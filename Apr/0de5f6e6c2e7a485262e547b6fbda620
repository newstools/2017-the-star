WWE fans believe that The Undertaker has brought the curtain down on his legendary career at Wrestlemania 33.The Deadman, who is 52-year-old Mark Calaway, was cleanly defeated by Roman Reigns in the headline main event at the Camping World Stadium in Orlando as he was pinned after a devastating spear.Taker was deservedly applauded out of the ring at the end as chants of "Thank you, Taker" rang out across the 75,000-crowd Citrus Bowl.And many WWE followers on Twitter have voiced concern that it indicates an emotional farewell for the seven-time world champion, saying goodbye at the 'Showcase of Immortals' for a final time.In a poignant moment, he rested his iconic leather coat and hat in the centre of the ring.Furthermore, Hall of Fame commentator Jim Ross was welcomed back to call what could be the Phenom's final match.The Undertaker debuted in WWE back in 1990 at Survivor Series.He then went on to lay down the marker to his iconic legacy as he embarked on an unprecedented streak at Wrestlemania , beating Jimmy Snuka at Wrestlemania VII in 1991.He went on to dominate the squared circle, winning 21 consecutive matches on the grandest stage of them of all.But that was shockingly ended by Brock Lesnar in New Orleans three years ago, when the former UFC heavyweight stunned The Undertaker - and the WWE Universe - with a devastating F5 finisher.The Undertaker did return after a year's absence in 2015 to defeat Bray Wyatt at the Levi's Stadium in California.He defeated Shane McMahon in a thrilling Hell in a Cell match at the AT&amp;T Stadium in Texas a year ago, with many speculating then that The Undertaker would retire.It appeared the result at Wrestlemania 33, however, was very much a ceremonial baton to the man of the future, Roman Reigns, who was headlining his third successive Mania.WWE superstar The Miz tweeted: "If there's a dry eye at #Wrestlemania you're a bigger man than me #ThankYouTaker"
