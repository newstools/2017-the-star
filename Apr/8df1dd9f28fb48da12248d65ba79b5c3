The Council of Legal Education has petitioned the Director of Public Prosecutions to take legal action against Moi University School of Law for misleading the public over its capacity to offer a Bachelor of Law (LL.B) degree programme.The council withdrew the university&rsquo;s license to offer legal studies in September 2015, after a series of audits and inspections.The council&rsquo;s report, dated September 23, 2015, noted the institution was &ldquo;severely incapacitated&rdquo; and could, therefore, not deliver the Law programme as initially anticipated.&ldquo;The institution lacks the wherewithal to provide quality legal education in consonance with the law, regulations and inspection guidelines set by the council,&rdquo; reads part of the report.An earlier decision in March 2015 also barred the institution from offering a Masters of Law (LL.M) programme.In a statement yesterday, CLE chief executive Prof Kulundu Bitonye said, &ldquo;Moi University&rsquo;s Council and vice chancellor Prof Laban Ayiro have gone to the press to tell Kenyans and assure students that they are a legal education provider&hellip;put simply, the press statements are false.&rdquo; He said the press statements issued on March 22, 23 and 28 contravene Section 43 of the Legal Education Act, which criminalises false statements from legal education providers. The LEA is mandated to regulate, license and supervise legal education providers in Kenya.It also approves qualifications obtained outside Kenya, administers professional examinations and advises the government on matters relating to legal education training.According to the audit report, Moi University got 36 per cent, way below the minimum threshold of at least 67 per cent that legal education providers should get to be allowed to operate. Areas found lacking include planning and governance, admission requirements, class size and enrollment data, curricular and modes delivery, examinations administration and academic staff qualifications.The university successfully challenged the decision to be stopped from offering the LL.B degree at the High Court, but the appellate court quashed the decision pending the determination of an appeal by the council. According to Bitonye, the university ignored an advisory requiring it to acquire a new license after its provisional license expired on September 30, 2015.&ldquo;The law is clear. In accordance with the Legal Education Act, current regulations and determination by the council, Moi University is not a legal education provider,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Where has the Council and Management of Moi University been since April 7, 2016, when the Council notified it of non-compliance?&rdquo; Bitonye said.
