ONE issue that remains unclear is whether NASA actually has a strategy or completely lacks one.If they have no strategy, then these are disjointed and dysfunctional people who are only waiting to bolt out in all directions &ndash; and uselessly.President Uhuru Kenyatta will then be seen to have infiltrated them so completely that he had them talking in tongues.Main story: Proposal for Raila ticket splits NASAWe started hearing the same narrative from Francis Nyenze; we heard the same from ODM; we heard it from ANC demonstrations on Monday and now from Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula.The theory could be they are now breaking up and this can be traced back to 1992, when the original Ford of Jaramogi Oginga Odinga disintegrated after then President Moi infiltrated it and completely undermined them. President Uhuru Kenyatta may have borrowed a leaf from his political mentor Moi and succeeded in destroying Opposition unity.Number Two, NASA&rsquo;s paralysis could be based on pure selfishness, on the grounds that the parties have realised that they just cannot defeat Uhuru and therefore they should go for regions where they are more predominant, with the view being to control these counties so that, for instance, if Kalonzo Musyoka can control his three counties in Ukambani plus one or two elsewhere, he is better off controlling five counties than becoming a person who has nothing inside NASA.The ANC might also be targetting the counties in Western, Wetang&rsquo;ula might be targetting his Bungoma county.Raila might be counting on the 10 counties that supported him at the last election. Or are they confusing Jubilee to make the ruling party lose its focus on them? Remember the nominations are coming: The only way to rope in everybody from their strongholds is for every principal to appear as if he is going to be given the ticket.We saw this when Kalonzo made it clear that he is moving away and people like Wavinya Ndeti closed their camps and joined Wiper; people like Charity Ngilu came over to them too.So it might be both a strategic and selfish way to rope in everybody, so that now Mudavadi becomes the undisputed leader of the Luyha nation and everybody takes their side with a view to demolishing any form of dissent so that by nomination time next week, everybody from those regions will be in lock-down in those parties.Advocate of the High Court and political analyst
