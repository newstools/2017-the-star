National carrier Kenya Airways has secured unlimited frequency of flights to Seychelles, boosting the airlines turnaround strategy. KQ has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Seychelles Tourism Board, which will allow the national carrier increase its weekly flights to five from the current four. Seychelles Tourism, Civil Aviation, Ports and Marines minister Maurice Loustau-Lalanne said Kenya Airways is, however, free to increase its flights to any number depending on its capacity."Kenya Airways is not restricted it can go even to seven or more. This is an open agreement," Lalanne said during the signing of the deal at the Ministry of Transport.The agreement is expected to promote tourism and boost intra-Africa trade, officials said. The agreement is also anchored on aspiration to strengthen the airline presence in Seychelles. Increased frequency will increase KQ's revenues, a boost to its ongoing recovery strategy as it strives to return to profitability."This partnership will also underscore the important role that Kenya Airways plays in the African economy development, specifically creating vital linkages between the continent and the international market on which tourism and other key sectors depend on and thrive, " Kenya Airways outgoing chief executive Mbuvi Ngunze said. Lalanne challenged KQ to ensure it has cargo capacity to handle exports and imports between the two countries, which could be boosted by the renewed bilateral trade agreements.Seychelles targets to export hundreds of tonnes of fish to Kenya, while it will seek to import flowers, vegetables and meat products, which they presently import from New Zealand, Australia and Brazil.Transport CS James Macharia affirmed the government's commitment to support Kenya Airways recovery strategy.He said the government is also keen to secure more bilateral agreements.
