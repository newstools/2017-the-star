The Ministry of Education and the TSC treated former Maseno School principal Paul Otula unjustly when it interdicted him, Maseno South ACK Diocese Bishop Mwai Abiero has said.Otula was interdicted following investigations into claims by a 16-year-old student that he had been sodomised by seniors at the school. TSC said Otula allegedly failed to end sexual molestation and bullying.Abiero said the action taken by the ministry is unfair as it did not give sponsors and the community an opportunity to be heard in the matter.&ldquo;The manner Otula has been treated is very sad and unfortunate. He has been ambushed and hounded as a criminal. How do you treat the country&rsquo;s heroes, who have been dedicated to the service of the nation?&rdquo; he said during a sermon at St Stephen Cathedral in Kisumu on Sunday.He said the ministry and Teachers Service Commission did not consult or listen to the board of management and the sponsor on seeking solutions to the allegation. His remarks come after the 10-member board of Maseno School resigned, saying they had been sidelined in decision-making. They accused the school&rsquo;s sponsor, the Anglican Church of Kenya, and the Education ministry of excluding them from important decisions. Board chairman Carey Orege said the church holds meetings with the ministry without engaging all stakeholders.However, the bishop said he is concerned with how the ministry and commission sacked Otula without thorough investigations over the alleged sodomy.Abiero said Otula had transformed Maseno School from getting 16 As to an academic giant.He said the church will not accept action aimed at negating education in one region.&ldquo;I am perturbed by this selective amnesia being applied by the ministry in schools in Western Kenya and we demand justice and professional treatment of the teachers&rdquo; Abiero said.He urged the ministry to name any school in Kenya that has not had allegations of bullying and sodomy. The cleric said the changing trends in society had posed serious issues on human behaviour and mob lynching of teachers must be stopped.The ministry must be ready to consult all stakeholders to resolve the issue of Maseno School and ensure Otula is accorded decorum and a fair hearing, he said.Otula, who has served at Maseno since 2001 after leaving Mang&rsquo;u High School, has been replaced by Andrew Buop, a former principal of Homa Bay High School.According to a letter from the Teachers Service Commission, Otula was sent on a 30-day compulsory leave to allow investigations.His interdiction comes even after Ministry of Education officials carried out a probe and concluded that sexual molestation and bullying claims could not be proved.
