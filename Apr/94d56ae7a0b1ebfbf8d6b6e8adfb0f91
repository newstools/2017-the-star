Kenyans should stop emotionally debating the use of genetically modified organism products but base arguments on facts, a professor has said.University of Embu chancellor Paul Musili said the development of biotechnology in Kenya has caused emotionally charged debate.He called for meaningful discussions and exchange of information on GMOs.Prof Musili said agricultural biotechnology has led to increased crop production with use of limited resources and without use of pesticides, thus protecting the environment.The development of biotechnology in Kenya is still in its early stages, but regulations to control it have been established, he added.Musili said Kenya faces serious challenges of food security, owing to climate change, global warming, change in rainfall patterns and dwindling water levels in dams, lakes, rivers and the ocean, and GMO technology will enable the country to produce enough food for its citizens.He said appropriate decisions on the matter should be made after research.Musili spoke at the university during an agricultural technology forum.Kenya banned GMO technology in 2012, but scientists have been asking the state to lift the ban.During a biosafety conference in Nairobi in August 2015, DP William Ruto said the government would legalise it after research showed that the technology would improve agricultural production, health services and environmental conservation.
