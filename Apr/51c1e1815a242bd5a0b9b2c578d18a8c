Transport has been disrupted in Tana River county after heavy rains washed away several roads, making them impassable.River Tana also broke its banks, flooding nearby areas. Roads heading to Lazima, Mwina, Bubesa and Sailoni villages are impassable.Residents have to walk as vehicles get stuck in the mud.The county is mainly home to the Pokomo and the Orma.Former Garsen MP Danson Mungatana, who is running for governor, on Monday walked to his campaign rallies after his vehicle got stuck in the mud.He has accused Governor Hussein Dado&rsquo;s administration of failing in its mandate to provide services.&ldquo;Dado has failed to develop the road infrastructure,&rdquo; Mungatana said.Dado ditched Wiper and will run on the Jubilee Party ticket. Mungatana had earlier said he would run on the JP ticket, but after Dado&rsquo;s defection he chose the Kenya Patriots Party. Mungatana says he will still support President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s reelection and urged all Tana River residents to vote for Jubilee at the national level.He said Dado&rsquo;s strategy to join Jubilee was to cause confusion in the party.Mungatana said despite parts of Tana River being agriculturally productive, Dado has not upgraded roads, making it difficult to transport produce to Mombasa and other markets.Mungatana comes from the Pokomo community, who are known farmers.The governor is from the pastoralist community.He said the governor has deliberately neglected some areas in the county.&ldquo;This area is one of the most productive in agriculture, but the governor has chosen to look down upon it,&rdquo; Mungatana said.He pledged to initiate small-scale irrigation schemes and open up the area to agribusiness.
