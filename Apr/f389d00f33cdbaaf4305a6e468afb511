Budalang&rsquo;i constituents will today nominate one candidate out of five ODM parliamentary aspirants who will battle it out with others in the August 8 general election. The five include former Budalang&rsquo;i MP Raphael Wanjala who defected to ODM from the Jubilee Party, Andrew Nakitare, David Obara, Leonard Obimbira and Albert Gumo. The contestants have been traversing the area to woo voters ahead of the primaries. Seven hopefuls, five from ODM, one each in Ford Kenya and Jubilee are seeking to unseat MP Ababu Namwamba, who will run on the Labour Party of Kenya ticket. Ababu is, however, unopposed and he will get a direct nomination. Other candidates who will also get direct tickets are Mediatrice Wangira (Jubilee Party) and Deogratius Adundo who is running on the Ford Kenya ticket.
