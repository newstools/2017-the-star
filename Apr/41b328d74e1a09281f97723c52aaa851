ANC officials from Bungoma branch have threatened to boycott party nominations set for tomorrow for lack of communication from party headquarters. The officials said their efforts to have a credible exercise is being frustrated by the national officials. Bungoma county branch secretary Martin Waliaula said they had written to the party&rsquo;s boss about the structures in place for the exercise. He said their efforts have been sidelined by the officials. &ldquo;We know certain people have fake party membership cards that they intend to use to rig in their preferred candidates and that is why we wanted the party register to help us verify our genuine members,&rdquo; Waliaula said.
