The council of public universities have agreed to work with the Commission for University Education to improve education standards.Education CS Fred Matiang&rsquo;i raised concerns about the quality of education offered at some institutions.In mid-February, the CUE released an audit report that revealed serious malpractices in public universities and questioned the credibility of degrees from some universities.The report found some universities issued executive degrees to undeserving students, violating admission criteria, lacking anti-plagiarism and quality assurance policies and were not adhering to the set lecturer-student ratios.The quality of school-based programmes offered by some universities was inadequate as some did not provide adequate contact time between learners and lecturers.The report also stated the authenticity of the process and security of academic documents and certificates in some universities was weak.The councils and the CUE agreed to rectify the areas of concern by adopting various reforms.They include the review of academic programmes to ensure they meet market needs as there is a mismatch between the universities&rsquo; output and labour market demands.They also agreed to rationalise the expansion of public universities to ensure student-staff ratios match available resources.The Ministry of Education recently ordered the closure of a JKUAT campus in Rwanda for failing to meet standards.Matiang&rsquo;i also suspended the opening of new campuses and satellite centres both in Kenya and other EAC member states.In a joint communiqu&eacute; prepared after an induction workshop in Naivasha on Monday and Tuesday, the councils also pledged to create synergy within the governing bodies of universities.Chancellors, councils, management boards, senates and students&rsquo; associations will collaborate in key decisionmaking in line with universities&rsquo; standards and guidelines. The councils also agreed to prioritise research and innovation and carry out qualitative analysis of their current research activities.
