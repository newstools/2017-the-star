The IEBC has launched an aggressive training programme for its staff to correct the errors of the March 4, 2013 election, which had massive technology failure.Starting today, top managers and technical staff of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission will be trained to operate the newly acquired equipment.The new system &mdash; the Kenya Integrated Electoral Management System &mdash; the fulcrum of the 2017 polls, will be deployed in the verification of voters from May 10.So far, French Company Safran Identity Limited has supplied 10,000 gadgets. Some 35,000 remaining kits are expected by early June.Preparing for electionsYesterday, IEBC communication manager Andrew Limo said the trained officers will then train lower cadre staff, including assistant registration officers, register of voters verification assistants and verification clerks.&ldquo;The programme aims to train all the staff on KIEMs and the process of verification of the register of voters. The officers trained will be expected to roll out the training in readiness for verification of the register of voters, which commences from May 10 at the polling centres,&rdquo; Limo told the Star.For the past six days, the IEBC has been training returning officers, deputy returning officers, county returning officers and its technical staff on the registration of candidates.They are also trained on electoral laws, the legal framework and the election results management framework.From July 12, the electoral agency will conduct a 26-day cascaded training up to August 6 &mdash; two days to the polls.&ldquo;This will be an operational training that will equip the trainees with the requisite knowledge and skills to run the August 8 election,&rdquo; Limo saidThe training will target returning officers, deputy returning officers, county returning officers, presiding officers, deputy presiding officers, polling clerks, ICT support clerks and all the technical staff of the commission.During the last election, the commission was unable to deal with technical hitches on Election Day due to inadequate preparation.On many occasions, electronic devices deployed in the field malfunctioned, or the IEBC staff did not know how to use them.
