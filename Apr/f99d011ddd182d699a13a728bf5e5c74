Perennial water shortages on four informal estates in Naivasha could soon become a thing of the past after the government launched a Sh143 million project to address the crisis.The estates are Kihoto, Karagita, Kasarani and Kamere. Housing secretary Patrick Bucha yesterday said the project will be completed in a year. The project is part of the ongoing Kenya Informal Settlement Improvement Programme to improve water systems, lighting, drainage and roads. Street lights have been installed on the four estates. Lakeview MCA Simon Wanyoike lauded the project.He said a high number of cholera cases has been reported in Kihoto because residents drink dirty water. &ldquo;The water used in this estate is from shallow boreholes which border latrines,&rdquo; Bucha said.
