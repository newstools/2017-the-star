In Matungu, some aspirants&rsquo; names were missing from the ballot papers.Losers in the nominations said the process was shambolic and said they will petition the dispute resolutions board to intervene.&ldquo;The level of unpreparedness and the degree of disorganisation that characterised the exercise was baffling, disheartening and an understatement,&rdquo; Andama said.Andola said he is ready for a repeat, promising his rivals to brace for a similar defeat.&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t win by chance. I prepared myself not for the nomination, but for the general election. The nomination is just a rehearsal of what the general election will look like in Khwisero. I am determined to ensure Khwisero remains an ODM-dominated zone,&rdquo; he said.
