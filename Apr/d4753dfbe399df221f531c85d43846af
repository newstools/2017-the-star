Hundreds of athletes training at Kamariny Stadium have been forced to suspend their training after the facility was closed for renovation.The facility is a landmark in the Iten town and both foreign and local athletes have been flocking the stadium to fine-tune themselves ahead of races.The athletes and coaches have now petitioned both the county and national government to offer them alternative training venue. While saying that they are not opposed to the construction, they said an alternative venue should have been availed before closing Kamariny for renovations.Led by former Niece marathon champion Elias Kiptum, the athletes said their training programs have seriously been inconvenienced by the latest development.&ldquo;Training in Iten is a big complicated without Kamariny,&rdquo; said Kiptum. Kiptum said the only other alternative for them was Tambach Teachers Training College, which is 11km away. Kamariny&rsquo;s face-lift started two months ago and has been allocated Sh287 million.
