Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter warned a section of officials working in DP William Ruto's office from interfering with Jubilee Party affairs.He told the lot to resign for "spoiling the Jubilee party" following the delays that marred the first day of the ruling party's primaries.The exercise did not kick off in most polling stations in time despite voters queuing from as early as 3am to cast their ballot."We demand that they leave office for interfering with Jubilee Party affairs," Keter told his supporters on Friday.The legislator said the Jubilee nominations need to be free from any form of influence by government officials."We want a free, fair and democratic process, so that we can have leaders that we want," Keter said.Keter was accompanied by Governor Jackson Mandago and a section of Uasin Gishu aspirants.Mandago vowed that the primaries in the region will not proceed as scheduled citing shortage of ballot papers."It is time we crack the whip. We registered more than 100,000 new voters so we must have enough ballot papers," Mandago said."We have agreed as aspirants and members of the public that the primaries be postponed."Earlier, the governor and Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi demanded the cancellation of the primaries."Over 95 per cent of aspirants are concerned that the nominations will not be fair," he said.Mandago is facing off with Bundotich Kiprop also known as Buzeki for the top county seat.Thousands of people lined up at the polling stations which were yet to be opened by as late as 9am.At the MV Patel polling station in Eldoret, voters complained that the delay is a tactic to rig the polls.More on this: Tuju warns aspirants against commenting on Jubilee Party primaries amid delaysOn Thursday, Uhuru warned against violence in the Jubilee Party primaries and ordered police to deal firmly with culprits.He said the party will not entertain such chaos and that "any acts of violence will lead to disqualification"."Chaos and violence that feature in primaries will not be tolerated.
