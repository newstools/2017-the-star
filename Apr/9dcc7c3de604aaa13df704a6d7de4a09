Opposition chief Raila Odinga is starring at a revolt in his political turfs, and his Nyanza backyard has been rocked by street protests over bungled nominations.On Wednesday, a top ODM director exposed how popular investigative journalist Mohamed Ali was allegedly rigged out of the nomination in Nyali, shining the spotlight on the credibility of the polls.Late last evening, the ODM National Elections Board suspended governor results in Migori and Homa Bay. The nullification of the results was a sigh of relief to aggrieved candidates and their supporters.However, this means that irregularities in positions of parliamentary seats and those of the county assemblies remain unchanged.Yesterday, protests erupted in Homa Bay county after incumbent Governor Cyprian Awiti was declared winner in an election that was marred by glaring inconsistencies.County returning officer Erastus Otieno said Awiti won with 46,343 against Kasipul MP Joseph Magwanga&rsquo;s 14,661 and ex-NIS Finance director Sam Wakiaga&rsquo;s 2,087.However, in Mbita constituency alone, Wakiaga was declared to have garnered 3,332 votes. Senator Moses Kajwang&rsquo; was declared the winner with 1,948, while his rival Fred Rabong&rsquo;o got 754, raising the question about the enormous difference between the governor and senator seats.In Migori, Governor Okoth Obado was declared the winner in a contest that was marred by rigging claims.Migori has been marked as a hot spot and has previously been rocked by violence pitying Obado and his fiercest rival, former Minister Ochilo Ayacko.There are fears the nomination fiasco may puncture Raila&rsquo;s presidential momentum as the National Super Alliance unveils its presidential lineup tomorrow. The disfranchised regions could become a battle zone between dominant ODM candidates and losers who might run as independents. Such a battle could see Raila spend a lot of time fighting fires in his traditional strongholds instead of seeking votes elsewhere.Already, there are complaints in Taita Taveta, one of the Coast counties perceived to be Raila&rsquo;s bastions.Wundanyi MP Thomas Mwadeghu&rsquo;s supporters stormed Orange House on Monday demanding the ODM ticket for Taita Taveta Governor race.The scores of supporters, shouting &lsquo;No Mwadeghu! No Raila&rsquo;, said their leader trounced Governor John Mruttu during the April 18 primaries.
