Nyandarua woman representative Wanjiku Muhia has urged voters to ignore lies peddled by their rivals that they have not delivered. She said aspirants for the seat are using deception to convince the electorate to vote them out in the August 8 general election. Muhia was speaking on Wednesday when she toured Mawingu, Miharati, and Wanjohi in Kipipiri constituency. She donated items worth Sh2.4 million to various groups. They include tents, two public address systems, two generators, 152 sheep and cheques valued at Sh1,060,000. Muhia said woman representatives didn&rsquo;t have a kitty but the government allocated them funds after they pushed for it. &ldquo;We have since implemented numerous projects that benefit our people,&rdquo; Muhia said. The lawmaker said their rivals had no interest in the seat until NGAAF was created. Muhia cautioned residents against voting for individuals who are making false promises.
