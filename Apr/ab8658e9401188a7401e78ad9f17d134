The people of Lower Eastern will have to wait longer for the construction of Thwake Dam following a pending appeal and MPs' recess.The National Assembly Agriculture Committee, which has been probing the matter, had asked Water CS Eugene Wamalwa to appear before it this week.The CS was to explain what the government intends to do to settle the matter and have the dam constructed on time. He failed to appear saying a handover process was ongoing at the ministry.More on this: CS Wamalwa to face agriculture team over Sh62bn Thwake dam The National Assembly went on recess on Thursday and it is now unclear how much time is left for the probe to continue. Only a short period is left before Parliament goes for its sine die recess in June to pave way for elections.The committee is reportedly determined to arrive at substantive findings for the expedited but transparent implementation of the controversial project in the shortest time available. Former Irrigation PS Patrick Mwangi was transferred from the implementing ministry, a move widely believed to have been precipitated by his unresolved differences with Wamalwa on the project. It remains to be seen whether this move will affect the project in any way.Just before his transfer, Mwangi had awarded the Tender to Chinese Company Sino Hydro STECOL, which, while not posting the lowest bid price, appears to have put together the lowest responsive bid for the tender.Read: You will pay if Kenyans lose Sh3bn in dam project, PS toldAlso read: Fresh trouble hits Sh62 billion Thwake Dam projectSino Hydro STECOL had bid at Sh36.9 billion and another Chinese Company, Gezhouba, at Sh36.6 billion.The bid by Gezhouba that appears to have been adjudged non-responsive by the ministry tender committee in view of Gezhouba having used the experience and credentials of associated companies that were debarred by the AfDB.They were barred at pre-qualification and debarred by World Bank at tender opening.Debarment by these institutions occurs where there is indisputable evidence of fraud and corruption by cited companies.In its letter of award to Sino Hydro STECOL, the ministry had also directed the company to renegotiate its bid using Gezhouba&rsquo;s lowest bidding price as an entry position. AfDB is financing 35 per cent of the total project cost and had raised issue on why the government was awarding the tender to the second lowest bidder.Records on the World Bank website show that companies that Gezhouba had cited as its associates were on the World Bank list of debarred companies.Sino Hydro is also on the list with a reprimand letter that expires on June 28, 2017.Gezhouba has now moved to contest the awarding of the tender to its fellow state-owned company at the Public Procurement Oversight Authority. The move is expected to stall further progress on the project as a solution is sought.
