In an exclusive interview with Word Is, the Yule Dem hit maker said she thought it was cool for her to take that step but to her surprise, a lot of Kenyan youth did not understand its value.Avril said it was cool to know her HIV status and further added that her decision to do HIV test was catalysed by a friend."I was with my friends one evening and we decided to just get tested... It's cool to know your HIV status."Although she was bold enough to post it, Avril went ahead to describe how fans went ham on her for doing it."I took the strips and they were all negative and I posted them on social media. It caused an uproar with people asking me: Who do you think you are? Why are you showing us your HIV status? Kwani unajishuku?...People talked and said really bad things."The Ukimuona hit maker revealed that many of her fans might have been afraid to get tested, hence the rant.
