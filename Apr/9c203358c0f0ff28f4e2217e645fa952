The postponement of ODM nominations in Kisumu and Siaya counties to today has not gone down well with many aspirants. They have accused the party of not consulting them.ODM, through the National Election Board chaired by Judy Pareno, postponed the process, citing unavoidable circumstances.&ldquo;The board regrets any inconveniences caused to aspirants and supporters,&rdquo; Pareno stated.On Sunday, the board cited security concerns as the reason for the rescheduling of the Kisumu polls. ODM communications director Philip Etale said the primaries could not proceed after an assessment of the security situation.This comes despite assurances from the security boss in Kisumu that they would ensure the process was free and fair.Kisumu county commissioner Mohamed Maalim on Sunday said officers will be on the lookout to ensure that the hotly contested nominations will be peaceful and there will be no idling at the 528 polling stations.The cancellation did not go down well with some aspirants in Kisumu.Governor hopeful Hezron Mc&rsquo;Obewa said it was unfortunate that the information was dispatched at the 11th hour.&ldquo;We expected formal communication from the office and not from the returning officer who had been missing the whole day,&rdquo; he said.Kisumu returning officer Tom Okong&rsquo;o reportedly informed aspirants of the decision on Sunday night, moments before the official statement was released.Mc&rsquo;Obewa said the cancellation greatly inconvenienced them as they had already dispatched their agents to polling stations.&ldquo;The new development not only inconveniences all stakeholders but brings into question the rationale behind the last-minute postponement,&rdquo; he said. Kisumu Central MP hopeful Richard Ogendo said they get most communication through the media. He said aspirants should have been given official communication before the statement was forwarded to the press. &ldquo;I understand they said there is a good reason behind it, let&rsquo;s hope so and it&rsquo;s just one day, we will wait for tomorrow,&rdquo; he told the Star yesterday. Most aspirants do not know who the county election board officials are after the first team was disbanded by the Political Parties Dispute Tribunal following claims that they were allied to various leaders.NEB secretary Bob Arunga said earlier that a new independent committee had already been constituted and included people from outside the county who are not allied to anyone. In Siaya, Bondo MP Gideon Ochanda said the cancellation is deliberate move to favour a few leaders. &ldquo;The materials can be made locally, so the party citing technical hitches as the key reason for postponing the polls does not hold water,&rdquo; he said. Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga said, &ldquo;I want to believe that the postponement will make the exercise more credible as the challenges will not be experienced.&rdquo;
