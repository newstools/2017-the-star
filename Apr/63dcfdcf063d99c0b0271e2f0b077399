The NLC has approved the transfer of 50 acres from KBC to Moi University&rsquo;s Odera Akang&rsquo;o campus in Yala, Siaya county.This will save the campus from closure, Education CS Fred Matiang&rsquo;i said.He said infrastructure recommended by the Commission for University Education will be built on the land in Nyamninia, which was occupied by KBC transmitter. He spoke on Saturday in Gem, accompanied by MP Jakoyo Midiwo and woman rep Christine Ombaka. The campus was named after legendary colonial paramount chief Odera Akang&rsquo;o famed for caning his subjects to force them to acquire an education. &ldquo;The university now will have 86 acres, which is more than the recommended minimum of 50 acres,&rdquo; Matiang&rsquo;i said.
