The Kenyan Coast is the most sought holiday destination in the country over the Easter holidays which kicked off yesterday, a survey done by online hotel search firm Jumia Travel indicates. Hotels in the region which stretches from Diani(Ukunda),Mombasa, Watamu, Malindi to Lamu accommodated 42 per cent of holiday makers, with more than 80 per cent domestic tourists.Nairobi comes in second with 23 per cent while Naivasha and Nakuru take third place at 20 per cent.&ldquo;While Nairobi makes a perfect destination for those ending the week&rsquo;s business with a bleisure trip (leisure plus business getaway), Nakuru and Naivasha are favoured as short-haul destination by locals,&rdquo; Jumia Travel East and Southern Africa managing director Estelle Verdier said.&ldquo;The region is easily accessed via adventurous road trips and without the hassle associated with long haul travel such as flights and terrain driving.&rdquo;Kisumu and the Mount Kenya region have attracted five per cent of travelers each, mainly city dwellers who have retreated back home for the holiday.Eldoret accounts for three per cent while the Maasai Mara has two per cent.&ldquo;Being an off season for the Mara triangle, the later comes in as the least popular. Perhaps due to lack of destination awareness, travelers tend to associate Mara region with the seasonal wildebeest migration, while missing on the bounteous wildlife and scenery that make the region,&rdquo; the report states.Three star hotels lead as the most preferred accommodation facilities taking up 34 per cent of all bookings.&ldquo;Being a family holiday, travelers are looking for hotels that balance between amenities, family friendly service and cost. Key amenities for families include child minders, provision of extra beds and cots where need be as well as family friendly setting,&rdquo; Jumia country manager (Kenya) Cyrus Onyiego said.Another major factor favouring three star stays, according to Jumia, is the provision of extra activities such as arrangements for sightseeing, park visits, sporting activities and family oriented entertainment.Amboseli national park leads as the most preferred park accounting for 29 per cent of Easter bookings in the wild.This is pegged on the ease of access by road and the rains which have favoured the presence of wildlife hence making it easier for animal sightings compared to other parks.Lake Nakuru national park takes second position at 22 per cent, while Aberdares has accounted for 15 per cent.Other parks are Samburu national reserve( 12 per cent), Tsavo East (( 12 per cent),Shaba national reserve(six per cent) and the Mount Kenya national park at five per cent.Nakuru and Naivasha lead in &ldquo;county tourism&rdquo;.
