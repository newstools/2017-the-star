Kalonzo Musyoka and Musalia Mudavadi held a one and a half hour private meeting on Wednesday amid a storm on who will be NASA flag bearer.The talks by the Wiper and Amani bosses are likely to deepen the storm in the National Super Alliance over who will face President Uhuru Kenyatta on August 8. The other principals are ODM's Raila Odinga and Ford Kenya's Moses Wetang'ula.It is not clear what Kalonzo and Mudavadi talked about at Wiper headquarters in Nairobi but it is believed they discussed the hotly contested ticket.The meeting came a day after ANC and ODM traded barbs over a leaked media report on the flag bearer debacle.The report carried by various media outlets stated that ODM's Raila Odinga will vie with Kalonzo as his running mate.ODM secretary general Agnes Zani on Tuesday said the media report was "accurate" but Amani secretary general Godfrey Osotsi later hit back and dismissed her remarks.He accused Raila's party of being behind the "dirty propaganda leaks", which he noted could affect the credibility and integrity of the process.Osotsi also accused ODM of negotiating in "bad faith" adding there is no general agreement for a Raila-Kalonzo ticket.Read: Proposal for Raila ticket splits NASAKalonzo said on Wednesday that they had not chosen a candidate and that "nothing is agreed until it is agreed"."If what was said by the ODM secretary general is true, then she has to withdraw publicly," he said."There are agents of confusion within and without us. I have seen comments by ANC...clearly, we cannot afford to go that way."He added that the "ball is not Raila, Kalonzo, Mudavadi or Wetang'ula but sending Jubilee home".More on this: NASA has no flag bearer, ODM must withdraw statement, says KalonzoMudavadi said those expressing dissatisfaction with the process should not be vilified.
