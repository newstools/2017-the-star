Eastleigh was among areas the UK had issued an advisory against travel in January. &ldquo;The FCO no longer advise against all but essential travel to the Eastleigh areas of Nairobi,&rdquo; read the statement on the website. They said this followed a review in the UK government's description of the threat from terrorism in travel.But the statement further indicated that there is no change in the UK government's assessment of the level of threat from terrorism in Kenya.The Foreign and Commonwealth Office went on to advise against all but essential travel to areas within 60km of the Kenya-Somali border, Garissa County, Lamu County (excluding Lamu Island and Manda Island).It also advised against areas of Tana River county north of the Tana river itself, within 15km of the coast from the Tana river down to the Galana (Athi-Galana-Sabaki) river. The FCO, however, did not advise against Kenya's safari destinations in the national parks, reserves and wildlife conservancies.The statement also did not include the beach resorts of Mombasa, Malindi, Kilifi, Watamu, Diani, Lamu Island and Manda Island. Although the statement read: "If you travel to Lamu Island or Manda Island, you should do so by air to Manda airport and not by road."
