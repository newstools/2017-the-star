A Mwingi court has summoned Dadaab refugee camp manager Jeremiah Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a to explain why he disobeyed orders to admit 29 refugees.The 29 were arrested on March 14 near Eastview Academy on Mwingi-Garissa highway in a covered lorry belonging to a maize miller.Most of them were suffocating when police rescued them.They were taken to court and each fined Sh50,000. The court ordered they be escorted back to the camp.Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a, however, denied them admission, saying they were not registered with the camp.He said the Nairobi database indicated the documents of some had expired.Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a allegedly told them there were no more admissions since the camp is set to be closed.The 29 have been staying at Mwingi police station until yesterday, when UN officers asked the Mwingi court to give the way forward on the accused.Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a is commanded to appear in court at 8.30am on April 10.He was ordered not to leave the area without being discharged by the court.In November, the government extended the closure of the refugee camp by six months to May, following a request by a special UNHCR envoy on the Somali situation. Kenya had vowed to shut Dadaab camp in November, saying it was being used by al Shabaab militants who continue to carry out sporadic attacks in several parts of the country. Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery said the extension gives the international community time to ensure refugees return to a safe place.
