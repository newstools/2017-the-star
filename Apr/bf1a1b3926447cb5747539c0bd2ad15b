Nyali MP Hezron Awiti, who defected from Kalonzo Musyoka's Wiper party, was on Tuesday officially received by Vibrant Democratic Party.Awiti will use the party to vie for Mombasa governor, a post held by popular ODM candidate Hassan Joho, in the August 8 general election. Other aspirants are&nbsp;Wiper's Hassan Omar and Suleiman Shahbal of Jubilee. "While in Wiper, I announced my intention to vie for governor only for another person to follow my trail just to frustrate the move," Awiti said on Tuesday.
