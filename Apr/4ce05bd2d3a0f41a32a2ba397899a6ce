The Kakamega governor told Otuoma to accept a repeat of the nomination as directed by the National Elections Board &ldquo;unless he has other options&rdquo;.He said the party&rsquo;s central committee chaired by party leader Raila Odinga is monitoring the nomination and will not hesitate to punish errant aspirants. &ldquo;That is why when we received a report linking nominated Senator Elizabeth Ongoro to violent activities, we recommended for a hefty fine,&rdquo; Oparanya said.ODM has fined Governor Okoth Obado Sh2 million and Ongoro Sh1 million over violence at party functions.Oparanya said the hefty fine is meant to deter other candidates who may want to disrupt the election process by promoting chaos and engaging in malpractice.
