They are capable of flooirng men,&rdquo; Ojiambo said.She appealed to politicians to preach peace during campaigns, adding residents should not witness a repeat of the 2007-08 post-election violence.She urged politicians to lead the country in the right direction, adding a lot has been done to build it and &ldquo;it should not be destroyed in a second simply because of leadership wrangles&rdquo;.She warned that reckless comments by some politicians could set the country ablaze.Last month, there was controversy over the legitimacy of Budalang&rsquo;i MP Ababu Namwamba&rsquo;s membership and leadership of LPK.Namwamba said he will back Uhuru&rsquo;s reelection bid as appreciation for the head of state&rsquo;s services to the constituents of Budalang&rsquo;i.
