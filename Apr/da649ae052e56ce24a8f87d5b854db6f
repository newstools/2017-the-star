Against the so called big teams in the Sportpesa Premier League, Western Stima have proved they can be on their game and this will be put to test when they face Ulinzi Stars at Afraha Stadium today. Stima's undoing, however, has been in their match ups against the lesser lights in the top division.&ldquo;There is no big or small team in the league. Every team has its strong points,&rdquo; observed Stima coach Henry Omino whose side arrived in Nakuru yesterday ready for this afternoon&rsquo;s clash.The soldiers have picked up an impressive eight points in four matches and Omino suggested their continental sojourn at the Confederations Cup that ended with their elimination by Egyptian side Smouha in the first round had been good preparation for the league kick off.&ldquo;Playing continental football obviously made Ulinzi match fit and ready for the league kick off and their results can attest to that. We expect an explosive match against them as we are also getting closer to the frequency we want to be in after playing four matches,&rdquo; Omino explained.Many thought Stima would kick start their season with the victory over Gor Mahia but since then Omino&rsquo;s charges have managed a point in two matches, picked from the draw with Chemelil Sugar over the weekend. But with most of his players likely to be passed fit for today&rsquo;s tie, there will be no excuse for not getting a positive result.&ldquo;We had slight knocks here and there which we will observe and make a final decision on before the match,&rdquo; Omino revealed.Ulinzi, meanwhile, will be keeping their fingers crossed and hoping their international players, who were in the Harambee Stars squad for the friendly with Malawi return in fine fettle. The trio of top scorer Samuel Onyango, goalkeeper James Saruni and versatile defender Brian Birgen have been a mainstay in Benjamin Nyangweso&rsquo;s starting 11 and he will hope they can at least make the bench today.
