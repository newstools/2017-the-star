Academics have for decades described Kenya as a society with a class divide in the classic Marxist-Leninist sense of &ldquo;workers of the world unite!&rdquo;But tribalism has masked Kenya&rsquo;s class wars since before Independence.The coming General Election&rsquo;s primaries have brought this fact to the fore, especially in capital city Nairobi and contiguous county Kiambu.For the first time ever, elements of the underclass are defying mainstream political parties and are set to capture political office by dint of the popular vote.The elite Kenyans and middle classes who fill social media with torrents of tribalist cant and taunts barely register to vote. Millions of their fellow countrymen and women who reside in informal settlements, slums and rural areas have registered to vote and did so at the primaries.The chattering classes&rsquo; idle arrogance has turned to talk of &ldquo;riffraff&rdquo; entering top political offices.The rise of the underclass horrifies the elite and indicates an uncertain future.
