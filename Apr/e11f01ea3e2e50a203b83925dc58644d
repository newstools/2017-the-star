Akaranga said they will throw their weight behind ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi.On Tuesday, more than 2,000 delegates converged at the Pentecostal Assemblies of God Church in Nyany&rsquo;ori, Vihiga county, and resolved to join NASA as an affiliate party.Akaranga said he has been given the mandate by the NDC to support Mudavadi&rsquo;s bid to secure the NASA presidential ticket.MCAs who joined PPK are Elizabeth Anaya (South Maragoli), Francis Ukiru (Izava), Stephen Mugalitsi (Chavakali), Zakayo Manyasa (Mwibona), Tom Atingo (Luanda Town) and Nathan Okila (Wemilabi). Akaranga said he will step up his campaigns in the county and beyond to popularise PPK. PPK national officials, including chairman Evans Misati and secretary general Clementina Osodo, were among officials present.&ldquo;I have not been attending NASA meetings because the party had not authorised me,&rdquo; Akaranga said.&ldquo;Many people have been questioning why I have not been attending NASA meetings. My political detractors have been spreading rumours that PPK is in Jubilee. The NDC&rsquo;s decision will bring to an end such politics.&rdquo;Misati urged aspirants to conduct peaceful campaigns, and said the party will take disciplinary action against anyone engaging in hooliganism.
