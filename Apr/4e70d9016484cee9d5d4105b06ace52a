Former Director of Public Prosecutions Philip Murgor yesterday pulled out of the presidential race only four months after declaring interest in the highest office in the land.Apart from the expensive campaigns, Murgor, who was running on a United Democratic Movement Party ticket, cited his &ldquo;late entry&rdquo; into the race, failure by electoral agency to tame early campaigns and the Inspector General of Police&rsquo;s refusal to assign him bodyguards.&ldquo;Upon declaring my candidature for the presidency, I immediately requested (IG Joseph) Boinnet for the provision of an armed police bodyguard for my personal security, both as a former Director of Public Prosecutions and a presidential candidate...&rdquo; he said in a long statement sent to media.&ldquo;The lack of personal security has therefore prevented me from traversing (not necessarily holding campaign rallies) the country like all other presidential candidates and party leaders, to market UDM as a political party, or my candidature generally, given the current violent nature of campaigns, political activity, and insecurity in the country generally,&rdquo; he added. Murgor who had promised to save the country from &ldquo;choking corruption, politics of ethnic exclusion and economic mismanagement&rdquo; also blamed negative ethnicity and poor media coverage for his decision to pull out of the race.Murgor, however, pledged to continue fighting corruption and tribal politics.&ldquo;The upshot is that, having reflected, and consulted with my family, friends and supporters, with profound regret, I have decided to pull out of the 2017 presidential race. I however assure Kenyans this is not the end of my determination to bring about positive, corruption free, detribalised politics,&rdquo; he said.He said he will continue to push for the &lsquo;awakening&rsquo; of citizens.
