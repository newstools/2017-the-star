A man claiming to have an innovative way of treating cancer has been milking patients of thousands of shillings in the pretext of applying little-known therapy.&lsquo;Dr&rsquo; William Njuguna, of Trinity Medical Centre in Ngong, has for the last two years been passing himself off as an oncologist trained in what he describes as a "unique and innovative" way of dealing with patients suffering from cancer.According to Njuguna, the Insulin Potentiation (IPT) Therapy he has been giving desperate patients is capable of not only treating cancer but is also effective against infectious diseases, arthritis and many other conditions.The quack claims he has been trained in the use of the therapy which was founded by Mexican doctor Donato Perez Garcia in 1932. It was originally intended for use in the treatment of Syphilis.IPT is an experimental treatment which has been presented as an alternative cancer regimen. Its proponents claim insulin enhances the effect of chemotherapy drugs allowing for usage of lower doses.While the therapy has been in existence since 1932, it has not been proven to work as there are no successful case reports. And any effect on tumor size demonstrated in some patients has been found to be temporary. But this is contradictory as the therapy also has the potential of actually promoting tumor growth. In addition, hypoglycemia can occur with low blood sugar levels posing a life-threatening risk.Without publication in peer-reviewed journals and with efficacy in question, oncologists view the therapy as alternative therapy with associated risks and do not endorse it.No long term outcomes, including of patient survival, have been published.In Kenya, Dr Andrew Odhiambo of the Kenya Society of Hematology and Oncology (KESHO) said the therapy is not licensed.&ldquo;I have not heard or read any indication to treat cancer. It is not a standard cancer therapy.&rdquo;Njuguna claims he underwent medical training in the United States but is not registered to practise. He declined to name the college.A search of the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentist Board&rsquo;s retention register indicates he has never been registered either as a general practitioner or as an oncology specialist.Faking to be a board memberDismissing proven and approved standards of careNjuguna runs St Anne&rsquo;s Clinic near Jamhuri Park with a nurse. While the facility is registered, you are hard-pressed to find Njuguna at the clinic, at least not with an appointment. The Star&rsquo;s attempt to contact 'doctor' were futile and despite trying to make an appointment for two weeks, there appears to be a last minute "emergency" every day.Medical board Chief Executive Office Daniel Yumbya promised to take action as part of an ongoing swoop against dodgy doctors.Njuguna is running for MP for Ol Joro Orok on a PNU ticket.Why you should stay away from this therapyViability of IPT therapy debunkedIPTLD does not work
