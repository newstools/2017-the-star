A Nairobi court yesterday ordered a graft case against former National Authority for the Campaign against Alcohol and Drug Abuse chief executive William Okedi to be heard in three days from May 3. The former CEO is said to have failed to comply with the law relating to procurement by approving payment of Sh12,826,066 to Ernst and Young. The firm was contracted to audit Alcoholic Drinks Control cash set aside to fund civil Society Organisations.Trial magistrate Felix Kombo of Milimani Anti-Corruption Court also ordered the next hearing to start from June 19,20 and 21.The hearing dates were fixed after the court was informed all parties are ready to proceed with the case. Okedi was charged after the High Court dismissed his application seeking to stop Director of Public Prosecutions Keriako Tobiko from charging him with the offences of Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Act of No.3 of 2003. Okedi is charged alongside former members of tendering committee John Muturi, Antony Munyui, Zeka Wekesa, George Murimi and Florina Mwikali.
