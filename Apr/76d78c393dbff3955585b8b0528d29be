Samburu North MP Alois Lentoimaga has denied threatening his opponents, saying they are only running away from shameful defeat.Mercy Lekimain, an aspirant who will battle the MP for a Jubilee ticket in next week's primaries, has reported him over death threats.She said Lentoimaga is merely trying to scare her from the race yet she is receiving massive support in the region.But the MP said Lekimain is only sensing defeat, noting that she has received a hostile reception."She has been eating cerelac as the people of Samburu face hardships; she doesn't even know the problems facing the people of Baragoi," he said on Thursday.He said Lekiman should not seek nomination through the backdoor."She is not campaigning to win the nominations or the general elections; we know she is looking for a nomination after the elections," Lentoimaga said."&rsquo;She should know that she will not win the elections and we will not give her the nomination she is trying to look for," he added.
