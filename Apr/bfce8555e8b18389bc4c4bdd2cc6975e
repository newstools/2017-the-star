A Bungoma MCA is fearing for his life and claims his rivals’ supporters threatened to behead him. Kimilili MCA David Baraza told journalists in Bungoma town on Friday, “I was shocked when I was seated with my friends on Wednesday evening at about 9pm in a hotel in Kimilili town and a man, who I know very well and works for my close competitor Robert Simiyu aka Mattress, arrived with boys and threatened to kill me.”. He said one of the 15 boys told him they have come to “take your head”. Baraza, popularly known as Webuye Jua Kali, said members of the public whisked him to safety. “I then went to Kimilili police station where I recorded a statement,” he said. Baraza, a Jubilee Party politician, asked Bungoma county commissioner Joshua Chepchieng to provide him with security. He asked rivals to shun violent and retrogressive politics and sell their agenda in a civilised manner. But Simiyu, popularly known as Mattress, denied threatening Baraza. He told the Star on the phone that Baraza is seeking sympathy votes because he knows he has not performed to residents’ expectations. “I’m going to beat him hands down on Monday during the Jubilee nominations and these are clearly signs that he has panicked because he knows the ground is singing Mattress tunes,” Simiyu said. He said Baraza is a known propagandist and alarmist. “It’s like when you are dating a girl and someone goes to tell her that you have epilepsy and in the real sense it’s a lie so that he can win her. So let him bring all those propaganda, but we are sending him home and he should be prepared for that,” Simiyu said.
