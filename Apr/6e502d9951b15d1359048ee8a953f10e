The Institute of Economic Affairs has warned that increased interest accrued from domestic borrowing may stunt the country&rsquo;s economic growth.This is in the wake of an increased public debt which the National Treasury has hinted could hit Sh3.77 trillion by end of this financial year on June 30.This is double the Sh1.89 trillion in June 2013 &ndash; the year the Jubilee administration took over the reins of power &ndash; due to heavy investment in infrastructure development.&ldquo;When we pay debt we pay part principle and interest. What we have noted is that the interest part has been growing because we are borrowing heavily and so it leaves very little money that can be used for other things,&rdquo; IEA Kenya senior economist John Mutua said on Thursday. IEA said that interest payment has been on an upward trajectory as lack of discipline in government spending sets a precedent for increased domestic borrowing.&ldquo;The government should shift from borrowing money domestically, although it is easier to get money internally, it ends up being very expensive and is due in a shorter term,&rdquo; Mutua said, during the institute&rsquo;s post budget analysis forum in Nairobi.According to IEA, management of borrowed funds will crowd out private investors, affecting macro stability, hence resulting in slow economic growth.&ldquo;This means that if we don&rsquo;t manage the money that we borrow, we may push away private investors and as a country we may not have money to pay even public workers such as the recent doctors and lecturers who were on strike,&rdquo; Mutua said. The Jubilee government plans to spend Sh1.347 trillion of the Sh2.62 trillion 2017/18 financial year budget on recurrent expenditure, and Sh640.3 billion on development. The budget deficit will be Sh524.6 billion, six percent of GDP. This will be financed through borrowing from both external and domestic sources. Treasury CS Henry Rotich, who presented next financial years&rsquo; budget to parliament on March 30, said net external financing will amount to Sh256.0 billion, 2.9 per cent of GDP, and will be mainly on concessional terms. Domestic borrowing will account for Sh268.6 billion. The Central Bank of Kenya latest quarterly Economic Review report (second quarter 2016/17, shows the value of debt stood at Sh3.763 trillion in March 2017, from Sh3.155 trillion a year earlier. Funds borrowed domestically increased 25.39 per cent year-on-year to Sh1.931 trillion in December 2016, from Sh1.540 trillion, while external debt grew by 13.45 per cent to Sh1.83 trillion from Sh1.62 trillion a year earlier.
