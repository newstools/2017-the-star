Former Kathiani MP Wavinya Ndeti has denied claims she has been issued given a direct Wiper ticket for governor ahead of the nominations next Friday.Outgoing East African Legislative Assembly MP Peter Mathuki is Ndeti&rsquo;s running mate.She said she will trounce incumbent Alfred Mutua.Ndeti addressed the press at St Jude Catholic Church in Athi River town pn Friday last week.Present were Mathuki and MPs Patrick Makau (Mavoko), Francis Mwangangi (Yatta), and Machakos woman representative Susan Musyoka.Ndeti said Kambas are united in their quest to ensure party leader Kalonzo Musyoka becomes President.&ldquo;If you are not with us, you will never be one of us,&rdquo; she said. NASA co-principals &mdash; Kalonzo, Raila Odinga, Musalia Mudavadi and Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula &mdash; are yet to announce who will be the presidential flagbearer.Ndeti urged Machakos leaders to unite and support Kalonzo.She said Kambas need to stick together and unite other communities.The MPs accused Senator Johnson Muthama of advancing the interests of Wiper&rsquo;s opponents instead of uniting with other Kamba leaders to support Kalonzo&rsquo;s presidential bid.Muthama has supported Raila&rsquo;s bid for the presidential ticket.&ldquo;We had a leader who could have led the nation in 2013 if it were not for the remarks made by Muthama,&rdquo; Mwangangi said.He said Muthama &ldquo;can go contest for a political position in Kisumu&rdquo;. &ldquo;We are ready to donate him,&rdquo; Mwangangi said. Mathuki urged other local leaders to join Wiper and work as a team.The MPs endorsed Ndeti&rsquo;s governor bid, saying she will help transform the entire Ukambani region.&ldquo;Ndeti will break the record by becoming the first woman governor in Kenya,&rdquo; Musyoka said.They called for peace during party primaries and on August 8.Makau warned politicians against inciting youths to violence.Two weeks ago, Bernard Kiala told Ndeti to prepare for tough nominations following her move to Wiper.He said Ndeti was welcome to the party, but must be ready to face him in the primaries.&ldquo;This is actually what we have been advocating. We all believe Wiper is the party that captures the aspirations of Lower Eastern residents,&rdquo; Kiala said.He said he was confident about winning, and urged Ndeti not to present any conditions for the nominations to be free and fair.&ldquo;The devil you know is better than the devil you don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Kiala said.He said he will work with Ndeti should she beat him.
