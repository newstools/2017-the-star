Politicians should not let party primaries divide their counties, ACK Katakwa Diocese Bishop John Okude has said.He said there can be no development when there is division.&ldquo;Let peace, love, unity and understanding be our cardinal rule in our endeavour to grow into God-fearing people instead of inciting peace-loving residents to start hating each other,&rdquo; Okude said.He spoke during an Easter service at Chepkarai Anglican Church in Mt Elgon.&ldquo;We need to go back to Christ who is the anchor and creator of our faith,&rdquo; he said, urging residents to live in harmony.Leaders should develop counties through concerted effort rather than let divisive politics override the unity that took time to achieve.
