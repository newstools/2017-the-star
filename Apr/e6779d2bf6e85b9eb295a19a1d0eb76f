The government might review the 50 per cent tax proposed on betting companies in the 2017-18 budget read on March 30.Speaking during the launch of the public information portal at KICC yesterday, President Uhuru Kenyatta said his government&rsquo;s intention is not to kill the gaming industry, noting there is room for negotiation.&ldquo;I know there is a big cry in the gaming industry. We can still sit down and engage with affected parties. But as a responsible government, we had to ensure that we make it difficult for Kenyans to bet,&rdquo; the President said.Two weeks ago, Treasury CS Henry Rotich (pictured) proposed to raise the tax to 50 per cent of gross profits from 7.5 per cent. The extra revenue, he said, will fund sports, culture and the arts. Rotich said the rapid growth of the betting industry in a loosely regulated environment has hurt the young and vulnerable.Kenyatta echoed CS&rsquo;s sentiments, saying the betting craze has had a devastating effect on schoolgoing children and it needs to be tamed.During the event, Uhuru encouraged Kenyans, especially youths, to join technical and vocational training centres. This was after Deputy President William Ruto indicated there is a huge skills gap that needs to be bridged.President Uhuru indicated his administration has focused heavily on skilled workforce, and 160 technical colleges will be opened countrywide.&ldquo;Our government will spend Sh15 billion to equip the training colleges so that we can have more Kenyans educated in the said sector. We have focused so much on university education, but for us to make Vision 2030 a reality, we need such skilled workers,&rdquo; he said.He said his government will prioritise technical education and building of roads and railway, as they remain key to attaining the development needs of the country. &ldquo;We have, however, managed to rehabilitate the Kipchoge and Kisumu stadiums,&rdquo; Uhuru said.
