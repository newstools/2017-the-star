Jambo jet plans to stabilize its key routes in the country and extend its services to the East Africa region.Already the company, which is celebrating its second anniversary, intends to acquire two new air crafts in May and November this year so as to ensure their operations are smooth.The airline which is an affiliate of Kenya Airways said their aim is to ensure there are no longer unnecessary delays, and provides efficient services to their clients in the existing routes before venturing outside the country.Jambo jet CEO Willem Hondius told journalists that the company has already acquired a new aircraft (in January) which is already in service on its key routes.Speaking during the official handing over of a water reservoir project at Manda primary school in Lamu on Thursday, Hondius said delays experienced by the flight will be no more.In December, the airline experienced massive delays that led to complaints by many passengers.Hondius said the company had planned to have the new airline before December but it was delivered in January.He said currently their operations to six destinations in the country have seen tremendous increase in the number of passengers in the first year.In Lamu alone, the CEO said they recorded 33,000 passengers in the first year with the second year recording 50,000.He said the company is now projecting 70,000 passengers at the end of the year.He said the airline expects many more passengers following the lifting of travel advisories against Lamu by key tourist markets, with the latest being the UK.He said the new aircraft flying from JKIA, Malindi to Lamu daily is efficient.The destinations complement its existing flights to Eldoret, Kisumu and Mombasa, Hondius said, as it targets the growing domestic travel market in the East African countries comprising of tourists, traders, investors, government workers and employees of local and international aid agencies.&ldquo;With this growth we intend to increase additional flights within Kenya with new routes like Wajir , Zanzibar, and Entebbe,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said.The water harvesting project commissioned at the drought stricken Manda primary school is part of the company&rsquo;s corporate social responsibility in all the cities they operate in.He said the Manda project is ideal to alleviate the suffering that residents undergo to fetch fresh water from Lamu island. &ldquo;School going children shall be able to concentrate in their class work unlike before when they used to spend more time looking for water,&rsquo;&rsquo; Hondius said.Musa Ndiema, the school head teacher, said the water shortage has led to absenteeism and poor education standards in the area.
