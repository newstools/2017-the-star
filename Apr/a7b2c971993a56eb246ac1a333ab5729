The Friday Jubilee Party nominations will be an acid test for Bumula MP Boniface Otsiula.Otsiula is facing stiff competition from former New Ford Kenya Bungoma chairman Martin Nyongesa and retired county commissioner Cornelius Wamalwa.Speaking to the Star yesterday, analyst Isaac Wanjekeche said Nyongesa is the only candidate who could beat Otsiula because he worked with him and led his campaigns in the 2013 election.&ldquo;Nyongesa is set to give the incumbent a run for his money ... He has networks,&rdquo; he said.Wanjekeche said, however, that Otsiula enjoys the backing of his Batura clan that always votes as a bloc and consider themselves marginalised.
