The Jubilee Party National Elections Board is under pressure for its alleged reluctance to bar aspirants whose integrity has been questioned.Voters have written to the party raising concerns about JP&rsquo;s silence, despite it receiving petitions.The integrity of six contestants, three of them from Nairobi county, has been questioned.Jubilee secretariat chief Raphael Tuju last month assured aspirants of a fair process and warned that those who fail the integrity test will be barred from running, even if they win the nominations.Party members have said President Uhuru Kenyatta has been at the forefront in the fight against corruption, so his party should not clear aspirants with integrity issues.Petitions before the party include one on Embakasi Central MP John Ndirangu. Two people wrote letters saying he is not fit to serve.Last week, the party blocked Nyeri governor aspirant Thuo Mathenge. Although the party had accepted his nomination papers, it later refused to clear him, saying his academic papers are questionable.The party has also been asked to block Mukurweini aspirant Anthony Githiaku Kiai on grounds he was struck off the roll of advocates through a gazette notice on January 16 over professional misconduct.Over the past two months, voters have petitioned the party to check the past conduct of Belgut aspirant Nelson Koech, Kapsaret MP Oscar Sudi and Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko.Uasin Gishu governor aspirant Zedekiah Buzeki has also been sued by a voter over his academic papers.The party has also been petitioned to probe former Eldoret South MP and Uasin Gishu woman representative aspirant Peris Simam.She was last year convicted in a corruption case and jailed for a month before paying a fine.
