The Ministry of Health will this year distribute more than 15 million mosquito nets countrywide.As Kenya marks World Malaria Day today, Health CS Cleopa Mailu (pictured) says his ministry has distributed 16 million long lasting insecticidal nets in 36 counties.The event will be held in Narok, and this year&rsquo;s theme will be: End Malaria for Good.About 63 per cent of households in Kenya own at least one LLIN , an improvement from 44 per cent in 2010.To sustain and enhance coverage, the ministry will continue routine distribution of LLIN&rsquo;s through health clinics, and distribute another 15.6 million planned for the 2020 mass campaign.Mailu said use of nets has increased from 61 per cent to 71 per cent for the past five years, but there still exist gaps.&ldquo;The use of LLIN is the key intervention for prevention against malaria, which are distributed through mass campaigns, routine maternal and child welfare clinics,&rdquo; he said.Malaria remains a public health problem in the country with about 70 per cent of the population at risk of the disease.Being a socioeconomic burden, malaria requires a sector-wide participation which has not been exploited with relevant non-health sectors. These are the challenges the ministry seeks to address gradually.The ministry has fumigated more than 200,000 houses in Migori county to reduce mosquitoes. The Indoor Residual Spraying was concluded last month in the area. &ldquo;IRS is a costly intervention and funding gaps may hamper achievement of the planned scope,&rdquo; the CS said.
