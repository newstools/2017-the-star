Just imagine if we understood Lion speak!... Cleo the little lion cub lay on her back with her mother in the long, soft, green grass, under the tall leafy trees, almost next to the main gate. As Cleo lay there for some time, a low, grumbling noise could be heard occasionally: &ldquo;Mama! What is that noise we keep hearing?&rdquo; Mama replied in a knowing tone: &ldquo;Well, my cub. We know them as &lsquo;grumble-shines&rsquo;. They have strange rolling legs and always seem to be in a mood, as they growl wherever they go, and they also do not smell good and are filled with humans.&rdquo; Cleo thought for a while and then said, &ldquo;But Mama, why do so many &lsquo;grumble-shines&rsquo; go past us all the time?&rdquo; Mama replied: &ldquo;Well, my cub, there are many theories, but the baboons seem to know the main reason after listening carefully to the humans talking, as I listen to the baboon jabber-jabber-jabber every day, and my understanding is that the many humans go through the gate in their &lsquo;grumble-shines&rsquo; to look for lions! They are known to rumble around for hours in the heat and dust, just to try and find one of us, then when they see us, they point funny things at us that click and sometimes flash brightly, and some of them even climb on top of their &lsquo;grumble-shines&rsquo;.&lsquo;Wow, Mama! That is really crazy!&rdquo; said little Cleo. &ldquo;We relax here all day in the cool shade, while they must get so hot in their &lsquo;rumble-shines&rsquo;.&rdquo; Seeing lion cubs is always a cute moment, but in reality, very few of them survive the struggle to grow up as adults.The park is open daily from 06h00 to 19h00.For more information on the park you can link to the following websites www.kws.org or www.nairobigreenline.org or on Facebook.
