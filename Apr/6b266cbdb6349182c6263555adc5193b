Harambee Stars squad of home-based players failed to douse The Flames of Malawi after their international friendly match at the Kenyatta Stadium, Machakos, ended in a dour goalless stalemate.Documentation problems had deprived coach Stanley Okumbi the opportunity to blood a few new faces and use fresh legs fro the friendly that came just twenty four hours after some of the call ups had featured fro their teams Western Stimas Fred Shimonyo, Kariobangi Sharks defender Pascal Ogweno, Zeka Wakoli of National Super league side GFE 105 and Chris Masinza with Geoffrey Kataka and David Mwangi late inclusion into the squad.Okumbi thus was forced to use Cavin Odongo of Kariobangi Sharks,Simon Mbugua, captain for the day Joakins Atudo and Patrick Matasi of Posta Rangers from the start despite their club having played twenty four hours earlier. Stars, as expected, began the clash on the front foot with Samuel Onyango failing to test Malawi goalie Ernest Kahobwe when an opportunity materialized.Sharks debutant Bolton Omwena was struggling to cope with the pace and nifty feet of Kevin Anganda with the latter sending a dangerous cross that Matasi did well to collect. Stima&rsquo;s Kennedy Otieno had another good chance for the hosts, heading over an inviting cross fromMbugua as the half drew to a close.Stars made a change just before half time with Daniel Mwaura taking up the place of Darius Msagha but the scoreline remained defiant. The cohesion that had been missing in the Stars&rsquo; game in the first half started to appear in fits and starts. Agogo and Samuel missed good scoring opportunities in the opening ten minutes of the second half as Kenya piled on the pressure in search of the opener to no avail.That led to the introduction of another attacker with Sony Sugar&rsquo;s Amos Asembeka joining the fray. Despite the huge percentage of possession, Stars struggled to break down the Malawians forcing Atudo and at times, Samuel to try their luck from range to ill effect. kataka was to prove to be Okumbis final roll of the dice but ultimately the final scoreline was just about what both sides deserved.
