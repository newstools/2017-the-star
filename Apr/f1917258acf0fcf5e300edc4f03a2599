Dozens of children are among those killed in devastating mudslides in south-west Colombia, according to President Juan Manuel Santos.The total death toll has surpassed 200, with hundreds also injured.Heavy rain flooded the town of Mocoa in the country's south-west, with mud and rocks burying whole neighbourhoods and forcing residents to flee their homes.More than 1,000 soldiers and police are involved in the relief effort in Putumayo province."Until we have the last person identified we are not going to stop," said President Santos, who flew to the area on Saturday after the landslide struck.The relief efforts continued throughout the weekend.He said the current death toll was 207, out of which 170 had been identified, including 44 children.The army had previously reported 200 people missing, but the president tweeted on Sunday afternoon that there were officially no disappeared persons.Earlier in the day, video footage from Mocoa showed residents crying over a list of missing children, with their names and aged pinned to a board."We have lost a baby, who has gone missing," one resident told reporters. "A little baby, we can't find him anywhere."Another woman told reporters she was desperately seeking her two daughters and one young granddaughter."Whether they are dead or alive, I just want to see them," she said through tears.
