Kiambu Governor William Kabogo is known to love a flashy lifestyle but it is not everyday that one uses an armoured military vehicle to escort the President.On Wednesday, as President Uhuru Kenyatta toured Kiambu, Kabogo ensured that his armoured Iveco LMV was in the entourage.The Iveco LMV or Light Multirole Vehicle is an innovative tactical vehicle, developed to reduce threat posed by improvised explosive devices and landmines.One wonders if Kabogo rides in the vehicle for security reasons or in a show of his flamboyance.The heavy duty vehicle&rsquo;s cost is estimated to be between Sh20 million and Sh30 million.Kabogo has admitted a love for state of the art machines and owns a large number of cars and motorbikes, which he has used at Kiambu TT races.
