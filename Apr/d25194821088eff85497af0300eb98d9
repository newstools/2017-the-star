Kenyans will have to wait longer to know the NASA flagbearer after the Vipingo Ridge talks in Kilifi county on Sunday failed to yield results.All the four NASA bosses ODM leader Raila Odinga, Wiper&rsquo;s kalonzo Musyoka, ANC&rsquo;s Musalia Mudavadi and Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula of Ford Kenya were holed up at the Vipingo Rigde late into the night to negotiate on the flagbearer.Kalonzo yesterday said the agenda that was discussed in detail was the strategy to defeat the Jubilee Party in August.He told Wiper supporters in Majengo Kanamae, Kilifi South constituency, that they agreed to form polling station committees all over the country.Kalonzo said votes of all seats shall be announced from the polling stations before being relayed to the Bomas of Kenya for the final tallying. He said it will be difficult to change anything after the announcement at the polling station.This means out of the 290 constituencies and 45,000 polling stations countrywide, there will be committees of five people each to keep data that would be relayed directly to NASA headquarters. Kalonzo said the five-member committees&rsquo; sole mandate will be to prevent any rigging.
