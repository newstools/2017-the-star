Only six of ODM elected MCAs in Kakamega county won Saturday nominations to run for election, in what analysts say could be a sign of waning strength by the Orange Party.Seventeen ODM MCAs had vied in the primaries.The Orange Party had 35 elected MCAs in Kakamega. The party had earlier given direct tickets to 14 MCAs and four decamped to other parties.ODM also lost three of the five MPs elected on the party ticket during the primaries that were marred by irregularities. Raphael Otaalo (Lurambi), Silverse Anami (Shinyalu) and Andrew Toboso (Butere) were defeated.The nominations are to be repeated in Khwisero where incumbent Benjamin Andola is likely to lose again, according to analysts.Political scientist Prof Frank Matanga of Masinde Muliro University said the massive loss by ward representatives could be because they were not popular enough to defend their seats.&ldquo;They were either imposed on the people, which is tradition with Kenyan parties, or simply benefited from the Cord wave in 2013 and that is why they could not convince the electorate,&rdquo; he said.The outcome indicates that there is a new kid on the block in Western in the name of ANC, which is likely to take over the ODM space in August, Matanga said in Kakamega yesterday.There is no guarantee that those who were granted direct tickets will win given the massive defeat of those who were subjected to primaries.The MCAs who were defeated included Dickson Ombayo (Nzoia), Wycliffe Gimoi (Butali), Joe Serenge (Shirere), Aggrey Waturasu (Sheywe), Bernard Lukulu (Idakho North), Isabella Mung&rsquo;asia (Idakho East), Michael Keya (Marama Central), Suleiman Odanga (Mumias Central), Francis Mulama (Musanda), Florence Machio (Shinoyi) and Wycliffe Pisi (East Wanga).ODM handed direct tickets to Timothy Ingosi (Likuyani), Hilton Luvai (Sinoko), Robert Makhanu (Kongoni), Edward Indimuli (Kabras East), Jason Lutomia (Chimuche), Wycliffe Mukoko (Ingotse-Matiha) and Rashid Omwendo (Mumias North).Others are Lucas Radoli (Malaha-Makunga), Sayyed Omusiritsa (Marama North), Swaka Limera (Kisa North), Joel Ongoro (Kisa East), Elphas Shilosio (Murhanda) and Danston Mukofu (Isukha Central).Bryson Sikolia, Patrick Lumula and Benson Sikuri decamped to Amani National Congress, while Reuben Nyangweso switched to the Maendeleo Democratic Movement.Out of the 12 MP seats in Kakamega county, ODM won six in 2013 but Enock Kibunguchy of Likuyani decamped to Ford Kenya two years ago, citing frustration by Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya.UDF won four seats in Ikolomani, Lugari, Mumias East and Navakholo, while MDP won the Malava seat.
