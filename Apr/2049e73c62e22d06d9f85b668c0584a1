A row is looming in Narok governor aspirant Patrick Ntutu&rsquo;s camp over his choice of running mate. Two groups from the Kipsigis community have fronted two candidates for the position.Ntutu (pictured), who is also the Narok West MP, will run on the Chama cha Mashinani ticket, against Governor Samuel Tunai of the Jubilee Party and former ICT PS Joseph Tiampati of ODM. On Sunday, some elders led by Joel Ruto said their candidate is former Kilgoris CDF project manager Weldon Rop from Transmara West. Another group from Narok South subcounty endorsed former high school teacher Agnes Busienei for the post.
