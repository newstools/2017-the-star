President Uhuru Kenyatta yesterday urged Jubilee Party politicians who lost in the nominations to continue working with his administration.He assured them of positions in the government.Uhuru said the wind of change that swept most of his sitting lawmakers in the just-concluded primaries shows Kenyans are fed up with leaders who fail to deliver and account for their five-year tenure.&ldquo;Those who lost will not be left behind and should accept the people&rsquo;s decision and come work with the Jubilee administration. Those who won should listen to what the people have said and do according to their expectations,&rdquo; he said.Uhuru spoke when he made a surprise visit to JP headquarters at Pangani Junction, Nairobi.He said the JP nominations were free, fair and transparent, despite hitches at the start of the exercise last Friday.Last Saturday, Uhuru and Deputy President William Ruto admitted that underplanning led to the bungled exercise that was to be conducted in 21 counties.&ldquo;The party and the secretariat have done and fulfilled what we promised. This nomination by Jubilee in 2017 will remain in the history of this nation as having been conducted in a free, fair and transparent manner for giving Kenyans the opportunity to choose the leaders they want,&rdquo; he said.The party&rsquo;s Disputes Tribunal Board vice chairman Hillary Sigei yesterday afternoon said they had only received 13 complaints from aspirants countrywide.They include one governor, three MPs and 10 MCAs. He said the tribunal has started hearing the complaints.The National Elections Board chaired by Andrew Musangi had given aspirants 48 hours to file complaints with the tribunal after the nominations.Uasin Gishu governor aspirant Kiprop Bundotich, alias Buzeki, filed the complaint with the tribunal, raising concerns over voting hitches. He claimed this denied his supporters a chance to vote.His case was to be heard yesterday, but was postponed because he had not served the petition to his rival Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago. Mandago garnered more than 126,000 votes against Buzeki&rsquo;s more than 89,000 votes.Gatundu South aspirant Joyce Ngugi lodged a complaint against the election of incumbent MP Moses Kuria.An aspirant who lost the Kilgoris parliamentary race petitioned the tribunal.Starehe MP aspirant and musician Charles Njagua, alias Jaguar, accompanied by his supporters also launched a complaint, disputing incumbent Maina Kamanda&rsquo;s win.&nbsp;
