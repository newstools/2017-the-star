The government is committed to eradicating Malaria in Kenya, Health CS Cleopa Mailu said yesterday.To achieve this, it will work with partners this year to distribute more than 15 million of long-lasting treated mosquito nets to curb spread.Beneficiaries of the nets will be pregnant mothers, children under five and other vulnerable groups in 23 malaria-prone counties.The remarks were made in a speech read on his behalf by Director of Medical Services Jackson Kioko during this year&rsquo;s World Malaria Day marked in Narok.The theme was &lsquo;End Malaria Now&rsquo;. The Kiswahili rallying call was &lsquo;Pamoja Tuangamize Malaria&rsquo; (Lets end malaria together).Mailu urged healthcare providers to adhere to the three Ts &mdash; Test, Treat and Track (monitor) &mdash; in malaria treatment to avoid recurrence.He added that the ministry has bought enough malaria test kits and told the county governments to order in good time to avoid last-minute rush during an outbreak.Mailu said although Kenya has made strides in combating Malaria by reducing cases from 11 per cent in 2014 to about eight per cent today, more needs to be done.He called for concerted efforts in making Kenya Malaria-free.The CS said the aim of supplying long-lasting treated nets is to reduce malaria infections. The nets have been treated with a chemical that remains active for many years and does not lose its strength even when washed. Commenting on the new malaria vaccine launched in the country yesterday, Kioko said it will be administered to the under-five alongside other vaccines on a pilot basis until next year, when it will be adopted in the country as a full vaccine.&ldquo;We&rsquo;re taking time to observe the vaccine&rsquo;s performance and public reaction before it is adopted,&rdquo; he said.Kenya, the Gambia, Ghana and Malawi were chosen by the World Health Organisation for the pilot programme. Kioko said the ministry will deploy medical staff and modern equipment to the new renal units in Kilgoris and Narok referral hospitals, adding that a state-of-the-art Intensive Care Unit will be built in Narok Referral Hospital.Narok was chosen to host the national Malaria event this year due to increasing Malaria cases in the county. It has more than 28,000 cases of malaria every year.Malaria is the fifth killer disease in Narok after diarrhoea and pneumonia, among others. Hard-hit areas are Ongata-Barakoi, Marura, Ngararu and Lolgorian in Transmara.
