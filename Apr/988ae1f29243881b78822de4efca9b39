ODM has held the police responsible for the chaos that marred its primaries and accused the security agencies of colluding with the Jubilee Party to discredit its nominations. Secretary general Agnes Zani said police have been slow to take action against the perpetrators of violence in ODM areas, but quick to act when it comes to JP. “The National Police Service is only giving security to Jubilee areas. The presence of the police appears to be cosmetic in ODM areas,” she said during a press conference at Orange House yesterday. Zani cited the violent incident in Migori on Thursday where youth attacked and injured election officials during a meeting. She said they were captured on camera, but no arrests have been made. “Thugs are being left to run amok and to rule areas like Migori with reckless abandon, but in Jubilee areas the police are ensuring there is no such breakdown of law and order,” Zani said. Thugs have been hired and are enjoying police protection to disrupt ODM primaries and portray the party as violent, the nominated senator added. “We hold the police responsible for all the violence that occurs in those areas where the indications already exist but the police are refusing to take action,” Zani said.
