President Uhuru Kenyatta yesterday directed the government to release Sh1.2 billion to implement recommendations to increase profits from miraa. He issued the directive on the money, which was allocated earlier in the budget, after a task force he formed to give recommendations on the miraa sector presented its report at State House, Nairobi. Key among immediate recommendations of the Miraa Task Force is providing seed capital for farmers to access affordable credit. The government will set up a scientific study at Kemri in collaboration with the European Union to develop a scientific basis for getting the crop&rsquo;s restrictions lifted in parts of Europe. Miraa farmers will registered to facilitate target intervention and eliminate possible fraud. The report says a miraa farmer-controlled agency should be formed. Uhuru said priority areas should be implemented in a year.
