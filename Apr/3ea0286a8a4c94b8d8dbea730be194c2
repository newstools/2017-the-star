The Kenya Plantations and Agricultural Workers Union has raised concerns over the high number of flower farm workers losing jobs in Naivasha.As the country marks Labour Day, the union has said more than 5,000 workers have lost their jobs in two years.There are fears the numbers could rise in the coming months, as farmers complain of harsh economic times, coupled with poor market in the EU.Karuturi Flower Farm closed doors last year and sent home more than 2,500 workers after it was placed under receivership over debt.The leading and oldest flower farm, Oserian Ltd, also sent home more than 400 workers. The farm attributed the layoff to the high cost of production.
