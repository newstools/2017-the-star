Politician Simeon Mkalla has blamed people Kwale governor aspirant Chirau Mwakwere for causing him to abandon the ambassador and join another hopeful.Mkalla ditched the Mwakwere (Wiper) for Issah Chipera of ODM.Chipera will be facing off with Kwale assembly speaker Sammy Ruwa, former Forestry PS Mohammed Mwarapayo and businessman James Dena in the Saturday ODM nominations.Speaking to the Star on the phone, Mkalla said, &ldquo;I was not given respect that a deputy governor is supposed to be given by the people surrounding him. My decision to move out is not good for his political ambition.&rdquo;Mkalla unsuccessfully ran for governor in 2013, coming in the second after Salim Mvurya, a support Mwakwere was depending on.He warned Mwakwere that his campaign team will destroy his ambition as they forced him out.&ldquo;I did the best when he was in Tanzania. I also did my best when he came back. But there are people who think my being in Mwakwere's team was not working well for them because we don&rsquo;t think the same,&rdquo; Mkalla added.The former Kinango MP said Chipera stands a better chance of winning the Kwale governor seat.&ldquo;This is a serious blow to Mwakwere and benefit to Chipera who will get a lot of votes from where I come from,&rdquo; he added.Mkalla said, however, that politicians should remain united regardless of their background.&ldquo;Even if we have differ, we will still talk,&rdquo; he added.Mkalla and Mwakwere were last week endorsed by Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka at a rally in Kinango.Mwakwere's close ally Mohamed Mwamrezi dismissed claims that they have suffered a blow, saying they are ready for the election without Mkalla.&ldquo;Mkalla thought Mwakwere was going to remain in ODM and not move to Wiper and so he had no other reason of leaving our team,&rdquo; he told the Star.&ldquo;There is democracy and therefore he has the right to go anywhere.&rdquo;Mkalla said that he offered to support Chipera as his running mate assuring supporters that their government will create jobs.Speaking at St Joseph Hall in Ukunda on Monday after joining Chipera, Mkalla said they will consider both skilled and unskilled youths for job opportunities.Chipera said, &ldquo;When Mwakwere was in Tanzania, Mkalla was representing him as his deputy in all the ODM meetings. But when Mwakwere came back he stayed in ODM for only two weeks and jumped to Wiper that is why Mkalla has come back because he cannot leave ODM.&rdquo;He promised to improve the county's leadership and governance situation if elected.
