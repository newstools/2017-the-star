She has proved that Kenyan women are resilient and world beaters.&rdquo;Keitany&rsquo;s time of 2:17:01 is a new women&rsquo;s only world record.&ldquo;Before the 2017 London Marathon, Keitany was the second fastest woman of all time, only second to Paula Radcliffe, today, Keitany is now second to none with a new world record of 2:17:01; this gives us much to celebrate and to be proud of as Kenyans,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;To our Kenyan girls and young women, emulate the strength, discipline and ethics that Mary Keitany, Edna Kiplagat, Sarah Chepchirchir, Florence Kiplagat and athletes like Catherine Nderaba, Tegla Loroupe, Rose Tata Muya and many others before them. Learn from these great champions, these are your true role models you need to emulate.&rdquo;Other Kenyans who have performed well in current World Marathon Majors season include Edna Kiplagat, the 2017 Boston Marathon champion and Sarah Chepchirchir the Tokyo Marathon Champion.&ldquo;Our list of women champions in athletics is long.
