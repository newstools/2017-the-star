Kitui governor aspirant David Musila has said he is shocked that people are printing T-shirts with his portrait and emblazoned  with the words “No Musila, No Nomination.” On Thursday, the senator recorded a statement with the police over the T-shirts, whose message insinuates there will be chaos in the Wiper primaries on Monday. Musila claims Governor Julius Malombe is behind the T-shirts saga. He urged police to thoroughly investigate. But Malombe also accused Musila’s team of printing T-shirts with his portrait to distribute them during the Wiper nominations to cause chaos. Speaking in Migwani on Thursday, Malombe said, “The aim is to disqualify me but their scheme will flop.” Musila said, “I have been in politics for many years and have never advocated violence and also as the party chairman, I should steer peaceful nominations. The governor is trying to portray me as violent.”
