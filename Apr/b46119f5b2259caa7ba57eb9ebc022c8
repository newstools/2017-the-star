Six voters have moved to court to challenge the IEBC's decision to directly procure poll equipment from French firm Safran Identity and Security.They want the court to stop the Kenya Integration Election Management System (KIEMS) tender on grounds that it was single sourced.The electoral agency acquired the equipment it expects to use in the management of August 8 poll results.The litigants include Wycliffe Lugwiri, Reuben Mulama, Hezron Ombati, Peter Mukoya, Grace Mugo and Hanna Mugo.Their position on the tender is that the electoral commission's decision on the procurement is arbitrary and oppressive.The group says that whereas IEBC justifies direct procurement on the basis of urgency and compatibility, the reasons given for single sourcing KIEMS are not convincing.According to the suit filed by the lot at the Milimani law court, the electoral body has acted unlawfully and illegally.This is after IEBC chair Wafula Chebukati announced in March that Safran Identity and Security (previously Morpho) had won the tender for the job.He further added that after cancellation, the only technically evaluated bidder quoted a price of Sh5.2 billion against the available budget of Sh3.8 billion.He also revealed that Safran had been supporting IEBC in preparing the final voter register being compiled through the biometric system.Read: IEBC settles for Safran for poll equipment, says deadlines must be metMore on this: IEBC cancels tender for poll equipment, seeks to lease
