It is September 2017, a month after the election, and by some stroke of luck, or an extreme rigging scheme, NASA has won the presidency.Days after being sworn in, President Raila Odinga calls a press conference with his boys &ndash; Kalonzo Musyoka, Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula, Musalia Mudavadi and now Isaac Rutto &ndash; in tow.Raila declares that sometime in April 2018 will be a holiday as Kenyans hold a referendum to create the position of Chief Minister, among others, to accommodate his boys in government.This is because only one of the four is an elected politician and currently serving as the Deputy President with the rest now being jobless and needing to be accommodated in government.Raila also reveals that the proposed referendum, aimed at creating these jobs for his boys, would cost the Kenyan taxpayer some Sh20 billion, or more, depending on how long the process would take.It then dawns on Kenyans that NASA&rsquo;s agenda, which was disguised as saving them from the &ldquo;failed&rdquo; Jubilee government, was purely a scheme to gain power and political self-gain.Things get even worse as we suffer for two years, and the already failed administration focusses on how to create enough centres of power to accommodate themselves rather than service delivery.As we wake up from this nightmare, we realise that our Constitution, which took two decades to put in place ,will be mutilated permanently by a NASA government.This means that with NASA&rsquo;s strategy, the country will not move forward for about two years after the election as we focus on amending the Constitution, and politicking. Two years of divisive politics, chaos and instability that would wreck the economy and cost us countless jobs.In those two years, the country will spend Sh20 billion or more to amend the Constitution. This same amount is what the Jubilee government has spent in the past two years to support the Youth Fund.Sh20 billion is half of what is spent supporting the entire agricultural sector. Sh20 billion would easily complete the Last Mile Connectivity programme to all Kenyan households.Further, Sh20 billion would fund Free Primary Education for 18 months and the same amount was enough to fund five years of free maternity care.With this realisation, it is clear that NASA is an outfit made up of three jobless individuals and two who are not sure of their political future, who are only interested in getting into government for political power and selfish gain.NASA has repeatedly said they will spoil the Wanjiku Constitution to give all co-principals senior positions in Parliament, including creating a role of Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister. They have even come up with a new one that they are calling Chief Minister and one wonders what this actually means.The delay in naming a flagbearer is due to the fact that the NASA boys cannot agree on how to share power. Theirs is not about what they can do to help the country transform, but how they can form a clique of power for themselves.It is even more ridiculous that in 2010 these opposition players backed the Constitution, which scrapped such additional roles. These roles were both a massive waste of taxpayer money and posed the danger of inefficiencies in decision-making as experienced in the nusu mkate government in which Raila was Prime Minister, Kalonzo was Vice President and Mudavadi was Deputy Prime Minister.The three have been jobless four years and now think that getting into power through the back door and mutilating the Constitution is the way to go.NASA&rsquo;s determination to reopen an issue that took decades to settle only to give themselves jobs is selfish, reckless, and it sacrifices the country&rsquo;s security and prosperity.
