The Central Bank of Kenya has issued a licence to DIB Bank Kenya, which is owned by Dubai Islamic Bank, signaling the end of a moratorium placed in November 2015.The announcement made yesterday will make DIB Kenya the third fully Shariah &ndash; compliant bank to be licensed in Kenya, after Gulf African Bank Limited in 2007 and First Community Bank Limited in 2008.This increases the number of banking institutions in the country to 43 ( 42 commercial banks and one mortgage financier.)CBK had suspended the licensing of new banks on November 17, 2015, saying it needed to strengthen oversight, weeks after two banks- Imperial and a Dubai Bank were placed under receivership.&ldquo;The licence has been granted under Sections 4 and 5 of the Banking Act after fulfillment of the stipulated requirements. DIB intends to exclusively offer Shariah compliant banking services in Kenya,&rdquo; CBK said in a statement.It will offer islamic banking services in the country, where Muslims account for about 10 per cent of the population of about 44 million.DIB Bank Kenya and Mayfair Bank, which is owned by Kenyan investors, had received an &ldquo;approval in principle&rdquo; before the indefinite suspension of new bank. On March 13, the regulator announced its intention to licence the two institutions.DIB is a fully owned subsidiary of Dubai Islamic Bank PJSC of the United Arab Emirates founded in 1975.As at September 2016, DIB PJSC had an asset base of $47.6 billion (about 4.855 trillion ) and capital of $7.4 billion (Sh754.8 billion). It has a presence in Bosnia, Indonesia, Pakistan, Sudan, Turkey and UAE.&ldquo;DIBs entry will expand the offerings in the market, particularly in the nascent shariah compliant banking niche,&rdquo; the Central Bank said. CBK said the choice of Kenya as DIB&rsquo;s entry point into Sub-Saharan Africa &ldquo;signals Kenya&rsquo;s growing stature as a premier regional financial services hub&rdquo;. It is expected to support the long-standing economic ties between Kenya and the UAE.The banking sector regulator is also expected to issue Mayfair Bank with a licence. The moratorium had stalled entry of international banks into the country, where in the last 17 months, commercial banks have come under closer scrutiny from the regulator because of rising bad debts.CBK governor Patrick Njoroge hinted on March 27, that nine more international banks are eyeing the Kenyan market.
