&ldquo;I will be on the ballot in August whether I win or lose.&rdquo; These were the words of Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko, hours after he cast his vote for the Jubilee governor ticket.Both Sonko and his main challenger Peter Kenneth complained of missing names, delays and confusion as one person was stabbed to death after supporters of parliamentary candidates clashed in Pangani.&ldquo;It is important to note that there are hiccups and I think the party should address them,&rdquo; Kenneth told journalists after casting his vote in Bahati Primary School.Kenneth complained that some people were allowed to vote though their names were missing in the registers, while others were denied the chance, yet their names were on the list.As polling stations opened yesterday, a youth was ran over at Pangani as he fled from a group that stabbed him when trying to mount campaign posters for a Starehe Parliamentary aspirant.Another person was injured in the fracas.Nairobi county commander Japheth Koome said the two were accosted by a group of youths allied to the politicians&rsquo; competitor at around 6am.At many polling centres, there was a standoff as voters were turned away because they were not in the party register. This raised questions among some aspirants.Sonko said the nominations were not fair, adding he had visited more than 100 polling centres in the city and many voters were being turned away because their names were not in the party&rsquo;s list.Kenneth called on the election officials to address the &lsquo;few irregularities&rsquo;.He claimed many voters at Bahati and Uhuru primary schools station for many years were turned away over missing names.&ldquo;In some centres, polling clerks have black books and are writing names of people whose names are not in the register,&rdquo; Kenneth said.Sonko, who is facing off with Keneth and Margaret Wanjiru, said he was frustrated and read mischief in the running of the nominations.&ldquo;I do not understand why some of my supporters have not been allowed to cast their votes,&rdquo; he said.After visiting the Bahati polling station, Sonko said that those whose names started with &lsquo;O&rsquo; were missing from the register.&ldquo;I have communicated to the party officials over the omitted names,&rdquo; he added.Some aspirants said the party ignored the list generated from the recent mass voter registration drive. Those who transferred their polling stations during the mass voter listing were referred back to their old stations.But in response, Jubilee Party Elections Board chairman Andrew Musangi said they had opted to use the party register as the only means of identification for voters in Nairobi to avoid infiltration of the exercise.&ldquo;Our aim was not to deny any voter the chance to vote and we even resorted to ultimately checking their identification of the voter with a view to seeing what location they come from and thereafter allowing them to vote,&rdquo; he said.Musangi added, &ldquo;However, credible intelligence has emerged and we were constantly monitoring this even yesterday, that there were particularly concerted efforts to infiltrate the Jubilee Party voting in Nairobi.&rdquo;Elsewhere, he said party supporters were allowed to cast their vote despite their names missing in the register, as long as they had national ID cards.Sonko raised an alarm over missing names of his supporters in the Jubilee party register.He said he will run as an independent candidate if he fails to clinch the Jubilee ticket. &ldquo;Even if they rig me out of the primaries, I will still be on the ballot on August 8,&rdquo; Sonko said. Earlier, Mutindwa market was reportedly closed by the senator&rsquo;s henchmen, who directed all traders to go and vote for him.Nairobi residents were seen on the queues in many polling stations as early as 4am.The Jubilee Party allowed anyone with an identification card to vote.There had been speculation that Kenneth was going to step down for Sonko.But Peter Kenneth last week said he is not aware of any talks for him step down.He said he was going to be on the ballot and that he was expecting free and fair nominations. &ldquo;I am not aware of talks happening that would lead to a consensus,&rdquo; Kenneth said.
