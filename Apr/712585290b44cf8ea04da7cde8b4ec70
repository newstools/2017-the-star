City Hall has finally found an investor to set up a Sh27 billion power plant at the overflowing Dandora dumpsite and manage garbage in the &ldquo;dirty city&rdquo;.The initial German investor, Sustainable Environment Management UG, withdrew last year.&ldquo;We already have a contractor who will build a Sh27 billion plant to recycle the waste and produce electricity,&rdquo; Kidero said on Saturday at the Railways Club.Without naming the investor, Kidero said the county has signed a 15-year contract to set up a plant to sort out and recycle the waste.Construction is to start in the next financial year.The plant will produce 40MW daily.The dumpsite was full more than 20 years ago. The county now compacts waste to expand capacity by five years.Kidero said the plant will eliminate the need to relocate the dumpsite by investing in renewable energy.The Auditor General reported the German firm withdrew because the county lacked a title deed for the land.But Kidero said the firm could not raise the required Sh28 billion.Lands executive Christopher Khaemba told the Star last year the county did not have title but could acquire one if there was a serious investor.Attempts to relocate the dumpsite to Ruai failed after the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority said it would attract birds and pose a danger of bird hits. That would endanger flights at JKIA.Speaking of the garbage menace, Kidero said his administration has managed the trash and blamed opponents for lying that the capital is wallowing in garbage.&ldquo;When we came in, only 300 tonnes of garbage was being collected. Now we are collecting 2,400 tonnes per day,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When we came, there were only 15 lorries, now we have over 100 and 15 contractors. Somebody just needs to go to Dandora and see.&rdquo;
