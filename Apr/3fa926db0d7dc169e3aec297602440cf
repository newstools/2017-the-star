Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero has taken his re-election campaigns a notch higher by visiting Nairobi West prison where he asked inmates to vote wisely in the coming elections.Kidero said his office is open to the inmates who may require his services as the Governor of the City."You have a say on how this country will be run. That is why the Constitution allows you to vote on August 8. Vote with wisdom. Vote leaders who will bring change," Kidero said."Before you leave the prison, I'm organising so that you can visit me at City Hall in case you need my help," he said.Kidero urged the prisoners to embrace change and good social behaviour in and outside the confines of the prison and once released, to be agents of good morals in the society "I urge you to be ambassadors of change in the society once you are released. I know you are counting days before you are set free. Ensure that you are the change you want in our society," he said.Early in the year, IEBC said prisoners will be allowed to take part in the general elections but will only cast the ballot for the position of President.Read:&nbsp;Inmates have voting rights, judge rulesKenyan prisoners won the right to vote in a 2010 landmark ruling by the High Court; they have however not voted due to logistical issues concerning the registration and the eventual process. &nbsp;&nbsp; Read;&nbsp; There are about 50 000 inmates in Kenya&rsquo;s 118 prisons.In January, IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati said the commission will create the registration centres based on the data to be received from the State Department for Correctional Services."The commission reckoned that there would need to develop regulations to govern the participation of prisoners in elections," Chebukati said.
