Nyali MP Hezron Awiti on Saturday set aside his criticism of Governor Hassan Joho, publicly empathised and said his political woes will soon end.He said there&rsquo;s no bad blood between them.The friendly words from Joho&rsquo;s harsh critic set tongues wagging.&ldquo;Sorry for your troubles. All these will end. Where you are from is not important. Where you are going is,&rdquo; Wiper&rsquo;s former national treasurer said.Awiti was referring to questions about Joho&rsquo;s academic papers, KRA queries and frozen bank accounts.Awiti&rsquo;s empathy sparked rumours of a possible pact between the two, a claim dismissed by Awiti&rsquo;s camp.Awiti wants to defeat Joho, the ODM deputy party leader, through his newly formed Vibrant Democratic PartyHe spoke after Joho unveiled a Sh1.5 million replica of the iconic mamba statue, destroyed in April last year in road expansion. &ldquo;We are mature in politics. What mzee said does not mean he will shelve his plans. He is strongly in the race,&rdquo; an Awiti ally said.Analysts said Awiti&rsquo;s speech could be the beginning of a different relationship between them. &ldquo;Awiti&rsquo;s reconciliatory words could mean different things,&rdquo; Philip Kaulu of Technical University of Mombasa told the Star yesterday.On interpretation could be the two businessmen-cum-politicians have been friends behind the scenes or even business associates, he said.&ldquo;The third, unlikely event, could be they might work together after Awiti felt betrayed by Wiper,&rdquo; Kaulu said.Joho said politics will come and go but people will remain. The two said they will partner in development to ensure Mombasa prospers, especially in the tourism and business sectors.Joho said because ODM is a bigger, stronger and older party, he will guide Awiti in his new party. He called Awiti a &ldquo;son of ODM&rdquo;.
