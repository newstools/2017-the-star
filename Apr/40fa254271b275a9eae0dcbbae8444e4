Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho has warned his rivals to prepare for a resounding defeat on August 8.He said his rivals have chosen to end their political careers by running against him.&ldquo;They&rsquo;re committing political suicide because after August 8, they&rsquo;ll be jobless,&rdquo; Joho (pictured) said.Three hopefuls &mdash; Nyali MP Hezron Awiti (Vibrant Democratic Party), Senator Hassan Omar (Wiper) and businessman Suleiman Shahbal of Jubilee &mdash; want to wrest the seat from him.Omar, a friend-turned-foe, on Thursday told journalists that Joho has failed and does not deserve another term in office.He said when NASA takes over power, it will investigate allegations over Joho&rsquo;s forged certificate and jail him if he is found culpable.&ldquo;I can assure you, after NASA takes over, this forgery will be one of the first matters that will go before our criminal jurisdiction. We can&rsquo;t condone this type of thing,&rdquo; Omar said.However, Joho, in an indirect reference to Omar, said there are individuals who pretend to know it all, but cannot provide any meaningful leadership. &ldquo;When you look closely, the person who undermines your capability and thinks you are dumb is the dumbest,&rdquo; Joho said. He was speaking to more than 500 youths at his Prima Binns office. The county boss awarded them driving licences. Their training was funded by the Mombasa county government. Joho said efforts to block him from running in 2007 and 2013 failed and this year will be no different.
