Siaya county needs a servant leader who will rescue it from poverty and poor healthcare, governor aspirant Carey Orege has said. He said residents have faced acute water shortage and poor medical services since the inception of the county government, despite huge revenue allocations every financial year. The former Regional Development PS was speaking during the launch of his campaigns on Monday in Bondo town. Governor Cornel Rasanga (pictured) has blamed the Siaya Water Board for the scarcity. Orege said if elected he will ensure equal distribution of public resources and jobs. He condemned the recent heckling of Rasanga in Bondo in the presence of ODM party leader Raila Odinga.
