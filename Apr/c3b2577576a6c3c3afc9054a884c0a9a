Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka has maintained he is in NASA to stay and expressed optimism that the alliance will win the August 8 poll because of the principals&rsquo; unity.He was on a two-day vote-hunt tour of Kwale, where he said their calculations have revealed they have more votes than Jubilee.&ldquo;Now that we have Musalia Mudavadi&rsquo;s votes, we are guaranteed of winning,&rdquo; Kalonzo said on Saturday.The NASA co-principal said unlike 2013, no dead people will vote this time round.&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s remain in NASA even if it means stepping on each other from within. I&rsquo;m not the diplomatic Kalonzo people knew before. We better remain stupid but save this country from misrule,&rdquo; he said.Kalonzo welcomed a court decision that makes final the presidential results announced at the constituency, saying it will prevent rigging.He reiterated that NASA will have a parallel voter tallying centre and criticised Jubilee for opposing it, saying it is not meant to cause violence but ensure the credibility of the poll results.&ldquo;Jubilee is using NYS money to bribe citizens to vote for it, but it won&rsquo;t make it,&rdquo; Kalonzo said, adding that there is no way JP can win a free and fair election. He urged JP to prepare to go home early.Kalonzo criticised the Jubilee administration for failing to address insecurity and instead branding Muslims al Shabaab. He blamed it for the dwindling tourism sector.Kalonzo said NASA is not worried about Jubilee&rsquo;s plan to use the state machine to deal with its critics like it did when they demanded former IEBC commissioners quit office.He said a NASA administration will protect youths from the Coast by stopping illegal arrests on the pretext of fighting terror. This will end the forced disappearances witnessed under the Jubilee administration, Kalonzo added.&ldquo;No more Coast people will join MRC as they will feel part of the government,&rdquo; he said.Wiper deputy leader and Lamu county woman representative Shakila Abdalla dismissed President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s State of the Nation address. She said Uhuru proposed reduction of salaries of public officers, yet his administration is the main cause of a blotted wage bill, citing parallel devolved functions by the provincial administration.Secretary general Hassan Omar said the party is in NASA and Kalonzo will fight it out with other principals for the alliance ticket.&ldquo;If he gets the chance he will &lsquo;NASA&rsquo; UhuRuto and if he misses out he will support the winner,&rdquo; he said.Wiper Kwale governor aspirant Chirau Mwakwere criticised Uhuru and DP William Ruto for supporting his rival Governor Salim Mvurya, calling them landgrabbers.
