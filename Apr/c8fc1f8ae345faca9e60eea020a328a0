GSU coach Tarus said the win against their rivals Prisons is a sign of better things to come.He said: &ldquo; Of course the win against Prisons is something. Last season, we surrendered the title to them but this time around, we are keen to reclaim the trophy. I&rsquo;m building a young team that will be out to command the league for the next three years.&rdquo;His opposite number Gideon Chenje,who had guided his team to win their earlier clash against Forest Rangers 3-1(25-11,25-17,20-25,25-19), said there shouldn&rsquo;t be any cause of alarm.&ldquo;We are fresh from playing indoor during the Africa Club Championship in Tunisia and playing outdoor here in Ndakaini was bound to impact on us negatively. However, we are determined to make amends,&rdquo; said Chenje.
