A report tabled before the Elgeyo Marakwet assembly by Kaptarakwa MCA Thomas Kigen has revealed mismanagement in the health department. It indicates a bloated wage bill, about 42 per cent of the recurrent expenditure. This was attributed to irregular hiring of 90 employees since 2014 . The report was commissioned in 2015 to check the rising wage bill.
