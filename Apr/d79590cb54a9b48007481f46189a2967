A Chinese company that has been harvesting crayfish in Lake Naivasha has been forced to relocate after the stocks ran out. The investors now buy the fish from dams in Kinangop, Nyandarua county, after it emerged the lake could not sustain crayfish production. This comes a week after hundreds of other fish types were found dead offshore, south of the lake. The cause had yet to be established but investigations have been ongoing. County director of Fisheries Mathew Ngila said crayfish production is seasonal, hence the investor had to seek an alternative source. He said research has indicated that the infamous Common carp was feeding on the crayfish and attributed this to the drop in the catch. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve seen an increase in the production and size of Common carp species but recorded a sharp drop in crayfish catch,&rdquo; Ngila said.
