Migori Governor Okoth Obado has denied allegations that he sparked the violence during which Hassan Joho's bodyguard was shot and injured.The Governor said he did not plan or engage in any form of violence at Migori's Posta grounds on April 3."That was the work of my opponents. His supporters started throwing stones at us as soon as we arrived," Obado said. One of the Mombasa county chief's bodyguards was shot in chaos that reportedly resulted from claims he was there to endorse some politicians. It was said that Joho was&nbsp;to endorse Suna East MP Junet Mohamed and former Rongo MP Ochillo Ayacko, who is a governor aspirant.

"The party leader or any official is free to visit the county as long as they don't come to endorse some people," said the Governor who was elected on a PDP ticket."I am an ODM member. I am here to stay because this is my number one party."Obado was among leaders who appeared before the ODM disciplinary committee on Monday following summonses.Governors Sospeter Ojaamong (Busia), Ruaraka MP Tom Kajwang' and Elizabeth Ongoro (Nominated) also faced the committee.Read: Joho, Obado, Ongoro among 14 summoned by ODM over violenceOngoro, who was the first to face the committee led by Fred Athuok at Mash Park hotel, said she was a victim of campaign violence."Attacking party officials is unacceptable.

It is my opponent who is fond of causing chaos," he said after the session."I have brought a lot of video and photographic evidence capturing youths pelting stones as others roughed up people."The Governor said he was not aware that somebody died in the altercation that ensued at the meeting."I have not been informed about the death but if it is true, it is regrettable," he added.Athuok said nominations must be conducted in a peaceful environment and that those who breed violence will be suspended, fined or removed."We will not hesitate to deal with candidates who cause chaos at other competitor's meeting," Athuok said.
