Socialite Huddah Monroe may have let the cat out of the bag and revealed whom she may have spent her precious time with while in Miami. This is not the first time the socialite has been linked to a famous personality. A while back, she admitted on Kiss FM that she had a thing with a famous footballer whom we finally found out was Senegalese international footballer Diafra Sakho. At the time, she seemed to be besotted with the footballer. They followed each other on Instagram. Moving on, Huddah was in Miami, where she went to get a boob job as well as meet some of her people. From the photos she was posting online, one can tell she was living in a swanky and super expensive condo that overlooked the beach. The socialite hinted that she may have fallen hard for an American star to a point where she was considering staying on in Miami to spend more time with him.&ldquo;These US rapper tho! You can fall in love and get your heart broken into pieces. I almost overstayed my stay in Miami but that is a story for another day guys,&rdquo; Huddah wrote on her Instastory.The only American rapper that Huddah Monroe is following and is following her back is Ciara&rsquo;s baby daddy, Future. Question, were they hanging out together in Miami?
