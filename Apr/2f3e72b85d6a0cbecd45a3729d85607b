Meru and Tharaka Nithi politicians have been warned against using the border dispute to incite residents of the two counties against each other as the election draws closer.Lawyer Gitobu Imanyara said politicians from both counties should not take advantage of the row to gain political mileage.He spoke on Sunday at Kauthene Primary School in Central Imenti constituency. The area borders Tharaka constituency. Imanyara made a political comeback on March 20. He had retired from politics five years ago after losing his bid for Meru senator to incumbent Kiraitu Murungi in 2013. &ldquo;I had retired from politics, but I was called by the elders and residents who told me matters were not being handled well. The development projects I started stalled. They asked me to make a comeback,&rdquo; he said after meeting 100 elders in March. Many politicians have promised to settle the border dispute if elected.Imanyara said the Constitution outlines clear mechanisms for resolving border disputes. He said elders have firsthand information on the correct boundaries and should be consulted first.&ldquo;Residents and leaders can also use alternative dispute resolution methods, including the Njuri Ncheke Council of Elders, to resolve border disputes instead of resorting to incitement and violence,&rdquo; Imanyara said.The long-time ally of ODM leader Raila Odinga ditched the party last month. Imanyara said he will run for Central Imenti MP on the Maendeleo Chap Chap ticket.He was endorsed by the Njuri Ncheke elders at his Mariene home.Imanyara said, &ldquo;In the 2013 poll, I vied for senator on an ODM ticket but this time round the elders have told me to vie under Maendeleo Chap Chap.&rdquo;He continued, &ldquo;Its leaders have shown good leadership by campaigning peacefully.&rdquo;
