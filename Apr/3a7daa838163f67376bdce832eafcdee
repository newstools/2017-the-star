Deputy President William Ruto on Saturday intensified his onslaught against Bomet governor Isaac Rutto.The DP told Bomet residents to vote him out of office in the upcoming polls, on grounds that he was not keen on developing the county. &ldquo;Come August 8th, Rutto must go home. We cannot have such a person who is always a stumbling block being a leader anymore.&rdquo; Ruto said. This was the third time Ruto visited the county this year. Ruto also accused opposition leaders of faulting the government of their failures without giving them solutions to the concerns they were raising. He said most of the leaders in the National Super Alliance party committed the country to borrowing loans to pay fictitious mega projects in the name Goldenberg and was only interested in criticizing the Jubilee Party to cover up their political misfortunes.&ldquo;We want politics of issues so that people will decide for themselves whom they want to vote for not politics that divides us on the basis of a language that we speak and tribe,&rdquo; he said. Elgeyo Marakwet senator Kipchumba Murkomen also accused the governor Rutto of misusing county funds to popularizing his Chama Cha Mashinani party.National assembly leader Aden Duale shared similar sentiments with Murkomen. &ldquo;Your governor here is associating himself with leaders in NASA who have looted myriad of public coffers and want to protect them by heaping blame on the deputy president,"Duale said. Governors Moses Lenokula (Samburu), Samuel Tunai (Narok), Paul Chepkwony (Kericho), Salim Mvurya (Kwale) and National assembly majority leader Adan Duale attended the rally.Several senators and cabinet secretaries also attended the rally.
