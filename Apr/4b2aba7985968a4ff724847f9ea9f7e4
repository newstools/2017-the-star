They were pastoralists but abandoned that way of life after losing almost all their livestock to drought. &ldquo;We were caught unawares by the heavy rains that started on Saturday evening. We were shocked to find our farms submerged in flood waters this morning. We could not even salvage our farming tools,&rdquo; he said.
