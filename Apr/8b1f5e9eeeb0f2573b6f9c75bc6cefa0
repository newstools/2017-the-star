Council of Governors chairperson Peter Munya yesterday said the recurring breakdown of Ifmis could be a plot by the national government to slow down operations in the counties.The system failed last week, grinding county operations to a halt. The system also failed in December last year.Speaking in Nairobi, Munya said it is suspect the system was working at the national level but not in the counties.He was accompanied by his Makueni counterpart Kivutha Kibwana. Munya said, &ldquo;These systems could have been intentionally slowed down to make the county governments appear not to be performing their duties and when the end of the year comes, they start making propaganda that we have not been working.&rdquo;Kibwana said, &ldquo;We have not paid suppliers and this is hitting us hard because they will soon down their tools demanding payment.&rdquo;The CoG said it will challenge the intended amendment to the Election Laws Act, currently at the National Assembly.The CoG particularly highlighted a bone of contention in the amendment proposal to bar election contestants from challenging election results more than once. Munya said the amendments violated the Constitution.&ldquo;We do not know what the National Assembly&rsquo;s intentions are, but we will not support it. It is denying those seeking elective posts the right to justice,&rdquo; he said.Munya said the Chief Justice is misguiding the National Assembly by advising legislators to adopt it.&ldquo;I understand Chief Justice David Maraga advised the National Assembly to pass the bill, but I want to tell you it is wrong, and we are going to challenge it in court if the National Assembly tries to pass it,&rdquo; he said.The bill is currently in its second reading.The CoG said it is opposed to the recently assented Appropriations Law.Munya accused President Uhuru Kenyatta of assenting to the bill despite ongoing talks between the counties and the national government.&ldquo;We support senators as they challenge this law because it was passed prematurely,&rdquo; he said.
