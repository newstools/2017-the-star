The four NASA principals discussed strategies for beating Jubilee but did not name a flag bearer at their Sunday meeting in Kilifi.Wiper boss Kalonzo Musyoka said the strategies were the primary agenda of the meeting held at Vipingo Ridge.His meeting with Raila Odinga (ODM), Musalia Mudavadi (Amani) and Moses Wetang'ula (Ford Kenya) went late into the night.Kalonzo said they agreed to form polling station committees all over the country.He said the teams will not conduct parallel tallying but will tabulate the results as announced at constituency polling centres."The committee will relay the results announced by IEBC to the coalition's central tallying centre," he said. "This will make it difficult to change the results after the final figures are released."Raila earlier said that each of the 45,000 polling stations will be manned by a team of 50 committee members.But Kalonzo said each polling station's committee will have five member who will ensure rigging is prevented."The committee members, through their chair, shall have direct contact with the NASA principals," he told supporters on Monday after opening a Wiper office at Majengo Kanamae."We want to win in one touch. We do not want to see any kind of rigging in the country."Read: IEBC erred by allowing NASA to have parallel tallying centre &mdash; JPThe co-principals are still in a push and pull over who is best suited to vie against President Uhuru Kenyatta.Uhuru and Deputy President William Ruto are seeking a second term in office through Jubilee Party.Kalonzo said Jubilee will be removed from power no matter who is flag bearer.But he added that should he fly the flag, Uhuru and Ruto will go home by midday on August 8.He was accompanied by Wiper leaders including Mombasa Senator Hassan Omar who is the party's secretary general.Read: NASA will win, Jubilee can&rsquo;t beat us in free and fair poll &mdash; Kalonzo
