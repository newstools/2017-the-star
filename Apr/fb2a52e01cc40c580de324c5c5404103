Colonel Mustapha could be in big trouble after he hinted at a 'liaison' with rapper Prezzo's ex-girl, Michelle Yola. The two have been spending time together in a manner that suggests the two are more than friends. This comes after Yola broke up with the controversial singer Prezzo over his repeated incidences of 'infidelity'. Mustapha, who is in the same TV reality show together with Yola, told Word Is that they have shot a scene together on Nairobi Diaries, which is yet to be aired."Yes, we have a scene together and it will be interesting to watch," Moustapha bragged. Mustapha seems to be getting into Prezzo's territory after he was hanging out and having a jolly 'ol good time with Yola.It will be remembered that during an interview with Larry Madowo, Prezzo threatened to shoot any man that was going to try and date Yola after they had a very public break-up.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m damn sure it is not the last time [we have broken up]. She is still in my heart, so it is all good, I wouldn't really say she is my ex...yet!&rdquo;He added: "We are trying to patch things up. She is still my wife, up until I see her with another goon, then I'm going to catch a case and then, I have a money hungry lawyer who is going to take the case."Called for comment, Colonel Mustapha, who has just released his latest single Ayo, said he is never scared. he rubbished the veiled threats Prezzo made, saying, "He can shoot if he so pleases. But not Mustapha."
