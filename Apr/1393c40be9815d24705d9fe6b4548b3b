TITLETaken STARRING Clive Standen, Gaius Charles, Brooklyn Sudano, Jennifer BealsGENREActionRelease Date February 27The culture of big screen to small screen adaptations has seen the remake of major blockbusters into weekly shows. The problem with these adaptations is that sometimes they don&rsquo;t live up to the magnitude of the film. Such is the case of Taken. The show concentrates on the life of a young Bryan Mills, who fails to save his sister in an orchestrated shootout and then sets out to avenge her death. The problem is, the show is much focused on revenge than retrieving something that was taken away, as the name suggests. Other than that irony in the plotline, the production value and performance just manage to save the show from being a total disaster. Star Rating: 2.5/5
