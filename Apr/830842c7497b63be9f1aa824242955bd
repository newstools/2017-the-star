Mandera Governor Ali Roba on Saturday took a swipe at a section of leaders from the area who formed their own party.Speaking during a Jubilee rally in Nairobi to connect with people from Mandera, Roba said, &ldquo;Our would-be opponents chickened out for no other reason but because they knew very well they could not beat us in the nominations. They know we have the numbers and will easily win.&rdquo;Mandera Senator Billow Kerrow and governor aspirant Hassan Noor formed the Economic Freedom Party last week with the backing of the Garre Council of Elders.Kerrow said the elders&rsquo; choice is the people&rsquo;s choice and members should be given direct nomination.Roba criticised the elders for telling him not to seek reelection.&ldquo;If you start saying this person has got his share so let us this time round give it to another, then who will be left for the population to choose from? It should not be about an individual,&rdquo; he said. Roba added, &ldquo;My team has decided to call itself Team Justice. This is because we view the position taken by the 21 members of the Garre Council of Elders as extremely unjustified.&rdquo;He said the political outfit formed by rivals will not threaten Jubilee&rsquo;s popularity because &ldquo;the people of Mandera are fully behind President Uhuru Kenyatta.&rdquo;During the launch of the party, Kerrow was noncommittal on which coalition it will support. Roba said anyone who tries to sell a party other than Jubilee in the region is daydreaming.Mandera West MP Mohamud Mohamed, who will run for senator, said the people have the last say on who should lead them.
