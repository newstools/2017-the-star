Siaya governor hopeful Carey Orege has urged residents to vote for him as his campaign has been peaceful and based on issues that matter to them. “My opponents are tirelessly locking horns over non-issues like who
should be heckled, when one should be heckled and where to be heckled,
all aimed at setting fertile ground for chaos during nominations and not
development,” he said. Orege spoke in Bondo on Tuesday. He will battle it out with Governor Cornel Rasanga, Rarieda MP
Nicholas Gumbo and businessman William Oduol for the ODM ticket on April
24. “I stand for development just like my previous track record as the
former PS for regional development speaks for itself,” Orege said.
