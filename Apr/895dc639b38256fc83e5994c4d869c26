Some Kiambu young people who registered to vote early this year and late last year might not be able to cast ballots on August 8 as their names are missing from the IEBC register.The missing names led youths to burn ballot papers in polling centres in Nyamweru, Gitithia, Gathaiti, Kirenga and Kibagare primary schools on Friday. That&rsquo;s when JP botched nominations in 21 counties were cancelled.The youths want the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission to allow them to scrutinise the list and check their eligibility to vote.The register is being audited and will be made public so that citizens can make corrections.Young people said their names did not appear on any register and they were turned away.Speaking on Saturday at Nyamweru Primary School in Lari, Patrick Muchuni said young people will not bother with voter registration if they are not allowed to participate in polls.Confirm names in IEBC poll list&ldquo;It is so discouraging when we have engaged aspirants and we cannot participate in the exercise of choosing the best candidate for the party because our details are missing from the IEBC register,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;What surety do we have the IEBC will avail the new register and we confirm our names are there? Our people will decide for us who votes. In return, we might not to take part in elections.&rdquo;On the same day at Kimende Posta and Kagwe Township Primary School, police fired in the air to disperse crowds angry over lack of preparation, and incorrect voter&rsquo;s lists.Kirenga MCA aspirant Joseph Karichu has asked IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati to reveal plans for the newly registered voters to check their details.&ldquo;It is so painful to lose votes we have sought. It is also discouraging to lock out our young people from voting for their candidates. The IEBC should listen to young people and allow them to scrutinise their details in their register,&rdquo; Karichu said.Area MP Mburu Kahangara has asked the party and the IEBC to reshuffle presiding officers from stations where they worked on Friday. &ldquo;There are those working at their village stations and interacting casually with voters. At that time they could compromise voters or mislead them not to vote for their preferred candidates,&rdquo; he said.Lari MP aspirants Ngige Kiguru and Jonah Mburu have asked the government to improve security in all polling centres to avoid rigging and bribing of voters.
