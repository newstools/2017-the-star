Vihiga county ODM coordinator George Muyera has said a Bunyore delegation that visited State House last Wednesday has no apologies to make for doing so.Muyera, who was part of the delegation, said the group honoured an invite from President Uhuru Kenyatta who wanted to meet community leaders ahead of his planned visit of Vihiga next week. The delegation was led by Caleb Ingolo. Muyera dismissed claims he defected to Jubilee during the visit. Vihiga is the home county of ANC leader and NASA founder Musalia Mudavadi. Ingolo said, &ldquo;If the President wants to meet stakeholders from Bunyore to discuss development and I am included, it does not mean I am defecting to Jubilee. We have decided to work with Jubilee for development.&rdquo;State House spokesman Manoah Esipisu is from Bunyore. Muyera said the delegation discussed the tarmacking of the Ekwanda-Luanda-Emusire-Esirulo road, launching of a granite factory, water projects and street lighting. &ldquo;The president decided to deal with the people directly because local leaders have been dodging him every time he plans to visit the area, pretending to be traveling abroad,&rdquo; he said. A group of Vihiga MCAs, led by ODM nominated ward rep Reuben Ombima said the visit was a waste of time because &ldquo;Vihiga voters support NASA.&rdquo;
