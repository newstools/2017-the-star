NASA principal Raila Odinga is preparing his supporters to cause chaos after the August 8 election through the planned parallel tallying centre for NASA, an MP has said.Lari legislator Mburu Kahangara on Tuesday urged the government not to be complacent because NASA leaders are convincing their supporters that they will win.He alleged that the opposition is planning to rig the presidential results and announce their leader as the winner.Kahangara said the law allows parties to have agents in polling centres but not to announce the results, saying that is the mandate of the IEBC.He said the IEBC is the only recognised arbitrator in elections and NASA leaders must accept that.&ldquo;The opposition could incite their supporters to cause chaos if they announced their leader has won, while the IEBC is announcing someone else,&rdquo; he said.Kahangara spoke at Gitithia Primary School, where he opened classrooms refurbished with CDF cash. He told NASA leaders to respect the Constitution, adding that they should have faith in the new IEBC commissioners.
