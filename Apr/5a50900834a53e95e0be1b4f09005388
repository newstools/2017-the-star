A case in which a former UNHCR employee is challenging allegations by Sidian Bank Ltd that she used the title deed to her 100-acre land valued at Sh550 million to obtain a Sh50 million loan has been transferred to the Kajiado county court.The case had been filed at the Milimani High Court registry, but has been transferred because the land is allocated in Kajiado.In the case, L A Owalo is asking the court to salvage her 100-acre farm, whose title was forged to secure a Sh50million loan from Sidian Bank.David Nyandoro Nyambaso, the principal Lands registrar in Kajiado county, has exonerated her.In his court documents, the registrar said Owalo&rsquo;s title deed was free of any encumberences.Nyambaso said the title used to secure the loan was forged. &ldquo;The title deed and charge documents presented by the bank in court alleging to belong to Owalo are forged,&rdquo; he said.The bank alleges it advanced a loan to Zenith Pharmaceuticals Ltd, whose directors are Gregory Muinde and Janet Nzomo. It is alleged Owalo, Muinde and Nzomo signed for the loan. But Owalo said she did not know about any loan. She also said she has never sold her land or used her title to gurantee anybody or company to secure a loan. Owalo said she bought the land from Moses Sitati in 2006. The sale was witnessed by lawyer Dorcus Ayoma.Nyambaso said when the title was registered, all registries countrywide had been closed for audit on orders of then Lands CS Charity Ngilu. He said the move by the bank to sell Owalo&rsquo;s land &ldquo;is in bad faith, frivolous and vexatious in nature and ought to be dismissed&rdquo;.The registrar said that on October 22, 2015, Owalo visited his office and raised a complaint the green card to the land was missing and she had learnt her land had been used to secure a loan.
