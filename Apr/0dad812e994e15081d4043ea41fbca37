Meru Senator Kiraitu Murungi's dissolution of Alliance Party of Kenya for the Jubilee merger was a "great political blunder", Gitobu Imanyara has said.The former Central Imenti MP told Kiraitu it is time to call it a day in politics as even his age is a "disadvantage" in the bid to succeed Governor Peter Munya."Kiraitu convinced Meru that they need to have an identity party to be able to improve their bargaining power nationally," he said.He said the people trusted the 'mbus' as their own brand and felt betrayed by the dissolution of the party.More on this: Kiraitu 'misled' Uhuru on Jubilee merger, should resign - MP MwitiImanyara said the problems the Senator is facing are related to the dissolution of the party. He noted Munya is promising the people that he will guard their interests by ensuring they have their own party - PNU."Many Merus are asking where Kiraitu was taking them after dissolving the party he formed after only four years. I foresee Munya trouncing him because of that," he said. "Merus no longer trust him because he is greedy for power. He breached the Ameru MoU agreed on by Meru leaders...that the senator seat remain in the Imenti sub-tribe for 10 years and that governors remain in Tigania for the same duration. This was witnessed by Njuri Nceke elders."He spoke at Kithaku in Central Imenti on Monday where he held a campaign rally.Imanyara said the Infortrak poll that placed Munya ahead of Murungi was a true reflection the situation on the ground.Infotrak reported that the Council of Governors chairman would get 41.4 per cent votes while Murungi would get 29 per cent.More on this: Munya likely to win Meru race, Kiraitu trailing as governor and senator - InfotrakMunya was unanimously elected PNU leader in October last year. He has dismissed calls to dissolve the party saying it is a scheme by Kiraitu to prevent him from getting the Jubilee ticket in 2017.The Governor has been at loggerheads with one-time ally Kiraitu, who is Alliance Party of Kenya leader, over supporting the folding up of APK to join the Jubilee party. Imanyara, who is seeking to recapture the Central Imenti seat on a Maendeleo Chap Chap ticket, defended party governor aspirant Kilemi Mwiria against accusations that he is someone's project in the race.Kilemi recently ditched Jubilee for Maendeleo Chap Chap. Imanyara said he is a victim of political propaganda.More on this: Gitobu makes a political comeback, to run for MPAlso read: Gitobu Imanyara ditches ODM for Maendeleo Chap ChapSpeaking separately at Kiirua Buuri constituency, Buuri MP Boniface Gatobu said Kiraitu is selfish and greedy.Gatobu said it was questionable that the Senator campaigned for Munya in 2013 but is now against him.He said Kiraitu should retire and give young leaders like him the chance to lead.Gatobu, who is the youngest legislator, joined the Meru governor race as an independent candidate.
