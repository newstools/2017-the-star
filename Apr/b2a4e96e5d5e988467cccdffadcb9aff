Macadamia farmers in Tetu, Nyeri county, have installed alarms on their trees to curb theft of the macadamia seeds.Mt Kenya Macadamia Association members have set the alarm in such a way that it goes off once the thieves hit the seeds.&ldquo;This came after farmers counted losses of the seeds which are their main cash crop in the area after dwindling coffee prices,&rdquo; association spokesman Peter Mwathi said.&ldquo;The alarm is meant to send [signals] to the owner through his mobile phone or through a siren at home.&rdquo;He said there are rampant cases of macadamia seed theft.Mwathi said the farmers have come up with a trap for rodents which climb up the tree and eat the seeds.The trees are surrounded with electric wires, which electrocute the destructive rodents.Mwathi said the group of 50 members has invented a dehusker.&ldquo;These dehuskers are made by the association members using local materials. One just needs some cement, metal bars and a plastic bucket. This method, though manual, saves on energy and time,&rdquo; he said.The farmers no longer use the traditional way of beating macadamia in a sack to dehusk them.Member Jackson Wangenye, a farmer at Gichira, said the innovations have increased their incomes since they no longer lose their nuts to rodents and thieves.The farmers have started a project to sell macadamia tree seedlings for Sh200 each.The association sells the dehuskers for Sh5,500.
