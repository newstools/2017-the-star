Wiper Party has postponed the Machakos governor nominations set for Tuesday and has summoned all aspirants for an urgent meeting."We are aware that people have been mobilised to interfere with the outcome of the nominations in Machakos," secretary general Hassan Omar said in a statement on Monday.Omar accused incumbent Governor Alfred Mutua of wanting to tamper with the outcome of the nominations."It is well known that there is a direct interest by one of the Jubilee affiliates, that is, Maendeleo Chap Chap through Governor Mutua," he said.But he said elections for all other positions will go on.Omar said the party's Machakos governor aspirants &ndash; Wavinya Ndeti, Bernard Kiala and Peter Mathuki &ndash; will meet on Tuesday to agree on the way forward." ... so that we agree on the way forward by either reorganising that process for April 26 before the close of the nominations, or find another practical way," he said.Omar apologised for the inconvenience but assured that nominations will be free and fair.Earlier, Machakos governor aspirant Wavinya Ndeti asked Wiper leadership to honour the deal that she gets direct ticket in the race.The former Chama Cha Uzalendo leader said the Wiper NEC had ordered party leader Kalonzo Musyoka to nominate her."It is unfair to expose me to nominations because in the event that I lose, I shall have lost twice," Ndeti said during a Sunday rally.Ndeti, who wants to unseat Governor Alfred Mutua, said the party's NEC had settled that she faces off with the incumbent on August 8.Read: Wavinya Ndeti joins Wiper, Kalonzo says Machakos likely to get woman governor
