Lack of investments in rainwater storage is partly to blame for the food insecurity Kenya is facing, Water CS Eugene Wamalwa has said.Speaking during the launch of the Billion Dollar Business Alliance for Rainwater Harvesting, Wamalwa said the country receives enough rainfall, but there are no proper plans on how to harvest rainwater.&ldquo;There are possible options to fight the twin challenge of frequent droughts and floods. Rainwater harvesting and management is indeed achievable. Let&rsquo;s work towards sustaining this campaign,&rdquo; he said.The CS (pictured) said his ministry will focus on developing water resources, water reclamation and irrigation, with an emphasis on drip irrigation to store enough water to cushion citizens from food shortage.Eugene said the water scarcity has been worsened by climate change and increasing demand for water due to population growth and urbanisation.However, experts believe the challenge can be addressed by conserving 75 per cent of untapped water.In his speech, the CS said the newly-enacted water Act 2016 will see the establishment of new water institutions to streamline the water sector, and ensure affordable and sufficient access to clean water for all.A study by Icraf and Unep shows Kenya&rsquo;s rainwater potential is more than 350 billion cubic metres. If captured and managed, it is enough to support 233 million people or close to five times the current population of the country.
