The rains will cease next month, ending a season that Kenyans hoped would stop the current drought and food shortage.April was the peak rainfall month this long-rains season, but the latest forecast shows the remaining rains will fall at the weekend.The March-May rains are the most important as farmers plant during this season.Yesterday, acting director of Kenya Meteorological Department Peter Ambenje said the month will end with a heavy downpour at the weekend.&ldquo;Heavy rainfall is expected from Saturday through Monday, mainly in Central Highlands, Central Rift and Western,&rdquo; he said.Ambenje said the rainfall around Lake Victoria, and in Central Kenya will be particularly heavy.Before then, most parts of the country will remain dry.The three-month forecast issued last month showed April would be the wettest month this season and the rains would start to cease in May.But a review of the month&rsquo;s weather shows heavy rains were irregular and were often replaced with long dry spells.Sunny and dry weather conditions remained dominant over northeastern, although Western received heavy rains.This means the country is not out of the woods yet and effects of the drought will continue to be felt.In February, President Uhuru Kenyatta declared drought a natural disaster, saying at least three million people faced starvation in 23 counties.The government released Sh7.3 billion to be distributed to the livestock, agriculture, water, health and nutrition, interior, special programmes and drought coordination sectors.In a Supplementary Budget tabled in Parliament three months to the end of the financial year, the National Treasury sought an additional Sh6.9 billion to deal with drought.State House spokesperson Manoah Esipisu said water supply to 23 arid and semi-arid counties has been increased, and the government is buying weak animals, slaughtering and distributing the meat to residents to eat and store in traditional ways, such as drying.Agriculture CS Willy Bett said the government is taking long-term measures to mitigate against drought.&ldquo;Livestock insurance is one key thing, which would help us cushion farmers whenever there is a drought. This kind of insurance payment is going to help those pastoral households affected by drought,&rdquo; he said.In March, Agriculture PS Richard Lesiyampe urged farmers to buy fertliser on time and prepare their land early to maximise on the rains.
