ODM has postponed its nominations in Vihiga County from Saturday to Tuesday, April 25.In a statement to newsrooms, communications director Philip Etale said the National Elections Board reached the decision as the Amani National Congress, a NASA co-partner, has scheduled its primaries on Saturday.&ldquo;The Board met this afternoon to deliberate on the matter and has now directed that the party primaries for Vihiga County be pushed forward to Tuesday, April 25, 2017 alongside Nairobi, Garissa and Makueni Counties,&rdquo; Etale said on Thursday. Voting in Vihiga had previously been pushed from Friday to Saturday in yet another reorganization of the primaries. &ldquo;The Board regrets the inconvenience caused to party members and aspirants in Vihiga County,&rdquo; Etale added.Earlier, the party also rescheduled primaries for Homa Bay and Migori from Friday to Monday alongside those for Siaya, Kisumu and Uasin Gishu.ODM nominations over the weekend will therefore take place only in five polling stations in Taita sub-county of Taita Taveta County.The stations failed to conduct the exercise on Tuesday due to heavy rains.
