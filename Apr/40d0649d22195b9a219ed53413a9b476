A 35-year-old businessman was yesterday charged with defiling his daughter in Ruai.He is accused of defiling his 13-year-old daughter between May 2013 and January 2017 at Ruai shopping center in Njiru.He faces an alternative charge of indecently touching the minor without her consent.According to police records, the suspect stays with the complainant and he has been defiling her and threatening her not to reveal his actions.The girl said the man defiled her when her mother was not around. Police said this continued and the man would even tell her to remain behind as her siblings went to bed so he could defile her in the sitting room.She said she told her mother about what was happening but whenever the mother asked her husband if it was true, he would beat her. The mother is said to have given up pursuing the matter.The complainant decided to share the ordered with her mother&rsquo;s friend, who introduced her to a lawyer. The lawyer advised her to report the matter to the police who conducted investigations that led to the arrest.The minor was later taken to hospital for examination.The man denied the charges before chief magistrate Heston Nyaga and was denied bail after the prosecution said he was likely to interfere with the minor if released since they live under the same roof.The case will be mentioned on March 8 for a ruling on bond terms.
