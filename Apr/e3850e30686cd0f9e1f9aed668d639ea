The Ministry of Sports, Culture and Arts has defended the establishment of the new online portal by the Jubilee administration.PS Joe Okudo yesterday said the government is justified in uploading its achievemenst through the web platform. He dismissed claims that the portal was launched close to the August General Election to woo voters. &ldquo;We better understand that the government is perpetual. It is a relay. One government to another inherits projects and debts and initiates new schemes, irrespective of the timescale,&rdquo; he said on Radio Lake Victoria. &ldquo;The government cannot stall projects just because elections are at hand.&rdquo; The PS urged critics of the government publicity drive to cite projects they claim are non-existent on the ground and yet appear on the index of success stories. On April 10, President Uhuru Kenyatta launched the online portal, which showcases development since the administration took office in 2013. The official website is www.delivery.go.ke. It is meant to show Kenyans untold stories of Uhuru&rsquo;s development record. The online portal has received much backlash, especially from the opposition.Within 24 hours of its launch, ODM leaders said Kenyans have been numbed by the dizzying figures of stolen money in the name of grand projects. Okudo said there is everything right with the government extolling its achievements on its web channel. The digital platform, he said, accords the public an opportunity to verify the &lsquo;claims&rsquo; and status of the listed projects. &ldquo;In the Information Age, how else do you expect the government to have a better public outreach than through a dedicated website?&rdquo; he said. Okudo said the government is fulfilling a constitutional obligation to publish any important information affecting the nation. The PS cited achievements in Arts and Culture, such as the digitisation of public library services.
