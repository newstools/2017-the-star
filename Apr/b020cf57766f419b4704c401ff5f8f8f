Kenya Prisons team launch their 2017 Africa Club Championship title campaign with a tricky tie against champions Al Ahly of Egypt in a Pool &lsquo;B&rsquo; match today at the Ksar Hellal Jammel Hall in Monastir, Tunisia.The other Kenya representatives, Kenya Pipeline, cross swords with their unpredictable East Africa counterparts APR of Rwanda, who have been drawn in Pool &lsquo;C&rsquo; in one of the seven matches on card today.Prisons&rsquo; coach David Lung&rsquo;aho acknowledged they have been pitted in a tricky pool alongside University of Zimbabwe, Marsa (Tunisia) and Bejaia (Algeria) but was quick to note that they will fight to go through.&ldquo;On paper, we have three top and competitive teams in one pool and all these teams will want to qualify for the quarters. We want to be among the two. We have played Marsa, Bejaia and Ahly before and won against them and we hope to extend the good run against them. For the tie against Zimbabwe, they are new in the championship and we don&rsquo;t know anything about them but we will give the tie the seriousness it deserves,&rdquo; said Lung&rsquo;aho.Prison will then battle Marsa on Saturday before taking on Bejaia on Sunday. Monday will be a rest day and Prisons will wind up their group stage matches against the Zimbabwean students on Tuesday. Pipeline coach Japheth Munala is equally wary of their opponents in Pool &lsquo;C&rsquo; including Sonatrach (Algeria), Army (Rwanda )and Bafia of Cameroon.Munala, who guided the local champions to a bronze medal last time out, noted: &ldquo;Sonatrach and Bafia have always given us hard time and at the same time we can&rsquo;t underestimate Rwanda, who are coming up very well. We&rsquo;ll give our very best in all the matches and hopefully, the results will favour us.&rdquo;Pipeline take on Sonatrach on Saturday before taking a two-day rest and wrap up their preliminary stage matches against Bafia on Tuesday. Carthage; Sfaxien (Tunisia), Asec (Ivory Coast), INJS (Cameroon) and Ndejje (Uganda) are drawn in Pool &lsquo;A&rsquo; while pool &lsquo;D&rsquo; has Shams (Egypt), ARSU (Seychelles) and FAP (Cameroon).In other matches today, Injis play Asec, Sfaxien take on ARSU, Bafia battle Sonatrach, Marsa entertain Bejaia while FAP face Shams.
