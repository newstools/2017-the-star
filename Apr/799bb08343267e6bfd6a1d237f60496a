The weatherman says light rains are likely to return this weekend. However, the showers could soon be replaced with long sunny intervals. &ldquo;You remember from the beginning we said most parts of the country would experience depressed rains. We won&rsquo;t have continuous rains, but we will have prolonged dry spells within the season,&rdquo; deputy head of meteorological services Peter Ambenje said. Save the Children warned the situation in Somalia could be far worse than the 2011 famine, which claimed 260,000 lives. &ldquo;We are currently facing potentially the worst humanitarian disaster the world has known since 1945,&rdquo; says Mike Noyes at the charity ActionAid. The light rains will start tomorrow and spread to most parts of Kenya at the weekend. However, Turkana, West Pokot and Samburu counties will continue to bathe in hot sun this week and early next week, the seven-day forecast shows. The rains began two weeks ago but were quickly replaced with sunny spells. Ambenje said this is likely to be the norm this season. Some experts have attributed the lack of rains to a little-known climate phenomenon known as the &ldquo;Indian Ocean Dipole&rdquo;, or the Indian version of El Ni&ntilde;o. This refers to the sea&rsquo;s surface temperatures in the eastern Indian Ocean off Indonesia, cycling between cold and warm compared to the western part of the ocean. The dipole was particularly strong in 2016, with warm temperatures in the east creating more moisture in the atmosphere. &ldquo;Things will not improve any time soon... In East Africa, these severe droughts will become the norm,&rdquo; says Robert Marchant, head of the Institute for Tropical Ecosystems at Britain&rsquo;s University of York.President Uhuru Kenyatta in February declared the ongoing drought a national disaster.
