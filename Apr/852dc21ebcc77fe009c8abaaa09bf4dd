Suba South constituency aspirant Caroli Omondi has urged ODM to nullify the nominations in which incumbent MP John Mbadi defeated him.Some of his supporters staged demonstrations at Magunga trading centre yesterday.&ldquo;I have petitioned the party&rsquo;s tribunal to consider evaluating results of three polling stations that had abnormalities,&rdquo; he said.The former aide to NASA leader Raila Odinga said there had been anomalies at God Oloo, Mikuyu and Miria polling centres.He disputed results that indicated Mbadi won with 12,365 votes against his 11,597.&ldquo;The party NEB can either repeat nominations in the three areas or nullify them and announce me as the winner,&rdquo; he said.But Mbadi refuted the claims, saying he won fairly.&ldquo;I urge my brother Caroli to accept the results. It is not fair for him to dispute results of a contest in which he has lost,&rdquo; Mbadi said.
