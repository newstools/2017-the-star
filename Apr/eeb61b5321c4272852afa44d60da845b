A Senate committee was yesterday put on the spot for laxity in implementing crucial House reports.Several senators raised concern the Implementation committee has failed to ensure reports from House panels are executed by the relevant agencies.The senators complained reports are tabled but end up gathering dust in shelves, even though some contain important recommendations for the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission and the Directorate of Criminal Investigations.Senate minority leader Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula concurred with Mandera Senator Billow Kerrow and their Makueni counterpart Mutula Kilonzo Jnr, who said the committee had failed the Senate.&ldquo;There is evidence of massive looting of public resources by some governors and the petitioners have provided sufficient evidence. Petitions can never be brought to this House, worked on and just kept. The office of the speaker has a duty to order and direct implementation,&rdquo; Wetang&rsquo;ula said.&ldquo;Committees of this House cannot engage in the wastage of public money hearing the petitions only to be sent back to the petitioners in the village who have played their role in keeping vigil,&rdquo; he said. Temporay speaker Wilfred Machage said the committee has failed and urged senators to consider amending the Standing Orders to give the senators more say on petitions. &ldquo;From my analysis, it is clear the committee is not doing its work,&rdquo; he said. The committee is chaired by Siaya Senator James Orengo (pictured).
