Former Chama Cha Uzalendo leader Wavinya Ndeti has criticised Ukambani leaders opposed to Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka being Raila Odinga&rsquo;s running-mate in the NASA line-up.Ndeti on Saturday urged the Kamba community to ignore such leaders, saying they are rejecting the arrangement, yet they had the opportunity to ensure Kalonzo flies the NASA flag, but failed.&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t they lobby for Kalonzo to become NASA&rsquo;s flagbearer? Let&rsquo;s keep our votes behind Raila and Kalonzo,&rdquo; she said during a rally in Mavoko Stadium.Ndeti said Kalonzo has not got a raw deal &ldquo;as propagated by some few selfish leaders&rdquo;.&ldquo;We should all support the Raila-Kalonzo arrangement. The ODM leader will serve for only five years, then Kalonzo takes over,&rdquo; she said.Meanwhile, Ndeti accused some politicians she did not name of trying to create a rift between her and Kalonzo. She said the politicians are selfish and do not have the interests of the Kamba community at heart.&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not part ways with Kalonzo. I&rsquo;ll stick with him and support his political ideologies until NASA forms the next government,&rdquo; the former Mavoko MP said.Her rival, Machakos Deputy Governor Bernard Kiala, moved to court after Wiper directly nominated her to run for the county&rsquo;s top job.&ldquo;I told the party leader that I&rsquo;m ready for nominations. I don&rsquo;t fear Kiala,&rdquo; Ndeti said, accusing him of being a project of the forces that oppose the NASA lineup.She expressed confidence she could defeat Kiala in primaries and added she will emerge tops on August 8.Wiper gave Ndeti a direct ticket after she ditched CCU in favour of the Kalonzo-led outfit early in the year.This strained Kiala&rsquo;s relationship with the party leadership.The deputy county chief insisted that Wiper must abide by its constitution and subject them to a preliminary poll so residents have a chance to decide who between them will square it off with incumbent Governor Alfred Mutua.
