President Uhuru Kenyatta yesterday broke ground for the construction of the Olkaria V power project, which will produce 158MW of electricity.The President at the same time commissioned 14 wellhead units providing a total of 75MW of electricity. The &lsquo;wellhead unit&rsquo; is a unique technology developed by Kenyan engineers to harness geothermal power.It has reduced the duration between the first drilling of a well and installation of a geothermal plant from five years to two years.The President challenged other Kenyan institutions to adopt the innovative approach of KenGen to transform the country. &ldquo;Innovation must be the new identity of Kenyan institutions if we are going to see the transformation Kenyans demand,&rdquo; said the President when he spoke at the function at Olkaria, Nakuru county.Uhuru said the Jubilee government has a clear vision to provide sufficient, cheap, green and reliable energy for Kenya.&ldquo;Once again, the path is clear: we expect that the peak load will grow to about 15,000 MW by 2030; that demand will be met by raising installed capacity gradually to 19,200 MW by 2030,&rdquo; the President said. He said the expansion of geothermal power production would contribute to Kenya&rsquo;s prosperity. &ldquo;In commissioning these wells, and in breaking ground for the new project, we take a mighty step on the road to prosperity for this nation,&rdquo; said the President. He said Kenya has one of the largest reserves of geothermal energy and more plants will be constructed to harness the power for the benefit of Kenyans.&ldquo;That this form of energy is not subject to the vagaries of the weather, and that it runs at a respectable rate more than 90 per cent of the time every year, means that we can bring reliable power to every home,&rdquo; said the President. Energy Cabinet Secretary Charles Keter said Kenya has come a long way and is a trendsetter in the energy sector.He said President Kenyatta has shown commitment to maintain and increase Kenya&rsquo;s global leadership in green power generation and consumption.Nakuru Governor Kinuthia Mbugua and Japan&rsquo;s Ambassador to Kenya also spoke at the function.
