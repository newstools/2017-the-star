A Nyeri governor aspirant has moved to court to stop a bank from selling his Sh25 million property to recover a loan he took three years ago.Evanson Githinji of Cocorico Investments accuses Jamii Bora Bank of placing hurdles before him, as he plans to repay the loan.The politician says the bank has written to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission and the Jubilee Party alleging that he lacks integrity and cannot be trusted to hold a public office, in a bid to tarnish his name.He wants the High Court to stop the planned sale or appointing a receiver manager or liquidator to manage his business.Githinji says he purchased the two properties through a loan of Sh369 million, advanced to Green Africa International Limited. He adds that the loan was guaranteed by Cocorico Investments, where he is a director.Although the bank says he has defaulted, he denies the allegation claiming that the bank has been charging unlawful interest contrary to the Banking (Amendments) Act of 2016.He also claims the bank has already sent Neptune Credit auctioneers, giving him 14 days to repay the loan or the property is sold.Githinji says the bank plans to subdivide the property, develop them and sell them to redeem the loan.The sale scheduled for April 26 is premature and laden with ill motives and illegality, he says. The politician says the bank has not undertaken a forced sale valuation of the property and that this is a plan to degrade and devalue the assets with a view to disposing them at throwaway prices.He says if the bank is not stopped from taking his property he will suffer great loss, which cannot be compensated with damages.
