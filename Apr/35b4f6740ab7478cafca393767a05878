A storm is brewing in NASA after Wiper yesterday accused Raila Odinga&rsquo;s ODM party of &ldquo;bullying and undermining&rdquo; other coalition partners ahead of the primaries.National Assembly minority leader Francis Nyenze (pictured) hit out at the Orange party, saying Raila&rsquo;s outfit wants to suffocate other partners by handing out direct tickets.&ldquo;ODM has set a very bad precedent because there are aspirants from partner parties who are contesting against those governors,&rdquo; he told the Star in a phone interview.Nyenze, the Kitui West MP, said some ODM members have resorted to blackmailing other partners to silence them from questioning the &ldquo;dictatorial tendencies&rdquo;.&ldquo;When we point out some of these glaring issues, they call people like me a tribalist, but when they do it, they are high priests,&rdquo; he said, adding ODM&rsquo;s &ldquo;selfish interests&rdquo; will kill the NASA spirit. He said Wiper will oppose any further move by ODM to issue direct nominations to regions considered battle grounds without consulting other partners.The net effect is ODM will end up having strong and popular aspirants in such regions, giving the party a head start.Raila on Monday issued direct tickets to 400 unopposed aspirants, among them seven governors and aspirants for parliamentary seats. In ODM strongholds, MP aspirants have one foot in Parliament. &ldquo;These people [ODM] have divided NASA,&rdquo; Nyenze said. ODM begins its primaries on Friday and they will run up until the 22nd.
