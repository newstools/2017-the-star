Garissa Senator Yussuf Haji faces an uphill task to defend his post as political realignments take shape.Like other Northeastern counties, aspirants in Garissa have been relying on clan elders to pick candidates, while prevailing upon other contestants to drop out in a negotiated democracy move.Garissa is inhabited by three main Ogaden subclans &mdash; the Samawathal, Abduwak and Aulyhan, while there are also substantial voters called &lsquo;corner tribe&rsquo; comprising other small communities from various parts of Kenya.All the sub-sections have been bargaining for political posts with other clans to get seats.Senator Haji, who is running on the Jubilee Party ticket, is banking his reelection bid on a clan pact between the Samawathal and Abduwak, under the Tolomoge Alliance, that has picked him as their preferred candidate.In the pact, the Abduwak have been given the green light to contest the governor and woman representative seats, while the Samawathal will select candidates for the senator and deputy governor positions.Haji will be battling two former MPs &mdash; ODM&rsquo;s Major (Rtd) Aden Sugow (Fafi) and PNU&rsquo;s Abdullahi Sheikh Dahir (Lagdera), among other contenders.Haji&rsquo;s political career is further complicated by his younger brother Bashir Yussuf, who is contesting for governor, and this will meddle with the Samawathal-Abduwak clans pact.Bashir has been prevailed upon by some community members to drop his bid and support Ali Korane, the preferred candidate for the Tolomoge Alliance. But he has refused to back down.Rtd Major Sugow, from the Abduwak subclan, who rejected the elders&rsquo; verdict on picking candidates, accused the incumbent of doing little to address issues bedevilling the county.&ldquo;I have rejected the clan elders&rsquo; decision because it&rsquo;s not binding. They cannot impose candidates on the electorate. I have also decided to campaign without aligning myself with any governor aspirant because it won&rsquo;t be possible to do oversight if your preferred candidate wins,&rdquo; he said.But Haji, a silent political schemer, said he has done a lot in making sure the county&rsquo;s resources are used prudently.
