President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s administration has ensured equity in access to electricity through the Last Mile Connectivity Project and primary school connections, State House Spokesperson Manoah Esipisu has said. He said Western, Eastern and Nyanza are among the regions that have seen the highest increase in new connections. Esipisu said the status of connectivity in Homa Bay county in February 2017 was 47,212 households compared to only 11,071 in June 2013, an addition of 36,141 connections. Esipisu dismissed as baseless suggestions implying some parts of the country have been sidelined. &ldquo;Any persons or organisations insinuating that the government&rsquo;s effort to provide electricity could be skewed in favour of some regions do not know what they are talking about and could not be further from the truth.&rdquo;
