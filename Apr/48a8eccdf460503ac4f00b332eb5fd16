Former Miss Tanzania Wema Sepetu and Big Brother winner Idris Sultan broke up several months ago after a relationship that was doing well finally went down the drain. During their public relationship, Sepetu revealed that she had had Idris' twins, after which she had a miscarriage. The two broke up soon afterwards and were seen attacking each other on social media. Today, Wema posted a photo of herself in a romantic pose with fellow actor by the name Gabo Zigamba. This photo got Idris sultan, her ex, burning with jealousy and he could not help but comment: "Anti ile miti kule nyuma naweza kupata wapi? Nimetafuta sana" Wema Sepetu replied; "Anko naona kupita kimya kimya imeshindikana kabisa... Ila unaweza ipata pale karibu na Mahaba Beach..."
