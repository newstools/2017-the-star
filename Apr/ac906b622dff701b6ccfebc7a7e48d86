Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital have launched new technology in sports surgery known as Arthroscopy aimed at making the service available for the local sports-people.Arthroscopy involves injury treatment through minimal invasive surgical procedure which will ensure that the patients&rsquo; other tissues are not interfered with hence faster healing. According to the hospital management, the Sports Medicine wing has acquired the new equipments worth Sh30 million to bolster the section as it ventured into the sector.MTRH CEO Wilson Aruasa said the wing will benefit more sports-people in the region who have been forced to seek medical attention abroad due to lack of such technology.&ldquo;The hospital is the only public facility equipped with the state-of-the-art endoscopic machines which is able to screen and diagnose ailments as well,&rdquo; Aruasa said.With the region harbouring most of the athletes who have been stricken by injuries forcing them to abandon their training, they will be able to access the service at an affordable price.&ldquo;I know that we have upcoming athletes who sometimes get injured during their training and lack money to get treatment. They will be able to benefit because it will be affordable. Remember that the wing will also treat different forms of injuries,&rdquo; he said.Aruwasa said that one operation will cost Sh105,000 compared to Sh800,000 charged abroad for the same treatment. &ldquo;Small incisions are done on the patients unlike in the past where doctors had to open the patients entire body. This is the new technology in the sports medicine and we are happy that the city of champions is making strides as well in the field,&rdquo; said Aruasa.The sports clinic will be opened on Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays. Former Harambee Stars Under-19 player, Dominic Kiprono was among the athletes present during the launch.
