Kewopa chairperson Cecily Mbarire yesterday urged women to deny opposition chief Raila Odinga votes for blocking nominated Senator Elizabeth Ongoro from running for Ruaraka MP on the ODM ticket.Mbarire, the Runyenjes MP, said Raila is unfair to women for expelling Ongoro from the party, despite her being one of his staunch supporters.As the leader of the Kenya Women Parliamentary Association, she is disappointed with Raila.The ODM leader has been lying to women that he supports them in politics and leadership, but his move against Ongoro shows that he does not.&ldquo;I want to tell Raila that the women of Kenya have realised that you are the worst supporter of women. I want to ask all women to deny him votes because he does not believe in women leadership,&rdquo; Mbarire said in Kanyuambora.She advised Raila to learn from President Uhuru Kenyatta who supports women leaders.Mbarire said she is where she is because the President gave her an opportunity in Jubilee.On Thursday last week, Ongoro was fined Sh1 million for causing chaos at Orange House. She and her supporters had stormed the offices alleging planned rigging. She was also barred from running for Ruaraka MP.Ongoro defected to Amani on Friday and will run for Ruaraka MP on the ANC ticket.
