Fire razed the St Benedict High School Budalang&rsquo;i dormitory in Bunyala subcounty yesterday.Students were in class for their morning preps.Dormitory master Joseph Ombudie could not immediately confirm the value of property destroyed. The cause of the fire is yet to be established.Ombudie and the students faulted the management for putting fencing the dormitory with barbed wire, making it difficult for them to put out the fire fast enough.Scores of students sustained serious injuries as they struggled to put out the fire.&ldquo;The fire spread so fast. The school management is at fault because of the barbed wire it erected around the dormitory,&rdquo; Ombudie said.The students also accused the administration of failing to refill the fire extinguishers used to put out a fire at the school two weeks earlier.Principal John Juma was unavailable for comment.
