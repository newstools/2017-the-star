New York-based Carlson Rezidor Hotel Group Wednesday opened its second outlet in Nairobi after nearly three-year delay due to slower construction works than earlier planned. The mid-sized Park Inn by Radisson in Westlands, which has 140 rooms, a restaurant, bar and other facilities, is targeting modern travelers looking for an international mid-scale hospitality experience. &ldquo;This landmark property will certainly set the bar very high for the mid-scale hotel brands in Africa, with its contemporary design and architecture, and international standards,&rdquo; Rezidor Hotel Group vice president for Africa &amp; Indian Ocean Marc Descrozaille said in a statement. This is the second hotel under the group after Radisson Blu in Nairobi&rsquo;s Upper Hill opened its doors in November 2015. Rezidor Hotel group&rsquo;s senior vice president for business development in Africa and Indian Ocean Andrew Mclachlan said the firm plans to increase its footprint. The group has planned another hotel near the Arboretum in Nairobi next year. &ldquo;The hotel is a great showcase and catalyst for us to take this brand into the depths of Kenya, in areas such as Mombasa and Kisumu,&rdquo; Mclachlan said.
