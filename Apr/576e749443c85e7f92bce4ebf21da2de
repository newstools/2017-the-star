Embattled Kisumu county Jubilee Party chairpeson Christine Atieno Otieno has been replaced by JP deputy chairman for operations Zuberi Liete amid resistance. Otieno has been under pressure to relinquish the position after she declared her interest to run against Governor Jack Ranguma during party primaries slated for april 24. Liete assumed Otieno’s position during the JP executive meeting following a directive by party secretary general Raphael Tuju. Otieno had refused to resign despite calls by JP members that she should respect the party constitution. Otieno stormed the meeting with hired goons to protest her replacement. “I am the chairperson and you cannot bar and replace me,” she said. However, police intervened and the meeting kicked off.
