Farmers will have to wait for one week to know what chemical to use against the destructive armyworms.Kenya Agricultural Livestock Research Organisation director general Eliud Kireger yesterday said they are conducting field tests in Kitale to determine the most effective pesticide.The worm has been reported in Trans Nzoia, Bungoma, Kakamega, Uasin Gishu, Busia, Nandi, Kericho, Baringo, Nakuru and some parts of Coast.&ldquo;We have so many chemicals in the market and even though they have been approved by the Pests Control Produce Board, as an organisation mandated to safeguard the the interest of the farmers, we want to be sure farmers are using the right chemical,&rdquo; he said.Kireger said it is the first time the fall armyworm has been reported in Kenya so there is no specific control chemical that has been recommended for use in the country.&ldquo;We do not want a case where chemical companies rush to recommend certain chemicals to our farmers, only for them [farmers] to spend so much money and not get the expected help to the problem. Therefore, we are keen on this and will only advise farmers when we are sure,&rdquo; he said.The KALRO boss said in the meantime, farmers should ensure they check their farms on a daily basis. If they find the worm, they should immediately report to the county agricultural extension officers or to the nearest KALRO office.He explained that cold or rainy weather condition are not favourable for the growth of the worms so they are likely to decrease.In April 27-28, experts, national plant protection organisations, seed and pest companies will meet in Nairobi to discuss the status and strategy for effective management.The meeting will bring together experts from Africa.
