There will be no love lost when national champions Kenya Pipeline cross swords with local rivals Kenya Prisons in the quarter-final of the ongoing Africa Women&rsquo;s Club Championship in Monastir, Tunisia on Thursday.The new development comes after the two sides wrapped up their group stages matches with wins on Tuesday.Pipeline who had already qualified for the quarters before the Tuesday clash made easy work of Bafia of Cameroon trashing them 3-0 (25-15,25-7,25-14) to go unbeaten atop pool 'C' with nine points.Pipiline who bagged Bronze Medal in the last edition had won their first two matches 3-0 against Patriotic Army of Rwanda and Sonatrach of Algeria respectively.On the flip side, Prisons had begun the title hunt on the wrong footing succumbing to record holders and champions Al Ahly of Egypt 3-1.They however made amends to win their remaining three subsequent matches 3-0 against Bejaia of Algeria, hosts Marsa before they entertained University of Zimbabwe 3-0 (25-15,25-7,25-9) to finish second in pool B with nine points.The Thursday encounter will be the second time the two teams meet at the quarter final stage of the same tournament having met last in 2013 in Madagascar. Prisons won emerged winners with a 3-1 margin.Pipeline coach Japheth Munala however believes past records will not count.&ldquo;The players have performed well at the group stage and we want to carry the same vibe and gusto going forward. We have prepared well and we look forward to the quarter final match.&ldquo;We will give our best shot and let the will of God be done and fate decide," Munala said.The tactician has guided the national champions to win the Kenya Volleyball Federation (KVF) league title back to back since 2014.His opposite number David Lung'aho lauded his players saying focus now shifts to the last eight clash."It was a worthy fight and finally we finished runner up behind Al Ahly in pool 'B'. We gave a chance to every player in Tuesday match but Yvonne Wavinya, Anne Lowen and Immaculate Chemtai were extremely good and we hope they keep up with the same fight going forward," Lung'aho said."At this rate it is a guarantee one Kenyan team will be in the semi-finals and we want to play well against Pipeline and go all the way and win the title," added Lung&rsquo;aho who also doubles up as KVF technical director.All teams will have a rest day on Wednesday as games resume on Thursday.
