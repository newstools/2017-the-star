More than 10,000 families of Mitangoni, Kaloleni constituency, have accused NLC chairman Muhammad Swazuri of colluding with unidentified people to steal 7,100 acres intended for the standard gauge railway.Residents are planning to petition for Swazuri&rsquo;s removal for allegedly failing to resolve the case involving the land worth Sh22 billion.Senior government officials, politicians and businessmen are alleged to be orchestrating removal of residents from the land due to its proximity to the SGR. The railway will start operation in June and the value of the land will increase exponentially.Small-holder farmer Tswangwa Chome has been accused of working with individuals behind the scheme to claim ownership of the 7,100 acres.The land has several public utilities, including Shangai Primary school, Shangai Secondary School, Shangai dispensary, mosques and churches. Chome was allegedly helped to secure the title deed for the 7,100 acres in August 20, 2014, by the people behind the scheme. &ldquo;It is impossible for a poor man to own 7,100 acres. There are individuals behind him, who want to use him for their selfish interests,&rdquo; Kaloleni MP Gunga Mwinga (pictured) said on Saturday. Swazuri, who has been in the area twice, is said to have written a report in favour of Chome, saying he is the genuine owner of the 7,100 acres.Yesterday, Swazuri denied the allegations as &ldquo;mere rumours.&rdquo; Speaking to the Star on the phone, he said the report favours all residents, not an individual as alleged. Swazuri said he is ready for the petition because, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m now used to them.
