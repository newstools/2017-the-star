Kiambu governor aspirant Ferdinand Waititu was blocked by police when he attempted to gain access to the Kiambu tallying centre on Monday night.County commander Adiel Nyange said Waititu thought the centre was a distribution venue for voting materials.He dismissed claims that the aspirant was arrested while in possession of ballot papers.Waititu is fighting it out with the incumbent William Kabogo for the Jubilee ticket ahead of the August 8 polls.Last week, Waititu and his running mate James Nyoro signed a MoU as part of a strategy to unseat Governor William Kabogo.The &ldquo;unique&rdquo; power sharing agreement, already filed at the Jubilee party headquarters, aims at consolidating their support bases."The MoU is unique because we needed not to change the constitution to actualise it," Nyoro told the Star on phone on Tuesday."A great wave of change is coming to Kiambu county."Part of the agreement will see the two share on the 50-50 basis senior appointments such as county executive committee members.Nyoro is a former MD at Rockefeller Foundation in charge of Africa, while Waititu is a battle-hardened popular politician.Read: Waititu, former DP Ruto aide sign MoU to beat Kabogo in Friday primariesAfter 2013 polls, Nyoro was appointed a senior food security and climate change advisor to the presidency.He was based at DP William Ruto's office.Read: Waititu will beat Kabogo hands down in Kiambu governor race - poll&nbsp;
