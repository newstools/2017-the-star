Mombasa county commissioner Evans Achoki (pictured) yesterday told parents to talk to their wayward children or the government will take action.&ldquo;If you cannot control your children, let the government do its work,&rdquo; he said.This comes barely two days after two suspected members of a criminal gang in Nairobi&rsquo;s Eastleigh area were gunned down by people in civilian clothes believed to be police officers.Police said the two were members of the feared Super Power Gang and were about to commit a robbery. Achoki spoke at his office after launching the Mombasa peace campaign. The campaign message is &ldquo;tusipige jirani, tisiharibu mali ya jirani, tupige kura&rdquo;, which loosely translates to &ldquo;Let us not turn against our neighbours, let us not destroy our neighbours&rsquo; property, let us vote&rdquo;.
