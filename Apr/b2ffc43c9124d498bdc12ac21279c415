Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago and Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi have alleged a rigging plot by Deputy President William Ruto&rsquo;s aides in the Jubilee Party nominations.They said Farouk Kibet and Reuben Maiyo have a list of preferred candidates they will &ldquo;assist&rdquo; to win the primaries on Friday, despite Ruto&rsquo;s assurance that his office and Jubilee will not take sides.Mandago said his rival Bundotich Kiprop, popularly known as Buzeki, is being used to remove him from office.Sudi urged Farouk and Maiyo to do the work they were employed to do and stop meddling in the region&rsquo;s politics.&ldquo;We know they are doing it without the knowledge of the DP, but we will not allow them to have their way,&rdquo; he said. The two were speaking during a rally at Ziwa market,Uasin Gishu, on Monday.Mandago is facing stiff competition from Buzeki, while Sudi is set for a bruising battle against former UN employee Steve Kewa. Buzeki and Kewa are said to be carrying out well-oiled campaigns, causing jitters among the incumbents.Some JP aspirants yesterday told the Star Kibet and Maiyo have been meeting with the selected aspirants.Farouk denied the claims. &ldquo;Since the campaigns started, I have not been to any political function or spoken to any aspirant. The only place I visit is church to pray and go back home,&rdquo; he told the Star on the phone.&ldquo;All that propaganda is nonsense because I have no power to influence how people will vote. I am not a Jubilee Party official. If anything, I have only one vote &ndash; for President Uhuru Kenyatta.&rdquo; Farouk said the two are looking for scapegoats after sensing defeat.Claims of a secret list are causing jitters in the Jubilee camp, especially in the North Rift, Ruto&rsquo;s home turf.
