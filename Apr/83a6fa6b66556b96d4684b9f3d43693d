Former Kathiani MP Wavinya Ndeti&rsquo;s partnership with outgoing EALA MP Peter Mathuki in the race for Machakos governor is said to be making incumbent Alfred Mutua jittery. Mathuki dropped his governor bid and will be Ndeti&rsquo;s running mate. Ndeti joined Wiper this month.Mutua has reportedly been hoping Deputy Governor Bernard Kiala, Ndeti and Mathuki would run separately to split votes and ensure him an easy win.&ldquo;Mutua is panicking. Even his strongest supporter Mwengi Mutuse has expressed fears because he knows Ndeti and Mathuki&rsquo;s collaboration is lethal,&rdquo; a source who declined to be named said. Mavoko MP Patrick Makau said Mutua&rsquo;s fate is sealed and he will be sent home.
