Jubilee presiding officers did not know that they were supposed to source for vehicles to transport voting materials within their jurisdiction.Caroline Wangari, deputy organising secretary, said they received information at 3 am that the officers were required to source for transportation."Presiding officers then reported that the vehicles they got were charging more money that the party had allocated," Wangari said on Friday. The confusion was the cause of delays witnessed in the Jubilee nominations in most parts of the country.

We read mischief in this exercise," a voter said.By 6 am, hundreds of clerks who spent the night at Technology Primary school, Murang'a were told the party had transport challenges.It is only Kigumo, Maragua and Kangema constituencies where voting had started by 8am, albeit with massive discrepancies being reported.Clerks alleged that ballot papers arrived without stamps in 12 polling centres in Kangema. However, the papers were okay in 35 other centres.Details also emerged that new voters&rsquo; names were missing from the register.Those who transferred their polling stations during the mass voter listing were referred back to their old stations.Some aspirants have also complained that the Jubilee Party is using the 2013 IEBC register instead of the updated one."This is locking out many people who registered after that period. They are not serious," an aspirant said.Raphael Tuju, JP secretary-general, barred aspirants or returning officers from issuing statements to the media.More on this: Tuju warns aspirants against commenting on Jubilee Party primaries amid delays
