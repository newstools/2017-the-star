Nearly half of NASA supporters agree with the flagbearer and his deputy named at Uhuru Park rally. This was according to an Ipsos poll that was released yesterday.ODM leader Raila Odinga was named as the National Super Alliance flagbearer. Raila will face off President Uhuru Kenyatta of Jubilee with Kalonzo Musyoka as his running mate.NASA brings together Raila, Musalia Mudavadi (Amani), Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper), Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula (Ford Kenya) and Isaac Rutto (CCM).According to the poll, 49 per cent of the voters support Raila-Kalonzo leadership, while 55 per cent expected it. But fewer identified this pair as their preferred paired-choice rated at 34 per cent. Only seven per cent expected a Raila-Mudavadi leadership, with eight per cent preferring it.Seven per cent of the supporters preferred a Kalonzo-Raila leadership while four per cent expected it.Nine per cent of the voters preferred a Kalonzo-Mudavadi leadership, while four per cent expected that they would be named as the leaders.Two per cent of the supporters expected and preferred Mudavadi-Raila leadership, while one per cent expected a Kalonzo-Wetang&rsquo;ula leadership with two per cent preferring it.Expectations about the Nasa presidential ticket among Jubilee supporters was different.Twenty five per cent of Jubilee supporters preferred the Raila-Kalonzo combination.The only possible combination that receives more support from Jubilee than from Nasa supporters is that of a Kalonzo-Mudavadi ticket rated at 14 per cent verses six per cent.Regarding expectations of NASA unity moving forward, slightly over one-third {38%} feel it is certain.But Nasa supporters are far more confident than those in Jubilee.This was rated at 58 per cent against that of Jubilee rated at 23 per cent.&ldquo;Still the fact that just more than half of the former have such certainty suggests the uncertainty that the NASA leadership will have to overcome as the campaign period approaches ahead of the August election itself,&rdquo; the poll read.According to the poll, slightly fewer than half of all Kenyans rated at 44 per cent were able to spontaneously mention Governor Isaac Rutto as the &ldquo;most important political leader&rdquo; who recently joined NASA.In regional terms, this figure ranges from a high in Nairobi {54%} to a low in Eastern {30 per cent}.The target population for this survey was Kenyans aged 18 years and above living in urban and rural areas.
