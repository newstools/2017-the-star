Bungoma county residents should reelect President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto, but vote out Jubilee leaders who have done nothing for them, including Governor Kenneth Lusaka, Mt Elgon MP John Serut has saidHe spoke to journalists on Sunday at Kibuk Primary School. On Friday last week, Ruto toured the area to woo residents to vote for the Jubilee Party.Serut, who ran as an independent candidate on March 4, 2013, said Uhuru has implemented a few development projects in Mt Elgon, but added that the area has lagged behind since in infrastructure since Independence.&ldquo;We have been discriminated against by the previous many governments that we have supported since Independence, but now we have little hope that this Jubilee government might change that because we are seeing few indications of good gestures,&rdquo; Serut said. Last Friday, Ruto asked Mt Elgon residents to vote for Jubilee so they can benefit more. &ldquo;We want to be on one page and not this independent thing so that when it comes to distribution of the cake you have your share as bonafide stakeholders.&rdquo;But Serut said, &ldquo;Mt Elgon people have been in government since the Kanu regime but we have seen no development. The roads are poor, there&rsquo;s no security, health facilities are few and do not have drugs, schools are pathetic and yet we are in Kenya.&ldquo;We have seen Bungoma, which has been a Ford Kenya zone, receiving so much development and yet we who voted for Jubilee are yet to benefit.&rdquo;The MP said development is a constitutional right whether residents support the government or not.He asked residents to vote for Ford Kenya governor hopeful Wycliffe Wangamati.
