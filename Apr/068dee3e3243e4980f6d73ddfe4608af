The Laikipia government has been criticised for failing to put up a 53km electric fence in Laikipia West subcounty. Laikipia West MP Wachira Karani, governor aspirant Nderitu Muriithi and his running mate John Mwaniki yesterday accused the county administration of alleged misappropriation of public funds.They spoke on a campaign trail in Kaiti village, Muhotetu.Two weeks ago, a contractor sued the government, demanding Sh70 million for breach of contract.Work on the Sh96 million Marmanet-Rumuruti fence began in 2015 after the contract was signed between Ndovu Power Fences and Eco-systems Ltd and the county government. The fence was Governor Joshua Irungu's pet project. During campaigns in 2013, he pledged to build an electric fence to eradicate human-wildlife conflict.But the project, which was commissioned at a colourful ceremony on April 6, 2015, stalled a few months later following misunderstandings between the two parties. Only 20km out of the 53km had been built. The county government later cancelled the contract, saying the work did not meet specified standards.The contractor, who had been paid Sh24 million, obtained an injunction barring the county government from awarding the contract to another party.The two parties tabled their arguments before Nanyuki High Court Judge Mary Kasango with the Power Fences CEO Vincent Baragu arguing that the county government sabotaged his work in total violation of the terms spelt out in the contract.Through his lawyer James Kihara, the applicant told the court his company is a reputable one, having constructed electric fences for such organizations such as Kenya Wildlife Service and African Wildlife Foundation among others which had all expressed satisfaction to his services.The matter will proceed on May 12 when both parties are expected to bring more witnesses.
