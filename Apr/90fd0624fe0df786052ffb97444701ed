A father who allegedly slaughtered his two-year-old child two weeks ago yesterday appeared before a Milimani court.Moses Maina did not take a plea after the prosecution asked the court for more time for the accused to be taken for a second mental checkup.The prosecution said they were asking for a second assessment, because the accused confessed to police he indeed killed his child after he was possessed by &ldquo;spirits&rdquo;.His lawyer Edward Rombo opposed the application, saying the accused should take a plea as soon as possible so that he can apply bond. He also said the court should not give the prosecution more than one week to conduct the mental examination.In her ruling, Justice Jessie Lessit told the lawyer he cannot give the court timelines or dictate the duration of time the court will give to the prosecution.She directed that Maina be taken for further psychiatrist test and the case be mentioned in two weeks.Police reports indicate on that day, the accused waited for his wife to go to work before slitting the child&rsquo;s neck.He then left the house and a few minutes later, the house help went into the child&rsquo;s room to check if the baby was awake and found him in a pool of blood.She alerted neighbours, who called the mother. Police were also called in.Police launched a manhunt for the father.He was arrested and taken to court on Monday last week, where police made a miscellaneous application to have him detained for three days to allow them complete investigations.The case will be mentioned on May 11.
