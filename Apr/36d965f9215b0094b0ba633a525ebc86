Ex-PS Carey Orege has said he is the best choice for Siaya governor ahead of the ODM nominations on April 24.The former regional development PS termed himself the only candidate who has conducted peaceful campaigns.He is facing off with incumbent Cornel Rasanga, Rarieda MP Nicolas Gumbo and businessman William Oduol.The four have launched concerted campaigns ahead of the primaries, turning the race into a do or die affair.Orege said in Bondo on Tuesday that his competitors are only locked up in "senseless war of words"."My opponents are only concerned about who should be heckled, when one should be heckled and where to be heckled," he said on Tuesday."These are all aimed at setting fertile grounds for chaos during nominations and not development."He added that such leaders do not deserve to compete with him on any platform.Last week, youths allied to Gumbo heckled Rasanga in Bondo in the presence of ODM party leader Raila Odinga.They said this was to send him the message that the PAC chair is the best governor candidate.But this did not go well as Raila and ODM county officials blamed Gumbo for being behind the chaos in the county.Orege, while condemning the altercation, asked his competitors not to drag the ODM leader into local politics for selfish interests.He said Raila should be given time to focus on his presidential bid."Such actions are a sign that someone has sensed defeat apart from being a heretical way of seeking publicity."Orege asked Siaya residents should elect a governor who can solve the county's challenges.He cited lack of water, insufficient drug stocks at local dispensaries as well as the need to enable residents to meet basic needs."Displaying how best we can heckle each other in front of our leader, at the expense of selling our policies, is a sign of political immaturity," he said.Orege also warned his competitors against linking him to graft saying the EACC is charged with raising such concerns.He also dismissed opinion polls showing Rasanga as the most popular candidate in the governor race.Read: Fierce fights for ODM tickets in Siaya may turn chaotic as governor, MP races heat up
