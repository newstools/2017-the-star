Laikipia landowners have pumped Sh4 billion into the county economy, but violence threatens the gains made.A survey conducted early this year showed that 37 per cent of the land in the county is owned by European and African ranchers, 32 per cent used by pastoralists for grazing, 21 per cent under small-scale farmers and 9.9 per cent is under the national forest reserve.Martin Evans, chairman of the Laikipia Farmers&rsquo; Association, on Friday said the landowners have created jobs, boosted revenue and community welfare through social responsibility programmes.Food and equipment supplies have also improved, he said in a statement.&ldquo;But months of lawlessness in Laikipia threaten those economic gains. Unless the violence ends, job losses and cuts in funding for social projects will follow. Already, significant investments have been scrapped.&rdquo;LFA said it injected Sh3,778,549,943 into the economy last year.Evans said the contribution increases year after year, adding that businesses constantly search for new ways to tackle problems that hurt sectors of the economy.He cited tourism and livestock trade as the hard-hit sectors since the violence erupted last year.&ldquo;It would be a tragedy to allow the damage to be permanent,&rdquo; Evans said.The survey outlines the significance of large-scale land use in the rural economy and the vital role played by ranches and conservancies from 2014.They want agencies to come in and restore order and calm.
