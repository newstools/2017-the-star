Teso North and South ODM parliamentary candidates Lawi Mamai and Geoffrey Omuse are confident they will win on August 8. Mamai will battle it out with incumbent Arthur Odera of Jubilee, while Omuse will square it out with Mary Emaase, also of Jubilee. &ldquo; I am prepared for the battle ahead of me to ensure the seat, which eluded us in 2013, goes back to ODM. The people of Teso North are primarily ODM members and they support the agenda of the party and of this ODM team,&rdquo; Mamai said on Monday. MCA nominees include Ishmael Orodi (Malaba Central), Grace Olita Omasete (Angurai South), Lawrence Okaale (Ang&rsquo;urai North), Joab Oteba (Ang&rsquo;urai East), Ichasi Imwene (Malaba North) and David Kokonya (Malaba South). Mamai said the candidates will hold joint campaigns. He said the ODM team will campaign for Governor Sospeter Ojaamong and ODM party leader Raila Odinga.
