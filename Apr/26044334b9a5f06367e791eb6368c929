Elgeyo Marakwet Governor Alex Tolgos has distanced himself from a fundraiser invitation (pictured) for his reelection bid doing the rounds on social media. He said it is fake. Tolgos urged residents not to send money to phone numbers indicated in the invitation cards. On Saturday, he said he will invite supporters to a fundraiser soon. The fake invitation card stated the fundraiser would be presided over by Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago. Tolgos did not disclose whether he has reported the matter to the police. Some of Tolgos&rsquo;s Facebook followers said the invite may have been an April Fool&rsquo;s Day prank. &ldquo;Which one is the April Fool&rsquo;s prank? Is it the invitation card or your disclaimer?&rdquo; Sharon Kosgei asked. Some social media users speculated the fundraiser was organised by local power brokers.
