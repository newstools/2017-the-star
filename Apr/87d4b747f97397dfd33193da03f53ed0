Nyandarua Deputy Governor Waithaka Mwangi says if elected county boss he will restore good governance, proper management of public resources and accountability.&ldquo;We have been having and hearing Nyandarua being criticised right, left and centre due to mismanagement of public funds,&rdquo; Mwangi said on Sunday when he announced his manifesto and campaign.The governor is Daniel Waithaka.He said he will ensure efficient use of funds, improve livelihoods and restore the dignity and pride of residents.Mwangi said his manifesto is anchored on three pillars &mdash; social, political and economic &mdash; that constitute the Jubilee Party manifesto.&ldquo;We are members of JP, hence, we have adopted and a will use these pillars to suit Nyandarua&rsquo;s needs,&rdquo; he said.The deputy governor said that when devolution was implemented in 2013, Nyandarua formulated the County Integrated Development Plan. The aim ws to build a united and prosperous county, where political, economic and social benefits were equitably distributed to everyone. This has not happened, he said.&ldquo;From the word go, I realised that whoever took the helm of managing public funds in Nyandarua was not doing as expected. That is what has made me feel we need a person who will think of and look at Nyandarua as one county &mdash; and not his village,&rdquo; he said.Mwangi said his leadership will ensure fair distribution of appointments, in contrast with the current situation where senior officials com from one area.&ldquo;The Nyandarua governor, county assembly speaker, chairman of the county public service board and senior county executive committee members are all from Ol Kalou. This has not augured well for this county,&rdquo; he said&ldquo;For instance, it does not make sense that Kinangop, with 122,000 registered voters, has only one CEC member.&rdquo;Mwangi said the youth of Nyandarua have talents and energy but the current leadership has no agenda on how these assets can be tapped and used for the good of the county.He said his leadership will come up with plans to ensure the youth are actively involved in development of Nyandarua because &ldquo;we may be sitting on a time bomb if our young people are not working.&rdquo;The procession to launch Mwangi&rsquo;s campaign and manifesto began at Soko Mjinga at the border of Nyandarua and Kiambu counties, and snaked through fly-over, Mawingu, Njabini, Engineer, Ndunyu Njeru, Miharati to Ol Kalou.At every stop, he criticised those who have been calling him a noisemaker in Nyandarua.&ldquo;My shouting has been based on the fact that when you see something wrong, you must be able to say it is wrong without fear or favour. &ldquo;That is my nature. I don&rsquo;t live in fear when things are done wrongly,&rdquo; Mwangi said.
