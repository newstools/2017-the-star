A driver and 19 school
children were killed in South Africa when the minibus they were
travelling in collided with a truck and exploded in a ball of
fire in Mpumalanga province, emergency services said on Friday. The vehicle was ferrying children from school when it
collided with the truck between the towns of Verena and
Bronkhorstpruit, northeast of the capital Pretoria, Russel
Meiring, ER24 spokesman said. Several children were injured, he said. The dead children lay trapped inside the burnt out shell of
the vehicle that stood on its side, he said. It was not clear what caused the collision, police said. "The (minibus) was transporting learners from school and it
collided with the truck and caught fire," Mpumalanga police
spokesman Gerald Sedibe said. He said the minibus driver was
killed, while the truck driver survived. Even though it is Africa's most industrialised economy with
a modern road network, South Africa has a dire road safety
record. Road deaths rose to 235 during this year's Easter
weekend compared with 156 fatalities last year, transport
officials said earlier on Friday.
