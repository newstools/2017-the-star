All political aspirants will pay a fee to the National Environment Management Authority for removing their posters after the August 8 elections.Nema said the deposit bond will be refundable if the aspirants clear their posters and the agency&rsquo;s officials ascertain it.&ldquo;The bond will be deposited in the Nema Environment Restoration Fund account. The counties will also be included to make the exercise effective,&rdquo; Nema compliance and enforcement officer Zephania Ouma said.He said currently, the Environment Management Coordination Act 2013 does not stipulate how much should be paid as deposit bonds, hence Nema, the IEBC and the Council of Governors will meet and give direction.&ldquo;We will also deliberate on whether it will be the party or coalition to deposit the bond on behalf of aspirants or the individual aspirant. The recommendations of the meeting will be communicated in a week,&rdquo; Ouma said.Meanwhile, IEBC communications and public affairs manager Andrew Limo welcomed the move, saying every Kenyan has a right to have a clean environment.&ldquo;It is a great initiative that should be supported but should be taken by Nema and the county government,&rdquo; he said.Ouma said the deposit bond is also applicable to industrial plants and undertakings which have or are likely to have adverse effects on the environment.&ldquo;The purpose of this environment deposit bond is to ensure good environmental practices,&rdquo; he said.It also ensures compliance with remediation obligations, availability of funds for remediation and sustainable development.
