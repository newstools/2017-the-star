Two leaders from Garissa county have appealed to the Kenyan Red Cross and other aid agencies to urgently intervene and help in tackling the current drought ravaging the region.Speaking to the Star on the phone separately, Dertu MCA Abdi Ali and livestock marketing council chairman Dubat Amey said the drought is not threatening livelihoods.Ali said although the national government was distributing relief food, it was mainly doing it in urban centres and even the little it is distributing is not enough.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s high time other aid agencies joined hands with the government and upscale the distribution of relief food especially in rural setups where the population has been badly affected,&rdquo; he said. The MCA said parts of Dadaab and Lagdera subcounties are the most affected and the situation could get worse when schools close later this week.He said the communities depend on the school feeding programme where parents and the communities are allowed to share the food with school children.Amey on his part urged the government to move to villages and organise a properly coordinated programme with chiefs, which will see the badly affected families get assistance.Last month, the National Drought Management Authority said the number of people in need of relief food by the end of February stood at 60 per cent up from 40 per cent.
