Mombasa woman representative Mishi Mboko’s son-in-law was yesterday charged with killing a security guard. Tariq Twalib, 25, was accused of killing Peter Mnyika on March 23 at Koja flats in Majengo area, Mombasa county. He is accused of committing the crime alongside other people who were not before court. He pleaded not guilty and was released on a Sh100,000 bond after the prosecution said it did not have any compelling reasons to block his bail application. Twalib married Mboko’s firstborn and only daughter Hafidha Wakesho on March 11 in a wedding at the Sharks Club in Likoni. The wedding was attended by the top county leadership including Governor Hassan Joho and Kisauni MP Rashid Bedzimba. Twalib is said to have hired goons from Majengo and Old town to kill the guard. Mnyika, attached to TSS security firm, was accosted by the gang after Twalib found his house broken into and Sh1,500 stolen from his wallet. Twalib underwent a mental checkup at the Coast Provincial General Hospital to find out if he was fit to stand trial. The suspect had been detained at Makupa police station.
