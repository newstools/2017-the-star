A 16-year-old girl from Kibugu, Embu county, is being held at Runyenjes police station after lying to a judge. She appeared before resident magistrate Jean Ndengeri on Monday and lied her name was Pamela Mwendwa. The girl had been called as a defence witness by 24-year-old Linet Wawira who is charged with creating a disturbance. Wawira is accused of saying a 55-year-old man and his mother were uncircumcised. The incident happened on August 16 last year. Ndengeri realised the girl was lying after interrogating her. When asked for her motherâ€™s contacts, the girl said she does not have a mobile phone. The magistrate ordered the girl held until her parents are found. Ndengeri directed the girl brought to court today with documents to determine her true identity.
