Nairobi Governor aspirants Mike Sonko (pictured) and Bishop Margaret Wanjiru&rsquo;s reluctance to name running mates ahead of the Jubilee Party nominations has raised eye brows in Jubilee, and especially among their supporters. Their key rival Peter Kenneth has picked Linet Mirehane, a former councillor. But Sonko and Wanjiru &mdash; the only survivors of Team Nairobi after Johnson Sakaja and Dennis Waweru bowed out &mdash; have been viewed as walking the tight rope of choosing a running mate in a cosmopolitan city.***** A woman aspirant in Garissa county is organising rallies and transporting supporters from Township constituency to her constituency to gather a sizeable crowd since residents are not willing to attend her functions. Voters suspect the pictures might be used to solicit campaign cash from unsuspecting foreign donors. The aspirant has tremendously lost ground and is desperate for support. ***** Two weeks after President Uhuru Kenyatta reshuffled some PSs, staff at a Ministry in Nairobi&rsquo;s Community area on Friday organised a party to celebrate the exit of their former boss. The celebrations at a club in Upper Hill started at 5pm till late. Our mole in the ministry said the PS is said to have been an arrogant dictator. For the three years in the ministry, she changed 12 receptionists and fired 10 personal assistants.***** The editor of a weekly tabloid has turned into a sex pest overnight. The man in his late 30s exploits his position for sexual favours from beauties, including married women. He &ldquo;investigates&rdquo; and publishes negative stories about those who turn down his sexual advances. The man is said to have an insatiable appetite for bedroom &ldquo;gymnastics&rdquo;. In the last two months, he has published stories of women who have rejected his advances. Recently, the wife of a director in the media company was tipped off by an employee. She wrote to the top managers demanding the man be fired. He has been nicknamed the chairman of media chapter of Mafisi Sacco (an informal reference for men with an appetite for women).***** A group of wealthy city businessmen and politicians have opened a Whatsapp group and recruited five hookers. Their tasks are limited to sharing photos of beauties and socialites. The men then discuss the women&rsquo;s features before picking their choice. One of the group administrators said the members comprise the who-is-who in society and the business world. Sometimes they fight over the socialites whose photos are shared in the social media platform. But the rule is first come first served.
