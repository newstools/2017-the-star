Mediheal Group of hospitals CEO Dr Swarrup Mishra has dismissed claims by his rivals he does not deserve to be elected Kesses MP because he is not a Kalenjin.Mishra, who is running on the Jubilee ticket, said he has lived in Uasin Gishu for 20 years and is &ldquo;more Kalenjin than some of my rivals&rdquo;.&ldquo;I have lived within this community and worked with them more than most of my rivals. It&rsquo;s not my fault I was born in India. Given a second chance, I would choose to be born a Nandi,&rdquo; he said yesterday.Mishra, popularly known as Kiprop, said the people of Kesses have accepted him.There have been claims Mishra may not qualify to vie because he was issued a Kenyan ID just four years ago. But his passport was issued 15 years ago. Mishra faces a tough battle to win the Jubilee ticket in what appears to be a two-horse race between him and prominent lawyer Allan Kosgey, a son of former minister Henry Kosgey.Mishra has defended his spending on campaigns. He is said to have a Sh200 million budget. Yesterday, Mishra donated a pickup worth about Sh3 million to women&rsquo;s groups at Matharu.
