The Kenya Rugby Union fears that the 50 per cent taxation imposed on betting firms by the government will negatively impact on sports sponsorships in the country.Last year, the KRU signed a sponsorship package with SportPesa totaling Sh600 million for five years and the union feels they will be at a loss if the directive by Finance Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich earlier this month is executed.In a statement KRU chief executive officer Ronald Bukusi said the sponsorship enables the federation to develop and implement programs over the short and long terms while remaining accountable to all its stakeholders. He observed that scaling back of funding from betting companies, as intended in the proposed National Sports, Culture and Arts fund will be defeatist and retrogressive to the growth of the game and sport in general.&ldquo;Rugby is the fastest growing team sport in the country, a feat that could not have been achieved without the implementation of these programs. We have witnessed players and teams from areas and schools previously viewed as non-traditional rugby playing zones taking up the sport and even breaking into the national squads and winning national titles,&rdquo; said Bukusi.He added that the increased uptake of the game has led to increased opportunities within the sport including coaches, physiotherapists, conditioning coaches, analysts, kit suppliers, food vendors, event managers and kit suppliers.
