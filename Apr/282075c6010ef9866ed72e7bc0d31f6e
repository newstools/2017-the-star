A section of ODM leaders from Kisumu have rejected county elections board members "handpicked" by Nyando MP Fred Outa and Kisumu Senator Anyang' Nyong'o.Led by Governor Jack Ranguma, the leaders said board members are compromised due to links with Outa and Nyong'o who intend to run for the Senate and Governor seats respectively.On Saturday, Ranguma and MPs Onyango Koyoo (Muhoroni) and Shakeel Shabbir (Kisumu East) issued a statement calling for the board's disbandment.Others were MCAs Nerea Okombo (Manyatta) Maurice Aloo (Ahero) and Samuel Ong&rsquo;ow (Masogo/Nyang&rsquo;oma), as well as Kisumu East MP hopeful John Oselu and Senator aspirant Israel Kodiaga.They said board member Geoffrey Yogo is a "known confidant, trusted friend, kinsman and advocate" of Outa, having represented him in a number of court cases and served as CDF treasurer in Nyando.&ldquo;Accordingly, Yogo&rsquo;s ability to be an impartial referee is seriously compromised. Besides, Yogo has in the past been known to be a strong supporter and campaigner for [Kisumu Senator Anyang'] Nyong&rsquo;o and Outa,&rdquo; the statement read.They cited an incident on November 4, 2016 at Kibuye market when Yogo publicly declared that the governor position belongs to Nyong&rsquo;o and that other candidates must not waste their time.The leaders noted that another board member and ODM county chair Kennedy Ajwang' is a "great supporter" of Nyong'o.They also said the third board member Monica Akong&rsquo;o is part of Nyong&rsquo;o&rsquo;s campaign machinery.Read: Ranguma way ahead of Nyong&rsquo;o, Tifa poll showThey want the party to come clean on issues pertaining to ballot papers."We have noted and rejected the manipulation of the elections process by Nyong'o and Ayiecho Olweny as witnessed in a meeting called at Royal City, Nyamasaria," the statement added.They accused Olweny of arm-twisting the Muhoroni constituency board to omit a name from the list of confirmed party candidates."The whole board cannot be trusted to preside over ODM nominations," the statement read.They said, given the history of the "culprits", they believe some ballot papers have been printed only awaiting to be stuffed during nominations.Read: ODM nominations will be done through secret ballot, says elections boardThe leaders want the merging of polling stations with the full participation of all aspirants, rather than "in some backroom by faceless characters".They also asked for a new board with persons of integrity drawn from neighbouring counties, specifically the Western region.The aspirants noted that for the avoidance of doubt, the leaders promised to seek legal redress should ODM continue in "its vintage style of prevarication, manipulation and intimidation".&ldquo;Having been on the fore front of the campaigns for an impartial IEBC, free and transparent general elections, ODM must therefore hold credible nominations. Kenyans are watching and history will judge us harshly if we do not walk our talk as ODM members,&rdquo; the statement continued. The Star could not reach Nyong'o and Outa for comments as their phone went unanswered.
