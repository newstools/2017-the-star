National champions Kenya Pipeline extended their good run in the ongoing women's African Club Championship with a deserved 3-0 (26-24,25-23,25-16) win against Sonatrach of Algeria to qualify for the quarter-final spot at the Ksar Hellal Janmel Hall in Monastir, Tunisia on Saturday.The side coached by Japtheth Munala had won against Army Patrotic of Rwanda in their first pool 'C' match on Friday before extending the good form against the North Africans on Saturday. Pipeline who bagged Bronze Medal in last edition held in Tunis, Tunisia will rest on Sunday and Monday before returning to wrap up their group stage matches with a tie against unpredictable Bafia of Cameroon on Tuesday.Pipeline coach Munala made one change to the lineup that won against APR of Rwanda as he brought in regular Monica Biama in place of Leonida Kasaya.Munala retained celebrity setter Janet Wanja, on form Noel Murambi, Esther Wangeci, Kenya Volleyball Federation national league most valuable player and team captain Triza Atuka, the swift Violet Makuto and Agripinna Kundu Libero for the clash and they lived up to the billing.In a tightly contested first set, Pipeline trailed Sonatrach in the better part of play with the North Africans leading 8-6 and 16-14 in the first and second technical time outs.Both teams would then tie at 22 and 23 before Wanja&rsquo;s razor-blade serving made all the difference as pipeline bagged the first set 26-24.The second set was equally competitive, but Pipeline chose to fight from the front, thanks to powerful spikes from Murambi, to lead 8-3 and 15-16 going into the second technical time out.Pipeline would then stall thanks to mishap in backcourt defense as North Africans closed gap before they tied at 21.Wangeci however saved them blushes by earning points with good service to open a two point lead and Pipeline never looked back as they run away with the set 25-23.Pipeline had an upper hand in the third set as they led 8-5, 6-10 thanks to Makuto and Murambi&rsquo;s water tight blocks.The good combination of Atuka, Wangeci and Monica upfront would see Pipeline bag good points coupled with poor services from their opponents as they led 12-8 and 15-12.Destined for the win, Murambi scored at will with her ever hard-hitting spikes with Sonatrach looking beaten as Pipeline comfortably won the third set 25-16.Kenya&rsquo;s other representatives, Kenya Prisons were scheduled to play hosts Marsa later on Saturday night after they had succumbed to champions Al Ahly of Egypt 3-1(25-14,25-21,17-25 and 25-16) in their opening pool 'B' match on Friday night.
