Meru Senator Kiraitu Murungi has said he will show Governor Peter Munya &lsquo;dust&rsquo; on August 8, despite recent polls that show Munya would get more votes.An Infotrak survey released early this month showed 41.1 per cent of residents interviewed support Munya while 29.9 per cent back Kiraitu.Kiraitu said Munya should not be cheated by the Infotrak poll, because the same firm ranked Kiambu Governor William Kabogo as the preferred candidate in his county, yet he lost the Jubilee primaries.&ldquo;The percentage they gave Kabogo is the same percentage they gave Munya and they gave me a percentage equivalent to Waititu&rsquo;s. Going by that record, we are going to witness the same in Meru,&rdquo; he said.Kiraitu continued, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m working very hard to show him dust in August. I&rsquo;m going to do better than Ferdinand Waititu did in Kiambu.&rdquo;He spoke to journalists at his home in Nkubu, South Imenti, on Thursday.Kiraitu said Munya&rsquo;s leadership is characterised by arrogance and dictatorship.He said Munya does not consult anyone about the county&rsquo;s affairs.&ldquo;The kind of leadership Munya exercises has been overtaken by time. He is like Kamuzu Banda and Mobutu Sese Seko. If he dreams something, he believes it should be implemented without subjects questioning anything. That&rsquo;s why he must go. If elected, I will consult, unlike arrogant Munya,&rdquo; Kiraitu said on Monday last week.He said Kenyans have spoken in the concluded primaries and &ldquo;have no time for arrogant, corrupt leaders who don&rsquo;t listen to them&rdquo;.&ldquo;The electorate has changed and these kind of people are being shown the door. The days of running a one-man show are fading fast and we are going to see more changes,&rdquo; Kiraitu said.He urged aspirants who feel shortchanged to appeal to the Jubilee Elections Board instead of decamping.Kiraitu said, &ldquo;Let them not malign the party. This is still our home and I plead with them to stay because we need each other.&rdquo;
