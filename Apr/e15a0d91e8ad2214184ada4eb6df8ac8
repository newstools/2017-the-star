Outdated vaccine supply and distribution systems are delaying and limiting the impact of vaccines.A news article published in Vaccine journal says the poor supply chain places the health of millions of people at risk.The researchers say one in every three countries in the world experiences at least one stockout of at least one vaccine for at least one month.Nineteen to 38 per cent of vaccines worldwide are accidentally exposed to freezing temperatures, potentially compromising the potency of these vaccines.The problem is most pronounced in sub-Saharan Africa, where 38 per cent of countries, including Kenya, have experienced the stockouts.Rampant shortage of the BCG vaccine for tuberculosis was reported in Kenya in 2015 and 2016. This was attributed to delays by manufacturers and procurement agencies, rather than the country&rsquo;s distribution systems.Kenya&rsquo;s vaccine supply chain is mostly fragmented, with clinics and hospitals mainly organising their collections.&ldquo;There are too many places in the world where vaccines are still not reaching the people who need them most,&rdquo; says Steve Davis.He is the head of the global health nonprofit Path, which coordinated the publication of the current special edition of the journal.The articles identify problems and point solutions that countries can employ to modernise immunisation supply chains. A 2013 study in the Vaccine journal showed it costs an average Sh34 to deliver a single dose of vaccine in Kenya, which is considered expensive. However, Kenya&rsquo;s vaccine coverage is impressive with the polio vaccine, for instance, reaching more than 93 per cent of the intended recipients in the last three years.&ldquo;We must act to close the global immunisation gap,&rdquo; said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa.&ldquo;Achieving the Global Vaccine Action Plan goal of universal access to immunisation by 2020 would benefit the health of millions of Africans.&rdquo;Immunisation supply chains &mdash; staff, equipment, vehicles and data needed to get vaccines to the people who need them &mdash; were first developed in the late 1970s.
