Two children died in house fires set by suspected police officers during security operations in Tiaty subcounty, Baringo, on Sunday.Residents claimed the heavily armed gunmen were members of the police service and Kenya Police Reservists (KPR) from Kagir and Yatya stations in Baringo North.The Star could not verify this by press time.Baringo county security bosses who were reached for comment did not give details and did not want to be named.&ldquo;I know you want to write a story...this may or may not be true,&rdquo; one told the reporter.More on this: Four armed Pokots gunned down at burial of 10 Baringo bandit attacks victimsThe children were aged two and four.Their father Lobutakona Adomoi said he left them in the house that morning but was called back at 10am and informed of the fire."I took a boda boda from Chemolingot centre and found that my two grass-touched houses had already been reduced to ashes. My children were inside," Adomoi said.He added that his 30 goats were missing.Ripko MCA Daniel Tuwit said the gunmen landed in nine lorries and two armoured police carriers.Twit said they were armed and that some wore tyre sandals. "...so they could not be Kenya Defense Forces (KDF) soldiers," he said adding no guns were seized during the operation."KDF would have carried out a more organised operation than this one in which two children were burned and property and livestock taken away."The ward representative said he had never witnessed that type of destruction.Witnesses said the attackers burned more than 100 houses as they sought to flush out armed Pokot bandits who have killed and injured many people in months of violence.They said more than 2,000 of them were displaced in the 5am - 11am operation that took place in East Pokot's Lochomin, Seretion and Kositei villages.The gunmen caused massive destruction, stole property and took more than 4,000 goats in their lorries. The animals are believed to have been taken across the North Baringo border.An additional 255 police reservists were deployed to Kerio Valley in February to step up the war against bandits wreaking havoc in the area.Deputy President William Ruto installed the reservists at Chesongoch, Marakwet East on Monday, assuring residents they will restore calm.West Pokot Senator John Lonyangapou opposed the order for 2,400 more to be deployed saying they may take sides in efforts to end fighting between Pokots and Marakwets.&ldquo;It is like hiring a militia group to target one community. The DP has failed to involve the Pokot community in efforts to resolve the conflict in Kerio Valley," said Lonyangapuo.The Senator also said the reservists were not vetted.More on this: Ruto installs 255 reservists as state steps up war against Kerio Valley banditsAlso read: Lonyangapuo likens Ruto's reservists to militia targeting one communityBy Sunday evening, residents including children were stranded at Seretion centre in East Pokot waiting for humanitarian help.Kenya Red Cross officers had not visited the villages by Monday morning.The incident took place about two days after 40 armed Pokot bandits attacked Kagir in North Baringo subcounty and drove away more than 300 goats towards Kashokon village in Tiaty.
