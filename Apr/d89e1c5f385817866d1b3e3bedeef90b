Seven aspirants have expressed their interest in running for Vihiga senator, even as incumbent George Khaniri pleaded with residents to reelect him, then he will later run for President.Khaniri has been in politics for 25 years. For two decades he served as MP for Hamisi.All the aspirants have said Khaniri&rsquo;s poor development record has prompted them to vie for the post.Dr Jairus Amayi, a 2013 governor candidate, is among the hopefuls.Amayi, who contested for governor on the UDF ticket, came third after Governor Moses Akaranga and Kennedy Butiko.Amayi said he will run on the ticket of Musalia Mudavadi&rsquo;s current party, ANC, the same vehicle Khaniri wants to use to defend his seat.&ldquo;All we want is to bring development to our people. That has been the clarion call by our people. I will be seeking the senator seat to push for development at the grassroots,&rdquo; Amayi said.Jubilee Party aspirant Prof Ralph Kenya said Khaniri is the loudest speaker outside Parliament.He said he gave Khaniri a well-prepared report on the Maseno boundary issue but Khaniri never tabled it.Kenya will face 27-year-old political scientist Aggrey Ndeda in the Jubilee primaries this month.Others running for the senator post are Julius Saisi, Dr Billy Nyonje and Maurice Magomere.Saisi and Magomere come from Tiriki, Khaniri&rsquo;s home, while Dr Nyonje comes from Luanda.Football Kenya Federation Western branch representative Tony Kweya will also vie for the post.He said Vihiga needs a vibrant person who will table Bills in the House.In 2013, there was an arrangement that the Tiriki community takes the senator position, a plan that could be rekindled ahead of the August polls.The 2013 plan, if reintroduced, would dislodge Kenya, Amayi, Kweya, Ndeda and Nyonje&rsquo;s candidature.Khaniri said he has managed to stay in power for more than two decades because of his development track record.He asked his competitors from his tribe to consider running for other seats that are not held by the Tiriki.&ldquo;If there is any Tiriki seeking a political seat, tell him to seek that which we don&rsquo;t have such as the governor or deputy governor posts. We already have the Senate seat,&rdquo; Khaniri said.However, Saisi and Magomere insist they will run for senator.
