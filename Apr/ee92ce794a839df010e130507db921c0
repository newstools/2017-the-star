Teachers in Elgeyo Marakwet county on Friday protested against the alleged grabbing of 100 acres of prime land in Eldoret. The protests were triggered by the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital&rsquo;s move to advertise invitations for bids to build a modern health facility on the land in Eldoret&rsquo;s Block 10. Led by Keiyo Knut secretary Musa Busienei, they said they bought the land from the NSSF in 2004 for Sh52 million, but Kenya Prisons and the MTRH later laid claim to it. He accused the National Land Commission of establishing a &lsquo;kangaroo court&rsquo; and coercing teachers to withdraw a case at the Lands and Environment Court in Eldoret. Keiyo teachers, Kenya Prisons and the MTRH have been embroiled in a protracted legal battle over the land since 2006. Busienei said teachers have documents to prove ownership. Governor Alex Tolgos promised to support the teachers.
