The election was free and fair. This is the voice of Nakuru residents speaking loud and clear,&rdquo; Kinyanjui said on Friday.He is making a second attempt to clinch the governor&rsquo;s seat after he lost in 2013. Kinyanjui has been accusing Mbugua&rsquo;s administration of mismanaging resources.But Mbugua dismissed the allegations, saying Kinyanjui is a perennial loser. The huge margin after tallying is seen as a protest by voters to have a new leader in office.Some residents have accused Mbugua of not fulfilling the promises he made in the run-up to the 2013 General Election.&ldquo;He promised development projects and to change Nakuru to a better place. There are more than 7,000 employees of the county and most of the money that could be used in development is used to pay their salaries,&rdquo; resident Mary Njoki said.In his victory speech, Kinyanjui urged Nakuru leaders to unite and ensure residents vote for Jubilee in August. &ldquo;We no longer have numerous aspirants,&rdquo; he said. Kinyanjui thanked residents for nominating women, including Susan Kihika (Senate), Jane Kihara (Naivasha MP) and Charity Gathambi (Njoro MP).On Friday, Mbugua dismissed the nomination outcome, citing irregularities. He claimed in some stations, the number of cast votes exceeded the number of registered voters.
