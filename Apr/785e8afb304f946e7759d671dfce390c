More than 10,000 face starvation in Tiaty, Baringo county, as Pokot elders call for peace talks to end banditry attacks.Residents have resorted to eating bitter wild fruits known as Soruch and slaughtering emaciated animals.A joint security operation is going on in the area.Elder Yudah Losutan yesterday told the Star the hunger is getting worse by the day.He urged elders and the Church from the neighbouring Tugen, Marakwet and Ilchamus to engage in the peace talks. &ldquo;We all want armed bandits flushed out, but there is also need for peace talks to salvage the lives of more 10,000 people of Tiaty,&rdquo; Losutan said.He said the hunger-stricken Pokots have not known peace since the killing of Loyamorok MCA Kibet Cheretei and Tiaty MP aspirant Pepe Kitambaa on 18 February.Losutan said the elderly and children are the worst-hit by the drought and insecurity. Others present were Musa Amokon, Bishop Richard Kachepko, Micah Kolem, Archdeacon Canon Chochoi, Bishop Joel Lopeta and former Akoret councillor Omari Kukat.
