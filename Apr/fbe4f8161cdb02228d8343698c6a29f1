The Garissa government leased seven ambulances from the Kenya Red Cross Society &mdash; at Sh600,000 each a month &mdash; because it faced a health crisis and many emergencies.Former county medical services director Abbey Sheikh said leasing was the best option in 2014.He was testifying in the trial of Governor Nathif Jama and six former members of his tender committee charged with irregularly leasing ambulances.Abbey said there was dire and urgent need for referral services due to the high child-maternal mortality rate.He also said there were many emergencies, including terrorism, which was at its peak.&ldquo;We needed ambulance services like yesterday. Mothers and children were dying like antelopes in the bush,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Leasing was the easiest and convenient way to address this health crisis.&rdquo;Abbey said his team had carried out a five-year situation analysis backed by a strategic healthcare plan. All information was captured, including the need for ambulance services, he said. &ldquo;Our aim was to provide the highest attainable health services, including reproductive health and emergency services to our people, who were suffering especially in the remote areas. That one we achieved,&rdquo; he said. On Tuesday Kenya Red Cross secretary general Abass Gullet said his role as chairman of emergency medical services was oversight. He said the EMS is an independent entity with a managing director and a team under him in charge of the day-to-day running of the organisation.
