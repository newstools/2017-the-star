Education CS Fred Matiang'i has stopped Kenyan universities from opening satellite campuses and said those in operation must be audited afresh.Matiang'i has also closed a Kenyan satellite campus in Rwanda saying it was opened illegally. He did not name the university but Kenyan institutions with campuses in the country include JKUAT and Kenyatta University."Opening the satellite campuses waters down standards," the CS known for tough reforms told varsity chiefs in Naivasha on Monday.Matiang'i reported that Kenya needs at least 1,000 PhD's to effectively drive academics and research in institutions."The varsities audit revealed ineligible students were admitted to pursue degrees and that honorary degrees were given to undeserving cases," he said.Regarding alleged cases of sodomy at Maseno University, the Cabinet Secretary said investigations will be carried out as this is unacceptable."I will demand investigation at Maseno over claims of rape and fighting among students in halls. We cannot condone some of the carelessness we see in our universities," he said.Former principal Paul Otula was interdicted on March 14 over the allegations. This followed investigations into claims by a 16-year-old student that he had been sodomised by seniors at the school.The boy's sister posted the allegations on social media, indicating that the brother was abused by form three and four boys but the school management did not inform them.Otula denied claims the boy was sodomised.Read: Police, Education officials probe &lsquo;gang rape&rsquo; of boy
