We don't want lawyers and magistrates' nonsense. This is not a courtroom)'," he said.Muriuki said the officer shoved him out of his office and told him he will shoot him if he spots him in Maua again.He said he tried to book the incident at the police station but officers declined. &ldquo;I also made a complain to the county commander but no action has been taken,&rdquo; he said.Muriuki has written to the LSK and Ipoa.
