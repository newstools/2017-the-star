Garissa Township MP Aden Duale has denied claims he is influencing the hiring of IEBC election officials in his constituency.His opponent Farah Maalim made the claims last week in a tweet.Part of the tweet said, &ldquo;Duale gave a list of returning officers and presiding officers to the IEBC. Same officers rigged [for] him in 2013. Not this time.&rdquo;Garissa county elections&rsquo; board coordinator Saadi Noor has dismissed the allegations.He said no politicians will push the commission to have their way, no matter the position they hold.Addressing supporters in Bula Waberi location in the outskirts of Garissa town, Duale said his rival has already sensed defeat.&ldquo;I want to assure him that I will beat him by a huge margin, numbers don&rsquo;t lie. I am planning the stage for his political graveyard,&rdquo; he said.Duale added, &ldquo;The more than 53,000 registered voters are my votes. He has no votes. His votes are in Lagdera. How do I rig my own votes?&rdquo;He said Maalim is a political broker because he changes parties &ldquo;like nobody&rsquo;s business&rdquo;. &ldquo;The people of Garissa have invested in my leadership, which is the home of development,&rdquo; Duale said.He said he is confident he will retain his seat, adding that the people of Garissa will vote for him based on his performance in the 10 years he has represented them.The National Assembly majority leader said he has put the CDF money into good use, which led to his constituency being voted as the best in managing the kitty.
