IsNational Assembly majority leader Aden Duale a master of doublespeak when it comes to defending Parliament&rsquo;s independence? Duale and the majority of MPs have been attacking the courts whenever judges issue orders stopping or directing that they legislate particular laws. Last month, Duale led the House in bashing a High Court judge for directing the MPs ensure the contentious two-thirds gender rule is legislated within 60 days. The outspoken, no-nonsense Garissa Township MP told off the judge that he cannot dictate what Parliament should do. He even threw the ball to the next Parliament to implement the gender principle law. What is shocking is his sudden change of mind. Bowing to pressure from the executive, he now says the House will prioritise the gender rule debate when they resume from recess next month. This is after President Uhuru Kenyatta recently told MPs to pass the law. Why didn&rsquo;t Duale bash Uhuru in defending Parliament&rsquo;s independence?****** IT seems some aspirants have colluded with the police to campaign beyond the stipulated times.

Reason? It is reported that most of them have been left out in a preferred list prepared by a top party member. A mole has whispered to Corridors that not more than 15 of the 41 sitting ward reps elected on the party ticket have made it to the list. The senior top ODM member is said to be only interested in retaining those who have been loyal to Baba (Raila Odinga)..
