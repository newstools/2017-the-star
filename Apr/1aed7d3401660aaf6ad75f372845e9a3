Some ODM aspirants have clarified that the party did not issue direct tickets but nomination certificates to unopposed candidates.Direct tickets for aspirants are issued to handpicked and preferred aspirants to participate in an election without subjecting them to primaries despite having challenges.ODM leader Raila Odinga, last Monday gave certificates to over 400 people who were sole aspirants for the party&rsquo;s ticket for various seats in the August 8 polls.Some of the beneficiaries came out guns blazing on Friday blaming Jubilee for perpetuating a narrative aimed at projecting the party as non-democratic.Kisii governor James Ongwae and nominated senator Janet Ong&rsquo;era said they were prepared to face primaries had competitors come forth. &ldquo;This issue has been misconstrued as part of the Jubilee propaganda to paint the party negatively. I had nobody challenging me for the ODM ticket for the Kisii Governor seat,&rdquo; said Ongwae.&ldquo;I would have wished to face some competition, but until the party closed the submissions from aspirants, nobody had come forth,&rdquo; the county chief said.Ongwae was among the seven ODM governors who were given their nomination certificates because they did not have other aspirants challenging them for the ticket.Ong&rsquo;era who is running for the Kisii women representative position on an ODM ticket accused Jubilee of feigning ignorance.&ldquo;The party gave me a certificate to go and contest because i was unchallenged, in this case where were competitors? I am shocked at the level of ignorance by our critics,&rdquo; she said.Ong&rsquo;era challenged Jubilee to concentrate on its internal issues instead of meddling in matters touching on other parties.Read: [VIDEO] Ongoro narrates ordeals at ODM, claims Kajwang' after her life Westlands MP Tim Wanyonyi said the process was transparent as nobody within the party has raised complaints.
