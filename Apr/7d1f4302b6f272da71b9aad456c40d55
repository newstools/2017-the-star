Just a week after Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho recorded a statement with the Directorate of Criminal Investigation over allegations that he forged his secondary school certificate, the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission is now investigating the validity of his primary school certificate.But yesterday, the governor said he is not worried and would not wish to interfere with the investigations.&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been told they have gone to ask for my details at my primary school. It is unfortunate that this drama continues instead of such energies being channelled into meaningful issues of development,&rdquo; Joho told the Star on the phone.&ldquo;I am not worried, let them investigate but my stand will not change.&rdquo;I&rsquo;m Kenyan, I have a birth certificateSpeaking at Mbaraki Sports Club Hall yesterday, he said Jubilee is intent on proving that he is not a Kenyan.He said the EACC demanded that the head teacher call him personally and ask him for some details.&ldquo;They want me to provide them with the PO Box number that was used during my admission in class one. This is not realistic because I was about six or seven years old then. How do they expect me to even know that?&rdquo; Joho said.He said Jubilee is planning to claim that he was not born in Kenya.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m prepared for them. They can even go to my nursery school and ask about my details. On birth certificate I&rsquo;m a Kenyan like Uhuru Kenyatta,&rdquo; Joho said.He was at the launch of the ODM People Living With Disability League, which will be campaigning for his reelection.Proud of my gradeJoho is also accused of forging his form four certificate to gain entry into the University of Nairobi. He is said to have presented a certificate showing that he got a C+ in his KCSE exam.The governor has come out to publicly say that he scored a D- (minus) and is very proud of it.Joho had earlier said he sat his KCSE in 1993 and not 1992, as indicated in the allegedly forged 1992 certificate that showed he had a C+, an entry mark for university education.The EACC has written a letter to Tom Mboya Primary School, where the governor sat his KCPE exam in 1989, demanding relevant information about him.In a letter dated March 28, EACC deputy CEO Michael Mubea asked the head teacher to provide the commission with Joho&rsquo;s information.&ldquo;The commission is informed that Ali Hassan Joho was a pupil at Tom Mboya Primary School and sat the primary school examination sometimes in or before the year 1989,&rdquo; the letter states.&ldquo;To facilitate our investigation, kindly furnish us with certified copies of the following information and documents: Whether the above named person was enrolled in your institution, the enrolment particular of the student and whether the pupil sat KCPE in the said school and grade obtained.&rdquo;The EACC also asked for the school completion certificate.On Wednesday, the EACC officers arrived at Tom Mboya Primary School at around 9am and held a meeting with the head teacher.&ldquo;They left immediately after presenting their letter to the head teacher. The head teacher is in his office trying to compile his report,&rdquo; one of the people around the school said.The head teacher declined to comment on the matter.He said he would complete his report by the afternoon and send it to the EACC.Dirty Joho-Jubilee warJoho, through his director of communication Richard Chacha, had earlier said he is expecting the war between him and the Jubilee administration to get &ldquo;dirtier&rdquo;.&ldquo;We are expecting this [fight] to get dirtier and we are prepared for it. Let them go to even the nursery school. They should not leave any stone unturned until they are satisfied,&rdquo; Chacha said.The embattled Mombasa governor&rsquo;s woes range from his security being withdrawn, KRA having his bank accounts investigated and frozen, his family business of Container Freight Stations being shut down and, among the latest, KRA claiming he owes the taxman millions of shillings in unpaid taxes.On March 13, he was also barred from attending the relaunch of the Mtongwe ferry services, with President Uhuru Kenyatta saying he will &lsquo;deal&rsquo; with the governor, who has been seen as a leader who questions and criticises the President.Joho also claimed that Jubilee is taking credit for projects initiated years ago under other regimes and by other donor partners.
