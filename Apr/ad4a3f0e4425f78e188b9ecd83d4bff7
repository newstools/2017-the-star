Auditor General Edward Ouko is on the spot for failing to submit reports on his operations to President Uhuru Kenyatta as required under the Constitution.Chief of Staff and Head of the Public Service Joseph Kinyua told a parliamentary committee Ouko has also not presented to the National Assembly briefs on his activities.The Constitution requires Ouko to submit annual reports on his activities to the Head of State and the clerk of the National Assembly.The nonsubmission details emerged in a letter by Kinyua to the Finance Committee, tabled in the House in a progress update report regarding the petition for the removal of Ouko (pictured) from Office.The hearing of the petition was suspended by House Speaker Justin Muturi folowing a court order barring the committee from processing the petition until a case filed by Ouko is heard and determined.The letter by Kinyua offered proof the petition filed by Emmanuel Mwagonah met the requisite threshold required in the law.&ldquo;Although the legal requirement for reporting to the President is clear, records at the executive Office of the President do not show the Auditor General as having ever submitted any such report to the President,&rdquo; Kinyua said.Ouko has been in office since August 2011 and is expected to leave next year after serving one nonrenewable term of six years.Justin Bundi, who was the clerk of the National Assembly when the petition on Ouko was received in the House, said the reports have not been sent to the House.&ldquo;While the Auditor General has regularly been presenting audit reports of other institutions pursuant to Article 229, a perusal of our records indicates that the Office of the Auditor General has not presented any report on his office to Parliament as required by Article 254 (1) of the Constitution,&rdquo; he said in his letter to the committee.Last month, Ouko said Mwagonah&rsquo;s allegations against him are maliciously driven by forces not keen on following due process. Mwagonah accused the auditor of gross violation of the Constitution by failing to submit timely reports to Parliament.He also wants the Auditor General probed for alleged skewed employment and violation of procurement laws.
