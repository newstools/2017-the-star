The High Court in Meru on Thursday dismissed a petition seeking to bar Governor Peter Munya (pictured) from election over audit queries. Judge Alfred Mabeya said businessman Isaiah Kithinji did not exhaust institutional remedies before filing the petition. Kithinji should have first filed a complaint before the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission before coming to court, he said. The matter is already being probed by the EACC.
