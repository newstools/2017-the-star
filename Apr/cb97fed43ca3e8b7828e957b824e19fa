Governor Hassan Joho will be prosecuted and jailed if NASA forms the next government, Mombasa Senator Hassan Omar (pictured) said yesterday.He said Joho should step aside and allow investigations into allegations of forgery of his KCSE exam certificate.Omar said NASA will punish impunity. He said forging certificates is shameful and should not be condoned, irrespective of which political side one comes from. &ldquo;I can assure you, after the NASA government takes over, this forgery will be one of the first matters that will go before our criminal jurisdiction. We cannot condone this type of thing,&rdquo; Omar said. He spoke in Mombasa during a press conference at the Renaissance Centre.It will be interesting to see if ODM leader Raila Odinga, should he get the NASA ticket and win the presidency, will lead Joho&rsquo;s prosecution.Joho is Raila&rsquo;s deputy in ODM and his point man at the Coast. Omar&rsquo;s revelation paints a looming deep animosity in NASA. The senator said many politicians seek positions for preservation and impunity.Joho, through aide Richard Chacha, said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s wishful thinking.&rdquo; Police are investigating Joho&rsquo;s KCSE certificate. Early this week two EACC sleuths stormed Tom Mboya Primary School, where Joho said he schooled. Headmaster Babu Suleiman, responded, saying Joho indeed schooled there and sat the KCPE exam in 1988. Suleiman said Joho scored 286 marks.
