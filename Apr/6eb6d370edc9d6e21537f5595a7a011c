Nyeri county will host national Madaraka Day celebrations on June 1 and about 20,000 people are expected.Nyeri is in the heart of Central Kenya region, considered a Jubilee Party stronghold.This will be the third national celebration held by the Jubilee administration outside Nairobi. Earlier events were held in Nakuru and Machakos counties.In December 2015 President Uhuru Kenyatta announced that two of the three national holidays henceforth would be held outside Nairobi. Last year they were to be held in Nakuru and Mombasa. Mombasa was dropped, possibly as a result of the feud between Governor Hassan Joho and the Jubilee administraiton.Instead, Machakos hosted Mashujaa Day on October 20.Jamhuri Day on December 12 is always held in Nairobi.Nyeri is famous for its contributions to the freedom struggle and many Mau Mau fighters were from Nyeri.A high-profile government delegation, which is organising the event, on Tuesday toured Kabiruini ASK Grounds where the event will be held.National Celebrations Committee chairperson Mohammed Barre said Kabiruini is the only Nyeri venue that meets standards to host the event.He said, however, it needs renovation.The team had inspected historic Ruring&rsquo;u Stadium but tall buildings nearby made it unacceptable and posed a security risk.The President and Deputy President William Ruto will lead the celebrations.Barre said they are working closely with the regional coordinator and the county government to ensure infrastructures are in place.Central regional coordinator Naftali Mung&rsquo;athia assured everyone of adequate security.County secretary Alice Wachira said it is a great honour for the area to host a national event. &ldquo;The day is very important to the Nyeri people, given that it is the epitome of the freedom struggle, as well as home to many freedom heroes,&rdquo; she said.Wachira said the event would showcase the county, increase domestic tourism and highlight the county&rsquo;s sacrifices to the freedom struggle.
