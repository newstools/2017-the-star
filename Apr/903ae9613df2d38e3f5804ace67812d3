A report on alcohol and drug abuse has revealed that drug trafficking across the Busia-Uganda border is on the rise, with 89.4 per cent of residents interviewed admitting drugs are trafficked into this country.The report was released by the National Authority for the Campaign Against Alcohol and Drug Abuse at the Busia Agricultural Training Centre on Friday. It says bhang is the most trafficked drug across the porous border.Nacada regional manager for Nyanza and Western Esther Okenye said other commonly smuggled drugs are chang&rsquo;aa and cigarettes, second generation alcohol, miraa and kuber.She said culprits mainly use boda bodas, trucks, private vehicles, persons living with disability, the youth and elderly women to ferry the drugs.The report says problems faced in curbing drug trafficking include corruption among law enforcement officers and lack of harmonised laws between Kenya and Uganda.Others are poor coordination among enforcement officers, porous borders, increase of boda boda riders, high unemployment and lack of common border programmes.Nacada is to launch a pilot survey in Matayos subcounty on prevention science, with emphasis on strengthening families. The programme will start in the next financial year.Okenye said alcohol is generally acceptable in the communities, but urged consumers to take it sparingly, adding that it destroys lives.Deputy Governor Kizito Wangalwa was present. He said Busia will legalise busaa to be sold in licensed outlets so they bar children from access. The survey sampled 698 residents, randomly selected from all sub counties.
