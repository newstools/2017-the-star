Jubilee primaries in Baringo scheduled on Friday have been called off reportedly for lack of ballot materials in the polling centres. County election board chairman Bernard Lotole suspended the exercise until further notice, after residents expressed their displeasure for lack of preparedness. Lotole accused the Jubilee Party top officials of dispatching inadequate voting materials. &ldquo;The party already knew the number of voters on the ground, and yet they supplied fewer poll materials,&rdquo; he said. Lotole appealed for calm as the issue is resolved. Tension was high after protesters demanded release of ballot materials that were still locked up in Kabarnet town, the county headquarters, by 10.30am. &ldquo;I want to cast my vote but I fail to understand what has caused the delay,&rdquo; Ernest Kibet, a voter, said. More than 50 anti-riot police officers were deployed to man the exercise. Aspirants who joined the protestors accused Jubilee and incumbents of trying to rig the nominations. Baringo Central MP hopeful David Kipkerich said they would press on until enough ballot materials are availed for the people to vote.&ldquo;We are sensing some deals are being done in secret by sitting Jubilee leaders to lock us out,&rdquo; he said.
