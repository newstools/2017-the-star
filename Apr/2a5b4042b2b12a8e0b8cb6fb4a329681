Two GSU officers are still reportedly missing following a shootout with bandits in Matweku, near the Laikipia Nature Conservancy, on the Laikipia and Baringo border on Thursday.An officer died from injuries during the shootout. An AP officer was also injured during an attempt to rescue their GSU colleagues.A police source, who sought anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media, told the Nation a contingent of GSU officers was engaged in a fierce shootout with the bandits before the two went missing. They are yet to be found. &ldquo;My colleagues went missing after the attack and have not been traced. I fear they may have been killed after being taken hostage,&rdquo; the source said on the phone.The source further said the suspected bandits fled after the attack, some with gunshot wounds.Laikipia county commissioner Simon Kipkeu, however, denied there were any officers missing, saying he &ldquo;wasn&rsquo;t aware of any missing GSU officers.&rdquo;A top government security official told the Star that the militias are "causing major disruption to security with the aim of disrupting elections which they want delayed".The attack was followed by another on police officers at Ol Maisor Ranch in Laikipia on the same day.A police office died from the injuries.The raids have intensified with the drought, as herders search for pasture and water for their animals. But locals say the violence is also politically motivated.
