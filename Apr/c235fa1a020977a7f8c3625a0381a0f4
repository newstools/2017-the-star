Bungoma Governor Kenneth Lusaka has said the Luhyas will vote for Jubilee, following the unveiling of ODM leader Raila Odinga as the NASA flagbearer.He said on Saturday he is disappointed that two the Luhya presidential hopefuls &mdash; Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula and Musalia Mudavadi &mdash; &ldquo;only got imaginary positions&rdquo;.&ldquo;We, the Luhyas, were 40 per cent of those in the NASA negotiations, yet we&rsquo;ve got posts not in the Constitution,&rdquo; the JP pointman in the Western region said.Lusaka said as JP supporters from the region, they would have supported NASA if it chose one of their own as the standard-bearer. He said the community had three doctors &mdash; Eseli Simiyu, Chris Wamalwa and Boni Khalwale &mdash; in the NASA negotiations, but could not ensure a better deal.&ldquo;The Kambas are crying foul yet they have something protected by the Constitution. What is at stake for us?&rdquo; Lusaka asked.&ldquo;In 2002, Kijana Wamalwa was very bright when he went to negotiate and he said he wanted to be the Vice President. He was not like these two [Mudavadi and Wetang&rsquo;ula], who don&rsquo;t know what they want,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Now Wetang&rsquo;ula will be the Deputy CS after he promised Bungoma people an elephant when he launched his bid in Masinde Muliro Gardens, Kakamega town. He wants to deliver a rabbit. How shameful is that?&rdquo;Lusaka accused Khalwale, Eseli and Wamalwa of letting the community down and told them to apologise and seek forgiveness.He urged the community to vote for Jubilee.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have any grudge with the person they have picked. But Raila did not help us in any way when he was the Prime Minister. He only gave Alfred Khang&rsquo;ati the Internal Security docket,&rdquo; Lusaka said.He said the Uhuru Kenyatta administration has helped Bungoma residents.&ldquo;We asked for a charter for Kibabii University and we got it. We asked for Pan Paper to be revived and the first phase is up and operational. We asked for the tarmacking of Chwele-Lwakhakha and Musikoma Mungachi-Buyofu roads and construction is ongoing,&rdquo; the county boss said.Lusaka added that the JP administration has initiated many development projects in Western. He criticised Governor Isaac Rutto for joining NASA, saying it is a waste of time.
