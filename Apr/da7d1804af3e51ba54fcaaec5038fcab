Former Vice President Moody Awori yesterday confirmed he oversaw the purchase of the Sh8 billion Karen land 33 years ago.Awori told trial judge Elijah Obaga of the Milimani Environment and Lands Court that he was a director of Muchanga Investment Ltd when the land was transferred from Barclays Bank.Lawyer Cecil Miller represents Muchanga in the case. Awori said he attended a board meeting on April 29, 1983, that resolved to charge the land with Barclays for Sh10.5 million. Lawyer Peter Wena assists Miller in the case.Awori said he and his wife were both directors of Muchanga Ltd together with Da Gama Rose Investments, which used the land title to borrow from Barclays.He identified documents as evidence to support claims by businessman Horatius Da Gama Rose, now deceased, that he purchased the land from Barclays in 1983.Dimitri Da Gama Rose, a general manager with Muchanga Ltd, has since taken his father&rsquo;s place in the case.Awori and his wife Rose Kuyumba are listed as directors of Muchanga in minutes of the board that resolved to extend credit to its holding company, Da Gama Rose Investments.The case has previously been heard by Justice Lucy Gacheru, who has since been transferred. Awori said he was not directly involved in the purchase of the property. He said the matter was brought to them and he is aware that Muchanga purchased the property.The bank said it never had any contract with John Mugo, but instead oversaw the transfer of the land from the original owner, Arnold Bradley, to Horatius. Barclays Director of Legal Services Waweru Mathenge said the lender held the land title as a charge for a loan taken by Rose between 1983 and 1989, when it released a certificate of discharge after he completed servicing the loan.Telesource, a company owned by former NSSF Managing Trustee Jos Konzolo, told the court it acquired the land from one Kamau who purchased it from Bradley on August 24, 1978.Mathenge said the transfer deal between Bradley and Kamau was fraudulent. Muchanga is owned by Rose and has filed the case against Habenga Holdings Ltd, Jina and Telesource. The case continues today.
