Interior CS Joseph Nkaiserry has been sued for extending curfew in Mandera county.A lobby group &ndash; Northern Advocacy Organisation &ndash; says the decision by Nkaiserry (pictured) to extend the curfew for another three months will seriously undermine rights to free movement by people of Mandera.&ldquo;The continuation of the curfew is illegal, unconstitutional and punitive, as the people of Mandera have been denied their fundamental rights to associate and move freely as enshrined in the Constitution,&rdquo; the suit papers indicate.The curfew was first imposed in Mandera town after a terror attack on a guest house on October 25 last year. Twelve non-Muslims were killed.The previous curfew lasted for five months, which the lobby says did not help since no investigations have been conducted and no suspects arrested.The court heard the curfew has severely limited business hours and has caused major losses and derailed the economy. The curfew has also violated residents&rsquo; right to worship because they can&rsquo;t attend evening prayers. &ldquo;The denial of the right to move freely cannot be curtailed in perpetuity,&rdquo; the suit papers read in part.They added: &ldquo; The extended curfew will greatly interfere with the prayer sessions of the muslims in Mandera during the holy month of Ramadhan which commences on or about May 20.&rdquo;The lobby says the state through its security agents should provide security to residents of Mandera during the day and night. It wants the CS and security agents to be restrained from continuing to impose the curfew.
