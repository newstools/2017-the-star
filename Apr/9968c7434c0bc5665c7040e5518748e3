The Council of Governors has expressed concern the Ifmis has not worked since Monday last week, disrupting operations across the 47 counties.In a statement yesterday, the governors said the disruption has affected payments for emergency service delivery, development and workers.&ldquo;The promise was that through Ifmis, county governments will have enhanced efficiency in planning, budgeting, procurement, expenditure management and reporting ensuring prudent disbursement and utilisation of resources,&rdquo; the statement read.The governors accused the national government of duping them, adding that when presented with the system, they were assured it was foolproof, &ldquo;but that is not the case&rdquo;.&ldquo;The Council of Governors views this as a subtle attempt to slow down county governments&rsquo; expenditure as the General Election date draws nearer. Delivery of services to Kenyans cannot, and should not be pegged on elections or any event for that matter,&rdquo; the governors said. This is the second time the system has failed, with the first being in December when Ifmis collpased for two days, halting all operations in the counties, including payment of staff salaries in December 2016.CoG chairman Peter Munya said it is not a good sign for the Integrated Financial Management Information System to break down, given the past problems of password mishandling and misappropriation of funds. Ifmis is a computer system that processes procurement and payments for goods and services bought by national and county government agencies.&ldquo;Something sinister could be going on, yet it is the county leaders who will be blamed,&rdquo; Munya said.The system was meant to enhance financial accountability, but questions were raised over the loss of Sh791 million National Youth Service funds.The county governments have on many occasions blamed the e-procurement system for mishaps, saying they do not have personnel to operate it.
