President Uhuru Kenyatta yesterday told the opposition to prepare for a tough battle in the August general election. Uhuru said NASA co-principals have shown Kenyans they do not have leadership qualities, which is why they have not agreed on the flagbearer. &ldquo;If they have failed to agree on a presidential candidate, alone, how can Kenyans trust them when it came to country&rsquo;s leadership.There are only good at negotiations and criticising,&rdquo; Uhuru said. The President was speaking at Kilgoris town after he opened a public market and unveiled medical equipment at Kilgoris hospital. He also laid the foundation for a level 4 hospital in Emurua Dikirr. Uhuru unveiled medical equipment at Narok County Referral Hospital and commissioned Narok-Sekenani road. &ldquo;The opposition has formed tribal parties and has started to call for negotiations among themselves, which will not help this country. What Kenyans need are services and the Jubilee government has done a lot in development and improving the lives of Kenyans,&rdquo; Uhuru said.He was accompanied by Deputy President William Ruto, Cabinet Secretaries Charles Keter (Energy), Najib Balala (Tourism), Sicily Kariuki (Public Service and Gender Affairs), National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale and Narok Governor Samuel Tunai.
