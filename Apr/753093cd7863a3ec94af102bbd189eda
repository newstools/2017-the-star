Matayos MP Geoffrey Odanga has said he will support Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong during the ODM primaries scheduled for this Friday.Ojaamong will run against Funyula MP Paul Otuoma. &ldquo;After months of soul-searching, I made a decision to support Ojaamong, not because he gave me any cent, but because I want to walk with him in this journey,&rdquo; Odanga said.He spoke at the Agricultural Training Centre on Monday when they met ODM delegates from the constituency.Odanga said although the Busia government has weaknesses, this does not mean it has not done anything in the last four years. &ldquo;There were no roads in most parts of the county since 1963. Many projects have been implemented by the county government. Give Ojaamong and his team enough time to fulfil the dreams of Busia residents,&rdquo; he said.
