Kilifi county leaders allied to Jubilee have asked the government to distribute relief food to residents.Kilifi North MP Gideon Mung&rsquo;aro said they are grateful for the 20,000 metric tonnes of maize seeds and 2,000 bags of fertiliser donated by the national government, but locals remain hungry.&ldquo;These seeds will be kept in the stores because residents here do not have the strength to till their lands. They are hungry and they need food. How can they farm?&rdquo; Mung&rsquo;aro said.He was speaking in the Mwanjama ground, Ruruma ward, Rabai constituency, on Saturday, where Mining CS Dan Kazungu and Agriculture PS Richard Lesiyampe led the distribution exercise.Kazungu represented his Agriculture counterpart Willy Bett who is out of the country.&ldquo;By the time they mature, we are not sure how many people will still be on their feet. There is hunger here. Residents need relief food,&rdquo; said Rabai MCA Kenga Mupe, who is eyeing the Rabai MP seat.
