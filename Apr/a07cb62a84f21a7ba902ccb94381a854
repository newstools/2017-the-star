It was an unforgettable night at Privee in Westlands, Nairobi where Nigerian dancehall-reggae artiste Burna Boy disappointed fans with his below average performance.The venue was full with a massive crowd ready to witness the artiste bring down the house, but that was not to be the case. The night started out quite well with Dj Mfalme and Dj Seme who kept the fully-packed venue entertained for the better part of the night.Burna Boy who had kept the crowd waiting, doubting his appearance, arrived at the venue at 3am.He then got on stage and with G-Money on the decks, he went on to perform snippets of some of his hits like "Pree Me" "Tonight," "Rizzla," "Yawa Dey" and "Soke".At one point, he got the ladies screaming when he took off his T-shirt while performing "All Eyes On Me", but that was not enough to keep the crowd thrilled.The performance which lasted under 30 minutes has since sparked a massive social media uproar with fans expressing their disappointment. Burna Boy has also reacted to the flak directed to him by blocking Kenyans who mention him on twitter.Burna Boy on stage. Photo / Moses MWANGIShaffie Weru poses with DJ Joe Mfalme and a fan.
