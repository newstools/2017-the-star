A 69-year-old man is missing for the second day after he was abducted by unknown men in Nairobi.Family members say Mohamed Mwai, a Nyeri resident, was kidnapped by two men suspected to be police officers on Monday at 11am, as he waited to board a matatu at Coast stage, Kawangware, Nairobi.The father of six had visited his daughter on Sunday, and was heading to the city to see another relative. However, the two men waylaid him and kicked him before handcuffing and bundling him into a waiting grey Subaru.Witnesses said the abductors brandished guns to scare off the public before speeding off.&ldquo;We have gone to all police stations including ATPU but were told our dad is not there. They also don&rsquo;t know the owners of the car. We are anxious and in pain because we don&rsquo;t know his whereabouts,&rdquo; Fatma Yusuf, Mwai&rsquo;s second born daughter told the Star.&ldquo;If they are kidnappers, why should they go for a frail and poor old man?&rdquo; &ldquo;My uncle suffers from several chronic ailments including diabetes, high blood pressure and hernia. We appeal for any information on his whereabouts so we can take care of him,&rdquo; Fatma Athman, a niece said.Before retiring, Mwai was a trustee of the Riadha Mosque-Majengo, and some of its committee members have disappeared mysteriously.In April 4 last year, Dr Abdalla Waititu, a pharmacist at Kagundo Hospital, was abducted at work, and to date his whereabouts are unknown.
