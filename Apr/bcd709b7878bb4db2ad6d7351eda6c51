County governments have received Sh19.1 billion from the World Bank, Danida and Jaica for implementing a transformative health system project focused on reducing maternal and neonatal deaths.The Sh15.6 billion loan from the World Bank will be paid back in 40 years, while Sh4 billion from the Danish International Development Agency and Sh110 million from the Japanese Agency for International Cooperation were given as conditional grant.The universal care project, which will be rolled out on July 1 to September 2021, is also aimed at improving access to quality primary healthcare as well as child and adolescent health services.&ldquo;Eighty-nine per cent of the funds will be used for supporting operation and maintenance costs of primary healthcare facilities to improve access to services. The remaining 11 per cent will be used to strengthen health systems initiatives and programme management,&rdquo; Dr William Muraah said.He is the co-chair of the technical and health committee in the Council of Governors.Muraah said the formula used to disburse the funds will be pegged on the needs of the counties, stressing that counties that have poor indicators of maternal and neonatal deaths will be given more funds.For counties to receive conditional grants, they will first sign a memorandum of understating with the World Bank and the Council of Governors, which binds them to policies stipulated in getting the cash.They must also open special accounts with two mandatory signatories at the Central Bank of Kenya, which will be monitored by the chief finance officer and county health minister to keep track of the performance of the grants.The counties must also have an approved work plan clearly identifying priority areas in reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health services that will be supported by the funds.Twenty-one counties have complied with the regulations and are eligible to receive the grant.According to the 2014 Demographic Health Survey, Kenya recorded 362 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. Neonatal mortality was estimated to be 22 per 1,000 live births annually. &ldquo;This is good support from the donors, but they are also saying that now that we are a middle-income country, we need to invest more in our healthcare,&rdquo; Muraah added.Kisumu Health executive Elizabeth Ogaja added that all counties will develop steering committees to educate their finance departments and governors on what is expected from them and the timelines given to implement the project.&ldquo;By the end of June, we will have completed the expenditure and funds of the first year given to us. The timelines are very strict and if we do not abide by the them, next year&rsquo;s funding could be jeopardised as it has a greater impact on reproductive, maternal, child and adolescent health,&rdquo; she added.
