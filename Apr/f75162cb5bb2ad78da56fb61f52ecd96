ODM deputy party leader Wycliffe Oparanya has said the ongoing party primaries are more credible than past exercises.He said despite isolated cases of malpractices and violence in Busia and Machakos, the process is running smoothly.Oparanya accused the party&rsquo;s National Election Board of causing loopholes in the nominations, leading to chaos in parts of the country.Speaking on Saturday during nominations at Emabole Primary School in Butere, he accused the Kakamega county ODM coordinating election committee of dispatching election materials late to polling stations.&ldquo;Some boxes were open and candidates rejected them. The committee did not organise for sufficient vehicles to dispatch the materials to polling centres on time. Only two vehicles were assigned per constituency and this delayed the arrival of materials to distant polling stations,&rdquo; Oparanya said. He added, &ldquo;Many people failed to vote due to delay in delivery of the materials and opted to attend to other issues.&rdquo; Oparanya said some candidates were involved in transporting the ballot boxes and papers &ldquo;and this affected the credibility of the exercise&rdquo;.He said the party&rsquo;s national leadership had prepared well for the primaries &ldquo;but it seems one person decided to do everything by himself and created problems for the party&rdquo;.&ldquo;Our democracy will only strengthen if we get it right during the party primaries. It&rsquo;s unfortunate when a party gets it wrong at the primaries and citizens end up with the wrong choice because of rigging and stuffing ballot boxes with stolen votes,&rdquo; Oparanya said.He said problems witnessed in Busia and Machakos are not unique to ODM. &ldquo;They have happened in other parties and candidates need to accept and respect the decision of the tribunal,&rdquo; Oparanya said.
