Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga (pictured) has dismissed claims that he visited State House on April 10 to seal a deal with President Uhuru Kenyatta over the sale of Yala Swamp.&ldquo;I have visited State House twice in the presence of all the 47 governors and I&rsquo;m again waiting to visit it when Raila [Odinga] ascends to power after August 8,&rdquo; he said in Bondo on Thursday.&ldquo;My late father was a good friend of President Moi and he used to go to State House, but sometimes dead people appear to people who take a lot of alcohol. So maybe [Gem MP Jakoyo] Midiwo saw my late father in State House and mistook him for me.&rdquo;
