County askaris perpetuate gross violation of human rights against street vendors, commercial sex workers, touts and street urchins.This is reported in a baseline research conducted by the International Commission of Jurists on petty offences and practices affecting populations in Nairobi, Kisumu and Mombasa counties. It implicates the askaris in using excessive force during arrest, and physical and sexual assault of victims.The survey revealed the askaris, in partnership with police, make random arrests based on profiling, without giving reasons, and subject the groups to undignified treatment.&ldquo;Annually, hundreds of thousands of mainly poor, vulnerable Kenyans...face punishment, extortion, deprivation and even violence meted out mainly by police and askaris,&rdquo; the report says.It was released last Thursday during the national conference on decriminalisation and reclassification of petty offences.
