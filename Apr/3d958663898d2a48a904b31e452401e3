The man who wants bhang legalised in Kenya says he wants to undo more than 50 years of colonial injustice.Gwada Ogot, a researcher, writer and political analyst, said bhang was legal until colonialists introduced laws to make it illegal.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s medicine at home. I asked people at home and they said it was always legal, the colonialists came and made it illegal. We are reinstating freedom. If we see value in it that they don&rsquo;t see, it doesn&rsquo;t mean we have to go their way,&rdquo; he said during an interview with Kiss100 yesterday.Kenya grows the highly sought after landrace variety, a purebred sativa known for speedy effects.Smugglers routinely take these seeds to The Netherlands and the US, where a handful of commercial strains have been developed. Ogot said the medicinal and industrial uses of the plant, upon its legalisation, will be of &lsquo;great social and economic gains&rsquo;. He appeared before the Senate last week to argue his case. More than 1,400 Kenyans signed a petition seeking the legalisation of bhang, less than 48 hours after Ogot first presented his case.
