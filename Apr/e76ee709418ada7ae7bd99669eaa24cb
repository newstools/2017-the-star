Former Migori MP Owino Likowa will be the ANC candidate for Migori senator and he moved to the party from ODM, Amani county chairman Lawrence Obang&rsquo;a has said.On Tuesday last week, Likowa, in a press conference in Migori town, dropped out of the ODM race for senator in favour of Migori assembly speaker Gordon Ogolla, after his name was missing from the IEBC gazette notice.But on Sunday evening, Obang&rsquo;a said, &ldquo;We confirm that Likowa will be our senator candidate in Migori county and we are happy we have a seasoned politician who will boost the party in the campaigns to get maximum seats.&rdquo;He said the governor candidate is businessman Jack Okoth from Nyatike constituency and Roseline Ohanya from Awendo constituency will run for woman representative.Obang&rsquo;a said ANC will conduct nominations in Kwa and North Kadem wards, which have two aspirants each.The party postponed nominations for Suna East constituency in which businessman Patrick Odipo Jawaswetta and Tom Hillary will battle for the ticket.&ldquo;Until late, the party headquarters only had Odipo&rsquo;s name for the seat before his opponent raised the concern, which has seen us move it forward indefinitely until a date is picked,&rdquo; Obang&rsquo;a said.Hillary blamed his rival for convincing officials that he had agreed to step down for him &ldquo;after sensing defeat at primaries&rdquo;.
