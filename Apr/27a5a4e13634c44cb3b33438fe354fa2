ODM will have to come up with a Plan B candidate in case Governor Hassan Joho is barred from seeking reelection.Joho has been accused of forging his KCSE exam certificate.ODM&rsquo;s options are limited because of the lack of a vibrant leader in the county. Pundits say this is the time NASA affiliate party Wiper and friendly outfits such as Vibrant Democratic Party could come in handy as the opposition tries to prevent a Jubilee win.The two parties have governor candidates, with Wiper fronting Senator Hassan Omar, while VDP is fielding Nyali MP Hezron Awiti.Joho is among seven governors given direct tickets by ODM.The IEBC said if a candidate is barred from contesting by a court after nominations, the sponsoring party can only be allowed to find a replacement if the primaries timeline has not expired.Joho&rsquo;s lawyer James Orengo obtained orders stopping the police from arresting, charging and prosecuting his client over the certificate question.Joho was questioned by Deputy Inspector General Pius Macharia over his KCSE exam certificate and whether he was admitted at the University of Nairobi on merit.The Star has learnt that five days before Joho was grilled at the DCI headquarters, charges had already been drafted. The quizzing was therefore a formality.Joho also confirmed this when he was released. Charges are usually drafted after quizzing. It&rsquo;s not clear if the file has been forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions for action, though insiders hinted the DPP&rsquo;s report could be ready.The opposition has defended Joho, saying the claims are obscure and cannot stand. Top leaders said there is no plan B because Joho has no case to answer.
