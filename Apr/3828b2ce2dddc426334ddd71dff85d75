Kitui Governor Julius Malombe yesterday said he is sure of winning the Wiper primaries and general election as he is the only visionary candidate and the rest are not.Kitui Senator David Musila and former Lands CS Charity Ngilu are also running for governor.Yesterday, a group of voters said they support Malombe.They were with him at the Medical Training College in Mwingi, after he toured his projects including the Kitui-Migwani-Mwingi road.More than 5,000 residents were at the event.They said they support the governor and will not entrust Kitui leadership to people who have been in power for more than 20 years and have nothing to show apart from criticising Malombe&rsquo;s projects.Mwingi Professionals member Campbell Munyambu said Malombe has outdone his two competitors through his development record in only five years, yet the others have been leaders for more than 20 years and served in very senior offices but Kitui never changed.&ldquo;Now that they can witness developments, they have sleepless nights but rest assured that we are reelecting Malombe with no doubt since we can&rsquo;t trust them at all. Some are even too old for the governor&rsquo;s seat,&rdquo; said Munyambu.Central MCA Benard Sila said Malombe is the only option for Kitui county as he has implemented more than 5,100 projects, including a modern outpatient ward that he officially opened on Friday.
