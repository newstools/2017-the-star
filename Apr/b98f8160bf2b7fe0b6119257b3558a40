Rabai MP William Kamoti has warned state agencies against selective justice in the crackdown on fake education documents held by politicians.On Thursday he challenged the government to query degree certificates acquired by all governor aspirants, not only Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho.Kamoti spoke at Mwanjama Primary School in Rabai. He said if the crackdown is fair, only two candidates would be cleared for governor in Kilifi county.&ldquo;Governor Amason Kingi&rsquo;s education background is known. We know he is a lawyer who graduated from the University of Nairobi. We need an audit of the other candidate&rsquo;s degrees and I can confidently confirm to you that most of them do not have genuine degrees,&rdquo; Kamoti said. Governor candidates in Kilifi are Gabriel Katana, a mathematics professor at Pwani University, Kilifi North MP Gideon Mung&rsquo;aro, who graduated from Gretsa University last year and Kazungu Kambi, who graduated from Baraton University. Kingi urged the government to apply the law equally to candidates in Jubilee and the opposition. &ldquo;If it is true what the MP has said, let the government investigate even these aspirants. We do not want a situation, where only leaders from the opposition are being scrutinised. We want fair play,&rdquo; he said.
