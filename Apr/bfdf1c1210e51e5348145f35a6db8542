Kajiado Governor David Nkedianye has lashed out at his rival Joseph ole Lenku describing him as a "failure" to the country.The Governor who has always been a staunch critic of Lenku said he should not be allowed to "taste" the Kajiado seat in August elections."Ole Lenku is very famous for failing," Nkedianye said when he was interviewed by Citizen on Wednesday."Any person in Mandera, Nakuru or Mombasa will tell you Lenku failed the country. Many are interested in the Kajiado governor seat because I have done so well."President Uhuru Kenyatta fired Lenku as Interior Cabinet Secretary in 2014 after 36 Kenyans were massacred by suspected al Shabaab militants in Mandera.More on this: Uhuru kicks out Ole Lenku and KimaiyoNkedianye said Lenku's running mate is a 30-year-old school leaver who "barely graduated"."A young person with experience can lead but a person who&rsquo;s just graduated...we need to think twice," he said.Nkedianye expressed confidence that he will again in Kajiado and get more votes than before."Many people voted for me in 2013 even though they did not know me," he said.The Governor said he had proven himself worth leading and was ready to continue with his development projects."...and I know more people from the Kikuyu community will vote for me. Where Lenku comes from, I have more votes than he does. Kajiado people know my track record," he said.Noting voters look at the track record, credibility and the trust they have on an individual, he said he did not become county chief because of his clan."I received the blessing of an age group of elders from different clans, not my kin alone," he said, adding nobody marries from their own clan or sub-clan. "We are one; we should not be seen as divisive."On April 3, Nkedianye hit out at Lenku describing as &ldquo;sorry&rdquo; his dreams to unseat him. He said Lenku &ldquo;squandered&rdquo; all the opportunities given to him by the Jubilee administration during his time as CS.Nkedianye also said at the time that Lenku has no moral standing to run for office.&ldquo;I hope what I am hearing about Lenku&rsquo;s bid for Governor is just a rumour because he is a disaster who should be avoided at all costs. He is a failure,&rdquo; he said.More on this: Lenku squandered all his chances to lead &ndash; NkedianyeBut on March 13, Lenku pledged to end clan animosity if elected and accused the Governor of failing the youth.&ldquo;Nkedianye took office after he was elected in 2013 on the belief he had promised the youth he will stand by them and even empower them economically,&rdquo; he noted.More on this: Nkedianye funding rivals to ruin my bid - Lenku
