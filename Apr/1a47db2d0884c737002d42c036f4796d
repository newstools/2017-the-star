Businesses in Eldoret town were grounded for more than three hours as Governor Jackson Mandago and Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi intensified their last-minute campaigns. The two are seeking reelection on the Jubilee Party ticket in today’s primaries. There were long traffic snarl-ups on almost all roads as the aspirants held roadshows, and stopped to address residents at Paradise junction on Uganda road. “I  am here to plead with you to give  me a second term so that I complete the projects I initiated,” Mandago said on Wednesday. The governor said  about 1,000 police officers had been deployed in the region to provide security. He insisted any attempt to rig the nominations will be met with resistance from his team. Sudi assured his supporters  no one will be allowed to steal votes.
