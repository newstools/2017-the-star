Olympic 3000m steeplechase champion Conseslus Kipruto is hoping to start the 2017 IAAF Diamond League with a win at the Doha opener next month.The world steeplechase silver medallist said he will be using the series to prepare for his title defence at the IAAF World championships in London in August.&ldquo;The season is on and my focus is to prepare to get another title after the Olympic victory,&rdquo; he said.Kipruto is leading a strong field in the 3000m race hoping to continue his success from Rio Olympic where he clocked an Olympic record of 8:03.28 .His attempt on the world record returned a personal best time of 8:00.12 at the season-ending Brussels Diamond League, a month after the Olympics.Kipruto faces strong competition from the field&rsquo;s 5000m specialists including Paul Chelimo of USA, who got a silver medal in Rio.Hagos Gebrhiwat and world indoor champion Yomif Kejelcha, both of Ethiopia, 2012 London Olympics bronze medallist, Thomas Longosiwa are also in the starting list.&ldquo;I want to use the event for speed and by August everything will be okeyI am looking forward to the season&rsquo;s opener but you know I will be competing with the tough guys,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;However I will be doing my best to make sure that I impress in the track as the season kicks off.&rdquo;His star in the 3000m steeplechase has continued to shine since he made his international debut at the 2011 World Youth Championships in Lille, France.He went on to win the World Junior title in Spain in 2012, placed second at the 2013 World Championships in Moscow, Russia and at the 2015 World Championships in Beijing, China before capturing the Olympic title in Brazil eight months ago.&ldquo;I have seen my career progress and all I can do is to thank God for the favour since I have been staring with him,&rdquo; He said.Having represented the new generation in the water and barrier race and the rivalry against multiple champion Ezekiel Kemboi, a fierce battle is expected to prevail this season again.Kemboi wanted to quit it with a medal at the Rio Olympics but his disqualification for line infringement, where he lost his bronze medal, saw him make a turn around and will be in contention for the title in London.Italian athletic coach and manager Renato Canova has tipped Kipruto to break the world steeplechase record with his personal best just eight off the 7:53:63 mark set by Saif Saaeed Shaheen of Qatar (formerly Stephen Cherono) in 2004.
