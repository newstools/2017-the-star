Machakos governor hopeful Wavinya Ndeti (pictured) has told incumbent Alfred Mutua to clear his name with the EACC before seeking reelection. Speaking at Mung&rsquo;ala AIC on Sunday, Wavinya said Mutua has failed the integrity test and should not be allowed to run. &ldquo;We have in the last four years seen him in courts trying to fight corruption cases raised against his administration,&rdquo; she said.
