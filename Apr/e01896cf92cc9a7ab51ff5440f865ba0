ODM has an elaborate plan and strategy to outdo the Jubilee Party in Nairobi.Governor Evans Kidero &mdash; the city point man and head of campaigns &mdash; and branch chairman George Aladwa yesterday said the party has mapped out the capital and plans to scoop majority of the seats.They addressed hundreds of party aspirants in Nyayo National Stadium.&ldquo;We will win at least 13 out of the 17 constituencies and 60 out of the 85 wards. We will leave out Starehe, Kasarani, Roysambu and Embakasi Central because those are Jubilee strongholds,&rdquo; Aladwa said.In 2013, ODM won seven out of the 17 MP seats. It, however, reclaimed Mathare through a by-election, making it eight against nine.Kidero said they will ensure free and fair primaries to prevent a fallout.&ldquo;The only way we can be strong and beat Jubilee is to remain united. Let&rsquo;s support each other,&rdquo; he said.Kidero said they will soon launch campaigns to inform their supporters not to travel upcountry during the August election.He said 15 to 20 per cent of party supporters registered to vote in the city usually travel to their rural homes during election for fear of violence.The county boss said ODM will consider surrendering some positions to NASA affiliates, if that will make the alliance win.&ldquo;We shall negotiate, especially in Nairobi and Mombasa, because at the end of the day, Jubilee is our common enemy,&rdquo; Kidero said.The primaries are set for April 25. The Branch Elections Board assured the 650 aspirants that they will be free and fair.Chairman Paul Olendo said the board is prepared, as all election materials are available. &ldquo;We will use the same polling stations usually used by the IEBC. Results will be announced at the ward level and the winners given interim certificates immediately,&rdquo; he said.Secretary Agnes Owuor dismissed claims that some hopefuls already have nomination certificates.&ldquo;Nobody, including the chairman [Aladwa] here, has been given the certificate,&rdquo; she said.Owuor said all ballot papers are watermarked and are of different colours depending on the county, hence difficult to duplicate.She warned aspirants against causing chaos, adding that police have been informed.Those who cause chaos will be denied tickets even if they win, she said.
