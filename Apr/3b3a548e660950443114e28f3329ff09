Kiambu Senator Kimani Wamatangi (pictured) has dismissed NASA&rsquo;s plan to setting up a parallel tallying centre for the August 8 presidential polls.He said on Sunday the opposition should give the new IEBC commissioners a chance.&ldquo;It is wrong and misleading to form another tallying centre for the presidential results, yet they will have agents in all polling centres,&rdquo; Wamatangi said. He spoke at St Luke&rsquo;s ACK Church in Ting&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a. Wamatangi said the IEBC is the only mandated institution to administer, supervise and announce election results. He said the opposition is looking for an excuse for their supporters, since they know they will lose again. &ldquo;They know such an attempt will not see the light of the day. They are attempting it so that they will tell their supporters the election was rigged and that is why they lost.&rdquo;
