Nothing more, nothing less," one of the supporters said.Mwadeghu told journalists that he "won the elections straight and square" adding he will not participate in any repeat of the process."I am here with my supporters to pick my certificate because I beat Mruttu in the primaries," he said.Mwadeghu, a senior member of the ODM party, accused the party dispute resolution tribunal of sitting on his petition."If they have eaten (sic) someone's money, they should say instead of taking us in circles."Some supporters engaged ODM communications director Phillip Etale in a bitter exchange of words.They accused him of being part of a cartel "sabotaging Raila Odinga's interests"."You are telling us nothing...you have no interest of the party leader at heart," a woman in the group was heard telling Etale.At an earlier press conference, Etale revealed that police last night successfully thwarted a break in into a warehouse in Kisii.The party had stored ballot papers for the Homa Bay county primaries at the premises in question."An attempt was made to vandalise the election materials at a warehouse in Kisii but police averted the scheme," Etale said.He said the exercise started well in most of the polling centres save for some areas which experienced delays due to logistical challenges."No incident has been reported so far, we have put in place mechanisms to ensure success," he said.
