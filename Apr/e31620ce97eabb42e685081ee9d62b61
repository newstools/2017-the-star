Kisumu Governor Jack Ranguma has denied claims his administration received Sh42 billion for the past four years from the national government.He told a press conference on Monday that the funds have been prudently used on health, infrastructure, agriculture and education projects, as well as salaries.Ranguma is one of a number of ODM and other opposition governors who dispute the sums the Jubilee government disbursed to them.Speaking at the Sunset Hotel, he dismissed allegations his administration has failed to initiate projects due to massive corruption. His opponents have accused him of a poor development record, nepotism and poor delivery of services. According to the World Bank 2013-14 report, the county spent only one per cent of its funds on development.Kisumu Senator Anyang&rsquo; Nyong&rsquo;o, Hezron Mc&rsquo;Obewa, Asaka Nyangara and James Obondi are all eyeing the governor&rsquo;s seat. They say Ranguma does not deserve a second term and have urged residents to kick him out. &ldquo;We have expanded roads, built more than 45 health facilities and improved food security,&rdquo; Ranguma said.
