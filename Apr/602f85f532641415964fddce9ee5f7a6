South Africans are mourning the passing of Ontlametse Phalatse, an 18-year-old girl who was living with Progeria, a rare genetic disorder that causes rapid ageing. Last month she celebrated her birthday with President Jacob Zuma. The South African government has led the condolence messages using a picture of that meeting.She died yesterday at Dr George Mukhari Academic Hospital in Ga-Rankuwa&sbquo; outside Pretoria.Phalatse was one of two South African girls living with Progeria. She described herself as 'the first lady' after she became the first black child in South Africa to be diagnosed with Progeria and was regarded as an inspiring figure and a miracle child after outliving doctors&rsquo; predictions by four years.
