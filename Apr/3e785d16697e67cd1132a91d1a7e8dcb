My brain is preset so I can never sleep past then.My day is quite simple. I have a quick breakfast - something with protein then I have a dance session as my workout.I never have to hit the gym after sweating it out from a good dance session.I&rsquo;ve been enjoying learning lately, so if I don&rsquo;t have a course class, I go online to read and research on new music for my show.I love discovering new acts in the music, film, arts industries. Working for a station that plays urban African hits, I'm able to keep up-to-date with a lot of talent across the continent, which is exciting.I&rsquo;m full of energy by the afternoon and that is around the time my show starts.3PM &ndash; 7PM: I&rsquo;m on radio, giving Kenyans something to look forward to every evening.We discuss trending topics and everything that is of interest to the listeners.During the weekends, I hang out with my friends and family if I&rsquo;m not working as an MC.Sometimes I catch up on my favourite series or show, just like most Kenyans do.I dedicate Sundays to spending time with my family. After church, I&rsquo;m busy in my kitchen experimenting and perfecting my baking skills as well as trying out new recipes.Sometimes I turn my Sundays into sweating days and engage in extreme sports. I also try and discover new places in Nairobi.I&rsquo;m usually busy, but I always try to make time to attend events organised by my family and friends. It's important to me to support the people I care about.I also try to help the underpriviledged by attending various initiatives.
