Gatundu South will lag behind in development if the current MP is reelected, hopeful Kungu Kibathi said. He urged residents to reject MP Moses Kuria. Kibathi said Kuria has nothing to show for the two years he has been in office . He said Kenyans honoured Gatundu people by giving them the presidency, but the constituency might not get any benefits if Kuria is reelected. Kibathi spoke on Wednesday in Gatundu South.  JP nominations will be held today and Tuesday. He accused Kuria of giving Sh3,000 bursaries while applicants in other constituencies get much more. “We don’t need abusive leaders but leaders who have respect and work for the good of the people,” Kibathi said. Kuria  faced several hate speech cases, which collapsed for lack of evidence .
