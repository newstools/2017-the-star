Kilifi North MP Gideon Mung&rsquo;aro yesterday gave the county government 30 days to make public records of how three years&rsquo; of revenue was spent.Mung&rsquo;aro on Monday threatened to mobilise Kilifi residents to stop paying tax if the county government does not produces the records. Last month, he had given another a one-week ultimatum, but did not get any response. The legislator also accused the county of misusing funds. &ldquo;Kilifi people are suffering, despite all the billions allocated to the county,&rdquo; Mung&rsquo;aro said.He said he does not understand why Governor Amason Kingi has not made public the records.
