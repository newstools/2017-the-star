The hearing of a petition seeking to block Nyandarua Governor Daniel Waithaka from defending his seat will be heard next Thursday. A petitioner accused Waithaka of financial impropriety. He lodged a suit in Nyandarua before it was transferred to Nairobi for determination. Francis Kinyua said it would be a violation of the Constitution to allow Waithaka run without clearing his name first.
