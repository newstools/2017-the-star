TV producer, music video director and cinematographer Jibril Blessing has finally broken his silence after his partner Chantelle left him.A video of the Tokelezea hitmaker kissing another man (who is married) surfaced online, raising eyebrows, and Chantelle came out to set the record straight. In an interview with a local paper, Chantelle said they are no longer an item, were never married and went further ahead to confirm that she never cheated.J Blessings and Chantelle's marriage hit rock bottom a few months ago and they parted ways. We contacted J Blessing for a comment on this and he said: "I don't want to talk or answer anything about Chantelle. Bloggers write a lot of stories about me yet they know nothing about me at all. I will not answer! I'm busy with my career."The soft-spoken Link Video Global CEO says he is a happy man and doing great career-wise. "I have so many big things coming up. I'm working with upcoming talents and soon will be launching them. I'm also working with Churchill Show and I thank God for all the blessings. I'm good where I am right now," he said.J Blessing and Chantelle stayed together for quite a while and even had a son, who died at six months' old after falling sick.
