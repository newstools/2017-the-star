Machakos Deputy Governor Bernard Kiala has welcomed CCU party leader Wavinya Ndeti&rsquo;s move to join Wiper. Both Kiala and Ndeti want to run for governor.Speaking to the Star on the phone yesterday, a day after Wiper signed the Wavinya pact, Kiala said her decision to join Wiper was long overdue.&ldquo;This is actually what we have been advocating for because we all believe that the Wiper Party is the one that captures the aspirations and interests of the Lower Eastern People,&rdquo; he said.He, however, asked her to prepare for a tough battle in the party primaries.&ldquo;As she joins us, we are only asking her not to come along with conditions since our rule is that the party will hold free and fair nominations,&rdquo; Kiala said.&ldquo;I am not going to this nomination to lose, but in the worst event I happen to lose in a fair and transparent exercise, I will be the first person to congratulate her and support her.&rdquo;Kiala said being a long serving member of Wiper will be an added advantage to him in the primaries, as many may prefer to work with the devil they know than the angel they do not know.He, however, said that there is still room for consensus as it was the wish of party leader Kalonzo Musyoka.&ldquo;We have not come together to discuss anything about building a consensus but the proposal is there,&rdquo; Kiala said.Machakos Senator Johnston Muthama, who has been campaigning for Kiala since the deputy governor fell out with his boss Governor Alfred Mutua, told the Star yesterday that he would hold a press briefing on the same.&ldquo;What I have to say about this matter is more of just a comment. I have very many things to say to Kenyans and more so the Wiper fraternity and I will say that in a full press briefing in,&rdquo; he told the Star.Wavinya has already lined up outgoing East Africa Legislative Assembly Member Peter Mathuki as her preferred running mate with an agreement to share power on a 50-50 basis.Wavinya was unavailable for comment as she was said to be held up in meetings. Her phone calls were diverted.
