Kenya&rsquo;s pre-General Election political parties&rsquo; nominations process is too complicated, messy and unwieldy.In every party, it seems to aim at a mini-general election, which is beside the point. Most of the full year before August 8 has been frittered away with no meaningful timelines imposed, so that, in the end, and especially this year, everyone seems to be flying on a wing and a prayer.The most ambitious nominations bid yet, ruling party JP&rsquo;s one-day attempt on Friday last week, collapsed under the weight of its own contradictions.Going forward, the system should be overhauled and enough time allocated for the process.All parties should borrow a leaf from Tanzania&rsquo;s Chama Cha Mapinduzi and have delegates elect candidates so that hundreds rather than thousands of voters are involved in the primaries.CCM style nominations do not mimic the main event of Election Day. There is no call for that. The electorate still gets to vote on D-Day and democracy is well and truly served.
