Police will in the next three weeks get new accommodation because 1,000 housing units are almost complete.The houses have been under construction for more than a year.The first batch of 250 units has been handed over to the force, which for years has lived in ramshackle accommodation.Housing and Urban Development PS Aidah Munano says plans are underway to construct additional 1,000 units in the 2018-19 financial year.Munano said they expected the new houses to take a shorter time to complete because they are now using new technology.&ldquo;We have so far completed 250 units and the next 800 units will be ready in three weeks,&rdquo; she said.The PS said they are in talks with development partners to finance the second phase, and the discussions will bear fruit.&ldquo;We are working with the National Police Service in identifying areas in dire need of housing,&rdquo; she said.The PS said there is an acute shortage of housing but the government is solving the problem. Munano said 200,000 units are needed every year, but only 50,000 are built.&ldquo;The Jubilee government promised to construct 300,000 housing units between 2013 and 2017, and we are about to achieve that,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;The government is committed to addressing the issue of affordable housing, and this has been done by enacting the necessary legislation and policies,&rdquo; Munano said. Housing Secretary Patrick Bucha said players have been invited to join the talks with a view of addressing the shortage.
