The just-concluded Jubilee Party primaries in Kiambu county have seen six MPs replaced by newcomers.The six are Esther Gathogo (Ruiru), John Kiragu (Limuru), Kigo Njenga (Gatundu North), Mburu Kahangara (Lari), Njoroge Baiya (Githunguri) and woman representative Anna Nyokabi.Gathogo bagged 6,431 votes. She was floored by businessman Simon King&rsquo;ara, who garnered 14,988 votes. Nominated MP Isaac Mwaura got 4,858 votes after ditching ODM and joining Jubilee Party last year.Gathogo was the first woman to lead Ruiru constituency. She won the March 4, 2013, election with 60,784 votes, beating her closest rival, King&rsquo;ara, who got 16,569 votes.Despite working to develop the constituency, which had just been carved out of the larger Juja constituency, Ruiru residents kicked out Gathogo and voted for King&rsquo;ara, whom they termed &ldquo;humble&rdquo;.&ldquo;Yes, Gathogo has done her best to develop Ruiru, but we wanted change. We felt King&rsquo;ara is a humble man who uses his resources to help the poor and marginalised,&rdquo; resident Phyllis Maina said.Njenga lost to ex-radio presenter Wanjiku Kibe in the Gatundu North race, after he got 9,589 votes. Kibe won narrowly with 10,169 votes, while former MP Kung&rsquo;u Waibara got 9,344 votes. Kibe won residents&rsquo; hearts with her manifesto, which seems to address their concerns. Njenga&rsquo;s failure was attributed to underdevelopment and misappropriation of resources. &ldquo;We have been following closely how the constituency development cash was spent through the Auditor General&rsquo;s report. We found that a lot of money and projects were questioned,&rdquo; said Kamwangi resident Pius Njoroge.&ldquo;We knew a time would come to make our decision and we have made it.&rdquo; In Limuru, former MP Peter Mwathi made a comeback when he bagged 18,456 votes against incumbent Kiragu&rsquo;s 14,786 votes.
