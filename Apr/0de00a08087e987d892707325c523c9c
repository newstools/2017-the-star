Governor Patrick Khaemba says some Ford Kenya officials are sabotaging him to push him out of the party.He said on Thursday he is being undermined by brokers who have promised governor aspirants a direct ticket.&ldquo;The officials have been going round hawking non-existent direct tickets, claiming I left the party. They use all means to push me out but I am in Ford Kenya to stay,&rdquo; Khaemba told the Star on the phone.Last week party officials rejected his demand for a direct ticket. They said Khaemba should face his three rivals at the ballot. Party leader Kakamega Senator Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula was present.Khaemba is the only Ford Kenya governor. Some party insiders argue it would be unwise to expose him to nominations in which a weaker candidate could win, and be trounced by Jubilee on August 8.Branch secretary Martin Waliaula disagrees. &ldquo;There is no weaker candidate who will win. The man elected through nominations will be popular and will win.&rdquo;Khaemba has been feuding with party officials. Waliaula officials suspended Khaemba two months ago, but the decision was blocked by Wetang&rsquo;ula.Khaemba threatened to defect to ANC but Wetang&rsquo;ula ended the row.
