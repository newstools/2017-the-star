ODM leader Raila Odinga is likely to face a big headache ahead of the primaries, after some aspirants in Nyanza disagreed over members appointed to the counties&rsquo; election boards.Aspirants from Kisumu, Siaya and Homa Bay counties have urged the National Election Board to reshuffle or reconstitute the boards.The boards will preside over the nominations.Hopefuls said the process will not be free and fair, as some leaders have &ldquo;people&rdquo; in the board to look after their interests. In Kisumu, aspirants have demanded the county election board be disbanded and a new one reconstituted. They say the board is made up of partisan individuals.Two weeks ago, aspirants who are ODM bona fide members rejected the board headed by lawyer Geoffrey Yogo.They said it is made up of allies of Senator Anyang&rsquo; Nyong&rsquo;o, Nyando MP Fred Outa and Ayiecho Olweny, who are eyeing the governor, Senate and MP seats. &ldquo;We have noted and we reject the manipulation of the election process by Nyong&rsquo;o and Olweny as witnessed in a meeting called at [the] Royal City Nyamasaria a couple of days ago,&rdquo; a leaked statement dated April 1 seen by the Star reads.In Homa Bay, MP aspirants from two constituencies rejected the panel and urged Raila to intervene.Kabondo Kasipul MP aspirants Obonyo Mireri, David Onunda, Paddy Ahenda and Jared Alila said some officials are allies of incumbent Silvance Osele.In Mbita, MP aspirant Judy Kamaria and Humphrey Obatch asked the NEB to reconstitute the board, saying members are allied to MP Millie Odhiambo and are in her campaign team.In Siaya, the hopefuls said the board members are allied to various leaders in the county.Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo said the board is compromised and will not conduct credible elections.He said the board is allied to Governor Cornel Rasanga, nominated MP Oburu Oginga and Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi.Midiwo is among aspirants from the county who have expressed their reservations the board.Bondo MP Gideon Ochanda and Ugenya parliamentary hopeful Mary Olupe questioned the criteria used by the NEB in selecting the five members.Governor hopeful William Oduol and Alego Usonga aspirant Samuel Atandi said the NEB should transfer the board members.Yesterday ODM executive director Oduor Ong&rsquo;wen did not respond to text messages on the allegations.Last month, Ong&rsquo;wen urged members to expose liars who claim to have the power to influence the award of the party ticket during nominations.He said the party primaries will be competitive, free, fair and democratic.Ong&rsquo;wen said, &ldquo;Only the National Election Board is mandated to manage the nominations and it is bound to ensure the process is fair, transparent and free from manipulation.&rdquo;He said National Executive Council members, branch officials, governors and MPs will not choose nominees. &ldquo;Expose and shun masqueraders,&rdquo; Ong&rsquo;wen said.This was after Kisumu East MP Shakeel Shabbir accused officials from the national office of doing nothing to end leadership wrangles in his constituency.Shabbir said wrangles could lead to violence. &ldquo;The head office needs to show commitment to resolving the issue and tell us what to do,&rdquo; he said.Shabbir said members of one faction, which he did not name, has been threatening the other group, saying they will be denied nomination certificates if they are not loyal to them.Last month, Raila said the primaries will be free and fair. He held a six-hour closed-door meeting with aspirants from Nyanza.
