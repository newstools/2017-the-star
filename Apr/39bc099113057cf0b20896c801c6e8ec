Jubilee Party has warned that it will disqualify aspirants who engage in violence during the primaries that are expected to be competitive.Secretary general Raphael Tuju said this will ensure easier management of the nominations that will begin on April 22.Tuju said on Saturday that the party and the IEBC have also agree to deny such aspirants certificates to vie as independent candidates."We are committed to conducting a free and fair nomination. If you think you will pull a 'men in black' on us be warned that you are looking for a direct disqualification ticket," he said."IEBC has agreed that if it ascertains you were disqualified for engaging in violence you will not be issued a certificate to run as an independent candidate".National Elections Board chairman Andrew Musungu said the nominations will take place in 33 counties, at centres the IEBC marked as polling stations.Musungu said about eight million members will participate in the exercise using their smart cards."We have undertaken a thorough training for all the returning officers and we are ready for the nominations," he said.More on this: Jubilee primaries peaceful, chaos belong with ODM, says Tuju
