Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong &mdash; whose &lsquo;victory&rsquo; was cancelled &mdash; says the new ODM team elected after chaotic primaries last Thursday is working on how to deliver all seats to the party.The party cancelled Busia governorresults and ordered fresh polls on April 25.Ojamoong addressed a press conference in Busia on Saturday attended by seven MPs, a women representative and 35 ward administrators.He said the team is a formidable.&ldquo;People have been spreading a pack of blatant lies that Busia is burning after the ODM primaries. There are no protests in the cosmopolitan county. We are ready for the future ahead of us,&rdquo; Ojaamong said.He continued, &ldquo;People have also been spreading propaganda Teso South has only 40,000 registered voters. The truth is the region has more than 67,000 voters according the IEBC register, while Teso North has more than 50,000 voters.&rdquo;Ojaamong said the Teso region is being painted in a bad light. &ldquo;Funyula recorded 77 per cent turnout and yet nobody wants to tell us about it,&rdquo; he said.Ojaamong said he is ready for a rerun, but added, &ldquo;I see no reason why the party should call for a repeat of the nominations.&rdquo;Governor aspirant Paul Otuoma&rsquo;s team, led by Peter Odima, gave the ODM secretariat 48 hours to give their candidate the nomination certificate before they take their case to the people for direction.&ldquo;We are ready to make Ojaamong Otuoma&rsquo;s running mate &mdash; if he revokes the provisional certificate &mdash; or hire him at the Culture Ministry,&rdquo; he said.Odima added, &ldquo;We will not deputise him. He is a failure and the decision of the Busia people should be respected.&rdquo;The group said ODM will lose popularity in Busia county if Otuoma is denied the ODM ticket.On Thursday, two ODM leaders in Busia nursed injuries following chaos that rocked the party&rsquo;s primaries.
