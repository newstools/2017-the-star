Moses Wetang’ula’s Ford Kenya party has given Trans Nzoia Governor Patrick Khaemba a direct ticket, locking out three aspirants. “The decision is meant to guard the party against a fractious nomination in a process that had attracted three other candidates - Andrew Wanyonyi, John Mutenyo and Moses Khaoya,” party communications director Tim Machi said in a statement. Nominations for other seats are scheduled for Monday. “Following up with this decision, the management committee through the county office, will talk to the other candidates with a view of reaching an agreement and finding a way to work together to secure the seat,” Machi said. Bungoma nominations will be held next Wednesday. The direct ticket allows Khaemba to face off with one of the four Jubilee candidates eyeing the ticket during the party’s nominations next Tuesday.
