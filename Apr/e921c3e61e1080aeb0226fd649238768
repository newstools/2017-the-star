But sources say the violence is also politically motivated.In November last year, residents and conservancy owners, who spoke to the Star on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, said police had not acted to stop the flare-up, despite threats and complaints.One source said: "The rhetoric of drought is used by politicians to justify a takeover of territory ahead of the elections. It is a dry season, not a drought.&rdquo;He added politicians were &ldquo;using cattle belonging to big men" since livestock were a great way to hide ill-gotten gains.Following outcry by members of the public and several leaders, the government has now deployed KDF officers, GSU and Kenya Police Reservists for disarmament and to restore peace.More on this: Laikipia locals raise concerns over violenceAlso read: The poor are the real victims of Laikipia violence
