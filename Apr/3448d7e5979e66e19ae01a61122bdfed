Migori Governor Okoth Obado yesterday took a huge lead after results from seven out of eight constituencies were announced.Samuel Olala declared himself returning officer and announced the results after county election board chairman Tom Otike called off the exercise earlier in the day.Olala announced the results of seven constituencies, leaving out Awendo.Obado was named the winner with 110,122 votes against his closest rival former Cabinet minister Ochillo Ayacko at 59,449 after votes from Nyatike, Uriri, Suna East, Suna West, Rongo, Kuria East and Kuria West were announced.Anne Anyanga came third with 1,990. Paul Odola&rsquo;s result was not announced.The results were marred by rigging claims.Woman representative Dennitah Ghati was defeated by JKUAT lecturer Pamela Odhiambo, who got 72,690.Ghati got 49,179 votes followed by Nyatike politician Fatuma Mohammed with 30,785. Knut official Mary Owino&rsquo;s votes were not announced.Radio journalist Ben Okello won the senator ticket with 68,194 votes followed by former Migori speaker Gordon Ogolla with 48,692 votes. Nyatike politician Michael Ogola came third with 27,997 votes.The other eight aspirants&rsquo; results were not announced.Earlier Ayacko, Gordon Ogolla and Dickson Ogola disrupted activities at the Migori TTC tallying centre to serve an order by the county ODM tribunal to stop the exercise.The three complained about rigging. They said results from three constituencies &ndash; Suna West, Uriri and Awendo &ndash; had been compromised by the returning officers.Yesterday at dawn Uriri returning officer William Okuthe and his deputy were arrested with 2,500 ballot papers in Uriri in a private car without any police escort.Okuthe, who had just announced Walter Owino the parliamentary ticket winner, was arrested at Florence Hotel, Rongo town, with results which were to be taken to Migori TTC only 500 metres away.The Suna West officer went missing on Monday with the results after aspirants called off the process when some polling centres opened at 5pm.&ldquo;The results from the three constituencies where the returning officers were compromised have delayed. We appointed new ones to cover for them. We are just waiting for Suna West constituency results before we announce the winners,&rdquo; Olala said.Ayacko, Gordon and Dickson said the exercise was an anomaly as Obado was holding it hostage.&ldquo;We have been granted an order from the appeals tribunal from the county to stop the process. Even Olala, who has been announcing the results, is not the returning officer. We want all the process [called] off,&rdquo; Ayacko said.The three promised to seek redress from the courts and ODM National Elections Board.&ldquo;In Rongo, for example, a senator aspirant got over 40,000 votes, which is more than all the registered votes in the area, the rest of the results are shambolic and don&rsquo;t reflect the will of the people,&rdquo; Gordon said.In the MPs&rsquo; race, only Suna East MP Junet Mohammed was announced the winner after beating former Migori MP John Pesa by 8,671 votes cast to win with 14,912.Uriri MP John Kobado was defeated by aspirant Mark Nyamita, who was given the nomination certificate by Olala, though the results were not announced.Nominated MCA Rahab Robi got 8,503 votes against Tyson Kemege&rsquo;s 3,502 to win the Kuria East MP ticket.
