Clearing and forwarding agents have petitioned President Uhuru Kenyatta to intervene after the Kenya Revenue Authority &ldquo;arbitrarily&rdquo; refused to renew their practicing licenses.KRA has not renewed the licences of the over 1,350 clearing agents in the since January.Four months into 2017, the local clearing agents have been operating illegally, the Kenya International Freight and Warehousing Association national chairman William Ojonyo said.The clearing agents lobby group says KRA Commissioner General John Njiraini has not only introduced arbitrary requirements, but has gone ahead to selectively renew licences for some multi-national companies, leaving out small and medium firms forced to operate without licences.Kifwa said out of the 1,350 clearing firms, only four companies namely Bolore Logistics, Urgent Cargo, Tabaki Freight and Polygon Logistics had their licences renewed.Addressing journalists in Mombasa town on Wednesday, Ojonyo said the unlicensed local firms have been forced to scale down their operations &ldquo;for fear of breaking the law.&rdquo;&ldquo;Consequently, the movement of cargo at the port of Mombasa has slowed down and country&rsquo;s tax revenue from the clearing agents has reduced by 30 per cent per day,&rdquo; he said.The scaling down has affected over 500,000 livelihoods supported directly and indirectly by the industry Kifwa says in its petition, as clearing agents cannot operate without licenses.Ojonyo said they pay an annual licence fee of Sh40, 000 which the government stands to lose. &ldquo;We wish to call on the President to come and rescue the clearing agents who have been stead-fast in helping the government achieve its promise of vibrant socio-economic agenda for its people,&rdquo; he said.He said if the 1,350 clearing agents are forced out of business, it will be a clear message that the government is suffocating its own citizens by denying them opportunities for entrepreneurship.The clearing and forwarding agents have threatened to paralyze operations in the country if the Kenya Revenue Authority fails to address a licence stand-off.The agents have been on a stand-off with KRA since the beginning of this year. Last month, the agents went on a go slow after KRA maintained it will not renew their customs agents&rsquo; licences for 2017.The taxman has rolled out a raft of new regulations and fresh vetting procedures which the agents have dismissed as a move by cartels colluding with KRA to frustrate small companies, and push them out of business. They have accused customs officials of favouring multinationals in fraudulently obtaining exemptions and direct release from treasury, hence evading taxes.
