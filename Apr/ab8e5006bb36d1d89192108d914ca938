Conservationist Kuki Gallmann on Monday successfully underwent an operation to remove a bullet lodged in her stomach.The Italian-born author of the memoir &lsquo;I Dreamed of Africa&rsquo; was ambushed by gunmen at her ranch in Laikipia on Sunday.A source at the Aga Khan University Hospital said Gallmann is showing positive progress.Gallmann will, however, remain in hospital as doctors monitor her condition.The ambush is the latest in a series of attacks by herders seeking pasture for their animals in Laikipia after drought that has lasted for more than a year.During the attack, raiders blocked the road with a log, forcing Gallmann to stop.She was rescued when rangers from the Kenya Wildlife Service intervened.Gallmann was flown to the Aga Khan University Hospital in Nairobi.Gallmann&rsquo;s attack comes barely a month after Sosian ranch co-owner Tristan Voorspuy was shot dead by raiders while inspecting his lodges in Laikipia North.Lawyer Edward Muriu yesterday said the state risks being dragged to court over the ongoing lawlessness.He told the Star on the phone the state has been caught flat-footed, despite the fact Kenya &ldquo;has one of the most progressive constitutions in the world spelling out what is expected of the state&rdquo;.&ldquo;This is an open-shut case for a classic suit of negligence on the part of the state for compensation for the loss of lives and property,&rdquo; Muriu said.The Constitution gives the people power to hold the state to account for its actions and inactions.&ldquo;The state has been caught asleep on the job so Article 23( 3 )(e) of the Constitution should be invoked as a matter of urgency by herders, small-scale farmers and conservancy owners,&rdquo; Muriu said.Article 23( 3 ) provides that a court may grant an order for compensation where the rights of the aggrieved have been infringed.Raiders have destroyed property running into millions of shillings. The Gallmann family owns the 100,000-acre Laikipia Nature Conservancy.
