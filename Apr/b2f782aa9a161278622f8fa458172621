A party has asked the Registrar of Political Parties to ensure groups do not share initials as this could confuse supporters. People&rsquo;s Party of Kenya secretary general Josphat Njagi (pictured) yesterday raised concerns voters could confuse his outfit with the Progressive Party of Kenya. He said his party supports President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s reelection. &ldquo;If we support the government and the other party supports the opposition, it will be difficult to get a candidate to any House. This is so disturbing,&rdquo; Njagi said.
