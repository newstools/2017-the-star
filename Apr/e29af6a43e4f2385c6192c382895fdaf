The Federation of Kenya Employers CEO Jackline Mugo has said Kenya is losing jobs to East African countries and Africa in general due to its high wage bill. &ldquo;Companies are relocating to other countries and we are losing jobs to Ethiopia, Egypt, Uganda, Malawi and Rwanda because our minimum wage bill is too high,&rdquo; Mugo asserted.She pointed out that, Kenya minimum wage bill is approximate Sh 11,000 compared to Egypt (Sh 6,500), Ethiopia (Sh 5,000), and Tanzania (Sh 6,000).Mugo noted that, Uganda does not have a minimum wage and therefore Kenya should work in addressing the crisis of high salaries and wages.Speaking during the Rift Valley Region Annual General Meeting held in Nakuru, she acknowledged demands by trade unionists for minimum wage increment as the country approaches Labour Day celebrations.&ldquo;The approach of continual increase of wages with no regard to performance of the enterprises is not the right way to address the issue.&rdquo; She added. Mugo warned that, as a country there was need to avoid forcing companies to lay off workers or even close shop because of wages they cannot afford. &ldquo;Let us protect jobs first.&rdquo; Mugo added. Meanwhile, the lobby group has called on employers to allow their employees to participate in the August 8 general elections. &ldquo;It is stipulated in the constitution that every eligible registered voter should exercise that right therefore it is prudent for employers to facilitate for such.&rdquo;
