The state should provide adequate security during the Friday Jubilee Primaries to avoid chaos as witnessed during the ODM party primaries, Kiambu Senator Kimani Wamatangi has said.&ldquo;We witnessed ODM party elections being marred by violence, gun drama, tension and chaotic moments and in jubilee Party elections we would want security beefed up so that residents can feel safe coming out to participate in the nominations,&rdquo; he said yesterday during a meet-the-people tour to drum up support for his reelection.The senator said it is important for JP to conduct its primaries in a mature and acceptable manner.Kenyans should protect the tranquility of the country and political parties will have to do a much better job in organising and delivering the party primaries. And whichever way things go, the aspirants have to be willing to accept the results and embrace the process their parties go through,&rdquo; he said.Wamatangi also said JP should have a credible and competent internal structure for dispute resolution as per the Political Parties Act 2011 as it will be the first point of call in the resolution of any disputes arising from party primaries.
