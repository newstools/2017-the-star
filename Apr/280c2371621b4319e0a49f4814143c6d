Nominated Senator Martha Wangari yesterday urged Kenyans to elect more women in August.In a statement, she said electing more women will help avert potential crisis in the next Parliament and meet the two-thirds gender threshold set by the Constitution. The rule seeks to ensure that individuals of the same gender do not occupy more than two-thirds of a particular category of public positions.Wangari, who is eyeing the Gilgil MP seat, said to avoid unnecessary court cases and many nominated women, Kenyans should elect more women. &ldquo;The current National Assembly and Senate are clearly not properly constituted. It has, however, been allowed to operate by a Supreme Court advisory opinion, which I believe, will not apply after the August 8 election,&rdquo; she said.Wangari praised President Uhuru Kenyatta for challenging Parliament last week to pass the gender Bill.She, however, urged women not to &ldquo;wait for the positions at home&rdquo;, but to battle it out with men. &ldquo;An opportunity is here for us as women to step out and seek these positions. If we wait for them sitting pretty at home, no one will give them to us,&rdquo; Wangari said.She said it is unfortunate that few women have shown interest to run for governor. The senator urged parties to rule that if a man wins the governor ticket, they nominate a woman running mate. &ldquo;This is where political parties come in and ensure that women are being empowered and prepared for future elections,&rdquo; Wangari said.
