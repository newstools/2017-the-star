Former North Imenti MP Silas Muriuki (pictured) has is confident of winning the election as he now stands a better chance against incumbent Rahim Dawood than he did in 2013.Muriuki will run on the Mazingira Greens Party of Kenya ticket after recently ditching the Jubilee Party.He ran on the TNA ticket in 2013 and Dawood was elected on the Alliance Party of Kenya ticket.Dawood won with 26,871 votes against Muriuki&rsquo;s 24,185.Muriuki said Dawood has failed to account for CDF allocations he has received for the last four years as he has not initiated tangible projects.&ldquo;I built 22 new day secondary schools, 17 dispensaries, yet I was only being given Sh57 million. He is getting twice as much as I got, but he has not initiated projects like me despite the constituency being divided into two in 2013 to get Buuri and North Imenti constituencies, respectively,&rdquo; he said.Muriuki spoke to journalists on Tuesday after meeting delegates of Mazingira Greens Party of Kenya at Mulathankari Multi Purpose Development Institute. &ldquo;This time I will recapture the seat as residents have been crying because the development projects I had initiated have stalled. I will then start Agro businesses, give cheap loans to youths to start businesses, allocate bursaries and conserve the environment,&rdquo; he said. Muriuki urged residents not to look at parties but individuals because parties might be misleading.He said despite not being in Jubilee, he will support President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s reelection bid as he has initiated projects that have helped residents in Meru county.
