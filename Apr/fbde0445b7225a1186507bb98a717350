Four Ukambani MPs and a former legislator have accused NASA of encouraging violence by proposing to have a parallel tallying centre during the August polls.They are Machakos Town MP Victor Munyaka, Michael Kisoi (Mbooni), Joe Mutambu (Mwingi Central), Richard Makenga (Kaiti) and former Kibwezi MP Kalembe Ndile.They said it is illegal for political parties to have their own tallying centres.The leaders spoke at Kyangala Market on Monday during a rally to popularise the Jubilee Party in Ukambani.Kisoi said the only agency allowed to tallying votes is the IEBC.&ldquo;It's clear the merchants of political violence are at it again. They have failed to rally their supporters into registering as voters and now they have foreseen defeat,&rdquo; he said.Kisoi said if NASA sticks to its plan to have 20 agents manning a polling station in the 'Adopt a Polling Station&rsquo;, they will propose that Jubilee gets 200 for each polling station.Munyaka said it's clear that NASA will lose, since it has not yet agreed on a presidential candidate.&ldquo;With three months to the election, they still don't have a candidate. What miracle do they expect? They are already late,&rdquo; he said.The MPs asked Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka to crossover to Jubilee, saying he has no chances in NASA. Mutambu said the majority of Kamba&rsquo;s believe their interests will be taken care of in the Jubilee administration. Ndile said NASA is confused because the communities under it are now threatening not to vote if their preferred leader is not picked as the flagbrearer.&ldquo;When you go to Western, they are saying if it not Musalia Mudavadi, then they won&rsquo;t vote. When you go to Nyanza, they are saying if it is not Raila Odinga they too will not vote. The same case is happening here in Ukambani. How now do you expect such a coalition to win an election?&rdquo; he asked.
