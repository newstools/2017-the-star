Jubilee's Mombasa governor hopeful Suleiman Shahbal and running mate Ananiah Mwaboza have defended their "disappearance from public glare".The two said they don't want showbiz and encouraged a scenario where voters at the grassroots ask questions without the pomp of media coverage.This followed observations that they are only active when President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto are in Mombasa.Shahbal and Mwaboza said on Tuesday that they have been meeting different communities and stakeholders to sell the Jubilee Party agenda."Not inviting the media to our meetings does not mean we have not been meeting people," Shahbal said."Last evening, we concluded a series of meetings with the Somali community in Mombasa." Shahbal, who is a fierce critic of ODM Governor Hassan Joho, said this when he officially announced his resignation as the chair of the Gulf African Bank, which he founded, to concentrate on politics.He said they have also met persons with disability, student leaders, artistes, among other groups within Mombasa.The politician garnered 96,000 votes against Joho's 130,000 votes during the 2013 general election.In August, Shahbal said he will retain his votes and bring in more significant votes to beat Joho.Shahbal said they will conduct vigorous campaigns in every corner of the county after Jubilee Party nominations are scheduled."Mombasa residents want development. They do not want to attend rallies on empty stomachs," he said. He added that he would like to see Joho on the ballot so he can beat him hands down.Wiper's Hassan Omar (Mombasa Senator) and Hezron Awiti (Nyali MP) have also said the Governor should not be barred from the August 8 polls.Mwaboza told the Star that the door-to-door campaigns are meant to give the residents an opportunity to engage them."Rallies do not offer such opportunities. We want people to understand our agenda and ensure they vote for what they understand," he said."Anybody can say anything during a rally because they know they will not be subjected to defending their utterances by the public."[VIDEO] Ruto declares Shahbal Jubilee candidate to vie against Joho, Mwaboza running mate
