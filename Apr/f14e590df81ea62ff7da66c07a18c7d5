ODM has said a report on NASA flag bearer is valid and had been erroneously leaked out to the media.Last week, a report emerged from NASA's technical committee indicating they had settled on Raila Odinga as the presidential candidate and Kalonzo Musyoka as his running mate.NASA principals were expected to deliberate on the matter, but Musalia Mudavadi's ANC dismissed the report as inaccurate.But ODM said in a statement on Tuesday: "Clarification has to be made, that the report was valid and existent."Secretary general Agnes Zani said the NASA&rsquo;s National Coordinating Committee had been mandated to come up with the report which they did after 60 days of negotiations."That report leaked out in the form that the media presented. A few aspects figures were not those of the committee but the line-up presented had been agreed on in the committee," she said.More on this: It's Raila-Kalonzo! NASA experts sayZani said sentiments by ANC secretary general Geoffrey Otsotsi were skewed.ANC had dismissed the leaked report as fake, saying no consensus has been reached on who should face President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto in the August 8 polls."The assertion that there is no report is not accurate. That report, and other processes were to be furthered on by the principals, in next stages as was to be determined by our principals," Zani added.The committee included economist Dr David Ndii, Nairobi University professor Dr Adams Oloo, Kabarak University law professor Elisha Ongoya, former member of the now-defunct Constitution of Kenya Review Commission Abubakar Zein and ex-Mumias Sugar Company chairman Dan Ameyo.The principals are expected to publicly sign the historic agreement at a major political rally in Nairobi&rsquo;s Uhuru Park grounds on the weekend of April 15-16.The report also outlines the composition and structure of a NASA government should the opposition win the August 8 polls.
