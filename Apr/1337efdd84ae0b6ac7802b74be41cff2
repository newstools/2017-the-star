Two incidents of extrajudicial shootings by police in the city in recent days raise serious cause for alarm.One happened off-camera in the protected premises of State House more than a week ago.The other one, a double killing, was caught on candid camera in Eastleigh on Friday, resulting in a viral video on the Internet on Saturday.The shooting in State House grounds involved an unidentified intruder whose corpse was later deposited at the City Mortuary tagged UMA (Unidentified Male African).The shooting in Eastleigh apparently involved a number of policemen, some in mufti others in uniform, all armed, in broad daylight and surrounded by scores of bystander onlookers. In both cases the police appeared to have no use for intelligence gathering whatever.The intruder could easily have been overpowered and kept alive for interrogation to find out what he was up to and whether he had accomplices.In Eastleigh the two reputed gang members could similarly have been interrogated and taken through due process.
