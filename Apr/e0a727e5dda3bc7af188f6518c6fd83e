The Jubilee Party will not conduct nominations in Kwale for the woman representative after leaders gave the direct ticket to incumbent Zainab Chidzuga.She had been expected to vie for the ticket against former County Public Service Board vice chairperson Fatuma Tabwara. Tabwara has since joined the Party for Development and Reforms, a Jubilee affiliate party.Yesterday,Tabwara said she made the decision to join another party after the top Jubilee leader urged her to consider other options. Sources say the options included a lucrative job, claims Tabwara has denied.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not true that I was offered job or money to surrender the position to Chidzuga. The direct nomination ticket Chidzuga got is not a guarantee of winning the August 8 polls,&rdquo; she said.
