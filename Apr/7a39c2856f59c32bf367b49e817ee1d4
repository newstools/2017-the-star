My government is intact until the next governor is sworn in after the August 8 General Election, Baringo Governor Benjamin Cheboi said yesterday.Governor Cheboi lost the Jubilee Party ticket to Stanley Kiptis during last Monday&rsquo;s polls.Cheboi garnered 21,450, while Kiptis won with 65,426.The governor said he is still the governor and the county assembly will continue approving budgets.He spoke to the media at his Kabarnet town residence.&ldquo;Who said if one wins the party primaries he or she is guaranteed to win in the General Election? People should only celebrate after the winner is announced in August,&rdquo; Cheboi said.He said his administration is still serving residents.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m also certain the staff will remain unmoved if at all another government takes over in August,&rdquo; Cheboi said.Kiptis had earlier said he will cleanup the administration by removing heads of departments immediately after winning the Jubilee nominations.Cheboi complained of irregularities during the party primaries, saying some residents voted twice, when they were allowed to use IDs.&ldquo;This is unacceptable,&rdquo; he said.There were rumours that Cheboi was hospitalised after he was heckled and booed in his home turf.He dismissed the allegations, saying his health is good, strong and ready to work in any public position.&ldquo;As a senior citizen of this country, I only want to tell our people that is is not civilised to heckle leaders. If they dislike someone, the best way is to vote them out,&rdquo; Cheboi said.In March, Cheboi was among Baringo Jubilee leaders who were heckled when they rose to speak at a rally attended by Deputy President William Ruto.Others were woman representative Grace Kiptui, MPs Moses Lessonet (Eldama Ravine) and Hellen Sambili (Mogotio).The governor was shouted down by residents who were seemingly displeased with his performance.They hurled objects at the podium when Cheboi rose to speak, forcing the county boss to cut short his address at Eldama Ravine grounds.They shouted, &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t want Cheboi! We want Kiptis!&rsquo;. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay. Thank you,&rdquo; the governor said when the crowd became uncontrollable. The same was for the MPs.When conceding defeat last week, Cheboi said although he lost the ticket, he is still loyal to the party.&ldquo;I must take this time to register my sincere appreciation to all Jubilee candidates who managed to win the tickets in various seats. I urge each of them to remain firm and keep the fire burning in the party ahead of the August election,&rdquo; he said.Cheboi said parties should have structures that will give Kenyans credible leaders. He did not respond to questions on whether he will run as an independent candidate.&ldquo;After all, the people will have the final word to decide who is the best person to serve them,&rdquo; Cheboi added.
