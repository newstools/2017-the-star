Former powerful Finance minister David Mwiraria passed away yesterday at Karen Hospital in Nairobi after battling bone cancer.Mwiraria, 79, was a long-serving civil servant before joining politics in 2002, when he was elected to represent Imenti North constituency.Mwiraria (pictured) was forced to resign as minister on February 1, 2006 after being linked to the multibillion-shilling Anglo Leasing scandal.He said he was innocent and that his move to step down was to allow investigations.Then President Mwai Kibaki in July 2007 appointed him Environment minister after investigations, although no report was provided clearing Mwiraria from the scandal.In 2007, Mwiraria suffered a blow in his political career when he was defeated in the race for the Imenti North seat on the PNU ticket. Mwiraria has on several occasions failed to appear in court to answer to Anglo Leasing case queries. The hearing of the case was hampered because of his absence. Mwiraria&rsquo;s lawyer always postponed hearings, saying his client was ill. At one point, the High Court was forced to hear his Anglo Leasing case at the Karen Hospital. The former minister was charged with four counts of conspiracy to commit an economic crime to defraud the government of billions alongside 13 other suspects. He was also accused of engaging in a project without prior planning in addition to allowing irregular financing.
