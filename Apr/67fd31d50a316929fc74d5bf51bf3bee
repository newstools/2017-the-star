Recently, Imperial Hotel hosted clients to a cocktail to appreciate them for supporting it in the 32 years it has been in existence.It is through this support that Imperial Group managed to open a new budget hotel in the Kisumu CBD known as Imperial Express.Some clients only send guests but hardly ever get a chance to visit Kisumu, and therefore, it was important for them to meet and interact as a way of getting to know each other better.In attendance were Mayfair Holdings group general manager Pals Wagenaar and Roysambu MP aspirant Jecktone Obure, among other dignitaries and guests.
