Analysts at upstart investment company, Cytonn, have said the economy is still on a &ldquo;firm footing&rdquo; despite challenges. Ravaging drought, political risk ahead of the August 8 polls and rising oil prices which may weaken the shilling are some of the challenges which have dragged growth.Cytonn, however, says growth is being underpinned by continued public investment in infrastructure development, the growth in the financial sector and the recovery of the tourism sector. The expansionary budget for 2017-18 will further support growth of the national wealth, the firm says in its quarterly report. &ldquo;There was a 2.4 per cent increase in the budget to Sh2.3 trillion from the Sh2.2 trillion in financial year 2016-17 ... with the bulk of it being financed by tax collection,&rdquo; Cytonn says. They, however, see under-absorption of development expenditure, which has averaged 65 per cent in the last five years, persist in the 2017-18 fiscal year. Recurrent expenditure, on the other hand, has overshot the budget estimates with absorption of 103.5 per cent. The firm has projected a growth of between 5.4 and 5.7 per cent in the economy this year, down from an estimated 5.9 per cent growth in 2016.
