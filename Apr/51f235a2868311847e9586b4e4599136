Its trading was however temporarily suspended to prevent fraud following a system breakdown.Treasury has however embarked on a national campaign to increase the number of accounts on the platform with a target of three million new registrations.&ldquo;The release of the bond(Sh4.85 billion) can either be once or slowly depending on the appetite,&rdquo; Treasury public debt management director general Wohoro Ndohho said during the ringing of the bell for the bond at the exchange on April 11, &ldquo;we are looking at the trends.&rdquo;Treasury CS Henry Rotich has ordered the registration for M-Akiba bond to continue.&ldquo;I strongly urge you to register in large numbers between now and June 2017.
