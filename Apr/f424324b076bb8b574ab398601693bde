Months after Kenyan international footballer Michael Olunga made headlines for clinching a lucrative transfer deal from Swedish outfit Djurg&aring;rdens IF to the newly promoted Chinese outfit Guizhou Hengfeng Zhicheng FC, it seems like the chatter surrounding his transfer fee won't quiet down.One local daily reported that former Harambee Stars manager Jacob 'Ghost' Mulee, who is the footballer's footballing father-cum-agent, pocketed a whopping Sh38million from the deal, approximated to be worth over half a billion shillings, as compensation for training and educating the 23-year-old hotshot.The news spread like wildfire. Ghost was at pains to explain that he did not make that much money."I have neither received nor seen a cent of the said millions. Guys are quick to spread rumours without even taking the time to understand our expenses at Liberty Sports Academy, where Olunga's talent was nurtured," said the former Harambee Stars coach, who is the Liberty Academy's technical director. "People are busy claiming I have received the money and all I can do is laugh it off. People should understand how these things work. It's not as easy as it may seem," Ghost added. "Some have been flooding my phone with text messages asking 'Ghost can I order a few rounds at my local on your bill?'"
