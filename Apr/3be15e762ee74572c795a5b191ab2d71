Businessman Bundotich Kiprop, alias Buzeki, has rejected Jubilee primaries results for Uasin Gishu governor.Governor Jackson Mandago was declared winner with 126,681 votes, Buzeki garnered 82,869.Buzeki said he has been summoned to the party headquarters after he filed a formal complaint for what he termed &ldquo;massive malpractices&rdquo;.But Mandago said Buzeki should accept defeat and join him in uniting the people of Uasin Gishu. &ldquo;My demand is that the polls be repeated in a free and fair manner,&rdquo; Buzeki said.He said his agents did not sign Form 16 to ratify results in polling stations and that the majority of voters in Eldoret town were denied a chance to vote.&ldquo;If Mandago wants to be governor of a few people, then that&rsquo;s not fair because Uasin Gishu has all communities,&rdquo; Buzeki said.He appeared before the Jubilee elections board yesterday to present his complaints.Buzeki said only about 10,000 residents of Eldoret town were allowed to vote.He said the polling stations were opened six hours late and many voters were chased away.Sources said with the slim margin of about 40,000 votes Buzeki is under pressure from his supporters to run for the seat as an independent, but the businessman said he hopes Jubilee will hear his complaints.Jubilee regional coordinator Joseph Mathai said losers in the primaries are free to file complaints at party headquarters.
