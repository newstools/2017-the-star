Former Kitui South MP Samuel Kiminza, seeking to recapture the seat on the Jubilee ticket, claims there are plans to rig the polls.Yesterday, he said incumbent Rachel Nyamai was lobbying to get a direct Jubilee ticket and have the nominations cancelled. &ldquo;I have learnt that a senior Jubilee official had been convinced by Nyamai that she should be given a direct ticket because she allegedly enjoys 65 per cent popularity. But the voters want to be allowed to exercise their democratic right to nominate the candidate of their choice,&rdquo; Kiminza said on the phone. Nyamai was unavailable for comment. Jubilee secretariat Kitui branch official Josephat Mulyungi said he has already received the complaint.
