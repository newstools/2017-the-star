Funyula MP Paul Otuoma has said the battle for the Busia governor seat between him and Governor Sospeter Ojaamong was triggered by the failed 2013 negotiated democracy between Luhya and Teso communities.Before the 2013 elections, Luhya and Teso leaders agreed to give Ojaamong the governor slot and have a Luhya, Kizito Wang&rsquo;alwa, as running mate. The Luhyas took the senate and woman representative positions.&ldquo;It failed terribly and brought us a lot of mediocrity in leadership. That is why the people of Busia, including Tesos, asked me to run for the seat,&rdquo; Otuoma said on the phone. Otuoma said Ojaamong reneged on the deal when he chose to turn the governor position to a one-man show by sidelining his deputy.
