Bungoma senator aspirants are bracing for a bruising battle should Senator Moses Wetang’ula decide to defend his seat as a fallback plan. No hopeful in the county is running on the Ford Kenya ticket, an indication it has been reserved for Wetang’ula. Wetang’ula had launched his presidential bid and has been holding talks with his NASA-co principals on who among them should be the flagbearer. Cord leader Raila Odinga, Wiper’s Kalonzo Musyoka and ANC’s Musalia Mudavadi are in the race for president. Speaking to the Star yesterday in his Makutano home, Jubilee senator aspirant Juma Mukwhana said he is alive to the fact Wetang’ula may seek to retain his seat if he will not fly NASA’s flag. “All indications are showing that he could fall back and run for the seat, but we want to assure him that he  is going to get it rough,” he said. Mukhwana said it would be embarassing for Wetang’ula to launch the presidential bid, only for him to run for a “minor” seat. Boniface Nyongesa, a  journalist, received ODM direct ticket to run for the seat. Former journalist David Makali will battle it out with former Webuye mayor Crispus  Wamwoyo for the ANC ticket. Wamwoyo has been running well oiled campaigns with former councillors. “He is on record vowing that he is not mad to launch his bid for presidency. He should keep his word,” Nyongesa said. He said Wetang’ula should brace for a mother of all battles.
