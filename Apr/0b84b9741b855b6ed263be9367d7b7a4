Elders from the Boni, a minority community in Lamu, want the government to help them access the monthly stipend allocated to elderly persons.Yesterday, they said they have never received the money.The elders accused the government of marginalisation and deliberately leaving them out of the programme, while elders from other parts of Kenya benefit.Speaking in Pandanguo, Lamu East, they said many Boni elders are poor.&ldquo;Why must there be double standards where the Boni people are concerned? Why must we be left out of everything? Are we not deserving?&rdquo; Musa Guyo said.Lamu county commissioner Joseph Kanyiri told the elders that they will soon receive the cash. He asked them to register at the relevant government offices.
