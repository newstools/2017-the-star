Gin Ideal is a fast-rising Kenyan female artiste who hit the top music chats with the song Rede. After the original song made a piercing impression to her fans, Ideal was in for a remix of the song.The Rede hitmaker did a remix of the original with Kenya's dance hall artiste Wyre and before it was released, Gin Ideal had first settled for Uganda's Bebe Cool.Word Is sat with the female star, who explained that she sent the original to Bebe Cool and instead of putting his words to add to the remix, Bebe Cool went on to copy paste her song and came out with another song called Dede, with the same melody."In the beginning we had settled on Bebe Cool and then he went ahead and took my chorus and did a song called Dede," she said.Rather than take any legal action, Ideal who now has a new hit called Kuna Kitu, chose to let it go."I had a choice of being all dramatic. I just chose to let it all go. It was someone i respected. For me, he proved to be shady."
