Gender CS Sicily Kariuki yesterday condemned violence against women seeking elective positions.She urged leaders to settle their scores in other ways instead of resorting to physical violence, hiring goons and intimidating opponents.&ldquo;The way women are being exposed to hooliganism and being threatened by their male opponents is totally unacceptable. It is barbaric and uncalled for,&rdquo; she said in her Harambee House office.
