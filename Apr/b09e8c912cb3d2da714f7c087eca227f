The 2015 Kenya Open champion Sanford Otundo won the Nordin Totals and Ekeno Bullets Cups during the Mini Bisley shoot yesterday at the Defence Forces Rifle Range in Nanyuki, Laikipia County.The General Service Unit sharpshooter carded 244, 25vee-bulls out of the possible 255 points to claim the short range aggregate title.Otundo&rsquo;s exploits forced GSU teammate William Ahongo to settle for SuperX1 on 241, 23v to nose out Defence Forces Rifle Association&rsquo;s Moses Wachira to SuperX2 on count back. Wachira recorded 241, 18v.After the short range triumph, Otundo has now set his focus on the long range shoot which started yesterday and ends tomorrow where he will be seeking to defend the Mini Bisley title. Otundo won the Inspector General Cup in March but fell short in the Deputy IG Cup in the same month, where he trailed teammate Christopher Saina.&ldquo;This time I want to go all the way. Last time, I missed the DIG Cup but this week I want to be consistent. I&rsquo;ve won the short range aggregate and I am now aiming at the grand aggregate too and to defend the Mini Bisley,&rdquo; said Otundo, who is looking to win the second trophy in 2017 after successfully defending the IG Cup.&ldquo;I know the kind of conditions at the range and how deep within myself I can dig to improve on my scores. Target shooting is all about the firer striving to beat the wind and mirage. This is what ranks shooters. There is no chance to engage opponents like in other sports,&rdquo; he said.But Otundo, who is targeting to reclaim the Kenya Open, said defending the Mini Bisley Trophy would mean a lot to his career.He won the 2016 Mini Bisley after bagging 502 points 34v, edging his rivals DFRA&rsquo;s Paul Munene (486, 24v) and Railways Police unit John Ihugo (484, 30v) to SuperX1 and SuperX2 respectively.&ldquo;It feels really good to be the winner of a major championship but losing the Kenya Open feels like I left something out there,&rdquo; added Otundo.
