Machakos Deputy Governor Bernard Kiala is eyeing the governor&rsquo;s position.He has said the Wiper candidate for the position will be determined through nomination.Kiala spoke in Mutituni Market on Sunday. He will face Wavinya Ndeti and outgoing EALA MP Peter Mathuki in nominations on Friday.He denied claims Wavinya is the official Wiper candidate in the governor race.Speaking at St Jude&rsquo;s Catholic Church in Athi River on Friday, Wavinya said it had already been agreed that she is the Wiper candidate for governor.She said her running mate would be Mathuki.&ldquo;I am the Wiper candidate for Machakos governor. This is not our wish but the people&rsquo;s will,&rdquo; Wavinya said.However, on Sunday Kiala said no one has been issued with the party certificate and, therefore, the official position is that there will be a primary. He said assertions the party will not hold nominations are a big lie.Nothing of the sort has been communicated by the party leader, Kiala said.&ldquo;The official spokesperson of the party is the leader himself and I have not heard him say such a thing. &ldquo;Anybody else going out there to say his/her own things is deceiving the people,&rdquo; Kiala said.In the party&rsquo;s official list of candidates for the nominations, and which the Star has looked at, Wavinya, Kiala and Mathuki are listed as candidates for governor.Kiala said the only negative things he might say concerning Wavinya and her proposed running mate concern the best interests of the electorate.&ldquo;I have heard them asking me to agree to hold talks. But the only talks I will agree to are those that ensure every candidate shows their manifesto and not talks based on who gets what percentage of government,&rdquo; he said. Wavinya returned to the party she quit in 2013 after losing to Governor Alfred Mutua, who was elected on a Wiper ticket.He quit to form Maendeleo Chap Chap. &ldquo;This is a journey we started a long time ago to bring Ukambani together. &ldquo;We &mdash; CCU, Muungano and other parties &mdash; have left our houses to join Wiper because we come from the same region,&rdquo; she said.
