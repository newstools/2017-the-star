Since the removal of hawkers in Eastleigh, the streets have transformed for the better. Eastleigh, which is one of the biggest trading centres in Kenya with over 50 shopping malls, is now less congested, safer and cleaner."Many shoppers lost their luggage to thugs due to congestion," said John Waweru, a matatu driver plying the Eastleigh route.He said the thugs, who posed as luggage carriers mostly for wholesalers, would prey on a client and the moment the luggage is handed over to them, they would disappear in the crowded streets. "Many people came to the stage asking if we have seen the person who carried their luggage," Waweru said.Pickpocketing was also on the rise as shoppers squeezed themselves in the streets.Known as Little Mogadishu due to its large ethnic Somali population, Eastleigh had earlier been transformed to a dumping site, with hawkers occupying every available space and blocking entrances to the malls.Hawkers had even taken over the newly built roads, and they would comfortably spread their wares without any apologies and even harass pedestrians for stepping on their space."We are happy the hawkers were taken away from the streets, and we hope they never get back," said Ali Ahmed, a shop owner in one of the malls.The hawkers were accused of dirtying the streets, making the trading hub a major eyesore.The hawkers, who didn't pay levies, had been accused of killing revenue for shop owners who paid for licences, rent and electricity, since they sold exactly what shop owners in the malls were selling.Anybody who visited Eastleigh then can now record a noticeable change, as the streets are cleaner. "Though we are not there yet, the streets are much better now than when hawkers were present," resident Henry Wambua said.Getting the hawkers out of Eastleigh was not an easy task. By the end of last year, Eastleigh had become a battlefield between the hawkers and the police. The hawkers would eventually be evicted and the estimated 20,000 stalls they used flattened. The eviction order was issued by the Nairobi county, which in turn saw the hawkers go to court to block the same.Senior resident magistrate Isaac Orenge of the Commercial Court later granted Nairobi county the orders. Shops in the area had been closed for more than two weeks as the fights escalated between hawkers and askaris, making mall owners lose millions of shillings. The hawkers were evicted at the beginning of last month.
