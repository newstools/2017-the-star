Tatu City has put an additional 100 quarter-acre plots on sale folowing increased uptake at its residential project Kijani Ridge, the real estate developer announced yesterday. &ldquo;We have seen a tremendous increase in uptake at Kijani Ridge as a result of a better realisation and appreciation of the Tatu City concept and value,&rdquo; Kenya country head for Rendeavour, Tatu City&rsquo;s majority owner and developer, Nick Langford said. The mixed-use development began construction of the first phase of Kijani Ridge in July 2015 following several delays resulting from legal and ownership disputes. Kijani Ridge will offer amenities including a club house and restaurant, a school, a mini shopping centre, a jogging track, a dam and natural green open space. The development project which sits on 2,500 acres comprises residential, commercial, industrial, tourism, social and recreation amenities for more than 100,000 residents and hundreds of businesses. The developer has welcomed the government&rsquo;s move to offer incentives to industries operating in Special Economic Zones, saying that the initiative will help to spur growth, and drive Foreign Direct Investment in Kenya&rsquo;s built infrastructure. &ldquo;With Special Economic Zone status, there are massive tax advantages for setting up businesses in Kenya making it possible for firms that had hitherto not considered the country as a business destination, to do so,&rdquo; said Langford. He said that the decision will encourage more firms to set up in the region and help in the successful operation of Industrial Parks that have been established in mixed-use development projects such as Tatu City. Tatu City is currently setting up a 457 acre industrial park with industries such as Unilever, Chandaria Industries, Dormans and Kim-Fay having signed up to expand or relocate their businesses.
