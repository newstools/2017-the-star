Mandera Governor Ali Roba has welcomed the extension of curfew by Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery.Commenting about the curfew for the first time, Roba said it has minimised terror attacks in the county that have left many people dead and scores injured. Bishaaro guest house was attacked on October 25 last year. Nkaissery last month extended the dusk-to-dawn curfew by three months; from March 28 to June 28 starting 7pm to 5am. The order was published in the Kenya gazette notice.But most of the residents have asked the government to review the decision, saying the move will interfere with Muslim prayers which are mostly held between 7pm and 5am.Muslims have cited Ramadhan calendar which will be released soon.Some Mandera leaders had last week asked the government to lift the new curfew. They said it is unconstitutional because it interferes with the freedom of worship.Mandera Township MCA Feissal Abdinoor with his colleagues at a press conference said the order has grounded businesses. They asked the government to find other ways of boosting security. &ldquo;The al Shabaab have continued executing attacks even with the imposed curfew. Equity Bank, police post at Arabia and Safaricom masts have all been raided at night. The government should offer tight security to prevent more attacks,&rdquo; Abdinoor said.Last week, a lobby challenged the extension in court. Northern Advocacy Organisation said the March 28 notice extending the curfew is unreasonable. They said no arrests have been made since it came into force last year.
