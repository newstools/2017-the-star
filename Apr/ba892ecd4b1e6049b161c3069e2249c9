Ford Kenya may have reserved the Bungoma Senate ticket for its leader and NASA principal Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula, an analyst has said.Isaac Wanjekeche says it is unusual that no Ford-K politician has declared he or she would challenge Wetang&rsquo;ula for the ticket.Wanjekeche yesterday said the party has prepared a fallback strategy for the Bungoma senator in case he does not get the NASA ticket.But Wetang&rsquo;ula is on record saying he will not run for reelection if he is not picked as NASA presidential flagbearer. He launched his presidential bid in April last year in Masinde Muliro grounds, Kakamega. The event turned chaotic.Speaking to the Star in Webuye town, Wanjekeche said it was expected that many Ford-K politicians would run for the seat after Wetang&rsquo;ula announced that his bid for State House was unstoppable.&ldquo;His brigade within the party have blocked all candidates from contesting for that seat and that shows it is clear the certificate is reserved for the party leader,&rdquo; he said.Wanjekeche said this raises questions about the party, which says it is popular in Western.&ldquo;In Trans Nzoia we have four senatorial hopefuls who are vying for the seat on the Ford-K [ticket] and around two in Kakamega. But in Bungoma it&rsquo;s a big secret,&rdquo; he said. But Bungoma Ford-K organising secretary general Peter Wakhulekha said no one has expressed interest in the ticket. &ldquo;We welcome anyone who is interested in vying for the seat since we only have one candidate for the [governor] seat &ndash; Wycliffe Wangamati,&rdquo; he said. Two aspirants want to defeat Wetang&rsquo;ula on August 8. They are Juma Mukhwana of Jubilee and journalist David Makali of ANC.
