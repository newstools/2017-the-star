Operations at the newly launched Mtongwe ferry channel have been disrupted after a pontoon was swept away by strong waves in the Indian ocean.This jolted ferry users who were adjusting to the new channel after it was reopened in February by President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto.The channel had been closed after two ferries operating at the channel were decommissioned in 2012 after it was declared &ldquo;decapitated&rdquo;.The pontoon is said to have been carried away by water after two pillars, which balances it, were swept away by heavy tides.It collapsed at midnight. Nobody was injured as the ferry operates between 5am to 10pmKenya Ferry Services MD Bakari Gowa yesterday said the pillars were shattered by the heavy tides.&ldquo;At the moment, operations at the mainland will proceed, but the Bandari side will remain closed for a few days,&rdquo; he said.Gowa said the pontoon could not hold by itself without the support of the pillars, hence it submerged.He, however, added that operations at the channel were ongoing after the landing side was rerouted to the Likoni channel.&ldquo;We know it will inconvenience residents, but we&rsquo;ll be ferrying people from the Mtongwe channel across to the Likoni channel,&rdquo; Gowa said.The three-kilometre journey between the two points will take at least 30 minutes.Gowa said the company has deployed a team of engineers to restore operations.He said the Transport ministry has also sent its top engineers to assess the damage before reporting back to the Cabinet secretary, adding that the engineers will also assist in rebuilding the pontoon.Gowa said they are looking at a permanent solution that includes constructing landing ramps. He, however, said KFS does not have adequate land for the construction and will acquire extra land from willing to sellers.&ldquo;We have Sh120 million for building ramps. If we get enough land, it will only take four months to have them operational,&rdquo; Gowa said.In March, KFS chairman Seif Kajembe said there were plans to expand both channels to accommodate many users. He said the Mtongwe channel would be expanded to accommodate vehicles, but at the moment, it would only serve commuters.The KFS attributed the snarl-up at the Likoni channel to an increase in population in Mombasa.Last year, transport at the Likoni ferry channel turned into a nightmare for two weeks in September after two ferries were grounded.
