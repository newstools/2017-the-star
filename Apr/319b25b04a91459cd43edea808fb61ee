Hundreds of Kargi ward residents in South Horr, Marsabit, have protested against JP&rsquo;s cancellation of the nominations.The residents said the party&rsquo;s decision to cancel its elections in the ward three times is against their constitutional rights. The residents sit on the border of Samburu and Marsabit counties. They questioned why the nominations are held in Samburu, just across the river from them, and all other wards in Marsabit county.They said their leaders have neglected them for the last four years and are not ready to face them to ask for their votes.Resident Gabriel Marlenia said many voters have been turning up for the nominations as early as 5am, only to be told they have been cancelled and no reasons given.&ldquo;We want to know why elections were not held yesterday. We don&rsquo;t need such injustice. We don&rsquo;t accept issues that are going against our rights,&rdquo; he said.
