Kenya Sevens star Willy Ambaka&rsquo;s move to Manuwatu Turbos in New Zealand is in doubt following visa complications.According to Fairfax Media in New Zealand, the moved seems to have broken down due to issues in the visa acquisition process.Manawatu Rugby Union chief executive John Knowles confirmed they had been working with the agent of the 26-year-old winger to secure his services.&ldquo;There is the possibility of him coming, but this is subject to him acquiring a visa,&rdquo; he said. Ambaka, has already had one visa application denied, has been unavailable for Kenya in the recent Hong Kong and Singapore World Sevens Series.Speaking yesterday Ambaka said he has scheduled a second visa application appointment. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m waiting for the second visa appointment. Let&rsquo;s see how it goes and I hope I will get it,&rdquo; said Ambaka.Ambaka is not the only Manawatu prospect affected by the new visa process.Fielding flanker Kepu Tuifua, who was on the cusp of the Turbos last season and 2016 Manawatu academy winger Saia Teumohenga are both in the same situation in Tonga.If Ambaka&rsquo;s move eventuates, he will add to an improving group of outside backs in the Turbos&rsquo; mix this year.They already have Nathan Tudreu, Newton Tudreu and Ambrose Curtis, while former Turbo Lewis Marshall, who is back in the district, Wanganui duo Te Rangatira Waitokia and Kameli Kuruyabaki, 2016 Turbo Luther Hirini and 2015 Turbo Hamiora Thomas are all also battling for spots in the team.At 1.89m and 102kg, size is not an issue for Ambaka.While he may not be a household name, Ambaka will not need any introduction to regular watchers of Sevens rugby.He has been on the world circuit since 2011 and is third on Kenya&rsquo;s all-time try scorers list with 84 at an average of a try every two matches.He leads Kenya&rsquo;s scoring with 18 tries on the 2016/17 World Series.In 2013, he was a finalist for World Rugby&rsquo;s Sevens Player of the Year Award, won by New Zealander Tim Mikkelson, and he went to the 2016 Rio Olympics with the Kenyan Sevens team.But while his Sevens resume is extensive, his 15s career has yet to fully take off. He spent a season playing division two rugby in France in 2013-14 scoring six tries in 10 games for Lyon. He also played for Western Province in South Africa&rsquo;s Currie Cup before returning to the Sevens circuit.
