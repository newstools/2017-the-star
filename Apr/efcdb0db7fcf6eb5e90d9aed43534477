Former Gatundu South MP Moses Mwihia was attacked on Tuesday by 30 youths while on his way to present two petitions against incumbent Moses Kuria over his conduct and alleged misuse of CDF funds.The youths accosted Mwihia as he alighted his car outside deputy county commissioner Stephen Kihara&rsquo;s office. He was injured in the right knee. The youths tore Mwihia&rsquo;s shirt and he lost a shoe in the fracas.&ldquo;One of them asked me why I was disturbing Kuria and if I would have been comfortable if the same happened to me when I was MP, but I didn&rsquo;t answer him,&rdquo; Mwihia said after recording a statement at Gatundu police stationHe was saved by policemen who arrested one of the youths, but the others fled.Nation journalist Mary Wambui was forced to delete images of the attack.&ldquo;About 30 young men came to where I was seated and ordered me to delete the images. I obliged when I sensed they were up to no good. One even warned me in Swahili saying chunga usikufe bure (don&rsquo;t die for nothing) before uttering other unprintable obscenities,&rdquo; she said. Gatundu police boss Bernard Muli said investigations are underway.The two petitions, which were earlier presented to the EACC on March 10, called for investigations.The petition on Kuria&rsquo;s conduct alleges he was directly involved in tendering, which is &ldquo;irregular, suspect and bordering on fraud which amounts to violation of the Constitution&rdquo;.The petition signed by Mwihia, Moses Kibati, Isaac Karanja and Elijah Kimani says documents show almost all tenders were won by Kuria&rsquo;s close family members. A list attached to the petition shows directors of 14 prequalified companies that won tenders with the Gatundu South CDF are close relatives of Kuria and were registered after he took office. The petiton states the MP used his position to influence award of tenders.
