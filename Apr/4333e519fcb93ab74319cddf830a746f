There is no secret list of preferred ODM nominees in any part of the country, not even in its Coast stronghold, the National Election Board has said. Nominations will be held in Saturday in all five Coast counties. Mombasa Governor and ODM deputy party leader Hassan Joho and his close ally Mohamed Hatimy, the Mombasa branch chairman, have been accused of drawing up a secret list of their preferred candidates. Some party aspirants, especially from Kwale county, have claimed the two are working to skew the nominations in favour of their preferred candidates. However, NEB commissioner Edward Nyale on Friday said this is not the case. He said there will always be that perception because ODM is a popular party with strong and highly competitive aspirants. “It is bound to happen every time that someone might say one thing or another,” he said. Nyale addressed the press at Joho’s private offices, which he said have now become the ODM county offices. “Those participating in our elections are ODM members. We are one family. There is no favouritism. All the processes apply across the board to everyone,” he said. “I do not know what accusation you are talking about or interference in what sense. But remember, as the NEB, we do prepare a process for the whole of Kenya and this applies across the board.” Nyale said they have learnt from their mistakes and have done everything to ensure the nominations in the remaining coastal counties are free and fair. The five coast counties are Mombasa, Kwale, Kilifi, Tana River and Lamu. Nyale said the NEB is satisfied with the manner in which the party has conducted its nominations in the past 10 days.
