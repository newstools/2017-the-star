A U.S. judge temporarily halted the second of Arkansas' two planned executions late on Monday after the inmate's lawyers argued that the first execution was inhumane due to a flawed procedure.U.S. District Judge Kristine Baker in Little Rock, Arkansas, issued a one-line order staying the execution of Marcel Williams until 8:30 p.m. CDT (0130 GMT) or until she releases another order, whichever is later.The stay came just minutes before Williams, 46, was scheduled to begin undergoing the lethal injection process and approximately an hour after Jack Jones, 52, was pronounced dead by state officials.Arkansas is attempting to become the first state to put two people to death on the same day since Texas in 2000.Jones was convicted of raping and killing Mary Phillips, 34, in 1995 and trying to murder her 11-year-old daughter. He also was convicted of rape and murder in Florida.Williams was convicted of the 1997 kidnapping, rape and murder of 22-year-old Stacy Errickson. He also abducted and raped two other women.Williams' lawyers filed a last-minute appeal with Baker claiming that Jones was still moving more than five minutes after he received a sedative, midazolam, that is supposed to render inmates unconscious."Because Mr. Jones' execution appeared to be tortuous and inhumane, Mr. Williams moves for an immediate stay of his execution pending further review of the Jones execution in this court," defense attorney John Williams wrote.That description did not appear to match initial observations from reporters witnessing the execution, who said Jones' lips were seen moving after he finished his last words but did not describe any undue signs of distress, according to local media reports.Jones apologized to the young girl he left for dead, now a grown woman."I hope over time you could learn who I really am and I am not a monster," he said, according to reporter witnesses.Governor Asa Hutchinson said he hoped carrying out the sentence after 20 years would bring closure to Mary Phillips's loved ones.The 11th-hour stay for Williams came after the U.S. Supreme Court and the Arkansas Supreme Court on Monday denied a flurry of appeals by both men.
