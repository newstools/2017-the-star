The gloves are off. NASA affiliates yesterday traded barbs over the future flagbearer in what could dash hopes for a joint opposition presidential candidate.With 117 days to August 8 polls, the nasty war of words signifies deep suspicion and widening cracks, despite a facade of camaraderie among the four NASA chiefs.However, yesterday NASA principal Raila Odinga downplayed fresh infighting and blamed the National Intelligence Service for Monday&rsquo;s Kakamega protests by some ANC supporters. &ldquo;That was the work of NIS. We will not be divided because NASA is 10 million people, much bigger than a few people walking here and there, expressing their democratic right,&rdquo; the ODM chief told reporters at Orange House. On the flagbearer issue, Raila said the fact that details have not been formally announced means there has been no agreement. &ldquo;There will be a flagbearer, a running mate and other people who will do other things,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The world will not die because he has not been announced. What is this all the time you are discussing in the media? It is our business, not yours," he retorted when asked if supporters were anxious in naming the ticketBickering could hurt turnout in opposition bastions, even if the four principals stick together, analysts warn.Days before a make-or-break retreat by NASA captains next Monday to Wednesday, allies of ODM leader Raila and his ANC counterpart Musalia Mudavadi exchanged harsh words over the alliance's flagbearer.ANC in a statement accused ODM of &ldquo;bad manners, acting in bad faith&rdquo; and employing what it termed as &ldquo;dirty propaganda leaks&rdquo;.Ford Kenya's Moses Wetang'ula also weighed in, calling for honesty among affiliates.Comment: NASA either has a strategy or none at allIt's Raila-Kalonzo! NASA experts sayODM secretary general Agnes Zani, a trusted Raila lieutenant, fired the first salvo, saying the general agreement of negotiations on the opposition's ticket had been accurately reported by the Star &mdash; Raila for President with Kalonzo as his running mate.&ldquo;That report leaked out in the form the media presented. A few aspects and figures were not those of the committee but the line-up presented had been agreed on in committee,&rdquo; Zani said in a statement to newsrooms. She sits on NASA's12-member National Coordinating Committee.Zani castigated her ANC counterpart Godfrey Osotsi for disowning the NCC report.The ODM wing appeared to be enraged by protests in Kakamega reportedly planned by Mudavadi's key allies following the leak that he had been designated only chief minister in the NASA line-up."Chief Minister Ni Wewe (We don't need a post of chief minister)," read a prominent banner at the demo.Last week, the Star exclusively reported the NCC had concluded its work, designating Musalia as chief minister and Ford Kenya Party boss Moses Wetang'ula as National Assembly Speaker &mdash; if NASA wins.But within minutes of Zani's statement, Osotsi fired back.&ldquo;We are outraged &mdash; and Zani ought to know &mdash; admission by ODM that it is responsible for dirty propaganda leaks undermines the credibility and integrity of the NASA process. This level of arrogance shouldn&rsquo;t be entertained,&rdquo; Osotsi said.&ldquo;The ODM statement is a confession leaving no doubt as to where leaks of working documents meant to undermine NASA unity have been coming from. It is confirmation ODM is negotiating in bad faith. This is bad manners that shouldn&rsquo;t be entertained in any negotiation.&rdquo;The Zani statement was sent to newsrooms by ODM Communications Director Philip Etale, confirming it was sanctioned by the party's top leadership.On the other hand, the ANC communique was circulated to the media by Mudavadi spokesman Kibisu Kabatesi.Wetangu'la, who lately has been quiet on the raging debate on standard bearer, called for a ceasefire.The Senate Minority Leader termed a &ldquo;work in progress&rdquo; the decision on who will fly the NASA flag and castigated ODM for characterising media reports as &ldquo;true&rdquo; and perhaps &ldquo;final&rdquo;.&ldquo;We reiterate the decision on who flies the flag is still a work in progress and one over which the four principals will be holding a critical retreat very soon,&rdquo; Ford Kenya said through its director of communications Tim Machi.Until that is done, Ford Kenya said, what is on the table are just scenarios and suggestions of different names on the ticket.Ford Kenya castigated the hard line taken by a section of ANC supporters who have warned that either it is Mudavadi for President or NASA is dead&ldquo;We particularly take issue with supporters of Hon Musalia Mudavadi who over the weekend issued demands that it is either him flying the NASA flag or none,&rdquo; Machi warned.As principals, Ford Kenya said, none is NASA to pursue personal ambition.&ldquo;As a team under NASA, we are all bound by the responsibility and civic duty to free the country from the stranglehold of Jubilee,&rdquo; Machi said.Missing in action from yesterday's high-octane politics was Wiper, which previously had issued a seven-day ultimatum: either name Kalonzo the candidate or the party would go it alone.Wiper has remained silent following revelations Kalonzo had been slotted for NASA's second-in-command.At its retreat next week, NASA is supposed to agree and unveil the line-up.In her statement, Zani accused Osotsi of insincerity by insisting that there is no report on the NASA line-up.&ldquo;Clarification has to be made, that the report was valid and existent. NCC had been mandated to come up with that report and we did...The sentiments by ANC SG Mr Godfrey Osotsi are skewed. The assertion that there is no report is not accurate,&rdquo;Zani said.According to the nominated senator, the report was adopted at an NCC meeting attended by all four affiliates. &ldquo;Various methods were applied to attain objectivity through joint effort. Through triangulation, members did the task they had been assigned. The report had input by committee members at a meeting that had a quorum," Zani said.In his rejoinder, Osotsi insisted ANC is not aware of a formal report authored by the NCC for the attention of and shared with the NASA principals.
