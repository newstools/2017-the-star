Kitui Governor Julius Malombe has denied riding on the popularity of his friend-turned-foe Senator David Musila to clinch the governor seat in 2013.&ldquo;Musila is propagating lies and propaganda that he introduced me to Kitui people as a gubernatorial aspirant and vigorously campaigned for me ahead of 2013 polls. It is not true because he fronted former Mutomo MP Isaac Muoki, who was running against me in Wiper primaries,&rdquo; Malombe said.He said they only worked together after they were both nominated to run for governor and senator, respectively.Musila is also running for governor. He and Malombe will do battle in the Wiper primaries on Monday.In his campaigns, Musila has apologised to Kitui residents several times for convincing them to vote for Malombe in 2013.
