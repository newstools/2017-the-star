ODM has resolved to embrace consensus in primaries for hotly contested seats with two or more strong competitors in a bid to stop violence and push for unity.&ldquo;All [aspirants] are our members and we are talking so that we can have a solution to move forward as a strong team even after the primaries,&rdquo; secretary general Agnes Zani said yesterday at ODM headquarters.Among the counties that have experienced heightened tension are Nairobi, Kisumu, Busia, Homa Bay, Migori and Siaya. The counties are believed to have many strong candidates, and have been branded hotspots for the primaries.&ldquo;We are very democratic and in future, we should have primaries a year before elections to popularises the candidate and ensure the process remains free and fair,&rdquo; Zani said.She said the party will analyse its data, audit the results and engage the candidates in dialogue.&ldquo;Auditing the data and talking to the aspirants remain our two valuable options. That means we will not give any results unless we have the final results,&rdquo; Zani said.Yesterday, the nominations were held in the Nyamira, Kajiado, Nakuru, Trans Nzoia and Taita Taveta counties.Zani said the exercise in Trans Nzoia, Taita Taveta and Nyamira kicked off late due to the mix-up in the distribution of ballot boxes and heavy rains.&ldquo;In Taita Taveta, there were media reports criminals attempted to raid Mwatate CDF Hall where election materials had been stored, but security personnel moved in with speed and repelled them,&rdquo; Zani said.In Nakuru, she said the National Elections Board learnt the name of one of the MP aspirants for Nakuru Town West was missing on the ballot paper, and has therefore postponed the primaries.She said ODM register will be used in the nomination exercise. &ldquo;We want to make it clear that returning officers and presiding officers have been instructed by the National Elections Board to ensure that this is adhered to, and that nobody should be denied to vote as long as they have their identity cards and their names are on the register,&rdquo; Zani said.ODM postponed primaries in Mombasa, Kilifi, Kwale, Tana River and Lamu to Saturday.
