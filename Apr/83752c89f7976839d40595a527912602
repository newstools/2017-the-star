Governor Samuel Tunai has dismissed claims that Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto&rsquo;s Chama Cha Mashinani is popular in Narok.He said Rutto&rsquo;s frequent visits to Narok to popularise CCM have been &ldquo;an exercise in futility&rdquo;.Tunai on Tuesday said Narok is a battleground for ODM and Jubilee, and the county&rsquo;s top job is a two-horse race between them. He spoke in Maji Moto in Narok South constituency.&ldquo;CCM is only an escort to others. This county is a Jubilee zone. We will campaign in every corner of the county to ensure all seats go to Jubilee,&rdquo; Tunai said.Tunai, the Jubilee flagbearer, will face Narok West MP Patrick Ntutu of CCM and former ICT PS Joseph Tiampati of ODM. He told his rivals to prepare for a bruising battle. He said his administration has a development record to rely on.&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t compare what the county government has done for the people of Narok with the previous regime&rsquo;s works. This includes education, roads, agriculture and other sectors. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m seeking reelection,&rdquo; Tunai said.He said he has served residents without discrimination, despite Narok having people from many ethnic groups. But Rutto on Tuesday said CCM is the party to watch in the South Rift and is now replacing old URP.At the weekend, he held a series of rallies in Sogoo, Chebirbelek, Triangle, Olmegenyu and Rongena in Narok, where he drummed up support for his party and hopefuls. Rutto said CCM has fielded governor candidates in Nakuru and Narok.The party&rsquo;s goal is to uplift the downtrodden in society, he said.CCM is open to supporting a presidential candidate who commits to devolving at least 45 per cent of the national revenues to the counties. &ldquo;Public resources must be shared equally and as CCM we shall not stop at anything. Whoever needs our support should agree to that fact,&rdquo; Rutto said.
