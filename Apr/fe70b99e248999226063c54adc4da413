Ulinzi handball teams (men and women) will use the forthcoming Kenya Defence Forces league to reinforce their squads ahead of this year&rsquo;s Kenya Handball Federation national league.KDF league is set to resume April 25-27 at the Embakasi grounds and Nyayo Stadium courts respectively. The league, which was last staged in 2014 before taking a break only attracts teams from the Kenya Defence Forces.Speaking on Sunday at the Nyayo Stadium after his team Ulinzi failed to retain the KHF Super League Cup title, team manager Sammy Mwangangi confirmed plans are underway to have a successful 3-day event. Ulinzi succumbed to fast-improving Strathmore University 23-25 in the final as Nairobi Water retained the title for the third time after a deserved 32-18 win against National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB). Mwangangi said the 3-day event will help coaches attached to Ulinzi reinforce their squads ahead of the new season. &ldquo;If the Super League performance is anything to go by, then we should brave ourselves for a competitive 2017 season. With teams like NCPB and Black Mamba failing to go past semi-final stage, this is a sign that the sport is becoming competitive,&rdquo; said Mwangangi.He continued: &ldquo;Thanks to the new chairman Brigadier Isaack Muchendu support, now the KDF league will be running annually. With such development, we can only build strong squads which will challenge for title in the regular league and any other upcoming International assignment.&rdquo;Ulinzi men are the defending KHF national league champions while their female counterparts finished runners up last season, behind Nairobi Water.
