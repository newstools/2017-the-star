Just last week, the Conservation Alliance succeeded in legally halting the proposed standard gauge railway (SGR) project in the interim, and are now acting to ensure all work is stopped within the park. It is our hope and prayer that millions of Kenyans and people who care about Kenya now declare &ldquo;enough is enough &rdquo; and rise up to excellence by conserving and protecting Kenya&rsquo;s priceless natural treasures.What does priceless mean? Simply speaking, a priceless treasure is a treasure that is so valuable and unique and precious that no money or item of value can replace it. The Nairobi National Park is such a place. What if this was 2046, the 100th year of the Nairobi National Park? Would it be a moment of great celebration or merely a sober moment of reflecting on the sad lost past?If this current generation does not act now to stop destructive developments in the park, by finding alternative solutions for roads and railways and securing the remaining migration routes and ecosystems, then the Nairobi National Park will be reduced to a mere fraction of a reduced &ldquo;green island&rdquo; in an ocean of concrete. In just over a century, Nairobi has grown rapidly into a huge city, possibly home to over 12 million people by 2050. KWS continues to manage, but they need more help! God has put many wonderful treasures on this earth, and the Nairobi Park is a priceless treasure that needs to be kept for future generations. 2017 will prove to be a critical year in the history of the Nairobi National Park. Concerned citizens and environmental organisations need to act and assist! Why not make history today?The park is open daily from 06h00 to 19h00.For more information on the park you can link to the following websites www.kws.org or www.nairobigreenline.com or on Facebook &ndash; Nairobi National Park
