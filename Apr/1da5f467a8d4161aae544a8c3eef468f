Kenya and Switzerland yesterday signed a deal to trace and recover stolen assets and funds stashed in Swiss accounts.The agreement is between the Attorney General&rsquo;s office and the Swiss Federal Office. It will facilitate the cooperation in investigating and prosecuting individuals involved in trans-border economic crimes between the two states.This could lead to the recovery of billions of shillings allegedly hidden in Swiss accounts and result in the prosecution of the individuals involved. &ldquo;The signing of the MoU goes a long way in reassuring Kenyans that the days of thieves are numbered. You can run, but you no longer have a hiding place,&rdquo; AG Githu Mugai said during the signing of the agreement at the KICC.Switzerland has for a long time been the preferred haven for corruptly acquired funds and assets by Kenyan government officials and businesspeople dealing in illegal activities.Part of the funds stolen through the infamous Anglo Leasing and Goldenberg scandals were allegedly hidden in Swiss accounts.International legal barriers have often hampered efforts to recover the funds. &ldquo;In future, it will be harder to benefit from corruption in Kenya and in Switzerland,&rdquo; Swiss ambassador to Kenya Ralf Heckner said after signing the MoU on behalf of his government.He said the agreement serves to send a message to corrupt individuals in Kenya that Switzerland is no longer a haven to hide their money.Heckner confirmed that the Swiss government has frozen Sh200 million related to the Anglo Leasing scandal.Muigai said he will in the next two weeks travel to China and after that to the UK with the aim of concluding similar bilateral agreements designed to fighting transnational crimes.Key areas of cooperation will include assets recovery and the repatriation of criminals and their proceeds, he said.
