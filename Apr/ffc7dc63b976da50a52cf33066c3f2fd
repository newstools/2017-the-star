Rift Valley Railways, the struggling operator of the Kenya-Uganda railway, insists it was in discussion with &ldquo;several&rdquo; investors for the proposed sale of controlling stake by Egypt&rsquo;s Qalaa Holdings. This follows the decision by Emerging Capital Partners, pan-African private equity firm, to pull the plug on negotiations to acquire Qalaa&rsquo;s 80 per cent stake in RVR. &ldquo;As far as RVR is concerned, ECP has been involved in due diligence of RVR business through their agents which due diligence is ongoing,&rdquo; RVR Group CEO Isaiah Okoth said in a statement. &ldquo;RVR is currently reviewing its various options and is in close communication with both KRC [Kenya Railways Corporation] and URC [Uganda Railways Corporation] with a view to achieving the best possible outcome to all the railway stakeholders.&rdquo;
