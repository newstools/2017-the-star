Gender-based violence remains one of the worst violations of human rights, with women as the victims and survivors, Gender CS Sicily Kariuki has said. She spoke during the just-concluded Commission of Status of Women&rsquo;s conference in New York, US. The Kenyan delegation called for increased funding, collaborations, partnerships and legal frameworks on gender equality. Kariuki recognised that significant progress has been made, but gaps persist and undermine realisation of gender parity. &ldquo;For instance, achieving the Sustainable Development Goal Five may be a dream if our women are expected to remain unpaid labourers in family-owned farms or in the informal sector in the next decade. They will be deprived of social protection and prospects of development from their status,&rdquo; she said.
