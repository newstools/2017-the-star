More than 70,000 people are yet to return to their homes in the Kerio Valley where KDF and other security agencies are trying to flush out bandits. Villages along the border between Elgeyo Marakwet, West Pokot and Baringo counties have been deserted for five months, as bandits ruled the region. On March 17, President Uhuru Kenyatta finally deployed KDF to counties striken by drought and invasions of herders, bandits and poachers. In three weeks, KDF and other agencies have repulsed more than 12 major attacks in the Kerio Valley. The government says the KDF operation is restoring peace and stability. The attacks claimed 75 lives and displaced 300,000 residents over five months. Elgeyo Marakwet deputy county commissioner Eric Mulevu said banditry has declined and the government is using both the military operation and diplomacy to restore security. “We have managed to stop many attacks that would have caused problems. We are also talking to communities using elders and other players so that we can put in place mechanisms for lasting peace,” Mulevu said. He said the security agencies, including KDF, have set up bases in strategic points to drive out bandits. In the last three weeks, weeks, only “minor cattle theft incidents” havebeen reported, he said. But NGOs Council chairman Stephen Cheboisaid more than 300,000 displaced people may not be able to vote in the polls on August 8. Deputy President William Ruto and Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet are to visit the region next week to asses the situation. Last week, State House spokesman Manoah Esipisu in Eldoret said it was evident the security operation is succeeding. “We can all feel the security situation is getting better,” he said.
