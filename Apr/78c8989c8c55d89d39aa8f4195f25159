Some aspirants in Kisumu have rejected the current ODM county elections board headed by lawyer Geoffrey Yogo.They demanded that the party constitutes a new board, preferably with persons of integrity, drawn from neighbouring counties. They are against having what they termed already compromised and known activists in the primaries.Kisumu Governor Jack Ranguma, MPs Onyango Koyoo (Muhoroni), James Nyikal (Seme) and Shakeel Shabbir (Kisumu East) proposed that board members be drawn from Western or other regions.In a signed press statement on Saturday, the politicians said the current board with members Yogo, Kennedy Ajwang&rsquo; (Jege Jege) and Monica Akong&rsquo;o should be disbanded.
