The journey has just began. I urge my opponent Mtengo to join hands with me to ensure we win the seat on August 8," she said.Mtengo was not present at the tallying centre to receive the news.He dismissed the results and urged ODM to nullify them and call for fresh nominations as there were massive irregularities.Addressing a press conference in his office, Mtengo said ODM was not prepared for the exercise and that is why it lacked transparency.&ldquo;We might go as independent candidate, or might help Phillip Charo. We will make sure Aisha Jumwa does not become the MP for Malindi," he said.Jumwa will be given the nomination certificate this morning.Mtengo blamed Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi for not intervening to help address the issues raised.&ldquo;If Kingi won't intervene we are prepared and will take our stand somewhere else," he said.Mtengo has served as Malindi MP for one year.
