First Lady Margaret Kenyatta will join thousands of women at the Kasarani International Sports Centre for interdenominational prayers on Saturday.The national prayers are expected to draw faithful and &ldquo;prayer warriors&rdquo; from across the country as did the first round of similar prayers last month held at the St. Andrew&rsquo;s PCEA Church, Nairobi where the First Lady was the Chief Guest.Although the prayers are organized under the aegis of the National Assembly Lady Spouses Association of Kenya (Nalsa-K) in liaison with women from the PCEA church, they are expected to bring together representatives from all faiths including muslims.Tomorrow&rsquo;s prayers coincide with the Easter season and their focus is likely to centre on thanksgiving, forgiveness and peaceful general elections in August.During the prayers at the St Andrews, the prayer warriors implored God for peaceful polls besides petitioning Him to save the family from domestic violence, drugs and addiction.The women made further supplications to God asking for an end to runaway corruption across various institutions including the church, unnecessary killings occasioned by road accidents, homicides and abortion.Ethnic violence, witchcraft among politicians seeking elective posts, broken covenants (agreements and MOUs), oppression of the weak and unhealthy competition for leadership positions were the other key issues that dominated the first round of the national prayers.
