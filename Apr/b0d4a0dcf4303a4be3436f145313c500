A list of preferred candidates and destruction of election materials yesterday led to the postponement of ODM Primaries in Nairobi.A presiding officer in one of the polling stations yesterday told the Star that a senior official in the National Elections Board had a list of preferred candidates.The list was submitted to the branch election officials, who were instructed to ensure they emerged victorious.&ldquo;The chairman rejected and asked the board to conduct elections on their own,&rdquo; the officer said.This led to some aspirants, who had learned of the list of candidates, to storm a warehouse, where the nomination materials were being kept and destroyed the papers. But addressing the press at Orange House, secretary general Agnes Zani said the elections were called off due to security issues and logistical challenges. She did not give more details.The party cancelled the exercise early yesterday morning. It did not give a new date for the exercise.Aspirants and party supporters who had thronged polling stations in several parts of the city, expressed disappointment with the postponement.&ldquo;We are very disappointed with the party. We took the day off from our jobs to come and vote only to be told the exercise has been postponed,&rdquo; voter Titus Muga in Sarang&rsquo;ombe ward, Kibra constituency, said.MCA aspirant in the area Bildad Odero registered his disappointment, saying he has spent cash mobilising supporters, only for the exercise to be cancelled in the last minute.&ldquo;We know there might have been some unseen logistical challenges that might have led to the postponement. But we are still hopeful the party will soon announce another date for the nominations,&rdquo; he said.At St Teresa Primary School in Pangani, voters complained of the late cancellation. Some said they spent the night at the polling station waiting for the exercise to start at 6am. &ldquo;This is unacceptable. We cannot spend the night here and leave our work only to be told that the exercise has been cancelled and no reasons given,&rdquo; another voter saod.Meanwhile, Zani has dismissed claims they have issued certificates to &ldquo;preferred candidates&rdquo;.
