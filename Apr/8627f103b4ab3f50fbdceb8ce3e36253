Kenya is considering the use of Chinese therapy for malaria treatment as &ldquo;it has almost eliminated the disease in China and the Comoros&rdquo;. Health CS Cleopa Mailu yesterday said they are still consulting about the artemisinin-based therapy, which can prevent recurrence. &ldquo;The lesson learnt through implementation of collaboration in the programme, which we&rsquo;ll have with China, is that it improves the use of this drug towards eradicating malaria,&rdquo; Mailu said in Nairobi at a symposium on malaria eradication in Africa. Application of Fast Elimination of Malaria by Source Eradication in the Comoros Islands in 2006 achieved great success. It had many cases at six per cent of its population. This dropped significantly, saving it about Sh1.1 billion of its health budget. Chinese remedies are often opposed by Western pharmaceuticals.
