A 65-year-old man who battered his inherited wife after she threatened to end the relationship will serve a five-year jail term after losing an appeal. High Court judge Aaron Makau said the sentence against Moses Wafula Barasa was lenient given the serious injuries he inflicted on his wife. He termed the attack an act of violence against women. The judge said his imprisonment is a clear message to would-be inheritors that courts would not tolerate violence against women. “He did not only intend to inflict pain and suffering on her, but he either intended to cause grievous harm to her, which he did or intended to kill her,” Makau said. Wafula was charged with causing grievous harm to Jackeline Ahenda on January 28, 2016, at Simur sublocation in Ugenya subcounty, Siaya. Wafula attacked her with a panga. She then told him she had had enough and would end their marriage. Wafula who has been in custody since February 2016 asked the court to reduce the sentence due to his old age and poor health. “I am the sole breadwinner of a family that fully depends on me,” he said.
