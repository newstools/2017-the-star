Lower Eastern residents will have to wait longer for Thwake Dam to be constructed, following a pending court appeal and MPs breaking for a recess. The National Assembly Agriculture committee, which has been probing the matter, asked Water CS Eugene Wamalwa to appear before it last week.The CS was to explain how the government intends to settle the matter and have the dam constructed on time, but he did not appear, pleading that a handover process was ongoing at his ministry.The National Assembly went into recess on Thursday. It is unclear how much time is left for the probe, given the short time remaining before Parliament dissolves to pave way for the August election.The committee is reportedly determined to arrive at substantive findings to expedite implementation of the controversial project.Former Irrigation PS Patrick Mwangi was transferred from the ministry, in a move widely seen to have been precipitated by unresolved differences with Wamalwa.Mwangi had awarded the tender to a Chinese company Sino Hydro STECOL, which did not post the lowest bid. It remains to be seen whether the transfer will help.Sino Hydro STECOL put in a Sh36.9 billion bid, while another Chinese firm, Gezhouba, had Sh36.6 billion, a lower bid.Gezhouba&rsquo;s bid appears to have been adjudged non-responsive by the Ministry Tender Committee because it reportedly used the experience and credentials of associated companies that were debarred by the AfDB at the prequalification stage and disentitled by the World Bank from tender opening until June 28.Gezhouba has contested the tender award, a move likely to stall the project further. AfDB is financing 35 per cent of the project.
