ODM nominations in Narok, Turkana and Kakamega were delayed on Saturday following hitches with members' registers.Voters whose names were not in the lists were turned away.The primaries were to begin at 8am but ballot papers had not been taken to some polling stations by 11am.In Kakamega, Lurambi MP Raphael Otaalo said he was disappointed with the manner in which the entire exercise was conducted.Otalo claimed there was a "hidden agenda" to rig some of the candidates in.He said some returning officers went away from stations, leaving ballot papers unattended.In Samburu, members registers for 24 polling stations were reported missing.One of the returning officers was forced to go to a nearby cyber cafe to print the register after hundreds of voters were left stranded."The 40 polling stations have been merged into two," the source said, adding one comprised 25 stations and the other 15.The exercise started at noon after the merger consensus was reached.ODM communications director Philip Etale was not available for comment on the matter of missing registers.
