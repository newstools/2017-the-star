Nairobi woman representative Rachel Shebesh has said she is running for reelection to motivate women to stand up against male chauvinism, which dominates politics.She announced her bid yesterday at the Kasarani Stadium. Shebesh will face seven other women for the Jubilee Party ticket.Those who have presented their nomination papers to the party headquarters include Millicent Omanga, Karen Nyamu and Wangui Nganga.&ldquo;I want to tell men in the political arena that if you think you are going to fight a woman and despise her as she seeks to vie for an elective post, then you are wrong. We are going to deal with you, regardless of the party because we also have a right to lead,&rdquo; Shebesh said. She defended her track record in her first term as the first Nairobi woman rep. Shebesh said she pushed for the decentralisation of funds to help persons living with disability. She vowed to push for more funds for disabled children.
