Residents were in shock after a man's rotting body was found in a sugarcane plantation in South Kamagambo village, Rongo on Saturday.Joseph Ogoi's body was found without two arms and a leg, leading residents to believe he may have been killed elsewhere then dumped in the plantation.The 65-year-old was reported missing on March 17 by his younger brother after a disagreement with a woman he inherited from the area.Samuel Okemo said his brother had a long-standing domestic problem with the unidentified woman and attempts to reconcile them failed.&ldquo;Each time I tried to make peace between them they often lived temporarily before problem flared again,&rdquo; Okemo said."The last time he went missing is after he tried to set his lover's house ablaze," he added.Okemo said the woman was unwilling to report the incident. He also said police refused to cooperate when he reported his brother missing.A neighbour said that the couple had fights that revolved around their drinking habits "as both of them were drunkards"."Their fight got worse when the woman started selling alcohol in her home and the man accused her customers of having an affair with her,&rdquo; he said.He said the day Ogoi disappeared, he had come to the house with two 40-litre jerrycans of petrol to set the house ablaze. But his attempts failed as villagers put off the fire in time.Rongo police boss Jonathan Kisaka said they are investigating the incident and will question the woman.The body was taken to Rosewood Hospital in Rongo town.
