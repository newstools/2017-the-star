Central Bank governor Patrick Njoroge has challenged commercial banks to support green energy initiatives, as the country gears towards building a strong pool for financing renewable energy projects.This is ahead of the planned &lsquo;green&rsquo; bond set to be issued this year. The Kenya Bankers Association and the Nairobi Securities Exchange are planning to issue the country&rsquo;s first green bond in the third quarter of 2017.The proceeds will be used to finance projects in the renewable energy, energy-efficiency, green transport and wastewater treatment sectors. Speaking during a workshop on Sustainable Use of Natural Resources and Energy Financing by Agence Fran&ccedil;aise de D&eacute;veloppement and the Kenya Association of Manufacturers, Njoroge asked banks to give affordable loans among other incentives to green compliant institutions. &ldquo;The ongoing success of AFD&rsquo;s SUNREF programme should be an eye-opener for Kenyan banks to diversify into green energy financing because of the growth potential in the renewable energy and energy efficiency sectors,&rdquo; Njoroge said.KAM chief executive Phyllis Wakiaga said increased production and use of renewable energy will help cut the cost of production by manufacturers, who are still grappling with a high cost of energy.KAM has been working closely with AFD&rsquo;s SUNREF to improve the quality of renewable energy and energy efficiency technology in the country. The two have built a project portfolio of over 250 projects in hydro, solar, biogas, biomass and energy efficiency and energy service companies, and financed 16 projects to the tune of $58 million(about Sh5.99 billion) since 2011.&ldquo;There are still many opportunities available to improve on the quality of renewable energy and energy efficiency technology which will ultimately reduce the cost of production and increase competitiveness,&rdquo; Wakiaga said.
