The first thing Environment CS Judi Wakhungu bumps into each day in the morning when being chauffeured into her office are plastics littered around streets, hanging from tree branches and clogging water drainage systems.Wakhungu, who holds a PhD in energy resources management, is simply disheartened. To address the menace, she has banned plastic carrier bags through a gazette notice dated February 27.For her, the ban should have been imposed like yesterday since discussions have been going on for 10 years."People complain about air quality but nobody complains about plastic bags as pollutants. It is not true that we have not consulted the Kenya Association of Manufacturers. I met them personally on February 24 and told them I was going to gazette the notice. So they are aware, and the evidence is there."Wakhungu said "nobody can doubt the fact that plastic bags are pollutants", as they are non-biodegradable.She notified the public that six months from February 27 (in September), the use, manufacture and importation of all plastic bags used for commercial and household packaging will be banned.Manufacturers and importers are required to stop providing plastic, single-use carrier bags to customers by August 28. Furthermore, all manufacturers and importers shall declare all their remaining stocks by the due date to Nema for further action.To support the ban, Treasury has allocated Sh3.8 billion for environment management and protection.While presenting the 2017-18 budget on March 30, Treasury CS Henry Rotich said through the ban, the government aims to fight pollution and preserve the environment.Illegal and rushed?This has not gone down well with some quarters. The Kenya Association of Manufactures condemned the ban as "illegal and rushed".KAM CEO Phyllis Wakiaga said the ban will hurt 176 plastic manufacturing companies and more than 60,000 employees."Since I came into office,they have been meeting quarterly but we were just being taken round and round as the issue was getting worse,"she says.Wakhungu said her ministry and KAM "are not adversaries but are closely working together to find lasting solutions"."When the Gazette notice was published, the head of the plastics section called me and I told them that we will meet with them next week, when I will be in Nairobi," she said.According to KAM, more than 176 plastic manufacturing companies, which directly employ 2.89 per cent of all Kenyan employees and indirectly employ over 60,000 people, are set to be affected.Manufacturers also criticised the six-month window provided for the ban to take effect, saying it is inadequate as the companies cannot close down production and clear their stocks within that period.However, Wakhungu maintained that the window of six months is enough.She said from September, those found with plastic bags will be fined between Sh1 million and Sh4 million, jailed for one to four years or both.The CS's stance has been backed by the National Environment Complaints Committee, which said plastics have been an eyesore in not only urban but also rural areas."Fifty per cent of the complaints we receive per year are on solid waste management, in particular plastics," NECC secretary John Juma said.Plastic bags remain a big problem, especially to developing countries. As countries such as Kenya develop, people's lifestyles change as they gain access to supermarkets, purchasing packaged foods previously too expensive for them.Struggling economies such as Kenya also lack the funds and technology to dispose of plastics bags.Collective responsibility Rwanda is now one of the cleanest countries in Africa after it banned plastic bags in 2008.In Kenya, however, one is still likely to see plastic bags around streets, hanging from tree branches and clogging water drainage systems. The ban in September could change this.In Rwanda, leaders have remained committed to the cause. The citizens too have taken the initiative of sprucing up their country through Umuganda, community work that is mandatory for every able Rwandan between 18 and 65 years old.If a person is above 65 years and is willing to work, they are allowed to participate. Expatriates are also encouraged to participate in community work, which takes place every last Saturday of every month.Jared Bosire, country director for conservation at the World Wildlife Fund, says for the ban to be successful, it is not only the government that should lead but every individual and organisation."Kenyans have bad manners of eating something and throwing the plastic bag anywhere, that is extremely irresponsible," he says, adding that Kenyans normally complain of the government not doing a lot.Bosire says even though people will lose jobs, there will never be change that does not cost."If we look at how much plastics have contributed to garbage and how much they kill fish and sea turtles when they end up in the sea, then the country has made the right decision," he says.Search for an alternative Supermarkets are now coming to terms with the looming ban and scrambling for an alternative to plastic carrier bags.The available options are paper bags, clothing bags, sisal bags, papyrus bags and buyers' or shoppers' own shopping bags.Most supermarkets were found flat-footed, with tonnes and tonnes of plastic bags in their stores.Two of the leading supermarkets, Naivas and Nakumatt, say they support the move and are now planning to find an alternative."We support the efforts to have a clean environment. We will have to look for an alternative," Naivas chief operating officer Willy Kimani said.He said they will find ways of getting a solution as it is costly to immediately look for options.Kimani said they are now looking for reusable bags such as gunny bags.Nakumatt chief marketing officer Andrew Dixon said they support the ban, terming it progressive.He said they do not support a blanket ban where alternative options are not provided.Dixon said neither have they seen any concerted public education e&#64256;ort by the government to manage the problem at hand."Much more focus needs to be employed in an integrated waste management process," he said.Dixon said e&#64256;ecting a ban on plastic bags leads to an inadvertent switch to pulp paper bags. However, such pulp paper bags require 70 per cent more energy to manufacture and produce 50 per cent more greenhouse gas emissions. They also create five times more waste than plastic bags.He said the six-month window given to do away with plastic bags is su&#64259;cient for them.Nakumatt facilitates the dispensing of more than 350,000 plastic carry bags daily across the region.This is just a tip of the iceberg, as it does not cover millions of plastic bags and pouches that pack milk, bread and other essential daily produce in the formal and informal retail space.Dixon said in their estimation, more than a million plastic paper bags are dispensed through informal avenues such as small shops, agricultural produce markets, milk parlours and butcheries.He said it is for this reason that Nakumatt, though e&#64256;ectively a minority player in this process, has taken the bull by the horns.&ldquo;We believe that through the Nakumatt Think Green; Go Blue campaign, we shall encourage at least a million shoppers to reduce their use of plastic bags and accept goods packed in papers bags, reusable bags and even paper bales.&rdquo;For him, the alternative lies in the adoption and use of reusable bags,Dixon says that consumers have long been ignored in a product cycle that is highly dependent on them.&ldquo;Use of reusable bags is an e&#64256;ective way to instil discipline and ownership among consumers. Reusable bags are also more environmentally friendly than plastic or paper bags&rdquo;.Nakumatt normally places an order of more than 10 million plastic bags monthly.This is done through a number of local suppliers or manufacturers, including Plastic Industries Limited and Bobmil.Nakumatt has been giving its customers alternative packaging options which they sell, but most shoppers opt for free plastic bags.Bosire said what is needed is attitude change. He said some supermarkets in Europe do not provide packaging bags, meaning one has to go with one when doing shopping. This can be copied in Kenya, he said.WWF for several years has been helping communities to recycle plastics, using them for value addition and make products which they can sell and get income.Bosire said when wildlife eat plastic bags, they are not broken down, hence are likely to kill them.
