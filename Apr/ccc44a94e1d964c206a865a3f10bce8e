An 18-year-old girl whose medical condition was highlighted by the Star newspaper and later admitted to Kenyatta National Hospital has been diagnosed with Rhabdomyosacorma.This type of cancer is made up of cells that normally develop into skeletal muscles.&ldquo;The biopsy result done last week confirmed my suspicion that she has Rhabdomyosacorma, the alveolar type,&rdquo; Oral cranio and maxillofacial surgeon Edwin Rono said.The alveolar type tends to occur within skeletal muscles and is postulated to derive from precursor cells within the skeletal muscle.It typically affects all age groups equally. It contributes to a larger portion of this type of cancer in children and teens than in younger children.Muansia Lenjoye was admitted to KNH on April 6.Rono said she will be taken through two cycles of chemotherapy, which will help the team of specialists looking after the girl determine the date of removing the bulk of the tumour.This will be based on whether she is responding to the chemotherapy treatment. &ldquo;We are going to start with chemotherapy to reduce the swelling on her face. If I remove the tumour before doing chemotherapy, I will not be able to tell if the tumour has reduced in size or not,&rdquo; Rono said.The tumour has occupied almost half of the girl&rsquo;s face. It has severely destroyed her upper left jaw and extended to her left eye. Rono says her health has improved since she was admitted.&ldquo;She is doing very well. She was even moving around during the weekend,&rdquo; he said.During admission, Lenjoye was very weak and had lost a lot of weight because she was not eating properly.This will not be the first time that Lenjoye will be operated on. Her family&rsquo;s first attempt to remove the tumour was in Muhimbili Hospital in Tanzania through the help of a well-wisher, who catered for all the expenses. She has been living with the tumour for a year.
