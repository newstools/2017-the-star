Runyenjes MP Cecily Mbarire and several other Embu aspirants have boycotted the Jubilee nominations citing numerous anomalies.Mbarire, who is eying the governor seat currently held by Martin Wambora, said the primaries should be cancelled over the irregularities.She led other aspirants to storm Kirimari Secondary School where ballot boxes and papers for Manyatta Constituency were being distributed.MP aspirants John Muchiri (Manyatta), Godfrey Kingangi (Mbeere South), and Deputy speaker Ibrahim Swaleh accompanied Mbarire. Justus Mugo - Union of Kenya Civil Servants national treasurer and woman representative aspirant Jane Wanjuki were also present. Kirimari ward aspirant Morris Muchiri also claimed that his name was not on the ballot papers.Mbarire declared that there will be no election owing to the six hours delay and for lack of enough ballot papers.She said some of the boxes did not have seals and some names of some aspirants were missing.They also demanded the party to recall the boxes and ballots that had been distributed until new dates are set. Hundreds of people had gathered at the polling stations but were disappointed over the delays.Distribution of the items to polling stations in Runyenjes, Manyatta, Mbeere North and South started after 9am."This is very disappointing. We did not expect a party of Jubilee's status to have disorganised polls." "It appears the party was not ready for the polls," Mbarire told journalists at Kirimari secondary school on Friday.Jubilee Party primaries were cancelled indefinitely in most counties on Friday following an acute shortage of ballot papers.This happened despite JP secretariat chairman Raphael Tuju reaffirming that the primaries have not been cancelled.Elgeyo Marakwet, Baringo, Kirinyaga, Murang'a and several parts of Nakuru were affected.Read: Anxiety as primaries cancelled indefinitely in key Jubilee Party strongholdsAlso read: Resign for 'spoiling Jubilee Party', Keter tells DP Ruto office's staff
