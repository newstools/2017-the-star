Kenya Red Cross Society secretary general Abass Gullet yesterday said he had no direct role to play in the contract between the Emergency Medical Services and the Garissa government that led to the lease of seven ambulances.&ldquo;My role as the chairman was oversight. I was not directly involved in the drafting of the agreement,&rdquo; he said.Gullet testified before Garissa chief magistrate Cosmas Maundu in a case in which Governor Nathif Jama and six former Tender Committee members are charged with irregular leasing of ambulances from the Red Cross.Gullet said the EMS is an independent entity and runs its own day-to-day activities.When asked if he counterchecked the draft agreement during the cross examination that took roughly 10 minutes in a packed court, Gullet said, &ldquo;There was no reason to countercheck. It was not my business.&rdquo;He said he signed the agreement with Jama but did go into the details of the agreement.Already five witnesses have testified in the case.On Monday, Mohammed Barre, the former head of procurement, said the leasing of the ambulances was necessitated by dire humanitarian need in the county.&ldquo;A baseline survey carried out by the Health department at the time showed there was high mortally rate and there was an urgent need for ambulances,&rdquo; he said.Barre, who was the first prosecution witness, said St John Ambulance and the Red Cross quoted Sh550,000 and Sh600,000, respectively, during the evaluation process.&ldquo;The Procurement department resolved to go for the Kenya Red Cross since it had advantages, including two paramedics whose salaries and allowances are catered for by the Kenya Red Cross ... The Red Cross [also] maintained the ambulances,&rdquo; he said.Former EACC regional head Abraham Kemboi is set to testify tomorrow.Jama&rsquo;s co-accused are Rahma Dekow, Jawahir Keinan, Abdi Sahal, Safia Mohamed, Mohamed Hassan and Mohamud Hassan Mohamed.
