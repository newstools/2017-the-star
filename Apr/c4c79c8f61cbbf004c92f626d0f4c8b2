The CoG will Thursday host the Kakamega edition of the governors&rsquo; gender round table. The event at Bukhungu Stadium brings together women, people living with disability and youths to discuss gender equity and equality and women&rsquo;s empowerment at work.&ldquo;The forum is geared towards tracking the gains of women, youth and people living with disability in the process of planning, budgeting, implementation of projects and tracking within the counties,&rdquo; CoG director of communications Andrew Teiye said.The meeting comes as MPs are under pressure to implement laws to operationalise the two-thirds gender rule.On March 29, the High Court directed Parliament to enact the gender law within 60 days, failing which any Kenyan will have a right to petition the court to declare Parliament unconstitutional.President Uhuru Kenyatta last week told majority leader Aden Duale to prioritise the gender bill when Parliament resumes. Teiye said governors will showcase their victories during the meet.
