Internationally renowned conservationist Kuki Gallmann yesterday was shot by raiders, 37 days since President Uhuru Kenyatta deployed the KDF in Laikipia.Gallman, 73, famous for her memoir, I Dreamed of Africa, was shot in the stomach while on patrol in her Laikipia Nature Conservancy ranch.The Italian-born Kenyan was flown to the Aga Khan Hospital, Nairobi.This comes barely a month after Sosian ranch co-owner Tristan Voorspuy was shot dead by raiders while inspecting his lodges in Laikipia North.Four people, including an MP, have been arrested and charged in court in connection with his murder.ODM leader Raila Odinga condemned the attack and demanded action to restore order before things get out of control.&ldquo;Kuki, like other conservancy owners being subjected to brutality in Laikipia, is part and parcel of the Kenyan nation regardless of her origin,&rdquo; he said in a statement yesterday, wishing her quick recovery.&ldquo;She has contributed tremendously to the growth of our country in general and northern Kenya in particular. These ranch owners deserve protection under the law like all Kenyans.&rdquo;Nyahururu police boss Ezekiel Chepkwony said Gallman was rushed to a hospital in Nanyuki town for first aid before she was airlifted to Nairobi hospital. He said her driver also survived the attack.&ldquo;Security officers overpowered the heavily armed herders who escaped with gunshot wounds. Our officers are pursuing the bandits and we&rsquo;ll bring them to book,&rdquo; Chepkwony told the Star on the phone.A security guard at the ranch said the conservationist was shot by herders who had managed to enter her compound.&ldquo;The herders had burnt down several buildings on the conservancy and had also been firing bullets at us [staff], as they moved closer to our houses. They attacked her few metres from her house at around 9am, when she was patrolling the ranch,&rdquo; the guard said.Early this month, herders burnt down the Mukutane Lodge situated in 100,000 acres on the Laikipia-Baringo border. They shot at Gallaman&rsquo;s daughter Sveva Gallmann, popularly known as Makena, who was caught up in the attack. She escaped unhurt.The herders claim they have been on a revenge mission against military operation. They said Gallman was encouraging security officers to shoot at their livestock, claims Gallman had dismissed.
