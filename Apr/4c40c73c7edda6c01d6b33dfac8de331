Guests at President Uhuru Kenyatta's Kisumu function scampered for safety after a snake appeared at the dais.The small grass snake, which is non-venomous and popularly found in the lake region, caused a commotion after a guest spotted it at Kisumu State Lodge.Several VIPs, among them Sports CS Hassan Wario and Nominated Senator Joy Gwendo, left their seats upon hearing about the reptile.Police officers attached to the presidential guard speedily captured and killed the snake.Uhuru had not yet arrived to preside over the 58th National Drama Festivals State Concert.Business on Kisumu's Oginga Odinga Street came to a stand still as residents lined up, eagerly waiting for the President.Some noted Uhuru rarely goes to the lakeside; he last visited Kisumu, a stronghold of Opposition Chief Raila Odinga, in February 2016.But other businesses went on as usual, the proprietors saying Uhuru "comes and goes".ODM's political affairs secretary Opiyo Wandayi, who is Ugunja MP, laughed off the visit terming it belated and non-beneficial.More on this: Kisumu gives Uhuru rousing welcome, Wandayi says visit half-hearted, pointless
