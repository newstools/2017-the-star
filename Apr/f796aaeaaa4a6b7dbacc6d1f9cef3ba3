Safaricom risks being fined up to 0.1 per cent of its gross annual turnover for poor quality of service after its network failed yesterday.The Communication Authority said it has sought an explanation from Safaricom over the outage experienced on its network affecting its voice, data, SMS, M-Pesa and enterprise services for more than two hours.CA director general Francis Wangusi said the regulator will take action on Safaricom if the downtime was a result of its technical failure.&ldquo;We are waiting to get an explanation of what happened. We should not have a communication breakdown in the country. If it was a deliberate move, we are going to take action,&rdquo; Wangusi told journalists at the CA headquarters.Safaricom CEO Bob Collymore said, &ldquo;Our engineers identified the root cause of the outage, which was a failure on both our core network as well as our redundancy options. Our team worked as quickly as possible to resolve the issue and invoked our business continuity planning protocol to restore services and the incident was marked as closed at 4.30pm.&rdquo;According to CA, all telecommunication services should guarantee a 99.9 per cent delivery. &ldquo;We cannot tolerate a downtime of more than one hour,&rdquo; Wangusi said. Safaricom admitted having a system outage which affected services in its network.&ldquo;We wish to notify the public that starting from 9.30 am today, we experienced a system outage affecting a number of core services in our network,&rdquo; CEO Bob Collymore said in a statement.&ldquo;We have identified the root cause of the outage and are working to resolve this in the shortest time possible. In the meantime, voice, data, SMS, M-Pesa and enterprise services will be available intermittently until the issue is fully resolved.&rdquo;Telecommunication companies have for the third year in a row failed to meet CA&rsquo;s Quality of Service targets. The quality of voice services offered by Safaricom, Airtel and Telkom Kenya worsened last year, the CA reported in its latest industry data.The overall performance of the three telcos was at 50 per cent, a drop from 62.5 per cent recorded in the 2014-15 financial year. The regulator requires the operators to achieve a score of 80 per cent on eight indicators, including speech quality, completed calls, call success rate and drop rate.The CA levies a fine equal to 0.1 per cent of the gross annual revenue on a telecom firm for failing to meet these standards.
