A middle aged woman has been killed by thugs in
Mlolongo town, Machakos County. Esther Mwongela was found lying unconsciously by the
roadside at Kasina Estate at 5.00am on Wednesday morning after she was
reportedly seriously beaten by thugs. Mlolongo chief David Kilonzo said it is suspected the
woman was gang raped before she was hit severally on the head using blunt
objects. Kilonzo who spoke to the Star in Mlolongo town on
Wednesday said the thugs must had been people well known to the deceased. “We suspect the thugs feared they could be exposed
by the woman after they gang raped her making them silence her completely,” said
Kilonzo. Kilonzo said Mwongela who trades in “mandazi” in the
estate was on her way home from the market where she had bought the commodity
in wholesale for re-sale. He said the deceased’s phone, mandazi and money were
recovered at the scene of incident. Kilonzo said the woman was pronounced dead on
arrival at Shalom Community Hospital. “The husband hired a vehicle and took her to Shalom Community
Hospital in Athi River where she was pronounced dead on arrival,” said Kilonzo. The body was moved to the facility’s mortuary. Kilonzo condemned the incident. He said police should pursue arrest and arraign in
court the culprits who did the heinous act.
