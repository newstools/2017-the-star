President Uhuru Kenyatta has said he was misquoted in reports that he had endorsed Nairobi governor aspirant Peter Kenneth.It was reported that the President appeared to endorse the former Gatanga MP as Jubilee flagbearer for the seat held by ODM&rsquo;s Evans Kidero.Senator Mike Sonko and former Starehe MP Margaret Wanjiru are also eyeing the seat and want to run on the JP ticket.In an address to the media at State House yesterday, Uhuru said in Kiswahili, &ldquo;Sikuwaambia wamchague. Nilisema wamuombee. Hiyo si kupigia mtu debe. (I did not tell them to vote for him. I asked them to pray for him. That does not amount to an endorsement).&rdquo;&ldquo;Muombeeni ... ubaya uko wapi? Hata naombea aspirants wote (Pray for him ... Where is the problem? I am also praying for all aspirants).&rdquo;Uhuru added that he and the Jubilee Party do not have favourites for the August 8 general election.&ldquo;I will work with the people chosen by the wananchi,&rdquo; he said.During the burial of former Gatanga MP David Murathe&rsquo;s father, Uhuru asked Murang&rsquo;a residents to pray for Peter Kenneth to ensure he wins the JP nominations today.&ldquo;I am calling on you, Kirwara residents, to pray for your son so that he can win the Jubilee ticket in Nairobi,&rdquo; he said.The President allowed Kenneth the chance to address the people.&ldquo;I will fight to get the ticket and seat in Nairobi so that when I come to visit you I will be Nairobi governor. I urge you all to vote for the President in the general election to prove your love for him,&rdquo; he said.It has been said that Kenneth will shake up Nairobi politics.Kiharu MP Irungu Kang&rsquo;ata cited his experience and achievements in and out of Parliament, which he said will be a plus for Nairobi residents.There were claims that Sonko had quit the race for Kenneth, but he dismissed them as &ldquo;social media propaganda&rdquo;.The legislator has maintained that he will be on the ballot as leaders are chosen by people.
