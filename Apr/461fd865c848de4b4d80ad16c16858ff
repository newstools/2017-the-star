Two men were nearly beaten up by angry residents for mounting Baringo Governor Benjamin Cheboi's posters at Showground centre in Kabarnet town on Saturday morning.Hostile residents demanded the removal of the posters bearing the Governor's portrait that had been mounted on electricity poles."Move this rubbish away, we don't need them here. What has Cheboi done for us? Even this you call streetlights here are not working (sic), so get out of here before we tear these papers and use them to light fire," a shopkeeper shouted.But when the men insisted on mounting them, youths pulled down the ladder they were using."Try raising that ladder again up here to put those useless papers and you will tell us whoever sent you to do that job here," a resident threatened.One of the men holds a poster of Baringo Governor Benjamin Cheboi in Kabarnet town, April 1, 2017. /JOSEPH KANGOGOFearing for their lives, the men erecting the posters left their assignment half done.Read: Quit 2017 race for my support in 2022, Governor Cheboi asks rivalsBut they went on to place posters at the nearby Kaptimbor trading centre where they were being shielded by three supporters of Governor Cheboi, who shouted down their irate opponents."Continue with your work let us see what these stupid fellows will do. Instead of waiting until election time to vote your favorite candidate, you are here putting your displeasures on lifeless posters (sic)," a supporter said.Despite the incident, a spot check by the Star revealed that a majority of posters mounted in Kabarnet town belong to Cheboi, while those of his opponent Stanley Kiptis are fewer.Last Saturday drama ensued in Eldama-Ravine town when Cheboi sneaked in Jubilee branded buses full of drunk youth to cheer him during Deputy President William Ruto's visit."Cheboi must tell us where he solicited funds to purchase more than 20 buses he is using to carry out campaigns," Kiptis said.Cheboi is expected to face Kiptis in Jubilee nominations after which the winner battles in the August 8 polls with former Kenya School of Government director Isaac Chebon, who is vying under Kanu.More on this: Cheboi shakes rivals in Baringo race, unveils 20 Jubilee branded buses
