Jubilee Party top officials have directed that voters who report to a polling station by 5 am be allowed to vote in the repeat primaries that kicked off on Monday.National Election Board chairperson Andrew Musangi on Monday said that the party was working to ensure the polls run smoothly.He said that the party had resolved cases where some voting started late in some polling centres.The nominations got off to a slow start following delays in distribution of voting materials.Some centres reported cases of aspirant's names missing on the ballot papers."A reprint of the MCAs' ballots for Kabare ward in Kirinyaga is on it's way and will be on the ground in an hour," Musangi told journalists."Issues in other areas like Embu have been resolved and we expect the process to run smoothly," he said."We are rectifying mistakes caused by human error. The process is so far promising."Secretary General Raphael Tuju said Deputy President William Ruto has helped in streamlining the nominations."We are happy and lucky that we have the DP with us. This is helping a great deal in ensuring things progress well."He also called on the party officials manning various polling stations to observe ethics and integrity."We urge our presiding and returning officers to strictly adhere to our party code of conduct," Tuju said at Pangani.A returning officer was grilled by top party officials over rigging claims in Mwea, Kirinyaga county.The official was apprehended and handed to the police after he was allegedly found with extra ballot papers.The area was tense after voting failed to kick off in some polling stations due to a shortage of ballot papers.Voters in Kirinyaga also demanded that primaries be halted as many aspirants' names were missing on the ballot.Read: Kirinyaga poll official grilled as Waiguru protests delayed pollsFormer Devolution CS Anne Waiguru asked the Jubilee Party to fly more ballot papers to the county before it was too late.Read: Tuju 'takes responsiblity' for chaotic Jubilee primaries, cancels voting in 11 counties
