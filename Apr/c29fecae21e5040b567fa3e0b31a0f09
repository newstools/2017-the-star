Kitui Deputy Governor Peninah Malonza has been rebuked for criticising Governor Julius Malombe&rsquo;s administration using vulgar language.A group of Kitui women leaders expressed disgust at Malonza&rsquo;s utterances, which they said were not only uncalled for, but disrespectful, indecent, immoral, shameful and a mockery of women.Pastor Lillian Kiteng&rsquo;e read the leaders&rsquo; statement at a Kitui hotel on Wednesday.The conference was attended by representatives from the Maendeleo Ya Wanawake Organisation, women pastors, women from saccos and self-help groups.&ldquo;We wish to express our utter shock, concern and shame occasioned by utterances attributed to Kitui Deputy Governor Peninah Malonza during a political rally organised by Kitui Senator David Musila in Mutitu Township on Monday April 3, 2017,&rdquo; the statement reads.Malonza said county government affairs and programmes are &ldquo;planned in the bedroom.&rdquo;She said Malombe &ldquo;used, dumped and sent her crashing, the same way a male baboon treats females after mating&rdquo;.The women urged Malonza to stop using abusive and dirty language to ruin ber boss&rsquo;s reputation. They said it was ill-advised and demeaning of Malonza&rsquo;s character as a woman and a leader.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s against the Akamba culture for any self-respecting woman to utter vulgarities and sexually loaded remarks in public, where men, women and children are present,&rdquo; they said.The statement said it was disrespectful of Malonza to hurl sexual insults at a senior who is old enough to be her father.The women said she had no justification to criticise the Kitui government, since she is part of the administration.&ldquo;Her criticism of the Kitui government, development projects, practices and initiatives is not only foolish and silly, but also a mark of political immaturity,&rdquo; they said.The women told Malonza to resign.In July last year, Malombe told Malonza to quit and stop rocking his administration from within.He accused Malonza of betraying him after he rescued her and made her his running mate in 2013.Malombe said Malonza is a traitor for campaigning for Musila, who has declared his interest in the governor seat.&ldquo;It is unacceptable for one to continue to rock the boat from within,&rdquo; he said.
