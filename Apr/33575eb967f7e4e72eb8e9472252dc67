ODM leader Raila Odinga has watered down the Jubilee administration&rsquo;s development achievements.He said on Tuesday that they are shrouded in inconsistencies and gross contradictions.Raila said statistics given by the ruling coalition as proof of its track record over the past four years do not add up.Raila told journalists that the hyped road infrastructure that Jubilee has been fronting as one of its reelection vehicles are nothing short of &lsquo;a huge mystery&rsquo;."In his 2016 State of the Nation address, the President said that Jubilee had built 3,000 kilometres of road. In this year&rsquo;s (2017) address, the number came down to 1,950km.""In the Budget speech read a few weeks ago, the mileage of tarmacked roads came down again to 1500km," he said."During the State Of the Nation address, the President claimed there are 7,000 km of roads under construction."According to Raila, there has been an average growth rate of 150km of tarmacked roads since Jubilee assumed power.He said KNBS data in 2014 and 2015 indicate the length of tarmacked trunk roads (class A, B,C) increased from 7,900km in 2013 to 8,200km in 2015.Raila said the Economic Survey put the number of kilometers of roads under construction in 2015 at 1,019 km."But the information contained in the just launched delivery portal puts the number at 2,000 kms of inter-city highways.""Which cities are the highways connecting? The existing cities, towns and most municipalities for that matter are already connected," Raila said."When these highways are completed, they will be only 100km shy of Mombasa to Kisumu (830) plus Namanga to Moyale (970) plus Nairobi to Mandera (800)."The opposition chief also took issue with the contradictions in the number of households the Jubilee administration claims to have connected to power.He said figures given by the president contradict those by the ministries of Energy and Treasury and the Deputy Chief of Staff Nzioki Waita."As of now, we have five wildly different numbers. The President&rsquo;s figure is 2.9 million. CS Treasury says it is 3.7 million.""The Energy CS says it is 5.5 million while Nzioki says 5.8m," he said pointing out that the figure corresponds to the number of domestic customers connected by Kenya Power.These, he said, include business premises and institutions and not just homes.Raila claimed that KPLC has in a bid to align its figures to those given by Jubilee, been inflating its figures of connected households."An internal audit was reported to have shown that about one million of the connections from the 3.6 million new customers were fake or have never been topped up," he said.He said that power outages have become rampant despite claims by the ruling coalition that power output has risen by 657MW from 1,765 MW in 2013.Raila said at best, Jubilee has managed to connect only 800,000 households to the grid over the past four years.This he said can easily be counter-checked by comparing statistics from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics report.According to the report, Raila said, the number of power connections under the rural electrification project increased by 174,690 to 703,190 up from 528,552 in 2015.On health, the former premier said the sector has turned into a home of scandal and old school theft of public funds.He cited the procurement of 99 container clinics adding that these were bought at inflated prices."The alleged misappropriation of Sh5 billion at the Ministry of Health and 'the forceful leasing of cancer diagnostic equipment for Sh5bn a year to county governments.""Health sector has been a cash cow for the big boys in Jubilee. Yet the President&rsquo;s portal sees only sterling achievement," Raila said.Of the 2.4 million titles Jubilee has claimed to have issued to Kenyans, Raila said over three million have been declared illegal by the court as they were irregularly processed.He said this was by way of the Ministry of Lands proceeding to prepare lease documents without the input of the National Land Commission contrary to the Land Registration Act.Raila said further accused Jubilee of lying about how it used the Sh196 billion Eurobond cash.The ODM leader said the questions raised on the bond will never go away as the projects it apparently funded cannot be seen.He said claims by Treasury that Eurobond proceeds had been disbursed to ministries for development projects in FY2014/15 were not practically possible."If this much money had been invested in projects, ongoing and new ones, there would not be enough days in the week for the President to launch them," Raila said.Raila said plans to remove the auditor general from office are part of the schemes by Jubilee to scuttle efforts to unravel the mystery behind the disappearance of the Eurobond."We have reason to believe that these attacks on the Auditor-General are meant to preempt the completion of the special audit on the Eurobond.""If our allegations are unfounded, why go to such great lengths to obstruct and intimidate the Auditor General? What is Jubilee afraid of?"Raila said that close to three million Kenyans are currently facing starvation yet the government allocated billions of shillings into food security projects.He said there&rsquo;s nothing to show for the Sh7.29 billion that were pumped into the Galana-Kulalu irrigation project as Kenyans continue to languish starvation."As we speak, the Jubilee administration has sent appeals for food aid all over the world."Read: I&rsquo;ve delivered on most pledges, says Uhuru, vote for me again
