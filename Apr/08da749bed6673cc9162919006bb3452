Tens of aspirants, who claimed they won ODM primaries, thronged Orange House yesterday demanding to be given their nomination certificates.They fear that unless they have the certificates in their pockets, they may be shortchanged and the documents snatched from them.Those who were at the party headquarters included several MCA aspirants from counties where the party has concluded primaries.Those present carried provisional nomination certificates issued by the election returning officers at the grassroots and demanded that the Party National Election Board hands them their certificates.However, NEB officials who are spread across the country to monitor the ongoing primaries, were not at hand to serve the aspirants who camped at Orange House for the better part of yesterday.There was drama when Wundanyi MP Thomas Mwadeghu's supporters stormed the offices demanding the ODM ticket for Taita Taveta governor race.The tens of supporters,chanting 'No Mwadeghu! No Raila', said their leader trounced governor John Mruttu during the April 18 primaries.The opposition chief whip lodged a complaint with the party's appeals tribunal on Wednesday, April 19, but said the petition is yet to be heard.This was after the elections board nullified results for some polling centres and ordered a repeat of the polls citing massive irregularities."We have come here to ensure that Mwadeghu who was duly elected is given the party ticket. Nothing more, nothing less," one of the supporters said.Mwadeghu told journalists that he "won the elections straight and square" adding he will not participate in any repeat of the process."I am here with my supporters to pick my certificate because I beat Mruttu in the primaries," he said.Mwadeghu, a senior member of the ODM party, accused the appeal panel of sitting on his petition."If they have eaten (sic) someone's money, they should say instead of taking us in circles."Some supporters engaged ODM communications director Phillip Etale in a bitter exchange of words.They accused him of being part of a cartel "sabotaging Raila Odinga's interests"."You are telling us nothing...you have no interest of the party leader at heart," a woman in the group was heard telling Etale.Etale revealed that police last night successfully thwarted a break in into a warehouse in Kisii where the party had stored ballot papers for the Homa Bay county primaries ."An attempt was made to vandalise the election materials at a warehouse in Kisii but police averted the scheme," Etale said.He said the exercise started well in most of the polling centres save for some areas which experienced delays due to logistical challenges."No incident has been reported so far, we have put in place mechanisms to ensure success," he said.
