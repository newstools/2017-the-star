President Uhuru Kenyatta has been urged to address the standoff concerning the Sh4.2 billion Lake Basin Development Authority Mall when he visits Kisumu tomorrow.Kisumu MPs said Uhuru should tell residents when the mall will be opened to create jobs for youths.Some tenants who have booked space at the mall include Tuskys supermarket. MPs Fred Outa (Nyando), James Nyikal (Seme), Opiyo Wandayi (Ugunja) and Shaurimoyo-Kaloleni MCA Prisca Misachi said delays in handing over the mall are hurting businesses.Speaking during a press conference yesterday, the MPs, led by Outa, said the delay is questionable and must be resolved immediately.They threatened to mobilise residents to protest if Uhuru fails to resolve the stalemate. &ldquo;The mall is built using taxpayers&rsquo; money and it must be put to use. We will demonstrate against the plot to auction the mall,&rdquo; Outa said.The MPs alleged there is a scheme to sell the mall to &ldquo;powerful individuals&rdquo; in Jubilee.
