Blades tackle Trailblazers in a Premier League clash at the Nyayo Stadium tomorrow.Strathmore University students, who got off their campaign to a strong start, were stopped 62-44 by reigning national champions Kenya Ports Authority over the weekend and must re-group to stop the decline. Peter Shilton must continue his shooting prowess if Blades are cut opponents. He will, however, require support from team-mates if they are to stop Alex Oguso and company ruining their day.The other top game of the day will see Griffin Ligare-led Thunder take on United States International University in what on paper looks a fairly balanced encounter. &ldquo;Tigers &ldquo; will bank on play-maker Alex Ramazani. On Sunday, former champions Ulinzi Warriors raid Lions, who were wounded 72-68 by Umoja. Veteran sharp shooter Ancette Wafula is still the top gun and remains as dangerous as ever for the soldiers. Co-operative Bank of Kenya will also parade against newly promoted Umoja. National team stars James Mwangi and Joseph Khaemba will lead the bankers against work horse Gilbert Obiero. USIU, who lost forward Kevin Kigotho to Co-op Bank still posses enough ammunition to shake off Zetech University.
