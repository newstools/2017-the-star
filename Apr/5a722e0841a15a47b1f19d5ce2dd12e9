Former world champion Benjamin Limo has endorsed veteran marathoner, Paul Tergat for the Nock presidency during the May 5 elections. Tergat, a former world marathon record holder and five time world cross country champion, is facing incumbent chairman Kipchoge Keino for the top seat. Limo said Tergat fits the position considering his profile in the world of sports.&ldquo;To strengthen Nock, we need new blood in its management,&rdquo; Limo said. He also lauded Keino for an excellent job at the helm of Nock but noted that for him to safeguard his legacy, he needs to hand over to the new generation. &ldquo;I congratulate Keino for a job well done and putting Kenya on the world map but we would like him to pass on the baton to Tergat,&rdquo; he added. Limo, however, warned Tergat to carefully choose his line up. &ldquo; Not everyone around Tergat is good and so he has to choose wisely,&rdquo; he said.
