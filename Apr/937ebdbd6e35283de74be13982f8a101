Meru Senate aspirant Geoffrey Ruku has criticised men for being selfish and disinheriting their widowed sisters-in-law and orphaned sisters. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s regrettable that quite a good number of men in the county are living in the past by harassing women whose husbands or their fathers die by disinheriting them of their family property,&rdquo; he said. Ruku spoke at Canaan Guest House and Hotel when he met women leaders who declared their support for him. He promised to advocate women's rights if elected.
