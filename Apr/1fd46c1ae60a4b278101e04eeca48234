The government has issued an alert on the outbreak of the fall army worm in Kitale, Bungoma, Kakamega, Uasin Gishu, Trans Nzioia, Busia, Nandi, Kericho, Baringo and Nakuru counties.Agriculture CS Willy Bett yesterday led a team of experts to the Rift Valley to assess the situation and sensitise farmers on preventive measures.Farmers will be sensitised on spraying weeds, which is the best way to keep the worms away.The fall army worm attacks at night, so farmers are advised to spray their plants then. During a joint press conference on the national food situation with the Treasury on Tuesday, Bett said the ministry will help save farmers&rsquo; crops because the Rift Valley is the country&rsquo;s bread basket region.&ldquo;Once we have analysed the situation, we will set up a fund to buy chemicals for farmers. The worm can completely destroy crops and this could affect our next long rain harvest,&rdquo; the CS said.On March 23, the Agriculture PS issued an alert on the outbreak of the fall army worm to all county directors.Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organisation director general Dr Eliud Kireger said infestation of the armyworm was first observed in Trans Nzoia county last month on an off-season irrigated maize crop.He said the worm occurs in large numbers and its larvae - caterpillars - cause severe damage to more than 80 plant species including maize, sorghum, rice, millet, wheat and barley. The worm also attacks fodder grasses including Bermuda grass, napier grass, sugarcane and cotton.Other susceptible crops include kales, cabbages, legumes, pulses, bananas, tomatoes, capsicum, ginger, spinach, amaranthus, onions, sugar beet, citrus, cucumber and sunflower. However, fall army worm has only been seen to attack maize in Kenya, Kireger said.He said the pest, which feeds on the leaves and whorls of the maize plant, can cause 100 per cent crop damage.&ldquo;The pest is native to Latin America and was first reported in September 2016 in the West Africa region. It has now been reported in Central, Southern and East African regions, where it is rapidly spreading causing huge crop losses,&rdquo; he said.Kireger said a lack of maize could cause food insecurity nationally and lead to the loss of income for many.This would destabilise the economy.&ldquo;This pest is of great socioeconomic importance and warrants urgent attention,&rdquo; he said.On Tuesday, the Treasury announced the price of a two-kilogramme packet of maize flour will fall from Sh140 to Sh115 in a week.Has your farm been invaded by army worms?
