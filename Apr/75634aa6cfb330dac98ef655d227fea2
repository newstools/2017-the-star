Chances of Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho being on the ballot are almost guaranteed. His supporters feared the incumbent would be barred from running because of his academic qualifications and differences with President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto. Knec launched investigations into his academic papers after it claimed he forged a KCSE result slip to pursue a degree. However, a ruling by the High Court in Mombasa makes room for Joho to defend his seat. Judge Erick Ogolla ordered the Inspector General of Police, the Director of Criminal Investigations, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Attorney General not to arrest, charge or prosecute Joho, but added they can continue with investigations against the county boss. Ogolla also ruled that no fresh probe should be launched as it would amount to malice.
