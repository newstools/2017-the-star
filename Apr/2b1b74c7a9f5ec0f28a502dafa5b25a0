Former NTSA boss and Nakuru governor aspirant Lee Kinyanjui has said he will revive pyrethrum farming if elected.He is running for the second time. Both incumbent Kinuthia Mbugua and Kinyanjui are seeking the Jubilee Party ticket.Kinyanjui said the pyrethrum sector is the backbone of Nakuru.He said when Mbugua was elected, one of the residents&rsquo; hopes was he would revive the sector. &ldquo;Our parents sold pyrethrum to educate us. If elected, my first major task will be to revive the sector,&rdquo; Kinyanjui said.Addressing residents of Turi ward in Molo constituency yesterday, he said farmers are languishing in poverty, adding Mbugua&rsquo;s administration has done nothing to help them.He said the majority of farmers in Molo and Njoro constituencies engage in potatoe farming, but the county has not built a preservation unit.Kinyanjui said Mbugua has no flagship project.&ldquo;Nakuru county receives Sh11 billion every year, but the only thing they have been able to do is build more dispensaries which are not stocked with medicine and have no staff,&rdquo; he said.Kinyanjui added, &ldquo;During the primaries and the General Election, we need to vote to change our county leadership. We cannot give Mbugua another term to do nothing.&rdquo;He said Kiambu, Machakos and Murang&rsquo;a counties receive less cash, but their administrations have been able to transform residents&rsquo; lives.Mbugua has defended himself, saying his first term was used to lay a good foundation by putting structures in place.He said the county inherited a large number of workers from the now-defunct municipal council.&ldquo;Most of our money goes to paying salaries for the county workers. We have used the remaining cash well,&rdquo; Mbugua said during his campaigns in Njoro subcounty. He cited the construction of 200 ECD classes.
