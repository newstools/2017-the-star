WITH the nominations virtually over, there are too many allegations of unfairness. And this includes in President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s backyard of Kiambu County and NASA flagbearer Raila Odinga&rsquo;s Luo Nyanza redoubt.Voters voted in large numbers in the primaries, but where is the undoubted will of the people?The ridiculous phenomenon of two candidates each wielding a winning nomination certificate was particularly grotesque &ndash; it insulted the electorate&rsquo;s intelligence, wasted their time and resources and in some cases has been upheld by party NEBs.These anomalies must be expeditiously resolved and the voters&rsquo; will respected.With the nominations over, the focus shifts to the IEBC. The parties have done their part, including ineptly and with criminal culpability. The IEBC must impose and implement all the relevant laws and regulations, including the Code of Conduct.The IEBC&rsquo;s full-time job is the conduct and management of elections.In barely 100 days chairman Wafula Chebukati&rsquo;s team must deliver a free, fair and credible General Election.
