President Uhuru Kenyatta on Tuesday directed the National Treasury to release Sh1.2 billion for Miraa farmers.He said the money will be used in the implementation of recommendations by a task force that was looking at ways of improving the crops' profitability.The President, while receiving the team's report at State House, said this will be added to the Sh1 billion set aside in the budget presented last week.The Miraa task force recommended that the state provides seed capital for farmers to access affordable credit.Uhuru said the government will facilitate the creation of farmer cooperatives to allow them access credit."This money will be used to prioritise all the recommendations of the task force within this year," he said.Uhuru said his administration will also launch a scientific study at KEMRI in collaboration with the EU.This will be with a view of developing a basis for working with the UK to lift their restrictions on the sale of Miraa.The task force also proposed the registration of miraa farmers to facilitate target intervention and eliminate the possibility of fraud.The team also called for the lifting of all restrictions on the transportation of Miraa at Kenyan airports.Currently, it is only Wilson Airport that has no restrictions on movement from the crop outside the country.Uhuru said the group that worked on the report will be transformed to an implementing committee.He directed the Head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua to discuss with the team on how they can embark on their new duties immediately.Read: Government allocates Sh1 billion to revive miraa farmingAlso read: Why does Uhuru encourage miraa growing and use?
