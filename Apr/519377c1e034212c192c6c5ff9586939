More than 20,000 children, mainly girls under 18 years, are trafficked annually in Kenya.A report released by the African Network for the Prevention and Protection Against Child Abuse and Neglect says Busia is the most prone to child and general human trafficking.The border town is a prime entry and exit point for cross-border child trafficking. Most of the girls trafficked through Busia are hired as house girls in urban towns such as Eldoret, Nakuru, Nairobi and Mombasa.It is also a source of many trafficked girls from the Luhya community.&ldquo;Many mothers and women in Nairobi want to employ a Luhya house help because it is believed they are hard working,&rdquo; ANPPCAN director of Programmes Wambui Njuguna said.&ldquo;Since the East African Community borders were broken, it became easier for perpetrators to traffic children across the countries.&rdquo;The report states that 37 per cent of children within Kenyan borders, between 11 and 16 years, affirmed that they or their siblings had been approached by perpetrators of child trafficking.Sixty per cent of those approached never shared with anyone as they did not know it was wrong to be trafficked. Among the trafficked, 80 per cent were subjected to child labour, 13 per cent to prostitution and 17 per cent were trafficked for child marriage.The report also noted a high number of child trafficking in Mandera, Marsabit and Nairobi counties.In Mandera, the main form of child trafficking is internal with the major identified route being Mandera-Wajir-Garissa-Nairobi.The most targetted in Mandera are boys who end up in slaughterhouses in Nairobi. External child trafficking happens to a lesser extent with Mandera being a transit point.&ldquo;Countries of origin include Somalia/Dolo, Ethiopia and Yemen, while the countries of destination include Southern Sudan, Libya and Europe,&rdquo; the report says.Busia, Moyale and Mandera are among the top transit routes of children within Kenya and from other countries.The National Crime Research Centre in Kenya indicates that 58.4 per cent of children trafficked go through Mandera, Wajir, Garissa, Mwingi, Nairobi and Loitoktok to Tanzania for onward transit to South Africa.This is followed by Moyale, Isiolo, Meru, Nairobi, Namanga to Tanzania at 47.8 per cent and Busia, Kakamega, Kisumu, Nairobi and Mombasa at 45.2 per cent.Nyambura Gachanja, the chairperson of the advisory committee on counter trafficking in persons, warned that perpetrators could be fined Sh30 million and/or get 30 years in prison.Rising cases of child trafficking have been blamed on poverty, illiteracy, unemployment and terrorism. There was, however, a small percentage of people who traffic for begging purposes.
