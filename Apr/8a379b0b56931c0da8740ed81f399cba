NASA is expected to officially unveil Chama Cha Mashinani leader and Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto as the fifth principal.The event to be conducted at the Bomas of Kenyas today comes after several months of the governor&rsquo;s anticipation.It is likely that the principals will talk about the flagbearer and provide a way forward ahead of the August poll.Other principals are Raila Odinga (ODM), Musalia Mudavadi (ANC), Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper) and Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula (Ford Kenya).Rutto announced the move at a meeting with teachers&rsquo; union representatives and more than 1,500 elders from Bomet and Kericho.He said he took the decision after a series of consultations with supporters.&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve held discussions and are all in agreement to join the National Super Alliance,&rdquo; Rutto said on Tuesday after the meeting at the Centre for Devolved Governance grounds in Bomet town.&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll sign a binding agreement with the coalition&rsquo;s co-principals.&rdquo;He said the elders agreed to rally behind him. The governor&rsquo;s entry is likely to change NASA plans, especially with regard to the selection of the standard bearer to square it off with President Uhuru Kenyatta on August 8.Senator James Orengo yesterday said today&rsquo;s meeting will be a platform for all the principals to clear the air on the coalition&rsquo;s flag bearer.&ldquo;There has been anxiety and confusion among Kenyans on whether the coalition is still together. This has prompted proganda reporting that has even made the matters worse,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to preempt what the meeting will entail. We can only wait and see what the principals will have to tell Kenyans.&rdquo; Orengo dismissed claims the principals failed to agree.
