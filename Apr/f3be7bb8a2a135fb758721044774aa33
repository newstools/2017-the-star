The Communications Authority of Kenya said yesterday it will carefully review the explanation by Safaricom over Monday&rsquo;s network outage before taking action. &ldquo;They already sent the first letter within 24 hours explaining that it was a technical hitch which was not deliberate,&rdquo; CA board chair Ben Gituku said in a phone interview. &ldquo;We cannot do anything until they submit a detailed report of exactly what happened.&rdquo; Safaricom fully restored all services yesterday afternoon, the giant telco said in a statement.Safaricom has waived fees for sending cash through the globally successfully M-Pesa for 24 hours from last midnight as a &ldquo;small gesture&rdquo; to customers who incurred unquantifiable losses due to the hitch. &ldquo;Although most customers could call, text and use data by noon and M-Pesa by late afternoon yesterday [Monday], this work came to an end today [yesterday] morning,&rdquo; Safaricom chief executive Bob Collymore said in the statement. &ldquo;We are now working to ensure that network stability continues.&rdquo; Gituku said that the regulator needs a detailed report from Safaricom, which the CA&rsquo;s technical team will assess to understand the root cause of the communication blackout on the firm&rsquo;s network. &ldquo;It is only then we can know the appropriate action to take,&rdquo; said Gituku. The outage experienced on Monday saw a countrywide disruption of services including calls, SMS, data and M-Pesa due to a &ldquo;technical fault&rdquo; on the network&rsquo;s main link, with the back-up infrastructure also failing.&ldquo;On Monday we had a big network outage. We had a technical fault in the network which has never happened before and not in this size or proportion,&rdquo; Safaricom director for consumer business Sylvia Mulinge said yesterday during an interview on Classic 105. This was the second major outage on the Safaricom network. There was another major hitch, though not of the same magnitude as Monday&rsquo;s, on April 2, 2014. The then Safaricom&rsquo;s corporate affairs director Nzioka Waita, now head of delivery unit at State House, had said: &ldquo;We had a technical hitch on one of our systems that resulted in a degradation of some of our services including voice, data and SMS. The degradation was characterised by delays in message delivery, call set up time and data speeds.&rdquo; The regulator has said that all telecommunication service providers should offer a 99.9 per cent delivery, adding that the CA does not tolerate downtimes of more than one hour.
