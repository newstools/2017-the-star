ODM Deputy Party leader Wycliffe Oparanya on Saturday said the ongoing party primaries are credible despite isolated cases in some parts. .He said despite the exercise witnessing 'isolated cases of malpractice and violence' as witnessed in Busia and Machakos, the process was running on smoothly.The Kakamega Governor blamed the Party&rsquo;s National Election Board of letting loopholes in the nomination process giving rise to chaos in parts of the country.Speaking on Saturday during the nomination exercise at Emabole primary school in Butere, Oparanya accused Kakamega county ODM coordinating election committee of dispatching election materials late to polling stations.&ldquo;Some boxes were open and candidates rejected them. The committee did not organise for enough vehicles to dispatch the materials to polling centers on centres. Only two vehicles were assigned per constituency and this delayed the arrival of materials to distant polling stations. Many people failed to vote due to delay in delivery of the materials and opted to attend to other issues &rdquo; said Oparanya.Oparanya said some candidates were involved in transportation of the ballot boxes and papers &ldquo;and this affected the credibility of the exercise&rdquo;He said the Party&rsquo;s national leadership had organised well for the primaries &ldquo;but it seems one person decided to do everything by himself and created problems for the party&rdquo;.&ldquo;Our democracy will only strengthen if we get it right at the party primaries. But it&rsquo;s unfortunate when a party gets it wrong at the primaries and citizens end up with wrong choice because of rigging and stuffing ballot boxes with stolen votes&rdquo; he said.Oparanya said problems witnessed in Busia, Machakos and other parts were not unique.&ldquo;They have happened in other parties and candidates need to accept and respect the decision of the tribunal&rdquo; he added.He said the ODM top leadership was committed to free and fair nomination exercise &ldquo;but a few individuals at the counties want the party to remain with tainted image of being a violent party&rdquo;&ldquo;If what we have witnessed so far is anything to go by, then we still have a long way to go to ensure democratic values take root at party levels,&rdquo; Oparanya said.Read: Chaos mark first day of ODM primaries in Bungoma, BusiaAlso read; ODM nullifies Ojaamong's ticket win, cites flaws in Busia nominations
