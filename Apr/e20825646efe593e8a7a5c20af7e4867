Dadaab MP Mohamed Dahiye ditched ODM and joined Kanu because NASA did not name a presidential candidate and the &ldquo;squabbles&rdquo; on who will be flagbearer are working to the advantage of Jubilee Party.Kanu is an affiliate of JP, while ODM is part of the National Super Alliance.This is the first time the MP has spoken on the issue since he decamped from ODM.Speaking to the Star on the phone after being presented with a direct nomination, Dahiye said, &ldquo;To date, NASA has not nominated its presidential candidate and members of key parties, among them ODM which I belonged to, ANC, Ford Kenya and others are still confused and don&rsquo;t know who among the principals will be the flagbearer.&ldquo;Unfortunately, the continued squabbles between supporters of the parties who believe their party leaders are the best to carry the flag are working to the advantage of Jubilee.&ldquo;I am not a prophet of doom but the likelihood is that NASA may lose some of their supporters who may not agree with the pick on Thursday.&rdquo;Dahiye added that he also had pressure from his supporters who have benefited from the issuance of ID cards that was not done for many years.The Jubilee administration is the first sitting government that has had dialogue with local leaders and agreed on how best to address the issue, he said.Dahiye said that among the recommendations the President took up positively and which yielded fruit is the opening of registration of persons offices in Dadaab and the striking off of the names of Kenyans whose fingerprints appear on the UNHCR database.&ldquo;We know for sure that without an ID you are virtually crippled. You can&rsquo;t move freely or do business or even further your education,&rdquo; he said.Dahiye said he does not regret leaving ODM and it is the wish of every leader for his constituents&rsquo; needs to be met.Two weeks ago, the legislator led a delegation of elders from his constituency to State House, Nairobi, where they met President Uhuru Kenyatta and pledged to support his reelection and work closely with him.Dahiye, until his recent defection, was one of the most loyal ODM members in Garissa alongside Balambala MP Abdikadir Aden.
