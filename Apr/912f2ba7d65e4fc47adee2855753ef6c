Kajiado Senator Peter Mositet resigned from Jubilee Party on Thursday and announced he will defend his seat in August.He lost in Tuesday&rsquo;s JP nominations.Mositet accused DP William Ruto of scheming to &ldquo;finish&rdquo; him politically.He said, however, his differences with Ruto will not affect his relationship with President Uhuru Kenyatta.Mositet spoke to 500 delegates from all the five subcounties in Kajiado at his residence in Kiserian.He said there is no way his opponent, Philip Mpayeei, could beat him. &ldquo;This man, who was supported by Ruto, never had a rally in any of the subcounties, except in Kajiado Central constituency. So how can someone who is not known win if there was no rigging?&rdquo; Mositet asked.In his resignation letter addressed to JP secretary general Raphael Tuju, he cited alleged manipulation of the polls.He was accompanied by Tarayia ole Kores, who lost to Joseph ole Lenku in the governor race and Gitau Parsimei, who lost to Joseph Manje in the Kajiado North MP nomination.Kores and Parsimei also quit JP.The trio promised to make a major announcement on Friday afternoon, when they meet delegates from across the county.Kores claimed the DP had on several occasions urged him to run for the Senate position, but he refused.&ldquo;I told him the senator position was intact with Mositet and there was no way I could oppose my friend. He promised to show me fire and today I have realised what he meant. He will be shocked, because all those he is supporting will not win,&rdquo; he said.
