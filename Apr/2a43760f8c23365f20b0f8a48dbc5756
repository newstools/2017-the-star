Workers at a quarry in Ol Kalou town on Monday demonstrated, accusing their representatives of pocketing Sh140,000 donated by Nyandarua woman representative Wanjiku Muhia last Wednesday.They accused group chairman Stephen Kiriga, secretary Charles Huang&rsquo;a and treasurer Kung&rsquo;u Gacheru and 10 unnamed members of sharing Sh110,000 meant for construction of a shade at the quarry and Sh30,000 for women to buy various items, including flasks.The workers (pictured) went to Muhia&rsquo;s office, but it was closed.Some praised Muhia&rsquo;s opponent Faith Gitau, while others demanded the woman representative address them and confirm whether the funds were actually sent.Worker James Mwaura said, &ldquo;It is true Wanjiku donated the money. But a few people want to take advantage.&rdquo;
