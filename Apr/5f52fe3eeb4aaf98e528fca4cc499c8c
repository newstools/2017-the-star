Two brothers from Baringo county have been sentenced to 10 years in prison by a Kabarnet court for assaulting a woman they accused of bewitching their mother.Principal magistrate Samson Temu on Friday found Josphat Chesire and Kipkorir Kiptui guilty of assaulting Sote Salina.Salina said the two went to her house, stripped her naked, forced her to urinate in a container and drink the liquid as proof she did not bewitch their mother.Temu said, &ldquo;It might be true you were in pain and angry your mother was sick, however, what you did couldn&rsquo;t not heal your mother. The woman you assaulted was the same age as your mother and did not deserve that.&rdquo;The brothers committed the crime on June 27, 2015 in Tenges, Baringo Central subcounty. They have 14 days to appeal.
