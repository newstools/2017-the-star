University of Nairobi students will today begin daily protests against the varsity&rsquo;s alleged plans to push forward the Sonu elections.The students accuse VC Peter Mbithi and dean of students Dominic Wamuguda of conspiracy to delay the polls until after the August 8 election.Aspirants Ronnie Mamba and Mike Jacobs for chairman and Jamal Birkan for secretary general spoke to the media on Friday. They said Mbithi (pictured) and Wamuguda are working with selected students to delay the union elections through amendments to the Sonu constitution. &ldquo;Why is it that the constitution of Sonu is being amended only weeks to the elections? Why is it that 90 per cent of the amendments are on Article 18 which focuses on elections?&rdquo; Mamba said. The students will take over University Way, State House Road and adjacent roads.
