Brookside Dairy, the country&rsquo;s largest milk processor, said yesterday raw milk intake has improved in the last three weeks. The company, associated with the Kenyatta family, said the improved deliveries may stabilise the rising retail prices in the coming months.A 500ml packet of processed milk currently retails at an average of Sh60 at major points of sale, while hawkers in urban centres are selling the same at Sh50. The increase in milk prices has been characterised by a dip in production resulting from challenges of the dry spell witnessed in the first quarter of the year.Brookside Dairy, which controls more than 44 per cent of the national raw milk market, said intakes had shot up by 30 per cent since the processor began paying farmers Sh42 per litre of milk delivered from mid last month.&ldquo;The growth of intakes is attributed to the improved prices we offered farmers last month. While recent rains in different parts of the country will have a further positive impact on production, we are still in a state where regeneration of forage is still going on,&rdquo; Brookside director of milk procurement John Gethi (pictured) said in a statement yesterday.Brookside said that the price incentive to farmers has attracted new suppliers, mainly dairy groups, especially in the high production sheds of Central and Rift Valley regions.
