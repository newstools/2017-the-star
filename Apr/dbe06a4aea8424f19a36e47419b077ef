Only Elgeyo Marakwet and Siaya counties have published their 2016-17 budgets, as required by law.A survey by the International Budget Partnership, which studied all 47 counties, says posting budget information at all stages is essential to allow residents to participate in budget-making and ask questions.It says most counties are reluctant to publish budget details.It did not explain whether the reasons were embarrassment over poor performance, ignorance, incompetence, bureaucracy or other issues. In 2015-16, only 11 counties filed their budget transparency reports.&ldquo;This March, counties have posted the worst-ever performance since we started conducting surveys,&rdquo; IBP project coordinator Vivian Ntinyari said.The Constitution and the 2012 Public Finance Management Act require counties to post on their websites budget information during formulation, approval, implementation, and audit stages.The survey checked the availability of primary budget implementation documents, including approved county budgets for the 2016-17 financial year. It scrutinised the 2016 County Budget Review Outlook Papers and Quarterly Budget Implementation Reports for the first quarter of 2016-17. CBROP is prepared in line with Section 118 of the Public Finance Management Act 2012 to enhance transparency and accountability in funds management.The report indicates only 11 counties posted CBROPs and only two counties published their Quarterly Budget Implementation Reports for the first quarter of 2016-17.The survey was based on eight key documents, including budget statements and audit reports.The 2010 Constitution draws a clear distinction between counties and the national government budgets.
