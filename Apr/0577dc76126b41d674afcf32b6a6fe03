Opposition chief Raila Odinga has launched a scathing attack on the Jubilee administration, accusing President Uhuru Kenyatta of &ldquo;clinging to lies to seek reelection&rdquo;.In his latest criticism of the President and Deputy President William Ruto, Raila exposed glaring loopholes in key areas, saying the government&rsquo;s &ldquo;tales&rdquo; have never added up.Raila termed &ldquo;a big mystery&rdquo; the government&rsquo;s records on the actual number of kilometres tarmacked in the last four years.&ldquo;When these highways are completed, they will be only 100km shy of Mombasa to Kisumu ( 830 ) plus Namanga to Moyale ( 970 ) plus Nairobi to Mandera ( 800 ),&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Which are the cities the highways are connecting? The existing cities, towns and most municipalities for that matter are already connected,&rdquo; Raila said.He said while in his 2016 State of the Nation address the President said Jubilee had built 3,000km of road, this year, the number came down to 1,950km. Raila further said in the Budget speech read a few weeks ago, the roads done came down again to 1,500km.He said the most recent data published by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics in the annual Economic Survey shows in 2014 and 2015, the length of tarmacked trunk roads (class A, B, C) increased by only 300km from 7,900km in 2013 to 8,200km in 2015.On electricity connectivity, Raila said the number of households connected is &ldquo;marked by the same confusion and contradictions being peddled about roads&rdquo;. &ldquo;As of now, we have five wildly different numbers. The President&rsquo;s figure is 2.9 million, CS Treasury says it is 3.7 million, the Energy CS says it is 5.5 million, and the Deputy Chief of Staff Nzioki Waita says 5.8 million,&rdquo; he said Raila said while the Kenya Power and Lighting Company&rsquo;s figure is 2.3 million, it was worth pointing out the 5.8 million figure corresponds to the total number of KPLC customers, not households (domestic) customers as claimed by Waita. &ldquo;Customers include business premises and institutions, not just homes,&rdquo; he said. On Monday, Uhuru made a case for his reelection by showcasing what his administration has achieved.
