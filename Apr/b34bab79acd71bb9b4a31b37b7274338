More than five groups have written to Treasury CS Henry Rotich protesting the proposal to lower taxes on plain cigarettes.If the proposal is implemented, prices of unfiltered cigarettes could decline by 28 per cent, making them more affordable to poor Kenyans, Consumer Information Network boss Samuel Ochieng&rsquo; said yesterday.&ldquo;This means cigarettes will become more available to children, youths and vulnerable members of our society who are already adversely affected by the economic and health effects of tobacco use,&rdquo; CIN said in a letter to the CS.Tobacco is the biggest known preventable cause of at least 13 types of cancers, which kill more than 15,000 Kenyans every year.Smokers are also more likely than nonsmokers to develop heart disease, stroke, and brain complications, the Ministry of Health has said.The government recently enacted strong legislation to discourage smoking.Reading the Budget proposals last week, Rotich suggested a two-tier tax structure of Sh2,500 for every 1,000 sticks of filtered cigarettes and Sh1,800 for every 1,000 sticks of plain cigarettes.Previously, all cigarettes were taxed equally at Sh2,500 per mille.&ldquo;This will create equity and fairness in the tobacco industry and prevent job losses in the sector,&rdquo; Rotich said.Separately, head of the International Institute for Legislative Affairs Emma Wanyonyi said the CS&rsquo;s decision could be illegal. Wanyonyi said it contravenes WHO&rsquo;s tobacco control treaty, the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which Kenya signed and ratified in 2004. The treaty bans preferential treatment for certain tobacco products.
