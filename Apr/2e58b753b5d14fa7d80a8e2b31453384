It involves everybody and ensures pregnant mothers get what they need.&rdquo;Mugambi said if breastfeeding continues, then levels of children with stunted growth will further be reduced.On exclusive breastfeeding, she said the country has increased from less than 30 per cent to 62 per cent, with the hope of reaching 80.Mugambi said wasting, which refers to low weight in relation to height, is at four per cent, but due to drought, it might worsen.
