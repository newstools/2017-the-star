Companies which will fail to remit withholding value added tax will be slapped with hefty penalties after 14 days from due date, if the taxman&rsquo;s proposals in the Finance Bill 2017 are approved. &ldquo;The Bill is proposing to introduce a due date for remittance of VAT withheld. The proposal is to have it as 14 days after withholding,&rdquo; Kenya Revenue Authority&rsquo;s Maurice Okelo said yesterday during a post-budget sensitisation. &ldquo;When we have a due date like that, we can impose penalties in order to improve compliance.&rdquo; Last year, Treasury CS Henry Rotich ordered the KRA to stop penalising firms for failing to pay accrued withholding VAT. This provision shall not be construed to impose a penalty whatsoever on any such person who ceased to withhold tax for any period following the repeal of that section up to the June 8,&rdquo; Rotich said in a legal notice on June 21, 2016. Introduction of withholding VAT under the VAT Act 2013 has increased the default rate by withholding agents, the KRA said. The agents include government institutions, parastatals, banks, financial institutions, co-operative societies, insurance companies and regular exporters withhold taxes then retain it because there is no deadline as in other taxes. This, the regulator says, has made punishing tax defaulters a difficult task due to the lack of a definite for tax remittance which has in turn hampered with the compliance of the VAT withholding provisions.&ldquo;With the deadline we will be able to increase compliance now and in the long run,&rdquo; Okelo said. Manufacturers and suppliers making zero-rated products will also benefit through a new provision that will see the commissioner halt withholding tax in the case where the nature of their business hinders them from clearing credits on time.&ldquo;This will now be addressed through powers handed to the commissioner to stop withholding tax with respect of a particular supplier who can prove that due to the nature of their business, they will not be able to clear credits in a continuous period of 24 months,&rdquo; Okelo said.
