A survey by Infotrak placing Governor Isaac Rutto ahead of his opponents in Bomet race has elicited mixed reactions from his rivals in the Jubilee Party. And while the National Assembly deputy speaker Joyce Laboso welcomed the result, his close contender, National Water Conservation chairman Julius Kones, dismissed the poll, saying it is misleading. &ldquo;We all know this will be a purely Jubilee affair and come the D-day we shall face off with our competitors and prove our worth,&rdquo; Kones said. Yesterday, Laboso said she is optimistic she will win, noting the region is a JP stronghold and not Chama Cha Mashinani party. Kones and Laboso are running on the JP ticket, and are set to face Rutto who is vying on his CCM party. In the opinion poll released on Wednesday, Rutto would get 38.9 per cent of the votes, Laboso 37.6 per cent and Kones 7.3 per cent.
