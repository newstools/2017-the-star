A Senate committee yesterday issued summonses to CSs Henry Rotich (Treasury) and Mwangi Kiunjuri (Devolution).They are expected to explain why former councillors have not yet been paid a Sh1.5 million lumpsum payment and Sh30,000 monthly stipend each. This is a year after the House adopted the recommendations.The Implementation committee, chaired by Siaya Senator James Orengo, ordered the two CSs to appear before the panel next Monday.Kiunjuri was expected to appear before the committee yesterday but cancelled, citing &ldquo;other official engagements&rdquo;.In his letter to the committee dated April 7, he said the Treasury has to okay the recommendations because of the budgetary implications.&ldquo;Within the national government, the recommendations have huge budgetary implications that would need to be considered by an interagency committee chaired by the National Treasury. In view of that, it is our considered opinion the Treasury is best placed to respond to the issues raised,&rdquo; Kiunjuri said. The Labour and Welfare committee, chaired by Kilifi Senator Stewart Madzayo, had recommended the more than 12,000 former officials of the defunct local councils deserved be paid after &ldquo;suffering for a long time without a pension&rdquo;.The House approved recommendations the former councillors be allowed access to the premises and facilities of the current county assemblies, including canteens and speaker&rsquo;s galleries.The senators also agreed with the councillors&rsquo; proposal they should be exempted from paying parking fees, other rates and fees within the areas they served. The committee, however, denied the councillors state-sponsored health insurance.
