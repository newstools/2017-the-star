Jubilee Party officials and members in Kisumu have demanded the resignation of their chairperson Atieno Otieno, who wants to unseat Governor Jack Ranguma. The looming wrangles come ahead of primaries slated for April 21. County JP deputy chairman Zuberi Liete said Otieno should step down in line with the party constitution. He said Otieno cannot run for governor while still holding the chairperson position. &ldquo;It will allow free and fair competition,&rdquo; Liete said. Speaking to the press after a heated meeting at Museum View Hotel in Kisumu, he called on party secretary general Raphael Tuju to sort the mess. Otieno declined to comment further. Nominated Senator Joy Gwendo and JP county secretary general Steve Biko urged members to stop petty wrangles and focus on making the party more vibrant.
