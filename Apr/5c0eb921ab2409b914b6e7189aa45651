A rare pre-world war II Dodge saloon car made in 1927 will be one of attractions at the CBA Africa Concours d&rsquo;Elegance at the Racecourse on September 24th. This 90-year-old car has been entered by Magdi Riad and will be the first vintage (pre-December 1930) Dodge saloon car to feature in the classiest event run by the Alfa Romeo Owners Club.The ancient car was found in a derelict state and transforming a wreck into a car in showroom condition is a major challenge. Magdi and his helpers are working against the clock to have the Dodge ready for assessment by the Concours judges. He will be up against the 1972 Austin Mini of Vitafoam products. Leslie Carvel will be driving her 1970 VW beetle from Jinja to contest the up to 1300 cc touring car class. Newcomer Christine Omuombo is placing her hopes on her 1968 Beetle. Another of these popular classic cars is the 1959 VW beetle of Stephen Warui.In contrast with the small saloons, there will be a variety of large machines to delight spectators. Among these are the 1991 three litre Mercedes Benz of Dr. Joseph Aluoch and a 1952 Chevrolet Deluxe entered by Magdi Riad, who will also have a 1978 Ford Mustang muscle car in the line-up.At this stage the majority of the motorcycles are massive street and trail bikes entered by the Uganda Bikers Association. Ibrahim Vuni, Arthur Musasizi and James Nsubuga will be mounted on BMR R1200 machines. Stephen Tabaruka, a Ugandan classic motorcycle enthusiast, will be making a second appearance at the Racecourse with his 1957 BSA. Kenyan teenager Ted Wanday is looking for a prize with a 1956 BSA which will be in the judging ring for the third time.
