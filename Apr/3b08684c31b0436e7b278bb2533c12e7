Human rights lobbyists under the Police Reforms Working Group Kenya have urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to form a commission of inquiry into rampant cases of extrajudicial killings.The group of 21 organisations said in a joint statement Uhuru&rsquo;s silence on the issue is worrying and a &lsquo;silent&rsquo; endorsement of police actions. &ldquo;You have a political responsibility and that&rsquo;s where the buck stops,&rdquo; Andrew Songa from Kenya Human Rights Commission said.The boldness and systematic manner the police are carrying out summary executions and other forms of brutality, they said, hints it is sanctioned by top security organs.This comes days after police gunned down what they called &lsquo;hardcore criminals&rsquo; in Eastleigh at the weekend - an incident that attracted mixed reactions.Nairobi county commander Japheth Koome seemed to hail the officers, putting criminals on notice and threatening that they will face the same ruthlessness.Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery is on the record many times in the past accusing NGOs and the media &ndash; who highlight extrajudicial killings and other police excesses &ndash; of being hellbent on &lsquo;soiling the good name&rsquo; of the police and slowing their work.&ldquo;A statement like this from police leadership speaks to a rank and file acceptance and perhaps, even encouragement of disregard for due process and the rule of law. It has shown the public the police leadership does indeed condone and sanction extrajudicial executions,&rdquo; the working group said in the statement. Wamaitha Kimani from International Justice Mission said an independent judicial commission of inquiry should also be set up to also investigate disappearances, torture and other ill-treatment of suspected criminals and detainees by police, military, and other law enforcement agencies.&ldquo;The commission should also examine the extent and cause of continued and persistent lack of individual and command accountability, with a view of ensuring changes in a conduct and culture, which is in line with international, regional and constitutional human rights standards,&rdquo; she said.The lobbyists also called on Uhuru to speedily assent to the National Coroners Bill 2017 to provide independent forensic investigation of questionable deaths.The statement was signed by International Commission of Jurists, the Legal Resource Foundation, the Independent Medico-Legal Unit, Fida, Amnesty International, Transparency International among other organisations, including those drawn from the grassroots.
