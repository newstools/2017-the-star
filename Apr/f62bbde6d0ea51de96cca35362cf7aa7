The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission erred by allowing NASA to run a parallel vote tallying centre, two JP politicians from the South Rift have said.Bomet Senator Wilfred Lesan and Konoin MP Sammy Koech on Friday said it was wrong to permit the alliance to run a national tallying centre, adding that this will be a recipe for chaos.The duo said having two tallying centres run concurrently but being managed by different bodies is dangerous, as it will create backbiting among political parties and unnecessary tension among voters.&ldquo;It is through such schemes that we are inviting disorder during the election period,&rdquo; Koech said.&ldquo;Since Independence, elections have been conducted by the electoral body only. Why should we allow other organs to run parallel tallying centres?&rdquo;During a meeting with the NASA principals last week, IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati said political parties and the media are free to monitor the election results for their own use, but not for broadcast.It was a sigh of relief for NASA. Chebukati warned them against declaring the results, saying the IEBC has the mandate of declaring the final results.&ldquo;Parties recognise it is the mandate of the IEBC to announce and declare the results of an election. However, political parties and media may monitor, tally and verify the results for their own internal use,&rdquo; Chebukati told a joint press briefing with the opposition.The commission had previously insisted any parallel tallying system would be illegal. This despite there being no legal prohibition.Koech told the IEBC to rethink the idea, saying, &ldquo;We should continue our tradition of having only one centre to run our elections.&rdquo;Lesan accused NASA principals of &ldquo;political posturing&rdquo; and challenged them to conduct their primaries peacefully to instil public confidence in the upcoming election.He said the plan to have a parallel tallying centre indicates NASA has panicked. Lesan criticised the IEBC for being weak and yielding to NASA&rsquo;s demands.They spoke in Koiwa, Konoin, where they presented five school buses bought with CDF cash.Lesan called for tolerance among aspirants in the region and urged residents to shun hooliganism.They commended the Jubilee Party for conducting a free and fair online recruitment of contestants, adding that this showed the party is democratic.
