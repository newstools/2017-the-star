An image of Michelle Obama wearing her hair curly while seemingly on vacation has gone viral after the internet praised the former FLOTUS for going natural.Michelle Obama is being hailed as inspirational and a role model after she was spotted wearing her normally straightened locks in a natural style, tucked into a low ponytail. The image surfaced online on Sunday and quickly went viral as Twitter users praised the mother-of-two for embracing her natural hair texture.It isn't clear where or when the photo was taken.Her hairstylist Johnny Wright said in a 2015 interview with the Root that she has been 'completely natural' for years and hinted that she would set down the straightener when she went on vacation.Indeed, the photo does seem to have been taken on one of the many vacations the Obamas have gone on after Barack Obama handed over the presidency to Trump in late January.The two jetted off with billionaire Richard Branson to his private island in the British Virgin Islands, where the former president was all smiles as he went kite surfing.It's clear after spending two terms in the White House, the husband and wife are letting their hair down - literally - as Obama was pictured wearing his baseball hat backwards and now Michelle is sporting her natural hair.Twitter users quickly made the image go viral, and the tweet had more than 20,000 retweets and 49,500 likes within a day's time.They celebrated the former FLOTUS for partaking in the natural hair movement that has been making waves within the black community for the past few years.The fight for curls aims for women of African decent or anyone who has a curlier hair texture to stop using chemical products on their hair in order to conform with society's standards of beauty and hair.Instead, it pushes for women to wear styles that protect their natural hair or to wear their curls as they naturally come. A Twitter user commented that Michelle was a 'role model to girls everywhere' and another said she had been waiting on this photo for 'like three years'. Some wish the change would have come during her time in the White House and others encouraged Mrs Obama to fully embrace her hair pattern and wear it in an Afro style.One wrote: 'Seeing Michelle Obama wear her hair natural while serving as First Lady... would've made my whole life.'Another said: 'I remember wishing with all my hear, FLOTUS would walk out with her fro out.'
