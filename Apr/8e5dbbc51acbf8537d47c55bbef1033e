Public Service PS Lilian Mbogo-Omollo and her Arts and Culture counterpart Joe Okudo met with the national leaders from the creative arts industry, led by Performance Rights Society of Kenya chairwoman Iddi Achieng. They educated them on the government's affirmative funds, such as Women Enterprise Fund (WEF), Uwezo Fund, Youth Enterprise Development Fund (YEDF) and the National Government Affirmative Action Fund (NGAAF). &ldquo;The affirmative funds are an avenue through which Kenyans can generate gainful self-employment,&rdquo; Lillian said."These funds seek to enhance the capacity of young men and women as well as persons living with disability to start and manage micro and small enterprises."
