A Thai man was arrested and
fined nearly $6,000 on Thursday at a checkpoint on the border
with Laos for suspected smuggling of semen, a customs officer
said. Nithinon Srithaniyanan, 25, was traveling with a nitrogen
tank containing six vials of what he said was human semen, said
Nimit Saeng-ampai, chief customs officer at the Nong Khai
checkpoint between northern Thailand and neighbouring Laos. "During investigation, Nithinon said he was hired to carry
semen to a clinic in Vientiane," Nimit told Reuters. "He said it came from four clinics in Bangkok and he has
done it 12 times before." The Vientiane clinic was for people with infertility, Nimit
said, but gave no further details. Nithinon, who said his client had paid him 5,000 baht ($145)
for each trip, was fined 200,000 baht ($5,817) for smuggling
forbidden goods out of the kingdom and released, Nimit said. The tank and vials have been sent for inspection to a
hospital in Thailand's northeastern city of Khon Kaen, a Nong
Khai public health officer said. If the vials' contents are confirmed to be semen, Nithinon
could face up to three years in prison for violating Thailand's
surrogacy law. Test results are expected on Monday.
