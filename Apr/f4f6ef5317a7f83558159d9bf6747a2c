The race to pocket the Jubilee Party ticket in Kiambu is in top gear, with contestants leaving nothing to chance barely two weeks to the nominations.A titanic battle is expected between Governor William Kabogo and his fiercest political would-be nemesis, Kabete MP Ferdinand Waititu popularly known as Baba Yao.Some four aspirants who had expressed their interest in the county&rsquo;s top seat include James Nyoro, Rev David Kariuki alias Gakuyo, Aquiline Njoki, and John Mugwe have dropped their bids. They are now rallying behind Waititu, whose running mate will be Nyoro.But Kabogo said he is not afraid of the Waititu-led alliance &ndash; United for Kiambu. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a seasoned and experienced politician, and I&rsquo;ll show them dust. I know how to play my cards. They will fail miserably,&rdquo; he saidKabogo launched his reelection bid on Saturday, and said he is confident he will retain the seat. His optimism has piled more pressure on Waititu&rsquo;s camp.The county boss said since his election on March 4, 2013, he has initiated many projects that have benefited Kiambu people.&ldquo;I want a second term so that we can finish all the projects we have initiated. Again, we are in partnership with many organisations, local and international, to expand the range of services to Kiambu people and bring more developments. This will be achieved when I&rsquo;m governor,&rdquo; Kabogo said. The governor said if reelected, he will create more jobs for youths. Kabogo said one of his goals is to expand the Biashara Fund, so that it benefits more residents.During a meeting in Nduberi grounds, Kiambu, last month, Baba Yao said he will create a fund that will ensure every ward gets a development kitty. &ldquo;Kiambu wants change and we are here to bring the much awaited change,&rdquo; Baba Yao said.
