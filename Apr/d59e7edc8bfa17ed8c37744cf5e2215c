The issue of extra-judicial killings is a fire subject indeed. My friends and I have been debating about it ever since we saw the video of a police officer shoot down some gangsters in Eastleigh in what many describe as a cold blooded execution. It has also probably been a divisive subject matter for you and your friends and acquaintances but make no mistake about it, it's a complex one as well. With all the hue and cry raised over the manner in which two members of the Super Power Gang were executed in Eastleigh, a counter-argument can be made by the victims pf the gang and by those who see their unrepentant comrades continue to spew threats at law enforcement on social media. Anyway, last week I was doing my homework on police relations with their communities and I came across a rather peculiar Facebook page; Kayole My Kingdom; together we can make it a safe place.   And on this page, I found a police officer by the name of Hessy whom I feel we all need to salute for his efforts to make Kayole a safe place. He has a unique way of working in that he first goes online to warn thieves to change their ways or face his wrath. This allows their friends, neighbours and family to warn them. After that, he sends them packing -to see their maker. And this is how everything goes down:  PS/ We couldn't post the graphic photos of the dead thugs.   And in the next video, the thug was dead. In less than 24 hrs, Hessy had taken care of business: And there are more examples of this:  I guess he didn't care for KeyKey's whining and complaining. hapa kazi tu!  And it goes on and on like some horrible song:   Check out how the residents respond to these posts: But this is the comment that takes the cake:
