Construction of an oil jetty on Lake Victoria is set to start in two days, the Ministry of Energy said yesterday, adding that the tendering process is complete.The Sh1.5 billion project will facilitate increased trade in petroleum products with neighbouring countries through Kisumu. Energy CS Charles Keter said the construction will take six months. Kenya Pipeline Company floated an international tender for construction of the facility on January 18.The jetty will increase KPC&rsquo;s competitive edge in the region as the leading oil transporter, Keter said. It will also expand the export market into Uganda and mines in northern Tanzania by creating an integrated marine fuel transportation system in the region. This will make it more efficient and commercially viable and reduce transportation costs for the oil marketing companies, the CS added.Speaking in Kisumu yesterday during the official launch of the KPC promotional tariff in Kisumu, he said they will ensure that the project is completed within the specified period.&ldquo;The government is committed to ensuring smooth and quick delivery of oil and other petroleum products and the construction of this jetty is a confirmation,&rdquo; Keter said.The CS also put on alert those engaged in fuel adulteration saying their days are numbered.Keter said they have intelligent report of some cases of adulterated fuel in Kisumu, Eldoret and Nakuru and will soon catch up with the suspects.&ldquo;They should know that there days are numbered and onces arrested, they will be heavily charged,&rdquo; he said.
