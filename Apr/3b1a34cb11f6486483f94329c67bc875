A Rwandan man accused of
leading and coordinating attacks on minority Tutsis during
Rwanda's 1994 genocide has been sentenced to life imprisonment
for his role in the mass slaughter, Rwanda's high court said on
Thursday. In the genocide, an estimated 800,000 ethnic Tutsis and
moderate Hutus were killed in just 100 days. Bernard Munyagishari, who headed a government-allied militia
known as the Interahamwe in Rwanda's west, was convicted of
crimes of genocide and crimes against humanity. Lawyers for Munyagishari said they would appeal. Timothée Kanyegeri, one of the three judges who convicted
him, said Munyagishari had trained the militia in how to
distinguish the Hutu from Tutsis. He also "told them that to
kill as (for a) snake, you have to hit hard the head, otherwise
it will sneak away", the judge said. Kanyegeri said Munyagishari had transported members of the
militia in buses as they went to kill the Tutsis in Rwanda's
former district of Gisenyi and had personally helped to
distribute guns, machetes, axes and clubs used in the killings. Munyagishari was arrested in neighbouring Democratic
Republic of Congo in 2011. His case was transferred to Rwanda in
2013 from Arusha, Tanzania, where the now-closed International
Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda was based. Munyagishari is being held in Kigali's central prison and
was absent during Thursday's sentencing.
