A section of Jubilee MPs from Kisii county yesterday said it will deliver victory to President Uhuru Kenyatta.They are Kisii Senator Chris Obure and MPs Jimmy Angwenyi (Kitutu Chache North), Richard Tong&rsquo;i (Nyaribari Chache), Elijah Moindi (Nyaribari Masaba), Simon Ogari (Bomachoge Chache) and Stephen Manoti (Bobasi).They have promised to get at least 60 per cent of the voters to back Uhuru. The region is perceived to be an opposition stronghold. In 2013, ODM leader Raila Odinga garnered a massive 68.8 per cent of the total votes cast, against Uhuru&rsquo;s 27.8 per cent. Speaking separately to the Star on the phone, the politicians said they will turn the tables on Raila. Obure dismissed NASA as a &lsquo;feeble and impotent&rsquo; outfit incapable of winning. &ldquo;These NASA people have nothing to offer the Omogusii community,&rdquo; he said.
