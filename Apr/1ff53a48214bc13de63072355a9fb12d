Kenya is going into its 12th General Election, and the sixth since the restoration of political pluralism, with only two strong political formations &ndash; the ruling Jubilee Party and the opposition National Super Alliance.These are not exactly two parties in the meaning of the phrase in the mature democracies of the US and UK.But it beats the fragmentation of 2013 and before. What&rsquo;s more, a strong party in government with a countervailing strong opposition can only be good for Kenya.All signs are that there will be more independent candidates than ever before, a good thing considering that it offers more options and creates room for issues-based competitiveness.It is important that the August 8 election should be the most peaceful and least fear-based, in the 100-day run-up, during and after the polling and results.A dozen elections since Independence 54 years ago should find Kenyans democratically mature enough to make choosing our leaders a dignified and decisive experience.That way our democracy can only be strengthened and begin to become a way of life.
