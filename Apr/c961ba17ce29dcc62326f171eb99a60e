The government must arrest, investigate and prosecute culprits,&rdquo; Awiti said.He urged county commanders to take charge so voters are not deterred from participating in the electoral process.&ldquo;Let no blood be shed, no life lost and no property destroyed,&rdquo; Awiti said.He said violence creates investor apathy and accused Jubilee, Wiper and ODM elections boards of conducting shambolic nominations and creating room for chaos.
