Ever heard of someone keeping a chicken for a pet?Kenyans, especially those living in urban centres, are known for their obsessive appetite for chicken.Currently, poultry farming is one of the most lucrative businesses in the country because of the market availability. In every corner of the town, you will not miss a fast-food restaurant serving chicken and chips (fries).All major hotels in towns serve chicken as one of their best meals.However, one Kenyan in Mombasa county has decided to venture into the poultry business in a very different way, rearing exotic chicken breeds kept as pets and the pure African breeds (kienyeji) chicken for consumption.Many chicken farmers in the country, especially those living in urban centres, rear the hybrid chicken &mdash; broilers and layers &mdash; because they take very few weeks to grow into maturity and lay many eggs.A pure breed chicken takes at least six months to grow into maturity and lays only one egg per day, whereas the hybrid takes three weeks to mature and lays several eggs, depending on the feeds.Started with quails Sam Ikwaye, the Coast Executive director of the Kenya Association of Hotelkeepers and Caterers, started the Vintage Poultry Farm in 2014 in Kashani, Kisauni constituency, initially keeping quails.&ldquo;There was a time the quails business was doing very well, but after some months, the business went down after negative publicity. I did not give up, I decided to add the kienyeji chickens into my farm,&rdquo; he says.However, last year, Ikwaye decided to try to rear the exotic breeds of chicken, which are kept as pets in the UK, US and other foreign nations.Keeping chicken as a pet became increasingly popular at the turn of the millennium among the urban and suburban residents.In Ikwaye&rsquo;s farm, there are now 10 different types of exotic chicken, whose prices vary from Sh2,500 to Sh75,000 per pair.&ldquo;You mean, two chickens &mdash; male and female &mdash; sell at a whopping Sh75,000?&rdquo; I ask.&ldquo;Yes, these are not just the normal chicken meant for consumption or laying eggs. These are kept as pets, like dogs and cats,&rdquo; Ikwaye says.Ikwaye keeps Brahmas, Silkies, Polish, Belgian broodies, Seramas, Cochins, Leghorns, Pheasants and other breeds. In his farm, there are also quails and guinea fowls.To keep quails, guinea fowls and Pheasants, you need a licence from the Kenya Wildlife Service, Ikwaye says as we go through his Sh3 million farm.&ldquo;A pair of Pheasant is the one going for Sh75,000,&rdquo; he says.Pheasant is a well-known game bird in the US and the UK. It is among the world&rsquo;s most-hunted birds and has been introduced for that purpose in many regions.Many people have now opted to keep this bird as pet in their homes.Fluff balls Ikwaye says Cochins are known the world over for being big, friendly balls of fluff and feathers.Despite the fact that they do not lay eggs well, they are popular because of their sweet personality, and thus a good breed to be kept as pets.Polish is a European breed of chicken known for its crest of feathers, Ikwaye says.In addition to combs, they are adorned with large crests that nearly cover the entirety of the head. This crest limits their vision, and as a result can affect their temperament.Polish chickens are bred primarily as a show bird, but were originally productive egg layers.Ikwaye says the Leghorn is a breed of chicken originating from Tuscany in Italy.According to history, Leghorn was first exported to North America in 1828 from the port city Livorno on the western coast of Tuscany. The breed was introduced to Britain from the US in 1870.Breeds such as Silkies and Bantams are generally docile, making them ideal pets for home owners, Ikwaye says, adding that they are not aggressive like other breeds of chicken that make a lot of noise.Silkie is a breed of chicken named for its typically fluffy plumage, which is said to feel like silk or satin.The breed has several other unusual qualities, such as black skin and bones, blue earlobes, and five toes on each foot, whereas most chickens only have four.&ldquo;They are often exhibited in poultry shows, and appear in various colours,&rdquo; Ikwaye says.Brahma is large breed of chicken developed in the US from very large birds imported from China. It was the principal meat breed in the US from the 1850s to 1930s.Belgian broody is one of the sweetest, loveliest and cuddliest pets in the whole wide world.This breed originates from Belgium and comes in many different shapes, colours and sizes.Serama originates from Kelantan in Malaysia and was first exhibited in 1990.The breed was hit hard by the Asian bird flu epidemic in 2004, when many birds were culled amid government concerns.Pet licence In many countries, to keep a chicken as a pet, you have to get a licence from the government.In the US, some states allow chicken to be kept as pets, but some states have banned the practice.In Hong Kong, keeping chicken and other poultry without a licence has been banned since 2006 because of the threat of avian flu.Ikwaye said he has already acquired a KWS certificate that enables him to keep the Pheasant, quails and the guinea fowls, which are considered as wild creatures.His farm on a quarter an acre has about 400 chickens, both kienyeji and the exotics ones that are kept as pets.Currently he is mainly selling the kienyeji breeds, as he increases the stock of the exotic pet breeds.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking forward to expanding this business,&rdquo; he says.He says they have a network in which they collect and exchange different breeds for rearing and selling as pets locally and for export.For the kienyeji chicken, a full-grown hen sells at between Sh1,000 to Sh2,500, depending on the size.An egg laid by the kienyeji chicken goes for about Sh30 and a tray goes for Sh1,500.
