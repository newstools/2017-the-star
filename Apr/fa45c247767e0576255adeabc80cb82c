Tatu City has launched the third phase of its ‘Buy and Build’ residential project at Kijani Ridge, Kiambu. On Saturday, Tatu introduced an additional 100 quarter-acre plots after exhausting the previous existing parcels. Speaking during the Kijani Ridge Fourth Open Day, Nick Langford, the Tatu City developer, said the demand for serviced plots continues to rise as earlier phases have been sold out. “We’ve seen a tremendous increase in the uptake at Kijani Ridge as a result of a better realisation and appreciation of the Tatu City concept and value. Kijani will offer amenities such as a clubhouse, restaurant, school, mini-shopping centre, jogging track, dam and natural green open space. This is a worthwhile investment for any family,” he said. Langford said they have products for different categories of investors, ranging from Sh2-50 million. He said this will decentralise the urban environment.
