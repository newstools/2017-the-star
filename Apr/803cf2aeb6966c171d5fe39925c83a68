Mwingi residents want the IEBC to bar from running any politician who causes chaos during today&rsquo;s Wiper nominations.They said the Jubilee and ODM nominations were shameful. Resident See Nzomo said they expect well-organised primaries.&ldquo;I know Kalonzo Musyoka as a peacemaker. Those contesting should not shame him. We want everything to go as planned,&rdquo; he said.Nzomo urged losers to support the winners or lodge complaints with the right people, instead of inciting heir supporters to violence.&ldquo;They should not fight or cause their supporters to fight over nothing as witnessed in parts of Western, Rift Valley and Central,&rdquo; he said.Nzomo said there is life after nominations and no one should shed blood as the process is not a matter of life and death.&ldquo;Life will continue as usual,&rdquo; he said.Resident Mutune Kioko accused politicians of using the youths to fight their wars.He said some contestants have invested heavily in campaigns and want to be elected at any cost so they can recover their cash.&ldquo;If they fail, they think that&rsquo;s the end of life. So they do all they can to be nominated,&rdquo; Kioko said, urging residents to reject such leaders as they are the source of their problems.
