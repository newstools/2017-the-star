ODM deputy party leader and Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya has urged voters in Western to support whomever is picked NASA presidential flagbearer.He hit the ground running on Tuesday campaigning for ODM, a day after he was issued a direct nomination certificate.ODM once said it would not issue direct tickets.However, issuing direct ticks is a strategy to appease governors and motivate them to handletiff competition among NASA anchor parties.ODM&rsquo;s decision to dish out direct nominations curtailed any possibility of joint nominations to prevent unhealthy internal competition that could split the opposition and hand Jubilee victory.NASA co-principals Raila Odinga (ODM), Masalia Mudavadi (ANC) Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper) and Ford Kenya&rsquo;s Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula are set for a retreat staring on Friday to discusss who will fly the opposition flag.On Saturday, Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale said the team had chosen to first share the government positions before naming the torch bearer. He is a member of the NASA National Coordinating Committee.Speaking in Malava subcounty on Tuesday, Oparanya said NASA will only field a presidential candidate but affiliate parties will compete for other elective seats in what he termed &ldquo;friendly fire&rdquo;.Oparanya said those saying they will not support NASA if the candidate is not one of their own could be working for Jubilee.&ldquo;NASA is a people&rsquo;s movement whose main objective is to rescue Kenyans from the misrule by Jubilee. It is not about individuals,&rdquo; he said.Oparanya criticised Jubilee for &ldquo;selectively&rdquo; rolling out street lighting in the region.He said the national government only commissioned street lighting in constituencies represented by Jubilee MPs.&ldquo;Street lighting is a devolved function and I wonder who will be paying the bills since I know the programme is only meant to lure locals to vote for Jubilee,&rdquo; Oparanya said.More than 5,000 aspirants will take part in the ODM primaries which kick off tomorrow.ODM chairman John Mbadi said the party will conduct the nominations and give tickets to successful candidates who meet the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission timelines.Speaking on the phone on Tuesday, he said the process will be peaceful, free and fair.&ldquo;Every aspirant signed the code of conduct,&rdquo; Mbadi said.He said ODM followers will weed out people planted in the party, believed to be Jubilee sympathisers.National Assembly minority leader Francis Nyenze hit out at the Orange party, saying Raila&rsquo;s outfit wants to suffocate other partners by handing out direct tickets.&ldquo;ODM has set a very bad precedent because there are aspirants from partner parties who are contesting against those governors,&rdquo; he told the Star in a phone interview.Nyenze, the Kitui West MP, said some ODM members resort to blackmailing other partners to silence them from questioning &ldquo;dictatorial tendencies&rdquo;.&ldquo;When we point out some glaring issues, they call people like me a tribalist, but when they do it, they are high priests,&rdquo; he said.Nyenze said ODM&rsquo;s &ldquo;selfish interests&rdquo; will kill the NASA spirit. He said Wiper will oppose any further move by ODM to issue direct nominations to regions considered battle grounds without consultation.Raila on Monday issued direct tickets to 400 unopposed aspirants, among them seven governors and aspirants for parliamentary seats. In ODM strongholds, MP aspirants have one foot in Parliament.
