The High Court has ruled that a case in which the members of a microfinance group want the CBK to return their Sh2 billion and other assets has merit.More than 10,000 members of the dissolved Kenya Akiba Microfinancing Limited had asked the Chief Justice to order the Central Bank of Kenya to return the assets confiscated during its closure.CBK wanted the case dismissed but trial judge Francis Tuiyot yesterday said the case must go to full hearing.The judge said although it was during vacation, he is ready to hear the case on April 6 so that the creditors are compensated.Imenti Central MP Gideon Mwiti is one of the petitioners.They say CBK has delayed compensating them as ordered by High Court judge Alfred Mabeya on May 4, 2012.Akiba Microfinance, owned by Mwiti, was invaded by officers from the CBK, the Banking Fraud Investigation Unit and police in November 2005. The officers took away computers, title deeds and logbooks.The firm was accused of irregularly carrying out banking services.
