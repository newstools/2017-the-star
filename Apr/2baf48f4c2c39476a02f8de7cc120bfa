Meru Governor Munya yesterday denied claims he spent Sh100 million to supply water to his farms. Senator Kiraitu Murungi made the claim on Monday. &ldquo;He has taken me to court before [but] I will not shun from saying [it]. Let him take me there once more. Munya has used Sh100 million to connect his shambas with water,&rdquo; he said.Kiraitu spoke at his home in Nkubu during a youth&rsquo;s forum.But Munya asked Kiraitu to produce documentary evidence.&ldquo;No coin have I used to instal water in any of my private lands. He should come out clearly and show the public the records and documents indicating the money and shamba connected," he said.&ldquo;Let him present the same to EACC and other government [agencies] that deal with public funds misappropriations to take action against me.&rdquo; Kiraitu is eyeing Munya's seat. He has on many occasions accused Munya&rsquo;s administration of not implementing development projects.Kiraitu said construction/rehabilitation of Kinoru stadium has stalled, even though Sh200 million had already been spent on it. He also cited a county hotel that has gobbled up Sh180 million with no tangible progress.&ldquo;His main problem is not only aging but also his poor workmanship track record, in the 35 years in power as MP and senator. Ten years he was the strongest minister in Kibakis government. It is only Chris Murungaru who had the same powers like Kiraitu. What did he do for the benefit of [the] larger Meru,&rdquo; he saidHe said there is no dream Kiraitu could not have fulfilled during those years in power, adding that it is time he gave way to the next generation.
