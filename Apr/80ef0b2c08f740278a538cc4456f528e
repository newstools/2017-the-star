Coast regional coordinator Nelson Marwa should keep off politics, Wiper secretary general Hassan Omar yesterday said.Omar is also the Mombasa senator. He has declared his interest in the governor position.&ldquo;Please, regional coordinator Marwa, keep off politics because you are giving politicians in this county who do not deserve leadership, sympathy that can rope them to victory,&rdquo; said Omar during a press conference at the Renaissance Centre.He was responding to a briefing of Marwa&rsquo;s, where he mentioned several politicians, among them Jomvu MP Badi Twalib and Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho&rsquo;s cousin Said &lsquo;Saido&rsquo; Abdhalla.Marwa said Twalib and Abdhalla use youths to cause chaos. Abdhalla is vying for the Nyali parliamentary seat on the ODM ticket. Former KTN journalist Mohammed Ali said he rigged the ODM nomination last Saturday.Marwa said Abdhalla is intoxicating youths with alcohol and uses them to intimidate his rivals.&ldquo;Who is this guy Saido? Is he above the law? He walks around with 400 goons and police are just clapping their hands for him,&rdquo; Marwa said.Abdhalla is away in Nairobi after he was summoned by the ODM National Elections Board over the Nyali nomination rigging claims. He says his record is clean. &ldquo;There is nothing like that. My record is clear. Those are his stories,&rdquo; Abdhalla said.Omar said Joho will defend his cousin and in the process look for sympathy votes from Mombasa residents, who are tired of his poor leadership. &ldquo;Tomorrow Saido will be called to the police station, Joho, who has been quiet for almost a month, will come out to defend him and before you realise it he will be diverting the agenda again,&rdquo; he said.
