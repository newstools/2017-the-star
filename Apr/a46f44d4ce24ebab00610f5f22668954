Police officers charged with the murder of lawyer Willie Kimani and two others want LSK, IJM, and lawyers representing victims blocked from cross-examining witnesses.The five are accused of hatching a plot to mercilessly kill Kimani, his client Josephat Mwenda and driver Joseph Muiruri on June 23, 2016.But they filed an application before trial Judge Jesse Lessit on Monday saying their rights to a fair trial is being violated.The five include Fredrick Leliman, Leonard Maina, Stephen Chebulet, Silvia Wanjiku and informer Peter Ngugi.They said there is no provision in the law that allows cross-examination by other lawyers apart from the DPP."In criminal proceedings, advocates watching brief have no capacity to cross-examine witnesses at all," their lawyer James Muchere said in court papers.The new legal challenge comes after shocking revelations, linking yet another police officer to the killer suspects, was introduced during cross-examination a fortnight ago.Lawyers watching brief for the family, Law Society of Kenya and International Justice Mission, relied on Facebook chats and phone data records.This was to prove Wilson Kamau, an officer attached to an undercover unit that was headed by Leliman, called Ngugi several times from June 23.Kamau had denied knowing Ngugi and when he was referred to the evidence, he asked to be heard in camera."Allowing advocates watching brief to cross-examine witnesses is prejudicial and is not backed by any provisions of the law nor the constitution," lawyer Cliff Ombeta said.The lawyers said a pretrial conference was held at the beginning of the proceedings when Justice Lessit took over the hearing from Justice Ruth Sitati.They said that parties agreed that IJM, LSK victim&rsquo;s lawyers will make contributions in the trial through the DPP.According to the defence, some of the issues raised in cross-examination by advocates watching brief for and on behalf of victims has introduced new facts they are unable to respond.The lawyers watching brief have cross-examined at least four witnesses.The DPP and the lawyers have asked for more time to respond to the application.Parties will go back to court on Wednesday, April 26 for hearing.Read: Witness in Willie Kimani murder case describes lawyer's struggle for helpAlso read: Three officers, strange cars spotted in field where Willie Kimani may have been killedMore on this: Tears flow as family of slain lawyer Willie Kimani testifies
