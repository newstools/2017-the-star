Two Ukambani leaders have said it is unfair for some leaders to criticise National Assembly minority leader Francis Nyenze for demanding that Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka be named NASA flagbearer.The coordinator of Mwingi Region Professionals, Campbell Munyambu, and Athi MCA Peter Kilonzo said Nyenze deserved accolades and not bashing, as he had articulated the voice of the Kamba community.&ldquo;No one is justified to criticise Hon Nyenze for making public the stand of the people of Ukambani. It is true that we are waiting for Musyoka to be named the NASA flagbearer, not Raila Odinga,&rdquo; Munyambu said on the phone yesterday.And speaking on Friday when he accompanied Kitui Governor Julius Malombe to launch the twin Nguuni bridge, Kilonzo said those criticising Nyenze are cowards. He said all Kambas want Kalonzo to be the NASA flagbearer.Munyambu added that Cord leader Raila Odinga should make himself a kingmaker by honouring the agreement he signed with Musyoka to back the Wiper leader.&ldquo;The truth must be told that if Kalonzo is not made the flagbearer, there will be no NASA,&rdquo; he said.On Thursday, a day after Nyenze said Kalonzo should be NASA flagbearer or Wiper quits the alliance, some Ukambani leaders criticised him for the comments.
