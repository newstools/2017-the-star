A 50-year-old man committed suicide in Naivasha after his preferred aspirant lost in the just concluded Jubilee primaries.Residents found the man hanging from the ceiling of his bedroom on Sunday.The deceased is said to have been a chief agent to a woman representative aspirant and was confident she would perform well during nominations."Some people claim that he committed suicide after learning his candidate had lost, while other claim that he had been depressed for some months," Joshua Wambugu, a resident, said.In another incident, an elderly man was gored to death by a buffalo in Eburru area, Gilgil constituency.The father of five was cutting grass near Eburru forest when the lone buffalo attacked and killed him."We have lost a few people in this area due to wildlife attacks and despite out cries to KWS, nothing has been done," said James Kimani, a resident.A senior KWS officer who declined to be named said there has been an increase in cases of wildlife straying into farms and estates in Gigil and Naivasha."The current drought has taken its toll on the animals pushing them from their haven to nearby farms in search of pastures and water," said the officer.
