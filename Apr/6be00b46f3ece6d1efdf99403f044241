They were armed with rungus. &ldquo;I thought they wanted money, but within a minute, I heard a loud bang at the back of the vehicle and I found they had already smashed the window. They didn&rsquo;t steal anything. It seems it was meant to intimidate me,&rdquo; Githaiga said. Nobody was hurt. She has recorded a statement at Mweiga police station.
