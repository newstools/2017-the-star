I can now fuel a chopper to fly me while campaigning, thanks to my staff and friends, Baringo Governor Benjamin Cheboi has said.The governor (pictured), who is defending his seat, has rubbished claims by his opponent Stanley Kiptis that he is using public resources to fund his reelection.&ldquo;I doubt Cheboi&rsquo;s monthly salary for just four years is enough to fund his campaigns. The anti-corruption commission must do something immediately,&rdquo; Kiptis said. But Cheboi denied misappropriating county funds.The governor was addressing friends and staff at Lake Bogoria Spa Hotel in Baringo county on Tuesday during a fundraiser, where Sh10.5million was raised. His wife Dr Emmy Chesire, Bishop Jackson Kosgei and Deputy Governor Mathew Tutoek among others attended the function.
