A new Migori governor aspirant has joined the race to unseat Okoth Obado, only four months to the general election.On Friday, Jack Okoth launched his campaign at Bware Primary School, Uriri. He will run on the ANC ticket. Okoth attended a county tour of party leader and Nasa co-principal Musalia Mudavadi.&ldquo;The person standing before you is the sure bet to send Obado home. I waited until today in the presence of my party leader and presidential candidate to launch my campaigns across the county,&rdquo; Okoth said. He said he has been brought up in hardship, which will make him empathise with residents in the distribution of resources. Okoth said he will formulate policies that will ensure residents appreciate devolution. Mudavadi urged his supporters, especially from the Luhya community, to vote as a bloc for ANC candidates.
