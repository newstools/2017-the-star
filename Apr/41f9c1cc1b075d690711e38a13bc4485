Narok Governor Samuel Tunai has described Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto&rsquo;s Chama Cha Mashinani as a cynical plot by opposition chief Raila Odinga to get the Kipsigis vote through the backdoor. Tunai reminded residents the Kipsigis voted for Raila to a man in 2017 polls, when William Ruto was Raila&rsquo;s deputy. But Raila abandoned the community when the Mau Forest controversy erupted, and left the DP to fight ICC charges on his own, Tunai said.The governor was speaking on Wednesday when Narok West MP aspirant Paul Chesimet launched his campaign at Rongena. Deputy Governor Aruasa and woman representative Soipan Kudate attended. Tunai cautioned the Kipsigis against falling for Raila&rsquo;s tricks. &ldquo;Rutto should spend his energy in Bomet, not Narok because Narok is a Jubilee zone. If he does not know the boundary of Bomet and Narok counties, I am volunteering to show him,&rdquo; Chesimet said. Speaking in Naikarra in Narok West constituency, Rutto told Tunai to concentrate on Jubilee matters and leave CCM issues to him.
