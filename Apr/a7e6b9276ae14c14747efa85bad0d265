Pokot leaders yesterday condemned the Baringo security operation to flush out bandits, saying innocent people are the victims. West Pokot Senator John Lonyangapuo, CAA chairman Samuel Poghisio and Baringo speaker William Kamket accused security forces of using excessive force, torturing innocent citizens, shooting livestock and burning houses.They want the government to resolve the banditry problem in a sober manner so residents can go on with their daily lives without disruptions.Failing that, residents may not participate at the August poll, they said. They proposed dialogue among warring communities.&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t bring about peace in such a manner. Pokots are Kenyans and don&rsquo;t deserve such humiliation,&rdquo; Lonyangapuo said.The leaders spoke in Orolwa, West Pokot, where they urged human rights organisations and the Kenya Red Cross to come to residents&rsquo; rescue. Lonyangapuo urged leaders to unite and find a lasting solution to insecurity.&ldquo;Cattle rustling cannot be stopped by forcible disarmament. What we have seen through the media is not pleasing. Why shoot animals? This exposes residents to poverty,&rdquo; he said.Kamket accused security forces deployed in the region of stealing animals and ferrying them to unknown destinations. &ldquo;Police should not steal people&rsquo;s animals,&rdquo; he said, adding that Nasorot and Kostei residents have fled from their homes for fear of police brutality. Poghisio termed the operation inhumane.
