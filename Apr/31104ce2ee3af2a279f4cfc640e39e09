National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi says Senator Lenny Kivuti lied to the President that he would support Runyenjes MP Cecily Mbarire for governor.Muturi on Sunday openly campaigned for President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s reelection and for Mbarire. He attended a rally at Kanyuambora town, where he comes from. It&rsquo;s Kivuti&rsquo;s backyard.Present were Mbarire, Mbeere North MP Charles Njagagua, Embu speaker Justus Mate, Embu Senate aspirants Geoffrey Ruku, Alexander Mundigi and woman representative hopefuls Monicah Syombua, Wawira Njue and Jane Wanjuki.Muturi said Kivuti led Embu leaders to his office in Parliament in 2015 and told him they had agreed to support Mbarire.Muturi said Kivuti was accompanied by Mbarire, Njagagua and Mate. He said the leaders told him they had met on several occasions to put an end to the political bickering that undermined development.Muturi said they swore before him that they would support Mbarire for the seat and asked him to take the message to the President.He said even before he could deliver the message, Kivuti himself met the President and informed him about the agreement.Muturi said the senator also wanted support for a senior office in future.He wondered why Kivuti backtracked on the agreement &ldquo;which he was not forced into&rdquo;.Muturi described Kivuti as a &ldquo;blatant liar, selfish and greedy for power and a very unreliable and untrustworthy person who deserves not to be elected as the governor&rdquo;.He said Kivuti should retract all the promises he has made to the people. &ldquo;It was wrong for an adult to commit himself openly about something he had not been pressured to do and later lie to the President,&rdquo; Muturi said.
