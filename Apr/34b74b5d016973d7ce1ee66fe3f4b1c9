Senator Mike Sonko was yesterday evening maintaining a steady lead in the race for the Nairobi governor in the Jubilee nominations.The flamboyant senator had garnered 68,208 votes against his closest challenger Peter Kenneth&rsquo;s 28, 861 in nine of the 17 constituencies in the city.Former Starehe MP Margaret Wanjiru was a distant third with 5,282 votes.The results were from Kibra, Embakasi East, Langa&rsquo;ta, Dagoretti North and South, Mathare, Embakasi South and North and Roysambu . Returning officer John Rotich announced the results at Nyayo Stadium, the county talling centre.But even before the results were announced, Kenneth had rejected them, saying the process was not free and fair.&ldquo;I dissociate myself from the sham election the Jubilee Party purported to have and demand the same elections be nullified,&rdquo; he said in a statement.During voting on Wednesday, both Kenneth and Sonko raised concerns about the way the exercise was being conducted. Kenneth said the exercise had hiccups and was full of irregularities. He said it &ldquo;was free for all&rdquo; and that people from outside Nairobi were imported to vote for some candidates. Sonko, on the other hand, said most of his supporters were blocked from voting after their names were found from the register.In the JP Senate race, nominated MP Johnson Sakaja led the pack. He had garnered 55,562 votes from the nine constituencies.Sakaja was followed by Kavemba Mutimba, who had 5,174, William Wahome had 2,187, Muchiri Muthmao 2,183 and Badi Ali who had garnered 2,943 votes.Sakaja, who initially wanted to run for governor, made an about turn.
