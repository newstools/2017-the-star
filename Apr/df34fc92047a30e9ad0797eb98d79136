Bishop Allan Kiuna and Rev Kathy Kiuna have always let their children live their life to the fullest.Their youngest son, Jeremy Kiuna, was born with cerebral palsy, a permanent movement disorder that appears in early childhood. He was born six months premature, but he still fought so much as a young boy.Years down the line, he&rsquo;s all grown up and still grateful for how far he has come.Jeremy is a quiet child and he rarely speaks about his condition, but he took this opportunity to share with the world details of his surgery and what he&rsquo;s most grateful for.&ldquo;Going through what I&rsquo;ve been through in my life isn&rsquo;t the best. Some days I mess up, some days I do the best I can. June 1, 2016, was my first surgery ever in my entire life. It was crazy because I needed the surgery to be able to walk and I finally got the opportunity God gave me and I&rsquo;m happy,&rdquo; Jeremy revealed.He continued: &ldquo;So people, this is from my heart. Please spread love to anyone and everyone. I want all my followers, friends and family to do this. Some people really need love. My life is not the best but with love anything is possible.&rdquo;His mother was so proud of him as she shared his story on social media. She went ahead to praise his bravery, saying: &ldquo;My son sent this [referring to a video] and it just made me see how so mature he&rsquo;s become. He has a large heart that can accommodate everyone. May God enlarge his territory.&rdquo;Jeremy believes he&rsquo;s truly favoured by God and his situation could be worse, but he&rsquo;s managing one day at a time.
