About 70 per cent of standard three pupils cannot handle standard two classwork, a study shows.The report by Twaweza East Africa also indicates that 11 per cent of standard eight learners in Kenya cannot do standard two classwork. Twaweza East Africa communication officer Izel Kipruto said declining quality of education in primary schools is alarming.&ldquo;We are facing a crisis in the education sector. It is shocking that poor quality of education is not being addressed,&rdquo; she said.Kipruto spoke at a hotel in Iten, Elgeyo Marakwet county, on Friday. She asked the Education ministry to improve the quality of education in primary schools. In Elgeyo Marakwet, the report says, only 32 per cent of standard three pupils can successfully handle standard two tasks. &ldquo;We can ask ourselves why the remaining 68 per cent of learners lack basic literacy and numeracy skills. They cannot even read a standard two book,&rdquo; Kipruto said. The Twaweza study was conducted in three East African countries to contribute to the improvement of learning among students aged between six and 16 years.
