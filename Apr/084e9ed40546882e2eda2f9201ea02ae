They say the government was only holding the parcel in trust for the clans.A ruling was made in favour of the clans on July 31, 2014. The elders then moved to court seeking orders for the National Land Commission to explain the steps they had put in place to revert the land to them.The court summoned Swazuri to explain why he had not initiated the process close to three years later.Read: MPs throw out 'hostile witness' Swazuri from committee hearing
