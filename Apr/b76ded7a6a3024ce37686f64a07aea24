Mathare United beat Gor Mahia 1-0 to deny the 15-time champion a chance to assume the top spot yesterday at Thika Stadium.First-half strike at the half-hour mark from Cliff Nyakeya was enough to sink his former employers and see the slum boys bag the three points and grab their second win for the season.Crispin Oduor played a clever pass to find Cliff Nyakeya in the far post and the former Gor Mahia Youth player didn&rsquo;t disappoint. He slotted the ball into the net past Boniface Oluoch to give Mathare the lead, and the winner.It was a case of missed chances as K&rsquo;Ogalo did everything right in both halves but failed to put the ball into the net. Meddie Kagere continued to heap pressure onto Mathare&rsquo;s defence but the back line was solid for the entire 90.In the 29th minute, Gor almost grabbed the opener but Mathare United custodian Levis Opiyo was equal to the task with a full stretch to deny Kagere.Even after Nyakeya&rsquo;s goal, the green army continued to launch a streak of attacks in the slum boys&rsquo; danger zone in search of an equaliser but it was all in vain.Mathare&rsquo;s assistant coach Salim Ali had made two changes to the starting line-up, bringing in Andrew Juma and Harrison Mwendwa. He even switched Daniel Mwaura to right back.The win saw Mathare United climb to 12th position on the log with nine points. Gor Mahia remain second with 16 points.Elsewhere, Zoo Kericho beat Ulinzi Stars 2-1 at Afraha Stadium, Nakuru to taste their first Premier League victory. Zoo drew first blood in the 15th minute courtesy of Geoffrey Gichana before Ulinzi Stars restored parity in the 32 minute through Churchill Muloma. Ulinzi had a chance to make it 2-1 when they were awarded a penalty at the death of the first half but Daniel Waweru hit the post despite sending Zoo&rsquo;s custodian Vincent Misikhu the wrong way. Zoo grabbed the winner in the 69th minute courtesy of Bernard Odhiambo.
