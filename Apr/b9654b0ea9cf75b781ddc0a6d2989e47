Questions have been raised over the credibility of the ODM primaries in Kilifi county after the winners were issued with nomination certificates in secrecy.The primaries were held on Saturday and certificates issued on Sunday in Kilifi town.Party supporters and observers who had converged on the ODM headquarters to witness the issuance of the certificates were shocked when they saw photos of candidates being issued with certificates at an undisclosed location.The first to be issued with the certificate was woman rep Aisha Jumwa, who is eyeing the Malindi MP seat.&ldquo;This raises eyebrows. How on earth are certificates being issued on the beach yet the party has an office?&rdquo; Michael Kenga, from Sokoni ward, said.
