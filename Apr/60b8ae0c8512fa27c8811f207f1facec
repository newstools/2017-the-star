Progressive Party of Kenya (PPK) national women leader Esther Aleyo caused drama at the Vihiga county headquarters on Tuesday.She threatened to strip naked after being roughed up by angry party supporters who accused her of betraying the party.The woman was part of a Bunyore delegation which paid a courtesy call on President Uhuru Kenyatta at State House two weeks ago.Aleyo, who had gone into hiding since she came from State House, resurfaced after she thought that story had cooled down.Read: Bunyore delegation says it has no apologies to make for State House visitThe woman leader was denied entry to the headquarters after she sought audience Vihiga governor Moses Akaranga.After an exchange of words with the security, word went round that the 'most wanted traitor was in the building'.The youths, largely PPK supporters now backing NASA, accused her of tarnishing Akaranga's name during the Nairobi trip.The national super alliance brings together opposition leaders eying to remove Uhuru from the seat in August.It comprises Raila Odinga (ODM), Musalia Mudavadi (ANC), Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper), and Moses Wetang'ula (Ford-K)."She has really embarrassed our party. Despite being a very senior official, she sneaked and went to State House," one of the supporters said."We have distanced our party from the visit. The hour of reckoning has come," an official who sought anonymity said.Aleyo tried to explain herself but Akaranga's supporters who were angered by her action pounced on her.Her attempt to shout the governor's name to rescue her fell on deaf ears. She started hurling insults at the security officers.Tired of her behaviour, Akaranga's supporters frog-marched the smartly dressed party official to the gate.It was here that she threatened to strip naked, to the amusement of the crowd attracted by the commotion.She remained at the gate for hours and shouted: "Uhuru amenizalia njaa." (Visiting Uhuru has caused me hunger).Aleyo boarded a motorbike when heavy rains started pounding the area.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
