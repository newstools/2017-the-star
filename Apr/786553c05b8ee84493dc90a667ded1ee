Besieged National Land Commission boss Muhammad Swazuri&rsquo;s troubles escalated yesterday after five of his commissioners disowned him regarding a controversial transaction.The commissioners said they became suspicious over compensation for land reserved for the standard gauge railway after the chairman decided to make unilateral decisions.They said Swazuri ran a one-man show and excluded them when making key decisions.Commissioner Abdikadir Sheriff said most payments for SGR compensation were done when he and his colleagues were away from the office.Speaking when they appeared before the Lands committee, which is probing a petition seeking Swazuri&rsquo;s sacking, the commissioners said they were not provided with necessary correspondence.&ldquo;A lot of payments were done in December, when most of us were away. I wrote to the CEO demanding a schedule of SGR payments from October to December. I also asked for copies of gazette notices regarding the parcels of land. I asked for those things to be provided to me within seven days, but they were not provided&hellip; as a commissioner, I am very uncomfortable with what happened,&rdquo; Sheriff said.Swazuri is accused of receiving bribes.The petition was filed by former journalist Mugo Njeru. He accused Swazuri of authorising a Sh82 million payment to Bakresh Grain Millers, a Tanzanian company. Njeru is disputing the ownership of the land.Documents tabled before the commission indicate the land was registered in the name of his wife, Edith Mugo.Although the commission was yet to determine whether the land was on a railway reserve, the petitioner claims Swazuri went ahead to authorise payment.Another commissioner, Silas Kinoti said there was no meeting during which the compensation was approved. &ldquo;There are no minutes reinstating the land,&rdquo; he said.Lands CS Jacob Kaimenyi said the commission irregularly revoked the land.The CS told the House team a notice of revocation was incomplete as it failed to give reasons for doing so.&ldquo;Despite the notice of acquisition, the same was revoked. The reasons for the revocation were not indicated. Ordinarily, they would be,&rdquo; Kaimenyi said.
