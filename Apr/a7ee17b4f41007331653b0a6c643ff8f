A number of MPs and MCAs have lost their bids to defend their seats in the Jubilee nominations conducted in Nakuru county on Wednesday. By press time former NTSA chairman Lee Kinyanjui had 223,583 votes, ahead of the incumbent, Kinuthia Mbugua, who had 139,734 votes. Former Nacada chairman John Mututho was a distant third with results in from 10 out of 11 subcounties. Provisional results showed former Nakuru county Education officer Joseph Tonui leading the race in Kuresoi South with 12,271 votes while his closest competitor had 10,654 votes. Among the MPs who have lost include Molo’s Jacob Macharia, Njoro’s Joseph Kiuna and Naivasha’s John Kihagi. There are 11 MPs serving 11 subcounties in Nakuru. In Kuresoi North, the incumbent, Moses Cheboi, floored Alice Cheruiyot after he topped in more than half the polling stations. The former Kanu MP, who recently decamped to Jubilee, has been working closely with Deputy President William Ruto and CS Charles Keter. He was branded ‘the flying MP who cannot be accessed by the common man’. In Molo, the youthful Kimani Kuria was ahead of current MP Jacob Macharia, who has been accused by residents of running down the constituency. Kuria has worked as a Catholic Church accountant. Voting was still going on in Njoro, but sources told the Star that Kiuna was likely to lose. In Kuresoi South, Tonui was optimistic he would defeat Zakayo Cheruiyot, defend his seat on the CCM ticket. Senator Liza Chelule has received overwhelming support from Kuresoi, Molo, Rongai and Njoro, and is expected to send home woman rep Mary Mbugua. In Rongai, Kibet Komen, an ally of Ruto, clinched the MP ticket, while all the five MCAs were sent packing.
