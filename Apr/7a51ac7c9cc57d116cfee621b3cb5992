Mandera Senator Billow Kerrow on Saturday launched the Economic Freedom Party, a political vehicle for aspirants eyeing elective seats in the region. Speaking at the KICC, Nairobi, he asked the electorate to vote for candidates who will run on the party ticket.Deputy Governor Omar Maalim, who is seeking the Mandera East parliamentary seat, Mandera South MP Adan Huka and former provincial commissioner Hassan Noor, the Garre Council of Elders preferred candidate for governor, were in attendance.Kerrow said he is confident the party will clinch most of the seats in the county.&ldquo;From here, we will now hit the ground running as we traverse the county to seek votes from our people. We are sure of carrying the day because we have the blessings of the elders,&rdquo; Kerrow said.Hassan Noor said the party&rsquo;s agenda is to push for equitable distribution of resources and champion the interests of the community in the region.Last week, Mandera Governor Ali Roba, elected on the URP ticket, slammed Kerrow for forming the new party. He said the EFP is for accommodating candidates who have chickened out and fear losing in nominations. Roba says the new political outfit has nothing new to offer residents.
