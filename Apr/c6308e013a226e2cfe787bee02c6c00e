The Court of Appeal has said the use of breathalysers to charge drunk drivers in court is illegal.A three-judge bench on Friday said the laws introduced by NTSA are inconsistent with the Traffic Act.Appeal judges GBM Kariuki, Festus Azangalala and Fatuma Sichale ordered that they be taken back to Parliament for review.The ruling means alcoblow can be used to measure levels of alcohol consumed but that police cannot charge anyone under the rules which established alcoblow.The judges said anyone found drunk-driving should be charged under traffic laws, not alcoblow rules.Rule 3(1) of the breathalyser rules, they said, cannot be used to charge people because it is incapable of creating an offence.The decision arose from an appeal by Kariuki Ruitha who owns Reminisce club on Lang'ata Road in Nairobi.Ruitha, a Ngong resident with 99 per cent shareholding at the Bar, sued the state saying he had been a victim of the use of alcoblow.He told the court that patrons leaving the club were regularly checked for alcohol consumption by police.Ruitha was of the view that the introduction and use of alcoblow violated his rights because the constitution gives Kenyans the power to make lifestyle decisions, including how much alcohol to drink.He said because of alcoblow, he has lost 80 per cent business forcing him to lay off 29 employees and 15 artistes.The businessman said his customers were afraid of going to the bar because of the risk of getting arrested.Ruitha challenged the validity of the law that brought into existence alcoblow saying it contravened his rights and the constitution.In March 2014, a court ruled that two cases that sought to abolish the breathalysers be argued together.Justice Mumbi Ngugi consolidated the first case filed by Richard Ogendo and the second one by Ruitha.Pottermark Enterprises, the company that supplies the gadgets under the Alco-blow brand was also involved as an interested party.Read: Alcoblow cases mergedAlso read: Government ordered to respond to alcoblow case within 21 daysOn June 9, 2014 High Court judge David Majanja found that the transport ministry had powers to make rules, among them measures for enforcing traffic laws.Majanja held that the rules were valid as the public was involved in their making. He further noted that the personal fundamental freedom cited by the businessman was not absolute and could be limited by law.Justice Majanja then dismissed the businessman's case saying there was no evidence his right to dignity was contravened.Aggrieved by this, Ruitha moved to the Appeal court to challenge the ruling.The Appeal court judges said they expected further action by the respondents as the need to prohibit drunk-driving is dire and the matter is of great public interest.The National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) said in a statement that it will continue using breathalyzers to arrest drunk drivers.Director General Francis Meja said the ruling on Friday by the court of appeal dismissed the whole appeal and upheld the high court decision."The court noted that the breathalyzer rules did not introduce any new offenses other than those in the Traffic Act adding that there is need to amend the Traffic Act to realign it to the breathalyzer rules," he stated."NTSA informs members of the public that driving under the influence of alcohol is an offense and that the Authority will continue to execute its mandate so as to keep our roads safe," Meja added.
