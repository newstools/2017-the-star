Cereal Millers Association has said maize floor prices have begun to drop after release of maize by the National Cereals and Produce Board to the lobby&rsquo;s members.The body said millers were getting 60 per cent of the 750,000 bags being released by the government, translating to 450,000 bags from NCPB.Maize collection by members which began on April 7 will continue for at least another 10 days.&ldquo;We expect that the retailers will pass on the change on ex-factory prices to the consumer. If this happens, we expect shelf prices to settle between Sh115 and Sh125 per two-kilo packet,&rdquo; CMA chairman Nick Hutchinson said yesterday.The lobby, however, projected the maize being released will only last members between eight and 12 days depending on market demand.&ldquo;In the meantime, we are encouraging the government to urgently pursue regional interventions to ensure that maize supply returns to normalcy,&rdquo; Hutchinson said.Last week, the millers received one million bags of cheaper maize from the Strategic Food Reserve. The country is also expected to receive maize from Ethiopia in a deal aimed at easing the current maize shortage locally.Last week, the price of a two- kilo packet of maize flour rose to a historic high of Sh153.
