Candidates interested in heading the Financial Reporting Centre, the state agency charged with identifying proceeds of crime and fighting money laundering, have three days to apply. FRC, established under the Proceeds of Crime and Anti Money Laundering (Amendment) Act 2012, has largely been operating under staff seconded from the Central Bankl of Kenya. The successful candidate for the position of director-general will be required to establish and maintain strong relationships with key stakeholders to promote an effective and synchronised approach to anti-money laundering compliance, the FRC said in an advertisement. A US report by the Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs on international narcotics control strategy, released last month, named Kenya among countries whose financial institutions engage in currency transactions involving significant amounts from international narcotics trafficking. Financial institutions are required to report all transactions above $10,000 (about Sh1.03 million) to the FRC or risk hefty penalties. The Proceeds of Crime and Anti-Money Laundering (Amendment) Act 2017, assented to by President Uhuru Kenyatta on March 3, has slapped a fine of Sh5 million and Sh25 million on individuals and corporates found guilty of money laundering. "This is a major tool in our sustained efforts to fight corruption. It means that no proceeds of theft and corruption are beyond the reach of the state," Uhuru said on March 3, referring to the amended law. The FRC chief executive will be the secretary to the high-profile Anti-Money Laundering Advisory Board. The board's membership comprises the PS for Treasury (Kamau Thugge), the Attorney General (Githu Muigai), Central Bank of Kenya governor (Patrick Njoroge), Kenya Bankers Association chair (Lamin Manjang) and ICPAK chief executive (Patrick Ngumi). The board also has two experts in money laundering matters to represent the private sector.
