Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong has predicted a split in ODM, irrespective of who wins in the primaries between him and rival Paul Otuoma on April 13th.He said on Saturday ODM enjoys 90 per cent support in the county, but this could drop, thanks to the party headquarters, which has failed in its intelligence at the grassroots.Ojaamong urged Orange House to study political dynamics in Busia and rectify anomalies as soon as possible to forestall exodus of members.&ldquo;Some of us have been die-hard supporters of ODM, but the party headquarters gave direct nominations to some people who cannot utter an ODM slogan,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;ODM is doing little to maintain its dominance over other parties.&rdquo;The party offered nomination certificates to only those who are unopposed.The county boss said he is confident of winning the primaries, but expressed pessimism about Otuoma supporting him.&ldquo;It is also unlikely that my supporters will agree to back him [if he wins],&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Top officials of the party at Orange House are silent and expect things to be smooth.&rdquo;He accused the police of abetting violence by leaving perpetrators to go scot-free, adding that victims could retaliate, hence making the county ungovernable.&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been a victim of such targetted violence. During our Funyula rally, a man who tried to block my convoy was arrested and handed over to the police but was released,&rdquo; he said.
