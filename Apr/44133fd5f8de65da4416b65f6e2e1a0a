The prosecution yesterday attempted to link a police pocket radio to the main suspect in the brutal murder of human rights lawyer Willie Kimani and two others.Witnesses, including Mlolongo OCS Stephen Lelei, last week said the gadget had been issued to Fredrick Leliman.The prosecution&rsquo;s theory is that the pocket radio was traced to the suspected site of the killings on June 23, 2016.It is the same night that Kimani, his client Josephat Mwenda and taxi driver Joseph Muiruri are said to have been murdered in cold blood.A witness yesterday said Leliman, who headed an undercover police unit of five known as &ldquo;Spiv&rdquo;, had been allocated a pocket radio a few days before.While giving evidence before Justice Jessie Lesiit, Wilson Kamau, a police driver whose work was to chauffeur Spiv members, also confirmed that Leliman had the radio on June 22.But he was off duty the following day and could not tell who used it on June 23.The witness described the vehicle Spiv used as KBF 876 E, a lost and found car that was allocated to them by the late Mlolongo OCS, who died in an accident a few months before the incident.Previously, another police officer told the court that he saw three people at the suspected killing field the night the three men were murdered.Paul Mitambo said he questioned the three, who told him they were police officers. He said that he believed them because one of them had a police pocket radio.Leliman is charged alongside Leonard Maina, a member of the Spiv team, Stephen Chebulet, Silvia Wanjiku and informer Peter Ngugi.They have denied killing Kimani, Mwenda and Muiruri and dumping their bodies in the Oldonyo Sabuk River.It is suspected the three men were abducted by the officers as they left the Mavoko law courts and were taken to Syokimau AP camp, where they were detained for hours without being booked. Kimani threw a note to a boda boda rider.
