Herders from Pokot have invaded Agricultural Development Corporation farms in Trans Nzoia county. They have destroyed more than 1,000 acres of maize seed.Chief executive Richard Aiyabe said they are unable to control the invasion, which may lead to shortage of maize seed. He has asked the police to intervene and stop the herders.They have invaded the Swam Orchard ADC farms near the border between West Pokot and Trans Nzoia.&ldquo;The herders go round looking for pasture even at night and allow the animals to graze on the maize seed,&rdquo; Aiyabe said. Drought has already affected germination of the seed and the destruction by herders would cause heavy shortage.&ldquo;We have liaised with the police bosses in Trans Nzoia to help us deal with the problem. We expect action, but as ADC we cannot deal with this on our own,&rdquo; the CEO said. ADC is the second-largest producer of seeds after the Kenya Seed Company. Aiyabei said the corporation will work on other programmes to educate communities on the need to protect the seed farms. Meanwhile, Kenya Seed has reported the spread of army worms in Trans Nzoia.
