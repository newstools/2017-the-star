The construction of a Sh1 billion commercial building on the banks of Ngong River along Lang&rsquo;ata Road is nearing completion, even as Nairobi Lands executive Christopher Khaemba says it will not get an occupation certificate.Khaemba said Nairobi county has notified the developer of the five-storey building, Bobasi MP Stephen Manoti, that his building is among those listed for demolition by an inter-agency committee.The committee was formed to audit unsafe buildings and those built on wetlands.It brings together officers from the National Construction Authority, National Environment Management Authority, ministries of Interior, Lands and Housing, Environment, and Water, the NYS and the Office of the Attorney General.Khaemba said the committee was set up to identify and compile a list of buildings constructed on riparian and wetlands to be demolished by December last year, but has had delays.Demolitions begin in MayHe said the work is almost complete and demolitions are expected to resume next month, and Manoti&rsquo;s building is among those listed.Construction workers were doing final touches on the building expected to house a 92-bed hotel and shops when the Star visited on Friday.But Khaemba said, &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter what they are doing. We will not approve occupation of that building&rdquo;.&ldquo;We have not issued an occupation certificate and we will not because the building is unsafe as it stands on a wetland. We have already informed Manoti of its pending demolition.&rdquo;Khaemba added that the building has been interfering with the flow of the river, causing flooding in South C, Nairobi West, Lang&rsquo;ata and adjacent areas.The building has been flooded every rainy season and Nairobi MCAs, led by speaker Alex Magelo, assessed it and demanded its demolition in 2015.In May last year, City Hall gave Manoti two weeks to pull it down.But Manoti went to court and obtained an injunction restraining the county from interfering with the building after he was served with the demolition notice.Yesterday, Khaemba said there are no longer court restrictions and the recommendations of the committee will be implemented.In February last year, NEMA ordered that the building be demolished but did not follow up to ensure the order was complied with.It is not clear whether the NCA has approved its occupation.NCA executive director Daniel Manduku did not answer phone calls from the Star.Construction of buildings on riparian lands, corruption and violation of the law have been blamed for flooding in Nairobi.
