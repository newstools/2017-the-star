A prosecution witness has said the leasing of ambulances from the Kenya Red Cross Society was necessitated by dire needs in Garissa.Mohamed Aden Bare, the former head of procurement in the county, was testifying in a case in which Governor Nathif Jama and six former Tender Committees members are charged with irregular leasing of the ambulances. Bare told Garissa chief magistrate Cosmas Maundu that the procurement committee resolved to award the tender after much deliberation, following a request by the Health department.He said a baseline survey was carried out by the Health department that showed there was high mortality in the county and an urgent need for ambulances.Bare, who was the first prosecution witness, said St John Ambulance and the Red Cross quoted Sh550,000 and Sh600,000, respectively, during the evaluation process, but they chose the Kenya Red Cross as it would maintain its ambulances and assign two paramedics to each ambulance.The case continues until Thursday.
