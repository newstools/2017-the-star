An attempt by Tanzanian singer Rehema Chalamila, alias Ray C, to make a musical comeback elicited a heated debate on social media on Thursday.The mellow-voiced lass, who has been struggling with drug addiction for the past few years, premiered her latest single 'Unanimaliza' on Mambo Mseto, but she didn't get the reaction she was expecting.Here are some of the reactions: Brayo B: I don't have time for a lost and found musician like Ray C whereas Sossuun and Femi One are doing great.Liz Kananu: Sasa huyu Ray C si time yake iliisha? These days we listen to the likes of Vanessa Mdee and Lady Jaydee.Moses Kamau: Is she in Kenya to look for her crush, the President, or to promote her new music? Aiii.
