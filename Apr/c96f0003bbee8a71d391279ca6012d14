Kenyans should expect the price of maize flour to start falling in a weeks&rsquo; time.Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Willy Bett said on Friday that the effects of maize flour, which has increased to a high of Sh142 for a two-kg packet, will start being felt after one week when maize imports from Mexico start arriving.He said the average cost of a 90 kilogramme bag of maize is currently at Sh4,500 and there is fear that the trend could rise up to Sh 5,000.&ldquo;If this continues, the prices of maize flour will be pushed to a high of Sh150 or Sh160 for a two-kg packet. The waiver of duty on imported maize by the government will curb this. Maize from Mexico is the cheapest in the market and it should help reduce the price of maize flour. We are also expecting imports from Ethiopia to start getting into the country soon through the Moyale boarder," Bett said.He maize will trade at Sh4,300 per 90 kg bag but this is also expected to reduce, Betty said.The National Treasury Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich on Thursday during his budget speech, proposed to exempt bread and maize flourfrom VAT. He further removed duty on importation of maize for the next four months.&ldquo;Manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers who sell such goods will be expected to reduce the prices of these basic commodities failure to which i will reverse the policy. This should see a reduction of prices for basic commodities which are enjoyed by majority of Kenyans," Rotich said.Betty however said it was too early to say by how much the prices of maize flour will reduce, but he confirmed within a week, Kenyans will not have to pay so much for a packet of maize flour which has currently surpassed the price of wheat flour, which is selling at Sh123.He said the ministry is in consultation with the millers and they will be monitoring the prices weekly to ensure they come down.Farmers are holding 5.5 million bags of maize, traders are holding three million bags while the National Cereals and Produce Board is holding 1.3 million bags which is not sufficient. The deficit, he said, will be imported from Mexico which he assured Kenyans it is free from GMO.The Kenya Cereal Millers Association chairman Nick Hutchnison said millers are currently operating on 35 per cent capacity, and that the interventions by the government will help stabilize the price of maize flour. millers were non-committal on the new prices of maize flour. &ldquo;The governments' decision to zero rate the essential commodities is a positive move but reducing of prices is a long process that may take time so, consumers should be patient,&rdquo; he said.
