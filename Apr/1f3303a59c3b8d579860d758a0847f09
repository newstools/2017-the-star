The government has created an extra subcounty in Kajiado to make seven national administrative units in the county. Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery on Monday announced Keek-Onyokie subcounty will be carved out of the larger Kajiado West. Residents yesterday welcomed the news. Nkaissery said its headquarters will be  in Olepolos town, while the current one will remain in Iloodokilani, Maili 46 town. He said the decision by the government was informed by the distance between the two towns, which had compelled area deputy county commissioner William ole Kakimoi  to divide his working days to adequately serve the region. Leaders in Kajiado West led by politician Joseph ole Simel in a meeting with Governor David Nkedianye had complained Kakimoi could be absent from office for two weeks. But area MP Moses Sakuda explained that the administrator had to divide his month into two weeks to sit in Maili 46 for 14 days and serve from Olepolos for the remaining days. Sakuda thanked the government for the extra subcounty.
