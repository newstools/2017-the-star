Kenya region where there are issues to do with human-wildlife conflict," he said.Nyamu said that though Kenya is one of the four African countries with the highest number of elephants, the population has been reducing drastically because of poaching and human-wildlife conflict.He said the public has not been properly sensitised on the need to conserve the Wildlife.Data from Africa Elephant Database shows that the number of elephants in Kenya has reduced from 130, 834 in 1995 to 25,292 in 2013.He said that over 80 per cent of Kenya&rsquo;s elephants are found outside protected areas and over 78 per cent of poaching is reported outside the protected areas.&ldquo;We want to collect the views of Kenyans on how to conserve wildlife and mitigate human-wildlife conflict and how to reduce poaching within their regions,&rdquo; he said.Nyamu, who has studied elephants in Kenya and Africa for 16 years, has walked over 5000 Kms raising awareness on the plight of elephant and rhino poaching.Ambassador O&rsquo;Neill said that his government is committed to supporting wildlife conservation efforts to preserve Kenya&rsquo;s heritage.&ldquo;Wildlife is central to Kenyan heritage and the preservation of wildlife is so important for the future of the country,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;We are going to walk with him [Nyamu] and as an embassy, we are providing 100 footballs and volleyballs so that that they can be part of his education messaging as he traverses the communities,&rdquo; he said.Read; Seized ivory almost exclusively from recent poaching - study
