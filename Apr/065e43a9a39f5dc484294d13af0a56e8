Hundreds of police officers who graduated in December last year are yet to get salary hikes.A police officer recruited at the constable level - with only a high school certificate - earns a basic salary of Sh17,000. The pay is increased to at least Sh36,000 after an officer acquires a degree. But the National Police Service froze the salary reviews, citing the high number of officers obtaining degrees.The officers, mainly constables, say the NPS human resources department told them it stopped salary hikes for constables who get degrees while in service.The officers said they took out loans of up to Sh500,000 for undergraduate studies and are now unable to repay.The officers, mainly in the rank of constables, sergeants, and senior sergeants were told HR has written to the Salaries and Remuneration Commission for advice.&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know where the SRC is coming in because all other government officers get their salaries alignments upon furthering their education. Why is it different with us? All we are being told is that our certificates are with the Deputy IG [Samuel Arachi] ,&rdquo; an AP officer, who sought anonymity said,.NPS spokesman George Kinoti did not answer calls or respond to messages inquiring about the officers&rsquo; complaints.The officers want National Police Service Commission chairman Johnston Kavuludi to help solve the problem.&ldquo;It is getting unbearable as some of us are getting as low as Sh7,000, which is hardly enough even to feed ourselves. We wonder why the NPS has turned its back on us yet they approved our requests to undertake the degree courses,&rdquo; an officer said.
