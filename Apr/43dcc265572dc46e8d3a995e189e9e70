Leaders have been warned against politicising government water projects. Former Irrigation PS Patrick Nduati (pictured) said the government aims to construct 140 dams in arid and semi-arid areas to increase water usage per capita. He spoke in Nakuru on Saturday. Nduati said the state aims to increase water usage per capita by 50 per cent through water harvesting.He urged legislators to work closely with both the county and national governments and pool resources. Bahati MP Kimani Ngunjiri said population increase has contributed to water scarcity. He criticised the opposition for speaking against water projects.&ldquo;They always complain of underdevelopment, but this is not the case. They should give the government credit where it is due,&rdquo; Ngunjiri said. Water CS Eugene Wamalwa and Nduati had traded barbs over the awarding of the tender to build Thwake Dam.
