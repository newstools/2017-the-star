The giving of Easter eggs is an annual springtime tradition that children all over the world look forward to every year. But alarming new research suggests youngsters will eat their way through a shocking amount of chocolate this year that will add up to as many as 17,700 calories.The average child in Britain will receive an astonishing 13 Easter eggs from family, friends and even teachers this year, as well as plenty of chocolatey treats on the side, according to a new survey.The amount of sugar in their Easter haul is the same as in 200 Krispy Kreme doughnuts, or 263 chocolate eclairs.More than 2,000 parents with children under the age of 15 were surveyed for the study by Wren Kitchens to find out just how much chocolate they are expected to receive over the holiday.The experts discovered that the average child is expected to receive an enormous chocolate haul over the four-day bank holiday weekend in April, that adds up to 17,700 calories and 2,000g of sugar.That's double the recommended allowance for a child aged between seven and 10 across the four-day period.The chocolate bonanza also contains ten times the amount of sugar they should consume across the bank holiday weekend, adding up to an alarming picture.Registered nutritionist Charlotte Stirling-Reed said of the findings: 'As a registered nutritionist, I'm not here to take all the fun out of Easter, but these figures are quite alarming."It's easy to see how the numbers can easily add up over an Easter weekend. "Additionally, if we were to combine these figures with those from other occasions when children are likely to overindulge (such as Christmas, birthdays, parties, holidays, weekends) you can see how it may become less of a treat and more of a regular occurrence. "Add this to the fact that many children eat chocolates and sweets every day, and then their intake of calories, fat and sugar really become a concern. "There are plenty of ways to celebrate family occasions and events such as Easter without relying on chocolate and sweets. "Fun activities and trips together, playing games, picnics and even doing some baking at home can all be just as enjoyable and much more healthy too."
