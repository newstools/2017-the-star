Kilifi woman representative Aisha Jumwa &mdash; seeking the ODM Malindi MP nomination &mdash; and hundreds of supporters say if a direct ticket is awarded to someone else, there will be trouble.Jumwa on Thursday said she would make a major announcement if ODM does not ensure fair nominations. Defection was is the air.She and supporters demanded the ODM National Elections Board and boss Raila Odinga assure them of free and fair nominations &mdash; no direct ticket to MP Willing Mtengo who won the by-election.Hundreds of supporters demanded clarity on Malindi nominations or else they defect with Jumwa.They staged protests all over town on Thursday, accusing Governor Amason Kingi of plotting to give Mtengo a direct ticket. But Kingi said the people will decide, not the party.They chanted &ldquo;Kingi must go, Kingi must go&rdquo;, accusing him of trying to dictate who should get the ODM ticket, instead ensuring fair nominations.Drama unfolded from early in the morning when the supporters converged at the Market Village after word went round that the governor had convened a meeting of all aspirants in Kilifi to decide on favourites.The protesters said they were against Kingi&rsquo;s &ldquo;dictatorship&rdquo; and warned him to either act within 12 hours or they decamp.They promised to stop the nominations if there&rsquo;s no communication from the head office. They chanted that they would take &ldquo;deadly&rdquo; political action that would cost the party not only Malindi but all of Kilifi county.Resident Paul Mzungu warned that Kingi might breaking up the party.&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll not allow the governor to dictate who becomes the ODM candidate in Malindi constituency. Our choice is Aisha Jumwa and no one else,&rdquo; he said.Mzungu said Mtengo was only given an opportunity to serve during the by-election and it is time for Jumwa, who is more popular, to take over.&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not opposed to nominations but want them to be fair and fair, or else we shall move out of ODM and choose a party of our own desire,&rdquo; he said.Jumwa later joined her supporters and maintained that the ODM Elections Board and the party leader must give direction within 12 hours or she makes a major declaration.&ldquo;ODM should not play with the power of the people. Already in Magarini there is no ODM since 2013, Kaloleni and Ganze are following suit because of a leader who wants to dictate to the people of Kilifi county whom to elect,&rdquo; she said.Jumwa said she has fought hard for ODM locally and nationally, adding there is a court case against her.&ldquo;I call for free and fair nominations. ODM is not a business entity. The Elections Board should give us direction, or else tomorrow, I will make a major declaration,&rdquo; she said.Another supporter Boaz Kiir said he is ready to die for Jumwa to ensure she gets the ticket. The legislator later led supporters in protests all over the town, bringing business to a standstill.Meantime, other ODM contestants, including Mtengo, were in a meeting to deliberate on nominations.After the meeting, Mtengo denied he was among those who had been handed a direct ticket. He said those spreading propaganda were only seeking sympathy votes from residents.Kingi said he has no preferred candidate, adding aspirants will have to seek the support of voters.
