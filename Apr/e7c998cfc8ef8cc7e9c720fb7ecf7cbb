Social activist-turned-politician Boniface Mwangi has joined the list of other worldwide activists castigating Pepsi for their insensitive TV advert. It showed Kendall Jenner ending a face-off between protesters and police by handing a cop a can of soda, leading to cheers by the protesters."Let me tell you, forget about Pepsi. If you gave the police a cold Tusker in a protest, they will smash it over your head. It is an advertisement failure," Boniface said. "It's is a white supremacy complex. Pepsi blundered in a very big way by trying to use the social movement, Black Lives Matter. The reason why people are complaining is because Pepsi trivialised the issue by showing a soda could solve or break the mistrust between police and the community or the community and the government. They took something close to people's hearts and commercialised it. It backfired on them."Bernice King, daughter of Martin Luther King Jr, criticised the ad herself, tweeting, "If only Daddy would have known about the power of #Pepsi.&rdquo;Boniface concluded: "Instead of apologising to the social movement they are apologising to the actress. You did not offend her, you offended an entire social movement across the world by saying you can face a police baton and teargas with a can of soda. That is being plainly stupid."
