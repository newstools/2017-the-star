Siaya residents have urged Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo to shun uncalled-for propaganda against Governor Cornel Rasanga.They warned the National Assembly deputy minority leader against his continued onslaught on Rasanga, saying his efforts to malign the county boss will not work. The residents, six Siaya subcounties, on Tuesday took issue with Midiwo&rsquo;s recent claim that Rasanga was in State House to seal a deal with President Uhuru Kenyatta over the sale of Yala Swamp, terming it &ldquo;the cheapest propaganda, which can never be tolerated&rdquo;.They addressed the press in Siaya town. Led by Felix Omondi, they said such remarks are a recipe for chaos ahead of ODM primaries. Omondi told Midiwo that he risks being sent into political oblivion if he continues attacking the governor, urging the MP instead to focus on winning the ODM ticket.
