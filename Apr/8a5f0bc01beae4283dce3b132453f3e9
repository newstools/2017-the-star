The ongoing ODM primaries are being closely monitored by several foreign missions.They include the US, UK, Canada and Germany, which have teams of observers.Although development partners usually monitor the General Election, this time tracking has been extended to party primaries.Dozens of observers are stationed at Orange House - the ODM headquarters - where they are keeping an eye on results trickling in from various areas.They are also monitoring the dispute resolution process to check if opposition chief Raila Odinga&rsquo;s party lives up to the democratic ideals it professes. The foreign officials intensified their vigilance yesterday by interviewing aspirants and their supporters who had camped at Orange House.Some aspirants protested against results and demanded nomination certificates. The observers have also dispatched teams to ODM hotspots.The hotspots include Kisumu, Migori, Homa Bay, Siaya, Busia, Kisii and Nairobi.The countries commit substantial financial support to the country&rsquo;s electoral system through the IEBC.&ldquo;We are keenly monitoring the nominations as part of our normal election monitoring process,&rdquo; Pannel Jamie, from the Canadian High Commission, said.He told the Star that while Western countries do not directly finance party primaries, they have stepped up their observer mission to check if their processes guarantee democracy.The observers have been accredited by the IEBC and ODM and will compile a report, which they will make public at the end of the exercise.Other countries under the EU are monitoring not just the ODM nominations, but also those of the ruling Jubilee Party.
