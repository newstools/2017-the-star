&ldquo;Who are you in this story?&rdquo; Mr N asks, shifting his gaze to me. We are discussing Shakespeare&rsquo;s Othello.&ldquo;Desdemona,&rdquo; I reply. He pauses. &ldquo;Not Lago?&rdquo; he asks and then laughs at my frown.&ldquo;First of all you don&rsquo;t blindly trust me,&rdquo; I say. &ldquo;Secondly, you ask for whom I have feelings for when it is obvious they are for you. Thirdly, I think you&rsquo;re jealous, which is self defeatist because I need to sleep with other people to make you money.&rdquo; Mr N raises a sardonic brow. &ldquo;You are not Desdemona. Lago manipulates with his words, as you do. You expect me to believe you have feelings for me and you&rsquo;re about to screw my friend here?&rdquo;Just at that moment, all the conversation at the table has halted and the song that was playing in the background has just ended. His words are heard clearly by all. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on bruh?&rdquo; Nabil protests. &ldquo;I thought you brought her for me?&rdquo; Mr N, Nabil, his younger brother and I are at the Lebanese restaurant. They&rsquo;re all looking at me expectantly. &ldquo;Brought me here for you?&rdquo; I ask sweetly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a choice in the matter?&rdquo;Nabil shifts in his chair. &ldquo;You do, you do&hellip; I just meant&hellip;&rdquo; His voice trails off at a loss for words. There&rsquo;s an awkward silence. I need to take hold of the situation. I stand up and walk towards Nabil. I boldly sit on his lap, facing him. I then slowly extend my neck towards him and press my lips against his. His lips immediately partially open and I suck on his bottom lip. This goes on for a full minute as his brother and Mr N watch. I can feel him getting aroused. I bite gently on the lip I had been sucking on and he groans. He&rsquo;s obviously enjoying this. I stop, kiss him lightly and then stand up. &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; he protests. I don&rsquo;t answer. I then go to Mr N and sit on his lap. He is looking at me quizzically, slightly amused. I say nothing and pull his head towards mine.Mr N doesn&rsquo;t need a second invitation and crushes his lips against mine. His lips part, as do mine, and he proceeds to suck the breath out of me. When he finally lets go, we are both breathing heavily. I stand up and head back to my seat.&ldquo;You just meant what?&rdquo; I ask Nabil nonchalantly as I sip my drink. &ldquo;My apologies. You clearly hold all the cards here,&rdquo; he says.&ldquo;So who is the better kisser?&rdquo; his brother asks.That&rsquo;s a tricky question. If I say either on them is better, the other will be offended. I deflect. &ldquo;Are you feeling left out?&rdquo; I ask him.I&rsquo;ve caught him off guard with the question and he looks flustered. Nabil answers on his behalf.&ldquo;We share many things with my brother. I&rsquo;d give him the shirt on my back but never my woman.&rdquo; Mr N chimes in. &ldquo;Your woman?&rdquo;&ldquo;Soon, she will be,&rdquo; Nabil responds and takes a drag at his Shisha pipe. &ldquo;I like a confident man,&rdquo; I say. Mr N gets out his wallet and leaves a wad of notes on the table. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave you to work on that,&rdquo; he says to Nabil. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to go,&rdquo; Nabil says. &ldquo;Healthy competition is good.&rdquo;&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t compete. She sat on your lap first,&rdquo; Mr N says in mock exasperation.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sitting right here,&rdquo; I say, wondering why they are discussing me in my presence.Mr N leans over and kisses me on the mouth. &ldquo;Be gentle with my friend,&rdquo; he says.
