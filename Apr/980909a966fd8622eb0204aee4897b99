Following the demise of his loving grandfather, William Ajengo, on March 20, Radio Jambo presenter Joseph Ogidi, popularly known as Gidi Gidi, took a week-long break from his studio duties to mourn and bury the man he was closely attached to.His grandfather, who once served as a senior chief, died at the age of 92 after a short illness.The breakfast presenter, alongside his co-host Jacob &lsquo;Ghost&rsquo; Mulee, are widely known for their efforts in reconciling and bringing families together, especially those whose marriages have hit rock bottom, in Patanisho (reconciliation), a popular segment on the Gidi na Ghost breakfast show.Through the years, the presenters have solved various family disputes, including deadbeat dads, wives and husbands who sleep with their in-laws, families battling incest cases, as well as helping drunk and cheating couples reform.Speaking of reconciliation, Gidi who rose to fame back in 2002 when he released the popular hit song &lsquo;Unbwogable&rsquo; alongside Majimaji, revealed that his late grandfather had eight wives, and never did his grandfather need to conduct a &lsquo;patanisho&rsquo; among them.&ldquo;My grandfather had eight beautiful wives and what&rsquo;s surprising is the fact that they all love each other unconditionally till now,&rdquo; Gidi said. &ldquo;Three of them passed on and five of them are alive. They are simply inseparable. Leave alone those who complain of being troubled by just one wife, [my grand dad] had no problem dealing with eight!&rdquo;
