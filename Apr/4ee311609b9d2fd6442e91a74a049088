Foreign diplomats should not blow Kenya&rsquo;s state of security out of proportion ahead of the August 8 polls as it will undermine the tourism sector, Cabinet Secretary Najib Balala has said.Disputes and wrangles during election is a global issue hence Kenya is not exceptional, hence diplomats should not create fear to tourists wishing to travel to the country.&ldquo;I want to appeal to all the foreign diplomats here not to overreact. We have held elections before, in 2013, and they were peaceful,&rdquo; Balala said.He spoke in reaction to a travel warning issued by the US State Department on April 6 cautioning Americans residing in, or traveling to Kenya, of the possible violence in the run-up to the August 8 polls.&ldquo;Rallies, demonstrations and protests may occur with little notice and even those intended to be peaceful can escalate into violence,&rdquo; the notice stated, &ldquo;As with all large events, there is also the opportunity for criminal elements or terrorists to target participants and visitors.&rdquo;There have been a number of cases of violence that have occurred in the country ahead of party primaries which started yesterday . Among them is the chaos in Migori during an ODM rally on April 3. Violence also erupted during a Jubilee Party delegates election in Laikipia county on December 15.Balala said Kenyans should behave well and own up to their actions adding that the recent cases of violence did not set a good precedent. He condemned the opposition leaders saying that actions should be taken on those associating in violent actions.&ldquo;National Democratic Institute should talk to the opposition and warn them and start listing them to go to the ICC because they are the ones who are burning this country, they want to be leaders by force, trying to force themselves onto the people,&rdquo; Balala said.He said leaders should not be allowed to destroy the country.&ldquo;The tourism sector should not suffer because of a few individuals during the election period as it has in the past election years,&rdquo; Balala said.In March, the UK foreign office amended its warning against Lamu and Manda regions in the coast saying British tourists can now travel safely .
