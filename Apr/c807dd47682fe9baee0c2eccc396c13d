Kisumu Deputy Governor Ruth Odinga has pulled out of the governor&rsquo;s race but says she would like to be a running mate.Ruth, the sister of NASA principal Raila Odinga, on Sunday said she did not pay a nomination fee.With her exit, Governor Jack Ranguma, Senator Anyang&rsquo; Nyong&rsquo;o, businessman Hezron Mc&rsquo;Obewa and Gordon Wayumba will compete for the ODM ticket.Ruth said she is interested in being a running mate to whoever wins the ODM primary. She is still looking for the best suitor, she said.Ruth addressed a press conference in Kisumu town, where she said she will continue to discharge her duties as the county&rsquo;s number two.She criticised a pollster for giving her a low popularity rating for governor, saying she wasn&rsquo;t even running. She questioned the credibility of the findings, but did not identify the pollster.Ruth said the pollster ought to have sought names submitted by political parties to the IEBC, instead of conducting its own survey.&ldquo;How on earth do you rate someone who is no longer in the race? What is the credibility of such a survey?&rdquo; she said.Mc&rsquo;Obewa also dismissed findings of the opinion poll, saying it will not determine who becomes governor.She said the poll was sponsored and doctored to reflect a premeditated outcome meant to influence the electorate.
