The door opens. A man I&rsquo;ve never seen before walks into the room and someone locks the door behind him.&ldquo;Hello, Samantha,&rdquo; he says.&ldquo;Where am I? WHO ARE YOU?&rdquo; I ask, my voice rising.&ldquo;Relax. All the shouting in the world will not help you here. No one will hear you,&rdquo; he says.&ldquo;Can I&hellip; Can I have some water, please?&rdquo; I ask, noticing the bottle he&rsquo;s holding. He hands it over and watches quietly as I gulp it down.&ldquo;Where is Nabil?&rdquo; I ask after I drain the bottle. &ldquo;Why have you locked me in here?&rdquo;&ldquo;All you need to know is that this is your home for the next six months. Maybe more. It will depend on how popular you are,&rdquo; he responds.&ldquo;Popular? With whom?&rdquo; I ask, a feeling of dread coming over me.&ldquo;With our clients,&rdquo; he responds.&ldquo;What?&rdquo; I ask, not comprehending. &ldquo;What clients?&rdquo;He turns around and bangs on the door. As it&rsquo;s opened from the other side, my human survival instinct kicks in. Harvard University physiologist Walter Cannon described it as the fight or flight response. When humans are faced with danger, they either fight or get the hell out of there. Once the door opens, all I see is freedom on the other end of it. I instinctively act, pushing him out of the way with some superhuman strength I didn&rsquo;t know I had. I&rsquo;m unaware what&rsquo;s happening in my body, but it&rsquo;s simple. My brain&rsquo;s hypothalamus is fully activated, initiating a series of chemical releases. Adrenaline has been released into my blood stream. My heart rate has increased and my impulses are all intensified. Blood is being pumped more quickly into my muscles and limbs, and this is why I have overcome a much larger person than me. It&rsquo;s a phenomenon known as hysterical strength. When he tumbles back, the flight response kicks in and I run. I did not take into account the man on the other side of the door who is ready for me after watching me overcome my captor. He blocks my path. I don&rsquo;t hesitate. I have a direct path to his testicles and I&rsquo;m going for it. I have never hit a man in the nuts before but I&rsquo;ve seen it done in the movies. I smash them directly up into the pelvis bone.&ldquo;Aaaaargh,&rdquo; he screams as he grabs his crotch and closes his legs. &ldquo;You bitch!&rdquo; he squeaks, hardly able to speak.I don&rsquo;t look back as I run down a darkened corridor towards light. There is a kitchen of sorts and a door. It&rsquo;s open. I&rsquo;m almost faint with relief as I rush out. I&rsquo;m going to make it! I hear footsteps behind. One of them is coming after me.Run, Samantha! Run! I mentally will myself to run as fast as humanly possible. I see a gate. If I can get to the road I can flag down a car or find a pedestrian, someone will help me. I get to the gate but it&rsquo;s padlocked. No! Looking over my shoulder, my captor is just a few meters away. I try and climb the gate but my fingers are sliding on the slippery rails, wet, perhaps from rain.&ldquo;Oh please, Lord, please,&rdquo; I pray but it&rsquo;s too late. He grabs me and yanks me to the ground. I start to scream.&ldquo;Help me! Someone please help me!!!!!&rdquo;He covers my mouth with his large palm and drags me back into the house. There&rsquo;s a knife on the kitchen counter. Why didn&rsquo;t I notice that before? I would have grabbed it when I run out. Maybe I could have stabbed him or something. It&rsquo;s too late now. He&rsquo;s taking me back to that horrible, seedy room, down the darkened corridor, away from the light.
