County services have been paralysed following IFMIS' collapse on April 3, Council of Governor chairman Peter Munya said on Monday.He said in a statement that the 47 counties risk being affected further if the Integrated Financial Management System is not restored.Payments for emergency services, development and workers' salaries are the most affected.Munya accused the government of duping them to believe that the system was fool-proof, 'yet it is not the case'.IFMIS is a computer system for procurement and payments for goods and services bought by national and county government agencies.The system was mooted for efficient planning, budgeting, procurement, expenditure management and reporting."Governors view this as a subtle attempt to slow down county governments&rsquo; expenditure as the general elections date draws nearer.""Delivery of services to Kenyans cannot and should not be pegged on elections or any event for that matter," Munya said.The system had collapsed in December 2016, halting county operations including payment of staff salaries."Given the past problems of password mishandling and misappropriation of funds, this is not a good sign.""Something sinister could be going on, yet it is the county leaders who will be blamed," Munya said.Questions on its security were equally raised when NYS lost over Sh1.8 billion, monies said to have been accessed through the system.County governments say they have no personnel to operate the e-procurement system.Read: Treasury insists IFMIS is helping fight corruption
