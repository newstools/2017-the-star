Kiambu Governor William Kabogo (pictured) says his rivals are more interested in sharing power among themselves than economically empower wananchi through fair resource sharing.The county chief is seeking reelection. He said on Wednesday his rivals lack a development agenda and are nothing but self-seekers. Kabogo criticised hopeful David Ngari Gakuyo for allegedly fleecing the poor through Ekesa Sacco. He promised to ensure Gakuyo&rsquo;s passport is held so that he does not leave the country after impoverishing unsuspecting people. The county boss spoke in Kamwangi, Gatundu North, and Mutomo, Gatundu South. He criticised Kabete MP Ferdinand Waititu for accusing the Jubilee administration of underperforming. The country has achieved a lot in development under Jubilee rule, Kabogo said.&ldquo;We would rather abandon construction of roads and empower people to be economically &mdash; and later construct roads through the taxes they will pay once they reap from their businesses,&rdquo; he said . Kabogo told his rivals to be ready to lose on August 8, saying he will give them a run for their money. He said he has the experience to continue turning the county around and transform residents&rsquo; lives.
