Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero has exuded confidence that he will beat Jubilee candidate Mike Sonko in the August 8 polls.Sonko trounced his fierce rival Peter Kenneth in the Jubilee primaries on Thursday and will now face Kidero in the general elections.He garnered 138,185 votes against Kenneth&rsquo;s 62,504.Former Starehe MP Margaret Wanjiru, who was also in the race for the Jubilee ticket, got 7,654 votes.&ldquo;I am not surprised. All along we knew Sonko was going to be our competitor. So we are not worried and Nairobians will prove that in August,&rdquo; he said on phone on Friday.The governor said that the city residents will re-elect him because of his development record.&ldquo;Our level of preparedness is not determined by who our competitor is. It is determined by the urban integrated development plan that we have developed,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;It is based on Human Resource management plans that we have put in place and Solid waste management plan that we have developed with JICA,&rdquo; said the city boss.Kidero got a direct ticket from ODM to defend his seat. ODM leader Raila Odinga&rsquo;s former aide Miguna Miguna is also in the race for the city governor seat and will run as an independent candidate.Kidero has been criticised by a section of the residents and competitors of failing to deliver the pledges he made to the city dwellers in 2013.They have cited traffic jam, dirty city, hawkers menace and streets families who have flooded the CBD as some of the areas he has failed to address.But the governor has maintained that he has initiated many development projects and his competitions of peddling lies about his record to oust him.He says that he inherited a City without a plan and was full of cartels that sabotage and frustrate service delivery to the residents.Read: Kidero tells off rivals, says he has many ongoing projects
