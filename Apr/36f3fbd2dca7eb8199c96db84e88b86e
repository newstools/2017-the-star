The Kenya Electrical Trades and Allied Workers Union has threatened to issue a seven-day strike notice if Kenya Power continues to derail the registration and implementation of the collective bargaining agreement signed on January 27.Kenya Power moved to court to stop the registration of the CBA allegedly signed by both parties from the union and the parastatal.In their affidavit, Kenya Power says it will suffer a substantial loss if the court orders implementation of a flawed CBA. &ldquo;That implementation will involve unlawful expenditure of millions of shillings of public funds and will be irrecoverable. It may pose a challenge which is likely to lead to disconnect amongst the union staff, thereby leading to strikes and paralysis of the company.&rdquo;The electricity supplying firm also says the CBA will benefit some staff and leave out employees in the management positions. It said such a situation will cause disharmony and create disaffection amongst workers, which might trigger a go slow. However, in an affidavit signed by Ketawu deputy secretary general Kosgey Kolil, Kenya Power had appeared before Justice Hellen Wasilwa on February 27 and agreed to register the CBA.He further states the CBA was duly signed by the union officials and Kenya Power on January 27 this year after lengthy negotiations.&ldquo;Kenya Power and the union have already signed the CBA yet they are now purporting to disown the process by claiming that exhaustive consultations have not been made,&rdquo; Kolil says.The Ketawu deputy secretary general also said their employer&rsquo;s decision to challenge the CBA in court was in bad faith. He said Kenya Power filed the case through concealed facts and non-disclosure, alleging the Salaries and Remuneration Commission was not consulted in the matter, and that it did not give express direction to register the CBA.Kolil further states the SRC has no jurisdiction, authority or power to advise Kenya Power on the CBA, since the company is not a state corporation or a public service office.&ldquo;In the alternative and without prejudice, KPLC ought to have sought the advice of the SRC prior to the commencement of the collective bargaining process with the union that culminated in the signing of the CBA,&rdquo; Kolil says.Justice Monica Mbaru yesterday declined to stay the orders to stop the registration of the CBA, and said the matter will be heard on May 10.
