Prominent ODM leaders, including its deputy party leader Hassan Joho, will today face the party&rsquo;s Disciplinary committee over violence that is threatening to scuttle its primaries.The party&rsquo;s rapid-response entity, known as the Central Committee, chaired by Raila Odinga, on Friday summoned 14 leaders.It&rsquo;s feared violence may puncture Raila&rsquo;s presidential bid and trigger voter apathy in NASA strongholds.Others summoned are Migori Governor Okoth Obado, Senators James Orengo, Anyang&rsquo; Nyong&rsquo;o, Suna East MP Junet Mohamed, former MPs John Pesa, Ochillo Ayacko and Migori ODM chairman Philip Mc&rsquo;Abong&rsquo;o.This follows the chaos that rocked a rally in Migori in which Joho&rsquo;s bodyguard was shot.The incident has split key Raila allies, with some faulting Nyong&rsquo;o and his brigade for openly endorsing some candidates just days before party primaries, despite the party leader advocating neutrality.It is said that some officials at Raila&rsquo;s Capital Hill offices drafted a fictitious statement allegedly from Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya in support of an embattled Obado.Oparanya disowned the statement.Also summoned today in a separate incident is Ruaraka MP TJ Kajwang&rsquo; and her arch rival, nominated Senator Elizabeth Ongoro. Ongoro, accompanied by tens of supporters, stormed Orange House, roughed up party executive director Oduor Ong&rsquo;wen and wrestled him to the ground.From Mathare, lawyer Anthony Oluoch and MCA Peter Owera have been summoned.
