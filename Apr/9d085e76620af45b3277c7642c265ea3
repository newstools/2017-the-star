Raila Odinga is the silver bullet that will deliver victory to NASA, Wiper secretary general Hassan Omar has said.NASA recently named Raila Odinga its presidential flag bearer, with Kalonzo Musyoka as his running mate.Musalia Mudavadi will be Premier Cabinet Secretary deputised by Moses Wetang'ula and Isaac Rutto.Rutto will be in charge of the State Department of Devolution and Planning, while Wetang'ula will be in charge of Public Service.The positions will be created in the event of NASA victory on August 8, and after a constitutional referendum.Read: How Wetangula, Rutto made Raila the Nasa flagbearerOmar said the Opposition outfit was right to choose Raila, quashing claims that Wiper will pull out of the coalition."You guys have heard of the silver bullet. Contrary to perceptions, this is not a question of somebody&rsquo;s last bullet per se. It is about a silver bullet that will deliver victory for the people of Kenya," he said on Sunday.Wiper's Francis Nyenze had criticised the NASA lineup, saying it was a raw deal for the Kamba community."In my own opinion the Kamba nation got a raw deal and we do not want anybody to take Kamba's for a ride," Nyenze said.Nyenze said "new people" were brought into the coalition to circumvent the whole process."It would be a very difficult task to convince the Kamba nation to be the second fiddle in 2017," he said.[VIDEO] NASA line up raw deal for Kambas, we will not play second fiddle - NyenzeBut Omar said Nyenze should pull together with the rest of the party to support Raila.He said although Wiper wanted Kalonzo Musyoka to be NASA flag bearer, they are still committed to the chosen candidate,"In my opinion, the fact that it was not Kalonzo only behooves us to put truth to our public assertions that we will support whoever is made the flag bearer," he said.He said NASA parties should not be like Jubilee, which mobilises its supporters around 'Raila-phobia'.&ldquo;It will either accuse Raila of ICC machinations, or accuse Raila of hatred, or violence. We must not play into the propaganda of the Jubilee regime,&rdquo; said Omar.Nyenze last Friday claimed that the committee tasked with selecting the NASA flag-bearer had selected Kalonzo up to the last minute."I was in the team and up to the last minute, Kalonzo was the flag bearer. How it changed we still do not know. We were all taken aback," he said.Nyenze said the Wiper party leader should talk to them before they take any other action."We need to talk and decide on a way forward. We cannot assume that our people will follow the instructions.They have to know why they should vote for NASA." he said. "If I don't fight for the Kamba nation who will?"
