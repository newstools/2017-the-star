State House spokesman Manoah Esipisu yesterday said Cabinet Secretaries and others senior civil servants are justified in attending Jubilee campaign meetings.They are accountable to the President as the appointing authority and his government.However, he said although the top civil servants appear to be campaigning for the President and jubilee, in actual sense they do not campaign. They merely describe investments made by the government and benefits to Kenyans, he said at State Lodge, Eldoret.Esipisu said the senior civil servants have a responsibility to account for what they do for the government and the people of Kenya. &ldquo;They have to account for the progress the administration of Uhuru since taking office, and they have to account for the confidence invested in them by the Kenyan people,&rdquo; Esipisu said.He said they have a duty to operationalise the President&rsquo;s vision in service delivery to Kenyans.Esipisu identified government projects taking place in Uasin Gishu and adjacent areas, saying while the county government has so far received more than Sh15 billion, CDF kitties have received Sh2.23 billion.He listed hospitals expanded by the government in the region and other infrastructure projects that are currently under development. &ldquo;At the right time they must also be asked to account for how they invested the money regarding projects undertaken,&rdquo; Esipisu said.He dismissed claims that some Jubilee development programmes were skewed to benefit some regions and sideline others.Esipisu singled out the Last Mile Connectivity projects which he said are helping all Kenyans, including opposition strongholds of Western and Nyanza.Esipisu said Homa Bay, Siaya, Kisumu, Bungoma, Kitui, Makueni and Machakos, and other counties in Western, Nyanza and Eastern are among those that had extensively benefitted from the electrification programmes.&ldquo;The myth that there are parts of this country which benefit more than others is not real. The government, as the hand that gives, has been fair to all Kenyans in all regions,&rdquo; he said.Esipisu said Seychelles President Danny Faure arrives in the country today for a state visit.Faure will be welcomed by President Uhuru Kenyatta at State House.The visit will begin with a 21&ndash;gun salute, a tete&ndash;a&ndash;tete meeting with Uhuru.Esipisu said the two leaders will hold a bilateral meeting, followed by a State Luncheon in honour Faure.&ldquo;Kenya and Seychelles share warm and cordial bilateral relations. Areas of interest between both countries include Maritime Security,&rdquo; he said.He said the cooperation will be enhanced through other initiatives such as sharing of intelligence and capacity building measures. &ldquo;Tourism is a major foreign exchange earner for Kenya and Seychelles and the two countries share similar product - beach tourism,&rdquo; he said.Esipisu said there are opportunities of cooperation in this sector between the two countries. These include sharing of best practices, training and exchange programmes, joint marketing strategies and joint packaging of the destinations.He also said Kenya stands to benefit by encouraging qualified Kenyans to seek employment in Seychelles. &ldquo;Seychelles requires well-trained and skilled human capital for employment in various sectors of their economy,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;This will not only have an impact on the economies of the two countries but will also increase the linkages between Kenya and Seychelles.&rdquo;
