Kenya has started offering tax incentives to clothing companies, a key part of its under-performing manufacturing sector, to create jobs and provide affordable new clothes for shoppers.Executives in the textiles industry said the changes included allowing them to sell 20 per cent of their annual production locally without sales taxes and without paying import duties on the materials and equipment used to produce the garments.The advent of cheap, second-hand clothes imports from the US and Europe, locally known as mitumba, in the 1980s, put local apparel firms out of business and killed production of raw materials like cotton. &ldquo;The manufacturing sector is still facing some challenges in regards to cheap imports and the counterfeit goods,&rdquo; Devolution and Planning CS Mwangi Kiunjuri said. He said they were dealing with the difficulties by implementing new policies to encourage firms to boost production and hire more people.The government has been paying more attention to the sector in recent years, offering cheaper electricity to textile firms in export processing zones.The removal of sales taxes at a recent local sale resulted in thousands of consumers standing patiently in long lines for a chance to buy garments, which are normally exclusively exported to European and American retail chains.Kenya has the highest rate of youth joblessness in East Africa, the World Bank said, with 17 per cent of all young people eligible for work lacking jobs. Neighbouring Tanzania and Uganda have comparable rates of 5.5 and 6.8 per cent, respectively.Formal manufacturing accounted for nine per cent of Kenya&rsquo;s $70 billion (Sh7.24 trillion) economic output last year, but it employed just 0.3 million people out of 45 million, official data showed this week.
