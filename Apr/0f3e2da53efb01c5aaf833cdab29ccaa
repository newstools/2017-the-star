Deputy President William Ruto yesterday continued to take charge of the Jubilee primaries at the party headquarters in Nairobi.The place is under heavy security. Journalists and aspirants accessing the offices were thoroughly screened by police officers. Yesterday, JP National Elections Board chairman Andrew Musangi announced the postponing of Mt Elgon primaries to today.He said primaries will also be conducted in Nairobi, Murang'a, Marsabit and Turkana counties.Nominations for Nairobi were to be conducted on Monday. It was reported that the postponement was to allow a consensus between Senator Mike Sonko and former Gatanga MP Peter Kenneth on who should fly the JP ticket for Nairobi governor.In Murang'a, Governor Mwangi Wairia will also face off with Kigumo MP Jamleck Kamau for the top county seat.For Mt Elgon, Musangi said hitches, including delays in dispatching elections materials, led to the postponement of the primaries."We had few hiccups here and there. The majority of them have been resolved through consensus between aspirants and our officials on the ground," Musangi told the press at JP headquarters at Pangani Junction, Nairobi."Taking into account the size of Mt Elgon constituency and the vast distances between the polling stations, we consulted the aspirants and unanimously agreed to conduct the voting early in the morning."Musangi also announced that Kones Beatrice (Bomet East), Kosgei Kipkoech (Sotik), Daniel Kipkosgei (Keiyo South) and Kipsang'a Kipkemboi (Marakwet West) clinched the JP parliamentary tickets for their respective constituencies in the Rift Valley.He said NEB will only announce winners at the headquarters after verifying the results.Musangi said officials on the ground are ensuring results from polling centres are credible and accepted by the aspirants' agents before forwarding to the constituency tallying centres.He condemned aspirants, including Kirinyaga Governor Joseph Ndathi for criticising the credibility of the exercise before the final tallying.
