Political parties participating in the August election yesterday declined to sign the code of conduct prepared by the electoral agency.Top officials of parties that met with the commission in Nairobi cited the short notice they were given, saying they should be given time to read and consult with their National Executive councils.In the stormy meeting, the officials claimed that the code of conduct they were to sign had many inconsistencies compared to the one contained in Schedule Two of the Elections Act.ODM secretary general Agnes Zani kicked off the storm, when she demanded that the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission should also signed a binding code of conduct with the political parties.Zani, a nominated senator, said it does not make sense for the commission to demand high standards when it cannot commit to best practices in conducting elections.&ldquo;It takes two to tango. The IEBC should also give their side of the code of conduct that will bind them to the best practices and the laws,&rdquo; she said, joining forces with the participants to shelve the signing of the code of conduct.The officials also took issue with a clause in the code of conduct which said that the person signing the document will be held responsible in case a member or party engages in electoral malpractices, including violence. After it clearly emerged that the officials would not sign the document, IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati told officials to go and extract the code of conduct in the Elections Act and submit it today.He said all parties participating in the election must sign it.&ldquo;Failure to sign the code of conduct, there are consequences,&rdquo; Chebukati said, amid murmurs from the participants.At the same function, Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet warned politicians against breaking the law and inciting violence.He said they will be arrested.The police boss said security has been beefed up ahead of the August 8 general election and during party primaries that begin today.&ldquo;My officers are very ready. I want to assure you and members of the public that we will apply the law equally without fear or favour. If you doubt us, break the law,&rdquo; he said.
