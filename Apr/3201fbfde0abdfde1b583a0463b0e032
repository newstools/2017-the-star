Mandera Governor Ali Roba has said the Jubilee Party still dominates in the county, despite defections by some leaders.This comes after candidates picked by the Garre Council of Elders in a negotiated democracy deal defected from the party to form their own Economic Freedom Party.The EFP has the blessings of elders. Some leaders who have joined EFP are Senator Billow Kerrow, MPs Mohamed Huka (Mandera South), Fathia Mahbub (woman representative), nominated MP Hassan Osman and Deputy Governor Omar Mohammed.The party was launched in March. It will challenge Roba and other Jubilee leaders, including MPs Mohamed Haji (Banisa), Shaban Issack (Lafey), Mohamud Mohamed (Mandera West) and Adan Mohamed Nooru (Mandera North).Speaking to the Star, Roba expressed hope and confidence the Jubilee Party will still dominate in the August general election.&ldquo;Mandera is still very much painted red with the Jubilee Party and I am positive it will scoop more votes in 2017 than it did in 2013. The elders&rsquo; line-up was afraid of going for the nomination, opting to be given direct nominations. Clearly they sensed defeat,&rdquo; he said.In 2013, some 94,433 ( 93 per cent) voted for President Uhuru Kenyatta (Jubilee) and 4,366 ( 4 per cent ) voted for Cord&rsquo;s Raila Odinga.Leaders endorsed by the elders defected in March, saying they doubted JP nominations would be credible.The region, which has a population of 1,025,756 according to the 2009 Census, registered 120,768 voters biometrically in 2013.Roba said the merging of 13 affiliate parties to form the Jubilee Party has made it stronger and will prevent the splitting of votes.In 2013, MCAs elected on William Ruto&rsquo;s URP were 23, TNA had three, Safina had two, and the National Vision Party had one. The governor, senator, woman representative and all six MPs were elected on the URP ticket.
