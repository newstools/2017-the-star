Banking and Saccos regulators on Friday warned the public against falling prey to re-emerging pyramid schemes ahead of expensive political campaigns for the August 8 general elections.The Central Bank of Kenya and the Sacco Societies Regulatory Authority said unlicensed deposit-taking companies and Ponzi schemes were springing up. The schemes, which have traditionally emerged in the run-up to general elections perhaps to raise funds for campaigns, usually lure the unsuspecting investors with promise of super-high returns on investments after a short time.&ldquo;Such entities usually entice members of the public to place money with them and promise quick and abnormally high returns on their money or acquisition of non-existent properties,&rdquo; the two regulators said in a joint statement. &ldquo;CBK and Sasra advise members of the public not to place their money with unlicensed entities.&rdquo;The warning was issued in a week media reports indicated that about 7,000 unsuspecting investors may have been conned of more than Sh3 billion in an alleged fraudulent housing scheme run by Ekeza Sacco.Investors in the Ekeza Sacco, chaired by Kiambu gubernatorial aspirant David Ngari, allegedly made minimum deposits of Sh10,000 each as booking fee for the houses, The Standard reported on Tuesday. They have been topping up with savings since the scheme launched aggressive marketing campaigns in January 2016, it has been reported.Pyramid schemes are, however, not new in Kenya. In the run up to the closely-contested 2007 presidential poll, at least 148,784 investors lost in the upwards of Sh8 billion to the schemes, according to a report of the Taskforce on Pyramid Scheme released on June 24, 2009.The task-force, chaired by legislator Francis Nyenze (now minority leader in the National Assembly), however, warned the amount and investors involved could be way higher as the committee lacked funds and time to extensively complete the probe.The biggest of them were Deci, Global Entrepreneurship, Mont Blanc Afrique, Pesanet Ltd and Acid.The CBK and Sasra asked the public to &ldquo;exercise caution and ensure they place their funds with credible and duly licensed deposit-taking institutions&rdquo;. There are 13 deposit-taking microfinanciers licensed by the CBK under the Microfinance Act,(Deposit-Taking Microfinance Institutions) regulations, 2008 while Sasra licenses deposit-taking Saccos under the Sacco Societies Act, 2008.&ldquo;There are, however, other co-operative societies registered by the Commissioner of Co-operative Development to mobilise savings from their members, and also provide credit facilities against the collateral of such savings,&rdquo; the two regulators said. They institutions, registered under the Co-operative Societies Act are, however, &ldquo;not authorised to take withdrawable deposits&rdquo;.
