Kenya&rsquo;s GDP growth is projected to decelerate to 5.5 per cent, a 0.5 percentage point mark down from the 2016 forecast, the World Bank has said.&ldquo;Kenya is currently facing headwinds that are likely to dampen GDP growth in 2017," the bank said in the Kenya Economic Update report on Wednesday.World Bank Country Director for Kenya Diarietou Gaye said the dampening of the GDP was due to the ongoing drought that has led to crop failure, dying herds of livestock, and increased food insecurity.The government declared a national disaster the drought that has affected 23 arid and semi-arid counties and pockets of other areas.President Uhuru Kenyatta asked all local and international stakeholders to support the government by up-scaling drought mitigation programmes.More on this: Kenya declares drought national disaster, asks for help"With hydropower being the cheapest source of energy in Kenya, poor rains increase energy costs, their effects spilling over to other sectors," Gaye said.Gaye said the rise of in food and energy prices drove inflation to a five-year high of 10.3 per cent in March."Kenya faces a marked slowdown in credit growth to the private sector. At 4.3 per cent, this remains well below the ten-year average of 19 per cent and is weighing on private investment and household consumption," he said.Gaye said as a net oil importer, the rise in global oil prices compared to the lows of 2016 has a dampening effect on economic activity. "However, in the medium term, economic growth is projected to rebound to 5.8 per cent in 2018 and 6.1 per cent in 2019, consistent with Kenya&rsquo;s underlying growth potential," he said.But he noted that Kenya&rsquo;s economy remains vulnerable to downside risks. These, he said includes potential for fiscal slippages, a more prolonged drought in 2017, and external risks from a weaker than expected growth amongst Kenya&rsquo;s trading partners.Solutions and recommendationsAllen Dennis, senior economist of the KEU, said prudent macroeconomic policies will help safeguard Kenya&rsquo;s robust economic performance, in particular fiscal consolidation consistent with the Medium Term Fiscal Framework. &ldquo;Fiscal consolidation needs to be implemented in such a way so as not to compromise the development spending needed to unlock the country&rsquo;s productive capacity," he said. "This will require adjustments on recurrent spending and improvements on domestic resource mobilisation."The report recommended that credit access can be supported by reducing public sector borrowing, and the transactions cost for accessing credit through better credit reporting."[T]he creation of a central electronic collateral registry, and a framework to promote property as collateral with the automation of land registries and the implementation of the National Payments System Act," the report read.It also recommended that agricultural productivity can also be improved by increasing the competitiveness of agricultural input and output markets. "New engines for economic growth need to be supported, such as unlocking the affordable housing market," it read.But it noted that the special focus of the 15th edition of the KEU advocates the development of the housing finance market that will present new avenues of income through the construction sector and other related industries.&ldquo;Kenya can make housing more affordable to many more Kenyans, which will in turn create new channels to boost overall economic growth both at the national and county levels,&rdquo; Lead Financial Sector Specialist Mehnaz Safavian said.&ldquo;With an urbanisation rate of 4.4 per cent and 61 per cent of urban households living in slums, the provision of housing finance and new housing finance products can help unlock the housing market to address the pressing need for affordable dwellings."The KEU report was prepared by the World Bank Group in consultation with the Kenya Economic Roundtable.Read: World Bank upholds Kenya&rsquo;s 2017 growth outlook at 6%Also read: World Bank trims Kenya's 2015-16 growth forecast over weakening shilling
