Four directors of Malili Ranch Ltd yesterday were charged afresh with the theft of Sh553 million from the shareholders of the land-buying company.They are David Ndolo Ngilai, James Kituku Munguti, Julius Mbau Nzyuko and Leonard Kyania Kitua. They denied six counts of conspiracy to defraud, stealing and breach of trust before senior principal magistrate Lawrence Mugambi at the Milimani Anti-Corruption Court. He ordered each to remain free on their previous Sh1.5 million bail.Meanwhile the DPP has withdrawn the criminal case against senior government officers and Machakos Senator Johnson Muthama. They had been charged with the fraudulent acquisition of the 5,000-acres Malili Ranch for construction of Konza Techno City at Makueni county for Sh1 billion.Those discharged are former Information PS Bitange Ndemo, a member of the NPSC Ronald Musengi, former commissioner of lands Zablon Mabeya and a former ranch director Julius Maweu Kilonzo.The five had filed various constitutional references at the High Court seeking to have the charges cleared. Senior assistant DPP Victor Mule, Daniel Karuri, Warui Mungai and Lilian Obuor told the court the state opted to proceed with the case against the four following fresh investigations. Mungai told the magistrate the case has been pending in court for awhile and that the prosecution is ready to proceed.But defence lawyers said, "the state has filed fresh charges against the accused persons and they need time to study the fresh evidence and get proper instructions."The four are accused of conspiring to defraud Malili Ranch by fraudulently causing the sale of 5,000 acres for Sh1 billion to the government between February 2, 2009 and January 11, 2010.The hearing will be on June 19.
