The National Drought Management Authority branch in Lamu county has distributed 330 tonnes of animal feed to pastoralists in the areas hard-hit by the prolonged dry spell.The Sh17 million animal feed was funded by the European Union.The aid is one of the NDMA&rsquo;s initiatives to mitigate drought in the county.Speaking in Lamu town on Monday, county NDMA coordinator Mohamed Dahir said the nutritionally balanced animal feeds included ranch cubes and multi-nutrient feed blocks.The donation is meant to &ldquo;mitigate further deaths of livestock and ensure regeneration of the herds. More than 20,000 head of cattle have already benefitted through this initiative in the whole of Lamu county,&rdquo; he said. Grazing land has become scarce, especially after herders from Tana River, Wajir and Garissa counties invaded the traditional grazing areas in Lamu, causing tension.The NDMA estimates that 70,000 families and 300,000 livestock are facing starvation.Early last month, NDMA and the national government launched a destocking programme where more than 1,000 livestock were bought and slaughtered, and the meat distributed to residents.The initiative was meant to reduce pressure on pasture lands and water resources, and reduce the number of livestock dying of hunger.
