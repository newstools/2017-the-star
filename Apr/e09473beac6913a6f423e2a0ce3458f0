Give us the money to pay doctors for the 100 days they were on strike, the governors have told the national government.Last week the President ordered the doctors paid as agreed in a return-to-work formula.Council of Governors chairman Peter Munya yesterday said the counties do not have money to pay doctors for the three months they boycotted work.&ldquo;The money that we would have paid the doctors was used to buy medicine and support faith-based institutions in the counties. We do not have extra money to pay the doctors as soon as possible,&rdquo; he said.Munya said the national government had promised to help the counties pay the doctors.&ldquo;We seek the government to meet its promise because we have not refused to pay the doctors. All we need is for the national government to dispatch the money and we will pay them,&rdquo; he said.Munya was addressing journalists in Nairobi.The doctors went on strike on December 5, demanding a 300 per cent pay rise. Last week President Uhuru Kenyatta warned them against going on strike, and said they would be sacked if they do. The doctors had threatened to boycott work if counties refuse to pay them for not working.
