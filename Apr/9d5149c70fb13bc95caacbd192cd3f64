A fresh bid failed yesterday to stop the electoral agency from awarding a tender to auditor KPMG for review and clean-up of the flawed voters&rsquo; register.Justice Chacha Mwita refused to temporarily bar the IEBC from entering into any contract with the audit firm. Instead, he directed the file placed before justice Roselyn Aburili on Wednesday.In early February the IEBC said there were 78,752 anomalies in the register. On January 24, the IEBC said there were 128,000 cases of double registrations.Kenya has 15.85 million registered voters.An independent outside audit is intended to help clean up the mess. The opposition says a crooked register will be used to rig the polls. It says KPMG is not the best qualified and experienced to conduct a scrupulous electoral audit.KPMG, a recognised business auditor, was chosen over 11 other bidder.Last Thursday Mwita dismissed on a technicality a similar suit filed by Cord.The new case was filed by activist Okiya Omtatah who says the decision to contract KPMG to scrutinise the register ahead of the August 8 polls is discriminatory and arbitrary.He says proper procedures were not followed, so the award should be cancelled.Through lawyer Apollo Mboya, Omtatah says no technical committee was set up prior to the start of the audit.This is despite the law requiring that one must be in place after being approved by Parliament. &ldquo;Claims by the commission it consulted Political Parties Liaison committee before issuing the tender is mischievous and only intended to circumvent the requirement to form a technical committee,&rdquo; he said.
