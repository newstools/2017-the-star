The view over the wonderfully green eland valley beneath me was stunning. After much rain in the past month, the grass is growing thick and lush. In the distance, the shape of hundreds of large black dots was visible. I could see they were buffalo, so I drove to where they were. They were really having a feast or a &ldquo;bovine fine dine&rdquo;, so to speak. With so much grass in the park, they will have plenty of fresh pasture for many months, plus abundant water in the dams. Buffalo have a strong social instinct and often form large herds. Currently, I believe that the largest herd in the park is well over 500 buffalo, maybe 600?It is noted that the large zebra herds and wildebeest have started moving out of the park, but buffalo do not appear to move out . Over the years, I have observed that it is during this period that the lions will actively hunt buffalo more than during the dry season. The park now has a lion population of approximately 30, with quite a few large male lions.About seven years ago, I witnessed a very unusual event. As some lions were eating a buffalo carcass on the edge of the Eland dam, a group a three hippos actually chased the lions off the kill and even licked the carcass. Perhaps they benefited from the nutrients?The buffalo in the Nairobi park continue to thrive, while enjoying the lush grasses, but still are ever watchful for lions. Next time you are in the park and you see a herd of buffalo close by, it is good to just switch off your vehicle and relax while watching them.The park is open daily from 06h00 to 19h00.For more information on the park you can link to the following websites www.kws.org or www.nairobigreenline.com or on Facebook &ndash; Nairobi National Park
