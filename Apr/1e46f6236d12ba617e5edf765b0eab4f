REPORTS from certain unverified sources carried by some sections of media purporting that NASA has reached a decision on the position of flagbearer are erroneous.Our members in the National Coordinating Committee and technical committee are unaware of any decision having been made by the NCC or the technical committee on the flagbearer.We are however aware of many working documents and proposals under discussion in the two committees.Kenyans should ignore such misleading information and remain steadfast on efforts to unite in NASA. We therefore encourage that anchor parties to the NASA coalition must refrain from conduct that undermines unity.As a party, we are happy to announce that, towards validating our mutually agreed competitive and democratic process to unveil the NASA Presidential candidate, on Wednesday evening we presented to the IEBC the Honourable Wycliffe Musalia Mudavadi as the party&rsquo;s Presidential aspirant alongside other aspirants for various seats across the country.By officially lodging his name with the IEBC, we were complying with the critical election timeline that required parties to submit the names of their aspirants at all levels by April 5, 2017, ahead of the NASA Presidential nominations. We were at the same time underlining the often-stated fact that any of the four principals has an equal chance of being chosen as the flagbearer and hence the respective parties must prepare their candidates.Obviously, from our corner of the coalition, we strongly vouch for our party leader to be picked to carry the NASA flag into the Presidential contest. We know our partners are democratically lobbying for their principals too; but we have all agreed to back the final mutually agreed line-up, to the last man, to ensure a resounding victory.We urge ANC supporters to be on the lookout and totally reject opportunistic propaganda and mischievous lies thrown around through mainstream media, social media and other means of communication, to dishearten, divide and disorganize us. We equally appeal for calm among NASA supporters.As a major stakeholder, being the originators of NASA, we have demanded, and have firm assurance, that all preelection power agreements being negotiated alongside the identification of the NASA Presidential candidate should ensure the inclusivity of all the principals, the partner parties and also ethnic, religious groups and the gender balance required to rally the majority of Kenyans together to usher in a new people-driven government.Osotsi is ANC secretary general
