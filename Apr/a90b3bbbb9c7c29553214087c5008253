The Institute of Economic Affairs has recommended a freeze on creation of new parastatals and a probe on existing ones in order to free up funds for development.&ldquo;What we are saying is that as a way of managing our expenditure we need to curb establishment of parastatals, we need to get into the data bases of parastatals and ask ourselves which ones are not delivering and find out which ones are commercially viable,&rdquo; IEA Kenya senior economist John Mutua said yesterday. The Institute has noted that more parastatals are still being created, with majority politically influenced, to create employment for family and friends. President Uhuru Kenyatta created a parastatal reform taskforce on July 23, 2015, to spearhead reforms in state corporations, in a bid to curb wastage of public funds and enhance productivity.The taskforce recommended the reduction of state corporations from 262 to 187 at an estimated cost of Sh600 million. It also recommended for mergers of entities with similar roles.&ldquo;What we realised from the budget is about 20 per cent of the national government budget goes as transfers to parastatals. A substantial part of the money going into these parastatals is going into travels and salaries,&rdquo; Mutua said.The Government Owned Entities Bill 2015 which guides the merging plans was expected to be enacted in September 2015. It is however yet to be tabled in the National Assembly for debate.The bill proposes the establishment of a state investment company for commercial entities and establishment of a National and County Agencies Oversight Office for government agencies.If passed, state corporations and government owned entities will be reclassified under six key areas.They include commercial and strategic, regulators, promotion and development agencies, training and research institutions, service institutions and funding agencies&ldquo;If we have a parastatal generating money based on the services it provides then the government can reduce the amount of money it is sending to that parastatal,&rdquo; Mutua said, &ldquo;There are a number of measures that can be taken towards reducing the portion of budget being transferred to parastatals.&rdquo; The government plans to spend Sh1.347 trillion on recurrent expenditure and Sh640.3 billion on development in 2017/18.
