Tensions and temperatures are rising countrywide as primaries get underway. In Busia, for example, antagonism between the Luhya and Teso communities is mounting by the day after ODM cancelled results for the governor ticket.Police were posted at most polling stations in the county and were proactive throughout the tense exercise last week. They moved in when necessary. They should do the same everywhere across the country by protecting all aspirants, supporters, electoral materials and property &mdash; and by ensuring supporters don't clash.The police should also ensure law and order is maintained at rallies and other political meetings where crowds can get unruly. And they must swiftly investigate crimes during nominations.Success of election security depends upon the political neutrality and professionalism of security personnel. They should do their job without fear or favour of any contestant or party.Police professionalism is demonstrated by the quality of its institutional organisation, management and resources, as well as the training and discipline of its officers.
