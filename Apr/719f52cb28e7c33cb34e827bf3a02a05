Kenyans should vote only for leaders who understand their needs and are able to help improve their socio-economic standards, and not for tribe or what the leaders offer during campaigns, a Tana River aspirant has said.&ldquo;Tribes should be able to identify us, but not [be used as] a vehicle to ascend to political seats. This is where we have gone wrong as a country. We are paying the price of electing bad leaders,&rdquo; Sala MCA aspirant Mahamud Barrow said.He said Tana River has lagged behind because of bad leaders and not a lack of resources.Barrow spoke at Mororo on Monday.He will run on the Narc Kenya ticket.Barrow said good leaders can fix the problems in Sala ward and Tana River county.
