Agriculture CS Willy Bett and his Water counterpart Eugene Wamalwa on Monday were taken to task to explain the government&rsquo;s lack of preparation to handle the drought.Experts at the first Leadership Forum at the University of Nairobi poked holes in the government&rsquo;s response, especially as there was plenty of advance warning.The duo sat pensively as participants rated government efforts &ldquo;not effective enough&rdquo;.Only on February 10 did President Uhuru Kenyatta declare drought a national emergency.Three million people need emergency food and other aid. Twenty-three counties are affected. Livestock are dying and people face starvation.Bett said each drought cycle comes with intensity that cannot be measured.&ldquo;We need to accept climate change is with us. Early warning indicators were that there was going to be drought, but it was difficult to determine,&rdquo; he said.Wamalwa said, &ldquo;Climate change is too serious to be left to state actors alone.&rdquo;He urged the academia and non-governmental organisations to join the government to resolve food insecurity. Kenya has begun to focus on irrigation to supplement rain-fed agriculture, he said.The forum was convened to promote dialogue on Food Security and Water.The Kenya Meteorological department in October last year warned most parts of the country would be warm and dry. Long rains are expected to be inadequate.Senior lecturer and head of Horticulture at the University of Nairobi Jane Ambuko said the drought cycle is predictable, hence, better planning possible.&ldquo;We need to plan better. Mitigation against drought has technologies that other countries have used,&rdquo; she said, citing Israel as one of the countries from which Kenya should learn.Ambuko said with proper planning and better innovation and technology, Kenya can feed itself.Green Africa Foundation chairperson Isaac Kalua said corruption threatens construction of dams.The session was attended by UoN vice chancellor Peter Mbithi, businessman Chris Kirubi, Kenya Red Cross secretary general Abbas Gullet and British High Commissioner Nic Hailey.Gullet appealed to the government for more funding, citing projects initiated after earlier droughts. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s clear the drought will happen in the country every five to six years,&rdquo; he said, adding that cattle raising has become a curse in some counties, as pastoralists are left with nothing to depend on.
