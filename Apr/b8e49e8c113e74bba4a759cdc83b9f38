The Jubilee Party is ready to face and defeat NASA candidates in the election, National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale has said.&ldquo;We as Jubilee government are ready to face them whether they are in a group or as an individual. We are, however, offering them free advice that time is running out and they better put their house in order before its too late,&rdquo; he said.Speaking at Bula college, Garissa county, on Tuesday, he criticised NASA's power-sharing strategy and said that is not the way to lead Kenyans.&ldquo;You can only share the positions which are provided for under the Constitution. We have the position of the President and that of the Deputy President. We also have the position of the speakers, which again is the preserve of the political party which has the largest numbers of Members of Parliament who will again elect the leaders of majority in the house,&rdquo; Duale said.He was referring to a line-up which suggested by the opposition&rsquo;s committee that sees Raila Odinga and Kalonzo Musyoka as the president and running mate candidates, respectively, while Musalia Mudavadi becomes the chief minister and Moses Wetang'ula becomes the speaker of the of National Assembly or Senate.Duale said it is shameful for three communities to share power on behalf of the 42 million Kenyans and questioned what happens to the other 39 tribes.The Garissa Township MP said the Jubilee Party is not worried by the inclusion of Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto in the NASA power-sharing deal.He said he does not add value to NASA and is not a threat to JP."Rutto is a former governor in as far as the jubilee leadership is concerned. He knows a political tsunami is coming his way and come the polling day he will become a former governor," Duale said.He added that more serious candidates than Rutto have been sent packing i the Rift Valley and the governor will also be sent home.
