More than 3,000 ODM members in Msambweni, Kwale county, are protesting against what they termed plans to lock them out of the party nominations on April 19. This came after the number of polling stations was reduced from 28 to five. Some members said they will have to travel more than 60km to a polling station. The ODM members led by Hassan Kassim on Monday said, “The five stations are very far from our villages.We are supposed to walk between 60 and 70km from Msambweni and Ramisi to Kilulu.” He spoke to journalists in Fahamuni. Kassim urged party leader Raila Odinga to intervene and address the issue or forget support from Msambweni. “If ODM fails to handle its affairs and address our issues, we will support other parties. We want all polling stations restored before the nomination day,” he said.
