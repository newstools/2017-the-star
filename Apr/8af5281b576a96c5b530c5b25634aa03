Garissa Township MP hopeful Nassir Dolal has denied rumours on social media that he has stepped down for Farah Maalim.Dolal and Maalim, the Wiper candidate, are from the same clan.There have been claims the ODM top leadership had prevailed on Dolal to support Maalim to consolidate their votes and be in a better position to win.The seat is currently held by National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale, who beat Dolal by a narrow margin in 2013.ODM&rsquo;s failure to give him direct nomination recently only served to further fuel the rumour by his supporters and detractors alike.Speaking to the Star on the phone yesterday, Dolal, fondly known as Jofle by his supporters, said &ldquo;come rain or sunshine my name will on the ballot&rsquo;.He said no frustration or propaganda will make him drop his bid. Dolal said only ODM leader Raila Odinga can prevail upon him to step down.He said even though ODM, and NASA by extension, is the most popular in the area, he is ready to jump ship and run on another ticket.&ldquo;Our resolve remains that after August 8 we have a new MP for Garissa Township. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what formula we shall use,&rdquo; Dolal said.
