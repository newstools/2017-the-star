The National Gender and Equality Commission has commended President Uhuru Kenyatta for directing that the two thirds gender bill be reintroduced in Parliament.Chairperson Winfred Lichuma yesterday said there were two similar bills before the National Assembly and the Senate that had been defeated twice in the respective Houses.&ldquo;Both bills had undergone public participation and the mandatory 90 days had lapsed since their first reading in line with Article 256,&rdquo; Lichuma told journalist in Nairobi yesterday.The Bills are Constitution of Kenya Amendment Bill 2015 (Duale Bill) and the Constitution of Kenya Amendment Bill 2015 (Sijeny Bill).Lichuma said the commission is of the view that because six months have lapsed in case of the Duale Bill and that no division has ever happened for the Sijeny Bill, it is possible under the standing orders to introduce them for another vote on both sides.The commission further advised the speakers of both Houses to establish a mediation committee of members from both Houses to develop a version of the bill that MPs and senators can pass and consider joint sittings to do so in view of the strict timelines.The High Court in March said the National Assembly and the Senate had failed in their joint and separate obligations to enact legislation necessary to ensure not more than two thirds of the members are of the same gender.The court ordered Parliament to take steps to ensure that the required legislation is enacted within 60 days from the date of the order.It further ordered Parliament to report the progress to the Chief Justice. If they fail to enact the said legislation within 60 days, the petitioners or any other person would be at liberty to petition Chief Justice David Maraga to advise the President to dissolve Parliament.
