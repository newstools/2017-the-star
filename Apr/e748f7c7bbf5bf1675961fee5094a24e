The desperately needed maize imported from Mexico may not come as cheap as anticipated.Last month, the state was yet to agree on the price due to logistics. But millers say the maize imports, expected to start arriving next month, will cost between Sh3,700 to Sh4,000 per bag.Agriculture CS Willy Bett last month said the cheapest maize available in the market is from Mexico, hence, the imports should help bring down maize flour prices. Maize imports from Ethiopia sell for Sh4,300.Currently, the price of a two-kilogramme packet of maize flour goes for Sh120 to Sh127. The government released one million bags of maize from the National Cereals and Produce Board and sold them to millers for Sh3,000 a bag.This was intended to stabilise the prices of maize flour, which had hit a high of Sh153 per 2kg packet.According to the Agriculture ministry commodity prices, a 90kg bag of maize sells for Sh4,500 to Sh5,600, while wheat goes for Sh4,650.A 90kg bag of beans is selling at between Sh8,500 and Sh9,200. A 50kg bag of Irish potatoes is selling at an average of Sh3,000. A crate of tomatoes is going for Sh6,700, while a tray of eggs costs Sh316.The Kenya National Bureau of Statistics said in last month&rsquo;s rate and inflation report that year-on-year food inflation stood at 18.56 per cent in March.&ldquo;Between February and March the food and non-alcoholic drinks index increased by 3.18 per cent. This was mainly attributed to increases in prices of several food items, including, spinach, maize flour, milk, potatoes and maize grain. This increase in food prices was partly contributed by prevailing drought conditions,&rdquo; the report said.
