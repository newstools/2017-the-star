Presidential election results announced by the constituency returning officers will be final, a court has ruled, a decision seen aiming to seal loopholes in electoral malpractices.A three-judge bench comprising justices Aggrey Muchelule, Weldon Korir and Chacha Mwita also clipped the powers of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission to audit, vary or confirm presidential results sent from constituencies. &ldquo;IEBC cannot engage in verification of results at national level. This will encroach on powers of electoral court,&rdquo; the three judges said.In their decision, they cited regulations 39 ( 2 ) of the election Act which says the results from constituencies are provisional and subject to confirmation at the national tallying centre.They also nullified regulations 87 ( 2) (c) and 83 ( 2 ) saying they contradict the Constitution.The court said results announced by returning officers at constituencies are final and can only be challenged before a court of law.The decision of the court arose after a case was filed by Maina Kiai and two others seeking to have the results from constituencies.Speaking after the judgment, Prof Ben Sianya, representing Kiai, said the idea of supremacy of national tallying centre does not arise anymore.&ldquo;We are where the Americans are, the Nigerians are and Ghanians. Once the constituency returning officer has announced the results, the media should pick it quickly. You don&rsquo;t need to wait for anybody else to tell you,&rdquo; he said.In their suit papers Kiai, Khelef Khalifa and Tirop Kitur sought interpretation of the laws and regulations that IEBC put in place to guide presidential elections.They said their case is aimed at protecting the integrity of the electoral process, and to secure the sanctity of presidential votes.The three further said the current system is unconstitutional as it undermines the tenets of free and fair election.They say the system renders the declaration of results at constituencies as provisional and not final.The activists said during the 2013 polls, the IEBC treated presidential results announced at constituencies as provisional results.They said provisional results are subject to confirmation by some commissioners and members of staff of the commission in Nairobi.This, they say, exposed the electoral system to abuse, and made it prone to malpractice by the IEBC and its officers.
