Pokot bandits in Baringo and Laikipia counties targeted by an army and police security operation have vowed not to disarm. Instead, they say they will keep raiding, not to pay &lsquo;dowry&rsquo; as in the past but to restock thousands of cattle they say have been stolen or shot dead by security officers during the operation.On April 2, the Pokot bandits said the government should compensate them or else they will stop at nothing until they replace their lost animals.They blamed the loss of their livestock on &ldquo;reckless shooting&rdquo; by police and Kenya Defence Forces soldiers. Other factors cited are harsh droughts and rustling by the neighbouring Ilchamus, Marakwet, Samburu, Tugen and Turkana communities.&ldquo;Cattle rustling is no longer meant for marriage or to pay dowry. Instead we&rsquo;re now out on a mission to reclaim our lost livestock,&rdquo; herder Dodonyang Sawel told the Star at Chemolingot in Tiaty subcounty.He said more than 1,000 heads of cattle belonging to Pokot herders were shot dead last week by security officers, while grazing in ranges in Baringo and Laikipia counties.Herders say the officers took another 5,000 goats and cattle in lorries to unknown destinations. &ldquo;Some were distributed to neighbouring communities to replace livestock they claim were being stolen by Pokot bandits,&rdquo; Sawel said.GRAZING BANHe also accused the government of taking sides by exempting Ilchamus, Marakwet and Tugen communities from the operation.Herder Nepeitole Nabori said: &ldquo;We are now up in arms to reclaim our lost animals.&rdquo;He added that he experienced further losses after the government banned cross-border grazing due to intensive rustling.&ldquo;Since I drove back my 500 animals from Arabal across the border in Baringo South after the government ban, I have lost 300 of them in two weeks,&rdquo; he said.Nabori said 80 of his cattle were also shot dead by KDF soldiers at Komolion, the border of Tiaty and Baringo South, on April 2.He said if the government fails to compensate them, he will not drop his gun even if it means dying with it, until he reclaims his lost animals.He said more than 5,000 animals have also died from lack of water and pasture due to drought, adding that dogs have been left feeding on the carcasses spread all over the bush. Herders, he added, have lost hope of remaining animals surviving following the prolonged drought that began in July last year.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know my fate,&rdquo; Nabori said, adding that his children need school fees and that there are others who depend on him.For three months, the herders were grazing their livestock in areas in Baringo South including Arabal, Rugus, Mukutani, Chebinyiny, Sirata, Komolion, Orus Ng&rsquo;elecha and Noosukro, and areas in Baringo North including Kagir, Yatya, Chemoe, Natan, Kapngetio and Chepkesin.Former Nginyang councilor Yudah Lekwangor said police struck the area on Saturday and swept away more than 3,000 goats belonging to 10 families.Lekwangor said the goats might have been handed to the Tugen residents at Kagir and Yatya in Baringo North, who claim they lost their animals to Pokot bandits last month.He said this happened barely two months after the Pokot herders were evicted from Baringo North and South subcounties, following the ban on cross-border grazing.&ldquo;Pokots are a peaceful people. They only turn violent when provoked,&rdquo; Lekwangor said.He said following civilisation brought forth by Christianity, people in Pokot community no longer accept stolen animals for dowry.&ldquo;As Pokot elders, we normally scrutinise well to ascertain the animals given to pay bride prize is clean and doesn&rsquo;t have any bad history, like being stolen, before we allow a new marriage,&rdquo; he said, adding that the armed bandits were just a few people out to spoil the name of other peaceful Pokot residents. The nomadic Pokot pastoralists are now pondering their next move in the Tiaty subcounty areas of Akwichatis, Ameyan, Chesitet, Churo, Paka, Ripko, Silale and Tangulbei.Contacted for comment, Baringo County Commander of Police Peter Ndung&rsquo;u declined to talk to the media.&ldquo;I know you want to write a story but you know it is operation time and I would not like to comment on anything,&rdquo; he said, adding that he is busy at the moment and could get back to reporters later.Similarly, Baringo North OCPD Ndiema Chemongis and AP commander Robinson Ndiwa referred the Star&rsquo;s calls to Ndung&rsquo;u, saying he was the better placed person to comment.KDF officers could not be reached for comment, although reports say they are stationed at Loruk and are aiding the police and Kenya Police Reservists (KPR) to flush out the bandits, repossess illegal firearms in hands of bandits and restore peace and sanity.POLICE OVERPOWEREDOn Wednesday last week, Churo-Amaya MCA Thomas Minito was linked to the ongoing banditry attacks in Laikipia.His lawyer Kipkemnoi Sirma condemned the government for the &ldquo;reckless&rdquo; arrest of his client, saying he is totally innocent in the attacks going on across western Laikipia.Sirma claimed the arrest is blackmail by the government to hide the atrocities being committed by security officers against the Pokot residents in sides bordering Laikipia, Baringo and Samburu, &ldquo;a thing that we cannot allow to happen&rdquo;.Sirma added that security officers have so far killed over 600 heads of cattle belonging to the Pokot herders to silence and suppress them so they don&rsquo;t express their displeasure.&ldquo;The other day Standard Media Group journalists were arrested, now it is the MCA. Who knows who will fall into the trap next?&rdquo; he said.Then on Friday, suspected armed Pokot bandits attacked Kagir in Baringo North subcounty, driving away 300 goats towards Seretion and Kashokon villages Tiaty Sub-county.Some 40 armed bandits opened fire at 9am, leading to a fierce exchange of fire with the KPR.Resident Richard Chepchoei said the attackers finally overpowered the police reservists before making away with the animals towards the bordering East Pokot (Tiaty).Chepchomei said the attack happened some three kilometers from the Kagir police post but they couldn&rsquo;t shoot, adding that people dispersed upon hearing the gunshots and the bandits had ample time to lead away the goats.HUMANITARIAN CRISISAs the conflict rages, more than 30,000 people displaced by Pokot bandits in Baringo North and South subcounties are facing a dire humanitarian crisis.Some 5,000 children are missing school after 40 schools were closed following the attacks.Rift Valley regional coordinator Wanayama Musiambo assured that peace is back in Baringo and Laikipia counties. He urged those who fled to return to their homes, pick up from where they left off and move on.Residents in Baringo North, including Richard Chepchomei from Chemoe, thanked President Uhuru Kenyatta for deploying KDF to tackle the insecurity, though he said the effect is yet to be felt on the ground.&ldquo;Armed Pokot bandits are still attacking us secretly to steal our animals under the nose of military officers,&rdquo; Chepchomei said, adding that not all bordering areas have been covered by the officers.He called for a massive disarmament operation to confiscate all the illegal firearms in bandits&rsquo; hands to restore peace. On Sunday, elders from the Pokot community called for the security operation to be halted, urging elders from the neighbouring Ilchmaus, Marakwet and Tugen counties to engage in peace talks.Led by Mzee Yudah Losutan, the Pokot elders said more than 10,000 people in Tiaty subcounty are currently facing acute starvation.Speaking to the Star in Chemolingot town, they said the huger situation is getting worse due to the ongoing drought and insecurity.Other Pokot elders present were Musa Amokon, Bishop Richard Kachepko, Micah Kolem, Arch Deacon Canon Chochoi, Bishop Joel Lopeta and former Akoret councillor Omari Kukat.Losutan said the hunger situation now forces residents to eat bitter wild fruits locally known as &lsquo;soruch&rsquo; and slaughter emaciated animals.&ldquo;Residents trek 20km to buy food from shops in Chemolingot and Nginyang centres,&rdquo; Losutan said, adding that children and the elderly are the most vulnerable.The elders said innocent, hunger-stricken Pokots have not known peace since Loyamorok MCA Kibet Cheretei and Tiaty parliamentary aspirant Pepe Kitambaaa were killed on February 18.Losutan also said pastoralists travel several kilometres to access water for domestic use and for their livestock.But earlier, 10 Tugen elders, led by Rev Zachariah Chirchir and Bishop Daniel Chemon, said the security operation should continue.&ldquo;We are strongly opposed to the Pokot elders calling on the government to lift the operation for peace talks,&rdquo; Chirchir said in Kabarnet on March 28.&ldquo;We want to tell them that the time for pleasing one another is over and now the long arm of government should be left to deal with the notorious bandits.&rdquo;They urged the government to resettle over 30,000 people attacked and displaced by Pokot bandits in Baringo North and South and Elgeyo Marakwet county.
