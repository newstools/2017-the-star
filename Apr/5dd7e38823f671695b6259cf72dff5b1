The county government will evict tenants starting next week from its housing over Sh3.8 million rent arrears.Subcounty administration chief officer John Ntoiti said on Friday Woodley, Old and New Ngara estates are targetted. &ldquo;They have not paid for more than one year, despite the low rent,&rdquo; he told journalists at City Hall.The tenants pay Sh8,000 for two and three-bedroom houses. Ntoiti said the amount is far below market rate. Household items will be confiscated. &ldquo;After eviction, you have 24 hours to pay. Otherwise, the house will be rented to another person,&rdquo; he said.City Hall has 17,000 rental houses in several estates, most of them in Eastlands.Meanwhile, the county will also crack down on motorists who don&rsquo;t pay parking. Ntoiti said some motorists, especially PSVs, don&rsquo;t buy seasonal tickets. They are considering clamping government CBD offices over Sh65 billion arrears in rates and parking fees arrears.
