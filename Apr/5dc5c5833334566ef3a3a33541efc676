The government is investigating,&rdquo; he said.Violence erupted during a rally at Posta Grounds in Migori on Monday as supporters of Governor Okoth Obado and rival Ochillo Ayacko clashed. Police and politicians&rsquo; bodyguards shot in the air to disperse crowds.One of Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho&rsquo;s bodyguards was wounded. Kiraithe defended the security agencies for denying politicians&rsquo; permits for rallies. &ldquo;We should not blame police if they think or know an area is not safe. They will advise you not to hold your rally at that time, but this does not mean you will not be able to carry out your rally when it is safe,&rdquo; he said.Kiraithe said the government is working to deploy security personnel in areas prone to violence. &ldquo;We know areas that are prone to violence and police named Migori as one of the areas with security threats during the election period,&rdquo; Kiraithe said.
