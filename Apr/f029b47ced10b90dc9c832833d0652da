Starring: Wentworth Miller, Dominic Purcell, Sarah Wayne Callies, Rockmond Dunbar, Robert Knepper, Amaury NolascoPremier date: April 4If ever there was a show that captured the world&rsquo;s attention, it was Prison Break. This story of two brothers who would go to any end for each other melted our hearts and had us rooting for them to &ndash;literally- get away with murder. Although it seemed producers were trying tie lose ends with the final instalment Prison Break: The Final Break; the show runners have managed to squeeze in one final &lsquo;final&rsquo; break.Prison Break: Resurrection picks up seven years after the death of Michael Scofield. Sara has moved on, Lincoln has fallen into his old ways and somehow the greatest villain on earth T-Bag is out on good behaviour. Michael is incarcerated in a Yemeni prison as he is considered to be a dangerous terrorist. The show reunites the old gang in an attempt to get Michael out of prison. This season promises plenty of action in some real-world parallels (like the war in Yemen) but perhaps most of all we are looking forward to the suitable conclusions for our beloved characters. Star rating: 4.5
