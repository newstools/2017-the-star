The government has launched investigations in public universities following reports that drug cartels are openly operating in the institutions of higher learning.The Education ministry says some drug lords are using students to sell hard drugs in the universities, leading to an increase in cases of unrest.CS Fred Matiang&rsquo;i on Monday said drug peddling in universities is a threat to national security.He cited Maseno University, where such cases have been reported, and called for full investigations.&ldquo;I have directed, through the Commission for University Education, full investigations in such cases especially at Maseno, where cases of students fighting in their hostels are rampant,&rdquo; Matiang&rsquo;i said.He directed vice chancellors of all public universities to institute integrated learning systems that will closely monitor their students.&ldquo;We need to know where they live and the conditions they sleep in and by so doing we will weed out these cartels destroying the future of our innocent children,&rdquo; Matiang&rsquo;i said.The CS spoke during the opening of an induction workshop for newly appointed public university council members at Simba Lodge in Naivasha.Addressing the members, Matiang&rsquo;i said CUE will be strengthened under a programme with the World Bank to improve its regulatory authority.Under the university reforms that are underway, the quality and relevance of degrees being issued will be thoroughly checked, he said.&ldquo;While we work on this comprehensive reform, the journey towards our desired destination of quality and relevant university education must begin in earnest,&rdquo; Matiang&rsquo;i said.&ldquo;Let us now begin on a trajectory of bold and focussed reform that will help transform universities and university education in Kenya to the level we all desire.&rdquo;The CS also urged the council to be vigilant against a new form of litigation brought about by conflicts among leaderships of the institutions.&ldquo;We should be wary of &lsquo;consultant litigation&rsquo; where a vice chancellor wants to make a decision without following due process, but has to hire an activist to go to court or where the senate does the same so as to influence a decision,&rdquo; he said.Matiang&rsquo;i directed the councils of universities that have established campuses out of Kenya, to plan on closing them.&ldquo;We have received complaints from our neighbours of our campuses offering poor quality education and we should agree to close them and focus on reforming them here,&rdquo; he said.
