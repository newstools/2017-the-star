A jealous wife has been arrested after cutting off her husband's private parts - with a pair of scissors.Liezel Betitta, 32, was convinced that husband 'Mark' was having an affair with a friend's wife at a building firm where he worked in Iloilo City, the Philippines.Mark went out drinking with friends after work and fell asleep at a friend's house - before his furious wife stormed round and found him.He woke up in agony after Liezel grabbed his manhood and sliced it off two inches from the base at around 10.30pm on April 22.Defiant Liezel - who fled the scene - was later arrested and told police she had no regrets about her butchery.She said: "I don't regret cutting off his penis. It's his punishment for being a womanizer. I am ready to face the consequences of my action.""I am tired of his womanizing. He got a new girlfriend lately."Frantic friends helped Mark as blood poured from his wound. They took him to the Jesus Colmenares Memorial Hospital in the Balasan Town district, several miles away.Friends told police that the couple, who have 11-year-old twins and an eight-year-old daughter, were often arguing.Mark was later transferred to the Western Visayas Medical Center in Iloilo City where surgeons attempted unsuccessfully to reattach his penis.Physicians said that because the major nerve had already been severed there was little they could do. Tissue from the part cut off had also already died.Investigator Alexis Bataga from the Carles Police said that Mark wanted to press charges against his wife.He said officers were investigating the incident and have remanded Liezel in custody.He added: "We could not yet ascertain what drove her to harm her husband.""The last time I talked to his family, they told me that he was recovering."
