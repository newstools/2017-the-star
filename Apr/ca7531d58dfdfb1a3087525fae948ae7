Unbeaten Posts Rangers sent a clear message that they are capable of challenging for the league title as they pipped former champions Mathare United 1-0 yesterday to stay hot on the heels of league leaders Gor Mahia.Top striker Dennis Mukaisi dispatched the lone goal with barely a quarter of an hour played to consign Mathare to their second defeat of the season.Sammy Omollo&rsquo;s tough as nails men are now back to second place behind league leaders Gor Mahia after improving their points total to 11 from five matches.To further credit their gritty side, they alongside soldiers Ulinzi Stars, are the only teams yet to suffer defeat after five matches played.Meanwhile, after a tough introduction to life in the top flight league in which they lost all their first three matches, Kariobangi Sharks appear to have hit the purple patch as they secured their second win on the trot against fellow promoted outfit Nakumatt FC in another match yesterday.Masoud Juma scored the all important goal for Sharks 20 minutes from time to hand William Muluya&rsquo;s side all three points that saw them leapfrog the supermarket chain store giants.Both sides named their strongest available sides with Pascal Ogwen, Bolton Omwenga and Cavin Odongo all starting while Nakumatt had a fearsome front line spearheaded by journeyman striker Kepha Aswania and title winner Joshua Oyoo. Sharks had the better of the first half chances with Odongo culpable of missing some efforts.Nakumatt were the better side at the start of the second half with Aswani forcing a save from Jeff Oyemba and just like in their previous matches that have been too close to call, this seemed to follow the same script until Juma, who had been introduced early in the second half for Matthew Odongo intervened with the winner.The win saw Sharks move to 10th on the standings while Nakumatt, with four points from five matches, are a lowly 16th.
