Kenyans are looking to improve on their performance at the 2018 Commonwealth Games in Australia.Speaking yesterday while handing over the Queens Relay baton to Uasin Gishu County Governor Jackson Mandago, National Olympic Committee of Kenya president, Kipchoge Keino said the baton has the significance of motivating the athletes. He said Kenyans have more time to prepare and amass more medals in various disciplines.Kenyans were ranked 9th in the previous Commonwealth Games in Glasgow with 25 medals (10 gold, 10 silver, 5 bronze) while England topped with 174 medals.&ldquo;We are very happy the Queen&rsquo;s baton has come to Eldoret where we have most of the country&rsquo;s top athletes. This is a morale booster and we are looking forward to good performance,&rdquo; Kipchoge said. He urged Kenyans to diversify and take up other disciplines instead if relying on athletics. &ldquo; We are capable of fielding athletes in various disciplines at the games but we have to work on it,&rdquo; he said. Mandago praised the Commonwealth Games for enhancing international cohesion through sports.
