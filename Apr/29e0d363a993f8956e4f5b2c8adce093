Mombasa ODM senator hopeful and lawyer Mohamed Faki has urged the party to allow Changamwe take the seat.He is the sole contender for the seat from the constituency. Faki said in 2013, seats for governor and deputy governor, Senate and woman representative were taken by members from just three subcounties in Mombasa. The county has six subcounties. &ldquo;The governor and senator seats went to Kisauni, deputy governor to Mvita and woman representative Likoni. We want equity in the primaries,&rdquo; Faki said.He said Changamwe, Nyali and Jomvu were not represented in the county top seats. Party primaries will start on April 13 according to the IEBC&rsquo;s calendar.Faki said development has been immense in the three constituencies with double representation and asked ODM to strike a balance. &ldquo;The Senate seat should be preserved for Changamwe,&rdquo; he said on Saturday when he met Changamwe residents at Kimbio Hall. Faki said devolution was meant to ensure fairness and equity in representation and development.He said Changamwe has been lagging behind in development.
