One person was killed in a dawn accident at Kamatira on Kitale Lodwar highway on Thursday. West Pokot police boss Mathews Kuto said the deceased was pronounced dead on arrival to Kapenguria County Hospital. Kuto said two others were seriously hurt, and one sustained minor injuries. “The two are recuperating in the same hospital,” he said. The police boss said brakes of a lorry transporting goods from Kitale to Lodwar town failed while ascending a steep  road. “The driver tried to accelerate but hit a lorry that was ahead of it and then landed in a ditch,” he  said. Kuto asked drivers to be careful during this rainy season to avoid more accidents, saying the area is marked as a blackspot. “One of the passengers who sustained major injuries died upon arrival at the hospital and the two others are still recuperating at the same hospital,” he said. The county commandant has asked drivers to be carefully while ascending of descending the sharp corners during this rain season to avoid more accidents. He said the area has been marked as a black spot and asked driver lying on the road to be carefully. Last year residents from the region held demonstrations and blocked the road demanding the government to redesign the road. The residents decried over increase in road accidents that has claimed many people. This forced the ministry of public works to step in and erect road signs warning drivers to be carefully while using the road. The body of the deceased is lying at Kapenguria county mortuary.
