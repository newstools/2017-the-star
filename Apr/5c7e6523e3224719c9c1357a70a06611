Labour CS Phyllis Kandie has urged governors to pay doctors as directed by the President to avert further strikes."You should not wait any longer to implement the appeal given by the head of state," urged Ms Kandie.On Friday, the Governors insisted that they will not pay doctors who participated in the 100-day strike.Council of Governors chairperson Peter Munya said paying them would be unfair to doctors who chose to serve.About 3,000 doctors countrywide took part in the strike, but about 500 abandoned the strike and chose to work.Munya said the CoG&rsquo;s stand has not changed.&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not go to the Senate to answer questions why I paid people who did not work. That&rsquo;s the stand of the CoG and we haven't met to review our stand,&rdquo; he said in Meru.
