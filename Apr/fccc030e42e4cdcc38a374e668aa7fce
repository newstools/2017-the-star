Ford Kenya Trans Nzoia party organising secretary Patrick Simiyu secretly convened a meeting on Friday at the party headquarters in Kitale and announced the removal of secretary general Martin Waliaula (pictured) and others.He said Waliaula would be replaced by Japherson Sitati, who has been the party&rsquo;s chair for Kiminini subcounty.Simiyu said branch chairman Ferdinand Wanyonyi and secretary Catherine Mukite will retain their seats.Simiyu accused the former officials of disrespecting aspirants and colluding to favour some hopefuls.But chairman Ferdinand Wanyonyi said Simiyu has no mandate to make changes in the party and Ford Kenya does not condone coups.Addressing journalists on Saturday, Wanyonyi said the process was illegal and only the chairman has the capacity to convene any meeting.
