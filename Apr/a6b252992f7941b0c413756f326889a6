MPs spent most of Thursday afternoon wishing each other success in the upcoming party primaries. Both the Senate and the National Assembly adjourned for two months for the nominations. The Senate is, however, likely to be recalled for two special sittings to pass crucial Bills and reports, including the Division of Revenue Bill and the final reports by the Public Accounts and Investments Committee. &ldquo;There might be one or two special sittings after party primaries,&rdquo; Senate majority leader Kithure Kindiki told members as he moved the adjournment motion. He urged his colleagues to promote peace during campaigns and uphold the rule of law. Kindiki urged them to accept the will of the voters. &ldquo;I wish my colleagues all the best in the party primaries scheduled to take place in a few weeks&rsquo; time. We should all let democracy prevail and may the best person win. I pray for peace,&rdquo; Kindiki said. The legislators are expected to resume sittings on June 13. They will only sit for three days before Parliament is dissolved. In a rare show of unity, they set aside their political differences, praised one another, and talked about the good and the bad times in the 11th Parliament.
