The first mayor of Nairobi, President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s half sister Margaret Wambui, died yesterday.She was 89 years old.Uhuru was among family members who visited Lee Funeral Home to view her body.Wambui (pictured) is the daughter of the Kenya&rsquo;s founding President Jomo Kenyatta, and his wife Grace Wahu.She served as the Mayor of Nairobi from 1970 to 1976 and as Kenya&rsquo;s permanent representative to the United Nations from 1976 to 1986. Her tenure in office was marked by many developmental programmes, including expansion of subways, the building of low-cost housing and sewage systems, and the expansion of public health facilities.Wambui was one of two children born to Kenyatta and Wahu after her elder brother Peter Muigai. She was born in 1928 and raised in Dagoretti, Nairiobi, where she would later be elected as councillor for four consecutive terms. Wambui is said to have inherited her father&rsquo;s toughness and charisma and followed him into politics. After high school, Wambui took a teaching post at Githunguri College, where her father was principal. In 1952 when Kenyatta was arrested for his involvement with the Mau Mau, the college was closed.At the time, Margaret was also arrested and detained for a week. While her father served a seven-year prison term, Wambui held various odd jobs and became active in the Peoples Congress Party, which worked for African rights and the release of political prisoners.She also joined a number of social welfare organisations, including Maendeleo ya Wanawake. In 1959, when Jomo Kenyatta was released from prison and became head of Kanu, Wambui also joined the party, serving as assistant secretary and later as the party&rsquo;s Kiambu branch secretary.
