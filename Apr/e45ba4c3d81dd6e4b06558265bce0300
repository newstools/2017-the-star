Two leaders in West Pokot county have hit out at West Pokot Governor Simon Kachapin, accusing him of using county funds in his reelection bid.West Pokot Senator John Lonyangapuo and former Information minister Samuel Poghisio said Jubilee leaders are using county vehicles to campaign.They were speaking at Chepchechir where they were inspecting county and national government projects on Saturday. The two said the national government has sent more than Sh20 billion to the county, but the region lags behind in development. &ldquo;There are no roads, water, health centres or schools, and the area is experiencing drought. Residents of Kopoch walk for more than 10km to the nearest market,&rdquo; Lonyangapuo said.But West Pokot Deputy Governor Titus Lotee dismissed the allegations, saying JP leaders use their personal cars.
