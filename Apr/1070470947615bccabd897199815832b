Jubilee Party primaries were cancelled indefinitely in most counties on Friday following an acute shortage of ballot papers. This happened despite JP secretariat chairman Raphael Tuju reaffirming that the primaries have not been cancelled. In Elgeyo Marakwet, county elections board accused top Jubilee elections board officials of not responding to their concerns. Barnabas Lagat, the elections board chair at the county, said they noticed the papers were insufficient when they were dispatched on Thursday. Lagat accused the party's top officials of declining to pick calls when they were contacted over the looming shortage. "We have been forced call off this exercise until the necessary materials are delivered. We cannot proceed without ballot papers." He said the JP secretariat also failed to respond to his emails on the matter. "I had to call an emergency meeting where we concluded that this process will not proceed until when the matter is cleared," Lagat said.
