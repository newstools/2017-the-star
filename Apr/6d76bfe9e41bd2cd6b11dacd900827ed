MPs have urged the courts not to interfere as they probe state officers.They urged the courts to dismiss a petition filed by National Land Commission chair Mohammad Swazuri (pictured) to stop them from probing him in relation to a Sh1 million bribe he allegedly received.Former journalist Mugo Njeru filed a petition claiming Swazuri received Sh1.2 million to process compensation for standard gauge railway land. He wants the MPs to hold Swazuri liable for decisions made in his capacity as the NLC chairman.On March 29, Swazuri got temporary conservatory orders stopping Parliament from probing him.MPs said oversight is a fundamental function of the National Assembly under the Constitution.They said the sovereignty of the people of Kenya is exercised by their elected representatives. &ldquo;Initiating the removal of state officers is therefore exercising the sovereign will of the people to remove from office state officers who have misconducted themselves,&rdquo; the response states.It said MPs have the right to probe whether petitions are frivolous. The response states that if Swazuri&rsquo;s orders are granted, there would be a breach of the Constitution which provides for Parliament to establish its committees and make Standing Orders for the orderly conduct of its proceedings.The statement also adds the role of the committee is to conduct an inquiryto gather evidence in exercise of its oversight function and determinewhether there are grounds for sacking.
