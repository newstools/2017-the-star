Nandi Governor Cleophas Lagat suffered a humiliating defeat in the Jubilee nominations after he lost to Senator Stephen Sang.Although the official results had not been announced by press time, Lagat was fairing badly, coming fourth after Sang, former Cabinet minister Henry Kosgey and former Agriculture CS Felix Koskei.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy that my dream to be governor is almost [beng realised] and I thank the people of Nandi for believing in me,&rdquo; Sang said.Lagat&rsquo;s supporters blamed the county government&rsquo;s poor performance.Sang has always questoned how Sh13 billion allocated to the county was spent and voters seem to agree with him.Residents have complained that the county government has failed to repair roads and fix the healthcare system.Sang was Lagat&rsquo;s harshest critic.&ldquo;Nandi county had the highest number of strikes by health workers, some lasting for more than three months,&rdquo; Sang said.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s shocking that with all the resources given to us, residents of Nandi still had to travel all the way to Eldoret for treatment because our hospitals are not working.&rdquo; He promised to rectify the situation if elected.Political analyst Paul Melly said Lagat has been inaccessible and mostly relied on his aides to carry out county activities.&ldquo;It has been generally difficult for residents to access the governor&rsquo;s office, and many felt he had alienated them,&rdquo; he said.Runaway graft has been cited as a major problem, which may have led to Lagat&rsquo;s dismal performance.Most projects remain incomplete, while funds for others are missing.There have been many questionable projects such as construction of a gate on the border of Nandi and Uasin Gishu counties for Sh150 million.
