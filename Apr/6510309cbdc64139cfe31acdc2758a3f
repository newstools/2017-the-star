The United Nations food agency has donated animal feed to drought-stricken families in Wajir. Livestock PS Andrew Tuimur, who flagged off a consignment of 800 bags of ranch cubes and 6,400 multinutrient feed-blocks, yesterday said about 700 households will benefit. He spoke at the Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organisation on Kalro-Muguga campus, where the feed is manufactured. Tuimur said it will sustain the animals for two months. &ldquo;The government is supplying water, fodder, vaccines and other livestock supplements to the 23 worst-hit counties. The current rains in certain parts of the country are scarce and drought is expected to persist,&rdquo; he said. Head FAO-Kenya&rsquo;s livestock sector Piers Simpkin said since mid-March, they have distributed feed to Marsabit, Kwale and Kilifi . They target 10,000 households.
