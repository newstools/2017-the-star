ANC officials in Western yesterday took a swipe at ODM leader Raila Odinga over his remarks on Tuesday that the pro-Musalia Mudavadi demonstrations in Kakamega were organised by the NIS.ANC officials and aspirants from Western on Monday staged demonstrations demanding Mudavadi be named the NASA flagbearer, failing which the party would go it alone.They carried placards that read &ndash; &lsquo;Musalia for President. No Musalia, no NASA. Respect Luhyas, chief minister ni wewe (is you).&rsquo;In a report leaked to the media, it was stated Mudavadi would be chief minister, Raila flagbearer and co-principals Kalonzo Musyoka and Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula running mate and National Assembly speaker, respectively.Western regional coordinator Major Malala said Raila should concentrate on ODM, &ldquo;which has enough problems, and leave ANC matters to its owners&rdquo;.&ldquo;Why does Raila imagine no Luhya can do anything on his own? Does it mean he must print even placards for us, and if it is not him, it is the NIS? Soon they will tell us our wives have been impregnated by NIS,&rdquo; Malala said.Fielding questions from journalists on Tuesday, Raila said, &ldquo;That was the work of the NIS. NASA will not be divided because it is 10 million people, much bigger than a few people walking here and there expressing their democratic right.&rdquo;ANC Bungoma chairman Soita Waliaula said Raila uses propaganda against Luhya leaders whenever they seek high office, but &ldquo;it will not work this time.&rdquo;&ldquo;It is not surprising ODM imagines Raila can get between 70 and 80 per cent of Western votes without the assistance of Mudavadi and Wetang&rsquo;ula,&rdquo; he said. Kakamega county ANC chairman Julius Arunga said Raila should stop behaving as though he owns NASA and respect his co-principals.He said the creation of NASA was informed by the realisation none of the anchor parties could wrest power from Jubilee alone.&ldquo;When we started the ANC journey, we were focussed on the ballot and there is nothing wrong when we say Mudavadi must be the NASA flagbearer,&rdquo; Arunga said.
