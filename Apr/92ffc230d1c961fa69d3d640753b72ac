Pokots and Samburus living in Laikipia have called upon the government to stop the ongoing police operation in the area terming it political.They alleged that officers deployed to Muwarak area, Laikipia North sub-county, have taken away their IDs and voters cards.The lot also protested the killing of more than 300 heads of cattle, claiming they were run over by trucks used in the operation.Lemiruni Lodomot, the communities' spokesperson, said more than 30 people have died as a result."Others committed suicide after their animals were killed by the officers. The officers are also torturing us," he told the Star on Tuesday.He said a father of nine took his life after losing over 100 heads of cattle in the hands of the officers deployed to recover illegal firearms in the area."Some of us cannot stand our livestock being shot dead by the officers."Lomodot said the operation should be halted since the community had agreed to form committees to help in the recovery of the illegal guns."The operation has turned into a political fight. The officers come into our manyattas, take our IDs and voters cards and go away with them." He said most of the residents have fled in fear after their Manyattas and motorcycles were torched by the officers.IG Joseph Boinnet denied allegations that police were killing animals. Authorities were not immediately available for comment on the fresh claims.Some KDF officers also sent away reporters who wanted to speak to their operations commander.President Uhuru Kenyatta ordered the operation on March 17 during a passing out parade of AP officers.This followed the murder of British rancher Tristan Voorspuy. The conservationist was shot by invaders when he sought to address them.The area has experienced a series of invasions which taken toll of tourism.Read: Uhuru deploys KDF to flush out armed raiders in Baringo, Laikipia and MarakwetAlso read: KDF deployed to Laikipia after Mukutan Retreat raid, UK citizens warnedNaserian Lomiron said she was a squatter since her property was burned."I don't know the whereabouts of my six children who ran away when the officers shot at us," she said."I pleaded with them not to kill us. The officers are also poisoning our food," Naserian added."They mix our maize flour with some smelly poison. The dogs that we used to test the chemical died instantly," she said.Churi Adomo said they have to hide their food underground whenever they leave their Manyattas."We dig out the floor in the evening. We have nothing to do but eat even if it is mixed with soil," Churi said.The two communities claimed that sometimes, the officers kill the weak animals and load the healthy ones into military vehicles."If they are looking for guns, why are they destroying our properties, burning down our motorbikes and killing our animals. Motorbikes and cows do not own guns," they lamented.The communities are now calling upon the government to come clear and tell them where they went wrong."We would like to know how we wronged our government so that we can apologise and be left to live with peace," Stella Lololutu said.Lololutu called upon the president to address the issue so that they participate in August 8 general elections.She said that they fear the operation is meant to paralyse them so that they don't take part in the processing of electing the right leaders.Samburu West MP Lati Lelelit has called upon the security officers to be lenient with the communities living in Laikipia North.He called upon the operation commanders to carry out the swoop without killing people and livestock."We will compel the government to compensate for property destroyed and livestock killed during the operation.""There are local politicians who are taking advantage of the operation. They should face the electorate and beg for votes. This shortcut won't take them far," Lelelit said.Samburu woman representative Maison Leshoomo and Nominated Senator Naisula Lesuuda said the operation is being executed in an inhumane way."The operation was only meant to evict herders and their livestock from private lands. We support this."But it is surprising that animals are being shot at with bullets and bombs. This must stop," Leshoomo said.Lesuuda faulted security forces for failing to engage area leaders for the operation to be conducted in an orderly manner."It is good that when security forces do their work, they deal with leaders from the area to talk to their people," the legislator said."Why are they shooting at people&rsquo;s cattle? What is it that that cannot be agreed upon," Lesuuda asked.Also read: Negotiate grazing deal with ranchers to end Laikipia violence, Raila asks state Leshoomo faulted Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery for the harsh operation in the county saying is only targeting to punish two communities."I want to tell Nkaisserry that if his aim is to harass Samburus and Pokots among other communities living in Laikipia, he should leave that office.""Since independence, we have never seen or heard about cattle being shot at with bullets," she said.Leshoomo urged the government to pursue and arrest those behind spate criminal activities that have been experienced in Laikipia.Lesuuda said it is unfortunate that some of the herders who have signed grazing agreements with land owners are suffering too.More on this: The poor are the real victims of Laikipia violence
