Last year, Uhuru's eldest son Jomo Kenyatta and his fiancee Achola Fiona Ngobi said: &ldquo;I do&rdquo; to each other at a very exclusive traditional ceremony attended by the who is who in Kenya at an undisclosed location. The young lovebirds have been keeping a low profile since then and were first seen in public at the SVW and Blackstreet concert on valentines day at KICC.The pair made their second public appearance last Thursday during the funeral ceremony of Uhuru eldest step-sister Margaret Kenyatta who died on April 5. Achola and Jomo were among the close relatives who made it to St Andrews Church, where the mass was conducted.The future first lady appeared calm and collected.And we managed to take a photo of Achola sitting next to her in-law Ngina and hubby Jomo.
