The Nyeri government has been urged to involve residents in budgetmaking through public participation.During a workshop organised by the Health Rights Advocacy Forum in Nyeri town on Friday, participants said residents need to be given enough time to present their views to the county.Participants said residents are not given feedback on budget decisions.Organisation executive director Edward Miano said a report sanctioned by the group found residents are intimidated and manipulated during participation forums. The report is yet to be made public. Miano also said the forums are disorganised.&ldquo;There is little support from the executive and lack of quorum during the forums. Participants are also usually late and disagreements mar the forums,&rdquo; he said.
