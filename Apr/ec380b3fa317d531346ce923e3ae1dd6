The Communications Authority of Kenya has closed down 13 illegal postal and courier operators in an ongoing nationwide crackdown to weed out unlicensed service providers. The regulator’s enforcement officers have in the past two weeks been combing Murang’a, Kirinyaga, Laikipia, Marsabit, Isiolo and Meru counties. Most of those arrested and charged in court are matatu co-operatives. They include Murang’a Shuttle, Mt. Kenya Shuttle, Empire Logistics, Nanaisio Shuttle Sacco, Inana Sacco, Liban Bus Service, Machi Modern Bus, Waso Liner Bus, Moyale Star Executive Bus and Northern City Coaches, CA said in a statement yesterday. Others are Moyale Liner Bus Services, Kensilver Express and Moyale Raha Transporters. The suspects were charged with operating postal services without licences contrary to section 67(d) of the Kenya Information and Communication Act, 1998. CA director-general Francis Wangusi  (pictured) has warned courier and other companies in the ICT industry against illegal operation. “It is an offence punishable by a fine not exceeding Sh200,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year, or both, to offer postal services without a relevant license from CA,” Wangusi said. The authority is in the process of degazetting non-compliant licensees, he added.
