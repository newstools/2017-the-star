A court will rule on June 21 whether Kisumu Governor Jack Ranguma and his Nairobi counterpart Evans Kidero have the right to build houses on the environmentally fragile shores of Lake Victoria.On Thursday, Land and Environment judge Stephen Kibunja decided on the ruling date in a Kisumu court. Ranguma and Kidero, alongside Environment ministry secretary Alice Kaudia, have been sued for allegedly encroaching on the wetlands.Michael Nyaguti filed the case in 2013 seeking an injunction against further activity or construction along the lakeshore, pending determination of the application.He said the construction of the houses would harm the environment.Nyaguti said the wetlands are on the verge of destruction, a cause of great concern. &ldquo;This application should be certified urgent and be heard forthwith in the first instance,&rdquo; reads his application.In his supporting affidavit, Nyaguti states the ecosystem is threatened by increased development. He said the Constitution and Environment Management and Conservation Act (EMCA 1999) bars people from encroaching on the riparian land.He stated the wetlands are for grazing cattle and home to hippos, adding human-wildlife conflict has increased because hippos stray from the lake and go to the villages where they kill locals.
