West Pokot County is tense as both Jubilee and Kanu prepare to hold primaries on Friday in the same venues.Some leaders in the ruling party on Tuesday alleged intrigues by two factions known as Jubilee A and B to rig the nominations.Speaking in Kapenguria, Deputy Governor Titus Lotee said the plan to share voting venues will cause problems."We shall do nominations in the same schools. We condemn Kanu because this will create problems and confusion between the two parties," he told reporters.Lotee said Jubilee was well-organised.He dismissed allegations by aspirants in Jubilee B, whom he said are allied to Kanu, that Jubilee A aspirants have already marked ballot papers in favor of incumbents."Those calling themselves Jubilee B are associated with Kanu and have sensed defeat," the deputy governor said.He urged the Jubilee B faction to go to court if they have evidence of rigging plans, calling the claims malicious propaganda."Why are they panicking? [Governor Simon] Kachapin will win the nomination," he said.However, Kanu West Pokot chairman Augustine Lotodo said they decided to conduct the nominations after learning Jubilee was allegedly planning to use members of the former ruling party to rig the polls."They will do theirs as we do ours to avert the plots they have put in place. The IEBC allows nominations between April 13-26," he said.Lotodo accused the county government of using public resources for campaigns."They have branded government vehicles and are using them at night," Lotodo said.The Kanu chairman said county MPs were using CDF vehicles for campaigning.West Pokot Senator John Lonyangapuo also said the same Jubilee aspirants have branded county vehicles with the Jubilee logo.Lotee rubbished the claims, saying only personal vehicles are used."People have taken loans and bought vehicles. We have branded personal vehicles. Government vehicles have log books and no one can use them for campaigns," he said.Kachapin and his staff use county vehicles for official duties."We are still in office and we are entitled to use government resources," he said.Kachapin, who defected from Kanu, will face Geoffrey Lipale and Wilson Kolingura for the Jubilee ticket.Kanu will not hold nominations for governor and senator since Lonyangapuo and former minister Samuel Poghisio, respectively, are unopposed.Read: It&rsquo;s do or die for key UhuRuto allies in mega pollAlso read: Tuju warns Jubilee aspirants against chaos at county board elections
