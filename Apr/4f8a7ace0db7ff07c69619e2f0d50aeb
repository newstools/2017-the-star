Pyrethrum farmers from Kiambogo, Gilgil, will uproot the cash crop citing frustrations by the national and Nakuru governments. A meeting of sector players at Tangi Tano, Kiambogo, on Wednesday made the decision, with participants holding a peaceful demonstration to express their displeasure.Speaking to journalists, the farmers accused the Pyrethrum Processing Company of Kenya, formerly Pyrethrum Board of Kenya, of underpaying them and delaying their dues. They said the Nakuru government has been inconsistent in providing seedlings. The farmers said the allocation of Sh100 million to revive the sector, compared to Sh1 billion for miraa farmers, proves the two governments are not committted to pyrethrum farming.They called on President Uhuru Kenyatta to intervene to save the sector. The farmers said they are heavily indebted and can hardly meet their basic needs.Most pyrethrum farmers now sell dry flowers to Highchem Agriculture, a private processor, with a kilo going for Sh40 depending on the pyrethrin content.
