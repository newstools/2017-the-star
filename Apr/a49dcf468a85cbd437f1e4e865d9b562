The country might face a sugar shortage following the announcement that Mumias Sugar Company will be closed for three months for repairs.MD Errol Johnson yesterday said the company will temporarily suspend operations for routine repairs and maintenance starting April 11.He said the three months break will enable them to fix equipment, which had contributed to the company&rsquo;s poor performance due to inconsistency in maintenance.The closure comes barely a month after the cash-strapped miller received Sh239 million from the government, as part of the bailout strategy.Johnson in a statement said faulty machines, coupled with lack of raw materials, are partly to blame for the problems at the company.The factory accounts for more than 50 per cent of the sugar produced locally. Johnson said the closure was informed by the prevailing weather conditions.He said the final run boil out is scheduled to take place on Sunday April 9. &ldquo;We are certain the company will return to profitability once we are done with the repairs,&rdquo; Johnson said.Mumias East MP Benjamin Washiali last month said the company should be closed for three months and an audit conducted.
