President Uhuru Kenyatta on Saturday maintained that his main aim is to entrench peace and unite the country.Speaking in Kajiado county where he joined the Maa community for interdenominational prayers, Uhuru said no country can develop without peace and unity."Foundation ya maendeleo ni amani na umoja. Watu kujua ya kwamba taabu mbali mbali ambazo tuko nazo hatuwezi pata suluhu iwapo tunafikiria taabu yangu ni kwa sababu ya kabila fulani," he said.This loosely translates to, "The foundation of any development depends on peace and unity. People knowing that the problems we are facing cannot be solved if they are perceived to be originated by the other tribe".Uhuru said his main aim is to see Kenya peaceful and united because that way we will achieve greater things as a people and as a nation.He said the challenges facing the country will not be solved by divisive politics and tribalism but through unity of purpose and bringing people together.&ldquo;We are all Kenyans and we should use our diversity to prosper the country but not to fragment it,&rdquo; President Kenyatta said.Uhuru further commended Kajiado residents for holding peaceful party nominations, saying that enabled them to pick the leaders they wanted without interference.&ldquo;We support the decision of the people and thank you for maintaining peace during the exercise,&rdquo; President Kenyatta said.
