Kisii Governor James Ongwae has told his competitors they will not remove him from office.He said his development record and institutionalisation of the public service speaks for itself. Ongwae said he is confident residents of Kisii will reelect him on August 8.&ldquo;Many thought the governor&rsquo;s position was just another glorified mayoral position. They ran for other positions which they thought were &lsquo;senior&rsquo;,&rdquo; Ongwae said.&ldquo;I read the constitution and I understood what it entails to be governor. [Four] years later they have abandoned their seats to fight for control of the good work we have done.&rdquo;He spoke on Wednesday when he opened Isecha Level 4 Hospital in Monyerero ward.Ongwae said he started without a job description but he has helped put in place structures and hired competent staff who have driven his dream for a better county.&ldquo;The senator and members of Parliament all left ODM for Jubilee. They thought I will be left a loner,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Since their departure the party has grown in leaps and bounds. We are more resolute and strong in our resolve to popularise the party and NASA and its principals.&rdquo;Senator Chris Obure and other sitting MPs defected to Jubilee Party.ODM has since attracted former Jubilee big shot Sam Ongeri who is running for the Senate and Janet Ongera, who is running for woman representative.Kisii is largely an opposition-leaning county, having voted for Raila Odinga in the 2013 general election.Ongwae said NASA is the favourite coalition in the region and he will vouch for it as he seeks for his reelection.
