The Jubilee Party aims to wrest top seats from ODM, Kisii Deputy Governor Joash Maangi has said. He is leading Jubilee’s push to end ODM’s dominance in the county. “We have formed a formidable team to ensure that Jubilee Party wins all elective seats in Kisii. We also want President Uhuru Kenyatta to win the majority of votes here,” Maangi said. He broke ranks with his boss Governor James Ongwae. Maangi spoke at a Kisii hotel on Monday where he met women leaders from nine constituencies. “Jubilee is doing well in Kisii and we want to confirm it on August 8,” Maangi said. He was accompanied by MCAs Catherine Manzi, Risper Kemunto and Tabitha Okong’o who ditched their parties to join JP. Kemunto was ODM Women’s League chairperson. She is a nominated MCA.
