Mbeere South MP Mutava Musyimi has defected from Jubilee and plans to defend his seat as an independent candidate.He will not take part in JP nominations today, making room for NCPB outgoing chairman Geoffrey King&rsquo;an&rsquo;i and outgoing Embu county Sports executive Emily Njuki compete for the JP ticket.Musyimi was elected in 2013 on a TNA ticket. In recent months, the National Assembly Budget and Appropriations Committee chairman has not been active in Jubilee affairs, though he has been urging residents to support President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s reelection.Yesterday, an aide said the legislator will defend his seat as an independent candidate. Attempts to seek comments from Musyimi were unsuccessful. He did not return calls or reply to a text message.Musyimi has been at odds with a number of politicians and senior government officials over sharing of the controversial Mwea Settlement Scheme land. The parcel was allocated to more than 7,232 people.He said the allotments were unfair as the majority of the beneficiaries were outsiders and less than 1,000 of his constituency residents benefitted.Musyimi blamed Governor Martin Wambora and Senator Lenny Kivuti for distorting the process. They deny improprieties.He has urged residents to vote them out on August 8, saying either Runyenjes MP Mbarire or World Bank projects consultant Kithinji Kiragu should be elected to the county top job.Musyimi accused Wambora, Kivuti and several local politicians of bringing politics into the issue, instead of allowing it to be handled in an impartial manner.He called for nullification of the title deeds issued to ensure only genuine individuals are realloted.Musyimi wants squatters in the scheme given 54,000 acres, saying they have stayed there for more than three decades.He accused state officers, including the provincial administrators, security officials, the National Land Commission members, Land CS Jacob Kaimenyi and Attorney General Githu Muigai, of breaking the law.The former NCCK leader expressed outrage that the division of the land was carried out through a group of elders from the Mbeere community (Ngome). He said those in charge did not go to the grassroots to identify genuine beneficiaries.He also accused landgrabbers he did not name of planning his political downfall.
