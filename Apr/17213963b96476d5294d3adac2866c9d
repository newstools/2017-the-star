Chama Chama Mashinani wants the constitution changed for the President to appoint cabinet secretaries from among MPs.Leader Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto said this change will enable vibrant elected leaders who understand the country's problems to roll out necessary development projects.&ldquo;It has become clear that ministers serving under the Jubilee coalition have lost touch with the needs of the people at the grassroots. We need to re-engineer the systems to serve the people better,&rdquo; Rutto said."The cabinet secretaries serving under Jubilee are busy amassing wealth for themselves and their masters at the expense of development."Rutto spoke in Nakuru town on Friday during a meeting with more than 1,700 CCM aspirants from 32 counties.The Governor said his party will support a coalition that commits to devolving 45 per cent of the national budget to counties.Ruto accused the national government of seeking to reverse the management of the health sector yet the constitution had devolved it.He said it was sad that more than 50 years after independence, pregnant women were still being taken to hospitals in gunny bags, handcarts and donkeys while the government retains control of the docket.&ldquo;It is sad that we are leasing medical equipment at a cost of Sh800 million instead of directly purchasing it from the manufacturer at Sh 300 million,&rdquo; he said.Among leaders who attended the meeting were Dapashok West MP Patrick Ntutu who is gunning for the Narok governor post.Others were Nakuru's Peter Koros, Kuresoi MP Zakayo cheruiyot and Lydia Ntimama who is eying the Narok woman representative seat.Read: Rutto defends devolutionAlso read: What's the state of health under counties?In June 2016, governors accused the government of allegedly hiding details over the health equipment deal.Health CS James Macharia on February 6 2016, during the launch said the project will be fully financed by the national government through his ministry.He said the contracted vendors will provide direct infrastructure for the installation of the medical equipment.Macharia said the MES project is sustainable as it allows for payments to be staggered over a long time as opposed to upfront payment as is the case with outright purchase.
