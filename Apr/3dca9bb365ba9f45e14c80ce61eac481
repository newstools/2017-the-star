Narok North MP Moitalel ole Kenta has asked Chama Cha Mashinani leader Isaac Rutto (pictured) to stop imposing leaders on the Maasai community.This followed the Bomet governor&rsquo;s call that ODM should not field candidates in Narok but support CCM.Kenta recently defected from Jubilee Party to ODM. He said they would not allow &lsquo;foreigners&rsquo; to dictate to them how to vote. &ldquo;Nobody has the authority to determine who the Maasai community will elect or not. Rutto must, therefore, stop pretending that he is speaking on behalf of the Maasai community,&rdquo; he said on the phone yesterday.Kenta said he will use Raila Odinga&rsquo;s party to defend his parliamentary seat. &ldquo;If Rutto wants to sign an agreement with NASA, he should concentrate his campaigns in Bomet.&rdquo;Kenta said Maasais are in ODM. He further asked the coalition to be careful about how they treat the Maasai community. &ldquo;We came out of Jubilee to support Raila because of the mistreatment we were undergoing,&rdquo; he said.He went on, &ldquo;The Maasai community sat and decided to support ODM because they feel the party is safe and will fight for their rights. If somebody feels he does not want our votes, he should tell us because we can look for another leader to support.&rdquo; Rutto said CCM entered a deal with NASA for it not to field governor, senator and woman representative candidates in Nakuru and Narok.
