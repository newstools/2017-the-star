The Solar Fire Concentration, a renewable energy firm, has partnered with World Vision and W&auml;rtsil&auml;, a global leader in advanced technologies and complete lifecycle solutions for energy markets, to introduce a new solar technology in Western Kenya. The results of the GoSol pilot project have proved successful, with one bakery and a women&rsquo;s group producing peanut butter using the solar devices and technology since summer of 2016. The GoSol project is now expanding with the support of its new sponsor W&auml;rtsil&auml;. After Kenya, GoSol will replicate the project in Tanzania. W&auml;rtsil&auml; will provide three communities with oven and fish dehydrator. The company will start producing the device next year. &ldquo;GoSol&rsquo;s low-cost technology is part of the solution to prevent adverse effects of climate change,&rdquo; CEO Eva Wissenz said.
