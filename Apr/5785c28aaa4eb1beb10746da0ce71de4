Bishop Margaret Wanjiru was on Friday released on Sh100,000 bail after she moved to the High Court, saying remanding her amounts to violation of her rights.Her release by judge Ngenye Macharia means the magistrate&rsquo;s decision to detain her for five days has been set aside and once she pays the bail, she can walk free.Wanjiru, who had denied charges of malicious damage to property during the Jubilee primaries, said the offence she is facing is minor and doesn&rsquo;t warrant her being remanded.She also wanted the Sh500,000 bond, which she said was too high to be reviewed downwards.On Thursday, chief magistrate Francis Andayi had directed that she be detained for five days and granted her Sh500,000 bail.But on Friday, through lawyer Kennedy Ochieng, she accused the magistrate who remanded her for overstepping his mandate by issuing orders which were not sought by the prosecution.He said the magistrate remanded her although the prosecution did not ask for more time to hold her, pending investigations.&ldquo;The said order also set a dangerous precedent of a court not only granting orders that are not sought, but also allows detention without trial ostensibly to carry out investigations,&rdquo; her lawyer said.Wanjiru was accused of destroying four ballot boxes on April 26, at the City Park polling station.She was also accused of destroying assorted ballot papers, all valued at Sh30,000, which are the property of Jubilee Party.On the creating a disturbance charge, the court was told that the aspirant forcefully stormed the Jubilee polling station and disrupted nominations. Wanjiru denied the charges.The DPP, through Kemo Alloyce, told the court that if Wanjiru is freed on bail, she may intimidate or interfere with crucial prosecution witnesses.This was opposed by her lawyer, who said there is no proof before court that she is a flight risk or she would in any way interfere with witnesses.However, the court ordered her detention for five days.Wanjiru was arrested on Wednesday after primaries at the City Park polling centre were disrupted.She was being detained at the Kileleshwa police station.
