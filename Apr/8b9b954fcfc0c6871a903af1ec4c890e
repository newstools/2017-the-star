Siaya governor aspirant Nicholas Gumbo, who was trounced by incumbent Cornel Rasanga during the ODM nominations on Wednesday, has said he will be on the ballot paper with or without the party. Gumbo dismissed the governor results, insisting he won in five of the six subcounties.He claims in Ugenya, he garnered 15,405 votes against Rasanga&rsquo;s 5,619. In Ugunja, he claims to have received 10,532 votes against Rasanga&rsquo;s 8,915.In Alego Usonga he says he garnered 3,651 votes against Rasanga&rsquo;s 15,649.In Gem, he alleges he secured 20,078 votes against 5,795, in Bondo 23,154 against 4,711 and in Rarieda, he says he garnered 23,992 votes against 3,263 votes. &ldquo;In total, I garnered 96,815 votes against Rasanga&rsquo;s 48,065 votes. Which is 65 per cent of the votes,&rdquo; Gumbo said. Returning officer Joshua Anyona said Rasanga is the legitimate winner after garnering 143,460 votes against Gumbo&rsquo;s 87,460.Businessman William Oduol received 9,535 votes and Carey Orege had 1,908. Gumbo said the poll committee, appointed by ODM and headed by George Rubik, was sacked and Joshua Anyona was brought in from Kisumu without informing the candidates.Making his victory speech shortly after he was handed the ODM interim certificate, Rasanga said the exercise was free and fair.Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo and woman representative aspirant Florence Aluodo also disputed the results. Midiwo said, &ldquo;They can announce anyone they wish, but l assure them Gumbo will be the next Siaya governor.&rdquo;
