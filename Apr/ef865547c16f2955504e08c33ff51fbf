Meru Governor Peter Munya has told Senator Kiraitu Murungi to prepare for defeat as he seeks to defeat him.He spoke after delivring his State of the County address on Thursday. A section of MCAs allied to Kiraitu attempted to disrupt the session.Munya said there will be a political &lsquo;tsunami&rsquo;.&ldquo;The writing is on the wall and you can see the signs of frustration. That is why some MCAs attempted to disrupt the State of the County address &mdash; because their boss is frustrated. But I&rsquo;m telling them change is here with us. The older leadership will go home,&rdquo; he said.Munya said the Infotrak poll that put him in the lead for the governor&rsquo;s race is a sign of how he will humiliate his nemesis.He said the research findings are credible.&ldquo;In steeplechase, if your competitor goes round the field and overtakes you, it means you are one lap behind and you will not recover.&ldquo;So I urge my rival Kiraitu to concede defeat and retire from politics. If he fails to listen, he will see dust in the polls,&rdquo; Munya said.The Infotrak poll indicated 41.4 per cent of the 1,350 registered respondents interviewed on the phone still want Munya as their governor.The survey was conducted between March 29 and 31 in all nine subcounties and 45 wards.According to the survey, the county has a projected population of 900,860.The margin of error was +/- 2.7 per cent with a 95 per cent confidence level.Research consultant Mary Mburu said 29 per cent of the respondents would vote for Kiraitu.Kilemi Mwiria and Boniface Kinoti got 6.3 per cent and 3.4 per cent of votes respectively.Mburu showed 19.6 per cent of the respondents are undecided.Last month, Munya told off Kiraitu for criticising his development record.
