President Uhuru Kenyatta has for the first time admitted that Kenyans have &ldquo;not yet felt the full impact&rdquo; of his administration as the country marked four years since he rode to power.Likening the investments of his Jubilee administration to farming, he said good investments need time to mature.Uhuru said he is aware Kenyans are impatient and want to see the fruits of Jubilee&rsquo;s investments right away.&ldquo;We know that Kenyans have not yet felt the full impact of our investments, but we ask them to give us an opportunity to continue with what we are doing, so that in time, they will feel the full impact,&rdquo; he said.This is the first time the Head of State publicly admitted that some Kenyans could be right in asking what he has delivered, especially with food prices skyrocketing.A two-kilogramme packet of unga retails at Sh140.&ldquo;It is easy to turn around and say &lsquo;ooh, Kenyans have yet to feel it&rsquo;, but, like I said, ask any farmer &mdash; you have to sow in order to reap,&rdquo; Uhuru said. &ldquo;And we are investing in order for Kenyans to reap. We ask Kenyans to give us an opportunity to continue, so that we can unify our country; so that we can secure our country.&rdquo;Uhuru and Deputy President William Ruto were sworn into office on April 9, 2013 &ndash; exactly four years ago yesterday.In an abridged question and answer with his communication unit that was sent to newsrooms, the President enumerated several projects his administration has delivered.He said Jubilee launched a massive programme of building roads, electricity expansion and increasing the number of dams. Uhuru also cited the Jubilee flagship project &ndash; free maternal services.He said for the first time in Kenyan history, patients can get a caesarean section done in Mandera.Uhuru, however, dismissed claims that he had become a tourist President, saying his foreign trips had many tangible benefits.He cited his recent visit to India which he said resulted in Kenya getting a cancer hospital.&ldquo;As a result of that visit, we shall have, in a very short period of time, our own cancer hospital right here at Kenyatta National Hospital, which will greatly reduce the cost and expense that Kenyans have to bear,&rdquo; Uhuru said.He said ethnic politics is rife in Kenya.Uhuru said Kenyans co-exist as ethnic communities as a result of the country&rsquo;s politics in the first 10 years after independence.
