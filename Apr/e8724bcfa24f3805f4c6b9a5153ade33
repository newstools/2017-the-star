The Jubilee's party tribunal is set to deliver its ruling on disputed party primaries across the country on Saturday.On Friday morning, the tribunal had received 93 appeals for all position contested."We have started full hearing of the appeals. So far we have not delivered any ruling on the same but the earliest we anticipate is Saturday afternoon," tribunal vice chair Hillary Sigei told the Star on phone.Sigei said the tribunal will interrogate all issues raised in the appeals before issuing the judgement."We have to collect and verify all the raw data from our field returning officers and further listen to version of all parties in each appeal," he said.Sigei maintained that the tribunal will only consider appeals that are formally lodged after complainants fill a form and pays Sh1,000.Earlier on in a statement, National Elections Board chair Andrew Musangi had said there will not be any re-tallying of already announced results unless an appeal is heard and determined.&ldquo;For clarity purposes, we wish to categorically inform the public and all contestants that once counting is finished results tallied and announced by the Returning Officers, those results stay until and unless someone lodges a complaint with the party&rsquo;s Appeals Tribunal,&rdquo; he said.Musangi said all aspirants who disputed results had been given 48 hours to lodge and file formal complaints and also serve a copy to their respective competitors.He said the aspirants had nothing to worry about or raise false alarm as the tribunal is committed to ensuring every one is accorded a fair hearing.Read: Jubilee tribunal to hear aspirants' complaints from Thursday[VIDEO] Uhuru urges primaries losers to continue working with Jubilee
