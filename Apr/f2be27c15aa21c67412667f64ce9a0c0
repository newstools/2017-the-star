The battle for Deputy President William Ruto&rsquo;s 2022 running mate has intensified within Central Kenya.Narc Kenya leader Martha Karua is the latest influential politician from President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s backyard to have entered the fray in the scramble for number two.The former powerful Justice minister during the grand coalition regime has on more than three occasions accompanied Ruto to high-profile political meetings, fuelling speculation about the new-found dalliance.Discussions have emerged among Mt Kenya power brokers and politicians that Karua, the former Gichugu MP, has been tapped for bigger political posts.Political observers posit that she could be among the heirs apparent for Uhuru&rsquo;s mantle after the August election as the face of Mt Kenya politics, and thus a potential running mate for Ruto in the Jubilee Party succession plans for the 2022 election.Kiambu Governor William Kabogo is said to be interested in being Ruto&rsquo;s running mate in 2022, although Meru and Embu counties are already angling for the post.Former Gatanga MP Peter Kenneth has been proposed as the running mate, which Kenyans are keenly waiting to see if Mt Kenya region can support an &ldquo;outsider&rdquo; for the highest office in the land.Kenneth is one of the JP aspirants looking to unseat Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero.He is likely to face Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko in the JP primaries.Other potential running mates for Ruto in 2022 who are already being discussed include Devolution CS Mwangi Kiunjuri, Meru Senator Kiraitu Murungi and Senate majority leader Kithure Kindiki.In 2013, Uhuru and Ruto agreed that Central Kenya would back Ruto in 2022 after Uhuru had served two terms and it now appears that the DP is scouting for a potential running mate from the Mt Kenya region.In less than one month, Karua has accompanied the DP to two major political rallies &mdash; one in Naivasha two weeks ago and another in Bomet last weekend.The new-found friendship between Ruto and Karua, who is eyeing the Kirinyaga governor post, has left many guessing that Karua is being groomed to be Ruto&rsquo;s running mate.At the Bomet rally on Saturday, Karua said she resolved to work with Jubilee because it has a plan for the country.&ldquo;Jubilee is focused on development and the unity of the country as one Kenya and one people with a common agenda,&rdquo; she said.People of Central Kenya will stand with Ruto in 2022, Karua said.&ldquo;No one thought Rift Valley can work with Central Kenya until Ruto made it possible. We can only reward him by making him the boss in 2022. That is the spirit of nationhood,&rdquo; she said.Yesterday, National Assembly Deputy Speaker Joyce Laboso said there are no permanent enemies in politics.She said it will be an advantage if Ruto chooses Karua as she is a national leader with good credentials.
