Deputy President William Ruto&rsquo;s name will feature prominently in tomorrow&rsquo;s Jubilee Party primaries in the Rift Valley, despite keeping off the nominations. During 2013 URP primaries, almost all aspirants allied to the DP mostly in his Uasin Gishu county, lost due to their perceived closeness to Ruto. Analysts say this year things may be different.&ldquo;You cannot ignore the Ruto factor in the primaries. He is a key leader in this region and any move by him or his allies to either favour or dislike any candidate always impacts on the nominations either way,&rdquo; youth leader Joseph Chumba said yesterday.Claims by Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago and Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi that Ruto&rsquo;s aides are planning to rig the nominations is an indication the DP will be a big influence.Mandago, who rebelled against Ruto in 2013, won the election beating Julius Bitok, an ally of the DP. Ruto&rsquo;s allies have launched massive campaigns hoping to clinch the ticket and battle it out with other aspirants during the August 8 general election.
