Kenyan parties have no capacity to conduct free and fair elections using universal suffrage and that is why primaries are shambolic, an analyst has said.Martin Oloo said ODM and Jubilee lack the capacity to &ldquo;stage a semblance of free primaries and should stop cheating Kenyans&rdquo;. &ldquo;Wait and see what Jubilee will do on Friday. If it succeeds, it will be because they will have used state resources,&rdquo; he said.Oloo said parties should rely on their members&rsquo; register in primaries to avoid shambolic primaries. &ldquo;Parties in Kenya are like clubs with rules that guide them and which are known not to be democratic. Parties should discard the universal suffrage thing because they don&rsquo;t have capacity and cannot even do a quarter of what the IEBC does,&rdquo; he said.ODM primaries in Busia, Bungoma and Kakamega counties were marred by irregularities, forcing the party to nullify the Busia governor nominations and those for Khwisero MP in Kakamega county. Candidates complained of the last-minute change of the register used, &lsquo;deliberate&rsquo; delays in arrival of ballot papers in their strongholds and ballot stuffing.But ODM National Elections Board chairperson Judith Pareno defended the exercise, describing it as largely a success adding party members turned out in their thousands. Jubilee will conduct its primaries on Friday. Jubilee has dropped its plan to use smart cards during the primaries. Political scientist Wasai Nanjakululu said parties should follow the model of developed democracies where party loyalists are picked to run for seats through consensus.
