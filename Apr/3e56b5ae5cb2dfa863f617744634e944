The pharmaceutical industry regulator has automated its services, making it among the first national drug regulatory authorities in Africa to digitise its clinical registry.Services offered at the Pharmacy and Poisons Board, including licence renewals, payments, clinical trials, students&rsquo; registration, trade, inspection, and verification of professionals, have now moved online. The project cost Sh240 million.The automation has reduced delays in service delivery and increased the board&rsquo;s capacity to stem backstreet pharmaceutical practice, according to PPB senior deputy chief pharmacist Dr Fred Siyoi.It would, for instance, initially take applicants up to a month to get a practising licence, but with the automation, it takes the board 72 hours.&ldquo;The automation has also boosted revenue collection measures and improved industry surveillance mechanisms. Payments to the board are now fully through electronic money transfer services,&rdquo; Siyoi said.
