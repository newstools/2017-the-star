Machakos Deputy Governor Bernard Kiala has told CCU party leader Wavinya Ndeti to prepare for tough nominations following her move to Wiper.The two are eying the Wiper ticket in a bid to contest the Machakos governor seat currently held by Alfred Mutua.Kiala said on Thursday that Ndeti was welcome to the party but must be ready to face him in the primaries."This is actually what we have been advocating for. We all believe Wiper is the party that captures the aspirations of Lower eastern residents," he said.Kiala said he was confident about winning but asked Ndeti not to present any conditions for the nominations to be free and fair."The devil you know is better than the devil you don't know," he said, adding he will work with Ndeti should she beat him. "I am not going to the nominations to lose. Should the worst happen, I will be the first person to congratulate her,' he also said adding he expected the same of her.Kiala further reaffirmed that he will accept consensus as a way out of a possible debacle should that be Kalonzo's wish."We have not come together to discuss anything about building a consensus but the proposal has been floated," he said.Machakos Senator Johnson Muthama, who has been campaigning for Kiala, told the Star he will address the press over the issue on Thursday.Ndeti has lined up outgoing EALA MP Peter Mathuki as her preferred running mate.Mathuki dropped his bid and agreed to be Ndeti's running mate.More on this: Wavinya Ndeti joins Wiper, Kalonzo says Machakos likely to get woman governor
