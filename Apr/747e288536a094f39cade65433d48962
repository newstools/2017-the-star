Machakos Deputy Governor Bernard Kiala will look for other options if the Wiper Party primaries are unfair, he has said.He, however, did not elaborate and later said he will not leave the party.Speaking on Sunday at the Light Christian Church Centre in Machakos, he said he will not let anyone to play political games with his ambitions.&ldquo;I want to state that I have no plans of ditching Wiper as many have been speculating, but in an event they push me up to the wall, I will also play a &lsquo;Mshenzi&rsquo;. I will have to shed this diplomacy tag and face my detractors head on,&rdquo; Kiala said.He said he is ready to face his competitor Wavinya Ndeti in the party primaries.Machakos Senator Johnson Muthama, who was with Kiala, said he had nothing against Wavinya joining Wiper but maintained that there will be no direct nominations in the party.Machakos residents should be allowed to choose who between Wavinya and Kiala will be their next governor, he said.Muthama said his support for Kiala should not be misconstrued as an endorsement.&ldquo;I have strongly supported Kiala since he fell out with Governor [Alfred] Mutua and this was because Kiala remained faithful to the party. We saw him as the party&rsquo;s governor of Machakos since Mutua had moved on to form his own party. This does not mean I prefer him to the rest of the candidates,&rdquo; the senator said.Muthama dismissed rumours that he plans to run for Nairobi senator.&ldquo;The word that I had plans to go for the Nairobi Senate seat is an indication that I have grown politically and I am playing in the league of politicians who can run for any seat anywhere in this country,&rdquo; he said.
