Malkia Strikers and Kenya Prisons setter Jane Wacu has revealed she will miss the rivalry she had with the now retired Janet Wanja in fighting for places in the national team.Wacu&rsquo;s sentiments comes barely two days after Wanja, who turns up for the Kenya Volleyball Federation national league champions, Kenya Pipeline, announced her retirement from the national team.Wacu said they formed a good relationship with Wanja since she joined the national team back in 2006, with the rivalry ensuring that they were both on toes at all times.&ldquo;I will miss her in the setting department. We have played with Wanja since 2006. Although we were always battling to outdo each other, we had gotten used to each other and her retiring definitely is something,&rdquo; said Africa&rsquo;s best setter.She added, &ldquo;As a player, there is a time the game doesn&rsquo;t go the way you want and at the back of the mind you are certain that you have somebody on bench who will cover up for you. That was the case with Wanja and I. It is sad but that is the choice she has made and I wish her well in her future endeavours. However, I hope Kenyans will not forget her just us they have done to other sportpersons who have done great things to the nation.&rdquo;Wanja&rsquo;s departure from the national side now leaves Wacu as the most experienced of the probable picks alongside clubmate Joy Luseneka, Pipeline&rsquo;s trio of Rose Magoi, Veronica Tanui and Joan Muindi and Kenya Commercial Bank duo of Farida Efumbi and Gladys Wairimu as well as St Paul&rsquo;s University Faith Imodia.Wacu said there should be no cause for alarm, however, since the understudies are coming up as expected.&ldquo;If the performance by Luseneka at the Africa Club Championships is anything to by, then she is coming up well and so is Tanui, who was part of the women&rsquo;s under 23 team that qualified for the World Championship later this year in Slovenia. They just need to train hard and gain confidence and all will be well.&rdquo;Former national team captain Brackcidise Agala, who was paramount in the Prisons win against the oilers in the quarter-final of the Africa Club Championship, said there is need for Kenyan teams to up their training if they are to compete successfully against other top teams in the continent.
