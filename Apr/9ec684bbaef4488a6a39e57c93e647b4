The government should increase the food rations to families affected by drought and do away with cash transfers as the money rarely reaches the beneficiaries, Ahadi Kenya Trust CEO Stanley Kamau has said.&ldquo;The government needs to come up with a programme where those who are affected by hunger are visited and assisted directly without going through any other bridge,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;In most remote areas, the network is very poor. Most of the families are also very poor and cannot afford a phone to communicate. It therefore becomes difficult in such a scenario. It is important to visit the homes of such individuals and assist them directly with food rations.&rdquo;Kamau spoke after donating food to Mzee Ahmed Hassan&rsquo;s hunger-stricken family in Shantaabaq, Modogashe, Garissa county. Hassan and his wife had one-week-old triplets.He said just like the cash transfers for the elderly, there needs to be proper mechanisms to ensure the kitty is not abused.Kamau urged the government to work with the local administration and other groupings who understand their localities and the residents well to help in distributing the rations.He urged Kenyans and well-wishers to donate to starving citizens.The national and county governments should come up with sustainable livelihood projects, including good farming practices, so that Kenyans do not die for lack of food, Kamau said.They should also harvest water during rainy seasons to be used during droughts, he added.Kamau said studies have shown that Kenya receives enough rainfall to supply the needs of six to seven times its population, but it does not store rain water.The state has started building water pans to harvest rain water.Speaking in Nairobi on Monday, Water CS Eugene Wamalwa said small-scale water harvesting farm ponds will be dug countrywide and a public education campaign conducted to urge Kenyans to harvest water in their homes.
