It has been a month since Safaricom launched Flex. The bundle offering is breath of fresh air and many customers are happy.The thought of having enough internet bundles to keep you online 24 hours is very welcome news especially to a group of Kenyans who prefer to be online throughout.Flex works in such a way to provide sufficient units for voice calls, texts and internet bundles. One Flex unit is equivalent to 3 MB of data, 3 SMS's and 20 seconds of call time.The bundles range from daily units for Ksh99 giving you the user 115 units, weekly units for Sh599 giving you 700 units, and monthly units for Sh2,499 giving 3,100 units.As part of the celebrations, Safaricom rewarded subscribers with an equivalent amount of FLEX points that they have used since its inception.
