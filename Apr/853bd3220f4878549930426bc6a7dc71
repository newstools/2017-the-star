Australian-owned Base Titanium announced Wednesday volume of ore it excavated from its Kwale mineral sands in the first three months of the year dropped 12.79 per cent. The company said the mined ore stood at 2.66 million metric tonnes from 3.05 million tonnes in the October-December period. The titanium mining firm, which made its first shipment in February 2014, attributed the drop to &ldquo;slight curtailment of feed rates whilst optimising concentrator efficiencies&rdquo;. The volume of the ore in the first quarter of the year was, however, 9.92 per cent higher compared to 2.42 million tonnes it mined in the same period last year. &ldquo;The lowered mining rate in the quarter resulted in a five per cent improvement in HM (heavy mineral) recovery in the wet concentrator plant (WCP) in line with recoveries achieved prior to pushing mining rates higher in the December 2016 quarter,&rdquo; the firm said in a quarterly operational update. &ldquo;This is due to capacity restrictions in the sand tails dewatering section of the concentrator that mean that, at high WCP feed rates, HM recoveries fall due to WCP feed densities exceeding design.&rdquo; Production of ilmentile from the ore reduced 3.94 per cent to 112,368 tonnes quarter-on-quarter, while shipments rose rose 26.52 per cent to 122,783 tonnes. Rutile volumes were flat, rising 1.04 per cent 23,107 tonnes, with the mineral&rsquo;s closing March at 21,416 tonnes &ndash; 8.31 per cent higher quarter-on-quarter.
