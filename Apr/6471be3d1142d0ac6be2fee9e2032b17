Governor Jackson Mandago and more than 200 aspirants in Uasin Gishu county have threatened to boycott fresh Jubilee primaries tomorrow, unless their new conditions are met.During a meeting at the Eldoret Sports Club on Saturday, they demanded ballot papers for last Friday&rsquo;s polls be destroyed. They fear they may be used to rig the polls. In the resolutions, they also want the Jubilee National Election Board vice chairperson Vesca Kangogo barred from handling primaries in the county, her home turf.Soy MP aspirant Julius Korir said the tallying centre should be moved from Uasin Gishu High School in Eldoret town to Kapkong Boys High School, in rural parts of Turbo.&ldquo;We all have to go by party regulations on the nominations and there is no way we can set our own rules as a county,&rdquo; Korir said. He said they also want returning officers and polling clerks reshuffled.In some polling centres, voting had taken place under the supervision of the officers. Korir said the fresh ballot papers should be printed in different colours from those distributed on Friday. Uasin Gishu woman rep aspirant Gladys Shollei, Kesses MP James Bett and his Moiben counterpart Sila Tiren attended the meeting.
