The primaries period for the 12th General Election scheduled for August 8 has begun. All political parties in Kenya have a great opportunity to make history for all the right reasons and none of the wrong ones by conducting peaceful, clean, transparent and dignified primaries in which the people actually choose the contenders.It is high time Kenya made a clean break from an electioneering history of fraud, preferment and violence.Unlike all other parties, the ruling Jubilee Party, which has a record 8,000-plus aspirants, has scheduled its nominations for one day only, April 21, an organisational feat that will be closely watched. The nominations for this year&rsquo;s polls should have no element of disenfranchisement whatever. A clean General Election can only be delivered via irreproachable primaries across all parties throughout Kenya.That is the scale of the civic responsibility Kenyans must shoulder as they prepare themselves for their greatest test of democracy yet &ndash; and hopefully the happiest.
