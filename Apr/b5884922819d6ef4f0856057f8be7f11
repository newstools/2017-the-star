Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong and Funyula MP Paul Otuoma have intensified their campaigns ahead of Busia ODM primaries. Ojaamong is defending his seat while Otuoma is seeking to unseat him. The Funyula MP, who is also the ODM national vice chairman, says the incumbent has not initiated development projects and that nepotism and corruption have thrived under his leadership. Otuoma says the nominations may not be free and fair because people who have been picked to oversee the process are partisan. He said Ojaamong has bribed some returning officers and accused the National Election Board of favouring some aspirants. The governor has denied the claims. Bunyala North MCA Fred Bosco Musirimba has defended the governor&rsquo;s record. He says the Busia government has achieved a lot since the onset of devolved governance.
