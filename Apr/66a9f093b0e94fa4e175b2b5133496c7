Talismanic Kenya Sevens star Collins Injera and teammate Billy Odhiambo are expected to be fit ahead of the final two legs of the World Sevens Series in Paris and London next month.Injera played two matches in Hong Kong but did not feature in Singapore owing to a knock while playing for Mwamba in a Kenya Cup match against KCB early this month.Odhiambo, who had to fly to the Asian leg following the late withdrawal of Willy Ambaka and had to play with painkillers and injections on his ankle will also be fit for the final two legs.Speaking on arrival from Asia yesterday, team manager, Eric Ogweno said the duo will be fit and firing at the two tournaments.&ldquo;They are working with our physio Lamech Bogonko and so they should be fit by the time we travel to Europe. Their injuries are not severe,&rdquo; said Ogweno.Ogweno believes they have made a great turn-around with the team after reaching the Main Cup quarterfinals in Singapore, for only the second time this season after Cape Town.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been an up and down season for the team with various challenges but the boys showed character and played smart rugby to get to the quarters and now we hope to finish the season strongly in Paris and London,&rdquo; observed Ogweno.He, however, did not want to be drawn into the controversial penalty awarded by Welsh referee Craig Evans in their 13-12 loss to England in the Main Cup quarterfinals. &ldquo;They had chances put them away and we did not. It was tough for the boys but we have learnt our lessons and moved on to the next one,&rdquo; he added.Kenya face France, Spain and England in Paris. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a tricky pool. France are at home and will be buoyed by their home crowd. Spain are a dangerous outfit since they want to prove a point while England and ourselves have had close matches so it&rsquo;s wide open. We must take our best game to the tournament.&rdquo; The team will have one week break and resume training next week.
