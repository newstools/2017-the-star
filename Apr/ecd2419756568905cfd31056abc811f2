It is American civil rights icon Dr Martin Luther King Jr who once observed, &ldquo;All life is interrelated. Whatever affects one affects all indirectly.&rdquo;We have been reminded of the foregoing following the recent cold blood shooting of two young men, suspected to be members of the Super Power gang, by police in Eastleigh, Nairobi.In the wake of the shootings, a shocked nation has been asking and waiting for answers.A screen grab of an alleged plain&ndash;clothes police officer shooting one of the young men in full glare of the public has helped bring to the public&rsquo;s attention the flagrant abuse of power by supposed law enforcement agencies.Despite much rhetoric around civil liberties in this country - especially with the promalgation of the 2010 Constitution &mdash; these unfortunate events have exposed a society still far from achieving equal justice for all.The killings create a communal awareness amongst the citizenry of their vulnerability at the hands of police. They point to the unacceptably high risk of being killed by a small number of law enforcement officers who regard certain members of the Somali community through the lens of fear and prejudice.I note with some pride and appreciation that former Chief Justice Dr Willy Mutunga, chairperson of the Independent Police Oversight Authority Macharia Njeru and Law Society of Kenya President Isaac Okero have all affirmed that under the Constitution what took place is nothing less than criminal.True, there are criminal gangs in Eastleigh and its surroundings that terrorise citizens with abandon. Yet, it is unacceptable that unarmed young men, regardless of their &lsquo;criminal records&rsquo;, should lose their lives in interactions with police under such callous circumstances.But it is important to understand that these public events point to more than the history of bad community relations. They expose a wider disturbing divide. They demonstrate perceptions rooted in very different everyday experiences and assumptions about of the functions of law enforcement agencies that pervade our communities.It, therefore, behoves us to better understand the historical and legal realities that inform such horrific acts in our society. The majority of comments on social media appearing to support the action of the law enforcement agents points to a bigger problem.Such legal and historical realities are responsible for the culture of extrajudicial executions so evidently entrenched in the National Police Service.We are all interrelated.Complicating the achievement of this interdependence were and are the realities of prejudice, economic inequality and vicious, destructive violence in all of its manifestations.People in privileged positions, living in gated communities, who view police only as benevolent figures are unlikely to indict them in such complicated cases as Eastleigh&rsquo;s. Whenever a close call must be made, law enforcement will almost always get the benefit of the doubt. As society, we need to reckon with these potentially lethal perceptions and assumptions.Going forward, I see a possible zone of moral action that the state, non-governmental organisations and people of faith must engage: That of police and community relations.Where they are frayed, moral leaders must step into the places where there is mistrust and fear with visions and values of interdependence respect and hope. There is need for a lot of work around this question in Eastleigh and its surroundings. There is need for difficult, public conversations about repairing poor community-police relations through changes in policy, greater diversity in personnel, and through holding law-enforcement accountable for professional behaviour, particularly in communities on the margins.There is also need for regular implementation of the criminal justice system that avoids ethnic and religious profiling and discriminatory practices.Compliance with procedures for arrest and sentencing are critical to building trust between communities and law enforcement agencies.
