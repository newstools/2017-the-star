Busia assembly majority leader Josephat Wandera will support Funyula MP Paul Otuoma for governor because incumbent Sospeter Ojaamong&rsquo;s administration is marred by tribalism, he said.Wandera said the Ojaamong team also lacks focused leadership and has a poor development record.&ldquo;It is so sad that Ojaamong has been in leadership for the last four years but our people are still suffering and wallowing in poverty. The governor has done nothing we can show as a county in terms of development,&rdquo; he said.Wandera said the governor has perfected the art of making promises and reneging on them.&ldquo;Change is inevitable. Busia county has been in the wrong hands and we now feel that the time has come for a new leader to redeem it,&rdquo; he said in Nambale subcounty during campaigns to popularise Otuoma&rsquo;s bid.Otuoma said Busia residents have not benefited from devolution because of failed leadership and graft. He criticised Ojaamong for creating the impression that those opposed to his leadership are against his Iteso community. &ldquo;Our disagreement with Ojaamong as a governor should not be construed to mean we are against Tesos. They are our brothers whom we respect a lot and we shall continue to work closely with them to foster development in the county,&rdquo; Otuoma said.Separately, Ojaamong urged Tesos to protect the seat, saying it is the only chance they have to enjoy leadership.&ldquo;We have been marginalised for a long time. There is nowhere in this country where you will find a Teso governor apart from Busia county. Why leave it to others?&rdquo; Ojaamong said at a rally in Angurai, Teso North constituency.
