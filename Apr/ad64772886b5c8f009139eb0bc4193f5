The battle for Changamwe MP seat may prove costly for the Wiper party if it fields four Kamba aspirants i n primaries on April 18 . The votes will be split, which will reduce the chances of Wiper in an area dominated by the community. There are also fears three of the hopefuls will ditch the party if they lose. The MP post has attracted at least eight aspirants, with Daniel Muange, Francis Mulinge, Peterson Mitau and Kennedy Muthini running on the Wiper ticket. On Sunday, Muange, who launched his bid at Akamba Handicrafts, said Kambas should field one candidate. &ldquo;It will be a shame if we disintegrate at this point. We are so close,&rdquo; Muange told aspirants and Wiper supporters. Party secretary general Hassan Omar, who was with Muange, has, however, warned losers against defecting.
