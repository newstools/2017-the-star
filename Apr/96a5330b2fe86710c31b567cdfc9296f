Residents of Kibwezi East, Makueni county, have petitioned the Ethics and Anti Corruption Commission to investigate alleged fraudulent use of CDF.In a letter seen by the Star, they have complained of massive loss of public funds in ghost projects and double or triple allocations to projects.Contentious issues that caught the attention of the locals include the purchase of three acres for Masongaleni Secondary School in the 2015-16 financial year.According to the documents presented to the EACC , the sale agreement of the land was set at Sh330,000, but in the Project GFS Code list of 2015-16, the land is shown to have been bought at Sh1.65 million. When the Star visited the School on Wednesday last week, principal Joseph Matayo confirmed the owner of the land, James Mutuku, was only handed Sh330,000.&ldquo;All we know as a school is that the owner of the land agreed to sell the land at Sh330,000, with each acre going at Sh110,000. That&rsquo;s the exact money he received from the CDF. We&rsquo;re not aware of any figure beyond this,&rdquo; he said.Matayo said the school management was not in any way involved in the transaction since the deal was solely carried out by the CDF office.Also listed as a thorny issue is the double or triple allocations to projects. They include the Masongaleni Earth Dam, which has received three allocations since 2013. It was allocated Sh3 million in 2013-14, Sh2.9 million in 2014-15 and Sh2.9 million in 2015-16.
