A report by influential American NGO National Democratic Institute warns post-election violence is likely unless preventive action is taken.NDI's observer team has been in Kenya for several days, talking to actors in the election process. It concludes the IEBC's job has been complicated by new laws, injunctions and other actions that could discredit poll outcomes.For years Kenya was known as an Island of peace in a tumultuous region, until the 2007-08 bloodletting.It would be unfortunate if we came to accept violence as inevitably following elections. We should ensure post-poll clashes never happen again.We should have learnt lessons to enable us to navigate the election process without the prospect of fighting over outcomes.There is time to act to forestall such an eventuality. Potential hotspots have been identified and action to pacify them must follow.This means organisations like the NCIC and IEBC should engage communities early and police should prepare to arrest troublemakers before violence spreads.The NDI report allows Kenyans to start a conversation and commit to peaceful polls.
