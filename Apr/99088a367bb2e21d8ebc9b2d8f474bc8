Nyandarua woman representative Wanjiku Muhia wants her rivals &mdash; Wanjiku Muhoho and Faith Gitau &mdash; investigated in connection with irregularities that marred the aborted JP nominations in the county.She demands that the JP secretariat establish who colluded with the two aspirants and others she did not name in an attempt to eliminate her, Governor Daniel Waithaka, Senate aspirant Daniel Ndegwa and some MPs and MCAs from the race.&ldquo;This election targetted Wanjiku Muhia, the governor and some MP and MCAs. We condemn those responsible because they have caused a great loss to the party in terms of time and finance invested in the futile exercise,&rdquo;Muhia said on Friday at the Ol-Kalou JP offices. She said some ballot papers had the letter C printed in red against Gitau&rsquo;s name. &ldquo;At Gitei Primary School in Geta, our young men snatched ballot papers marked with a red pen in favour of Muhoho from a returning officer,&rdquo; Muhia said.She said the process was sabotaged by a few selfish individuals who must be brought to book. Muhia urged JP to do all it can, even if it means using the National Intelligence Service, to unearth the scandal.She said some polling centres went on with the exercise even after ballot papers for woman MP and governor were exhausted.In response, Muhoho said whoever marked the ballots in her favour, away from the polling booth, must have been someone contracted &ldquo;deliberately to dent my reputation and make me appear like I tried to rig the nominations&rdquo;. Gitau also denied the claims.
