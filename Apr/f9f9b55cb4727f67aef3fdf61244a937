Frequent power outages and rationing in Meru are expected to reduce after the supply was increased from 23MW to 46MW. Meru KPLC business manager Timothy Waswa (pictured) said they increased the power supply after the number of factories increased, leading to blackouts. He spoke to the press on Tuesday at Kaithe substation. Waswa said the capacity can serve more industries in Meru town. &ldquo;We are ready to handle new customers, including factories and industries, since we have a stable power supply,&rdquo; he said. Waswa said there will be no more power interruptions. &ldquo;The current power transformer was installed in 2010. As the area grows, we will install another transformer by 2025,&rdquo; Waswa said. He said the equipment cost Sh200,000 million to install. Operations manager James Kinyua said electricity lines are vandalised, leading to huge losses.
