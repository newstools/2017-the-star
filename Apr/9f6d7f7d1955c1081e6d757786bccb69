The burning of Mbita MP Millie Odhiambo’s
Urianda village home on Wednesday morning is an outrage. And so was the killing
of her bodyguard in a primaries campaign rampage. Violence against rival candidates at any
stage of the electoral process is an unacceptable descent into barbarity and a
departure from civic and democratic conduct. Odhiambo has spoken of a long campaign of
intimidation and violence during which the authorities have failed to protect
her. She is emphatic most of her attackers are known and come from a single
village in Lambwe, her rival Jim Akali’s home. Akali has denied any wrongdoing and expressed
shock that Odhiambo can group him with the mob. The attacks on Odhiambo must be investigated
in full by ODM, the IEBC, and the police, with a solid case being taken to
court and the Judiciary dispensing the most deterrent justice. The violence and arson meted out against
Odhiambo violate a whole raft of laws and the electoral Code of Conduct.
