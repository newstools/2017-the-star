The government has allocated Sh200 million to get rid of water hyacinth in Lake Victoria, State House spokesperson Manoah Esipisu has said.In a press briefing yesterday at State Lodge in Kisumu town, Esipisu said the Ministry of Environment and the Lake Victoria Environment Management Project are working to remove the weed.&ldquo;It is an invasive species which implies that it grows expeditiously. Consequently it has been a problem getting rid of the plant,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;The harvested hyacinth can be used to make packaging materials as we move away from plastic bags. It can also be used in the generation of electricity.&rdquo; Esipisu said equipment is being bought to fast-track the removal of hyacinth, with 500 youths recruited to harvest it.He said the youths were hired by the Ministry of Devolution and Planning under the National Youth Service programme.Esipisu cited the massive effects of the weed, which he attributed to effluents discharged by numerous factories around the lake.He further called for proper disposal of effluents, and wants use of chemicals in firms at the catchment areas regulated.He said the government is focused to find permanent solution to the challenges facing the fishing and transport industries in the lake region.The spokesperson noted the Environment CS Judi Wakhungu is committed fully to address the weed menace, and has full support of President Uhuru Kenyatta.The initiative is a pilot project towards water hyacinth eradication, which has negatively impacted on those people whose livelihood depends on the lake.Fishermen are the hardest hit by hyacinth effects as they lose business to China, which exports fish to Kenya, due to dwindling fish stock in the lake.Esipisu said hyacinth is the greatest environmental disaster, and it is hurting the lake region economically and socially.The removal of the weed which kicked off in Bondo, Siaya county, will be extended to cover the entire Lake Victoria region, he said.Last month, Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi accused the Jubilee government and counties bordering Lake Victoria of deliberate failure to address water hyacinth menace.Wandayi said it is unfortunate that the noxious weed has spread to unprecedented proportions, yet the governments are not doing enough to salvage the situation. He said Lake region is losing hundreds of millions.
