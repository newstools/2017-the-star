Mombasa Republican Council chairman Omar Mwamnuadzi has been officially declared missing by court, after months of speculations. He has been missing since April last year, after absconding court proceedings.Warrants of arrest have been issued, but police told the court they have been unable to trace Mwamnuadzi.Documents produced in court showing that Mwamnuadzi had been sick and admitted at Coast General Hospital were forged. The hospital informed the prosecution that the admission number belonged to someone else.The court summoned Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko, who stood surety for him, to explain his whereabouts.Sonko was given at least four months to produce Mwamnuadzi before the court or tell of his whereabouts.However, on Friday Sonko told the court that he has been unable to trace Mwamnuadzi.He told chief magistrate Francis Kyambia he sent private investigators to neighbouring Tanzania after reports that he might be hiding there for fear of his life but did not trace him.He said Sonko had two options of either being discharged from being a surety or the state to forfeit his land.Lawyer Yusuf Abubakar, who represents 38 people charged alongside Mwamnuadzi, including his wife, for allegedly being members of outlawed group, told the court the family is a worried lot.He said they have given up hope of seeing him alive. Abubakar said the family believes Mwamnuadzi might have been abducted and even killed.
