Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo has accused ODM of scheming to frustrate Siaya governor hopeful Nicholas Gumbo&rsquo;s political career.He said on Saturday some party officials &ldquo;have pleaded with me to forget about Gumbo so I can get my nomination certificate, but I&rsquo;ve turned down the offer&rdquo;.&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not accept that certificate if Gumbo is left out,&rdquo; Midiwo said.The party national elections board on Saturday said Midiwo and Gumbo lost in the primaries.Midiwo lost to Elisha Odhiambo, while Gumbo lost to incumbent Cornel Rasanga.The two contested the results, insisting they were rigged out. Gumbo hinted at running as an independent.Midiwo said the party has dismissed their complaints and &ldquo;only tells me to dissociate myself from Gumbo&rdquo;.Midiwo warned ODM that the skewed outcomes of the primaries might hurt NASA flagbearer Raila Odinga&rsquo;s bid.&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll not allow anybody to coerce voters to elect people imposed on them. If ODM advocates democracy, it should make room for free and fair nominations,&rdquo; he said.The National Assembly deputy Minority leader vowed to stand by Gumbo until August 8, adding that ODM will be in for a rude shock.He accused some party officials of standing in the way of democracy, which the party leader stands for.Midiwo was accompanied by Gumbo and woman representative aspirant Florence Aluodo in Ng&rsquo;iya, Siaya.They said they have invested in the party and must not be treated casually.&ldquo;We welcome the decision by the NASA principals to award Raila the ticket to contest against Jubilee,&rdquo; Gumbo said.&ldquo;But we request him to keep off county politics and allow voters to decide [in August].&rdquo;They blamed Raila&rsquo;s elder brother, Oburu Oginga, for their woes, saying he pushed for his preferred candidates to win.Oburu also lost the Bondo MP seat to Gideon Ochanda. The ODM NEB upheld Ochanda&rsquo;s victory.&ldquo;Oburu is my uncle, but I&rsquo;m bitter with him. He led election officials in doctoring results. That was done in his bedroom. I want him to know the General Election results will not be counted in his house,&rdquo; Midiwo said.But in a quick rejoinder, Oburu dismissed the claims and told Midiwo and Gumbo to face the reality on the ground, saying he should not be blamed, as it is voters who lost faith in their leadership.
