Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya says his opponents feared him so much in ODM that they did not apply for nominations, handing him a direct ticket.ODM on Monday dished out more than 800 direct tickets to eight governors, MPs and MCA aspirants, decreasing the possibility of joint nominations in NASA.President Uhuru Kenyatta on Wednesday termed NASA&rsquo;s decision to hand out direct tickets an affront to democracy. He said the move was a sign that ODM leader Raila Odinga is not keen on democracy.Oparanya, the ODM co-deputy leader, said the party is the biggest in the opposition alliance NASA and he is ready for his opponents.Other aspirants are Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale (Ford Kenya), Michael Osundwa (ANC) and Jubilee&rsquo;s Mabel Muruli.&ldquo;NASA is a house where ODM is the big brother followed by ANC, Ford Kenya and Wiper, but Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula is not in the NASA ticket race. The number is narrowing down,&rdquo; he said during his tour of Malava subcounty. Masinde Muliro University political scientist Prof Frank Matanga yesterday said direct nominations could be a double-edged sword.&ldquo;It may cost ODM at a later stage, as other aspirants will see those who benefited from the direct tickets as the establishment [ODM] candidates, and usually the people tend to reject them in preference to their own,&rdquo; he said.If other NASA parties come out strong, they could reap big as ODM will be seen to impose leaders on the people, he said.Political analyst Martin Oloo said political parties &ldquo;are clubs&rdquo; and are not known to be democratic.&ldquo;ODM is known for everything except democracy,&rdquo; he said.Oloo said the party demonstrated it has confidence in the members to whom it gave direct nominations.
