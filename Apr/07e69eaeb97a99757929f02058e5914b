Once again, Kenya national cricket team failed to live upto expectations as they succumbed to a 3-wicket defeat at the hands of neighbouring Uganda in the final match of their tour yesterday. Chasing 224 after Kenya were bowled out in 45.3 overs, Uganda were never in trouble on their way to victory with 6.3 overs to play. Derrick Bakunzi (49) and Arthur Kyobe (43) played key roles in Uganda’s chase with brilliant contributions with the bat, thwarting threats that were occasionally posed by Kenyans. Isaanez Emmanuel, with an unbeaten 23 from 35 balls, provided some lusty blows at the death to ensure there were no late collapse hence handed his side the fourth successive victory over their visiting neighbours with three wickets in hand. The run-rate favoured Ugandans throughout the chase and even the loss of wickets did little to dent their momentum. Openers Kyobe and Hamu Kayondo gave Uganda a good start with an first wicket stand of 68 runs in 8.5 overs before the two fell in span of three balls. From 68 for 0 after eight overs, Uganda were suddenly on 73 for 3 when debutant Lloyd Paternott was trapped lbw for a duck. Stray Lions duo of Mukasa and Charles Waiswa got their side to over 100 and then to 123 with a fourth wicket stand of 50 runs in 9.1 overs. When Mukasa was caught off Peeyush Kerai after facing 70 balls, Waiswa was joined by Bakunzi and the two got the scores to 160 before Nehemiah Odhiambo trapped Waiswa on 44 balls 16. Bakunzi and Emmanuel partnered for 8.5 overs to get the scores to 197 for 6. Jonathan Ssebanja didn’t last long, scoring one to leave the scores at 202 for 7 with 10.1 overs to play. But with Emmanuel still in the middle, Uganda were hardly troubled in scoring runs as they did that with 39 balls to play. Earlier, after winning the toss, Kenya’s batting line-up started poorly when Dhiren Gondaria was caught behind for two after only 13 balls of the inning. Kenya then received a major blow when Irfan Karim retired hurt after being hit with the ball, off David Wabwire, after scoring 16 from 22 balls with the board on 22 after 4.4 overs. David Obuya and Karan Kaul got Kenya to 72 after 19.3 overs before Kaul was trapped lbw on 22 runs. Rushabh Patel managed to get to the double digits in the series when he scored 31 from 32 balls as he shared 70 runs for the third wicket. Obuya was finally dismissed in the 35th over with the board on 165 after he had once again failed to transform his 50 to a big score. Nelson Odhiambo (25) and double digits from Shem Ngoche (12) and Nehemiah Odhiambo (11) propelled Kenya to the final score of 224 in 45.3 overs.
