Jubilee diehard supporter Naomi Shaban has ditched President Uhuru Kenyatta for a party she is yet to name.The Taveta MP opted out on Sunday, just days to the much awaited Jubilee Party primaries that will take place on April 21."I am fully in politics but out of Jubilee," she told the Star in a phone interview.She added that she will announce the party she will join after talks with her supporters.In a letter to Jubilee secretary general Raphael Tuju, Shaban said she quit the party due to "unavoidable circumstances"."I wish to resign from Jubilee Party. I will no longer be vying for the Taita constituency seat under the JP umbrella," she said in the letter dated April 8.She thanked all those who supported and worked with her and wished the party well ahead of the August 8 general election.Shaban shelved her plans to retire from active politics in January when she announced that she will instead defend her parliamentary seat.She seems to have bowed to pressure from the constituents who have been urging her to extend her term due to her good development track record.More on this: Naomi Shaban &lsquo;still in active politics&rsquo;Shaban once told NASA principal Raila Odinga that Jubilee will will govern until 2032.&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t put your house in order, Uhuru will win his second term before passing the baton to Deputy President William Ruto, who will lead for another two terms,&rdquo; she said.
