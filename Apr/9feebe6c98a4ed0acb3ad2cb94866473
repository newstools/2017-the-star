The Kenya Pipeline Company is mulling over making last month&rsquo;s 30 per cent promotional tariff on the western route permanent if it continues to experience increased business. Managing director Joe Sang&rsquo; said the move will help the state-owned company recapture the market share it has lost to Tanzania. KPC on March 16 announced a 30 per cent discount on on all transit products in all its depots in Western Kenya. The new &lsquo;promotional tariff&rsquo; lowered the cost of export to $41.55 (about Sh4,288) per 1000 litres from $59.32 (about Sh6,122 ) previously. The new tariff was effected at the beginning of this month. Energy CS Charles Keter approved the new tariff aimed at reducing the cost of doing business along the Northern Corridor which connects Mombasa to neighbouring landlocked Uganda, Rwanda and the DRC.He said the move to make the promotional tariff permanent will be determined by the uptake in volumes of fuel into the hinterland, which include Uganda, Burundi, Rwanda and DR Congo. The landlocked countries have in the recent past increased their imports through Tanzania&rsquo;s Port of Dar es Salaam, citing a high cost of doing business through Kenya. &ldquo;We have lost transit business to Tanzania. We made a temporary price review with a view to make it permanent if we see volume. We need the industry support,&rdquo; Sang&rsquo; said. On April 10, KPC said it had posted a 20 per cent growth in exports, barely 10 days after introducing the new tariff. &ldquo;KPC has exported an extra five million litres of fuel since April 1 when the new tariff came into effect. The company previously exported an average of 3.5 million litres per week,&rdquo; the firm said in a statement. CS Keter said KPC has enhanced petroleum product availability in the Western Kenya and the EAC bloc.
