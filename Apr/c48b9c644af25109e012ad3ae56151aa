It's time to prepare for the biggest show in the country. I am talking about The Search on Kiss TV. The exciting reality show is on the search to discover the next big star in the Kenyan musical scene. It has been a journey filled with laughter and tears as the contestants shared moments together. Several contestants have left the show and we are nearing the announcement of the winner, who will walk away with 1 million shillings and a major recording deal. It&rsquo;s never easy to win such a huge amount of money, which is the reason why the teams are working extra hard to walk away with the money. When I was younger, I used to be an aspiring musician. However, when I grew up, I realized that it&rsquo;s more than just reciting someone else&rsquo;s lyrics. For people who are passionate like the teams on The Search, this is totally different for them. They would love to pursue music as a long term life engagement.This is the exact reason why you should tune in this weekend as it will be a really exciting show!Tune in to Kiss TV on Sunday to catch the show:
