Major political parties and the police have reached a deal in which officers will provide security during party primaries.Among the parties that have agreed to have the police escort their ballot papers and provide security at the tallying centres include Jubilee, ODM, ANC, Wiper, and Ford Kenya.ODM, Wiper, Ford Kenya and ANC are under NASA, but each party will conduct its own primaries.The parties have agreed the police will also provide security during voting, manage voters and any other security aspect agreed on.Wiper and ODM are today expected to start their nominations in different parts of the country. In 2014, ODM internal party elections were marred by violence after men dressed in black disrupted the meeting at Kasarani.The men in black, who were hired to provide security, ended up destroying voting materials and attacked a rival group.ODM had organised its own security system and hired youths to provide security, but the meeting ended in disarray after the party security systems failed. Yesterday, Nairobi police chief Japheth Koome (pictured) met divisional police commanders to plan for the nominations. The same strategy was replicated in all 47 counties.A different team of officers from police headquarters - Vigilance House - met political party chiefs to firm up details on security.Yesterday, assistant Inspector General of Police Henry Barmao told police commanders to engage politicians on the ground during the nominations.Barmao, who is the deputy head of operations at Vigilance House , in a memo sent to all police commanders, instructed police chiefs to negotiate with politicians on which aspects of security parties want the police to take charge of.
