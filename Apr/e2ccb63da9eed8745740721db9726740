Tough-talking Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero has secretly paid doctors for the 100 days they were on strike.Governor Kidero last Wednesday announced he would not pay a cent even after President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s plea for the counties to pay as a gesture of goodwill.But behind the public bravado, he instructed his officers to find the cash and pay by the end of March.On Sunday, the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union Nairobi branch boss Thuranira Kaugiria told reporters that city doctors had been paid their March salaries, and that the county was processing the arrears.However, Nairobi health chief Dr Bernard Muia said he was not involved and could not comment.&ldquo;I only deal with policy issues. Matters to do with money, especially for the workers, are not in my docket. I cannot comment on such a delicate matter,&rdquo; he told Nairobi News.Kaugiria said governors are using the doctors strike to gain mileage because it could help in their reelection campaigns.&ldquo;These governors are looking for political mileage. Even the Council of Governors chairman Peter Munya has paid his doctors. We are not worried by these utterances,&rdquo; Kauguria said.Governors have publicly announced that they would not comply with President Uhuru&rsquo;s request because &ldquo;they cannot pay for work not done&rdquo;.The 100-day strike started on December 5, last year and was called off on March 14.Kaugiria said the union was concerned about the delayed signing of the CBA and recognition because only 30 of the 47 counties have signed the deal. They have up to the end of May to complete the process.Nairobi county employs 250 doctors, most of whom work in the four main hospitals in the city &mdash; Mama Lucy Kibaki, Mbagathi, Pumwani and Mutuini.
