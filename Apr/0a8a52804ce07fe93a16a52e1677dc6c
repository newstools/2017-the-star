A mob of rowdy youths on Friday destroyed ballot boxes and papers at Kiamugumo Primary School polling centre in Kirinyaga county during the Jubilee Party primaries. They stormed the polling centre at 2pm just as voting was about to begin and overpowered the two officers on guard. On Thursday, Kirinyaga county commander Joseph Nthenge had promised to provide security in all polling stations. The centre is governor aspirant Anne Waiguru’s polling station. By the time of going to the press voting had not started at the station, neither had Waiguru cast her ballot. Other centres in Ndia and Mwea constituencies reported few ballot papers and boxes. Presiding officers said the party asked them very late to find transport and taxi drivers were charging more than the party allocated. Voting started in the afternoon though voters had turned out as early as 6am. Kirinyaga county JP coordinator Martin Mwangi could not explain to the Star the cause of the delay, only saying it was caused by “a few problems”. Some aspirants said the delay was a strategy to rig the poll as the party seems to have preferred candidates. Kirinyaga Central MP aspirant Beth Ngunyi told the Star the polling is not credible and neither is it free and fair. Aspirant Josiah Murigu also said the process was flawed. When asked for comment on the Kiamugumo incident, Nthenge said he would call back later. By press time he had not.
