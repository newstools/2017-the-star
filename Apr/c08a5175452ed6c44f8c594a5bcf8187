The state has acquired surveillance equipment to monitor hatemongers ahead of the election, Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery has said.&ldquo;Those private chats you make under your roofs, aimed at inciting Kenyans will be monitored to the letter and our officers will come for you,&rdquo; Nkaissery said on Saturday.He spoke in Birrika shopping centre, Kajiado West, during a rally organised by Maasai professionals to drum up support for President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s reelection.The announcement that the state will tap private phone conversations comes barely two months after the Communications Authority claimed the government had no such intentions. The authority was responding to outbursts by Kenyans opposed to the plan.According to the CA the Device Management System would detect counterfeit devices in the country and stop SIM Box technology, which is illegal in Kenya.However, reports in the mainstream media indicated the system would tap user&rsquo;s information and the government would have the power to spy on subscribers.In February, CA director general Francis Wangusi said the system has nothing to do with content or anything being transacted on the networks. &ldquo;The device has only one way and it is being managed by the Communications Authority of Kenya. The device can only be queried by the mobile subscribers,&rdquo; he said.Wangusi said there is no way the CA can access subscribers&rsquo; information with the system. He said the DMS represents the second phase of the device verification process started in 2012, and that was agreed on by all stakeholders in the industry.&ldquo;The authority is in the process of deploying the second phase of the system to manage the menace of counterfeit devices,&rdquo; Wangusi said.The Consumer Federation of Kenya said it intended to go to court to challenge the implementation of the system.Wangusi also said the resistance by some mobile networks is based on the fact they currently benefit from illegal SIM Box technology and income from counterfeits.But Nkaissery did not explain how the state will tap into private conversations, except that security agencies have been supplied with the gadgets.He also said those creating parallel tallying centres to announce presidential vote results will be arrested and prosecuted.&ldquo;As long as I&rsquo;m still the Interior CS, do not dream that you can bend the law and go scot-free. I will deal with you as per the provisions of the existing laws of the Republic,&rdquo; Nkaissery warned.He made it clear he was speaking as a CS, not a politician. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fighting for the government and the President to win in the election, because if he is defeated, I will also go home. I do not want to go home,&rdquo; Nkaissery said
