Moses Kuria is a ninja. He got to say the 'F' word on TV and walk away as jaws dropped all over the nation. Reactions include:Eric Kinyumu I think he was calling some Chinese guy called Fiak Yu. Kimani Ken I think Moses Kuria wanted to say 'Thank You'. The 'f 'and the ' th' will be explained as 'chida ya matamchi'. M&aacute; Joan Hehe! Na huyu Kennedy Muriithi huwa na bahati mbaya ya kutoanishwo ni politicians. Mara "your name betrays you" and now "f**k you"! Woishe Ken! Maxamoudh Al Azbek what pisses me off is the amount of nonsense that some people comment This goon had an option of walking out like he does or just be civil instead he chose to be Donald trump, why do Kenyan love mediocrity why do you love so much stupidity and less. shame on you.
