They also don't know the owner of the car. We are anxious and in pain," Fatma Yusuf, Abbas' second born daughter, told the Star on Tuesday. &ldquo;If they are kidnappers why should they go for a frail and poor old man?&rdquo;Yusuf pleaded for her father to be set free and his whereabouts revealed saying he needs medical attention.Relative Fatma Athman said: &ldquo;My uncle suffers from several chronic ailments including diabetes, high blood pressure and hernia. We appeal for any information on his whereabouts so we can take care of him."Abbas was a trustee of the mosque in Majengo before he retired to his Nyeri home.
