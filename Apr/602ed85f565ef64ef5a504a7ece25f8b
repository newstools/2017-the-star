The Queen may rule over the people of Britain but her taste in food is refreshingly ordinary, it has been revealed.From spicy Tabasco sauce to a can of fizzy Coca-Cola, dozens of everyday, affordable brands that are stocked on supermarket shelves up and down the country have been granted a royal warrant by Her Majesty.A warrant from Queen Elizabeth II means that a company has supplied her and her household with some of its products for at least five years out of seven and is generally seen as a mark of excellence.Today, Walkers has been awarded its second seal of approval for the supply of shortbread to the Queen.But what are the other snacks and drinks that fill the kitchen shelves of Buckingham Palace?FEMAIL has rounded up the very normal foods and drinks that are thought to be a favourite of the 91-year-old monarch.The Queen is certainly partial to a sweet treat - her favourite being a homemade chocolate biscuit cake made by her chefs which she has a piece of every day.But just like the rest of us, she likes to indulge in a chocolate bar now and again too.She favours luxury chocolate brands Prestat and Charbonnel et Walker - most famous for its pink Marc de Champagne truffles.But Her Majesty doesn't just favour posh chocolates.It's claimed that Cadbury makes her a special recipe dark chocolate bar every Christmas.The company holds a royal warrant so it's perceivable that's she's also partial to a bar of Dairy Milk and a mug of warming Cadbury hot chocolate too as the royal coat of arms are on both of these products.Nestle - the makers of Kit Kats, Quality Street and Rolos among others - also supplies the royal household.It's the drink associated with luxury and refined society, so it's no wonder then that there are no fewer than seven champagne makers who have been given the seal of approval by the Queen's household.Bollinger has held a royal warrant since 1884, when it was awarded by Queen Victoria.And it's remained a staple of the royal household ever since.The Queen is reported to be a fan of gin and it's said she likes to drink it straight before lunch.But if she chooses to have it with tonic then she'll probably choose one made by Schweppes which holds a royal warrant.It also seems she and her household are partial to a fizzy drink as both Lucozade and Coca-Cola hold warrants too.We wonder what the Queen thinks of Lucozade's new recipe, which has seen its sugar slashed to less than 4.5g per 100ml.Aside from Champagne, the royal household has a few favourite tipples.It's been reported the Queen enjoys a glass of Dubonnet vermouth before lunch.Tanqueray Gordon &amp; Co - which owns Gordon's as well as Tanqueray - makes Her Majesty's gins, though it's not confirmed if she prefers one brand over the other.The brands are all recognisable and sold on supermarket shelves up and down the country.Heinz was first sold in the UK at Fortnum &amp; Mason - greengrocer to the Queen - 145 years ago.So it's no surprise that the company holds a royal warrant - meaning the monarch could enjoy dipping her food into ketchup and even tucking into a late night beans on toast.It seems unlikely, but it is possible.She spends every summer at Balmoral castle in Scotland so it's no surprise that Scottish family-run firm Walkers has been given the royal seal of approval for both its shortbread and its Scottish oatcakes.It's also been reported that the Queen starts her day with a bowl of Special K, as Kellogg's holds a royal warrant, but Weetabix is another option for Her Majesty.Premier Foods is yet another company given the thumbs up by the royal household.Kipling made special cakes to celebrate the Queen's 90th birthday last year, so it's a distinct possibility the monarch enjoys tucking into some of the company's cakes.
