Villagers in Keiyo South discovered a 1.5-metre long live snake in the stomach of a slaughtered cow.Residents of Kapkong&rsquo;a village said they had gathered to share the beef on Wednesday morning, when they discovered the cobra.Area chief Joseph Kimosop said the cow died on Tuesday evening, after its stomach became bloated.He said the men who were slaughtering the cow scampered for safety when they saw the snake. &ldquo;They discovered a large living thing as they slit the cow&rsquo;s belly. That is when they noticed it was a huge snake,&rdquo; Kimosop said.He said the snake crawled out of the cow&rsquo;s intestines and was killed by residents. &ldquo;We have never witnessed such an incident. Villagers normally associate such incidents with witchcraft,&rdquo; Kimosop said.Owner Jonah Tenai said the cow was eight months pregnant.He said the men slaughtering the cow thought the creature under the belly was the unborn calf.Tenai said local veterinary officers are yet to explain how the snake got inside the cow&rsquo;s stomach.He dismissed accusations by villagers that he engages in witchcraft, saying he does not believe in black magic.&ldquo;Villagers are still thronging my homestead to look at the carcass. I have informed a veterinary officer, who examined the cow and the snake, but is yet to give a report,&rdquo; a dumbfounded Tenai said.
