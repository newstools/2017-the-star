Radio Africa Group journalists have been urged to report objectively on the August 8 General Election and avoid libel suits.The appeal was made by Group&rsquo;s political editor Paul Ilado during a one-day media training workshop on how to cover elections. The event was at Safari Park Hotel in Nairobi on Saturday.Ilado said, &ldquo;For you to be on the safe side, ensure you present accurate information. Cover the views of all political competitors. News reports should never attempt to tell voters who to vote for. Remain independent and resist all forms of political persuasion.&rdquo; He also cautioned the media against wearing T-shirts and cap associated with a political party or candidate, saying this would amount to violation of media ethics. &ldquo;As professional journalists, you should be non-partisan,&rdquo; Ilado said.Group&rsquo;s legal adviser Linda Musita urged journalists to always refer to the files, while reporting court stories. She urged them to make an effort to get comment from a person mentioned in an allegation.Also present were Editor-in-Chief Charles Kerich, News Editor Francis Mureithi, Head of Radio news Susan Kiprono and Training Editor Victoria Graham.
