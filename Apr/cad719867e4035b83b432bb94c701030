Gloria Muliro's estranged husband pastor Eric Omba seems to have settled down again after they parted ways. The Congolese pastor and his partner Bella, a light-skinned woman, welcomed a baby girl mid-last year, who they named Eliana Omba. Although it’s not clear if they are officially married, Omba is never shy of sharing photos of his family, and his social media pages are full of pictures of Bella and her daughter. "God first and family second," he posted a photo of his partner carrying their daughter and captioned. He is a proud father. The video producer and music promoter is also doing well in his career, and of late he has been busy working with different artistes, including Kanyari's ex-wife Betty Bayo.
