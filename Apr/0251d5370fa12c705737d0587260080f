A High Court judge in Kisumu has disqualified himself from a case in which a former Star Newspaper reporter sued the Attorney General over alleged arrest, torture and detention by police.Appearing before Justice David Majanja on Wednesday, Justus Ochieng&rsquo; claimed a CID officer only identified as Mr Njeru had been linked to the alleged crimes, prompting the judge to disqualify himself from the case.&ldquo;I have to disqualify myself from this matter, because I&rsquo;m presiding over a murder case where the said Mr Njeru is a party,&rdquo; the judge said.He referred the case to Justice T W Cherere for hearing.In his affidavit, Ochieng&rsquo; states that he was arrested, wrongfully detained for eight hours and tortured for unknown reasons.He says he was arrested on October 29, 2014, while following up on a report he made at the Kisumu Central police station over a threat to his life by Flying Squad officers.Ochieng&rsquo; stayed in police cells until October 30 at 1am, when he was released. He was not taken to court. Ochieng&rsquo; in his affidavit says his arrest was meant to intimidate and undermine his work as a journalist. The case will be heard on June 14.
