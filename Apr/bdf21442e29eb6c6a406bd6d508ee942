The Kisumu government has set aside Sh3 million to fight crop pests which have invaded farms causing massive losses. Agriculture executive Henry Obade said the county has bought chemicals that will get rid of army worms. Addressing the press on Thursday at his office, Obade said farmers have reported army worms invasion in their farms, with maize plantations being the hardest hit. He said Nyando subcounty is the most affected, and agricultural officers have been deployed to the area. Obade told farmers affected to report to the officers. Obade said they have bought an insecticide, Lambda cyhalothrin, which kills a variety of insects and worms including aphids, beetles, and butterfly larvae. The pesticide is used to kill potential disease vectors such as cockroaches, mosquitoes, ticks and flies. Several farmers in the country, mostly the Western region, Vihiga, Bungoma, Busia, Trans-Nzoia, Kitale and Kakamega have reported the invasion of army worms in their farms, where hectares of maize crops have been destroyed.
