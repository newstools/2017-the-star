This puts the national and county governments on the spot.A study report, &lsquo;Are Our Children Learning&rsquo;, by Coast Education Centre in partnership with Uwezo Kenya has revealed inadequate efforts by the two governments to support education.It says the national government contributed only seven per cent toward education of pupils between 6-16 years in Mombasa since 2013, while the county&rsquo;s contribution is 14 per cent.&ldquo;This has not improved education standards in the county,&rdquo; COEC chairman Yusuf Abubakar said during the launch at a Mombasa hotel on Friday.The report says less than 50 per cent of pupils moving to class three can&rsquo;t read and understand what they were taught in class two and 10 per cent of class eight pupils cannot do class two work.
