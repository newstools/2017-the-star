ODM's declaration that the NASA flag bearer report is valid is "bad manners" and undermines the coalition's unity, Amani secretary general Geoffrey Otsotsi.A report emerged from NASA's technical committee indicating they had settled on Raila Odinga (ODM) as the presidential candidate and Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper) as his running mate.NASA principals were expected to deliberate on the matter, but Musalia Mudavadi's Amani National Congress dismissed as inaccurate. The fourth principal is Moses Wetang'ula, who is Ford Kenya leader and Bungoma Senator.More on this: NASA flag bearer report 'accurate', ODM saysAlso read: It's Raila-Kalonzo! NASA experts sayODM secretary general Agnes Zani said NASA&rsquo;s National Coordinating Committee had been mandated to come up with the report which they did after 60 days of negotiations.She earlier said the report was erroneously leaked to the media but that is was valid and existent.But Osotsi said Amani was not aware of a formal report authored by the committee for sharing with the four principals on matters flag bearer."We are outraged - and Zani ought to know - that admission by ODM party that it is responsible for dirty propaganda leaks undermines the credibility and integrity of the NASA process," he said.In a statement on Tuesday, the Amani secretary general said his ODM counterpart's level of arrogance should not be entertained."Zani is in error of judgment, purporting to speak for the NCC. It is only the co-chairs who are authorised to speak for NCC as a team and vouch for authenticity of documents," he said.Osotsi noted the last time the co-principals spoke on the matter, they disowned the report."Zani gets the mandate of the NCC wrong; NCC doesn&rsquo;t have the mandate to identify a NASA flag bearer," he said."It is this flawed arrogation of assumed mandate by a party to negotiations that could jeopardise NASA's unity of purpose."The official added that the Orange Party's statement was a confession that leaves no doubt as to where leaks of working documents meant to undermine NASA unity have been coming from."It is confirmation that ODM is negotiating in bad faith. This is bad manners that shouldn&rsquo;t be entertained in any negotiation," he said.Part of the leaked proposal is to create the position of a chief minister, equivalent to the powerful position of Prime Minister, who will be a first among equals in the NASA Cabinet.The position, to be occupied by Mudavadi, will have sweeping powers to whip the Cabinet and will have an expanded mandate to supervise and coordinate government business.The creation of this position would however neutralise the current powerful position of the National Assembly Majority leader held by Garissa Township MP Aden Duale.The principals, however, have created the leeway to adopt the report the way it is, or introduce amendments that will inform the preelection coalition agreement.
