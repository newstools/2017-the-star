Mutomo Primary School head master David Munyao was arrested at Makuti guest house on Wednesday afternoon after he was found with a form three student. Mutomo police boss Kingford Nyaga yesterday said the girl complained of sexual assault. “The girl is young and in form three, but she has to undergo medical examination so that we can ascertain her actual age,” he said. Nyaga added that the teacher would be charged with sexual assault, torture and harassment. “Even as the teacher appears in court, we are carrying out investigations to establish details on the circumstances that brought the two together, leading to the arrest of the teacher. I will give you the details later when I get them,” he said.
