A Mombasa court has temporarily barred the state from charging Changamwe MP Omar Mwinyi for allegedly destroying ballot boxes during the nominations.Chief magistrate Evans Makori deferred Mwinyi&rsquo;s plea-taking for 14 days. He faces violence, destruction and interference charges.The magistrate said the Director of Public Prosecutions should use the time to interpret the Election Act in connection with the offence by the MP. He said the law gives the DPP powers to prosecute cases of presidential, county and general elections, not party primaries. The ODM MP had told the court the party has launched disciplinary action against him and the DPP should wait for the verdict. He is alleged to have obstructed and destroyed ballot boxes in two stations during the ODM nominations on Saturday.
