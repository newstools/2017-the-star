Kenya Sevens rugby team kicked off their Hong Kong Sevens campaign on a false note after losing to Canada 17-15 in a hotly contested Pool &lsquo;B&rsquo; opening match at Hong Kong Stadium. Luke McCloskey capitalised on Shujaa&rsquo;s poor marking in the opening five minutes to score the first try before Nathan Hirayama made a successful conversion a minute later to ensure Canadians ended the first half with seven points ahead of the Innocent Simiyu&rsquo;s boys.Kenya&rsquo;s Dennis Ombachi scored a try to reduce the deficit in the 10thminute to take his career tally to 27 tries before Samuel Oliech converted the kick to ensure parity. However, defensive lapses on the Kenyan side allowed Harry Jones to extend Canada&rsquo;s lead with a try in the 12th minute and Nathan Hirayama made no blunder with the conversion.Nelson Oyoo, a second half substitute made in a successful run in the Canadian half to score a try for the Shujaa in the 14th minute and Oliech successfully made his second conversion of the game. Cautious play from both sides would have seen the two teams share spoils for the second time out of 26 times they have met.However, an extra-time penalty by Canadian Nathan Hirayama in the 16th minute separated the scores and ensured his side recorded a win in the first game of the Hong Kong Sevens. After his role in yesterday&rsquo;s match, Hirayama became the top sevens points scorer of all time with 81 tries, 980 conversions in 210 matches.Shujaa will face series leaders Republic of South Africa today at 8:56am before wrapping up their Pool &lsquo;B&rsquo; preliminary matches against France at 12:34pm.
