The high court has temporarily stopped the national athletics governing body, Athletics Kenya from carrying out elections. Justice Chacha Mwita yesterday said AK should also put on hold the ongoing grassroots elections that commenced on April 27 pending hearing and determination of an application filed by ten former athletes.The elections at the ward level were expected to culminate with national polls slated for May 13 but will be suspended until further directions of the court. Justice Chacha issued the order after the athletes told him that they were apprehensive because any elections carried out under the current constitution will produce flawed electoral results that do not reflect their will and that of stakeholders.&ldquo;The forthcoming elections based upon the amended Constitution adopted by the Annual General Meeting of April, 27, 2016 is thus not representative of the stakeholders of athletics in Kenya, lacks legitimacy and ought not to be held until the Petition herein is heard and determined, &rdquo; their lawyer Kibe Mungai argued.The lawyer said athletics governing body is yet to be issued with a Certificate of Registration under the Sports Act, 2013 and so the elections as scheduled will amount to serious violations of the law.AK had announced that it will hold its national elections on May 13, in Nairobi while the electoral process will start on April, 27 at the ward level.Sub-county level elections were scheduled to be held on May 2 and May 6 respectively while the regional elections were to be held on May 9, 2017.The aggrieved athletes are Moses Tanui, Julius Korir, Julius Kariuki, Christopher Kosgei, Wilson Boit, Susan Sirma, Leah Malot, Nixon Kiprotich, Hosea Kogo and Mary Chemweno.The application has been certified and urgent and will be heard on May 10. The athletes had earlier moved to court and obtained orders stopping the constitution review process and registration of the AK.In the present application, it is their case that AK has colluded with Sports Cabinet Secretary and Registrar of Sports to secure the registration through an opaque means.&ldquo;The manner in which they have sought the registration is a mockery of the fairness and democratic provisions in the Sports Act and the Constitution&rdquo; says Tanui in an affidavit. The athletes argue that no free and fair elections can be carried out under the current constitution which is based on amendment of the body&rsquo;s repealed constitution.
