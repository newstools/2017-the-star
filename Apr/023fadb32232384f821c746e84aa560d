Nakuru chief magistrate Josephat Burudi has ordered a prison warden to produce a convict who allegedly stabbed Eunice Kelly, a magistrate, during court proceedings on November 22, 2016. She had sentenced Michael Kohora (pictured) to three year for an offence he commited on 2014. Burudi wants Kohora in court on Monday for the hearing of the appeal case.
