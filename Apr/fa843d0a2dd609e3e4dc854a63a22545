The Jubilee government is using economic strangulation, manipulation and infiltration to suppress the media, an NGO has said.Despite the promise of new media, the 2017 edition of Attack on the Press by CPJ published this week documents vast censoring of information by governments across the world using financial pressure on journalists and news outlets exploitation of legal loopholes to avoid disclosure of copyright laws and social media to curb criticism.Unlike in the past where regimes have launched raids on newsrooms, seized newspapers, beaten up and even murdered journalists, Committee to Protect Journalists said Kenya is using fiscal blackmail to silence critical journalists and their media houses.&ldquo;Murder is messy. Money is tidy... a less messy mechanism for constraining the free media. Murder can lead to awkward questions and if the victim is a journalist or a lawyer, it may attract uncomfortable international attention,&rdquo; Alan Rusbridger wrote in the report on the Kenyan scenario.&ldquo;Journalists in Kenya tell CPJ the country&rsquo;s political class are ensuring unhelpful coverage will be effectively penalised, that is, the money will dry up,&rdquo; the committee adds in a report that interviewed media industry key decision makers, serving and sacked journalists, analysts and the government.Quoting analyst David Makali the report says Jubilee censors journalists by co-opting journalists and intervening at the very inside using the state levers.
