The families of lawyer Willie Kimani, his client and driver yesterday put up a fight, justifying why they must have a say in the high -profile murder trial.&ldquo;We have already suffered the consequences of the crime and we are here to seek justice,&rdquo; they told trial judge Jesse Lessit.Responding to an application filed by the police officers who are on trial over the murder of Kimani, Josephat Mwenda and Joseph Muiruri, the families, through their lawyers, said gagging them will not only be unfair, but is unconstitutional.On Monday, Fredrick Leliman, Leonard Maina, Stephen Chebulet, Silvia Wanjiku and informer Peter Ngugi said their right to a fair trial is being violated.They said there is no provision in the law that allows cross-examination by other lawyers apart from the DPP.But yesterday, Lessit was told the cross-examination being conducted by victim lawyers has not supplanted the rights of the accused. &ldquo;The victims have come to this court to seek the truth, to speak for the dead and to demand accountability and justice,&rdquo; LSK lawyer Stephen Ongaro said.Their participation, the court further heard, has not prolonged the trial, increased the expenses or hindered the ability of the Director of Public Prosecutions to conduct a focussed trial.The LSK, which also objects to the application seeking to block cross examination by victims lawyers, said their members have been traumatised by the killing of their colleague.&ldquo;We sought to actively participate in this trial, not as a party, but to meaningfully effect our member&rsquo;s right under the Constitution&rdquo; Prof Ben Sihanya said. The lawyer said denying the victims an opportunity to cross-examine witnesses would negate the spirit of the Constitution.
