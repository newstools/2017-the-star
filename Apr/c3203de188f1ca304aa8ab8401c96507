Bungoma maize farmers are worried they will not get a good harvest thanks to the armyworm. Most do not have the money to buy pesticide to kill the dreaded pest and have resorted to use kerosene and home-made pesticide. The worm causes maize leaves to rot after burrowing them and eating the cobs. The worm has been reported in various parts, especially the country's grain basket areas. They have invaded Kwale, Trans Nzoia, Tongaren, Webuye West and Kimilili.This has raised fears of a dire food situation already made worse by the ongoing ravaging drought. Maize is the country's staple food. A spot check by the Star on Tuesday revealed massive damage in farms across Bungoma county.Robai Muyondo in Sango village, Webuye West constituency, who has planted two hectares ( 4.9 acres) of maize, said the worm spread to her farm from her neighbour. She said she has no idea how to kill the worm."I am appealing to the national government and the county to intervene and assist us get drugs to kill these worms, which have threatened to deny us a bumper harvest this year," she said.Muyondo took out a loan with one hectare ( 2.4 acres) as surety to plant when the rains first fell in February. She is now worried she might default if the crop fails.Faris Mbungu from Mayaso village, Kimilili, who has five hectares, said he went to his farm on Monday and found the maize leaves had shrunk. When he unfurled one he found an armyworm in it.Bilia Wamalwa from Sango said she had never seen the worm before but had heard of it on radio.She said she had expected to harvest 30 bags per hectare but as it is she will be lucky to get even 10.
