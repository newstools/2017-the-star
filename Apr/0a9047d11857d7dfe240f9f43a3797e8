There was confusion and claims of rigging during JP&rsquo;s nominations in Nyandarua on Friday.Apart from delays, voters&rsquo; names were missing from the party&rsquo;s register.In Charagita, Ol Joro Orok, only 600 ballot papers were provided yet the centre has 1,320 voters.Voters stormed out saying the vote had already been rigged.At Uiguano primary, in the same constituency, less than 2,000 ballot papers were availed yet the centre has more than 3,000 voters.Senator Muriuki Karue, who is eyeing the governor&rsquo;s position, said, &ldquo;this is &ldquo;open rigging, hence totally unacceptable&rdquo;. At Ol Kalou, governor aspirant Moses Kiarie-Badilishsa said a few days ago &ldquo;we were assured by the county election board that everything is okay. But now they have gone into hiding and switched off their phones.&rdquo;
