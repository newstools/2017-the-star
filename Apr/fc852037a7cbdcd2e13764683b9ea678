Budalang&rsquo;i MP Ababu Namwamba on Monday said he will lock out ODM in Busia county.He says he will ensure the party does not win any seat, including the MCA post.Speaking in Funyula, Ababu said a seven-member board, including himself, Busia Senator Amos Wako, Funyula MP Paul Otuoma, Engineer Dan Barasa, Humphrey Nakitare, Lucas Meso and Engineer Vincent Sidai have been urged to ensure ODM is locked out of the county.Ababu said, &ldquo;We will have one Luhya candidate to face Governor Sospeter Ojaamong at the General Election, whether ODM leader Raila Odinga will back him or not.&rdquo;&ldquo;Ojaamong must fall&rdquo;.Ababu told the Samia people he will support Otuoma&rsquo;s governor bid if they support President Uhuru Kenyatta.He dismissed the six-piece voting pattern that ODM advocates.However, when reached on the phone, Barasa dismissed the claims, saying he has no knowledge of the board set up to lock ODM out of Busia county.He said he would never be party to such arrangements.&ldquo;I am also prepared to battle it out for the governor ticket on the Jubilee Party ticket without anybody&rsquo;s support. I cannot step down for any other candidate,&rdquo; Barasa said.Sidai also dismissed Ababu&rsquo;s claims, saying he has not been approached to set up the team.&ldquo;I cannot be Otuoma&rsquo;s running mate. It is Otuoma who should be my running mate,&rdquo; he said.Wako also dismissed such plans.He said, &ldquo;I am in ODM and he is not in the Orange party. He should not drag me into matters I am not aware of.&rdquo;Meso and Nakitare could not be reached for comment.Namwamba has said he will back the President&rsquo;s reelection bid as he has addressed the concerns of his Budalang&rsquo;i constituents. The MP and Labour Party of Kenya leader cited President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s initiative to construct a bridge across River Nzoia.&ldquo;I can now confidently walk in Budalang&rsquo;i and tell my constituents that Uhuru has listened to their concerns and addressed them,&rdquo; Ababu said during an interview on Citizen TV in March.&ldquo;We are witnesses to the President&rsquo;s services and demeanour&hellip;he came to Budalang&rsquo;i and condoled with the families of those who died after a boat capsized and promised the bridge, which he has delivered.&rdquo;Ababu, who was once Raila&rsquo;s blue-eyed boy, said his people have every reason to support the President.&ldquo;If that is not performance, tell me what performance is,&rdquo; said the MP, who quit his ODM secretary general position saying Raila had frustrated him.The LPK boss said previous administrations failed to honour the promise of putting up the crucial bridge despite an avalanche of pleas from the people. Journalist-cum-politician David Makali was kicked out of Namwamba&rsquo;s Labour Party of Kenya over alleged links with ODM.Makali had been serving as the party&rsquo;s secretary general and is eyeing the Bungoma senate seat. The party&rsquo;s National Executive Council appointed organising secretary Peter ole Musei as acting secretary general.Youth treasurer Ignatius Nyukuri said Makali has been pushing Labour Party to join hands with NASA.&ldquo;A majority of NEC members are inclined to Jubilee; it&rsquo;s only Makali who has been pushing the party to work with NASA,&rdquo; he said.Ababu has in the recent past denied being funded by Uhuru&rsquo;s party.Nyukuri said Makali told a NEC meeting that he has had several meetings with Raila, who indicated his willingness to work with former ally Ababu. The council also faulted Makali for failing to popularise Labour Party even in his Bungoma backyard.
