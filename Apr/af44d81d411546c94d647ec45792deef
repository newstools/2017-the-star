Was it ironic for ODM leader Raila Odinga to term Jubilee Party&rsquo;s bungled nominations of a week ago a &ldquo;donkey&rsquo;s fart&rdquo;, or what? The JP leadership swiftly realised their blunders and rectified them to prove to Raila that his party&rsquo;s primaries were indeed the loudest donkey&rsquo;s fart. Open mismanagement of ODM nominations in Nyanza and other regions proved Raila wrong for mocking President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s JP. ODM nominations have been marred by chaos as rigged-out candidates and voters loudly protest the results. The ODM primaries saw rival candidates declare themselves winners and even returning officers issue them with certificates. For instance, many were left mouths agape when the victory of Bondo MP Gideon Ochanda was nullified and his rival Raila&rsquo;s elder brother Oburu Oginga (pictured) announced the winner.***** In any competition there are those who either celebrate with the winner or one&rsquo;s downfall. The hotly contested Jubilee Party nominations saw many big names fall, both in Rift Valley and Mt Kenya. Some senators who survived the axe, however, were heard celebrating the fall of MPs who have been frustrating the Senate&rsquo;s work. The senators allied to NASA and Jubilee particularly singled out Ainabkoi MP Samuel Chepkong&rsquo;a, who they said has been misusing his position as National Assembly Justice and Legal Affairs committee chairman.They celebrated Chepkong&rsquo;a&rsquo;s downfall and even told him to retire from politics for masterminding trouble in the country by coming up with controversial laws. They cited the contentious 2015 Security laws that were marred by chaos during their passage in the House. *****A former girlfriend of an MP from Uasin Gishu county who failed to secure the JP ticket in the just-concluded primaries has organised a huge ceremony to celebrate his defeat. According to those in the know, the city beauty, who has sired two children with the man, was dumped by the first-time MP soon after he won at the 2013 election. It is said the legislator, who may soon become jobless, has never set foot in the lady&rsquo;s house after the breakup. The lady is now said to be planning to sue the legislator who, before his debut in politics, used to hold a government office on Haile Selassie Avenue. *****Could there be plans by some people in ODM to assist some politicians to get nomination tickets, despite the possibility that they have have been floored in the party primaries? On Thursday one party&rsquo;s Elections Board issued a statement saying it will only recognise results transmitted to the Board by appointed Returning Officers and not their deputies or any other person. The board also announced the only results to be recognised will be those announced from recognised tallying centres.
