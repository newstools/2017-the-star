Police officers charged with the murder of lawyer Willie Kimani and two others are now trying to block the LSK, the IJM and litigators representing victims from cross-examining witnesses.The five suspects, who the Director of Public Prosecutions says hatched a plot to kill Kimani, his client Josephat Mwenda and driver Joseph Muiruri on June 23, 2016, yesterday put up a spirited fight. They said their right to a fair trial is being violated. In an application filed before trial judge Jesse Lessit, Fredrick Leliman, Leonard Maina, Stephen Chebulet, Sylvia Wanjiku and informer Peter Ngugi said there is no provision in the law that allows cross-examination by other lawyers apart from the DPP.&ldquo;In criminal proceedings, advocates watching brief have no locus standi (ability) to cross-examine witnesses at all,&rdquo; lawyer James Muchere stated in court papers. This comes after revelations linking yet another police officer to the killer suspects was introduced during cross-examination a fortnight ago. Lawyers watching brief for the family, the LSK and the International Justice Mission relied on Facebook chats and phone data records to prove Wilson Kamau, an officer attached to an undercover unit headed by Leliman, called Ngugi several times from June 23. Kamau had denied knowing Ngugi and when referred to the evidence, he asked to be heard in camera.
