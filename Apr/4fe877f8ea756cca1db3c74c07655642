As we approach the promisingly intriguing general election on August 8, we begin to realise that we&rsquo;re still a far cry from being a politically mature nation. We&rsquo;ve witnessed party elections for various positions, including nominations. marred by passionate scuffles, with many aspirants alleging fraud, favouritism and unfairness.We have played the role of a very captive audience to the dramatic shows displayed by both sides of the political divide &mdash; shows whose antagonist and protagonist roles vary from one speculator to another.Let&rsquo;s also not forget the blatant disregard for the Kenyan people&rsquo;s dignity by the political class in their unrelenting pursuit for power, especially in this reeking government of ours, Jubilee. What with investing tonnes of cash in their campaigns, instead of putting that very much needed money into more pressing issues such as hunger and security, yet we all know how bad things are.The opposition has made a declaration to the effect that they have the right to, and will establish a parallel tallying system to keep the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission in check.This is a clear indicator of the suspicion many have about the ability of the IEBC to conduct free and fair elections in August. Once beaten, twice shy. The bungled 2007 general election cost Raila Odinga the victory he so much deserved. In 2013, he sought the Supreme Court&rsquo;s intervention after the election results were tampered with in some polling centres.We know of two million voters who went to the polling stations and voted for no other candidate on the ballot other than the Jubilee presidential candidate. The dishonesty in the political world has given birth to a society that is slowly morphing into self-centeredness. Too many people are preoccupied with the wrong things, worshipping craft goddesses that bless only themselves.All these woes are not occasioned by nature because at least a catastrophic earthquake can&rsquo;t very much be some person&rsquo;s fault.We are exactly where we are as a disunited state only because of our actions of omission and commission.Yes, many factors have led to this form of society, where the democratic power has only come to vest in those elected, and not the electorate.We Kenyans have failed in one major task: The one task which, if not well performed, guarantees our doom in the end &mdash; upholding the rule of law.The Constitution today is no more than a powerful instrument used by the elitists to control the supposed sovereign state.One can blame Raila and the National Super Alliance for attempting to oppose the law of the land by seeking to usurp the powers of the IEBC, but any sensible Kenyan can and should by now understand why and how we&rsquo;ve come down to this.It&rsquo;s an open secret that Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho is now paying for the &ldquo;sin&rdquo; of &lsquo;offending&rsquo; President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto.Uhuru made it clear two weeks ago in Mombasa that he&rsquo;s not one to be messed with without consequences, and has since stayed true to his word, having had the various government agencies at his disposal make Joho&rsquo;s life a living hell.The biggest hindrance to the growth of this country today is the fact that the political field has always been a haven for individual self-growth, and our government is the biggest corporation that generates the most income and renders the lowest quality of services to the least demanding clientele.It is, however, irrefutable that any breed of leaders in any country is a direct result of the kind of citizens it has.We all have the eyes to see the callousness entrenched within our leaders, yet stand by them no matter what.We are fully cognisant of the misuse and abuse of power by various leaders, but often choose not to see the bad in them, however despicable.The Constitution, just like fire, can either be used for good or for evil.Now we&rsquo;re being scorched by the Constitution that is wielded by the wrong people.NASA&rsquo;s open disregard for the IEBC&rsquo;s ability to oversee the election should be a clear indicator of where we are as a nation.As we head towards August 8, questions continue to stack up in our heads as to how and what the turnout will be.A nation&rsquo;s placidity can only be maintained through mutual understanding, and as of now since the law can only work for the Jubilee government and no one else, the opposition, backed by a considerable number of Kenyans, has opted for alternatives to the Constitution. Truth be told: The Jubilee regime has done very little to even justify its quest for a second term.It&rsquo;s really quite amazing that the President successfully presented the State of the Nation address, given the fact that by his final year in his first term, living standards have gotten, and continue to get, worse. Things were better when he took power in 2013. Dear Kenyans, it is high time we started demanding a better Kenya for every one of us.The elitists who have ruled the country for decades with nothing significant to give in terms of service have had it easy at the expense of Kenyans who cannot deviate from the norm.We must focus on the values of leadership and integrity and abide strictly by those values when conferring power upon anyone.
