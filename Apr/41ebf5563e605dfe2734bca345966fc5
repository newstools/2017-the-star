Residents and leaders of Mandera county have called on the government to lift the dusk-to-dawn curfew during Ramadhan. Governor Ali Roba has asked Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery to lift the six-month-long curfew to allow Muslims to attend prayers and to improve business.Ramadhan starts on May 26. The curfew was first imposed after al Shabaab militants attacked Bishaaro Guest House in Mandera town, killing 12 people and seriously injuring six others. The attack took place on October 25, 2016.Last month, Nkaissery extended the order by three months. Initially, the curfew was from 6pm-6am, but after the extension it is now from 7pm and 5am&ldquo;The curfew has hit the people of Mandera hard,&rdquo; Roba (pictured) said. He was speaking during the launch of Jubilee Party campaigns in Mandera on Saturday. He was accompanied by Mandera West MP Mahamud Mohammed, Mandera North MP Adan Mohamed and Mandera South aspirant Adam Ali, among others. Residents say the order has hurt their businesses and the region&rsquo;s economy. A few days ago, the governor had welcomed the extension, saying the curfew has minimised terror attacks that have left many people dead and scores injured. Some residents call it punitive and illegal.
