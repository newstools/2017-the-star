Kitui Governor Julius Malombe has said he doubts whether Narc party leader Charity Ngilu is honest and genuine in being Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka&rsquo;s ally.&ldquo;Although she has drawn herself closer to Hon Kalonzo Musyoka and appears to have forged an alliance with the latter, the move does not appear to be genuine and Kalonzo must be very wary,&rdquo; Malombe said.&ldquo;Even her body language betrays her. If a Wiper branded cap is placed on her head, she swiftly pulls it away. It shows she is not genuine in the move she made to unite with Wiper and that is why her agenda is suspect.&rdquo;Malombe spoke on Friday in Ikutha market, Kitui South, when he commissioned the third Level IV hospital in Kitui county.The Sh106 million upgrade of Ikutha Hospital was financed by the county government.He said if Ngilu is ready to form a formidable alliance with Kalonzo and Wiper, she should follow the example of Makueni Governor Kibutha Kibwana of Muungano Party, who set his party aside and agreed to seek reelection on the Wiper ticket.Hardly two weeks ago, Ngilu, Kibwana and CCU&rsquo;s Wavinya Ndeti met Kalonzo and agreed to form an alliance. The leaders were unanimous that they would support Kalonzo in his quest to be the next president and push for him to be NASA&rsquo;s flagbearer.But Malombe said that Ngilu&rsquo;s intention to gravitate around Kalonzo was only meant to improve her chances of being elected Kitui governor.&ldquo;She is only out to use Kalonzo&rsquo;s name in a bid to clinch the governor&rsquo;s seat. She has a reputation of being a political turncoat,&rdquo; he said.Ngilu was unavailable for comment. She could not be reached on phone and she did not respond to a text message.
