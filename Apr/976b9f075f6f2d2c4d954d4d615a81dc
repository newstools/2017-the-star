The Senate Public Accounts and Investments Committee yesterday ordered the Auditor General to investigate further what happened to the Sh6 million that was not disclosed in Nyamira county&rsquo;s financial statements.Committee chairman Anyang&rsquo; Nyong&rsquo;o yesterday called for another audit.&ldquo;Pursue that account to establish how much was there, how the money has been expended and if the money was used for other things. Until we get the audit, you will be in trouble,&rdquo; he said when the committee grilled Nyamira Governor John Nyagarama at Parliament Buildings over the 2014-15 audit report.According to the Auditor General&rsquo;s report, the county had nil balances under tis deposits and retentions accounts. However, bank statements indicated Sh6 million was under the Nyamira County Project Retention Account at Cooperative Bank Ltd. Nyagarama told the committee the amount was being held in retention for contractors and &ldquo;was not reflected in the financial statements&rdquo;.He said his government has amended financial statements to reflect the amount in the 2015-16 financial year.&ldquo;This amount was held under Nyamira County Project Retention Account. This account was opened during the formation of the county government and we are in the process of transferring the account to the CBK as required by the law,&rdquo; he said. Senators Kimani Wamatangi (Kiambu), John Lonyangapuo (West Pokot), Liza Chelule (nominated) and Paul Njoroge asked why the cash had not been transferred a year later.
