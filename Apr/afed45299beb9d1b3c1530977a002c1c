Amani leader Musalia Mudavadi has urged Kenyans to accept any of the four NASA principals who is picked to fly the opposition flag on August 8.He said on Monday it would be wrong for any of their supporters to boycott the election if their preferred candidate is not the candidate.Mudavadi spoke in Khwisero, Kakamega county, where he endorsed ANC MP aspirant Christopher Aseka, popularly known as Miradi.He said, &ldquo;As NASA co-principals, we don&rsquo;t want to hear the Kambas say they will not vote if Kalonzo is not picked as the flagbearer, Luos say No Raila, No NASA, or Luhyas pressing to support Jubilee if Mudavadi or Wetang&rsquo;ula is not given the mantle.&rdquo;&ldquo;No single player from the European league, including Rooney, Messi, Ronaldo or Wanyama, can win a game if he plays alone against a bogus team. He must have a goalkeeper, defender, midfielder and striker. NASA has the four departments. We&rsquo;re sure of winning the poll.&rdquo;He said any NASA supporter who doesn&rsquo;t vote will help Jubilee win.Pray for me so I&rsquo;m picked to head NASA, he told residents.&ldquo;NASA is my brainchild and it&rsquo;s me who invited the other principals from ODM, Ford Kenya and Wiper because I knew none of us would topple President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto from power if each one contested alone,&rdquo; Mudavadi said.He said they resolved to stick together, regardless of the candidate, adding each of them is aware of the need to bring about change and none is ready to go it alone.Mudavadi described NASA as the victorious vessel capable of sending the Jubilee administration home.&ldquo;Choose wisely but remember ANC candidates as you cast your vote on August 8,&rdquo; he said.The former Vice President said the Jubilee administration is filled with liars who cannot be trusted to remain in power for another five years.&ldquo;In 2013, Uhuru, Ruto, Najib Balala and Chirau Mwakwere came to my house and said they had chosen me as their presidential candidate. We even signed an agreement before our lawyers and they left assuring me I was their preferred candidate,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;But after two weeks, they dishonoured the agreement and dismissed my candidature. They are liars who cannot be trusted with anything.&rdquo;Mudavadi reiterated NASA will have its own tallying centre parallel to the IEBC&rsquo;s. This will curb rigging, he said.He asked the IEBC to accept the opposition proposal, arguing that in 2013, the commission allowed TNA to have a parallel tallying centre.&ldquo;But after two weeks, they dishonoured the agreement and dismissed my candidature.
