The unveiling of flagbearer and campaign financing are some of the key issues to be discussed during the three-day NASA retreat.The leaders will also deliberate on how to share government posts among the four affiliate parties, as well as election management.The retreat will run from April 17 to 19. It will be attended by key allies only and members of the alliance&rsquo;s technical and coordinating committees.Sources familiar with the planning said the four principals have shifted their focus to sharing government posts after the NASA coordinating committee unanimously endorsed the presidential lineup.At the weekend, the NASA chiefs &ndash; Raila Odinga of ODM, Wiper&rsquo;s Kalonzo Musyoka, ANC&rsquo;s Musalia Mudavadi and Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula of Ford Kenya &ndash; met at Diani, South Coast.Details of their meeting remain scanty, but there are indications they met IT experts who will guide the alliance on a parallel tallying system. The IEBC has allowed the opposition alliance to operate a parallel tallying system on condition it is only for internal use. The NASA Coordinating Committee is said to have given an emphatic endorsement of a Raila-Kalonzo presidential ticketIt proposes Musalia be the Chief Minister and Wetang&rsquo;ula National Assembly Speaker.At the retreat, the four NASA captains are expected to agree on when to publicly unveil the lineup amid anxiety among supporters coupled with media leakages.&ldquo;This would be the only major retreat before the election. There are many issues to be discussed, including campaign financing and management of elections. If we don&rsquo;t plan how to protect the vote, all we are doing is in vain,&rdquo; a source familiar with the strategy told the Star.NASA is yet to begin publicly mobilising for campaign funding in their contest with Jubilee.In the last election, Raila held a series of fundraisers, including an exclusive Sh1 million a plate dinner.Jubilee is believed to have a massive war chest.There is possibility that political outfits will splash billions of shillings on the campaign trail after Parliament rejected spending limits set by the electoral commission.The IEBC had pegged presidential campaigns expenditure to a maximum of Sh5.2 billion.
