The power games between the Machakos leadership and Wiper were behind the delays in the Wiper primaries in the county yesterday.Returning officer Thomas Mausa told journalists the party had booked the County Social Hall for their operations, only for them to be denied access at the last minute.He said they intended to use the hall as a tallying centre and the point from which they would dispatch voting materials, but the county government officials refused to open the hall, causing the the delay.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why and don&rsquo;t want to guess, but the fact is that we were denied access,&rdquo; Mausa said.He said they had to operate from outside the hall, which resulted in unnecessary delays in sorting out the staff and dispersing materials to polling stations. Voting in most polling centres started at around 2.30pm.A county official told the Star that Wiper should have booked the hall a week in advance and paid the required fee, if they were serious about using it.Some residents blamed the problem on the long-running political differences between Governor Alfred Mutua and Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka.&ldquo;Governor Mutua should understand that this is a public facility and not his personal property. After August 8, we shall see whether he will be in a position to deny us access to the county facilities,&rdquo; one resident said.On Monday, Wiper cancelled the primaries for the position of governor, citing possible interference by Mutua&rsquo;s Maendeleo Chap Chap.But MCC, in a statement to newsrooms, dismissed the claims, terming them far-fetched.
