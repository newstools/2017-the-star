Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero has said he will not pay doctors who had taken part of the 100-day strike.He said doctors do not deserve the pay because they did not serve during the three-month strike that left hundreds of Kenyans suffering."How do you get paid when you haven't worked?" he said during a breakfast show on Citizen TV on Wednesday.The Governor said county governments should instead focus on using the resources from Treasury on other development and recurrent needs."The money we get from the national government isn&rsquo;t enough to pay salaries so even paying those who have not worked is out of the question," he added.
