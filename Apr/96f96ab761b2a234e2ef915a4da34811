Confusion, delays and uncertainty marked the ODM primaries in Kisumu county yesterday.There was no designated county tallying centre, even as voting got underway.There was a function at the venue the party had first identified.National Election Board secretary Bob Arunga told the press they still had time to identify the venue and would consult the elections team, party officials and aspirants.&ldquo;We will meet with the relevant stakeholders to come up with the county tallying centre somewhere that is safe and secure,&rdquo; he said.However, by press time they had yet to identify a centre. Sources said the party was turned away from venues in Kisumu town due to its history of chaos and destruction of property at the final tallying.By 7am, voting had not started in Kisumu Central and Kisumu East. Some constituencies received ballot boxes at 11am, despite residents turning up as early as 6.30am to vote.There was confusion over the register. Most residents who registered as voters last year were turned away by the clerks, who were using the 2013 IEBC register.Arunga, however clarified that they were using the party membership register and the IEBC 2013 register as they have not received the latest register of 2017. At Kosao Primary School, the ballot boxes had not arrived by 11am and the officials where nowhere to be seen. Meanwhile a few metres away at Manyatta Primary School voting was going on.Kisumu Central MP aspirant Richard Ogendo said somebody somewhere was &ldquo;sitting&rdquo; on the boxes.&ldquo;These people, as you can see, are angry, agitated and unhappy. The party should look into the matter before things get out of hand,&rdquo; he said. However, all was not doom and gloom as in some constituencies and subcounties voting went on smoothly without hitches.
