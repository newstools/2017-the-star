There are reasons to believe that the marriage between top video director Jibril Blessing and his wife Chantelle, real name Winnie Wambui Naisula Ole Siameto, has hit the rocks.For some time now, rumours have been doing rounds that the two are no longer together and that the Tokelezea hit maker had moved out of Blessing&rsquo;s house.Other sources intimated that Chantelle was having a thing with a well-known comic as the two would often be seen in each others&rsquo; company at social events.Word Is can now confirm that Blessing and his wife have parted ways. Sources close to the couple claim the split might have been caused by the sudden demise of their son Kyle in July 2015.On Thursday last week, Chantelle was at Club Privee in Westlands for Industry Nite. She was in the company of some celebrity friends and a certain lad by the name Erskine Kiliru.For those not in the know, the gentleman who was enjoying her company is said to be rich and often flaunts a lavish lifestyle on social media. Reports also indicate that he&rsquo;s happily married.After settling down and ordering drinks, Erskine and Chantelle &ndash; who dabbles as an actress &ndash; were seen getting cosy at the corner of the club.At some point, they locked lips briefly, clearly indicating she is back in the market after ending things with Blessing. Unless they are still together, which would mean she was cheating.Erskine and Chantelle would stand up and dance regularly before returning to their seats to have drinks and whisper sweet nothings into each other&rsquo;s ears. They left the club together around 2am.When reached for comment, Blessing said he can&rsquo;t comment on the story, adding that he is not the kind of person who sits down to talk about other people&rsquo;s affairs.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not involved in any way. Did you see me there? So, follow with the right people that you saw there. This is gossip and I&rsquo;m not the kind of person who sits down to talk about other people,&rdquo; he said.Neither Chantelle nor Erskine picked up their phones when reached for comment.
