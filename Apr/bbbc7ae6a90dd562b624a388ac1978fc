Mombasa senate aspirant Jabez Oduor has pleaded not guilty to charges of causing disturbance during Wiper primaries on Tuesday.Oduor was accused of causing the disturbance at Fahari primary school in Kizingo and obstructing a police officer from performing his duties.He denied the charges before senior principal magistrate Henry Nyakweba on Wednesday and was released on Sh100,000 bond.The politician reportedly obstructed Omar Fadhili from doing his work.State counsel Ngina Mutua did not oppose Oduor's release but urged the court to sternly warn him.Mutua said the politician cannot commit such offences as the political temperatures are high."This court should warn the accused that serious steps will be taken if he repeats the offence of causing disturbance," Mutua said.The case will be mentioned on May 8.Wiper officials called off nominations in parts of the county citing chaos.Read: Wiper chaos: Polls called off as plot alleged to pick candidatesAlso read: Wiper to ban aspirants involved in chaos during nominations - Senator Omar
