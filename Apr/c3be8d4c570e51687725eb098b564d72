An intimate and ultimately harrowing peek inside the world of amateur porn, &ldquo;Hot Girls Wanted&rdquo; will shock and outrage audiences in equal measure. Just maybe not in the numbers some might think, given the staggering statistics on how many people already view the scores of online clips that use naive young women as so much grist for the mill. Filmmakers Jill Bauer and Ronna Gradus adopt a slick but respectful approach, shrewdly playing the subject&rsquo;s titillating elements to their advantage. That could make the pic one of the year&rsquo;s hottest doc titles, a position that the film&rsquo;s considerable substance would duly reward.The documentary&rsquo;s revelations will come as an eye-opener for many parents, the kind that hopefully inspire frank and honest conversations with their kids. According to the film, any young woman with an Internet connection and a longing to escape her present situation can get into porn. It may sound extreme, but the filmmakers draw on their reporting backgrounds to build a potent case backing up the claim.In a point the film hits perhaps a bit too hard, when teen girls see celebs like Miley Cyrus and Nicki Minaj using their bodies to build their careers and &ldquo;break the Internet,&rdquo; it sends a pretty clear message. Vapid reality shows and &ldquo;celebrity&rdquo; sex tapes only add to the mainstreaming of porn culture.While Bauer and Gradus captured all the footage and interviews themselves, Brittany Huckabee&rsquo;s role as producer, writer and editor suggests she was equally instrumental in shaping the powerful final product. Kinsey researchers Debby Herbenick and Bryant Paul provide welcome context with factual information that appears onscreen at regular intervals. And producer Rashida Jones contributes an original song, &ldquo;Wanted to Be Loved&rdquo; (performed with Daniel Ahearn), a rare doc tune that doesn&rsquo;t feel gratuitous.
