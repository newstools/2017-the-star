Kenya&rsquo;s economy is projected to record a slower growth in 2017 due to general election jitters, prolonged drought and the after effects of the interest rates cap legislation, analysts at brokerage firm Genghis Capital projected yesterday.They said the economy will expand by between 4.6 per cent and 5.5 per cent helped by agriculture, manufacturing and transportation sectors.The firm, in its outlook report for 2017, said a further shrink in private sector expansion and lower yields is expected. &ldquo;Our projections are lower than the 2016 GDP (Gross Domestic Product) growth estimates mainly weighed down by protracted drought, a slowdown in the private credit sector growth and uncertainties relating to the August elections,&rdquo; head of research Elizabeth Wangechi said.The economy expanded by 5.7 per cent in the third quarter of 2016, a slight dip from the six per cent in quarter three of 2015.&ldquo;The retreat was due to stunted growth within agricultural, manufacturing, real estate and construction sectors,&rdquo; it noted on its report. Annual private sector credit growth dipped to 4.3 per cent as at December 2016 from 21.2 per cent registered in July 2015. The firm has attributed the drop to private sector crowding out effect in the third quarter of 2015 due to increased borrowing by the government.Genghis Capital has also projected a lower revenue collection for the next financial year, starting July 1, with the Kenya Revenue Authority expected to miss its target.KRA is expected to collect Sh1.70 trillion in ordinary revenues for the fiscal year 2017/18 up from Sh1.55 trillion in the current financial year .Genghis Capital CEO Geoffrey Gangla said the target was &ldquo;ambitious&rdquo;.&ldquo;The current financial year&rsquo;s half year data already shows a lagged collection of Sh591.17 billion versus pro-rated Sh 666.02 billion total tax income,&rdquo; he said.He added that the increased financing risks at the proposed Sh328.89 billion domestic borrowing exceeds the 60:40, external to domestic borrowing ratio (as approved under the medium term debt management strategy). On the Sub Saharan region, the report has forecast a rebound on GDP in 2017 and a 2.9 per cent growth from an estimated 1.4 per cent growth last year. This projection is pegged on economic prospects of the region&rsquo;s oil commodity producers and exporters.&ldquo;Growth in the emerging markets and developing economies is projected to show a 4.6 per cent expansion in 2017, up from the projected 4.2 per cent for 2016. The anticipated commodity fortunes coupled with diminishing risk in currency depreciation, is expected to engineer growth in the emerging market segment,&rdquo; the firm said in a statement yesterday.On January 31, the Central Bank downgraded Kenya&rsquo;s economic growth forecast to 5.7 per cent in 2017 from 5.9 per cent last year, citing uncertainties in the global economy amid a ravaging drought.
