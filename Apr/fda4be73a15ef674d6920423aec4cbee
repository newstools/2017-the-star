&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your biggest regret?&rdquo; Nabil asks me.I don&rsquo;t know what to say. My biggest regret? I have no idea. Everything I&rsquo;ve done so far has worked out pretty well for me. &ldquo;Well, in University I had the option of pursuing a degree in medicine or going into media. I chose the media. I regret that,&rdquo; I say. I&rsquo;m lying, of course. But I find that people treat you differently when they think you have a brain. Nabil looks suitably impressed and makes a cryptic comment.&ldquo;I think there will be bigger regrets than that,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Why do you say that?&rdquo; I ask sharply. He takes a drag of his shisha to avoid answering. He is saved from responding by the return of his brother and I forget about his comment. I am very, very drunk by now. &ldquo;Your phone is charging,&rdquo; he tells me. I nod. Another round of drinks come. It occurs to me that they are on soft stuff and I&rsquo;m the only one getting toasted but I keep going. Alcohol is interesting, especially when dealing with sober people. I keep repeating the same story to them and they nod and smile and say politely that I have shared this tonight. &ldquo;You told us already,&rdquo; Nabil says. &ldquo;Yes, but did I tell you this part?&rdquo; and I launch into the whole story over again. My voice is higher and I laugh a lot, launching into the same story for the fifth time. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to go,&rdquo; Nabil says with an indulgent smile. He pays the bill. We head towards the parking lot. &ldquo;Wait. My phone,&rdquo; I say.&ldquo;I have it right here,&rdquo; Nabil&rsquo;s brother says holding it up. &ldquo;Let me hang on to it, you may lose it,&rdquo; he says. I stumble into the car. I don&rsquo;t remember him going to pick it up after he left it charging. I must be really drunk. Nabil gets behind the driver&rsquo;s seat, his brother gets into the back and I ride up front. I put on my seat belt. &ldquo;Where do you live?&rdquo; Nabil asks. &ldquo;Why? Aren&rsquo;t we going to your place?&rdquo; I ask.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a little far from here,&rdquo; he responds. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want me to join you?&rdquo; I ask. I know he is married but Mr N told me he has a den for taking women. I assumed that was the plan all along. &ldquo;Where do you live?&rdquo; he asks again. &ldquo;South B,&rdquo; I say. &ldquo;Alone?&rdquo; he asks. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I respond.He nods, catching his brother&rsquo;s eye in the rear view mirror.&ldquo;We shall go to my place,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Like I said, it&rsquo;s a little far. Feel free to doze off.&rdquo;He is not kidding, we are still on the road 40 minutes later and the effects of the alcohol kick in and I pass out.When I wake up, I&rsquo;m not in the car. I&rsquo;m in a bare room on a small mattress with no covers. The floor is dirty and there is a musty smell in the room. It&rsquo;s cold. And dark. Shivering, I stand up to look for a light. I run my fingers along the wall and come across a switch. Light fills the room as I turn it on. Where am I? I head to the door. It&rsquo;s locked. What&rsquo;s going on? I try and remember where I was last night. I can&rsquo;t think clearly. I&rsquo;m so thirsty. There&rsquo;s nothing to drink in the room. There is a small window but it&rsquo;s very high up and I can&rsquo;t reach it. I start to panic. What&rsquo;s going on? My bag is on the floor and I grab it, trying to find my phone. It&rsquo;s not in there. Neither is my wallet. Just some lipstick and a book I have been reading.
