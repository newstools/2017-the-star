ODM leader Raila Odinga should be the opposition alliance flagbearer as he is the most preferred and best suited candidate to take on President Uhuru Kenyatta in the election, Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi has said.Speaking in Kibarani ward during a tour of development projects on Monday, Kingi expressed optimism that the coalition will remain united, regardless of who will be chosen as its candidate.The four NASA principals &mdash; Raila, Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper), Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula (Ford Kenya) and Musalia Mudavadi (ANC) &mdash; have been meeting to settle on one candidate, but they have not reached a consensus.When he opened Wiper offices in Kikambala on Monday, Kalonzo said their Sunday talks at Vipingo Ridge were mainly to strategise on how to send the Jubilee administration home rather than to select a flagbearer.The governor expressed optimism that Raila would win if he runs for election. &ldquo;Even if we go by the recent polls, Odinga is always at the top among the other three principals. This is a clear indication that he has the majority support and hence best fit to battle with President Uhuru Kenyatta,&rdquo; Kingi said.
