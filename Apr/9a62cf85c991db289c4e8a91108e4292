Pollsters are on the spot over inaccurate predictions after voters picked governor aspirants surveys indicated were trailing.Results presented by polling firms have raised questions about the surveys&rsquo; accuracy and whether the public will trust them again.Also brought to question is the firms&rsquo; independence from external influence by powerful and wealthy politicians, some of whom have previously accused pollsters of working for their opponents. &ldquo;There are so many polls being produced by partisan pollsters. Sometimes it is really hard for Kenyans to believe them,&rdquo; political analyst Justus Onwong&rsquo;a said.Opinion polls by Infotrak and Trends and Insights For Africa showed all incumbent governors would easily retain their seats. The firms forecasted that incumbent governors were leading their opponents with large margins.The outcome of the party primaries indicates otherwise.The latest opinion polls released by Infotrak projected that Kisumu Governor Jack Ranguma would be reelected by 58.7 per cent of voters against Senator Anyang&rsquo; Nyong&rsquo;o&rsquo;s 8.9 per cent.The poll was conducted between March 31 and April 2, a few days before of the ODM primaries began.But Nyong&rsquo;o, who is also the Kisumu senator, beat Ranguma on Tuesday after garnering 164,110 votes. Ranguma garnered 96,480 votes.The pollster also placed Kiambu Governor William Kabogo ahead of his opponent and Kabete MP Ferdinand Waititu.Kabogo had a 48.9 per cent approval rating, followed by Waititu with 31.8 per cent.Pollster Tifa placed Kabogo at 46 per cent and Waititu at 33 per cent. But in Tuesday&rsquo;s Jubilee primaries, Waititu beat Kabogo.In Nandi county, Tifa placed former Cabinet minister Henry Kosgey at the top with 36 per cent support, followed by former Agriculture CS Felix Koskei at 21 per cent.Incumbent Governor Cleophas Lagat came a distant third with 18 per cent. Interestingly, Senator Stephen Sang, who won the Jubilee ticket, was not included in the polls.In Nairobi a survey by infotrak put former Gatanga MP Peter Kenneth&rsquo;s popularity at 20.2 per cent, about three per cent shy of Senator Mike Sonko&rsquo;s support base. The poll conducted between March 18 and 19 indicated that Sonko would get 23 per cent of the Nairobi vote.
