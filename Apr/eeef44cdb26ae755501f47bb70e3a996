Jubilee Party supporters should maintain peace during the Friday primaries as the party is peaceful and law-abiding, Kiambu Governor William Kabogo has said.Speaking in Thika at the Governor&rsquo;s Easter Tournament, Kabogo said, &ldquo;I urge everyone who is registered as a voter to show up in big numbers knowing that the kind of leader you elect today will have an effect on your life for the next several years. So make a wise decision.&rdquo;Kiambu remains one of the Jubilee counties where nominations are expected to be hotly contested. Kabogo will be facing United for Kiambu group whose members include Kabete MP Ferdinand Waititu, James Nyoro, Francis Mugwe, Aquiline Njoki and Rev David Kariuki Ngari, popularly known as Gakuyo.The governor said his opponents do not have an agenda for Kiambu and only want a power sharing deal that he likened to NASA.Kabogo said he wants to be reelected to complete the development projects he initiated.He said the recent opinion polls that put him ahead of his opponents are a clear indication that Kiambu has decided.The governor said he is confident the nominations will be free and fair and cautioned aspirants from inciting voters.Kabogo also urged Kiambu residents to shun divisive politics.&ldquo;Elections come and go and we should all push for peaceful campaigns and not tolerate any form of violence,&rdquo; he said.Kenyans should take more interest in government projects to ensure they understand development projects, the governor said.Kabogo said people are being swayed by the opposition through emotional rhetoric that blinds them to growth.&ldquo;In the last four years, our nation has grown in bigger ways than we can tell. But I urge my fellow citizens to focus on following government projects and not the noise made by opposition politicians,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;For instance, the opposition have complained in the last four years about the government taking loans but we all know that for growth and development to take place then issues like loans must be part of the process.&rdquo;
