Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto, a proposed deputy premier secretary in the NASA administration, yesterday said he erred by supporting Jubilee at the 2013 polls.The politician was at the heart of the Jubilee campaigns in the lead-up to the 2013 polls that defeated the now-defunct Cord.Rutto will become the Deputy Premier Secretary in charge of the State Department of Devolution and Planning, Finance and the National Treasury, should NASA win the August 8 polls.The firebrand politician and vicious critic of the Jubilee administration said he had learnt his lessons and will rally the Rift Valley bloc to vote for the opposition on August 8.&ldquo;I erred by supporting this Jubilee. We thought we had formed a government of the people but when they took power they marshalled a tyranny of numbers and started oppressing Kenyans,&rdquo; Rutto said at the Uhuru Park rally. The Chama Cha Mashinani leader urged Kenyans to embrace the NASA movement and vote out Jubilee, which he accused of corruption, entrenched tribalism and blatant theft of public funds.He said while the initial Jubilee dream was to ensure social justice and equity for all Kenyans, it was unfortunate that the top leadership subsequently plunged the country into hopelessness. &ldquo;They have stolen everything, they have stashed the wealth abroad and have made Kenyans paupers in their own country,&rdquo; he added.Speaking second after Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula, Rutto said Kenyans are poised for the opportunity to &ldquo;return the country back to the real Kenyans away from the barons&rdquo;.&ldquo;We must liberate this country to ensure that we are led by policies of justice and equality. All Kenyans are equal and deserve to live in dignity,&rdquo; he said.Firing a ferocious salvo at President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto, the Bomet governor said the duo will lose the August polls to NASA.
