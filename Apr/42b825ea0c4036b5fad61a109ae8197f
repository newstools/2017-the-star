The now infamous negotiated democracy in Northeastern where clan elders pick candidates has locked out women hopefuls.All the clans apply the practice. It works against women who want to run for election.It&rsquo;s an uphill task for single, unmarried women who are insulted for considering politics.Kenya Women Holding project manager Margaret Mbugua said negotiated democracy is one impediment to women eyeing political seats.She addressed the press in Garissa town on Thursday after a two-day workshop for women aspirants.&ldquo;The elders don&rsquo;t recognise the role of women in leadership,&rdquo; Mbugua said.Mbugua said, &ldquo;Elders, through the so-called negotiated democracy, have only reserved political seats for men. This has negatively impacted women seeking posts.&rdquo;She said unlike other parts of the country where women are coming out to seek posts, including those of governors, MPs, Senate and MCAs, in Northeastern, women have no chance. The manager said culture and religion have become an obstacle to women politicians as they are locked out of leadership. Mahfudho Haji will run for Adamasija MCA in Wajir county.Although Haji struggles to present her manifesto and agenda, she perseeres.&ldquo;Being a woman in itself is a challenge as elders will rally behind people to reject you for defying them. I have told them [elders] to only engage in other activities such as bringing cohesion among communities and leave politics to politicians,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;I believe the people will vote for me because of what I have achieved as a community leader, not because of my gender,&rdquo; the ODM candidate said.
