An nine-year-old export ban on cashew nuts has led to a total collapse of farming in Lamu county, farmers say.The ban, imposed in 2009 by then Agriculture minister William Ruto, forbade farmers from exporting and selling the crop to outside markets to revive local industries.Only the National Cereals and Produce Board has the authority to buy raw nuts from the farmers.Farmers in major nut growing area such as Mpeketoni, Witu and Faza have incurred huge losses have slowly abandoned the crop and embarked on other ventures as they no longer have a ready market for their produce.Area MP Julius Ndegwa, who previously used to grow the crop on a large scale, said farmers have been demoralised and the damage caused by the ban will take long to be undone.Speaking in Mpeketoni, he said shortly after the ban, many farmers who had stocked up their stores with cashew nuts encountered huge losses as they were unable to sell the tonnes of cashew nuts they had. As a result, a huge percentage of the produce was destroyed.The MP urged the government to lift the ban to revive cashew nut farming, which will improve residents' lives.Many farmers uprooted their cashew nut trees.&ldquo;The ban has totally killed the cashew nut industry and it was doing so well before that. Nine years is a long time but there is still a chance that it might do well with the ban lifted. When people go to the extent of uprooting cashew nut trees then you know people have really lost hope. The ban has totally closed up all market doors,&rdquo; Ndegwa said.Lamu has well more than 10,000 cashew nut farmers.Some farmers have however been able to preserve some of the produce in their stores and are hopeful that if the ban if lifted, they will be able to sell at good prices.
