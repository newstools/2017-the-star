Poor leadership, lack of development and no accountability made voters reject Nyeri incumbents. Voters interviewed said the county government has been rated the worst in the country because of feuds between the assembly and the executive. MCAs fought the late Governor Nderitu Gachagua for four years, neglecting development. Voters showed their frustration at the ballot.&ldquo;Most leaders were out of touch with residents. They went to Nairobi immediately they were elected,&rdquo; commentator James Karimi said. MPs were also accused of misusing CDF cash and using it as a campaign tool. Wambugu Nyamu, who was vying for the Nyeri Senate seat but opted out at the last minute, said, &ldquo;This was widely expected because Nyeri voters were hopeless. They needed a change of leadership.&rdquo;
