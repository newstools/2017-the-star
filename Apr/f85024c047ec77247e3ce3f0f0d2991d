Youths have started a project to rehabilitate the Aberdare Forest, a major water tower, by planting 1,000 trees.The youths are affiliated to the Lieuten Green Movement. They planted the trees in Wanjerere and Gatare blocs of the Aberdare Forest. The youths planted trees in areas hit by mudslides and left bare.Led by environmentalist Isaac Karoga, they engaged schoolchildren from Tuthu village in Kangema in the drive on Tuesday. Karoga urged residents and organisations to partner with them. &ldquo;We decided to take advantage of the rains to reverse the effects of logging and the prolonged drought in the forest,&rdquo; he said.Felix Ochieng from Kariobangi estate in Nairobi said, &ldquo;As youths from Nairobi, we got concerned with the acute water shortage and we decided to come and help rehabilitate the forest.&rdquo; He said it is unfortunate that some taps are dry in Nairobi due to the destruction of the forest.Murang&rsquo;a county commissioner John Elungata praised the youth for their initiative.&ldquo;It is encouraging the youth have committed their time to plant trees for the future generations,&rdquo; he said.
