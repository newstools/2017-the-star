Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka yesterday sought to downplay fears among his supporters that he may well have got a raw deal in the NASA agreement.&ldquo;I said, &lsquo;do I bite the bullet, or do I not?&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;Kenya is bigger than anybody else&rsquo;,&rdquo; Kalonzo said.Addressing NASA supporters in Uhuru Park, Kalonzo, whose party had insisted that he be named the NASA presidential flagbearer, explained that his interest is to fight for the dignity of Kenyans.&ldquo;I said I am prepared even to be a sweeper in a NASA government, provided Kenyans get their own dignity&rdquo;, he told the mammoth crowd.Kalonzo will be opposition chief Raila Odinga's running mate at the August 8 polls.Drawing analogies from his poverty stricken background at his parents&rsquo; Tseikuru home, Kalonzo told the tens of thousands of NASA supporters that what matters to him is the eventual success in forming a government that will eradicate poverty.The Wiper leader assured his supporters this time the opposition pact would be made public to avert the betrayal of previous MoUs.The MoU spells out the sharing of power in the NASA government.Recalling the 2002 MoU in which the Narc Summit members agreed on how to share power, Kalonzo said this time round the five principals had committed themselves to honouring the pact.Fifteen years ago, President Mwai Kibaki was accused of trashing the Narc MoU immediately after taking office.Kalonzo said the MoU was killed because it was not deposited with the Registrar of Political Parties, the custodian of political agreements.&ldquo;There have been broken MoUs, this round what we have agreed is signed and our secretaries-generals have deposited it with the Registrar of Political parties,&rdquo; he told the crowd to roaring applause.&ldquo;It is a public document, this not just another failed MoU, no more political gerrymandering, no political deceit&rdquo;, he added.
