She spoke to the press in Kenol town. She said, &ldquo;Failure to ensure credibility of the nominations and poor management of the whole exercise created loopholes for rigging.&ldquo;The party has failed aspirants and voters, especially the elderly. Most of our resources and confidence went to waste when the primaries were cancelled.&ldquo;The Jubilee Party must be prepared well even if it means they get more time to prepare to avoid what was witnessed on Friday.&rdquo;Wahome wants voter registers verified and authenticated to ensure every eligible voter, including those who listed in the recent mass voter registration, participates.She told the party to take full responsibility for the expenses contestants incurred on Friday.&ldquo;People were disheartened to find their names missing, despite travelling from far places to vote for leaders of their choice. I know Jubilee upholds democracy. Therefore, the party must ensure voters enjoy their democratic right and space to elect their preferred leaders,&rdquo; she added.The legislator said the problems and electoral malpractices experienced should not be repeated if JP is keen to maintain its support base.&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to see inexperienced and untrained staff, clerks and presiding officers. These officials made no efforts to address the concerns raised by voters who had taken their time, resources and effort to participate in the polls,&rdquo; she said, adding that some clerks and presiding officers in Kandara were recruited by her rivals.
