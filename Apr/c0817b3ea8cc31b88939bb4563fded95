A commercial court has ordered an airline agent to pay a Nairobi businesswoman Sh1.8 million in damages for cancelling her business trip.Agnes Kariuki filed a civil suit in August 2014, against defendants Michael Kamau, Nyalori Stephen and Uniglobe Northline Travel Ltd, claiming compensation for inconvenience.Kariuki said she needed compensation for damages for breach of contract, damages for breach of statutory duty costs of the suit and interest.After filing the law suit, Kamau and Nyalori asked the court to dismiss the suit with costs. They denied the charges.Kariuki, however, testified in court on how she was introduced to the defendants and she bought a Sh 50,300 air ticket to Bujumbura, Rwanda, via M-Pesa. Kariuki said she was to travel on June 1, 2014. She said a confirmation was sent and she prepared to travel.On Friday, senior resident magistrate Peter Muholi said Kariuki went to the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, but was informed the booking had been cancelled by the defendants and she could not travel.Kariuki was meant to attend a business meeting, where she was a guest speaker at a congregation of Kenyans working in Bujumbura. She said failure to travel meant her employer lost potential business.The money she had paid for the ticket was later sent back to her, but she said the failure to buy an air ticket meant that she lost business.Muholi awarded Kariuki Sh900,000 for breach of contract and Sh900,000 for general damages for the loss.
