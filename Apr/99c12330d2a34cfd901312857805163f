COTU Secretary General Francis Atwoli has asked the government to ensure that rising standards of living are addressed during Labour Day celebrations on May 1.Atwoli said the President should ensure he addresses the needs of the workers before he asks for their votes."We will show up for the Labour Day celebrations ready to receive what President Uhuru Kenyatta has for us, but he should know that we have problems. We will make our decisions depending on what we are offered," Atwoli said.Atwoli was addressing shop stewards at the COTU headquarters, Solidarity House in Gikomba on Sunday.He said both the government and the opposition do not have a clear blueprint on how to salvage the country's economy."We all know that the current crop of leaders are just aligning themselves to political vehicles for re-election and not for the well being of the people, but one day this will change," he said.Last year the government did not raise the minimum wage for workers.Atwoli accused Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero of allegedly not delivering as expected by the people of Nairobi."We have grown up with the Governor and when Kidero was seeking for votes he saw the situation of the roads but till now as he seeks election the roads are still pathetic," Atwoli stated.Atwoli called on Kenyans to ensure the elections are peaceful and that they vote for leaders who are ready to serve and address their needs."We have some leaders in the country who have good deeds and thoughts of Kenyans and i cannot tell anyone who to vote for, but i urge us all to vote for those who have interests of the workers at heart," Atwoli said.Read: Declare 40 per cent wage hike on Labour Day, workers tell Uhuru
