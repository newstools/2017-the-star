Hoteliers in Naivasha and Nakuru have expressed concern over low bookings over the Easter season. Crayfish CEO Peter Mehta said this years&rsquo; bookings were low compared to last year, adding that the ongoing campaigns could have affected the sector. Mehta said the harsh economic times and election anxiety has affected business but was optimistic that things would change. He noted that Naivasha continues to attract a higher number of tourists compared to Mombasa due to the improved security and high number of hotels. At Heritage resort, manager Stephen Njuguna said the facility had recorded 40 per cent booking. He said the upcoming elections could have played a part in the low number of visitors to the town. Njuguna termed last year as better compared to this year. &ldquo;A lot of money and attention has gone on to the ongoing party nominations and this has adversely affected the hospitality sector,&rdquo; he said. Security in and around Naivasha was intensified during the Easter holidays. Officers from the prisons department have been incorporated in the normal patrols around major hotels and installations in and around the town. Naivasha sub-county deputy county commissioner Isaac Masinde said the move was to ensure adequate security is provided to holiday makers. &ldquo;We are not taking chances and we have intensified our patrols.&rdquo;
