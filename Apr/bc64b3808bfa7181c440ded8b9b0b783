THAT the IEBC commissioners have yet to settle in office is no secret. What is worrying though is that some of them haven't a clue what is going on in the commission. Some managers are deliberately hiding information from them and running rings around the new team led by Wafula Chebukati. We are told that some managers are even planning to transfer people they do not like and have vowed that not even the chairman will stop them from executing their agenda!****************HOW could a deputy governor say his county has "failed terribly" in delivering services to residents, yet he is part and parcel of the county administration? Right, this is one of the questions Isiolo residents are seeking answers to from their Deputy Governor Mohamed Gulleid after he accused the county leadership of failing residents. Word has it that Gulleid, who has been at loggerheads with his boss Godana Doyo since 2013, termed the deputy governor's position in the country a "flower girl" job. It is said he also termed the county administration "extremely corrupt", despite pocketing huge sums of taxpayers' money every month as the county's second-in-command. Shockingly, Gulleid gave the county leadership's performance three marks out of 10 in terms of service delivery. A question that Corridors and residents want answered is, Why hasn't he resigned from the corrupt administration, despite declaring to unseat his boss at the August polls?*************RAILA Odinga's ODM move to give direct nominations to some sitting MPs and governors has left many people with more questions than answers. They wonder how, for example, no female aspirant expressed her interest in unseating Homa Bay woman representative Gladys Wanga, leading to her direct nomination? Answers are particularly sought on whether other aspirants developed cold feet and quit the race because incumbents hold big party positions and are at the centre of power. Questions are also raised on whether the party long ago decided to give direct nomination certificates to loyal and firm members such Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho,who have resisted Jubilee's persistent four-year courting. *******YESTERDAY we carried an item to the effect that the Meru County Assembly had hired someone who was not qualified. The county responded: "As the head of HR Department, I wish to state that after the interviews for office of deputy clerk conducted on 27th March, 2017, the Board has never had time to sit and deliberate on the result until today. The winner in the interview has been picked for the job. The allegations that the HR Department was instructed to write and deliver a letter to number three at middle of the night is totally untrue. The County Assembly has always maintained integrity in its dealings and the report is aimed at tarnishing its good name".
