Kalenjin elders have criticised Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago and Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter for leading hundreds of youth to perform a cultural ritual on the streets of Eldoret town to protest against alleged rigging of Jubilee Party nominations.The protest amounted to a war cry.The ritual involved all those present squatting on the streets and uttering an oath and it caused panic among some residents, many of whom ran away for fear of violence.Video clips of the ritual went viral on social media, sparking intense debate. It was performed on Wednesday and Friday.There was tension in Eldoret town, which led to an emergency security meeting chaired by county commissioner Abdi Hassan after some leaders and residents said the ceremony amounted to incitement.First to condemn the governor and the MP was governor aspirant Bundotich Kiprop, popularly known as Buzeki, who has demanded that Mandago and those involved apologise for carrying it out in public.&ldquo;It was embarrassing and unacceptable within the Kalenjin community to do such a cultural ritual publicly on the streets yet it&rsquo;s clear when, where and how it should be done,&rdquo; he said.Buzeki said the ritual caused panic.Mzee Kibet Maswai, 86, says performing the ritual in such a manner is an abomination. &ldquo;These young people got it all wrong and as elders we were caught by surprise and we have asked the leaders involved to desist from ever doing it that way again,&rdquo; he said.Maswai said the ceremony, known as Cheptilet, can only be done in sacred areas selected by elders who lead the event, not just anyone.During the ceremony those present squat and sing songs led by a soloist who should be an elder, he said.On Friday, Mandago and Keter addressed residents from the roofs of their cars and squatted in the vehicles.&ldquo;There are several songs that can be used during the ritual and the songs are used to mobilise, motivate, warn or cement unity within the community because of impending enmity or to call for peace during crisis and also warn the community of betrayers within,&rdquo; Maswai said.Elders said the ceremony is not supposed to be done in the presence of children and women and it cannot be done in areas with diverse communities such as in a town.Elder Paul Kurgat said there was no need for such a ritual as Mandago&rsquo;s team was dealing with political issues, which do not endanger their culture or community. &ldquo;It is elders who decide when such a ritual is to be done and how. What they did was wrong and even calls for cleansing,&rdquo; he said.But elder Ben Kiplagat said the ritual was of no consequence and was done only as a way for those present to vent out their emotions. &ldquo;Whenever Kalenjins are emotional they will sing certain songs to encourage themselves and that is what happened. It was not meant to harm anyone,&rdquo; he said.Mandago&rsquo;s spokesman Silas Tarus dismissed critics of the ritual, saying they are trying to create a mountain out of nothing.
