With former five-time world cross country champion Paul Tergat having sailed through unposed as the National Olympic Committee of Kenya president, the race for the rest of the positions remain a cut-throat contest ahead of the May 5 elections.Incumbent president Kipchoge Keino, who was Tergat&rsquo;s sole challenger, was ruled out, after he failed to present his nomination papers to the electoral body&mdash;Centre for Multi-Party Democracy (CMD). And with the Nock executive having lost their voting powers during a reform process spearheaded by the International Olympic Committee, the elections will serve as one of the most open in the history of the Committee.Of interest is the deputy treasurer&rsquo;s seat, where incumbent Stephen Soi is facing three other candidates including Charles Mose (Kenya Cycling Federation), Paul Rwambo (Kenya Golf Union) and John Kameta (Boxing Association of Kenya). Current first vice chairman Ben Ekumbo, has also opted out of the race and will not defend his seat.Kenya Hockey Union chairman Nahashon Randiek faces Kenya Judo Association president, Shadrack Maluki for the position of first deputy president, thanks to the exit of Ekumbo. Kenya Volleyball Federation (KVF) chairman, Waithaka Kioni is up against his Athletics Kenya counterpart Lt (Rtd) Gen Jackson Tuwei in the race for the second deputy president.Secretary general&rsquo;s seat holder FK Paul, remains the front-runner in the hunt to retain his seat where he faces Kenya Table Tennis Association chairman Andrew Mudibo and Kenya Rugby Union director, John Kilonzo. The deputy secretary general position has attracted four candidates including incumbent James Chacha, John Ogola (Kenya Weightlifting Association), Francis Mutuku (Tennis Kenya) and Timothy Nabea (Football Kenya Federation).With current treasurer, Fridah Shiroya, also following kipchoge and Ekumbo out the door, the position now will be a hotly contested affair between Elynah Shiveka, Anthony Kariuki and Anna Njambi. Five candidates have thrown their hat into the ring for the executive committee members&rsquo; slots including Julius Mwangi of Kenya Cycling Federation, Suleiman Kanyanya (Kenya Taekwondo Association), Paul Otula (Kenya Basketball Federation), Mohammed Shoiab (Kenya Sports Shooting Federation) and four-time Boston marathon champion Catherine Ndereba.Two-time New York marathon champion Tegla Loroupe headlines the race for the women&rsquo;s representative position alongside Tennis Kenya&rsquo;s Paurvi Rawal and Roselyn Njeri of KSF. Former Kenya Sevens skipper, Humphrey Kayange and Olympic silver 5,000 meter medallist, Helen Obiri were the only candidates for the athletes&rsquo; representatives seats hence assumed the roles unopposed.
