As Kenya&rsquo;s head of state, President Uhuru Kenyatta always makes news. Lately, he has been criticised for constantly addressing the public in his vernacular language. Those disapproving this trend have reminded us that he is the President of 43 nations, including the Makonde, and should, therefore, speak in the language(s) that all these people can understand. Let us therefore unpack why the President and other politicians make this advertent linguistic choice. A choice that has been portrayed as ill advised. The human brain has two systems &mdash; the rational and the emotional. To comprehend how the two systems work concertedly, visualise yourself going on a journey riding an elephant. As the rider, you represent the rational system. You plan, analyse, make decisions, solve problems and control your thoughts and actions. The elephant represents the emotional system. He is unpredictable, irrational, erratic, mechanical and is the energy and drive (J Haidt).Often, the elephant will follow the rider&rsquo;s directions. When the rider pulls the reins, it communicates to the elephant which direction to turn, to stop or to proceed. However, there are times when the elephant defies the rider&rsquo;s instructions. The rider then tries to coax the elephant, drag it or push it to continue with the journey. Unfortunately, the weight imbalance accords the elephant a six tonne advantage over the rider. This renders the rider powerless. To cajole the elephant to cooperate, the rider resorts to tapping into his emotions and doing whatever is necessary along the path to allow for easy progress. To apply this analogy to our democratic reality come election season, our politicians are the riders. We, the voters, are the elephant. It would therefore be foolhardy for the rider to think that they can overpower the elephant. It has been said that politics is the art of persuasion. The Greek philosopher Aristotle, framed this best when he postulated that there are three appeals of persuasion; ethos, pathos and logos. Every intelligent politician knows that in order to persuade your audience that your thesis is valid and makes the most sense, your discourse needs to engage them using a dominant triad but interspersed with the other two. The intention is two-fold: One, to solidify or sway the audience&rsquo;s opinion, and two, to make the audience act in the speaker&rsquo;s favour. Let us now examine how President Uhuru has deliberately applied this triad.Logos is persuasion by use of reasoning. This includes critical cognition, analytical skills, good memory and purposeful behaviour. When the President gives a State of the Nation address or the keynote speech during a public holiday, he largely employs logos. He chooses to appeal to his audience&rsquo;s logic by offering credible evidence and facts to support his remarks. In this address, he amplifies his government&rsquo;s achievements by articulating examples of the projects and initiatives undertaken, authoritatively backing it up using statistical presentations, and provides an analysis of projected benefits likely to be realised or currently being enjoyed by the citizens. In using logos persuasion, his personal presentation is always purposeful. It is choreographed to include when to pause, when to make eye contact, when to be humorous, and when to speak off the cuff. His attire also portrays a seriousness, which befits this art of persuasion. To persuade an even wider audience, his government has launched the national public information portal that visually portrays investments and achievements over the last four years. Pictures, they say, are worth a thousand words and hence can be quite persuasive. This is why they have ingeniously chosen to portray a contrast of before and after milestones using black and white, and coloured pictures, respectively. Successful marketers will tell you that a sale is not made only through presentation of facts and logic. These only succeed in changing somebody&rsquo;s mind when your audience demands them. That is why using the ethos as the dominant triad is just as important. The ethos appeal involves convincing your audience that you can be trusted. This triad of persuasion attempts to show the speaker as fair, concerned and reliable. The intention of the speaker is to earn the audience&rsquo;s faith. To earn this trust, the speaker must offer an argument that is deemed credible. Recently when President Uhuru was campaigning in Narok, he paraded several Maasai professionals that hold prominent positions in his government. The intention was to gain the credence of the Maasai community, by showing them that he is a politician that could be trusted to secure the community&rsquo;s interests. This ethos appeal was echoed by Johnson ole Nchoe, the chief executive of Geothermal Development Company, when he spoke on behalf of those present, saying he did not understand why the community was still entertaining the opposition despite the President rewarding them by appointing their sons to key government positions. Similarly, this is the persuasive triad that the President is using in enlisting wealthy businessmen, professionals and government officials to drive his reelection campaigns in regions perceived to be NASA strongholds. Finally, pathos seeks to engage an audience emotionally. When speakers use pathos as the predominant triad, they carefully choose words that carry appropriate connotations. The speakers use pathos to sway their audience to their desirable emotional action. Their intention is to kindle passions that enlist their support. And what better way to ignite emotions than with your own, whom you share a cultural identity with. Culture has a profound impact on how people display, perceive and experience emotions. And knowledge of how people culturally react to certain paradigms, equips the speaker with oral ammunition on how to persuade them (Haviland and Malatesta). The reality is that culture precedes politics. Visually presented, culture is the dog and politics is its tail. And the dog wags the tail. This is why politics can only do what the culture allows it to. And this, ladies and gentlemen, is precisely why President Uhuru addresses his elephant in Kikuyu. And this is smart politics.
