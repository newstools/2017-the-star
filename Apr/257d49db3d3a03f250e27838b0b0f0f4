You are not going to speak about education as though no one else has ever made an effort,&rdquo; he said.On Thursday, Omar described Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho as a &ldquo;dead horse&rdquo;. He said NASA will prosecute Joho over the school certificate forgery allegations if it forms the next government. Lewa said Joho will not respond to Omar.
