So in case you hadn&rsquo;t noticed, today is April Fool&rsquo;s Day, the one day of the year where, traditionally, until noon, you should take everything you read, hear and see with an enormous pinch of salt and good humour.I couldn&rsquo;t honestly tell you the roots of this day, but from everything I have read about it in the past, it was most certainly one of those colonial imports like Valentine&rsquo;s Day that formerly colonised peoples hang onto, even as they struggle to decolonise themselves.A recent article in The Daily Telegraph says: &ldquo;April Fools' Day stems from the age when people used to hold spring festivals, marking the end of winter with 'mayhem and misrule', according to the Museum of Hoaxes.&rdquo;Whatever the day's origin, the media considers this the day when the people who publish what we now refer to as #FakeNews become quite irrelevant, as everybody gets in on the act.My first contribution to the #FakeNews industry encouraged by April 1 traditions came during a time of enormous political change in Kenya between 1989 to 1993, when the country's US ambassador was Smith Hempstone.This man had terrorised the government of the day and was the darling of the nascent opposition to President Daniel Moi and Kanu by threatening to assist in an overthrow of the old order.He became such a folk hero that the US embassy, which in those days was at the railway station end of Moi Avenue next to the Cooperative Bank building, became known in matatu language as Kwa Hempstone. If you wanted to get off there, you told the sliding door operator (conductor) of the Nissan matatu that you wanted to alight (only Kenyans alight - everyone else just gets off) at Kwa Hempstone.Anyway, the Kanu government&rsquo;s happiest moment of those years was when in 1992, the US voters effected regime change in the White House, throwing out Bush I and replacing him with Bill Clinton. By January 1993 when the new guy took office, it was supposed that he had his own people to appoint to the various ambassadorships and that the nyama choma-loving Hempstone would be packing his bags.However, by the end of March, no announcement had been made about Hempstone&rsquo;s replacement, and so I came up with the April 1 news story joke, to the effect that Clinton thought Hempstone had been such a raging success in Kenya, he was re-appointing him. The story ran on Page 1 and from the minute it appeared, the phones to the Times were ringing non-stop, with senior members of Kanu and the government losing their minds over this injustice by the incoming US president.The relief in their voices over the phone when told it was a joke was so intense you could almost touch it.I don&rsquo;t think I ever enjoyed #FakeNews as much as I did on that occasion, but then again, it was just harmless fun, unlike today, when alternative facts have become the scary new reality.
