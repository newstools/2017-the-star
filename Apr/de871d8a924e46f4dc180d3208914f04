Wiper leader and NASA co-principal Kalonzo Musyoka heads to Lamu on Saturday on a charm offensive. This is Kalonzo’s first visit to Lamu. The visit is expected to have a pacifying effect on Lamu, where the opposition enjoys considerable support. Deputy party leader Shakilla Abdalla said in the morning Kalonzo will tour Kizingitini village, Lamu East, after which he will address a public rally. In the afternoon he will hold another rally in Mkunguni Square, Lamu town. Abdalla, who is the county’s woman representative, was speaking in Lamu on Friday. Kalonzo will meet and welcome new entrants. He is expected to sell the Wiper and NASA manifestos. Kalonzo will introduce aspirants and issue nomination certificates. The visit comes a week after the last minute cancellation of ODM leader Raila Odinga’s visit.
