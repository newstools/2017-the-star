Lamu now has a new county headquarter following completion of the premises at Mokowe town, which has been under construction for two years.The new headquarters were built at a cost of Sh220 million and has offices of the governor and his seven county executives.Governor Issa Timamy and other staff are expected to move into the fully furnished new offices on May 2.On Tuesday, he said there are plans to expand the offices in future so that all relevant offices are under one roof.People with disability can easily access the offices, Timamy said.He said the objective was to have all services at a central station where they can be easily accessed by all as opposed to the previous situation where county offices were scattered in various buildings in Lamu town.&ldquo;We plan to move into the new offices on May 2. Our sole intention is to bring services closer to the people,&rdquo; Timamy said.Since 2013 the county government has had to rent offices in Lamu town to house the executives.Timamy said the completion of the headquarters will help cut costs and save the rent money for development.
