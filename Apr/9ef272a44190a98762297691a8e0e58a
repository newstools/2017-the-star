Armed Pokot bandits yesterday raided Kagir in Baringo North subcounty and drove away 300 goats towards Tiaty Sub-county.The 40-strong gang opened fire at 9am, leading to a fierce gun battle with Kenya Police Reservists.Witness Richard Chepchomei said the thugs overpowered the reservists, rounded up the goats and disappeared towards Seretion and Kashokon villages in the bordering East Pokot."People dispersed upon hearing the gunshots and the bandits had ample time to take away the goats,&rdquo; he said.Chepchomei said the goats belong to three people &mdash; Thomas Kibet, Samuel Chepkangor and Reuben Lokurein.They are among the few residents who returned home after the government assured more than 30,000 displaced families of security. They were displaced last month by armed pokot bandits in Baringo North and South subcounties.&ldquo;They honoured the government's call to go back ... they have now lost all their animals,&rdquo; Chepchomei said.He also pointed that the attacks happened only some three kilometres from Kagir police post and the officers did not shoot at the attackers, "meaning they might also come back to kill us again in their watch".On February 20, a breast feeding mother and her three-day-old baby from the village were killed by Pokot bandits as they fled violence. There have several attacks in the county.On March 17, President Uhuru Kenyatta deployed the Kenya Defence Forces to assist the police officers and KPRs to flush out the bandits from the volatile areas bordering Baringo, Laikipia and Elgeyo Marakwet counties.&ldquo;We are certain that there is no security operation going on since then. The KDF are just camped at Loruk trading centre as they silently watch the residents being attacked,&rdquo; Chepchomei said.He said there have ben five unreported attempted raids since last week.&ldquo;We want the government to come clear as to why there are no serious patrols or operations going on since President Uhuru declared these areas disturbed,&rdquo; Chepchomei said.He said about 10,000 people are still staying in camps, refusing to go back home for fear of attacks.Baringo county commander Peter Ndung'u declined to talk to journalists, saying he was busy and he would get back to the reporters later.Baringo North OCPD Ndiema Chemongis and county AP boss Robinson Ndiwa referred the Star's calls to the county commander, saying Ndung'u is in a better position to comment.
