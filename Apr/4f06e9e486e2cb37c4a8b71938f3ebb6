Police fired in the air several times yesterday to disperse two groups of youth stoning each other in Migori town, following a stand-off over planned ODM functions.One group is allied to Migori Governor Okoth Obado (pictured) and the other supports Suna East MP Junet Mohamed and governor aspirant Ochillo Ayacko (former Rongo MP).The area around Migori County Stadium, the earlier planned venue of the function, was a no-go zone as youths pelted each other with stones and police were overwhelmed and took the back seat.In the morning, youths demonstrated against Obado after ODM organisers were locked out of the stadium by the county government, before moving to Posta Grounds 200m away.Tension boiled over from Sunday night, when an arsonist threw a petrol bomb at the new Migori office that was due to be opened yesterday, partly burning a wall.When Obado tried to access Posta Grounds at 1pm, youths denied him entry forcing him and his supporters to move back to his office next to the stadium and occupy the new office.&ldquo;Let them know I won&rsquo;t tolerate this level of provocation and incitement. We will sit here [in the new office] and prevent it from opening. If they move to a new venue others will follow them,&rdquo; Obado told his supporters.&ldquo;As we stand here, this office is not going to be opened. We don&rsquo;t want violence brewed outside Migori here.&rdquo;Last year, the party branch officials rejected an office donated by Obado and acquired a new one next to the stadium.An angry Obado said that Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho and his entourage, which included senators Anyang&rsquo; Nyong&rsquo;o (Kisumu) and James Orengo (Siaya) did not inform him of the function.He accused the team of coming to Migori to endorse Junet and Ayacko ahead of the April 19 ODM primaries.&ldquo;Joho is deputy party leader. He should be highly neutral. The problem is that my colleague is coming into my territory and I have been kept out of the programme,&rdquo; Obado said.Youths allied to the governor prevented the office from being opened, forcing Junet and other leaders to have a meeting in Posta Grounds.In the morning, county party officials led by secretary Joseph Olala and youth leader Eric Opany said they woke up to find the office wall was destroyed using a petrol bomb.
