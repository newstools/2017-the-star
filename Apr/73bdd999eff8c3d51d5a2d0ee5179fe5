Lamu assembly speaker Mohamed Hashim, who is eyeing the Senate seat, has defected from Jubilee to ANC. The defection of Hashim, a former point man of Governor Issa Timamy’s main rival Fahim Twaha, is a huge boost to Timamy’s reelection. Last month, Hashim announced publicly he would seek the JP ticket. But speaking in Lamu on Friday, the former Lamu East MP said he no longer felt confident in Jubilee . “I am tired of the senator oppressing me and making it clear that I stood no chance in the party. I want to be in a party that takes care of the interests of all its members equally and that’s ANC,” Hashim said. “My gut feeling tells me fairness will not prevail during JP primaries. Thank God I won’t be there when it happens.”
