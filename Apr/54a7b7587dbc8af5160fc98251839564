With some teams having played eight matches, Wazito FC sit top of the table with 16 points from eight matches with GFE 105 second place two points adrift but with a game in hand.Palos, who were not in action over the Easter weekend, are fourth with 13 points with Nairobi City Stars completing the top five sides after playing out an entertaining 2-2 draw against KCB.Another loss left MOSCA bottom of the standings with only one point after a winless start to the start. The Ministry of Sports side were beaten by promoted side Kibera All stars who have started to find their feet in the second division and are now fourth from bottom with four points after notching their first win.St. Jospeh are second from bottom after losing 1-0 to Nairobi Stima who climbed up to eight just four points off top spot. Experienced second division campaigners Bidco are in danger of losing that status after a home loss to former Premier League side Agro Chemicals left them third from bottom with five points. League action resume tomorrow with Wazito likely to pick three more points against new boys Isibania while GFE will too look to get back to wining ways.Kibera will be out in search of a second successive win against high flying Vihiga.
