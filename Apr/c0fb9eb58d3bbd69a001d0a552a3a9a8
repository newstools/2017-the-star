Doctors from six counties in the South Rift region have threatened to boycott work to demand payment of their salaries withheld during the period they were on strike.The counties are Nakuru, Bomet, Kajiado, Laikipia, Narok and Kericho.The withheld salaries are for December through to March. KMPDU regional secretary general Dr Davji Atellah yesterday said doctors will be asked to boycott work if the counties do not convene a meeting by Thursday.In letters to the six counties on Monday, the union demanded county secretaries convene a meeting to discuss outstanding issues. The issues include payment of salaries and allowances in arrears in line with the return-to-work formula, promotions and welfare.&ldquo;It is impractical to expect doctors to work when they can&rsquo;t meet their basic needs,&rdquo; Atellah said. He added, &ldquo;Some doctors have been forced to trek to work while others have been given eviction notices for not paying rent. This is totally unacceptable. No reasons have been given for nonpayment of salaries dating back to December.&rdquo;Atellah said doctors will troop to governors&rsquo; offices to seek audience if they do not communicate. &ldquo;There is a salary crisis. We have not been paid since December. Some with payslips indicate salaries for between five to 10 days have been paid. Others have negative payslips. Doctors are willing to work but it&rsquo;s not possible,&rdquo; he said.Atellah said doctors in Nakuru and Bomet counties have been victimised &ldquo;Some were transferred from Nakuru to Naivasha without reimbursement of transfer allowance,&rdquo; Atellah said. Nakuru Health CS Mungai Kabii and chief officer Dr Samuel Mwaura were unavailable for comment.
