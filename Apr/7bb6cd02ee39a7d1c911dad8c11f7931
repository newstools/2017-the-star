The ODM National Election Board has been urged to learn from the mistakes of nominations in other counties and conduct a credible exercise in Kisumu. The Kisumu nominations will be on Monday. Nominations in parts of Nyanza and Western have been marred by confusion, delays, missing names – of aspirants and party members – and claims of rigging. “We have seen what has happened in Nyamira and Busia but hope that with each nomination day the party continues to learn something new,” governor aspirant Hezron Mc’Obewa said. “Kisumu is hotly contested and it is ODM’s headquarters in Western Kenya [so] we hope to have a credible nomination.” He spoke on the campaign trail in Kisumu on Wednesday.
