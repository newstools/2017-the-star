Tana River Governor Hussein Dado&rsquo;s reelection bid has received a major boost after two MPs who have been fierce critics of his administration joined his camp.Bura MP Ali Wario and his Galole counterpart Hassan Dukicha said they will campaign for Dado and Jubilee aspirants to ensure they win in the August 8 polls.They were speaking during a Jubilee Party rally in Bura yesterday.The two, like Dado, belong to the Orma community. They had accused the governor of not consulting residents in running county affairs, and presiding over corruption.Wario said they have held several meetings to iron out sticky issues, and agreed to work together for the sake of unity and prosperity of the county.&ldquo;I might have in the past opposed him, and I had reasons for doing that. But now we have resolved the underlying issues and we are in one party seeking to deliver,&rdquo; he said. Dukicha welcomed the renewed unity, saying it will lead to victory.Dado was elected on the Wiper ticket, but ditched the party last month for Jubilee. He was officially received by President Uhuru Kenyatta at State House, Mombasa.&ldquo;In my four years in the opposition, I have learnt that it can be an exercise in futility if one does not work closely with the government of the day,&rdquo; Dado said. Others in the governor race include ODM&rsquo;s Dhado Godana, Danson Mungatana (PDR), Nur Nassir (Wiper) and Adam Barisa of ODM.
