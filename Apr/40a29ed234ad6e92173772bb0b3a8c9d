A fierce political battle is envisioned between Governor Cyprian Awiti and his key opponents in the Homa Bay governor race.Awiti is facing off Kasipul MP Oyugi Magwanga and businessman Sammy Wakiaga - all Raila Odinga allies - for the ODM ticket.Cosmas Kanyadudi and businessman Enosh Bolo also want the ODM ticket to unseat Awiti.The party will hold primaries in the county on Monday, same day as those of Migori and Siaya.Read: ODM postpones Homa Bay, Migori primaries after hitchesBut political observers say they are yet to see strategies the contestants will use to beat the incumbent's perceived popularity.Out of the county's eight constituencies, the governor has three vote-rich constituencies solidly behind him.These are Karachuonyo, Kasipul and Kabondo sub-counties where locals have vowed to safeguard the seat.Karachuonyo votes are crucial for Awiti's second term bid. He has also backing from professionals across the county.Political analyst Jared Okello said Awiti is likely to be backed for the projects he has initiated."He has things he can point at for the county residents to reelect him for the second term, unlike his opponents.""Considering the well-structured campaign strategy he has put in place as an incumbent, Awiti is likely to win the ODM ticket," he said.The governor is also likely to reap from the votes of deputy governor Hamilton Orata's home turf in Ndhiwa.Orata is most likely to bring with a pool of votes that might propel them to clinch the ticket ahead of August 8.Some aspirants have already expressed fears the primaries will be shambolic especially at stronghold constituencies.Apart from Karachuonyo, the winning combination will rely on votes from Ndhiwa, Suba, and Rangwe to tilt the outcome."Awiti has worked extra hard to place himself above his opponents," Okelo said on Saturday in an interview with the Star.He sailed to the governorship following pre-2013 election agreements where the seats were spread across the county."The incumbent can still ride on the agreements to convince voters through an elaborate campaign," the analysts said.In the 2013 polls, Karachuonyo was given governor slot with Ndhiwa fronting the deputy governor.Rangwe and Mbita were handed the woman representative and Senate slots respectively.Okelo said these pacts, which still stand, are likely to disadvantage the candidature of Wakiaga, Magwanga, and Bolo.It is argued that based on the pacts, Suba cannot have governor and senate slots.The incumbent and Bolo both hail from Karachuonyo while Magwanga and Wakiaga are from Kasipul and Suba respectively.Also read: Use negotiations in Migori nominations to avert chaos, MP Anyanga tells ODMAwiti has also received the backing from Suba MP John Mbadi and other local leaders.Speaking to the Star, the governor said the rising political temperatures do not worry him."I am confident I will retain the seat having worked so hard to change the lives of Homa Bay residents."Leaders from Karachuonyo, which has the most voters, have been urging the electorate to protect the position."We have made a decision to support Awiti because we are impressed with his leadership style of inclusion," Okuta Ogot, a former councillor, said."He has created an enabling environment for investors," another voter told the Star on Saturday.Okello further noted that the success of ODM primaries in its strongholds will determine voter turnout during the general election.He said shambolic nominations have in the past led to voter apathy, which cost ODM critical seats.Okello said party leader Raila Odinga must not allow leaders to make the mistake of the 2013 polls.At that time, the party lost to rivals due to poor nominations.Raila earlier said the party has learned its lesson and no candidate will be imposed on the people.More on this: Police colluding with Jubilee to discredit ODM primaries, says Agnes ZaniBut Magwanga accused Awiti of failing to tackle corruption and poor development.He said the county lags behind despite funds being channeled from the Treasury for development.Wakiaga and Enosh Bolo also accused Awiti of poor performance.However, Awiti defended his administration against the allegations saying he has initiated projects in health, roads, water and agriculture sectors.Though, he has a tough task in convincing residents on the progress of mega projects that are yet to take off since they were birthed."Devolution is a new concept and I spent the last three years to put structures in place," he said, urging voters to consider the progress made.The governor challenged Magwanga to provide evidence of corruption allegations to relevant authority of investigations.
