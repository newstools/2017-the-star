Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero has exuded confidence that he will floor Jubilee candidate Mike Sonko in the August 8 polls.Sonko beat his fierce rival Peter Kenneth in the Jubilee primaries on Thursday and will now face Kidero in the general elections.Sonko garnered 138,185 votes against Kenneth&rsquo;s 62,504. Former Starehe MP Margaret Wanjiru, who was also in the race for the Jubilee ticket, got 7,654 votes.&ldquo;I am not surprised. All along we knew Sonko was going to be our competitor. So we are not worried and Nairobians will prove that in August,&rdquo; he said on phone on Friday.Kidero claimed that going by the just concluded JP nominations, the party enjoys the support of only about 300,000 out of the over two million registered voters, which cannot guarantee them victory in August. &ldquo;Sonko and Jubilee are not popular in Nairobi. If you look at their primaries for instance, only about 300,000 people participated and in 2013, over 500,000 people participated in ODM primaries. That shows you which party is stronger,&rdquo; he said.In 2013 elections, Sonko won the Senate seat by over 814,184 votes. Kidero on the other hand won the governor seat by 692, 483 votes against his closest challenger Ferdinand Waititu&rsquo;s 617, 839.The governor said that the city residents will be re-elect him because of his development record.&ldquo;Our level of preparedness is determined by who our competitor is. It is determined by the urban integrated development plan that we have developed,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;It is based on Human Resource management plans that we have put in place and Solid waste management plan that we have developed with JICA,&rdquo; said the city boss.
