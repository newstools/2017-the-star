National Assembly minority leader Francis Nyenze&rsquo;s outburst over the Raila-Kalonzo NASA ticket shows the alliance is democratic, Wiper secretary general Hassan Omar said yesterday.He said the perception that Wiper will bolt out of NASA was created by the media.Omar said it is that aspect that is used to judge every dissenting voice in NASA.&ldquo;One or two divergent opinions that are not satisfied with a decision is not evidence of cracks. It is often evidence of democracy," Omar said.&ldquo;Divergence is not division. Divergence is actually a healthy evidence of democracy.&rdquo;He spoke to the press from the Renaissance Centre in Mombasa on Sunday.Nyenze on Friday said the NASA lineup putting ODM leader Raila Odinga as the flagbearer and Wiper's Kalonzo Musyoka as his running mate was a raw deal for the Kamba community.He said the alliance should have respected the MoU signed between Raila and Kalonzo in 2013, before naming the ODM leader the flagbearer."In my own opinion, the Kamba nation got a raw deal and we do not want anybody to take Kamba's for a ride," Nyenze said.He said, "new people" were brought into the coalition to circumvent the whole process.But Omar said there is no democracy in the world, where there is absolute unity.&ldquo;Show me absolute unity and I will show you an absolute dictator. Where there is absolute, you realise that there is an absolute dictator,&rdquo; he said.Omar cited the Nyayo era, where dissenting voices were suppressed with violence, saying that is what the NASA brigade has been fighting all along.&ldquo;We want our members to debate every issue fundamental to the alliance, but not lose sight of the bigger picture,&rdquo; he said.Wiper will ascribe itself to any consensus.&ldquo;The problem is that you ran a narrative that Wiper will bolt out....When the devil was shamed, some of you continued to run the narrative that there is disharmony,&rdquo; he said.The NASA deal was not the most perfect, but the most ideal in the prevailing circumstance, Omar said.&ldquo;Wiper is committed to the presidency of NASA,&rdquo; he said.He asked Nyenze and other dissenting voices to be part of the NASA vehicle, despite the legitimate concerns they raise.&ldquo;We are part of that arrangement. We appreciate the concerns by some of our members, but we are asking them to be party to this great narrative,&rdquo; Omar said.
