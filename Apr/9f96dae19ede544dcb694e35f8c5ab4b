Disgruntled Wiper aspirants have alleged a plot by Senator Hassan Omar to rig in favourites in Tuesday&rsquo;s primaries.Omar is the party&rsquo;s secretary general and has a big say in the party affairs.But Omar fired back yesterday and said he will only support those who have been campaigning for him.The aspirants are saying Tuesday&rsquo;s primary in Mombasa is being designed to fail to aid handpicking. Similar trick cost ODM badly in 2013. ODM&rsquo;s favorites, apparently &ldquo;handpicked&rdquo;, witnessed an embarrassing defeat and the party&rsquo;s parliament control was greatly dented as a result.Party primaries in Kenya have often been a sham. The aspirants have raised fear Wiper is headed for big defeat, based on the level of interference and unpreparedness.Omar&rsquo;s office has been accused of having direct interest in the nominations exercise.&ldquo;I stick with the person who prefers me. It&rsquo;s logic. This is not rocket science,&rdquo; Omar said in a press conference in Mombasa.&ldquo;Someone else has been campaigning for an outsider and you expect me not to have sympathy for the one who has been campaigning for me? This person has campaigned for me amongst the aspirants and members."Wiper Mombasa Coordinator Affia Rahma is leading the protest. She will face off with Zamzam Mohamed for women representative ticket. Zamzam is always accompanying Omar and has had the privilege to be recognized by Omar when he addresses press.
