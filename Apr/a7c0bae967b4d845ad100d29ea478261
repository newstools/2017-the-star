More than 10 Jubilee aspirants in Mombasa have demanded repeat primaries in the county, threatening to ditch the party and campaign for NASA. This is a headache for the party that is preparing for a battle with NASA in the county. Jubilee governor aspirant Suleiman Shahbal chaired a meeting to prevent a fallout after the Wednesday primaries. Top among the complaining aspirants is Mombasa Deputy Governor Hazel Katana, who was edged out of the Senate seat race by Abdulsalaam Kassim, and Hussein Kabilia, whose name was missing from ballot papers despite paying Sh220,000 in nomination fees for the ticket to vie for the Mvita MP seat.He has contacted his lawyers to seek legal redress. Board chairman Sureya Hersi said all who feel aggrieved have to file their complaints with the party&rsquo;s appeals tribunal, who will make the final decision.
