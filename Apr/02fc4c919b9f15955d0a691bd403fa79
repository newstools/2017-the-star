The Council of Legal Education has asked the DPP to take legal action against Moi University for misleading the public on its capacity to offer law degrees.CLE chief executive professor Kulunde Bitonye said the university does not meet quality standards to offer the Bachelor of Law (LL.B) degree.Bitonye dismissed a press statement in which the institution assured the public that its offers were legal. He said the school did not meet the requirements of the Legal Education Act."Press statements issued on March 22, 23 and 28 contravene Section 43 of the Act which criminalises false statements from legal education providers.""In accordance with the Legal Education Act, current regulations and determination by the council, Moi University is not a legal education provider," he said.The council boss said the Moi University council and Vice Chancellor Laban Ayiro should be held to account over the matter.There has been a push and pull between the CLE and the college since 2009 over the law school's credibility.CLE is mandated by law to regulate, license and supervise legal providers in Kenya.It also approves qualifications obtained outside Kenya, administers professional examinations and advises the government on matters relating to legal education training.The council withdrew Moi University&rsquo;s license to offer LL.B degrees in September 2015 after a series of audits and inspections.A decision in March 2015 also barred the institution from offering Masters of Law (LL.M) programme.The council&rsquo;s report, dated September 23, 2015, noted that the university was &ldquo;severely incapacitated&rdquo; and could not deliver the LL.B programme as originally anticipated."The institution lacks the wherewithal to provide quality legal education in consonance with the law, regulations and inspection guidelines set by the council," part of the report reads.The university scored 36 per cent, way below the minimum threshold of at least 67 per cent required of legal education providers.Among issues raised in the audit were planning and governance, admission requirements, class size and enrollment data, curricula and modes of delivery, examinations administration and academic staff qualifications.Moi University successfully challenged the decision by the CLE that stopped the institution from offering the LL.B degree at the High court.Justice George Odunga at that time said the council has no jurisdiction, on its own motion, to accredit or withdraw accreditation of universities in Kenya.This was quashed at the appellate court following an application by the council of legal education.Read: Court allows Moi, MKU to offer law courses According to Bitonye, Moi University ignored an advisory requiring it to get a licence under the Legal Education Act upon the expiry of its provisional licence on September 30, 2015."Where has the Council and Management of Moi University been since April 7, 2016, when the council notified it of non-compliance?" he asked
