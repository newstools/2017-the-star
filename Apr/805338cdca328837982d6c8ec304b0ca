A 13-year-old girl from Kajiado county is fighting for her life after developing birth complications at Kajiado District Hospital.Comatose Naimayo Leiyo is admitted in the intensive care unit at the Kenyatta National Hospital with pre-eclampsia.It is a condition in pregnancy characterised by high blood pressure and often a significant amount of protein in the urine.&ldquo;It is often followed by coma,&rdquo; Doctor Ifrah Hersi told the Star yesterday. &ldquo;Anyone can develop this condition. It is not age limiting.&rdquo;It can be controlled by taking anti hypertensive medication which helps expectant mothers avoid birth complications.Leiyo was taken to theatre on April 16 after part of her brain started bleeding. &ldquo;It is actually a watch-and-wait situation,&rdquo; Hersi said. &ldquo;If a patient is stable she will wake up from her coma after three or four days. If she is not stable we cannot give a timeline.&rdquo; This is the second patient being treated in KNH from Kajiado in one month. Another teenage girl, same age as Leiyo, was admitted with the same condition.Nursing officer in-charge of ICU ward Anne Ngesa, however, said her condition was worse because she developed kidney failure and died on April 6.
