Tottenham kept the pressure up on Chelsea in the title race, but Mauricio Pochettino&rsquo;s side can count themselves a little lucky that they had all 11 men on the field for the second half of their 1-0 win over Crystal Palace.Victor Wanyama, booked in the 26th minute for a poor tackle on Luka Milivojevic, could easily have been sent off for another offence just eight minutes later on Andros Townsend.But referee Jon Moss opted only for a stern word with the midfielder, before Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino withdrew him at half time. And Jamie Redknapp, speaking as a pundit on Sky Sports, was unable to believe the Tottenham man was not sent off.&ldquo;They are certainly lucky to have 11 men on the pitch because Wanyama is certainly of two yellow card tackles,&rdquo; said Redknapp.&ldquo;The first one was certainly a yellow card. Then, when you&rsquo;ve been booked, it&rsquo;s irresponsible to go to ground. &ldquo;You just have to stay on your feet. As difficult as it is, as much as believe you&rsquo;re going to win the ball. &ldquo;Townsend goes over easily, but you cannot do that. You are already on tenterhooks, you have to understand your responsibility as a midfield player, stay on your feet and show him into areas.&rdquo; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s very lucky. I cannot believe that after booking him for the first one he doesn&rsquo;t do it for the second one.&rdquo;&ldquo;I remember in his Southampton days, in his Celtic days. He can be reckless, he goes to ground too easily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a big fan of him as a player, but he has to eradicate those moments. Palace boss Sam Allardyce took a similar view, claiming that Moss had &lsquo;not been brave enough&rsquo; to send Wanyama off. &ldquo;The second one was worse than the first,&rsquo; said Allardyce after seeing his team lose by a single goal.&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Jon Moss being kind to Wanyama. Mauricio was very clever substituting him at half time. &ldquo;Referees see it as they see it. I think he made the wrong decision. It&rsquo;s a big game on the telly, I don&rsquo;t think he was brave enough.&ldquo;But there you go, we have to live with that.&rdquo;
