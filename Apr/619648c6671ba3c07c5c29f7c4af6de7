The Teso South Council of Elders has rejected ODM National Election Board&rsquo;s order for a repeat of the primaries for the Busia governor&rsquo;s seat.Addressing the press in Busia town on Tuesday, council secretary John Ikokonyi said the exercise was conducted and the winner declared as Sospeter Ojaamong.&ldquo;We were shocked to hear media reports to the effect nominations were rigged in favour of the incumbent. The propaganda and malicious information can unfortunately cause violence and create a rift between the Iteso and Luhya communities, which have lived together peacefully for a long time,&rdquo; he said.The party was within its mandate to give a provisional certificate to the winner, Ikokonyi said.&ldquo;As elders, we humbly respect and honour the outcome. The cancellation of the nomination results by board chairperson Judith Pareno was done hurriedly and in bad faith,&rdquo; he said.The elders said they respect the opinions of other leaders, but will not entertain &ldquo;external political interference in the internal affairs of Busia county, such as the statement attributed to Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo&rdquo;.&ldquo;Whether we are herders or the minority, we are Kenyans by right and more so the residents and founders of Busia county. As elders we do not condone arrogance, intimidation, abusive language or any form of oppression from our neighbours,&rdquo; Ikokonyi said.&ldquo;We uphold the peaceful co-existence of the Iteso, Luhya and other communities residing in our beautiful county.&rdquo;Funyula MP Paul Otuoma had said he will not take part in a repeat of the primaries, but insisted he will be on the ballot. He said he won the initial primaries. Otuoma said ODM should respect the voice and will of the people of Busia.
