World&rsquo;s leading banks, think-tanks and consultancies have joined the queue in downgrading the country&rsquo;s growth outlook for 2017, citing slowdown in private sector credit and dampening business sentiment ahead of August polls.A consensus growth projection from 12 global institutions shows the country&rsquo;s economy is likely to expand by 5.4 per cent, a slower growth than 5.8 per cent last year.The firms are JPMorgan of the US ( 4.9 per cent), HSBC of UK ( 5.0 per cent), Standard Chartered Bank ( 4.5 per cent), Barclays Capital ( 5.7 per cent) and New York-based brokerage firm Citigroup Global Markets ( 5.2 per cent).Others are Fitch Ratings-owned BMI Research ( 5.6 per cent), consultancy firm Capital Economics of UK ( 5.5 per cent), Washington-headquartered Frontier Strategy ( 4.6 per cent), Economist Intelligence Unit ( 5.5 per cent) and credit insurance firm Euler Hermes of France ( 6.5 per cent).Oxford Economics, the Oxford University&rsquo;s economic forecasting arm, sees Kenya growing by 6.4 per cent while Euromonitor International, a London-headquartered research firm, projects a 5.6 per cent growth.&ldquo;GDP growth is expected to slow this year, as the interest rate cap continues to choke business investment,&rdquo; economists at FocusEconomics, the Barcelona-based macroeconomic analysis firm, said in a consensus report. &ldquo;In addition, political uncertainty around the August presidential election could dampen business sentiment.&rdquo;The analysts said last year&rsquo;s growth of 5.8 per cent was largely supported by external sector. Import bill reduced due to low crude oil prices while exports continued to grow, though at a slower pace, denoting demand in foreign markets, they said.&ldquo;This offset weaker domestic demand, as both private and government consumption slowed and fixed investment swung to contraction, with the latter trend aggravated by the government&rsquo;s decision to cap interest rates in September,&rdquo; FocusEconomics said.The powerful Bretton Woods institutions &ndash;the World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund &ndash; have piled pressure on the government to scrap rate cap to spur domestic demand, which has traditionally supported growth.&ldquo;Although the adverse effects of the controls are manageable in the near term, if maintained, they could potentially pose a risk to financial stability,&rdquo; IMF deputy managing director and acting chair Tao Zhang said in a statement on January 26.
