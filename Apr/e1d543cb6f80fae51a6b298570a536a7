Kenya Secondary Schools Sports Association (KSSSA) chairman Kimutai Ng&rsquo;etich has warned head teachers and games masters against any form of cheating as the Brookside Term One games get underway today in Nairobi.Previously, punishment was directed to the players and teams but with the amended KSSSA constitution, head teachers and games masters will be the biggest casualties.Ng&rsquo;etich said cheating can never take place in a team without either the head teacher or games master&rsquo;s knowledge. If anything, they are the ones who are behind these ill doings.&ldquo;There is no one who can get into a school without the knowledge of the head teacher. So when a team field ineligible player, it is done with the full consent of the principal hence he or she must be held liable,&rdquo; Ng&rsquo;etich notified teachers, indicating that the KSSSA showpiece is designed for students of ages 19 and below.He noted that there must be some consistency in the team lists from the sub-county level to the national championships. The constitution amendments require that the teams be vetted by games coordinators and county/regional educational officers in the presence of Teachers Service Commission representatives. &ldquo;In case of any irregularities, we will hand over the head teacher and games master of that particular team to TSC&rsquo;s point man for the games who will immediately initiate the process of retribution,&rdquo;&ldquo;These Games are reserved for a specific and an already defined group. We should allow them to benefit from it,&rdquo; added Ng&rsquo;etich.
