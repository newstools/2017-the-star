PNU is dead, buried and will not get support in Meru and across the country, Senator Kiraitu Murungi has said.He said the party has no agenda for Meru and urged party leader and Governor Peter Munya to drop his bid for President in 2022 because &ldquo;he will go nowhere.&rdquo; Kiraitu spoke on Monday at his home in Nkubu after meeting youths from all nine constituencies in Meru who converged to support his bid to unseat Munya.&ldquo;We have seen many people going for that seat, but they have backed down. The likes of Martha Karua, Peter Kenneth, Koigi Wamwere and Paul Muite were all gunning for the presidency, but did they win? They have now opted for the governor seat and others have bowed out of politics so there is nothing new about Munya&rsquo;s bid. He will be humiliated,&rdquo; he said.Kiraitu said if Munya does not support Deputy President William Ruto&rsquo;s 2022 presidential bid, &ldquo;he is definitely not for President Uhuru Kenyatta in 2017.&rdquo;&ldquo;Without Ruto, Uhuru would not have clinched the seat so that is why we want to support Ruto for 2022 as we know nobody from Mt Kenya will stand a better chance. Munya is no better than Peter Kenneth or Martha Karua, so does he think he is special?&rdquo; he said. Kiraitu said when campaigning for Munya in 2013, he told him to prioritise water if elected governor, but after Munya clinched the seat, he became &ldquo;big headed&rdquo;.He said Munya does not take advice from anyone regarding how to run the county.&ldquo;The kind of leadership Munya exercises has been overtaken by time. He is like Kamuzu Banda and Mobutu Sese Seko. If he dreams something it will be implemented without subjects questioning. That&rsquo;s why he must go. If elected, I will consult unlike arrogant Munya,&rdquo; Kiraitu said.
