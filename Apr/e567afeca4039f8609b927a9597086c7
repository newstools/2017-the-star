ODM leader Raila Odinga has defied IEBC's directive that nominations commence on April 12.He told journalists in Bondo that the party will hold its primaries on April 7 as earlier planned.The electoral commission on Wednesday said nominations can only commence 12 days after aspirants' names are gazetted.Chairman Wafula Chebukati said the commission gazetted names presented by 57 political parties on April 1."So far, only 57 out of 67 registered political parties have submitted their membership lists."But Raila said parties are independent and as such cannot take orders from the commission on when to conduct the mini-polls.ODM has planned to kick off the primaries at Bungoma, Busia, and Machakos on the first day of the exercise.Kisii, Nyamira, Samburu and Trans Nzoia will follow on April 9 in the nominations that will end on April 23."IEBC should not try to micromanage parties but to allow them to run their own programs of nominations," Raila said.The Opposition chief said all parties have constitutions and rules which cannot be breached by the electoral agency."Dates and manner of conducting party nominations are not IEBC's business. These lie squarely with party leaders and members," he said.Raila further said there was no reason for the IEBC to gazette the names of aspirants taking part in the primaries.He cited cases in the UK where the government does not regulate how the Labour or Conservative parties conduct their affairs."The same applies to the US. Political parties are free since membership is voluntary. We don&rsquo;t want to be micromanaged."He said they will observe the electoral timelines, address any rows from the process and ensure the same is free and fair.Read: 19.5 million voters listed in IEBC draft register, says ChebukatiAlso read: Gunshots disrupt ODM nominationsBungomaBusiaMachakosKisiiNyamiraSamburuTransnzoiaMombasaKilifiKwaleTana RiverSiayaKisumu
