Two Kajiado politicians on Tuesday evening called each other &ldquo;prostitute&rdquo; during an altercation in a city hotel. Governor aspirant Joseph Lenku and Kajiado East MP Peris Tobiko were with Kajiado West MP Moses Sakuda, Kajiado woman representative Mary Seneta, governor aspirant Tarayia ole Kores and Senator Peter Mositet.They had been summoned by Jubilee Party top officials for a meeting at Ole Sereni Hotel on Mombasa Road to &ldquo;iron out some pressing issues&rdquo; about tomorrow&rsquo;s nominations.An employee at the hotel said when Tobiko extended her hand to greet Lenku, the governor aspirant started calling her names. Witnesses said Tobiko hit back and called Lenku a &ldquo;prostitute&rdquo;. It is at this point an angry Lenku grabbed an empty glass and was about to throw it at Tobiko when Mositet stopped him. &ldquo;Lenku abused me by using unprintable vulgar language. The fellow is primitive, uncultured and delinquent. He is simply sick and not fit for any leadership position,&rdquo; said Tobiko in a text message. When contacted, Lenku confirmed to have had &ldquo;some friction&rdquo; with Tobiko.&ldquo;I had to hit back. It was payback time, it gave me an opportunity to reply to her abuses she has been directing at me in social media pages,&rdquo; Lenku said.
