ODM members in Malindi constituency will today choose who between incumbent MP Willy Mtengo and Kilifi Woman representative Aisha Jumwa will be the party candidate in the August 8 polls.The two erstwhile allies turned rivals do not see eye to eye, and have for months traded accusations and insults ahead of today's nominations.It will be a close battle to call as they have equally fought hard to secure the ticket. ODM is the popular party both in Malindi and Kilifi county. They held last minute rallies since Eater holidays began, to secure the constituents' support. Jumwa did not make good her earlier threat to ditch the party and instead, intensified her nomination campaigns at the grassroots, and maintained she was the people's choice. She insisted she would fight it out in ODM.Jumwa, a fierce ODM and party leader Raila Odinga supporter, announced her interest in the Malindi MP seat immediately after Mtengo was sworn in March last year. Mtengo and his team have held a series of meetings to showcase his development record in the past one year he has been in office.Mtengo said he had initiated three primary and three secondary schools, set up additional 49 classrooms in different lerning institutions across the constituency, and bought three school buses.The MP also said he has initiated reforms at the Malindi Subcounty Hospital to ensure locals get proper healthcare services.Jumwa in one of her rallies at Pishi Mwenga, Jilore ward, on Monday said she was the ODM brigadier in Malindi and residents have decided to choose her as the party candidate. She dismissed claims she had ditched ODM, saying it was mere propaganda by her rivals.&ldquo;I am the commander-in-chief of ODM in Malindi. I cannot step down in favour of anyone,&rsquo;&rsquo; she said.Jumwa urged the National Election Board to ensure the nominations for Malindi, Kilifi County and Coast region at large are free and fair.She said it was sad to see women being intimidated in the party like the case of Elizabeth Ongoro who was forced to ditch ODM for ANC due to frustrations.&ldquo;ODM women should not fear, they should be free and fight fearlessly,&rsquo;&rsquo; said the Women Rep.On the other Hand Mtengo in one of the rallies at Kwa Vumbi in Malindi town dismissed claims that Jumwa was the ODM brigadier in the constituency.The MP said the current Kilifi North MP Gideon Mung&rsquo;aro was first to be elected ODM legislator nine years ago in Malindi and told Jumwa not to brag as she just came to Malindi two years ago.Mtengo was accompanied by Magarini Parliamentary hopeful Michael Kingi, ODM Chief Campaigner Kilifi County Kingi Ngombo, Aspiring MCAS Ustadh Athman (Shella Ward) and David Kadenge of Malindi town ward.The Incumbent MP said Malindi was not ready to elect a woman who was always insulting people and discrediting men.&ldquo;I will not play politics of insults and shall win the nominations, Malindi people have so many problems that cannot be solved with insults,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said.The Malindi MP wondered why the same women rep said &lsquo;Mtengo tosha&rsquo; during the By election and had now turned against him in only one year.Both leaders prayed for peaceful nominations and asked youths to desist from violence and not accept to be used by politicians to cause chaos.Ends
