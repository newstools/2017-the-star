Transport on the Gilgil-Nyahururu road was halted for hours on Friday afternoon as residents of Loliondo, Karugutu and Mundi in Ol Kalou protested against the persistent water shortage.They shouted, blew whistles and chanted, &ldquo;We want water. We want water.&rdquo;They blocked the road near Simba Primary School, demanding Nyandarua Governor Daniel Waithaka meet them.They accused him of not caring about their problems.The dams in the area have dried up and the county government is said to have drilled a borehole, but residents say that is a lie.&ldquo;He is not a good governor because we are suffering for lack of water. The other day he said the people from Loliondo are fighting him politically, yet it is he who has failed to deliver,&rdquo; resident Wa Kinyanjui said.Residents said a week ago, the governor promised to send Water chief officer Martin Kamami to assess the problem, but he only visited when residents demonstrated.The governor, they said, asked them to appoint a five-member team to discuss their problem with his office to find a lasting solution. &ldquo;When we went to his office in Ol Kalou, we were told he was not in,&rdquo; resident Peter Mwaniki said.They also accused the Waithaka administration of embezzling money meant for water projects. &ldquo;We saw a pamphlet indicating a borehole has been drilled at Kagaa, which should serve us too. The governor should come and commission it if it actually exists,&rdquo; resident Njenga Thanatwa said.They said Karau MCA Kamau Ngotho told them that Sh3million has been allocated to rehabilitate Karugutu Dam, an allegation Kamami denied.Kamami had rushed to Loliondo to try to calm the situation and persuade residents to unblock the road.They defied him after he denied knowledge of the Sh3million said to have been allocated for the dam rehabilitation.&ldquo;Whoever told you Sh3 million has been allocated for Karugutu Dam should explain. I don&rsquo;t know about it,&rdquo; Kamami saidThe protesters said Waithaka should quit if he is unable to solve their problems.Nyandarua police boss Wilson Kosgei failed to persuade them to listen to Kamami.&ldquo;This government official has been sent here to seek a solution to your problem. Do not belittle him,&rdquo; he said Kamami left after residents refused to listen to him.
