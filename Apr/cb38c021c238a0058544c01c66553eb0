The Internally Displaced Persons Support Initiative has sued to stop disbursement of Sh6 billion meant for resettlement and compensation. They are demanding a list of the beneficiaries. The group said the government, through the Devolution and Interior ministries, may pay fake IDPs.They said a scam is likely, as the process is not open to members of the initiative and IDPs&rsquo; leaders. &ldquo;There is no information on who the beneficiaries are. Thus, the genuine IDPs will not benefit and thus their rights and fundamental freedoms are being violated,&rdquo; CEO Stephen Mbogwa said.The group filed its case at the High Court in Nakuru on Thursday. Under the government resettlement assistant programme, each IDP gets Sh10,000 start-up capital to rebuild burnt houses, Sh25,000 for basic reconstruction and two-and-a-quarter acres.order not grantedThrough lawyer Wilfred Konosi said there is no mechanism for genuine IDPs to check whether they will receive compensation.Justice Maureen Odero said the court cannot grant the orders until all parties involved have been served.The court will serve a notice for the mention date to the advocate. Those sued are the PSs in the ministries of Devolution and Interior, and the Attorney General.The IDPs said the process is discriminatory and selective and may cause suffering.
