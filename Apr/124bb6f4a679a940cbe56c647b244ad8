This is the week the party primaries begin preparatory to the August 8 general election. If a number of preparations for the primaries last week are anything to go by, then there is reason to be worried.Party primaries provide a good opportunity for Kenyans to begin to choose their leaders for the next five-year electoral cycle. These nominations must therefore be beyond reproach, as clean as a whistle and presage a similarly credible election.The political party leaders and national election boards must give everyone who wants to vie a chance and leave it up to the electorate to choose.They should allow the will of the people to prevail.The police have a key role to play in securing all poll stations and preventing any descent into violence and chaos.Aspirants should not be warmongers and those who lose need to be good losers who live to vie another day.Voters should not allow themselves to be used for any nefarious purposes.
