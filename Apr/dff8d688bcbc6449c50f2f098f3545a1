ODM's decision to issue direct tickets without subjecting aspirants to competitive nominations is evidence of how little it values democracy, President Uhuru Kenyatta has said.The President said Raila Odinga's party acted against the tenets of democracy which require that voters be given real choices.Uhuru further said the "dishing out of certificates over a cup of tea in a boardroom" was a regressive act that tarnished democracy.&ldquo;They are issuing nominations like sweets from the pocket; that is not what democracy is about,&rdquo; he said on Friday.He challenged the Opposition to hold nominations to prove to Kenyans that they can walk the talk.ODM gave direct nomination to 427 aspirants ranging from governors to MCAs. At least 16 governor aspirants were among them.Deputy President William Ruto criticised the Opposition for "putting their interests before those of Kenyans" by creating positions to accommodate all four principals in government. The others are Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper), Musalia Mudavadi (Amani) and Moses Wetang'ula (Ford Kenya).Ruto said the "selfish trait" has resulted in no development and unemployment for youths.The DP said Kenyans will make informed decisions based on what leaders are capable of delivering, not tribe or religion.&ldquo;The die is cast and the contest is declared. Kenyans are ready to choose," Ruto said, adding Jubilee leaders are development-oriented and that the Opposition's are not.He added that Kenyans need answers on what the money Jubilee has given for development is being used for.The two spoke after commissioning projects in Narok county. These included the Sh1.5 billion Narok Water Supply Project, the Sh750 million Narok Sewerage Project at a cost of Sh750 million and the augmentation of Suswa Water Supply at a cost of Sh70 million.Uhuru also launched the upgrading of Narok &ndash; Sekenani Gate Road to bitumen standards at a cost of Sh2.2 billion. The road is a vital link to the Maasai Mara National Reserve.The President also commissioned the construction of Ololunga Mukenyo-RWC road at a cost of Sh720 million and medical equipment worth Sh430 million at Narok County Referral Hospital.The equipment, supplied through the Managed Equipment Services (MES) project, included theatre equipment, sterilisation and surgical sets, digital imaging equipment and five dialysis machines.Equipment worth Sh380 million was also launched at Transmara County Hospital.Narok leaders who spoke at the event said the Opposition was spreading falsehoods about the government and how it relates with the people of the region.Governor Samuel Tunai said the Jubilee administration has appointed more Maasais than any other administration to senior positions.Tunai said the people of the region appreciate the upgrading of road networks; the government will spend about Sh12 billion on roads in Narok alone.Read: Jubilee has done a lot for Maasais, Uhuru tells Kajiado leaders at State HouseAlso read: We will support Jubilee in 2017, Maasai leaders tell Uhuru'Politics of decorum'The President urged politicians to embrace sobriety and conduct their campaigns peacefully, saying these are key to building a strong and stable nation.Uhuru warned against political squabbles and incitement, terming the vices &ldquo;misguided routes to leadership that, apart from planting the seed of hatred and enmity, do not serve the interests of the electorate&rdquo;.&ldquo;When leaders fight, citizens are the ones who lose. I therefore urge politicians to shun political bickering which creates an unfavourable environment for development,&rdquo; he said.He spoke after laying the foundation stone for Narok's Dikirr Level Hospital, which he said will also get specialised medical equipment through MES for the benefit of Emurua Dikirr residents.&ldquo;This hospital will cost over Sh200 million to become a level 4 facility. Once complete, we will install modern equipment including x-ray machines, theatre equipment, radiology, surgical and sterilisation kits and a modern laboratory,&rdquo; he said.The President urged members of the public to elect good leaders who will help his administration develop the country.&ldquo;We will not achieve our development agenda as a nation if we continue with divisive politics. That&rsquo;s why I keep insisting that leaders and Kenyans need to work as a team,&rdquo; he said.
