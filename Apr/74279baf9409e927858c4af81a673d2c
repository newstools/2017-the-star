The Naivasha subcounty security committee has outlawed night fishing &mdash; dusk to dawn &mdash; in Lake Naivasha after two fishermen drowned.That brings to six the number of fishermen who have died in one month while fishing at night. Eight have died this year.The committee said boat accidents, mainly at night, are on the rise.Subcounty commissioner Isaac Masinde said they are working with the Department of Fisheries in enforcing the directive. &ldquo;The accidents are occurring at night when the winds are strong and the tides are high and we have decided to ban night fishing,&rdquo; Masinde said.He warned that anyone caught violating the law will be arrested and charged.Masinde, the chairman of the subcounty security committee, said strong winds in the lakeside town have hurt fishing. &ldquo;Fishermen will be allowed in the lake between 6am and 6pm. We urged them to adhere to the directive or their licences will be cancelled,&rdquo; he said.Lake Naivasha Boat Owners Association chairman David Kilo said the ban is timely, because accidents are increasing.He said illegal fishing is being carried out in breeding grounds, which hurts fish production.&ldquo;I urge all the fishermen to wear life jackets when they venture into the lake as this could save their lives, once an accident occurs,&rdquo; he said.Kilo said the association will educate the fishermen on safety.The ban was announced after the search for the body of a fisherman who drowned last week was called off. This was due to thick water hyacinth weed around the scene of the accident. Those involved said the weed has hampered navigation, making it impossible to search for the missing body.Diver Simon Mureithi said they will have to wait for the body to float.
