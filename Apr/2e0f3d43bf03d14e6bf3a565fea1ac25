Narok Governor Samuel Tunai has denied claims he was involved in the aborted Jubilee Party nominations last Friday.He said nobody, including President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto, is to blame for the shortage of polling materials, which led to the cancellation of the primaries in 21 counties.Tunai spoke when he met Jubilee aspirants in Narok town on Saturday. He said Kenyans should direct their questions to the party National Elections Board. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m wondering why some leaders peddle lies that I had a hand in the nominations. I can&rsquo;t do that because I&rsquo;m an aspirant,&rdquo; Tunai said.He urged the opposition parties&rsquo; leaders to stop interfering with the Jubilee primaries. &ldquo;I want to thank all aspirants who worked tirelessly to ensure their supporters did not cause chaos after the primaries were cancelled,&rdquo; Tunai said.He warned aspirants inciting people to violence on account of tribe, clans or age, saying the party will not allow such behaviour. &ldquo;This is our party and people are free to elect the leaders they want. Those politicians threatening other people should face the full wrath of the law,&rdquo; Tunai said.
