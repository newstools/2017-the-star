Squabbles between two critical organs of the National Super Alliance scuttled the three-day opposition retreat putting plans of unveiling the coalition&rsquo;s flagbearer into jeopardy.The details emerged amid revelations that Ford Kenya has no candidate for the Bungoma senator position amid allegations that the seat could be Moses Wetangula&rsquo;s fallback plan.The Star has established that there is bad blood between a section of politicians in the NASA National Coordinating Committee and the technical wing.The disagreements are said to have slowed the progress of preparation of the final report that was to be presented to the NASA chiefs ahead of a make-or-break retreat.Mistrust and backstabbingSources familiar with the behind-the-scene intrigues also said there is mistrust and backstabbing between the five-member technical committee themselves.The technical team consists of East African Legislative Assembly member Abubakar Zein, ex-Mumias Sugar chairman Dan Ameyo and Koitamet ole Kina, a public policy expert and former consultant in former Prime Minister Raila Odinga&rsquo;s office.Others are economist David Ndii and unidentified woman from Northeastern representing Ford Kenya.Some leaders reportedly opposed to a Raila presidential candidature are said to have singled out Ndii for condemnation, accusing him of preparing biased and partisan reports.&ldquo;NCC has complained that Ndii is the one dragging his feet, he is the one dragging the work of the technical team for whatever reason,&rdquo; a source told the Star yesterday.&ldquo;He was also accused of being highly biased in favour of his appointing authority, that is Raila, and therefore he was not preparing objective presentations to the NCC.&rdquo;Ndii, an Oxford University scholar and popular columnist, was nominated to the technical committee by Raila&rsquo;s ODM.His backers say, however, that he is a target of malicious people who are hell-bent on ensuring that their party bosses become the NASA flagbearer.Ameyo, who represents Musalia Mudavadi in the key committee, has reportedly been isolated by his colleagues for allegedly bulldozing the team.No report on flagbearerAccording to the earlier schedule, the NASA principals &mdash; Raila, Mudavadi, Wetang&rsquo;ula and Kalonzo Musyoka were set for a three-day retreat beginning Monday this week.The retreat has been postponed. No new date has been set.It is said that the NCC and the technical committee had no report to present to the principals despite earlier indications that a deal had been struck.&ldquo;Without a complete report what will the principals discuss? The technical committee and the coordinating committee have let down the principals,&rdquo; a source familiar with the details lamented.Odm vs AncSigns of trouble in NASA emerged last week after ODM secretary general Agnes Zani and her ANC counterpart Godfrey Osotsi engaged in a nasty war of words.Osotsi had accused ODM of &ldquo;bad manners, acting in bad faith&rdquo; and employing what he termed &ldquo;dirty propaganda leaks&rdquo;.This was after Zani confirmed that NCC had named Raila as the presidential candidate and Kalonzo as his running mate.Mudavadi was allegedly designated chief minister, while Wetang&rsquo;ula was to be National Assembly Speaker.&ldquo;We are outraged &mdash; and Zani ought to know &mdash; admission by ODM that it is responsible for dirty propaganda leaks undermines the credibility and integrity of the NASA process. This level of arrogance shouldn&rsquo;t be entertained,&rdquo; Osotsi said last week.There are, however, allegations that Wetang&rsquo;ula could be planning to defend his senator post if he misses the top NASA slots.His Ford Kenya Party did not present any candidates for nomination in an area considered his backyard.
