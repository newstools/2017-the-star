We hope that the voting material have been secured."But Ojaamong accused Otuoma of using Jubilee during campaigns."Otuoma is a Jubilee candidate. There is full proof evidence ... I have not seen the leaflets [but] whether they come out or not, the fact remains," the Governor said.Nominations were momentarily delayed due to lack of ballot papers. The process which was to start at 6am had not yet started by 9am over lack of ballot papers.Residents appeared to be confused, while some seemed exhausted and annoyed by the lack of coordination in the process.A spot check by the Star found that officials and agents had not arrived at the centres by 7am.But ODM issued a statement saying there was a mix up in the delivery of nomination materials in Teso North and Teso South causing the delay in the two constituencies.More on this: Busia ODM primaries delayed over lack of ballot papersRead: ODM nominations will be done through secret ballot, says elections board
