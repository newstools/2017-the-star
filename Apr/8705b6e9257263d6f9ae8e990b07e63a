Deputy President William Ruto has been accused of undermining and insulting Kipsigis politicians because &ldquo;he perceives them as a threat.&rdquo;Bomet Governor and Chama Cha Mashinani party leader Isaac Rutto said the DP and a group of politicians are working round the clock to ensure the downfall of popular leaders from the South Rift region.He made the remarks during a series of rallies in Sogoo, Olmegenyu and Rongena in Narok county on Saturday.&ldquo;Why is it the DP has been traversing the South Rift insulting elected leaders yet he expects the community to support Jubilee at the next general election?&rdquo; Rutto said.He said leaders from the North Rift have tried to destroy the careers of those from the South Rift for decades.&ldquo;For how long are we going to sit back and watch as they undermine and trample on us? Why do they want us to kneel before them? Enough is enough. We will face them head-on,&rdquo; Rutto said.He added, &ldquo;It is surprising that over the years they have used members of the Kipsigis community as voting tools then dump them after they have been elected. This being an election period, they have come to perfect their art.&rdquo;The Deputy President is embroiled in turf wars with Rutto, Kuresoi South MP Zakayo Cheruiyot, Emurua Dikirr MP Johana Ng&rsquo;eno and Kanu secretary general Nick Salat.Former Cabinet Minister Kipkalya Kones, Prof Jonathan Ng&rsquo;eno, Dr Taaitta Towett and former National Assembly speaker Moses Keino, all deceased, are some of the Kipsigis leaders who had their promising political careers cut short in what are believed to be machinations by moneyed politicians from the North Rift.In the North Rift region, Ruto is also engaged in a political duel with Baringo Senator and Kanu chairman Gideon Moi.Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen on Saturday accused Rutto of trying to divide members of the Kalenjin community through his CCM.&ldquo;Governor Rutto wants to mislead members of the Kalenjin community into leaving Jubilee and joining NASA. We will ensure his attempts do not work, for the good of the people,&rdquo; Murkomen stated.Kericho Governor Paul Chepkwony said members of the Kalenjin community will rally behind Ruto until he ascends to the presidency.&ldquo;The Kalenjins only have one centre of power revolving around the DP. We should not lie to ourselves there are two centres of power,&rdquo; he said.Chepkwony said members of the Kipsigis community will back Jubilee in August and in 2022, when Ruto runs for President.On the Mau Forest question, Rutto accused the Jubilee government of failing to honour its 2013 election pledge to resettle evictees.He said it is unfortunate the caveat imposed on title deeds in the region has not been lifted and the people are still suffering and living in poverty.The governor alleged there are fresh evictions being conducted by the government in the Ndoinet area.
