Food security in Wajir county will improve in the next two months following the onset of heavy rains, a report says.According to a Meteorological report for Wajir county, the rains which began last week, will see improved pasture, which will in turn save cattle, goats and camels that were on the verge of dying.This comes after a prolonged dry spell that has lasted three months due to a delay in the onset of the long rains. The drought has led to loss of livestock and many residents and animals face starvation.Wajir meteorological officer John Wanjohi said last week&rsquo;s rain is not enough to satisfy the water needs of the county.&ldquo;Although some traces of rain were received in some parts of the county in March, the long delayed rains which started falling in the first week of April should provide the impetus for the socio-economic recovery and sustenance of the county after the drought period,&rdquo; he said.Wanjohi said he hopes the rains will surpass last year&rsquo;s 75mm and favourably compare with the 119.5mm experienced in 2015.South Wajir livestock production officer Julius Mwangi said animals have undergone a lot of strain in the last three months.&ldquo;Currently, the body conditions of livestock in livelihood zones range from fair to poor, with most of livestock species having emaciated bodies with thin skins,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;The body condition of all species have deteriorated due to the prolonged dry spell since water and pasture have been depleted.&rdquo;However, the national and county governments have taken steps to prevent massive losses, with farmers being encouraged to sell their animals.These include emergency destocking of frail livestock which is taken up by the Kenya Meat Commission and farmers paid. The livestock is then slaughtered and the meat distributed to drought affected households.National Disaster Management Authority Wajir county director Ahmed Hassan said the programme also involves provision of livestock feed, fodder production and conservation campaigns.&ldquo;It involves provision of 100,000 tonnes of livestock feed to core breeding herds in the county,&rdquo; he added.
