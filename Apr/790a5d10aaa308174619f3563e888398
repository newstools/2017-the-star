The battle lines have been drawn between Jubilee and NASA for the governor, woman representative and Senate seats in Mombasa after the conclusion of party primaries.Jubilee&rsquo;s lineup includes Suleiman Shahbal, Amina Abdhalla and Abdulsalam Kassim for governor, woman representative and senator respectively.Mombasa Deputy Governor Hazel Katana, who sought the JP ticket for Senator, has said she will appeal after loss to Kassim.&ldquo;I am the best candidate to take on the opposition, but some people rigged me out,&rdquo; she said in Mvita on Thursday.Katana, who ditched ODM in January citing frustration from Governor Hassan Joho, garnered 9,924 votes against Kassim&rsquo;s 10,797.The NASA lineup includes Joho and Senator Hassan Omar, who are seeking the governor seat.Jubilee is banking on Joho and Omar&rsquo;s rivalry to win the governor seat.Joho and Omar are expected to split the votes from the Kamba, Luo, Luhya, Swahili and Mijikenda communities which support the opposition.Jubilee is likely to get a share of the Mijikenda vote by having the lawyer Ananiah Mwaboza as Shahbal&rsquo;s running mate.Joho is expected to choose a Mijikenda as his running mate after Katana ditched ODM.The NASA Senate ticket is also still in contention after Hamisi Mwaguya and Mohammed Faki declared themselves the winners of the ODM ticket.In Wiper, Lawrence Kisilu will carry the flag after defeating Kongowea MCA Jabess Oduor during the primaries on April 18.For the woman representative seat, Jubilee&rsquo;s Abdhalla, Asha Hussein (ODM) and Zamzam Mohamed (Wiper) will battle for the seat.Abdhalla won the JP ticket after garnering 10,057 votes.
