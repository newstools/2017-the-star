Independent candidates are in a rush to secure certificates of clearance as the May 7 deadline draws near.Yesterday, the candidates flocked the Office of Registrar of Political Parties, to secure the certificate to be eligible to run for office on August 8.For one to run as an independent they must write an application letter of request for clearance, provide a copy of one&rsquo;s ID and pay a fee of Sh500. The candidates then receive clearance certificates, certifying they have not been members of any political party for 90 days before Election Day.&ldquo;The letter is required to have our name on it and the seat that we are vying for before we get the certificate of registration,&rdquo; David Ogeto, an MCA independent candidate in Kisii county, told the Star.The candidates, however, criticised the electoral commission and the Registrar of Political Parties for what they said was slow processing of documents.Ogeto said the IEBC frustrates the candidates by withholding information. &ldquo;The RPP is very slow and can send you back and forth to fetch some documents. They have not specified the number of documents they need,&rdquo; he said.Currently, the number of independent candidates has risen to 1,300, as more aspirants who lost in the primaries seek to be on the ballot in August.Among senior resignations from parties include Paul Otuoma, who quit after failing to clinch the ODM party ticket for Busia governor. Wiper chairman David Musila also resigned after losing in the nominations for Kitui governor. Both are expected to vie as independents.
