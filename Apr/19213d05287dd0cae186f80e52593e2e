Tanzanian rapper Nay Wa Mitego has come out to say that he fears for his life days after he was released from jail. The rapper spent a few days behind bars for allegedly insulting the Tanzanian President John Magufuli in his new song, Wapo.Nay Wa Mitego then met Magufuli on Friday and what happened next was an Intagram post, where he said his life was in danger.&ldquo;Usalama wa Maisha yangu umekua mdogo kwasasa, wana panga kunipoteza ikibidi nisiwepo kabisa kwenye hii dunia. Nipo tayari kwa chochote wanacho panga kufanya coz sijajipanga kupambana nao. Mimi ni mwana muziki si vingine. Kwa chochote kitachotokea familia yangu itakua na chakuongea. Siwezi kuhama nchi wala kukimbia nitafia hapa hapa. Na siko tayari kupindisha chochote! Nyie ndo mtanilinda. Sina mlinzi na sitarajii kua na mlinzi. Only God! (I fear for my own safety at the moment. They plan to remove me completely from this world. If anything happens my family is in the know. I will not flee my country in fear, I&rsquo;m ready to die right here. Only God can protect me!)&rdquo;
