Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo has called for seizure of six Siaya county vehicles he says are used for Governor Cornel Rasanga&rsquo;s reelection campaign.He said the vehicles, number plates removed to conceal their ownership, are used with full knowledge of county security chiefs.Midiwo said the vehicles are being used to ferry goons and dangerous weapons and to conduct illegal business.But county secretary Dave Anyona dismissed the claims as propaganda fuelled by Rasanga&rsquo;s critics.&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t talk about the matter, as it&rsquo;s not true. I&rsquo;ve not seen anywhere or reports supporting the claims,&rdquo; Anyona told the Star on the phone yesterday.Midiwo spoke on Saturday in Dibuoro Primary Shool in Alego-Usonga.He said misuse of public resources in campaigns endangers residents&rsquo; well-being and it&rsquo;s difficult to hold culprits to account.Midiwo urged the youth to impound any vehicle without a number plate and hand it over to police. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve taken this up with police and others and hope quick action will be taken,&rdquo; he said.Midiwo also accused the county of frustrating efforts to educate needy children by refusing to release bursaries, despite the assembly&rsquo;s approval.He said Sh75 million was allocated, but it was irregularly spent to fund Rasanga&rsquo;s reelection.Midiwo supports Rarieda MP Nicholas Gumbo for governor. Others seeking to remove Rasanga are businessman William Oduol and former regional development PS Carey Orege.
