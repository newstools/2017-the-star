Balambala MP aspirant Abdi Omar Shurie has denied claims that he is an outsider imposed on the electorate by clan elders.He said he comes from the area and his family is part of the Abduwak clan.&ldquo;Within our families and communities there are no boundaries. I can live anywhere. When somebody says I am an outsider, he is trying to look for cheap propaganda,&rdquo; Shurie said.&ldquo;If I felt I was an outsider and did not belong here, then I would not be here and I doubt if the Council of Elders would have proposed that I run for Balambala MP.&rdquo;Shurie wants to run on the Jubilee Party ticket.Speaking on Monday in Balich, Balambala, during a graduation ceremony, he said incumbent Abdikadir Aden claims that he is an outsider show he does not understand the constituency.Shurie was among the candidates endorsed by the Abduwak Council of Elders in December last year, but Aden has refused to step down in his favour.Ali Korane was also chosen to run for Garissa governor, Anab Subow for woman representative, Aden Duale to defend his Garissa Township MP post and Barre Shill to also defend his Fafi MP post.The elders asked the community to back the leaders they have endorsed.Shurie said Jubilee has already bagged the seat and the August 8 election is just a formality.He said Aden has not solved problems in the constituency, but he will ensure improved quality of education, reduction of poverty and the resolution of other socio-economic problems.
