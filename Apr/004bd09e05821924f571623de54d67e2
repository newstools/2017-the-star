The trademarks registrar has approved the use of the NASA acronym, not for the Opposition, but the Northern Advocacy for Sustainable Agriculture.The Kenya Industrial Property Institute noted this in a letter to the NGO through one Martin Nkaari.&ldquo;Your application has been received, examined and approved. It is now proceeding for advertisement in the Industrial Property Journal," said registrar Leonard Kosgei.The NGO is now expected to pay an advertisement fee of Sh3,000 and a registration fee of Sh2,000.The organisation registered in 2016 moved to court barring the Opposition from having the acronym registered as a political name.Members of the alliance are ODM's Raila Odinga, Wiper's Kalonzo Musyoka, Ford Kenya's Moses Wetang'ula and Musalia Mudavadi of Amani National Congress.The alliance was Mudavadi's brainchild and will be used to take on President Uhuru Kenyatta in the August 8 general election.But Raila dismissed the issue as inconsequential and said it does not bother them."We have Jubilee Insurance and Jubilee Market Kisumu. The NASA trademark order by KIPI is inconsequential. We will deal with it politically," Raila said.Earlier in the week, former ODM secretary general Ababu Namwamba said NASA was using his party's symbol illegally.Ababu defected from Raila's ODM to become the leader of Labour Party which has committed to support President Uhuru's re-election against NASA.What remains to be seen is the action the leaders will take amid pressure to name its flag bearer.The right to the acronym has been given to the NGO but a legal battle looms as only a court order can bar the Opposition from using it.With the trademark, the NGO may have an easier time arguing its case but the Opposition has said it will not back down.Read: Mudavadi, Raila, Gideon kick off 2017 alliance talksAlso read: NASA unveils team of 12 to register, identify flag bearer for election
