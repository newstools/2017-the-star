Voters in Jakarta are choosing a governor in a run-off election, that has been called "the dirtiest and most divisive" in Indonesia.Polls suggest it is a close race between incumbent Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, a Christian, and Anies Rasyid Baswedan, a Muslim.Security is tight in the Indonesian capital amid heightened racial and religious tensions.Purnama won the first round, but not by enough of a margin.BBC Indonesian editor Rebecca Henschke says that though extra security officers have been deployed to polling stations, the mood in the capital is not overly tense and there is still a festive atmosphere.The tensions were sparked by a controversy surrounding Purnama, who is accused of mocking a Koranic verse for which he is on trial for blasphemy. He has denied the charges.Purnama, also popularly known as "Ahok", voted with his family at a polling station in north Jakarta early on Wednesday morning.He told reporters: "Jakartans must use their voice as the future of Jakarta is in their hands. Don't be afraid, the police are here providing security."A coalition of hardline Islamic groups supporting Mr Basedan said it was deploying at least 100 monitors at each polling station across the capital.Rizieq Shihab, leader of the Islamic Defenders Front which has been leading protests against Mr Purnama, has also cast his vote.Asked by the BBC if his group was damaging Indonesia's pluralist democracy, he said: "Democracy doesn't stop someone from voting for a person from the same religion as you.... Christian vote for Christian, Muslims vote for Muslim."
