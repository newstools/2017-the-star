President Uhuru Kenyatta yesterday made a case for his reelection by showcasing what his administration has achieved in the past four years.The President said his primary duty is to create a conducive environment that will enable Kenyans realise their full potential, improve lives, and transform the country.&ldquo;My vision is to have an all-inclusive and stable Kenya where every single Kenyan feels they have a caring government that inspires hope and not negative ethnicity,&rdquo; President Kenyatta said.The President was at the Kenyatta International Convention Centre, where he launched a public information portal www.delivery.go.ke that showcases his administration&rsquo;s investments in projects across the country.&ldquo;I know we are not there yet but we have laid the foundation of what should be done to get there,&rdquo; President Kenyatta said.The portal will help Kenyans discern the truth from propaganda peddled by the opposition to malign the government&rsquo;s achievement in the short span of four years.Through the portal, Kenyans can access all the information on the projects the government has implemented since 2013. Any queries will be answered initially in 48 hours and eventually in 12 hours.President Kenyatta said the portal consolidates all the information in one place and makes it accessible to all.&ldquo;For the first time, we have decided to use technology to showcase the achievements we have made in the last four years. This portal has detailed information on all the projects the government has undertaken and their status,&rdquo; he said.Responding to a question raised on government borrowing during a panel discussion, President Kenyatta defended the decision to source external financial resources to implement development projects.&ldquo;You cannot grow as a country unless you access financial resources. We have been borrowing, not for consumption but for investment to transform the lives of Kenyans and create jobs for the youth. The evidence is out there for all and sundry to see,&rdquo; the President said.He dismissed claims that the Eurobond funds were stolen saying: &ldquo;This portal will help prove how the Sh200 billion Eurobond money was used in projects across the country.&rdquo;For instance, the President said, the portal will show the road from Voi to Taveta that has been tarmacked, and the bridge from Mbita to Rusinga, among other projects.He also highlighted what his administration is doing to ensure young people exploit their talents.Kenyatta said the government has established a Sports and Culture Fund that will promote the talents of young people.&ldquo;We are also planning to put up studios across the country that will be available to the youth to enable them produce their films, music and other works of art at reasonable costs,&rdquo; the President said.He said plans are underway to provide Jua Kali artisans with equipment to enable young people produce standardised quality goods that will earn them good returns.On the question of building stadia to promote sports, Kenyatta said the government has given priority to key areas that will drive the country&rsquo;s growth. They include roads, railway lines and energy projects, but he said the construction of stadia has not been shelved. During the panel discussion, Deputy President William Ruto said the government carried out a skills audit that showed gaps in technical knowhow.To bridge this shortfall, the government will build 160 technical training institutes across the country at a cost of Sh15 billion.&ldquo;In the past, focus was on university education which only produced managers. But the skills audit showed the need for increased human resource at technical level. That explains our huge investment in the technical training institutes,&rdquo; the Deputy President said.He said he is proud that under President Kenyatta&rsquo;s leadership, there has been a paradigm shift where focus is no longer on people and their ethnic background, but what they can do to move the country forward.&ldquo;We have succeeded in shifting attention from ethnicity to development,&rdquo; the DP said. He said Kenyans will vote on August 8 based on leaders&rsquo; development track record, but not on ethnicity.Deputy chief of staff Nzioka Waita said the portal will tell Kenya&rsquo;s untold story of achievements.
