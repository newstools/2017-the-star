A section of ANC politicians have opposed the proposed NASA line-up, which places ODM&rsquo;s Raila Odinga as the flagbearer and Wiper&rsquo;s Kalonzo Musyoka as his running mate.They said on Saturday the &ldquo;Cord line -up&rdquo; lost in 2013, adding that, &ldquo;No Mudavadi no NASA.&rdquo; The leaders included MPs Alfred Agoi (Sabatia), Yusuf Chanzu, (Vihiga) Vihiga assembly speaker Dan Chitwa, MCAs Abdallah Chogo (Central Maragoli), Cleophas Malala (Mahiakalo), Albert Wetundu (Shirungu Mungai) and Venna Kaisha (Nominated). Agoi said Mudavadi is NASA&rsquo;s strategic candidate and will deliver victory by 10am if given the opportunity to fly its flag. He said NASA cannot get the Luhya votes without having Mudavadi in its equation.&ldquo;The two cannot get 80 per cent of the votes from this region without involving Mudavadi and Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula, who are the way to the heart of the Luhyas,&rdquo; Agoi said.&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want a strong candidate. We want a strategic candidate. Raila should help us take President Uhuru Kenyatta home. That&rsquo;s the reason we formed NASA.&rdquo; Wetundu said, &ldquo;Raila is a perennial loser, I will not wake up in the morning to vote for him.&rdquo;The sentiments were shared by Malala and Chitwa. Chitwa added that he will not vote for Raila or Uhuru.Chanzu said Raila should help take the Jubilee administration home.However, in a quick rejoinder, Mudavadi urged leaders who are supporting NASA to calm down and be ready to support whoever will be flagbearer.He said the mandate of picking the presidential candidate should be left to the committee selected to deal with it.Mudavadi told leaders to avoid remarks that may divide the coalition, saying the NASA fraternity, not its candidate, will send JP home.
