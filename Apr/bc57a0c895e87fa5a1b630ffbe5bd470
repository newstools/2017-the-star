Pupils in remote areas of Wajir county can now study in the evenings, thanks to more than 2,000 solar lanterns distributed, free of charge, by a private organisation. The project was launched by Centres for Health and Education Programmes to light up homes with schoolgoing children, after it emerged about 65 per cent, or 450,000, in the county had no access to electricity.&ldquo;The majority of the residents with no access to electricity rely on kerosene lamps, candles and battery powered torches, which are dangerous and pollute the environment,&rdquo; CHEPs operations officer Aisha Omar said.She said the types of fuel used for lighting are generally of poor quality and expensive, and many households cannot afford them.Omar said harmful fuel or lack of it hampers after-school studies.Speaking to the press in Wajir town on Wednesday, Omar said kerosene lamps limit hours of study because fuel consumption is high, and they give out dim light and smoke.The programme, themed One Child One Solar Lamp, mainly targets children from poor families. &ldquo;There is also the issue of parents&rsquo; inability or unwillingness to purchase kerosene,&rdquo; Omar said.Jogbaru Primary School head teacher Ibrahim Ali concurred with Omar, adding the fuel emissions hurt eyes and when inhaled are harmful to the lungs.&ldquo;The provision of solar lamps has had a positive impact on learning since students can study more at night and complete their homework on time. Unlike kerosene, solar light is free,&rdquo; the head teacher said.&ldquo;Jogbaru Primary School is living proof of the miracles a small solar lamp can do. Our KCPE candidates last year performed satisfactorily in the national examinations by registering a 203 mean score compared to 121 the previous year,&rdquo; Ali said.
