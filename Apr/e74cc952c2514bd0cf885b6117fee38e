Flanked by three wives and 14 children, three married Catholic priests have been ordained in Nyeri by a splinter church at odds with Rome.One father and two deacons were ordained on Thursday by Renewed Universal Catholic Church Mt Kenya region Archbishop Peter Njogu. They are Fr Mathew Theuri, 70, and deacons Jacob Dida, 40, and Phillip Muiga, 75. The ceremony was held at the Gachatha church in Tetu.The three are the latest of a number of married priests ordained by this church.The clerics&rsquo; families stood by them as they took their vows. Theuri had his wife Nancy Waheti and seven children beside him.Dida&rsquo;s wife Jecinta Thenya and his two children stood beside him, while Muiga&rsquo;s wife Octavia Wangari and their five children were by his side. The archbishop said it is only fair to allow women to marry priests instead of engaging in illicit sexual affairs.The priests, who were earlier in the mainstream Catholic Church, said they are happy to be accepted.The archbishop said, &ldquo;Denying the fathers their right is unnatural and ungodly. The times of mandatory celibacy are gone.&rdquo;He added, &ldquo;Africans should also welcome this new move of Catholic priests instead of engaging in illicit affairs as is the case currently.&rdquo;The church has expanded to Othaya, Nyeri town, Meru, Nakuru, Tetu and Nairobi.It is planning to open other churches in Lamu and Njoro.&ldquo;Other churches are being led by men of God who have families and their families are proud of it. The wife and the children are proud knowing they have a head of the family who serves God,&rdquo; Njogu said.The Reformed Catholic Church has followers in many countries, including Uganda, South Africa, Europe and Asia.Celibacy is required by the Catholic Church.Only unmarried men are ordained to the priesthood.
