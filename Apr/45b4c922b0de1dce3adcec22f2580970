Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto&rsquo;s decision to join the opposition NASA alliance has fatally complicated his reelection hopes, and boosted Jubilee&rsquo;s chances of reclaiming full control of the South Rift from the abrasive politician.The implications will be directly felt in the Bomet governor race, and in Deputy President William Ruto&rsquo;s influence across the Kalenjin constituency in the Rift Valley.Although Rutto has long warmed up to the opposition since falling out with DP Ruto soon after the 2013 general election, his move to join NASA was unexpected, even among his supporters. It might sound simplistic to suggest that his hopes of winning the August 8 election have been irreparably ruined, but it is increasingly looking like the odds are now stuck against him.The founder of the Chama Cha Mashinani has suggested he hopes to bring 1.5 million votes across Rift Valley to NASA, although his detractors say he will not muster a few thousand votes for the opposition, perhaps a few hundred.SHOCK DEFECTIONRutto&rsquo;s decision to join NASA with his CCM party came as a shocker, although he had always maintained a soft spot for the opposition, especially former Prime Minister Raila Odinga.Some of the governor&rsquo;s supporters told me this week that there were not sure whether they would continue to support him. Others said they would not vote for him after the move.Others, however, defended the decision on local language radio stations, saying the Jubilee government has mistreated the county chief and it was appropriate for him to change camps.&ldquo;The hue and cry I am hearing from supports and distractors&hellip; that Rutto&rsquo;s switch to NASA is detrimental to his career is misplaced,&rdquo; an aide to the governor commented.There have been several social media posts from users suggesting that the move had made it easy for residents to vote for Jubilee in August.IRRECONCONCILIABLE DIFFERENCESGovernor Rutto&rsquo;s journey out of URP &mdash; an outfit that sponsored him in 2013 &mdash; started soon after the poll.Initial differences started with accusations by DP&rsquo;s supporters that the governor was undermining URP, by meeting Kanu officials.The row escalated into a power struggle, with the governor accusing the DP of political intolerance and abusing elected leaders.&ldquo;The DP is a roaming dictator Kenyans should take note of,&rdquo; Rutto was quoted in early 2015. In reaction, an aide of the DP dismissed the governor as a village elder, who suffers from attention disorder. Later, Rutto said the Deputy President was undermining counties. Somehow, the message resonated with residents and at one point, it was felt that the agenda was succeeding, even threatening DP Ruto&rsquo;s popularity across the Rift Valley.The campaign for more resources lost steam after recent audits indicated massive corruption had marred the performance of the devolved units. It was clear that the differences between the two were irreconcilable when the Bomet chief formed CCM.With neither side willing to compromise, there was no future working relationship. AUGUST ELECTIONSBut joining the opposition NASA was still an unusual move for Governor Rutto. A recent poll said more than 70 per cent of the residents supported Jubilee. It was largely expected that Rutto would support President Uhuru Kenyatta but contest for reelection on his CCM ticket. Such a plan was going to extremely complicate Jubilee&rsquo;s strategy in the governor race, and possibly give the incumbent very strong chances.After nomination polls close and nominees passed on to electoral commission, it is expected that the DP will arrive in Bomet county to put to the people the options they have ahead of the polls &mdash; to remain in government or join the opposition.Ruto&rsquo;s 2022 presidential bid will become a rallying call for the Kalenjin community to remain in Jubilee.While campaigning to rally the Kipsigis to support Jubilee, DP Ruto&rsquo;s national campaign message &mdash; that the opposition is disillusioned and directionless &mdash; will come in handy.Such a message will be a major boost for Jubilee candidates. The biggest winner will be the governor candidate, whose chances in this election will be significantly boosted. Sotik MP and National Assembly Deputy Speaker Joyce Laboso remains the favourite to win the Jubilee nomination, according to a recent poll.If she will be the candidate, then recent campaign attacks from Rutto&rsquo;s supporters against her would have been effectively silenced. She has been targetted as undeserving of the seat because of her marriage to a Luo.By joining up with Raila, a Luo, Rutto&rsquo;s supporters would struggle to justify misogynistic attacks against Laboso.Meanwhile, CCM candidates, and to some level independent candidates, will be the main losers in Rutto&rsquo;s political move. It is doubtful any CCM candidate will be elected in the South Rift, where the party will be sponsoring candidates.Some CCM candidates were hoping to win seats by campaigning for Jubilee and President Uhuru&rsquo;s reelection. But now, the Jubilee machine will amplify the political schism and simplify that the race would be between the opposition and the government.Suggestions that in joining NASA, Rutto is seeking a place remain relevant in national politics after losing the August elections, are a bit farfetched.DP RUTO GAME PLANThe defection has given the DP Ruto better prospects of sending his political nemesis into political obscurity.For the DP, getting his namesake defeated in the election is absolutely crucial to his 2022 presidential bid.Rutto has been a thorn on the backside of the Deputy President &mdash; a former close ally who, with him, received political orientation in the dying years of President Daniel Moi&rsquo;s years in power. Ruto hopes to rally his home constituency in the Rift Valley to provide core support as he tries his hand in the 2002 presidential race. Unity at home will be key in this journey.Besides the home support, the thinking within DP&rsquo;s camp is that he will court political orphans left behind by NASA, assuming they lose in August.RAILA HARD SELLNo one really can say if there is any tangible thing that Rutto will be offering NASA. He told Citizen TV on Wednesday night that brings forth fresh perspective: Perhaps nothing more. If Raila is nominated as NASA flagbearer, Rutto will struggle hard to sell the historic candidate.I have written in the past that Raila lost the Kalenjin Rift Valley constituency after the 2007 poll. Two issues, among others, contributed to the loss of the region &mdash; Mau Forest evictions and his comments that the 2007-08 violence was planned.A campaign for the opposition is likely to revive the disappointment that greeted the Kalenjin, who to a man supported Raila in 2007, only to later feel sidelined when he became Prime Minister.It is easy to stir distress over Raila by mentioning the International Criminal Court, where two Kalenjins &mdash; DP Ruto and Joshua arap Sang &mdash; alongside Uhuru were prosecuted before their cases were dropped. While the former Prime Minister generally said his party did not plan the violence, some people believe he did not speak up loud enough in support of Ruto and Sang. When he spoke, his message was cacophonic. And when it was clear, it seemed to support the ICC narrative that the violence was planned.Having indicated that he does not intend to be considered a NASA presidential candidate, Rutto&rsquo;s decision to formally join the opposition will heighten the fight for the hearts and votes in the Rift Valley.
