Textiles firms in the tax-free Export Processing Zones have moved the clothing exhibition to TRM mall along Thika Superhighway following &ldquo;overwhelming&rdquo; demand during the government-sponsored expo at the KICC two weeks ago. The expo at TRM runs until April 30, United Aryan EPZ&rsquo;s chairman Pankaj Bedi said. &lsquo;&rsquo;The mythical middle-class is expanding and their disposable income growing, thus Kenyans are happy to buy local clothes if they are of high quality and fairly priced,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said. Bedi said the initiative gave Kenyans the chance to access &ldquo;quality locally-made affordable clothes&rdquo; at between Sh200 to Sh600 . &ldquo;United Aryan EPZ exports clothes to 70 countries and locals buy second-hand clothes, thus we want to create awareness of wearing new cheaper clothes rather than wearing the mitumba,&rdquo; he said.
