The price of a two-kilogramme packet of maize flour is expected to fall from Sh140 to Sh115 in the next week.Treasury CS Henry Rotich yesterday said the government will buy one million bags of maize from the National Cereals and Produce Board at a cost of Sh3,000 per bag to stabilise prices, which have skyrocketted since January. &ldquo;We have zero-rated the cost of packaging, energy and transportation,&rdquo; Rotich said. His Agriculture counterpart Willy Bett said the cereals board is holding 1.3 million bags, farmers are holding 5.5 million bags and three million bags are held by traders.The two spoke during a joint press conference on the food situation at the Treasury in Nairobi.Bett said the off-take of maize from the cereals board will start early next week and farmers and traders who have been selling a 90kg bag of maize at between Sh4,000 and Sh4,800 will also be expected to start off-loading their maize to achieve the price of Sh115 per two-kilogramme packet.Rotich said a public notice has circulated for the importation of maize from Ethiopia and Mexico and it will take effect immediately. He also said white maize from Ethiopia will be open to anyone who can afford to import, while yellow maize from Mexico will only be restricted to feed millers.Maize imports from Ethiopia will sell at Sh4,300 but the state is yet to agree on the price of maize from Mexico due to logistics.Bett said the scrapping of import duty by the Treasury and the imports from Mexico, the cheapest maize available in the market, should help bring down the prices of maize flour. &ldquo;The logistics of importing maize from Mexico will not be easy and we need to be sure they have a surplus of maize as Mexico is a big consumer of maize,&rdquo; Eastern Africa Grain Council chief executive officer Gerald Masila said.
