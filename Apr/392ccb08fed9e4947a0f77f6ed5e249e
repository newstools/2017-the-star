National Assembly Education committee vice chairman Julius Melly has urged the Commission for University Education to expedite the probe into the viability of two campuses in Rwanda and Tanzania.He yesterday said the commission should consider closing the campuses owned by Kenyatta University and JKUAT in Tanzania and Kigali respectively. &ldquo;The issues raised against the two campuses are weighty and the taxpayers are waiting for answers,&rdquo; Melly said. On Monday, Education CS Fred Matiang&rsquo;i directed the CUE to act.Last year, JKUAT admitted losing Sh27 million to a director of its Rwanda campus.The university told the National Assembly Public Investments Committee how Anthony Luvanda swindled them in the guise of purchasing land for the Kigali campus.
