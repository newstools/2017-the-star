More than 30 Ugandan women have been arrested en route to the Middle East in the past two months for having fake immigration stamps, an official told journalists in Busia on Thursday on condition of anonymity. The women gained entry via the porous borders with assistance from some Kenyans, the officer said. Border security has been intensified.
