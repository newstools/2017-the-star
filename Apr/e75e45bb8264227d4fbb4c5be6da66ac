Only the four NASA co-principals can confirm who will be flagbearer, every other report is just a rumour, Wiper secretary general Hassan Omar has said.&ldquo;Whatever is not communicated by the four principals is a rumour. It cannot be said to be a genuine, authentic report,&rdquo; he said yesterday.Omar spoke during the launch of the Citizen Manifesto Initiative in Mombasa. He was reacting to reports of a fallout in the alliance. Reports have suggested there is already a lineup with ODM leader Raila Odinga as the flagbearer and Kalonzo Musyoka as his running mate.The reports suggested Amani leader Musalia Mudavadi will be chief minister, while Ford Kenya&rsquo;s Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula will be the National Assembly speaker.On Tuesday, Raila said a flagbearer is yet to be agreed upon formally. President Uhuru Kenyata and Deputy President William Ruto have been puttiing pressure on NASA to announce its flagbearer.But the NASA co-principals maintain they will name their flagbearer when they are ready to.
