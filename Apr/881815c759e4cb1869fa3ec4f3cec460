Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria has accused rivals of of tarnishing Jubilee Party&rsquo;s name by continually saying the primaries will be rigged. Addressing a meeting in Gatundu on Saturday, Kuria said President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto have assured candidates the primaries will be fair. &ldquo;Those saying nominations will not be free are free to jump ship instead of tarnishing JP&rsquo;s name,&rdquo; Kuria said.
