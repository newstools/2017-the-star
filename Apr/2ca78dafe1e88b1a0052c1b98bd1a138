Former FKF boss Sam Nyamweya has moved to court, seeking conservatory orders to stay the decision by the federation to suspend him from all football-related activities for the next 10 years.Nyamweya says being a private citizen and not a member of the Football Kenya Federation he is not bound by their Constitution and cannot be suspended. He says the decision is null and void. He also claims the suspension has brought his character and legacy as a respected and retired football administrator, locally and internationally, into disrepute.Nyamweya says he was not summoned or heard by the FKF and the act is in bad faith, since he is being targeted by the federation. &ldquo;One of the reasons for suspension is that I had a case against FKF president Nick Mwendwa, Robert Muthomi and the FKF, which is pending submissions before Justice John Mativo and the same is contemptuous and a threat to judicial authority and the right to seek legal redress,&rdquo; Nyamweya said.In the affidavit, he is seeking the court to grant him interim conservatory orders to restrain the FKF from discussing his suspension at the general meeting or any other special meeting.Nyamweya further says he filed a petition in court, where he sued the football federation among others and they also filed a preliminary injunction, which was dismissed by the court on March 21 this year.&ldquo;On the same day that their objection was dismissed, they maliciously and hurriedly convened a National Executive Committee meeting, where they resolved to suspend me from all football activities for 10 years,&rdquo; he said.Nyamweya also said the decision to suspend him was communicated to him seven days later through a letter dated March 28 via an email.He is seeking the court&rsquo;s intervention to prevent any further violations and also stop the illegality perpetuated by the FKF.Nyamweya says he has suffered ridicule and he is claiming compensation. He was suspended after it was alleged that he illegally withdrew Sh2.5 million from the federation&rsquo;s account and the verdict to suspend him was reached by the NEC.
