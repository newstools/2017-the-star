Kisii Governor James Ongwae and his Nyamira counterpart John Nyagarama are this morning expected to be questioned by the Senate&rsquo;s Public Accounts and Investments committee.They will be appearing before the watchdog committee chaired by Kisumu Senator Anyang&rsquo; Nyong&rsquo;o over audit queries raised by the Auditor General in the 2014-15 reports.Ongwae will, among other queries be expected to explain a Sh7.2 billion discrepancies as compared with the figures captured in Ifmis.He will also explain the huge bank balances in 28 accounts operated by the county government.Nyagarama will be required to answer to almost similar queries arising from the discrepancies in Ifmis and bank accounts.Most of the governors&rsquo; appear unable to explain the huge balances in numerous accounts they operate and the discrepancies in Ifmis statements.Last week on Thursday, Bungoma Governor Kenneth Lusaka was put to task over 152 accounts operated the county government.Lusaka was cornered and hard-pressed to explain why the county in 2014-15 operated 152 accounts for both the executive and the county assembly.
