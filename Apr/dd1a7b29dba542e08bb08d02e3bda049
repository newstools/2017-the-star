The Kenya National Examinations Council has temporarily stopped replacement of lost, burnt and defaced certificates.Through the communications office, the exam agency yesterday said the replacement has been halted to address challenges it has been facing in offering the service.The council, however, said those requiring new certificates can apply, and must be issued with a notification confirming they sat the examination.&ldquo;Please note that confirmation of certificate costs Sh2,320,&rdquo; reads the statement.Attempts to reach Knec to elaborate the challenges were futile, as our phone calls went unanswered.The move, however, comes at a time when some politicians are facing forgery charges involving academic papers.In October last year, Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi was charged with faking academic papers and presenting forged certificates to the electoral commission, while seeking nomination for the March 4, 2013, general election.It is said Sudi&rsquo;s forged documents include diploma certificate in business management allegedly issued by the Kenya Institute of Management and a KCSE certificate from Highway High school.Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho moved to court and blocked his arrest and prosecution over claims he forged his KCSE exam slip.The forgery claims have drawn the attention of the Independent Electoral and Boundaris Commission.The IEBC has partnered with government agencies to vet academic documents of all politicians seeking elective seats in the August 8 polls.The Constitution states governor and presidential candidates must have a degree from a recognised university.
