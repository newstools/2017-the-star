Busia Governor Sospeter Governor Ojaamong says he is popular because of the projects he has initiated and his rival Funyula MP Paul Otuoma cannot compete with him.He spoke on Friday during a meet-the-people tour of Nangina ward in his opponent Otuoma&rsquo;s home turf.&ldquo;When I was MP for Amagoro constituency I had a total of 28,000 votes compared to Otuoma who got 11,000 votes in his own area.&ldquo;His record cannot surpass mine, even a single minute. If in his familiar turf he could get less votes, then I am definitely way ahead of him. Otuoma cannot compete with me. Instead, he should walk with us so that we can give him a post in the county,&rdquo; Ojaamong said.He asked if his opponent could not manage a constituency, could he manage the entire county.&ldquo;Let him tell county residents what he has done in his area that can make him qualify to work for Busia people. He likes abusing me every time but the more he does that the more blessings I get,&rdquo; Ojaamong said.He urged Nangina residents to reelect him so he can complete the projects his administration has initiated.&ldquo;I support our brother John Obwogo as he defends his seat as MCA. He has been steadfast in discharging his duties. Let him also complete the projects he has initiated in the area,&rdquo; the governor said.Obwogo urged residents to remain peaceful during the election.&ldquo;I give you my blessings as you [Ojaamong] go for elections. I also urge you to look into the issue of contractors who do not have the ability to carry out tasks appropriately,&rdquo; he said.
