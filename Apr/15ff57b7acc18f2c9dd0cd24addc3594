In 2007, Kayole South MCA Dr Elizabeth Manyala was deployed to Somalia as a child protection officer by her then employer, Oxifam, when the country was a no-go zone.The assignment placed her at the epicentre of the armed conflicts by militants who were recruiting children [for war] and abducting aid workers like her.Working at the war-torn country when there was no government in place was precarious, as it meant literally fighting with armed militia, but Manyala says the experiences were blessings in disguise because &ldquo;that made me strong&rdquo;.SECURITY TRAINING&ldquo;I went for security training that prepared me to work in a volatile environment. I did not know, at that time, that it was preparing me for bigger things,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;Sleeping in the wilderness made me grow and know that there is the other side of life - that a woman is compelled to do something that can harden and make her strong.&rdquo;Manyala, the country&rsquo;s most-learned MCA, survived the hostilities and violence, and worked for different organisations, until she returned home in 2012.This was the time Kenya was preparing for the first elections under the new constitution promulgated in August 2010, creating six elective seats.Manyala decided to vie for the MCA seat, and the violence she had experienced in the war-front country came in handy.&ldquo;When I came here and I found it [violence], I said this is just a walk in the park,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;But I cannot compare myself with others because some of my colleagues never had that opportunity of working in the horn of Africa when it was quite volatile.&rdquo;The MCA added: &ldquo;Women who come out to vie are being seen as divorcees or women who are, in certain cultures, wayward,&rdquo; the MCA said.The chairperson of the the 47 County Women Caucus said women have abstained from politics because of heinous acts calculated to make them shy away, by a society that knows how delicate the privacy of a woman is.She said due to their physique, women cannot fight or engage in violent activities.The complexity of social and financial empowerment is another thorn in a foot of most women participating in elections because politics requires money. Lack of resources to mount victorious campaigns has crippled many women aspirants.The nature of voter bribery and the perception politicians have a lot of money have only added to the intrigues and bottlenecks women are facing.RESOURCE-BASED POLITICSSince independence, it has turned out that for you to vie in an election, you need a lot of resources.In Kenya just like many African traditional set-ups, for many a woman, ownership of property is like mirage.Even if a woman has acquired her own property, it belongs to the man because the inheritance goes with the man. &ldquo;Culturally, that property is man&rsquo;s and I cannot do anything I want to do with it. I must consult my husband, my kinsmen, and my community before I do anything; otherwise, I will be ostracised and labelled a rebel,&rdquo; Manyala said.&ldquo;And once you are labelled a rebel, you are called names, you are bound to lose your family and no wants to lose a family, because it is the unit that, through socialisation, gives you a sense of identity and belonging.&rdquo;She urged the civil society to go to the grassroots and seek out women who can make good leaders, &ldquo;empower, nurture and walk with them so that they can in future turn out to be transformational leaders&rdquo;. &ldquo;For the elite women, we saw Martha Karua tried in 2013, but even the womenfolk did not vote for her. Why, because we were indoctrinated. We said she is too proactive, what does she want?&rdquo; Manyala said.&ldquo;Because we felt that a man is up there he is in a position to defend through physique, the strength that he was endowed with at creation.&rdquo;Manyala urged the women who have made it in politics to support others to achieve their aspirations.
