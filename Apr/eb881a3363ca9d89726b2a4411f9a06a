But sources say the violence is also politically motivated.In November last year, residents and conservancy owners, who spoke to the Star on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, said police have not acted to stop the flare-up, despite threats and complaints.One source said: "The rhetoric of drought is used by politicians to justify a takeover of territory ahead of next year&rsquo;s elections. It is a dry season, not a drought.&rdquo;He added politicians are &ldquo;using cattle belonging to big men, since livestock are a great way to hide ill-gotten gains.&rdquo;The source said a senior official involved in the raid was behind the government&rsquo;s inertia in the face of the rising violence due to his ethnic affiliations.The government has deployed KDF officers and Kenya Police Reservists for disarmament and to restore peace.More on this: Laikipia locals raise concerns over violenceAlso read: The poor are the real victims of Laikipia violence
