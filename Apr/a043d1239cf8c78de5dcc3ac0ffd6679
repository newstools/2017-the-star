President Uhuru Kenyatta has set ambitious vote targets &mdash; 10 to 15 per cent above 2013 totals &mdash; for his Jubilee Party in 13 battleground counties.&ldquo;We can only do better and we can improve on 2013. The Jubilee delivery record speaks for itself,&rdquo; JP vice chairman David Murathe told the Star in an interview.Jubilee plans to use commissioning and delivery of development projects in battleground counties to win over opposition supporters. Road contractors, for example, are working overtime so Uhuru can unveil projects or demonstrate significant progress.The combat counties are Nairobi, Bungoma, Garissa, Isiolo, Kajiado, Kisii, Marsabit, Narok, Nyamira, Samburu, Trans Nzoia, Turkana and Wajir.They have nearly five million votes and JP wants at least two-thirds of the votes to add to those what it considers 17 core Jubilee zones.Murathe and nominated MP Beatrice Elachi, both on the NEC, separately described the plan and said it can work.The vote-target strategy is part of the wider JP campaign battle plan that has zoned the country into strongholds, battlegrounds and NASA zones. NASA has done the same.Strategists also say the opposition anxiety and speculation caused by NASA's delay in naming a candidate can help win over some opposition zones.In 2013, ODM leader Raila Odinga marginally beat Uhuru in eight of the 13 counties, and Jubilee wants to reverse this on August 8.Publicly the party has been economical with strategy details but Murathe and Elachi confirm aspects of the plan to win the battlegrounds.Murathe said the strategy has been tailor-made for different areas, appealing to different interests and issues.&ldquo;With the last voter registration results in, and additional harvesting from swing and previously Cord voting areas, we expect to defeat NASA by more than 2.5 million votes. This way the outcome will be undisputed, thereby guaranteeing a peaceful conclusion of elections, which even the most skeptical NASA fanatics will concede,&rdquo; Murathe said.In mid-January last year, DP William Ruto said Jubilee aims to win by four million votes.Last week, National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale said Jubilee will defeat NASA by at least three million votes from Kiambu, Meru and Nakuru.&ldquo;Under Jubilee, the country has seen tremendous progress and we are confident," Murathe said. "In Kisii we are looking at over 50 per cent, in Bungoma over 60 per cent and Marsabit over 70 per cent," he said.Separately, Elachi told the Star she could not disclose "our finer plan since we are in competition."But we are confident we will win with a bigger margin. We can't be afraid of NASA since we have focused on issues and numbers."She added Jubilee was not repeating the mistake of 2013 when it only aimed for 50 per cent plus one. This time it's aiming high."Every county has unique issues. And our campaign will remain focused on the issues. Let us not be like our competitors campaigning in a way that can create violence hot spots," Elachi said.She added, "The President has a good record to win votes. Kenyans are good people and will vote for people who have served them. We might not have achieved everything and it's good if we can own up and give the reasons."Uhuru advisers say both Jubilee and NASA have 17 counties as their strongholds.Jubilee strategists claim Baringo, Bomet, Elgeyo Marakwet, Embu, Kiambu, Kirinyaga, Kericho, Laikipia, Meru, Muranga, Nakuru, Nandi, Nyandarua, Nyeri, Tharaka Nithi, Uasin Gishu and West Pokot,NASA core counties are Mombasa, Bungoma, Busia, Homa Bay, Kakamega, Kisumu, Kilifi, Kitui, Kwale, Lamu, Machakos, Makueni, Migori, Taita Taveta, Tana River and Siaya.In 2013, Uhuru won the majority vote in 21 counties, Raila won in 26 counties, plus the diaspora with 15,254 votes.The strategy is supported by 20-member teams at ward and county levels to manage logistics and mobilisation.They work closely with civil servants, county commissioners and THEIR deputies, assistant county commissioners, chiefs and assistant chiefs.Last year, the team used chiefs to gather viable data that is vital for the polls.The strategy aims to weaken NASA at grassroots.In a presidential election, a candidate is required to get at least 25 per cent of votes cast in each of more than half the counties.The strategy focusses on changing voters' negative perceptions of the party and administration and turning battlegrounds into JP safe zones.Propaganda is developed based on issues and on negative and positive perceptions in the 13 battlegrounds.JP both competes with the opposition on the ground and focuses on details and issues to win numbers.The team is supported by young researchers and analysts at party headquarters in Pangani.Jubilee banks on the bait of government appointments, defecting NASA politicians, luring former politicians and engaging opinion makers to win."We want to get votes in all the places we didn't get them," Elachi said. "Kenyans love consistent people and we will continue visiting the regions. Kenyans want a good environment for business and better lives. That is what President Uhuru has been working on for the last four years.",
