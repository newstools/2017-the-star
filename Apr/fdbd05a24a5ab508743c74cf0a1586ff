The credibility of the ODM register has been questioned after Lamu Governor Issa Timamy and rival Fahim Twaha's names were found in it.Timamy is in ANC while Twaha is in Jubilee.Lamu ODM organising secretary and coordinator Zahara Shee said the two might have registered as party members previously but failed to notify the party when they pulled out. The two have never been in ODM.Apart from that hitch, and some missing names, voting went on peacefully as members nominated three MCA aspirants. Youthful aspirants floored their older counterparts.
