Somali security forces clashed with a pirate gang early on Wednesday and freed nine seamen kidnapped on an Indian cargo this month, officials said.The pirates seized the dhow Al Kausar off Somalia's coast, part of a surge of attacks after years without a reported incident.The kidnappers took the crew onshore in central Galmudug state on Monday and clashed with troops two days later, the territory's minister for ports and sea transport, Burhan Warsame, said."We rescued the nine crew and they are healthy and safe," he added.Somali pirate attacks peaked with 237 in 2012 but then declined steeply after ship owners improved security measures and international naval forces stepped up patrols.But this month has seen a new rash of attacks, with two ships captured and a third rescued by Indian and Chinese forces after the crew radioed for help and locked themselves in a safe room.The Al Kausar pirates had said they were trying to force authorities to free some of their comrades imprisoned in India.
