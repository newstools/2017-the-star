Elizabeth Ongoro has said she is in ODM to stay but noted she can no longer be silent about&nbsp;intimidation and frustration. The Nominated Senator clarified on Wednesday that she had not defected as claimed by sources within the party. Read:&nbsp; Raila diehard supporter Elizabeth Ongoro ditches ODM Ongoro said she will be on the ballot whether her rivals like it or not.&nbsp; She will vie for the Ruaraka parliamentary seat on a NASA ticket. Parties in the National Super Alliance are Raila Odinga's ODM, Musalia Mudavadi's Amani, Kalonzo Musyoka's Wiper and Ford Kenya, which is led by Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang'ula. The legislator reiterated that she will not go for any other seat but noted she would not do anything to split Raila's votes. She has been the Opposition chief's&nbsp;die-hard&nbsp;supporter."I will be in NASA and I am not coming out of the race. No more intimidation. Enough is enough...enough nonsense..." she said. In her address at Orange House in Nairobi on Wednesday, the Senator accused Ruaraka MP TJ Kajwang' &nbsp;of making her life difficult and ODM of "doing nothing about it." " I have been writing letters to ODM...that Kajwang&nbsp;is after my life and they are&nbsp;doing&nbsp;nothing. Instead they are rewarding my attacker," she said. "I have been campaigning for the seat and on 14th when we were [carrying out recruitment],&nbsp; Kajwang' &nbsp;hired goons who attacked us, beat up women and destroyed vehicles," she claimed. Sources within the party said Ongoro was asked not to run for the Ruaraka parliamentary seat but refused. The sources said she turned down offers to vie for woman representative or senator.She was apparently barred from contesting on disciplinary grounds. This was after her supporters clashed with those of Kajwang' in Mathare&nbsp;on March 16,&nbsp; leaving two people dead and seven injured.

I was under siege," she said, adding she was not the&nbsp;aggressor. "...instead of this party walking the talk..&nbsp;naambiwa ya kwamba anapewa (I am told that he will be given)&nbsp;a direct ticket [while I have to]&nbsp;look for another seat," she said.ODM handed direct nominations to hundreds of politicians ranging from ward representatives to governors. The Senator had wanted to vie for Nairobi Senator but was talked into dropping the bid."Wacha niwache hiyo seat niendee seat ndogo&nbsp;(Let me drop the desire for that seat and go for a lesser one)&nbsp;for the sake of Raila and other governors," she said. Ongoro further&nbsp; claimed women aspirants were being taken for granted in ODM. "Women candidates are being&nbsp;mistreated. I&nbsp;have fought for this party for a long time but anytime I want a seat I am told to do something else," she said.&nbsp; "Let me fight this&nbsp;battle&nbsp;for the sake of women aspirants."
