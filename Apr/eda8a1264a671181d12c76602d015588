The Communication Authority has sought an explanation from Safaricom over the outage experienced on the telecommunication company&rsquo;s network on Monday morning.CA director general Francis Wangusi said they will take action on the telecoms firm if the failure was as a result of its own technical failure.The country experienced a downtime of more than two hours, which affected Safaricom&rsquo;s voice, data, SMS, M-Pesa and enterprise services."We are waiting to get an explanation of what happened. We should not have a communication breakdown in the country.""If it was a deliberate move, we are going to take action," Wangusi told journalists at the CA headquarters.According to CA, all telecommunication services should guarantee a 99.9 per cent delivery."We cannot tolerate a downtime of more than one hour," Wangusi said.Safaricom admitted having a system glitch which affected services in its network."We wish to notify the public that starting from 9.30 am, we experienced a system outage affecting a number of core services in our network," CEO Bob Collymore said in a statement."We have identified the root cause of the outage and are working to resolve this in the shortest time possible.""In the meantime, voice, data, SMS, M-Pesa and enterprise services will be available intermittently until the issue is fully resolved," Collymore said.Read: Anxiety as Safaricom suffers technical hitches, users unable to make calls, use internetAlso read: Safaricom restores services after three-hour network outage&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
