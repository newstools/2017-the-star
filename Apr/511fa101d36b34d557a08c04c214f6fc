Former Migori legislator John Pesa will run for Suna East MP as an independent candidate.Pesa lost the ODM ticket to incumbent and party leader Raila Odinga&rsquo;s golden boy Junet Mohamed. He garnered 8,671 votes against Junet&rsquo;s 14,912.Pesa claims he was rigged out. He accused the party of favouring Junet, adding he will not shelve his quest to lead the constituency again &ldquo;after being again locked out of ODM primaries in 2013&rdquo;.&ldquo;I filed an appeal with the party rejecting the nomination results but they never bothered to respond,&rdquo; Pesa said.He said the only results he will trust are those presided over by the IEBC.&ldquo;I am confident of flooring Junet in the August polls. Let him prepare to go home,&rdquo; Pesa said.The top contenders for the Suna East seat are Junet, Pesa and businessman Patrick Odipo, who won the ANC primaries against his sole rival Tom Hillary.Odipo won the ANC primaries last Wednesday when he garnered 9,239 votes against Hillary&rsquo;s 321.&ldquo;I avoided the road of shambolic nominations in the Orange party to give Suna East residents an alternative voice in the General Election. I want to put an end to the poor use of the CDF kitty,&rdquo; he said after being announced the winner.Odipo said he is sure of winning. He is riding on the &ldquo;poor development record&rdquo; of the incumbent and his alleged arrogance towards other leaders in the constituency and across the county.&ldquo;I would rate Junet&rsquo;s performance at 4 out of 10, and that is below par. We will change that on August 8,&rdquo; he said.In June last year, Inspector General Joseph Boinnet ordered six leaders, including Junet, to appear before the DCI over hate remarks.Last month, Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho and Junet were removed from ODM&rsquo;s disciplinary list.The two were among 14 leaders summoned over chaotic incidents during party events.&ldquo;The two shall not appear as earlier indicated,&rdquo; director of communications Philip Etale said.ODM issued fresh summonses for Migori Governor Okoth Obado, Ruaraka MP TJ Kajwang&rsquo; and former Rongo MP Ochillo Ayacko.Obado denied allegations he sparked the violence during which Joho&rsquo;s bodyguard was shot and injured.The chaos reportedly resulted from claims he was there to endorse Junet and Ayacko, who lost the contested ODM governor polls.Obado made good his threat to prevent ODM from holding a rally in Migori town. The rally in Posta grounds was completely disrupted.
