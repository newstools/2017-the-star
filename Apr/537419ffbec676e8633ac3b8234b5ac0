A 13-year-old girl from Kajiado county is fighting for her life after giving birth last Thursday.The minor is in a coma and currently at the ICU at Kenyatta National Hospital. She is undergoing treatment for pre-eclampsia, a condition developed during pregnancy and characterised by high blood pressure and high protein in urine.The girl developed the condition shortly after delivering a baby girl weighing 1.7kgs at Kajiado district hospital."After delivery, she developed pre-eclampsia, where one or more convulsions occur in a pregnant woman suffering from high blood pressure," KNH anaesthesis registrar Ifrah Hersi told the Star on Thursday."It is often followed by a coma, which poses a threat to the health of the mother and baby."The teenager underwent a brain operation at the weekend after her condition led to a haemorrhage."We had to take her to the theatre two days after her admission as her condition was not stable. She is yet to wake up so it's a watch-and-wait situation," Hersi told journalists.She said stable patients wake up after three or four days."If she is not stable we cannot give a timeline," the registrar said. Hersi said anyone can develop the condition as age is not a factor. She said it can be controlled by taking anti-hypertensive medication, which helps expectant mothers avoid complications after delivery.The girl's parents were not available for comment by press time.Anne Ngesa, nursing officer-in-charge of the ICU ward, said a girl with a similar condition died on April 6 after her kidneys failed."This is very worrying...something needs to be done," she said.The incidents followed a study on sex education among adolescents by Guttmacher Institute and African Population Health and Research Centre.It showed that a majority of adolescents do not know how to use contraceptives and would like to receive information on this.Hersi and Ngesa had mixed reactions to the report; the said the issue of cultural backgrounds was not sufficiently dealt with."Sometimes we have to weigh options," Hersi said. Ngesa said: "What we are seeing here is lack of knowledge. The study is more focused on people who are educated."
