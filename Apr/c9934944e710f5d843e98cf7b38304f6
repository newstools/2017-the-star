Former Nacada chairman John Mututho has announced he will vie for Nakuru governor as an independent candidate.Addressing the press in Naivasha, he termed JP nominations a sham, adding rigging was the order of the day and led to Lee Kinyanjui being declared the winner.Mututho said he will support President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s reelection.He said he was ready to respect the will of the people, but added nominations were not free and fair.&ldquo;It is clear the party primaries were marred by irregularities,&rdquo; Mututho said.He said the total votes cast for governor exceeded those of the senator and woman representative and were exaggerated.&ldquo;You can count the votes and this will tell you the disparities, which means those who voted for the governor did not vote for either the senator or the woman representative,&rdquo; Mutotho said.He accused incumbent Governor Kinuthia Mbugua and Kinyanjui of &ldquo;massive rigging&rdquo;.
