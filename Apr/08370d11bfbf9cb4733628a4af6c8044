The Nairobi NASA leadership has escalated the dispute over joint selection of candidates for elective seats in the city to the co-principals and the technical committee.NASA affiliate parties have failed to agree on joint selection of candidates for the Senate, woman representative, 17 parliamentary and 85 MCA seats.The wrangles threaten to cost the alliance the seats if they split voters in their strongholds.Governor Evans Kidero and his deputy Jonathan Mueke have called for joint primaries.Mueke on Sunday said Wiper postponed nominations scheduled for that day to today to give room for talks. He spoke at the Redeemed Evangelistic Fellowship Church in Ruaraka. Wiper has identified six parliamentary seats where it wants its candidates supported. Three of them are held by ODM elected MPs. &ldquo;We are in talks as the two major parties - ODM and Wiper - and we are also consulting Ford Kenya and ANC, just to make sure that where they have a strong candidate, the strongest party flies the NASA flag,&rdquo; Mueke said.
