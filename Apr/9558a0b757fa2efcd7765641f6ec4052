Kenya Beach Volleyball have send two teams (men and women) to the Zone Five Senior African Cup of Nations qualifier starting today at the Lido Ceach in Entebbe, Uganda. Kenya Prisons captain Ibrahim Odour and Nairobi Water James Ngala will form the men pair, having featured in the 2015 All Africa Games.Gaudencia Makokha and Jacinta Mueni, who were part of the team that participated in second round of the continental Cup in Mozambique in 2015, will fly the country&rsquo;s flag in the women&rsquo;s category.Makokha&rsquo;s inclusion to the beach team wouldn&rsquo;t have come at a better time having been dropped from the Kenya Pipeline 14-member squad which is currently competing in the ongoing Africa Women&rsquo;s Club Championship in Monastir, Tunisia. The right attacker juggles between the outdoor and indoor sport. The two pairs will come up against hosts Uganda, Rwanda, Egypt and Sudan in the one-day tournament. KBV chairman, Ben Juma, is optimistic the team will record good results.&ldquo;These players have in one way or the other participated in the recent beach competitions and they know what to do. Only four teams will qualify for the Africa Cup of Nations and we remain hopeful that we will be among the four,&rdquo; said Juma, who doubles up as the Kenya Volleyball Federation (KVF) secretary general.He added: &ldquo;Egypt and Rwanda should be our main threat. However, our players have played them before and I believe they will raise up to the occasion and post good results.&rdquo;The team is under the stewardship of Patrick Owino. Mozambique will host the Africa Cup of Nations later in the year.
