A new political outfit in Ukambani is set to be unveiled tomorrow, signalling tough times for Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka&rsquo;s key allies.New Democrats, led by businessman David Masika, will be launched tomorrow at the Boulevard Hotel, Nairobi, ahead of its grand launch in Makueni county.Masika, the ex-managing trustee of the National Social Security Fund, will face off with Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana for the county&rsquo;s top job.Masika had handed his nomination papers to run for the seat on the Wiper ticket, but made an about-turn after Kalonzo signed a deal with Kibwana&rsquo;s Muungano Party.In an interview with the Star, however, Masika said his relationship with Kalonzo remains intact and the launch of New Democrats has his blessings.&ldquo;My main reason [for decamping] is the kind of contract between the leader of Wiper and Prof Kibwana, part of which guaranteed prof Kibwana direct nominations. So in a situation like that where does that live me?&rdquo;he said.Masika said after the Wiper-Muungano deal, Kibwana went around bragging that he will decide who will run in the entire Makueni county.Masika said many candidates have lined up to run on the party&rsquo;s ticket throughout Ukambani region.This means that Wiper candidates will have to contend with New Democrats and Maendeleo Chap Chap, led by Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua.There are also claims Machakos Deputy Governor Bernard Kiala is disgruntled following last minute defection of CCU party leader Wavinya Ndeti to Wiper.Unlike Maendeleo Chap Chap, New Democrats will be affiliated to NASA and will support the coalition&rsquo;s presidential candidate.&ldquo;Definitely we would go the NASA way....I must say whatever it is that we are doing has the blessing of the leader of Wiper,&rdquo; Masika told the Star.According to the businessman, he will bring to an end the quarrels that have marred Makueni county government, and put back the devolved unit on the path of progress.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think those quarrels are going to end [soon]. You can&rsquo;t disagree with everybody,&rdquo;Masika said, alluding to the bloody infighting between Kibwana and the MCAs.
