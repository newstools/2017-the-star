Toxic industrial chemicals have been found in children&rsquo;s products being sold in Kenya.A survey conducted on children&rsquo;s products in 10 countries found widespread contamination of industrial chemicals that have been recommended for global prohibition.Short chain chlorinated paraffins are industrial chemicals primarily used in metal works, but also as flame retardants and softeners in plastics.Their harmful properties have attracted global concern. A Stockholm Convention expert committee has recommended world-wide elimination of the chemicals under the treaty.Pam Miller, from the International POPs Elimination Network, who conducted the study, said in a statement that toxic industrial chemicals should not be present in children&rsquo;s toys.The SCCPs need to be banned globally and strict enforcement should keep them out of our children&rsquo;s products and bodies, she said.Miller added that the chemicals adversely affect the kidney, liver, thyroid and are anticipated to be human carcinogens.A carcinogen is a substance capable of causing cancer in living tissue.The Centre for Environment Justice and Development, which focuses on promoting chemicals safety and sustainable development in Kenya, bought several soft plastic children products and sent them for analysis to the Czech Republic.The analysis, according to the study, found that four of them &mdash; baby bib, children sandals, jumping rope and beach ball &mdash; contained SCCPs at elevated concentrations.The world-wide survey found SCCPs to be widely present in products favoured by children, including Mickey Mouse slippers, jump ropes, balls, and plastic ducks.The study also found a hand blender commonly used to prepare baby food leaks SCCP.The study was performed by IPEN, Alaska Community Action on Toxics and Arnika.&ldquo;Governments need to step up and ban these chemical[s] without loopholes. Alternatives are available and the safest measure for workers and children is to eliminate it,&rdquo; said Jitka Strakova from Arnika.
