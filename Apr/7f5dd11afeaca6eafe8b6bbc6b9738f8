These are the programmes that will be threatened by suddenly shifting billions to fund a referendum to create phantom jobs for the three people," Esipisu said.Esipisu said having the constitutional changes within 90 days of taking office was not an easy task."Making constitutional changes that require a referendum will simply not take three months. It will take years," he said.He said money has to come from somewhere to fund the activities, adding that "the pot is not bottomless.""The country cannot afford to spend billions to please the three men, it needs to create jobs for the millions of youth who actually need them," he said.Shortly after NASA's unveiling, President Uhuru Kenyatta dismissed the lineup as a ploy to create jobs for its leading figures.Uhuru said the Opposition politicians have lost focus of what leadership means by wasting their energy on how to create positions of power for themselves rather than spending their efforts to improve the welfare of Kenyans.&ldquo;This was never about the country. It was about giving jobs for themselves instead of the millions of Kenyan who need jobs,&rdquo; he said on Thursday.More on this: Uhuru dismisses NASA lineup as 'jobs for the boys'
