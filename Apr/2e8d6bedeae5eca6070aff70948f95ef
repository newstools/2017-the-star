When now US President Donald Trump ascended on the escalator at his Trump Towers and declared Mexico was sending its drug dealers and rapists to America &mdash; as a way of reintroducing himself to the Americans and setting in motion wheels that would propel him to the presidency &mdash; most parts of the country went into shock they&rsquo;ve quite never recovered from.So much that his first 100 days in office have thus far proven right those who feared Trump was not ready and could not be ready for the big office.What most people did not know is there was a strategy behind the madness that got Trump elected as President, and part of that was tapping into the anger voters had with the so-called &ldquo;establishment,&rdquo; meaning usual politicians doing the usual stuff to please their benefactors, normally special interest lobbyists.In other words, Trump tapped into, and revved up the Republican base as well as others who shared in the anger, and didn&rsquo;t care having a traditional politician holding office as President and had all these voters voting for him, a task made easier given it was toss-up as to who American loathed the most, him or his opponent in that election &mdash; Hillary Clinton.The strategy paid off and we now have President Donald J Trump.Odd as it is for a progressive to say this, but NASA should borrow a leaf from the Trump playbook, if not the whole book altogether, to send President Uhuru Kenyatta home on August 8.This is because there are commonalities between what happened in the US and what needs to happen in Kenya.Chief among them is widespread voter dissatisfaction and anger in some cases in the country, much as it was in the United States.Indeed, the entire country to a man is fed-up with the Jubilee government and politicians who take them for granted. Always peddling lies during campaigns, only to disappear and loot, self-promote or otherwise, doing everything else that does not better the lives of these very voters they purport to represent.That&rsquo;s not to say there are not among the populace a bunch who would carry banners and go to the streets chanting slogans in favour of the same failed government and politicians. We have them and in millions, which is shame but not much can be done about that.However, there&rsquo;s much that can be done with the rest who are absolutely disenchanted or disgusted with one government after another doing little, if anything, to improve their lives. And these outnumber those, who for one reason or another but mostly blind following, wouldn&rsquo;t mind the status quo.As was the case with Trump, NASA principals need to channel this anger into a vehicle by which one of them can be elected and sworn in as President.Let&rsquo;s be realistic here: Everyone, including all the principals, knows there&rsquo;s only one person who can defeat Uhuru and that person is Raila Odinga.Question is, how does NASA anoint him without the other principals coming out of the process as lesser men?The answer is simple: Let each principal organise community leaders and invite the de facto opposition leader to come to a small gathering with them &mdash; not a rally &mdash; in which they&rsquo;re told the truth stated above and let them shower their blessings on the man and at the same time, give cover for their son to say, &ldquo;This was not about me being the lesser man but it is what my people said.&rdquo;If each of the principals does this, NASA will have flagbearer seamlessly selected and shall go on to remove Uhuru and Jubilee from power. Kenya will become the peaceful and prosperous country it has always yearned to be, only to be thwarted by the forces that have the current government in place.
