The Ministry of Devolution expressed its concern over the rising cases disputes in the counties and between the devolved units and the national governments.The ministry is now proposing that the disputes can be resolved through the intergovernmental relations act of 2012 noting that counties were using up to Sh200m to resolve the rows.This emerged when stakeholders met for a two day workshop on Alternative Disputes Resolution (ADR) workshop held in Great Rift Valley Lodge in Naivasha.According to the PS in the ministry Micah Powon, there were increased cases of disputes between different players of devolution.He noted that the conflicts impeded service delivery while the gains made were eroded by the increasing frictions in the counties between the executive and the county assemblies.&ldquo;To date many counties have challenges with having their budgets approved due to misunderstanding on the roles of each player,&rdquo; he said.Powon added that friction between Governors and MCAs had culminated in the impeachment of the former an exercise that was not helpful to the progress of devolution.&ldquo;The constitution envisaged this challenges and proposed solutions that have been clarified through the various acts of devolution including the intergovernmental relations act of 2012,&rdquo; he said.The chairman the Intergovernmental Relations Technical Committee Professor Karega Mutahi blamed the disputes to lack of ADR framework.
