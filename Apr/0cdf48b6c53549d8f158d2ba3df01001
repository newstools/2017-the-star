Radio queen Adelle Onyango got the meanest baddest boys in Kenya to talk about monthly periods, a highly taboo topic.The Kiss FM's breakfast co-host teamed up with Harlequins' David Ambunya, Pius Shiundu and Lyle Asiligwa for a vlog interview.The highlight of the shoot was learning that &ldquo;there's nothing to cringe about but everything to celebrate when it comes to periods. Also, if we open up the conversation, then girls and ladies can ask each other questions.&rdquo;Adelle continued: &ldquo;Oh man, the wrong answers. Some guys didn't know what PMS stands for, which showed how badly we've silenced convos around periods. Also meeting men who donate pads to girls who can't afford pads! That was powerful!&rdquo;&ldquo;We have made it something to be ashamed of, to hide, to talk about in closed rooms and hushed tones. When it's something to celebrate. And by having these conversations we also have to include men. Men around me claimed they feel left out because we women never involve them in the conversations. So in this episode, we strapped some rugby players in pads and quizzed them on periods. If they got the questions wrong, there were watery consequences!&rdquo; Adelle explained.
