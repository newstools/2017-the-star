Former Kenyan Premier League champions Sofapaka FC are set to have a new ground for their home matches by the end of this month.This will be a reprieve not only to Sofapaka but also to the entire KPL as it will help decongest the stadiums that are already in use.In a response to Sofapaka&rsquo;s letter on Friday, Narok County Director of Sports, Benson Kariuki, acknowledged receipt of the clubs letter and was optimistic that KPL action will grace the stadium by the end of this month.The club had written to the Narok County Government on Wednesday seeking to use the newly built Narok Stadium for their home matches.However, the stadium is not ready for use at the moment but should be ready within two weeks, according to Kariuki in the letter addressed to Sofapaka&rsquo;s secretary general Emmanuel Kayoyi.&ldquo;At the moment we are in a process of putting up the inner perimeter fence and it should be ready for use by, latest, April 29,&rdquo; Kariuki said.The green light to use the stadium awaits formal discussions between the club and the county government on the terms of engagement.Sofapaka have been using Thika Sub-County Stadium for their home matches this season.The new stadium will help ease pressure on the other stadiums that have been in use this year following the closure of Nyayo Stadium and Safaricom Stadium, Kasarani, for renovations.
