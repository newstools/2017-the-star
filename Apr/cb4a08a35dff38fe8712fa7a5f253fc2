Some of them even call her a goddess. But it&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve gotten used to and I can&rsquo;t get mad. In fact, if anything, I&rsquo;m more happy because they recognise her beauty and we&rsquo;re really close and do right about everything together. It&rsquo;s good to have that kind of mother-daughter relationship and we can talk about everything.&rdquo;Lola has never shied away from showing off her mother.Apart from being a TV presenter, Lola is also a young entrepreneur and even launched her own store, &lsquo;Zefyros By Lola&rsquo;, where she sells her own custom-made swimwear suits, clothes, shoes and Jewellery. At such a young age, Lola is proving that young ladies can make it in the business industry, despite what is portrayed of them.Asked how she raised funds for her high-end shop, Lola said: &ldquo;When I was working in KTN, I used to save a lot. Most people earn money, then blow it in a weekend, with drinks and so on. But I used to save together with help from my family. They helped build the foundation and then I went on from there.&rdquo;
