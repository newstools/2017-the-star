Samburu politicians have been told to stop hiding behind traditions when seeking votes. Nominated Senator Naisula Lesuuda said her competitors are hiding behind Samburu cultural practices to campaign against her.She is running for Samburu West MP.&ldquo;My competitors are saying that I&rsquo;m just a girl, instead of telling the people what development they have brought in the last four years. This mudslinging and sideshows should stop,&rdquo; Lesuuda said.She said the area is underdeveloped due to insecurity and blamed leaders for neglecting residents. &ldquo;In 2009, I was engaged in a peace caravan to bring together the Samburu and Pokot communities who were at war. After peace prevailed, no development projects has been brought, because of the past insecurities.&rdquo;
