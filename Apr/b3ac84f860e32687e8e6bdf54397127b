Ford Kenya has cautioned supporters of Musalia Mudavadi against issuing ultimatums in regard to the choice of NASA flag bearer.This came after Amani National Congress supporters threatened to leave NASA if Mudavadi was given an inferior position in the coalition.The supporters chanted "No Musalia, No Nasa" as they waved placards written "Chief Minister ni Wewe" at the weekend in Kakamega.This was in response to a report from the NASA technical committee which said Raila Odinga of ODM is the presidential candidate.The report, which was leaked to the media, showed that Kalonzo Musyoka of Wiper will be Raila's running mate in the August polls.Mudavadi was to get the Chief Minister position, which does not exist in the current Kenyan law, including the Constitution.Read: It's Raila-Kalonzo! NASA experts sayNASA brings together Raila (ODM), Kalonzo, Mudavadi and Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang'ula (Bungoma Senator).The principals were expected to deliberate on the matter but Mudavadi's ANC dismissed the report as being inaccurate. And in a statement on Tuesday, Ford Kenya director of communications Tim Machi said the dissent will hurt the unity of the coalition."We caution such supporters that they are unwittingly lurching onto sinister narratives hatched by enemies of the coalition," Machi said.He said whoever is chosen should be embraced by all Nasa supporters adding that "it is not for selfish gains"."No one is in this coalition in pursuit of selfish interests or personal ambitions," Machi said."As a team, we are all bound by the responsibility and civic duty to free the country from the stranglehold of Jubilee," he said.Machi said NASA will hold because the challenge of freeing Kenya was greater further urging supporters to exercise restraint and trust."We will be working to present the most practical and formidable ticket to guarantee victory come August 8, 2017," he said.Decision on coalition partnersMachi further said the decision on who flies the coalition&rsquo;s presidential flag in the election has not been made as media reports indicate."We reiterate that the decision is still work in progress. The four principals will be holding a critical retreat very soon," Machi said.Machi said that what the public heard were scenarios and suggestions of different names on the coalition&rsquo;s presidential ticket."We urge our supporters to remain calm as the principals work through a formula for sending the 'kleptocratic' Jubilee regime home," he added.Earlier, ODM secretary general Agnes Zani said NASA&rsquo;s national coordinating committee, as mandated, came up with the report after 60 days of negotiations.She earlier said the report was erroneously leaked to the media but that is was valid and existent.More on this: NASA flag bearer report 'accurate', ODM saysBut Amani secretary general Geoffrey Otsotsi said ODM's declaration that the NASA flag bearer report is valid is "bad manners" and undermines the coalition's unity.Osotsi said Amani was not aware of a formal report authored by the committee for sharing with the four principals on matters flag bearer."We are outraged - and Zani ought to know - that admission by ODM party that it is responsible for dirty propaganda leaks undermines the credibility and integrity of the NASA process," he said.More on this: Amani slams 'bad mannered' ODM over 'valid' NASA flag bearer reportPart of the leaked proposal is to create the position of a chief minister, equivalent to the powerful position of Prime Minister, who will be a first among equals in the NASA Cabinet.The position, to be occupied by Mudavadi, will have sweeping powers to whip the Cabinet and will have an expanded mandate to supervise and coordinate government business.The creation of this position would however neutralise the current powerful position of the National Assembly Majority leader held by Garissa Township MP Aden Duale.The principals, however, have created the leeway to adopt the report the way it is, or introduce amendments that will inform the pre-election coalition agreement.
