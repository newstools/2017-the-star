Thousands of Kenyan children will receive a malaria vaccine next year in a carefully controlled pilot programme.The children will be selected mostly from malaria-endemic zones in the Western region.&ldquo;The prospect of a malaria vaccine is great news. Information gathered in the pilot programme will help us make decisions on the wider use of this vaccine,&rdquo; Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa, said.He said yesterday children in Ghana and Malawi will also take part in the pilot programme to investigate whether parents bring their children back for all four doses of the vaccine.The three-year pilot phase will also investigate safety issues associated with the RTS,S vaccine, such as the potential to develop meningitis.The vaccine is ineffective against malaria unless children receive four doses spread out over 18 months.Even then, it only offers modest protection.Trials involving more than 15,000 children, between 2009 and 2014, in seven African countries, including Kenya, established that a series of four shots reduced the number of malaria cases by 36 per cent in young children and by 26 per cent in infants.Backers of the vaccine say even its modest effect could be significant because malaria kills thousands of children every year.RTS,S will be assessed as a complementary malaria control tool that could potentially be added to the core package of WHO-recommended measures for malaria prevention.Health CS Cleopa Mailu yesterday said Kenya has made great strides against malaria.&ldquo;We know Kenya has made significant progress in the control of malaria in the last 5 years. Overall, country prevalence has dropped from 11 per cent to eight per cent over that period,&rdquo; he said.The WHO pilot programme will assess whether the vaccine&rsquo;s protective effect in children aged five to 17 months during phase three testing can be replicated in real-life.Specifically, it will assess the feasibility of delivering the required four doses of RTS,S, the vaccine&rsquo;s potential role in reducing childhood deaths and its safety in routine use.The WHO said the three countries were selected because of high coverage of long-lasting insecticidal nets, well-functioning malaria and immunisation programmes, a high malaria burden even after scale-up of LLINs, and participation in the phase three RTS,S malaria vaccine trial.The vaccine will be administered through intramuscular injection and delivered through the routine national immunisation programmes.The project will cost about Sh5 billion, WHO said.
