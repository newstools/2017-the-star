Murang’a governor hopeful Moses Mwangi yesterday decamped from the Jubilee Party, hours before the nominations. He said he fears the nominations will be rigged. Tight security is in place. Mwangi did not identify the party but said it supports President Uhuru Kenyatta’s reelection. He said he has submitted his resignation and will soon announce his new home. Addressing journalists in Murang’a town, Mwangi said he has been under immense pressure from his supporters to decamp from JP as they suspect the nominations will be manipulated. He said though JP has every intention of conducting credible nominations, his rivals for the JP ticket have perfected the art of deceit and may frustrate the exercise. Mwangi said the violence experienced during JP activities in the county shows that some aspirants are hellbent on getting their way and will go to any length to win. “The party has had to deploy massive security apparatus in previous events to ensure they are peaceful,” he said. “I assure my supporters that I will be on the ballot on August 8, but I will not subject them to an exercise that will not be fair.” He said reports indicate some aspirants plan massive rigging. This comes a day after Kigumo MP and governor  aspirant Jamleck Kamau accused incumbent Mwangi Wairia of planning to print fake ballot papers to incriminate him in rigging and discredit him. Wairia has accused Kamau of being among three governor aspirants from Central who bribed some party officials to get a fake certificate. Both men deny the claims. The nominations have raised temperatures and voters eagerly await winners of tickets for governor.
