Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula has insisted NASA will not split.Yesterday, he said the party does not feel the pressure to name a presidential flagbearer.Wetang&rsquo;ula spoke in Kisii county. He said reports of an imminent split in NASA are propaganda from the Jubilee Party.Wetang&rsquo;ula dismissed as hogwash reports some leaders, among them Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka, will bolt out if they are not named flagbearer. He spoke at Nyabururu Catholic Parish, where he received Kitutu Chache South MP Richard Onyonka to the party. Wetang&rsquo;ula was accompanied by Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale and Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa.Wetang&rsquo;ula said the NASA flag bearer will be picked at the right time and not under pressure from Jubilee leaders, especially Deputy President William Ruto. &ldquo;Ruto is suffering from the hyena syndrome. He is like a hyena following us all the way salivating as he waits to see if a hand falls for him to eat,&rdquo; Wetang&rsquo;ula said.Enough time to name flagbearerHe added, &ldquo;There is enough time and nobody should dictate to us the choice of the NASA flagbearer. We are partners and at the same competitors within the alliance, but we must remain focussed and determined to achieve our goal of removing Jubilee from power.&rdquo;Khalwale asked NASA co-principals to remain focussed on their goal and ignore pressure from their supporters. He said remarks by some Wiper and ANC leaders that their leaders were best suited to be the NASA presidential flagbearer were uncalled for, adding all co-principals are equal. Khalwale told the principals not to allow propaganda to split them.Wamalwa backed Wetangula&rsquo;s presidential bid.
