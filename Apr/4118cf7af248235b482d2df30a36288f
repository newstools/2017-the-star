Funyula MP and former ODM national vice chairman Paul Otuoma has ditched the party.He has been pushing the ODM National Election Board to hand him the nomination certificate, saying he won but was rigged out by Governor Sospeter Ojaamong.Otuoma, popularly known by his supporters as Efumbukhe (forward ever, backwards never), will face Ojaamong in the August 8 general election as an independent candidate in the governor race.Ojaamong should not rejoice over his last-minute resolve to ditch the Orange party as their political duel is far from over. Ojaamong&rsquo;s chief opponent in the race allegedly garnered a lot of votes in Butula, Nambale, Matayos, Budalang&rsquo;i and Samia, except Teso North and South subcounties.The NEB nullified the nomination results. It promised to investigate claims that the exercise in the two subcounties had been flawed.No investigation has been launched. Instead, the nomination has been rescheduled for today.If Otuoma&rsquo;s victory claim against the incumbent is true, it would be proven wrong or right in the general election. Butula subcounty, the home turf of Busia Deputy Governor Kizito Wang&rsquo;alwa, overwhelmingly voted for Otuoma, who garnered more than 19,000 votes. Ojaamong only received a small fraction of the votes.Sources say the voting trend in Butula has soured the relationship between Ojaamong and Wang&rsquo;alwa.The latter has rubbished the allegation, saying their relationship is stable.Another area where the incumbent is likely to face a problem is Bunyala subcounty, the home turf of former ODM secretary general and Labour Party of Kenya leader Ababu Namwamba, also the area MP.Namwamba has been at the forefront in faulting Ojaamong&rsquo;s administration for under-development. He plans on ensuring Ojaamong and ODM get no support from Budalang&rsquo;i.The same is likely to happen in Samia subcounty, Otuoma&rsquo;s home turf, Nambale and Matayos subcounty.Otuoma&rsquo;s supporters are asking how sure Ojaamong is about winning the governor seat in August.He is said to only have votes from Teso North and South, which are perceived to be under Jubilee.Political analyst Martin Andati was yesterday interviewed on Radio Ingo. He said regardless of how hard Ojaamong will work to retain the seat, he will lose because the same people who voted in the nominations are the same who will head to the ballot in August.
