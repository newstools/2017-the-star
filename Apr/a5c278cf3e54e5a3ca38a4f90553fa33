Director of Criminal Investigations Ndegwa Muhoro has been summoned to court on April 25 in a case in which former assistant minister Betty Tett is implicated in a murder conspiracy.Senior resident magistrate Faith Mutuku wants Muhoro to explain the status of a report in the case and inform the court how far he has gone with the file. The DCI was ordered to reopen the case, after complainant Andrew White alleged that he had found damning evidence, which linked Tett to hired hitman John Linus Wachira. But despite the directive, Muhoro is yet to report to court on the progress.In her ruling, Mutuku said Wachira, who faces charges of giving false information to the police, is entitled to an expeditious trial and it is necessary to summon the DCI to explain the delay.In his report, White alleges that he obtained telephone data records of supposed conversations between Tett and Wachira.His lawyer presented the DPP with four box files of phone records together with a soft copy on disk. &ldquo;My client seeks a review of your decision to drop the conspiracy to murder charges against Betty Tett,&rdquo; his lawyer Paul Mwangi told the DPP.White says the documents prove a close association between Tett and Wachira and places them at the centre of the conspiracy. Tett was let off the hook after investigators handling the case said Wachira had wrongly implicated her and had allegedly demanded Sh3 million from White to spare his life.
