Goldox donkey slaughtering factory in Mogotio, Baringo county, opened its gates in June last year seeking to create 1,500 jobs for residents.The donkey business is one among a few investments that secured an operation licence duly signed by Governor Benjamin Cheboi.Upon the agreement deal, investor Chinese Lu Dong Lin was at liberty to open up his unexploited donkey market both in Kenya and across East and Central Africa.The factory has so far cleared over 30,000 donkeys from farmers in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, according to an employee who requested anonymity for fear of victimisation.He said a bad smell emanates from the breaking of bones, and that they are warned against speaking about it.Residents of Chemogoch in Mogotio welcomed the abbatoir hoping it would improve their lives, but now say the smell has become a nuisance and health hazard that could almost force them to migrate away from their houses.Passersby and motorists plying the Nakuru- Kabarnet road also accuse the donkey factory of producing a foul smell. Health disaster looming?The smell is believed to be caused by the effluence from the factory. Offended residents fear a health disaster is in the offing and wish the issue could be addressed promptly.&ldquo;If the owner cannot assure us of a good environment then it should be closed down immediately,&rdquo; resident Duncan Kigen told the Star at the site.He said the donkey factory&rsquo;s management has prohibited residents from entering the facility.&ldquo;Maybe they are restraining people for fear that they might reveal what is brewing inside,&rdquo; Kigen said.He said residents hold back their complaints as the company has hired several residents to work as casuals.Kigen added that scavenging birds are scattered at the factory, posing another serious health hazard to residents.He said the birds&rsquo; white paste-like droppings corrode their roofs, leaving them dirty and forcing them to refrain from harvesting rainwater.The dirty tree shades patching the birds are also not welcoming to anyone who would want to sit under them to shelter from the sun.Licence under threat A letter seen by the Star from the county government&rsquo;s Environment department reveals that they have also requested Goldox management to manage its waste.Environment chief officer Collins Cheruiyot says the Baringo government is considering revoking the factory&rsquo;s operating licence after issuing several warnings.&ldquo;The only only option remaining is to close the industry for the sake of the health of the members of public,&rdquo; Cheruiyot said.Goldox as a foreign investor is a chief source of revenue to the county. It slaughters donkeys for export to China.Before it started operating, it promised to utilise, everything including the waste. It took the company more than a year to acquire its licence as it had to convince the relevant authorities on measures it could take to ensure that impacts on the environment are not negative. Other measures are also making sure the meat does infiltrate the markets (local butcheries).There is an abundance of donkeys in Baringo county. Silale plain in Tiaty subcounty is home to thousands of wild donkeys.The meat has been gazzeted as fit for human consumption, but most communities still view it as a taboo to consume it.Factory manager Lu Dong Lin was unavailable for comment.
