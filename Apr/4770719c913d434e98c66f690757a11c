The Kenya Red Cross Society is transferring Sh3,000 cash monthly to 3,800 families in drought-striken Wajir.The programme started on Tuesday and is to last for four months. KRCS Northeastern regional coordinator Sahal Abdi on Tuesday said the cash will be disbursed through Safaricom&rsquo;s money transfer service M-Pesa.He said although the drought is expected to lessen with the start of the long rains, the problem is still dire.&ldquo;The Kenya Red Cross is also carrying out an integrated medical outreach and supplying nutritional supplements in the three Northeastern counties &mdash; Wajir, Mandera and Garissa,&rdquo; Abdi said.Malnutrition is a serious problem. The proportion of Wajir&rsquo;s malnourished children under the age of five has increased to 20.12 per cent this month from 19 per cent last month.Abdi said the programme also purchases emaciated cattle, which are slaughtered and given as food to hungry residents.The long rains are expected to be insufficient, the drought will continue and likely worsen in some areas.
