Vihiga ANC Senate aspirant Jairus Amayi has said the party&rsquo;s Saturday nomination was fake and backward.He accused the party of giving Senator George Khaniri a direct ticket, despite having taken his own Sh20,000 membership and Sh250,000 nomination fees. Amayi said he did not expect the backyard of party leader Musalia Mudavadi to allow shambolic primaries marred by irregularities.&ldquo;It is evident I was short-changed because Senator Khaniri travelled out of the country early this week not bothered about the primaries,&rdquo; Amayi said. He criticised ANC for failing to publicise names of beneficiaries of direct nominations, as did other parties.He said voting materials arrived late and his name did not even appear on ballot papers, yet he met all eligibility requirements.&ldquo;Today, I&rsquo;ve been crucified and buried. But in three days, I&rsquo;ll come back and when that happens, you can imagine how the image of ANC will be,&rdquo; Amayi told supporters. &ldquo;I still have many options which I&rsquo;ll soon announce after getting feedback from the party headquarters.&rdquo;
