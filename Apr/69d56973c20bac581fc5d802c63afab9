That&rsquo;s why we wanted to move it to Tuesday,&rdquo; Tuju said.&ldquo;But because it&rsquo;s clashing with ODM primaries and they are using the same schools as polling centres we decided to move it to Wednesday.&rdquo; Murathe said ballot papers were printed locally using different printers in two days.It was meant to ensure the ruling party meets the IEBC timelines, he said, adding that they want the process to be trustworthy. &ldquo;We have printed more than six million ballot papers.
