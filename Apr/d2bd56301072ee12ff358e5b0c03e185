Chaos erupted at Mwamanga primary school polling station in Diani, Kwale after a senator aspirant was beaten and arrested by police.Nicholas Zani was beaten by the officer as he attempted to force his way into a polling station in Ukunda during the ODM nominations.Zani says he had gone to inquire why his agents had been blocked from overseeing the counting of the votes.He found himself at the receiving end when he refused to leave the room after being ordered by police.The politician accused police of throwing him out yet he is an aspirant hence justified to oversee vote counting."I refused to get out in fear I was going to be rigged out. The officers had also blocked my agents.""The police beat me up and threw me into a lorry just because I requested to observe my votes being counted," he said."It is a very sad day for Kwale people," he said, further asking the ODM national elections board to probe the matter.Zani, after he was released by the officers, asked the elections board to deal with the incident where votes were burned contrary to the party&rsquo;s laws."It means those involved were destroying evidence after we learned of a plot to rig the process," he said.The cast votes were reportedly burned following an agreement between agents and polling clerks.Mwamanga village chairman Salim Said said that despite the area voting peacefully, it was not fair to burn votes."Other stations like Gambato and Shamu were chaotic unlike us in Mwamanga.""We wanted votes to be counted but the presiding officer insisted they should be burned," he said."It is wrong locals woke up early to vote and at the end, the votes are burned," Salim added.The ODM polls in Kwale, Mombasa, and Kilifi were marred by claims of irregularities.Read: Aisha Jumwa beats Mtengo in Malindi ODM polls, MP rejects results[VIDEO] Chaos, delays as Jumwa, Mtengo lock horns for Malindi ODM MP ticket
