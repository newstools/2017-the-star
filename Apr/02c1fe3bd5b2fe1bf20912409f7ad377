NTSA will continue using breathalysers to arrest and charge drunk drivers despite a court order declaring this illegal.In a statement on Friday, director general Francis Meja dismissed a ruling by the Appeal court and said they would adhere to a previous one by the High Court.Meja noted the court said breathalyser rules did not introduce any new offences other than those in the Traffic Act and that there is need for the two to be realigned.But he said: "NTSA informs members of the public that driving under the influence of alcohol is an offence and that the authority will continue to execute its mandate to keep our roads safe." On June 9, 2014, High Court judge David Majanja found that the transport ministry had powers to make rules, among them measures for enforcing traffic laws.Majanja held that the rules were valid as the public was involved in their making.But Appeal court judges GBM Kariuki, Festus Azangalala and Fatuma Sichale ordered that laws introduced by the NTSA be taken back to Parliament for review.This ruling means alcoblow can be used to measure levels of alcohol consumed but that police cannot charge anyone under the rules which established alcoblow.The judges said anyone found drunk-driving should be charged under traffic laws, not alcoblow rules.More on this: Court stops use of alcoblow to charge offenders, says law contradicts Traffic Act
