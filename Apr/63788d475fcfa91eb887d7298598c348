Hassan Mwamtoa has been selected by 20 Mijikenda elders to be Nyali MP Hezron Awiti&rsquo;s running mate for the Mombasa governor seat. The selection by thorough vetting took seven months. More than 10 applicants were ruled out.Mwamtoa, a Moi University graduate and a bank investor, is expected to represent Mijikenda interests. Awiti (pictured) and Mwamtoa will sign a memorandum of understanding at Likoni in a few weeks. Mwamtoa, a Muslim, is pushing for a 50-50 power-sharing deal with Awiti that will see Mijikenda take half of the county government&rsquo;s jobs if they defeat Governor Hassan Joho on August 8. The other half will be shared out among other tribes. Mijikendas are the majority in Mombasa. In his acceptance speech on Saturday at an event held in Likoni, Mwamtoa said job creation, growing businesses, curbing the drug menace and improving education will be his priorities. Awiti was not present. The MP has dismissed polls rating him below Joho as propaganda.His defection from Wiper to the Vibrant Democratic Party shook the opposition, mostly Wiper, with pundits saying he has a slim chance of winning after quitting the party, where he was the national treasurer.VDP is not affiliated to NASA or Jubilee, and it will be launched today in Mombasa. VDP secretary general Fred Kai said the party will associate with other coalitions after the election.Awiti, the leader of VDP, is the second Mombasa governor candidate whose running mate is known. DP William Ruto said Anania Mwaboza will be Suleiman Shahbal&rsquo;s running mate on the JP. Joho, whose deputy Hazel Katana joined Jubilee to run for Mombasa senator, is yet to chose a running mate.
