Talented actress Eunice Wambui, famously known as Nyasuguta, has decided to try her luck in politics, and she is content that come the next general election, she will be among the sitting MPs at the August House. Nyasuguta, who is vying for the Embakasi South MP seat on a Jubilee ticket, says she is ready to bring change in her constituency. "I will create job employment opportunities for the youth, table banking for women and ensure CDF funds are equally distributed to the needy students."Embakasi South is said to be one of the worst-performing constituencies, with sewage outbursts everywhere and a high crime rate, but Nyasuguta has already started constructing drainage and trenches to prove to her constituents she is fit for the post. "This is to ensure that cases of cholera and typhoid reduce and will also build well-equipped hospitals, as the area has more police posts than health facilities. I will also nurture talents."The talented actress, who is aware of the gangs terrorising city residents, says she is ready to help these boys reform if she is voted in. Nyasuguta also spoke about her death threats and said they have reduced after she reported the matter to the police. Recently, Nyasuguta held a fundraiser and she says Mike Sonko was among those who attended and helped her. She calls upon Uhuru Kenyatta to support aspirants who don't have money. Nyasu also replied to DNG's remarks that aspirants should not call for fundraising"Calling upon people to help you doesn't mean you are poor. Even Waiguru, Uhuru and other bigwigs call for fundraising. Who is DNG to tell us not to ask for help?" she said.
