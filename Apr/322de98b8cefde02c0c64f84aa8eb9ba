ODM has been urged to award nomination certificates to aspirants who are loyal to the party.Nyatike MP Edick Anyanga wants ODM to prioritise loyalty when vetting aspirants.Addressing journalists in Homa Bay town on Tuesday, he said ODM should hold free, fair and credible nominations, but loyalty to the party must be prioritised.Anyanga said ODM should consider aspirants who have served the party in the past. &ldquo;ODM has been saying it is going to conduct credible nominations but the statement is incomplete because it excludes loyalty,&rdquo; he said.The legislator said the party must consider aspirants who cannot betray it after they are elected. &ldquo;Somebody cannot just come from London, contest for a seat in the nominations and be awarded a certificate,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;The party should consider those who have dedicated their time and resources in serving it.&rdquo;The legislator condemned cases of violence in the Migori governor race.The MP said violence may cause voter apathy and cost opposition chief Raila Odinga the presidency if he gets the NASA ticket.Anyanga said there is a need for dialogue among Migori governor hopefuls to address the feud between former minister Ochillo Ayacko and Governor Okoth Obado.&ldquo;This violence is disastrous for the people of Migori. Residents should get a governor without having to shed blood,&rdquo; he said.
