The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission plans to train up to 150,000 police officers on election laws and security before the August polls.The commission is mapping out hotspots in all the 47 counties to prepare for any risk of political violence. An American NGO, the National Democratic Institute, recently concluded in a report that pre- and post-election violence is a major concern for Kenyans.&ldquo;Virtually everyone with whom the delegation met expressed serious concern about the potential for violence,&rdquo; NDI said in its report released two weeks ago.Prior to and during political party primaries, the country was hit by a wave of unrest in Kisumu, Homa Bay, Kirinyaga and Kiambu. But the IEBC told the Star they are using the early warning signals as a mitigation strategy.&ldquo;We intend to intensify collaboration on the use of early warning and response mechanisms with other stakeholders as prevention and mitigation strategy on electoral violence,&rdquo; IEBC communication manager Andrew Limo told the Star.Limo said since July last year, the IEBC has held several workshops with security players, including the police, Directorate of Public Prosecution, the Judiciary and civil society.The DPP, Keriako Tobiko, has seconded 17 prosecutors to the commission to assist the IEBC in the prosecution of electoral offenders.The stakeholders have reviewed the election security materials that include election security handbook, charge sheets and the training manual on election security ahead of the August 8 General Election. &ldquo;Successful preparations and management of elections require that the commission and other stakeholders put in place strategies that identify risk factors relevant in an electoral context and offer prevention and mitigation measures,&rdquo; Limo said. IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati on Tuesday warned that they would impose sanctions on parties and aspirants and reminded them that they are bound by the Electoral Code of Conduct.
