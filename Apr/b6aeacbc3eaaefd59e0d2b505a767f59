The government yesterday acted swiftly to save the life of an 18-year-old girl from Kajiado West who is suffering from a life-threatening tongue tumour that has disfigured her face.The Office of the President directed Kajiado county commissioner Harsama Kello to hire a helicopter and trace the family of Mwosia Lenjoi and take her to Kenyatta National Hospital.The Star yesterday published her story, her distressing photo and her family&rsquo;s appeal for help.Mwosia dropped out of school two years ago after she was overwhelmed by a cancerous growth on her tongue.She has been in great pain and cannot eat solid food.Mwosia survives on milk, which she drinks with a straw.Kello contacted the Star to seek the direction to Mwosia&rsquo;s home in Oloibortoto, on the Kajiado-Narok border.But before the commissioner could take off from Nairobi&rsquo;s Wilson Airport, Mwosia was already in Kiserian on her way to St Mary&rsquo;s Hospital after suffering convulsions on Wednesday night.Her father, John Lenjoi, had called his neighbours after her daughter&rsquo;s condition worsened and they raised money to take her to hospital.Pastor John Mashal hired a vehicle for the Lenjois. Meanwhile, after learning about their departure, the Health ministry sent an ambulance to pick her from Kiserian.She was admitted to KNH yesterday and CS Cleopa Mailu visited her at 11.30am.Mwosia was taken to an observation room for tests before doctors began treatment.Early last year, she had surgery in China but the growth returned rapidly. John said, &ldquo;At least our prayers have been heard by God. We are happy that the government has agreed to help us treat our firstborn daughter. We&rsquo;ve not slept for the last two years.&rdquo;His wish was that his daughter be admitted to KNH or another quality medical facility.John said they have visited many hospitals. However, the family could not afford the high costs of treatment and medication. Mwosia&rsquo;s condition deteriorated.Family friend Joe Sirai early last year connected John to a foreign philanthropist who paid for Mwosia&rsquo;s surgery in China.She seemed well after the operation, but a month after returning, the tumour returned and growth was rapid.It was a downward spiral for a life that was promising. John&rsquo;s herd of cattle, which sustained the family, has perished in the drought. They have been depending on well-wishers.
