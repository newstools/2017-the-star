Prices of dairy products have gone up by Sh5, hurting food businesses. New Kenya Co-operative Creameries managing director Nixon Sigey says the prices of milk by-products such as butter have gone up to Sh600 from Sh560 for 500g. He attributed this to a 30 to 40 per cent decrease in the volume of milk being produced by dairy farmers due to the prolonged drought. &ldquo;When production of milk goes down, our first and main priority is to supply liquid milk to consumers before we supply by-products which are a preference for a few Kenyans as they are expensive,&rdquo; he told the Star yesterday on the phone. Prices of raw milk in the shelves have increased by Sh3 to reach Sh8 from Sh5 for the last one month. The new KCC is selling a litre at Sh43, and Brookside at Sh42.
