NTSA will take action against motorists and members of the public who assault the agency's officers at roadblocks.Director general Francis Meja told journalists on Monday that some unscrupulous motorists assaulted NTSA staff on Friday.He said those on their radar include persons who have misinterpreted the ruling barring the use of breathalysers.Meja said the lot took advantage of the Court of Appeal ruling that the use of breathalysers to charge drunk drivers is illegal.Judges GBM Kariuki, Festus Azangalala and Fatuma Sichale said the laws introduced by NTSA are inconsistent with the Traffic Act.Meja, however, dismissed reports that the authority had been stopped from using breathalysers."We shall deal with anyone who interferes with the work or our officers on the ground," he said.Read: Court stops use of alcoblow to charge offenders, says law contradicts Traffic ActThe NTSA boss said the ruling only advised that the laws were inconsistent with the traffic rules."The authority is working to rectify this. The court advised that instead of drunk drivers being charged under NTSA laws, they should be charged under the traffic laws as stipulated in the constitution," he said. "The judgement by the court does not in any way affect the validity of drink-drive operations. The authority will continue with the crackdown on drunk drivers across the country especially during the Easter holiday."Read: Alcoblow cases mergedAlso read: Government ordered to respond to alcoblow case within 21 daysMeja maintained that driving under the influence of alcohol was an offence and that the authority will not relent on the crackdown."To avoid trouble, we urge those who intoxicate themselves to use taxis," he said.
