The Independent Electoral and Boundaries&rsquo; Commission, the manager and referee of the General Election, should be commended for allowing the Opposition to operate a parallel tallying system on August 8. IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati walked NASA leader Raila Odinga through the rules of engagement in his offices at Anniversary Towers, Nairobi, on Thursday.The first condition was that the parallel tally was for internal use only.The official announcement and declaration of results remain the IEBC&rsquo;s mandate.Independent tallying of and verification of results has been a mainstay of mature democracies for decades. It is also known as exit polling.The political formation Raila will lead going into the general election has an enormous responsibility &ndash; independent tallying is not a licence to kill or otherwise cause chaos in the event that the election has not gone according to one&rsquo;s great expectations.It must never again be the case in Kenya that electoral choice is a death or injury sentence and a ballot a death warrant.
