A do-or-die race looms today for Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko and 2013 presidential candidate Peter Kenneth as JP members cast their votes to nominate who will run against Governor Evans Kidero.The nomination will brighten or destroy their political careers.President Uhuru Kenyatta had attempted to mediate so the duo would reach consensus, but it failed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll endeavour to find consensus. My office is still open to any aspirant who wants my office to facilitate meditations. It&rsquo;s an offer as a party, but if they opt for nominations, the democratic will of the people will take precedence,&rdquo; Uhuru said last week at State House, Nairobi.It appeared Sonko and Kenneth were not willing to step down for each other, leaving their future in the hands of JP electors. Kenneth&rsquo;s entry into the race for the coveted office is largely seen to have everything to do with the 2022 presidential succession politics. The former Kenya Reinsurance MD is poised to be Deputy President William Ruto&rsquo;s running-mate should the Jubilee 2013 pre-election pact stand the test of time.Kenneth, a man with a colourful career in banking and insurance industry, is seen to represent the elite, while the flamboyant senator is seen as a grassroots mobiliser with the ability to connect with the common mwananchi.In the 2011-12 financial year, during Kenneth&rsquo;s term as Gatanga MP, the constituency was rated among the top in CDF use.At the 2013 election, Sonko garnered 116,622 votes more than Kidero&rsquo;s 692,483, even though they ran for different seats.Meanwhile, another city constituency to watch is Starehe, where incumbent MP Maina Kamanda, a long-time Uhuru ally, will face stiff competition from singer Charles Njagua, popularly known as Jaguar.Lang&rsquo;ata constituency is another area to watch as several aspirants from the Kalenjin community battle it out for the ticket.For the woman rep seat, Karen Nyamu, Wangui Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a, Millicent Omanga and incumbent Rechael Shebesh square it off for the ticket.
