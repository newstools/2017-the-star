Ask anyone, other than a Donald Trump sycophant or hapless partisan Republican, and they will tell you that the 46th US President is the most ill-prepared to occupy that office. His bungling of the first major Executive Order, and, most recently, the spectacular failure of the &ldquo;repeal and replace&rdquo; Obamacare, are just but two examples that show why it&rsquo;s a bad idea to elect anyone to high office with such dearth of knowledge and hapless leadership skills.That doesn&rsquo;t mean the man is uneducated: He did obtain an undergraduate degree from the University of Pennsylvania before his father gave him money and sent him off to real the estate investment business, where he did quite well.The point here is that, as a leader, there is no correlation between education and performance or success in business for that matter. Just as you have dimwits who plough their way to high office at the expense of well-educated leaders, who can&rsquo;t match their ill-gotten wealth they use to get power. You end up having well-educated individuals trying to outdo the dimwits in their incompetence in managing the affairs of the big office.On the other hand, history is replete with examples of individuals, who had only minimal education or were otherwise poorly educated but went on to accomplish great things in life. B ut, to be sure, those are obviously exceptions than the norm, which leads to the question, why did the framers of our 2010 Constitution introduce academic requirements for holding public office?The answer was obviously an attempt to prevent rich but illiterate people from dominating elective politics as they had since Independence Unfortunately, this has led to the increase of fake academic certificates by politicians, using them to gain office, without necessarily changing the overall quality of leadership.Jubilee is now attempting to use the education requirement, in a classic holier-than-thou caes unlike anything we have ever seen before, to try and undermine Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho. It is using every state machine simply because the man dared to challenge President Uhuru Kenyatta, and his failure to provide leadership not just for the Coast people, but everywhere else across the country.One of the fronts Jubilee is attacking Joho on is using the Directorate of Criminal Investigations, an agency previously mostly known for investigating though not resolving serious crimes, to validate the bogus claim that Joho presented fake documents for admission to university and to get other certificates of higher learning.The governor confirmed to this writer and others that his academic credentials are not fake and dismissed the fake documents talk about him tas a desperate move by Jubilee to cripple him politically. What they don&rsquo;t know is that in doing so, his popularity in Coast soars and now, thanks to this onslaught, suddenly the making of a force to reckon with not just in Coast, but across the country.Put in another way, Jubilee is going to these extremes to counter Joho&rsquo;s growing influence and his standing up against the President, not because it&rsquo;s a wise strategy, but because they&rsquo;re not used to dealing with a fearless person who doesn&rsquo;t crumble at the unleashing of state machine against him, or one who&rsquo;s ironclad against all forms of bribery directed at him to abandon his vision and people-centered politics.Joho is not alone in this for we have had a number of fearless leaders in this country, who have challenged and in the end won against the powers that be, starting from the man Joho calls his mentor, Opposition chief Raila Odinga.&ldquo;I am ready to be punished politically,&rdquo; declared Joho in the face of all this intimidation.That&rsquo;s the making of a force to reckon with and none other than Jubilee takes a lion&rsquo;s share of this good news that seals the fate of Jubilee in Coast and, indeed, the rest of the country. Other leaders will certainly be inspired and do what the Mombasa governor has done, and that&rsquo;s telling Jubilee, your days are numbered!Omwenga is a legal expert and political commentator in the United States
