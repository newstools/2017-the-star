ODM treasurer Timothy Bosire (pictured) yesterday warned Education CS Fred Matiang&rsquo;i against disrespecting elected leaders from Gusiiland.The Kitutu Masaba MP accused Matiang&rsquo;i of having &ldquo;bad manners&rdquo; in his forays to campaign for Jubilee.&ldquo;He&rsquo;s trying to engage in politics. This is not in order. It&rsquo;s against the Public Service Code of Conduct,&rdquo; Bosire said.The Leadership and Integrity Act prohibits civil servants from campaigning.Bosire was reacting to an incident at the weekend in which Matiang&rsquo;i accused Kisii Governor James Ongwae of following him to public meetings. Matiang&rsquo;i told Ongwae to have his own political events.But Bosire termed the behaviour unacceptable. &ldquo;The governor has a duty to participate in public activities in his county, invited or otherwise,&rdquo; he said.The MP accused Matiang&rsquo;i of attempting to &ldquo;bully and arm-twist elected leaders from the region&rdquo; into joining Jubilee.&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no reason to be uncomfortable in the presence of the governor if there is no mischief to be committed,&rdquo; Bosire said.The legislator told Matiang&rsquo;i to publicly apologise to Ongwae for the embarrassment he caused him at the Masimba Catholic Church.&ldquo;A well educated person like him should not allow himself to be misused by Jubilee. We urge him to stop or he will face resistance,&rdquo; Bosire said.CSs have been publicly campaigning for Jubilee. But State House denies this, adding that they &ldquo;attend rallies to provide accountability&rdquo;
