Illiterate Pokot residents of Tiaty sub-county in Baringo have decided to vote for politicians with easy-to memorise names at the Jubilee primaries on Friday. Former Kositei councillor Yudah Losutan told the Star politicians did not campaign in the area due to violence but that the "patriotic" people will vote anyway.Losutan said on Thursday that they have grasped the names of some of the aspirants.&ldquo;Majority of our people are illiterate. They cannot read or write and so they have mastered the trick of memorising the surnames and nicknames of the aspirants,&rdquo; he said&ldquo;Our people are ready to elect their MCA, woman representative, senator and governor based on their memorable names."Losutan said 70 per cent of the population in East Pokot cannot read and write, not even their own names, and that lucky are candidates whose names are first in the residents' minds.The ex-councillor said Pokots have been using this approach since independence in 1963 and that it will be the case during the general election on August 8.He gave examples of &lsquo;Cheboi&rsquo; and &lsquo;Kiptis whose names he said were easy to remember in 2013, saying the people simply refer to them by their last names. Benjamin Cheboi is Baringo county chief while Stanley Kiptis is a former Kenya National Union of Teachers official.Losutan also named Simon Chelugui and Christine Ndoigo who are in the senator race, incumbent woman representative Grace Kiptui and her opponent Susan Chesyna, who is former Kenya Power director.He also mentioned Baringo Senator Gideon Moi, Tiaty MP Asman Kamama and parliamentary aspirants Simon Kiuta and William Kamket, and several others eying MCA posts.The former councillor said matters have been worsened by the lack of campaigns amid security operations by government security agencies.Kenya Defence Forces, GSU and Kenya Police Reservists are confiscating illegally acquired weapons and flushing out bandits who have left several people killed or injured and destroyed property.Tiaty MP aspirant Pepee Kitambaa and Loyamorok MCA Frederick Cheretei are some of the victims of the violence.More on this: Cheretei, Kitambaa were assassinated for political reasons, says RailaAlso read: KNCHR asks Kamama to step aside over links to Baringo clashesLosutan said the sub-county has 31,700 voters spread across 21 locations in seven wards."We are only hearing of posters mounted in major towns like Marigat, Kabarnet and Eldama-Ravine towns. We don't have them here," he said.
