The National Environmental Management Authority should be supported for its move to enforce the clearance of electioneering posters, after the August 8 election, put up by candidates.Nema officials yesterday announced the deposit bond will be refundable, but only if the aspirants clear their posters and the Authority ascertains the cleanup (see report P7).The deposit bond will be deposited in the Nema Environment Restoration Fund account with the assistance of the county governments.Nema, the IEBC and the Council of Governors need to meet and give directions, including agreeing on the bond amount.Every available outdoors space is taken up by the most garish electioneering materials during general election campaign periods. Things become worse when predatory rivals paste their own materials on top on of other candidates&rsquo;.In worst-case scenarios &ndash; and they proliferate &ndash; even road signs and shop fronts are covered up. And then there is the use of indelible spray can messaging, which covers walls, windows and highways.Candidates and their handlers should be encouraged to behave environmentally responsibly for once.
