ODM nominee for Gem Constituency Elisha Odhiambo has exuded confidence that he will fly the party flag in the forthcoming August General Election.Odhiambo trounced the incumbent, who doubles as the National Assembly deputy minority leader Jakoyo Midiwo, in the primaries held last week.He garnered 13,400 votes against Midiwo's 8,900 votes.&ldquo;There has been a lot of anxiety raised by Jakoyo claiming that he has the certificate but I would like to assure my supporters that the party has assured me that the person who won will be given the certificate,&rdquo; he said.Odhiambo said that he had been legally declared the winner of the exercise by the returning officer and he had no cause for worry.&ldquo;The only person mandated to read the results is the returning officer and he was there. This election was not about Jakoyo but about the people of Gem,&rdquo; he said in a press conference at Serena Hotel in Nairobi on Saturday.Odhiambo termed his victory the voice of Gem people who have for a long time expressed confidence in his leadership because of his development record in the area and had earlier given him the nod in 2013 though he was not given the certificate by ODM.&ldquo;I want to confirm that I won the nominations in 2013 and even though I was not given the certificate I stayed with the party. I want to confirm that even if elections were held today, I would still beat him (Midiwo) as it is the people who always elect me,&rdquo; he said.He alleged that Midiwo, on sensing defeat, burnt voting materials and tried to interfere with voting in several places in the constituency to save himself from defeat.&ldquo;He burnt voting materials in Ober primary school when he realized that I have gotten more votes in his own village. He stopped elections in various places like Malele and other areas,&rdquo; he said.He accused Midiwo of using police officers to intimidate him and cause mayhem in the area to disrupt him and scare away his supporters, alleging that he might be working in cahoots with people in government.&ldquo;We are operating like we are in a jungle. On the eve of the primaries my car was shot at. Jakoyo had three lorries of GSU officers.&ldquo;The day of the nomination, I was shot at and reported to the police in Yala and no action was taken. I am asking, is Jakoyo acting as the president of Kenya or is he having people in the government who help him cause mayhem,&rdquo; said Odhiambo.He said that he would focus on improving food security in the area and also on education for all.
