We have a calendar of about 12 months for about two surgeries,&rdquo; Kambuni said.&ldquo;The bowel is not at the perineum and now that the wounds have healed we can put the bowl on where it should be. Their skins would also need to be reconstructed,&rdquo; he added.The twins&rsquo; mother Caroline Mukiri want the public to help her raise her babies owing to the fact that she is not employed and also comes from a poor family background.&ldquo;As I go back to home with my children I am asking for help from Kenyans who can assist me in any way they can.
