When a man discovered that his girlfriend was cheating on him with another man, instead of simply walking away, he wanted his revenge.In a pair of videos, the wronged boyfriend is seen having enlisted the help of his girlfriend's other man in a fake proposal that would leave the cheating woman red-faced.The prank began with the first man seemingly surprising his girlfriend at her work, which appears to be at a large sports bar and restaurant.The prank almost goes horribly wrong as it becomes clear that he may have jumped the gun and his surprise guest hasn't arrived yet.Stalling for time, he holds out the ring box and begins talking to the woman, who is obviously ready to say yes to his proposal.Finally, the door opens and in walks her other man. He approaches the pair of them and she initially doesn't seem to react, still apparently excited about the proposal she believed was coming.But then the other man reveals the game, he shouts at her: 'You had two good men! Two good f***ing men! You f***ed it up!'Another man off screen tells him to 'relax, man' as he is ready to unleash more of his anger. Livid, the woman backs away, turns and then runs out the door while the first man shouts after her: 'You see how you played me?'After she disappeared, the men reveal that she had been secretly seeing both of them for months and that one of them claimed to have even bought her a car.
