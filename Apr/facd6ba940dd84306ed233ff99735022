George Maara garnered 8,403 votes.The mechanics urged Kiragu&rsquo;s supporters to accept the results. &ldquo;Who knows what they are cooking. They should accept the results.

We asked ourselves why they didn&rsquo;t raise the concern on Tuesday or Wednesday. Why wait until Friday?&rdquo; he said.Kiragu said he has filed a complaint at the JP headquarters demanding the exercise be repeated.Publican John Karing&rsquo;u urged JP not to hand the nomination certificate to Mwathi before investigations are conducted.
