Tana River aspirants and voters have been urged to maintain peace before, during and after the August election to avoid ethnic violence. Governor Hussein Dado (pictured) said in the county the county has  experienced bloody interclan clashes in the Tana Delta and Bura. He spoke in Bura on Wednesday during a meeting with Jubilee aspirants, including area MP Ali Wario, woman representative Halima Ware and Galole MP Hassan Sukicha. Dado said peace is worked for, not earned. “Our county is unique in the sense that it is made up of multi-ethnic communities. There are both Christians and Muslims. This should be a unifying factor, not one to divide us,” he said. Dado called for peaceful campaigns. The governor, who is the chairman of the Council of Governors security committee, said he will work with elders and leaders of all communities in Tana River to ensure peace.
