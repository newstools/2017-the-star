A public inquest to determine what caused the death of a 10-year-old pupil will begin on June 21 in a Nanyuki court.Joy Waguthi of Mukandamia Primary School died on January 29 this year, after she was reportedly beaten by her teacher for failing a reading test.Venezia Njuguna, the deputy head teacher, had been charged with murder.But the court acquitted him after a post-mortem report indicated the standard three pupil died from congested vessels of the intestinal walls.When the autopsy report was presented before the court, the prosecution told senior resident magistrate Evans Ngigi that it did not have enough evidence to charge the teacher with murder.Ngigi set Njuguna free, and directed police to apply for a public inquest through the chief magistrate&rsquo;s court.Yesterday, Laikipia Central police boss Ben Changulo said medics who treated Waguthi, chief government pathologist Dr Johansen Oduor, the deceased guardian and standard three pupils who witnessed the teacher beat the deceased will testify on June 21. Njuguna is also in the line-up.
