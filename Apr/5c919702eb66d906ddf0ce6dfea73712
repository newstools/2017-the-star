Elisha Odhiambo, the winner of the ODM primaries for the Gem parliamentary seat, has exuded confidence he will fly the party flag in the August 8 polls.Odhiambo trounced incumbent and National Assembly deputy minority leader Jakoyo Midiwo in the primaries. He garnered 13,400 votes against Midiwo&rsquo;s 8,900 votes. &ldquo;There has been a lot bit of anxiety raised by Jakoyo claiming he has the certificate, but I would like to tell my supporters the party has assured me the person who won will be given the certificate,&rdquo; Odhiambo said. He said he was legally declared the winner by the returning officer and is not worried. &ldquo;The only person mandated to read the results is the returning officer and he was there. This election was not about Jakoyo, but about the people of Gem,&rdquo; he said at a press conference in Nairobi on Saturday. Midiwo had said the nominations were not fair.
