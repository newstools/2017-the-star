President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s visit to Narok on Friday was a resounding success, Governor Samuel Tunai has said.He said those downplaying the visit are misleading the people.Tunai was speaking during Narok South MP Korei ole Lemein&rsquo;s reelection campaign launch at Oloshapani on Monday.Some leaders, led by North MP Moitalel ole Kenta, said the visit was just a public relations exercise.They said the Maasai community has nothing to show in terms of development.During his visit, Uhuru, accompanied by DP William Ruto, presented medical equipment to Kilgoris hospital and Narok County Referral Hospital. He opened the Kilgoris public market, laid the foundation stone for a level 4 hospital, commissioned the Narok water plant and Narok-Sekenani road.Tunai said nobody can deny the existence of the projects or cast aspersions on the President&rsquo;s support for the Maasai.He said Narok leaders have pleaded with successive governments for 50 years to build the Narok-Sekenani road.&ldquo;Is the Sekenani road real or not? The ultramodern medical equipment at the county hospital and the water treatment plant are real and this was done by the Uhuru government,&rdquo; Tunai said.
