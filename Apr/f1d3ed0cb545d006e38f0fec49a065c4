Widespread protests in Homa Bay Town yesterday following the announcement of Governor Cyprian Awiti as the winner in the ODM primaries should not be taken lightly.Business came to a standstill in the town as the protestors demanded the nullification of the entire process (See P37).The supporters of Awiti rival Oyugi Magwanga threatened to &ldquo;teach ODM a lesson&rdquo; at the General Election on August 8 if the party insists on giving Awiti the ticket.The results showed that he garnered 46,346 votes against Magwanga&rsquo;s 14,661.In the Senate race the incumbent Moses Kajwang&rsquo; got 1,948 votes against his closest challenger Fred Rabongo&rsquo;s 754 votes.The big margin between the votes for governor and senator caused all the consternation and rebellion.This gap is illogical and does not add up. What&rsquo;s more it smacks of ballot stuffing.ODM would do well to cancel and repeat the Homa Bay governor primaries. After all, following the extension by court order of the primaries timelines, they have the extra time to do so.
