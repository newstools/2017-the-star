Attorney General Githu Muigai yesterday launched the National Legal Aid Service Board to offer free services to poor and vulnerable litigants.He said the free legal scheme will start offering the services to children, women and people living with disability.&ldquo;The issue of legal aid to persons, who otherwise could not afford legal services has been a subject of numerous proposals for the last 36 years. We have been grappling with the problem of how we can finance legal services for the litigants,&rdquo; Muigai said.The AG said the aim is to bridge the legal gap between the rich and the poor. &ldquo;You can imagine a teenage mother who drops out of school and is unable to access the court to obtain maintenance for an infant,&rdquo; he said.
