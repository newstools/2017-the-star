Parents in rural areas have been urged to support their children&rsquo;s education so they are productive and do not become a problem to society, a legislator has said.Lari MP Mburu Kahangara yesterday said education is a valuable asset that children inherit from their parents.&ldquo;You can imagine what our children would become if they didn&rsquo;t get good education and we don&rsquo;t have a land to give them. They want their space in life, they want to do things without telling you. What will prevent them from stealing and doing anything else possible to get money to eat?&rdquo; he said.The lawmaker urged parents support their children's dreams and pray for them to come true.&ldquo;When I was seeking for your votes, I talked about education. I started sponsoring bright and needy students. I didn&rsquo;t stop after I was elected,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;So far I have 25 students I sponsor because I want to see them building the country even if they come from poor families and I guess that is a good dream I have and I won&rsquo;t stop.&rdquo;The MP spoke on Monday at Matathia Primary School in Kijabe ward. The school was refurbished using CDF.He urged parents to motivate their children, support teachers and school management to create a good relationship and improve school activities.Kahangara said he has supported the government&rsquo;s strategy of ensuring pupils score high marks in their final national examinations.The MP urged parents to guard their children&rsquo;s behaviour and conduct so they can learn with ease and without creating trouble and misconduct.
