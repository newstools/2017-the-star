The Galana-Kulalu irrigation project is to start distributing maize flour at the Coast for Sh75 for a two-kilogramme packet.Irrigation CS Eugene Wamalwa yesterday said the flour, branded Unga Galana, has been produced, milled and packaged in Galana.The price of a two-kilogamme packet of maize flour is currently about Sh142 in supermarkets. The government on Tuesday announced the cost would come down to Sh115 in a week.This follows interventions to zero-rate duty on maize imports from Ethiopia and Mexico and off-loading of one million bags of maize from the National Strategic Food Reserve to millers at Sh3,000 a bag.&ldquo;The National Irrigation Board can now put a packet of unga on the shelves at Sh75 from the 10,000-acre model farm in Galana-Kulalu irrigation,&rdquo; Wamalwa said.The model farm was initially supposed to be complete in March and handed over to the private sector. However, it has delayed and the CS said it will now be complete in the next six months.According to NIB chief engineer Mwangi Thuita, out of the 125,000 50kg bags of maize that have been harvested, 60,000 bags were sold to the Department of Special Programmes in the Devolution ministry.This was meant for distribution to starving residents of drought-stricken areas. Another 30,000 bags were sold to the Strategic Food Reserve, while 5,000 bags was sold to Kilifi county for Sh1,667 each.&ldquo;The remaining maize is what has been milled and is ready to be sold to Coastal people. We have 5,000kg of maize flour ready for distribution,&rdquo; Thuita said.He explained that to get to this cost, they factored in the fuel, labour, packets, packaging material and production of 90kg bags of maize in Galana, which is Sh2,400, while that of an ordinary farmer in Rift valley is at Sh2,750.&ldquo;Based on this cost of production, we have seen it is possible to feed Kenyans with a two-kg packet of maize flour at Sh75,&rdquo; Thuita said. Agriculture CS Willy Bett last Friday said the effects of zero-rating maize flour will start being felt after one week when maize imports from Mexico arrive. He said the average cost of a 90-kilogramme bag of maize is currently at Sh4,500 and there is fear that it could rise to Sh5,000.&ldquo;If this continues, the prices of maize flour will be pushed to a high of Sh160 for a two-kg packet. The waiver of duty on imports by the government will curb this. Maize from Mexico is the cheapest in the market and it should help reduce the price of maize flour.&rdquo;
