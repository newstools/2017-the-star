President Uhuru Kenyatta yesterday said ODM is issuing direct nomination certificates to politicians with money.The President said ODM is more focused on its own coffers than Kenyans&rsquo; welfare.The Jubilee Party will not hand out direct tickets and primaries will be open and fair, Uhuru said in Ruaka, Kiambu county, during a meet-the-people tour.&ldquo;Our colleagues, as we speak, are giving out certificates. They are seated in offices and deciding this place is for this candidate, and that place for that candidate. It means they have no agenda for the ordinary person,&rdquo; Uhuru said.&ldquo;It is not that they are giving them for free, there is a crocodile there, whose work is to collect money,&rdquo; he said.Those given direct nomination tickets on Monday included include governors Hassan Joho (Mombasa), Wycliffe Oparanya (Kakamega), Josephat Nanok (Turkana), Amason Kingi (Kilifi), Evans Kidero (Nairobi), Joseph Nkedianye (Kajiado) and James Ongwae (Kisii).The President said there will be no direct nominations for the Jubilee aspirants.Uhuru said Jubilee is a party that upholds democracy and will ensure the choice of the people carries day on April 21 during the primaries.&ldquo;The nomination exercise will be free and fair. No one will be accorded a direct ticket, because the people will decide those to run on the party&rsquo;s ticket in August,&rdquo; he said. The President said the opposition has sent a clear signal that it will not accept defeat in August.&ldquo;In 2002, I contested and lost to retired President Mwai Kibaki. I never spent even a day without conceding defeat for the sake of the country, yet there is someone who has told the youths that this year they should riot since the elections will be rigged as he only thinks of himself only and not the people,&rdquo; Uhuru said.On Sunday in Kibera, ODM leader Raila Odinga urged the youth to come out in large numbers during the election to protect their votes from being stolen by the Jubilee wing.Yesterday, Uhuru said Raila aims for a shared government after the next election, which the President said cannot happen.The President was accompanied by Deputy President William Ruto, Kiambu Governor William Kabogo, area MPs and dozens of aspirants.
