Upcoming gospel singer Aime Mbumba has accused video producer Pastor Omba of refusing to pay him his dues.Aime, a song writer of Congolese origin, the estranged husband of gospel star Gloria Muliro, says Omba has gone quiet on him after he sold him three songs: Mapenzi Yako Yamenogea, which was officially released by former TPF singer Ruth Matete, Mapenzi Yako Yatimie Kwangu by Shaniz, a Coast-based upcoming gospel artiste, Sijui Nitaenda Wapi Sina Mwengine by Sly, the controversial pastor's alleged lover, and Nakutamani Yahweh by Omba, which the singer claims he took without asking for his permission.Aime claims he has been trying to reach Omba to pay him but whenever he asks about his pay, he takes him round in circles, claiming he has not received any money from MCSK and that the three women, Ruth Matete and the rest, are the ones to pay him."When I try calling Ruth, at times she ignores my calls and at times she picks and tells me to talk to Omba not her."The artiste, who recently released a new song called Shamba Boy, says he is tired of all this hide-and-seek games and "all I want is my money. Please Omba meet up with the three musicians who are signed under Spotlight media and plan on how to pay me my Sh3 million. I'm tired of madharau. That's my sweat and I hope you will do something very soon."Aime, who parted ways with Omba's record, further says that he quit working with him due to poor pay."He always demanded a 50 per cent share from what I made and that triggered me to leave."He also said he took Omba to the copyright court. "Omba was asked to pay him but he says he will only give me Sh100,000 for four songs," he said."Omba is playing with my work and I won't allow this. Upcoming artistes suffer in the hands of producers who sell out their audios before they even record the videos due to lack of cash. By exposing him, I'm sure this will help the underdogs to speak up and it will be a lesson to those cunning producers out there.We called pastor Omba for a comment and he said:"I don't have a contract with Aime Mbumba and that's why I can't talk anything concerning him. I was just helping him."
