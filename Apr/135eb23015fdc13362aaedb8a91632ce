Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka has dismissed claims that ODM's Raila Odinga has been named the coalition's presidential candidate.This followed reports that the NASA coordinating committee has proposed the Wiper leader to be Raila's running mate.There is also a claim that Musalia Mudavadi of ANC is tipped for the role of the chief minister.Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang'ula, according to sources privy to the details, will be named Speaker of the National Assembly."The committee has nothing to do with naming the NASA flag bearer.""Their work is to come up with the guiding principles and leave the rest to the principals," Kalonzo said.Kalonzo reiterated that if the choice will be made in a manner that demeans his principles, he will tell off his colleagues.The Wiper leader said he will not bolt out of the coalition but rather fight from within for the best interests of the country."It is true we have reasonable heat in the coalition but we are ready to battle and unseat the Jubilee regime," he said.Kalonzo dismissed allegations that he was clinging to the 2013 MoU to blackmail the other principals."What we had in 2013 was a secret document between Raila, Wetangula and I." "Now that Mudavadi has been brought on board, that is all gone. We have signed a NASA agreement. We are ready to move on," Kalonzo said.Read: It's Raila-Kalonzo!

I have a family and friends who look to me as a role model.""How would I go down to receive money from Jubilee?" he asked.In regards to the naming of a NASA presidential flag bearer, Kalonzo said this has been delayed deliberately to cool political heat.He said the four principles will go for a retreat to finalise on a combination that will take on the incumbent during the August 8 polls."I want to assure all our supporters that before the end of April, we shall have named our flag bearer," he said.Kalonzo said they will implement the TJRC report if they win the polls.He said Cord did not lose in the 2013 election, adding that it is him who convinced Raila to wait for Supreme Court ruling."It was never quoted as a proper judgment. We only lost digitally but we are confident the court denied us victory," he said.
