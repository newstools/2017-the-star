Machakos Senator Johnson Muthama yesterday denied he might run for Nairobi senator."I have paid my nomination to Wiper party as a candidate for Machakos county," he told the Star on the phone.Last week, during a Wiper NEC open discussion, Muthama said, "I'm even contemplating to move to a different county, maybe Nairobi."On Monday, Muthama also gave rise to speculation that he might run for Nairobi senator, replacing Mike Sonko who wants to run for governor.Speaking on a vernacular radio station, Muthama said venturing into the capital city's politics is one of his options.&ldquo;If I believe I have the muscle to go for Nairobi Senate and win, what is wrong with that? Will that not open a chance for another Kamba to replace me in Machakos and grow the community&rsquo;s representation nationally?&rdquo; he asked.However, yesterday he said his comments had been misinterpreted."If I declare my candidature for Kiambu senator, will I be rejected because I'm a Kamba or I cannot deliver services? It's time we start taking such risks to show Kenyans we can be bred and lead in any part of the country," he said. "I'm a national politician, I can move to Nairobi, Migori, Homa Bay, Nakuru, Mombasa or Kiambu, because I fear nothing and believe in myself and that I can be elected anywhere." He said such a move would help "kill tribalism".On Monday, Muthama said his political career has grown beyond regional to national level. He said he is at liberty to run for any seat anywhere in the country and win.&ldquo;Mimi sio jogoo wa kuwika shambani peke yake, nataka kuwika pia mjini (I'm not a cock that only crows in the village, I also want to crow in the city). That is what we call being a real man,&rdquo; Muthama said.The senator accused the media of trying to put a wedge between him and Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka.He said reports he prefers ODM leader Raila Odinga to Kalonzo for the NASA presidential ticket is a creation of the media.&ldquo;I have a very long political history with Kalonzo and he knows the battles I have fought for him. If what has been going round is true, by now Kalonzo would have already expelled me from the negotiating committee,&rdquo; Muthama said.He said in 2002 he unsuccessfully tried to convince former President Daniel Moi to endorse Kalonzo for President.Muthama said after the 2007 general election, he participated in the signing of the PNU deal that saw Kalonzo named the VP.He said in 2013 he brokered the Raila-Kalonzo pact after noticing former President Mwai Kibaki was not ready to support the Wiper leader.Muthama said he is still fighting for Kalonzo even in the ongoing NASA negotiations and the truth will come out soon.
