Many youths in Kolanya, Teso North, aged 30 years and above are "married" to alcohol, do not have spouses or children and are leading to a reduction in population growth by eight per cent annually, a chief has said.Kolanya chief Rodgers Opuru said he has tried to make the youth abandon drinking and get spouses, but they have not stopped drinking.He spoke on Wednesday in Ang'aro village, Teso North, during the burial of Esau Otebangor Jomba, who committed suicide."The research I have instituted has revealed this sad state of affairs. Most of the youth have refused to marry and instead befriended elderly mothers.I have summoned their parents to my office to chart the way forward on the future of their children, but they too wonder why they have refused to marry with the clock ticking very fast," Opuru said.He said the current population of his location is 5,000. If the unmarried youths got married and had children, we would have had 400 more people to bring to the total population to 5,400.The chief also warned the youths against being used by politicians to fuel animosity during campaigns. He urged residents of Angurai East ward to maintain peace.
