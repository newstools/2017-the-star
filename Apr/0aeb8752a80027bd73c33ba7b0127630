Nyamira Governor John Nyagarama has maintained that ODM should use the register of members in today&rsquo;s primaries.The governor said he will only participate in free, fair and peaceful nominations.&ldquo;We shall respect the outcome of such nomination carried out procedurally and in line with the provisions of Section 28 of the Elections Act 2012 and Section 18.1 of the ODM Election and Nomination Rules. It states that voters during the party primaries should be registered party members,&rdquo; he said in Nyamira town on Sunday. He was with West Mugirango MP aspirant Peter Omboga.Nyagarama, who will face West Mugirango MP James Gesami and John Kumenda, said it would be detrimental to the party and its supporters to use the 2013 IEBC register in the primaries.&ldquo;We cannot have rules bent to suit a few of us, particularly those who never took the pain of popularising the party by way of registration of members,&rdquo; he said.
