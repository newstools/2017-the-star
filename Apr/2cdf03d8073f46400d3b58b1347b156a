Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale has been accused of failing the agriculture sector, the region&rsquo;s backbone of the economy, and engaging in political sideshows at the expense of development. Speaking to journalists in Mumias town on Wednesday, Butere MP Andrew Toboso said senators are lawmakers and should come up with laws that empower residents and provide them with extra resources.&ldquo;But Khalwale failed to protect the interests of the county government of Kakamega. This contributed to the collapse of Mumias Sugar Company,&rdquo; he said. Taboso said Khalwale (pictured) should focus on sugarcane and maize farming among other agricultural activities. He said agriculture is a devolved function and asked why the national government owns shares in Mumias Sugar.&ldquo;Why should we have people from areas where sugarcane is not grown, people who don&rsquo;t understand how cane is grown and the problems affecting cane farming heading the board of management at Mumias? Never mind that they are Kenyans. Which Luhya heads tea, coffee, miraa or pyrethrum boards in the country?&rdquo; he sasked.
