Health experts have expressed concern over rising numbers of mental health cases, especially those that go undetected.They say those suffering from chronic illnesses such as cancer, diabetes, heart diseases, HIV and noncommunicable diseases are susceptible to depression. &ldquo;People who are living with chronic physical health conditions experience conditions at twice the rate of the general population. Coexisting mental and physical conditions can diminish the quality of life and lead to longer illness duration and worse health outcomes,&rdquo; head of Quality and Standards at the Ministry of Health Pacifica Onyancha said on Friday at the Panafric Hotel.Psychiatrist and head of Mental Health Advocacy at the Health ministry Chitayi Murabula added, &ldquo;Some eight per cent of people with cancer and HIV, 15 per cent of people with heart conditions, 12 per cent of diabetics, 24 per cent among stroke patients and 17 per cent of those who have arthritis are depressed.&rdquo; He called for increased public awareness, funding and research.WHO ranked Kenya as the sixth country among those with the highest number of depression cases in Africa. About 1.9 million depression cases were reported last year. Depression and anxiety have been noted as some of the leading mental illnesses among Kenyans. Data from the MoH shows that 10.8 per cent of women suffer from depressive disorders, compared to 3.8 per cent of men. WHO estimates show that Kenya&rsquo;s depression and anxiety prevalence stand at 4.4 per cent and 3.1 per cent respectively. Depression is characterised by, among others, persistent sadness and loss of interest in activities that one normally enjoys for at least two weeks.
