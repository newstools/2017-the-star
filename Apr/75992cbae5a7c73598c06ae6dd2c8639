Parliament has asked a court to dismiss a petition opposing investigations into bribery allegations against NLC chair Muhamad Swazuri.Swazuri filed the petition to prevent the National Assembly from looking into claims that he took a Sh1.2 million bribe.Former journalist Mugo Njeru filed a petition claiming Swazuri received the amount to process compensation for Standard Gauge Railway land.Njeru wants the MPs to hold Swazuri liable for decisions made in his capacity as the NLC chairman.More on this Petitioner wants Swazuri removed from office over fraudIn response to the petition, the assembly said oversight is one of its fundamental functions in line with article 95 of the constitution.It further said on Tuesday that the sovereignty of the people of Kenya is exercised by their elected representatives. This, according to article 1 of the constitution, includes the National Assembly.&ldquo;Initiating the process of removal of state officers is therefore exercising the sovereign will of the people to remove from office state officers who have misconducted themselves," the response states.The assembly also said that under article 251 of the constitution, the inquiry is an exercise that will investigate and determine the validity of petitions for the removal of state officers.&ldquo;It also argues that the orders which Swazuri is seeking, if granted, would be a breach of the constitution which provides for Parliament to establish its committees and make standing orders for the orderly conduct of its proceedings, the response states.Parliament added that the role of the committee on the inquiry is to gather evidence and determine if there are grounds for removal.It noted that MPs will not sit as a court or a tribunal.It was also said that the orders Swazuri sought in his petition violated the principle of separation of powers as they require the court to interfere with the role of the National Assembly and the internal management of Parliament and its committees. &ldquo;The role of Parliament at this point is to interrogate the petition for the removal of Swazuri and determine whether the House is satisfied that the grounds for removal under Article 251(1) of the constitution have been met or whether the petition for removal is frivolous," it was noted in the response.The assembly asked the court to allow Parliament to complete its processes and restrain itself from restricting MPs from carrying out their constitutional obligations.On March 29, Swazuri got temporary conservatory orders stopping the parliamentary committee from probing him but the committee grilled him last week.Swazuri&rsquo;s lawyer Tom Ojienda was given time by the court to amend their petition to add a clause that will seek the quashing of all proceedings from the Lands committee that interrogated him.More on this: Swazuri seeks to stop removal from NLC over bribery allegationsAlso read: Lands Committee to continue probing Swazuri, says its has not been served
