Kitui Governor Julius Malombe has written to police to clear his name after Senator David Musila on Thursday recorded a statement, accusing him of being behind the T-shirts branded &ldquo;No Musila, No Nominations.&rdquo;The two face off today in Wiper primaries for the governor&rsquo;s seat. Malombe sent a letter to the county police commander, saying the accusation by Musila is &ldquo;a wicked plot to have me disqualified from contesting&rdquo;.The letter dated April 21 says Musila has resorted to falsehood sand diversionary tactics to redeem his dwindling political fortunes. The county boss accused Musila of scheming to sabotage the nominations.&ldquo;Apparently, in a bid to disguise his motives and to mislead security agencies, Senator Musila has reportedly filed police statements, accusing me without credible evidence that I&rsquo;m behind the printing of the T-shirts,&rdquo; the letter, copied to the county commissioner and the director general of CAK, Nairobi, reads.Musila said the message insinuated there would be violence in today&rsquo;s primaries. Instead, he criticised Malombe for planning to cause chaos.But Malombe said, &ldquo;Senator Musila should be advised to cease his not-so-clever, outdated and diversionary tactics aimed at getting me blamed for underhand acts cooked up and manufactured by his own political camp.&rdquo;He said the allegation is &ldquo;false, unfounded, malicious and alarmist&rdquo; and meant to stir up negative political emotions among peace-loving residents.
