A parliamentary committee probing bribery claims against National Land Commission chairman Muhammad Swazuri has said it will continue its probe. The committee chaired by Tharaka MP Alex Muiru said it is yet to be served with the court order obtained by Swazuri last Wednesday. Swazuri&rsquo;s lawyer Tom Ojienda moved to court to temporarily stop the panel from hearing a petition filed by former journalist Mugo Njeru. Njeru&rsquo;s petition claims Swazuri received Sh1.2 million to process compensation for standard gauge railway land. He wants the MPs to hold Swazuri liable for decisions made in his capacity as the NLC chairman. Muiru yesterday allowed NLC chief executive officer Aziz Chavangi to give his evidence before the committee as a witness because Parliament. &ldquo;Until I receive an order, I will endeavour to continue with what the committee was expected to do,&rdquo; he said.
