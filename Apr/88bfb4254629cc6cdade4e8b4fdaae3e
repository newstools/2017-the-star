More than 5,000 aspirants will take part in the ODM primaries which kick off this Friday. ODM chairman John Mbadi said the party will conduct the nominations and give tickets to successful candidates who meet the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission timelines ahead of the August polls.The party will hold primaries and give direct nominations in 41 counties.The aspirants are battling for the ODM ticket to run for governor, senator, woman rep and MCA seats in August.ODM has been reluctant to divulge the number of candidates who will take part in the nominations, as the party struggles to meet the IEBC timelines.Speaking on the phone yesterday, the Suba MP said the process will be peaceful, free and fair.&ldquo;Every aspirant signed the code of conduct and they will remain calm, peaceful and organised,&rdquo; Mbadi said.He said ODM followers will weed out people planted in the party, believed to be Jubilee sympathisers.&ldquo;The people themselves know those who are working with us or those acting as moles,&rdquo; Mbadi said.He said in some areas the aspirants will settle on one candidate through a consensus, while the unopposed will get direct tickets. &ldquo;We will have five bodies in charge of the elections working together from the national to the ward level,&rdquo; Mbadi said.The agencies will include the National Election Board, County Elections Committee, the constituency election panel and ward committee.ODM has recruited poll clerks who will be posted a day before the primaries.&ldquo;We know JP has planned to destabilise some parts during the primaries, but we will not allow them,&rdquo; Mbadi said. The teams will announce the results at the ward, constituency, as well as the county level and issue a provisional certificate.Mbadi, however, said since the certificates do not have adequate security features, Orange House will issue nomination certificates. The team has also acquired voting materials.
