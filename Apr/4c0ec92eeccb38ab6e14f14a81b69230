Kenyans on Twitter are torn about reports that ODM's Raila Odinga will be presidential candidate and Wiper's Kalonzo Musyoka his running mate.The NASA technical committee settled for the two but the final decision will be by the four principals - the other two are Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula (Ford Kenya) and Musalia Mudavadi (Amani National Congress).This will be by consensus.Kalonzo and Amani have dismissed claims that Raila will fly the Opposition flag.More on this: It's Raila-Kalonzo! NASA experts sayAlso read: NASA flag bearer choice rests with principals, not committee - KalonzoVia Twitter hash tag #NASAExpertsFolly, members of the public have stated their interpretations of the reports, some alleging foul play and others weighing the possibility that the team would trounce President Uhuru Kenyatta.Owili Junior criticised the committee saying it leaked the information to cause a rift among the principals."The fact that this leaked before It was deliberated on by the principals clearly shows someone is trying to drive a wedge between the leaders," he said.#NASAExpertsFolly It has now become clear who is the bully in NASA and we might soon expel tenants in our NASA and give Musalia peaceBritte Adams told off the coalition's coordinating committee, led by Siaya senator James Orengo, for letting the cat out of the bag before the chief reach a deal."We won't tolerate a fake opinion from the experts because how they pick is not our issue. The most important thing is to remove Jubilee from power," he wrote.All the propaganda of some NASA leaders quiting is the creation of @36bloggers they want to instill fear among the voters #nasaexpertsfollyRaila has vied for president three times before and lost. This was in 1997, 2002 and 2013. The August 8 general election is expected to be his last attempt.Samwel Nyamao said the Opposition leader will not yield results as he has failed in the past."A 'Railonzo 'combination is the same as giving students the same exam twice. The probability of winning is negligible given past failures," he said.#NASAExpertsFolly there are no experts in NASA, only one man with a combination of fatalism and a sinister feeling of always being chosen.Shadrack Andama welcomed the move but said delegates must take part in the decision-making."As NASA die-hards, we opt for delegates to nominate the flag bearer as it were in Kasarani in 2007. The mistake we made was setting up a team to select flag bearer...it lacked capacity to craft a winning strategy."As Uhuru continues to ask his tribemen to help him realize Jubilee agenda, NASA is sending them by 10 am #NASAExpertsFollyAll the NASA principals have said they want the ticket. Amani officials led by regional coordinator Major Malala said only Mudavadi can get votes from the opponent&rsquo;s strongholds.National Assembly minority leader Francis Nyenze said Kalonzo may go it alone if he is not named the NASA presidential candidate.The Wiper boss defended him saying he expressed a valid personal opinion that does not warrant the level of castigation that has greeted the assertions.A combination from NASA that takes Jubilee home, and thats we going for. We have the Numbers. #NASAExpertsFollyRaila's supporters have also boldly declared that he is their choice.Reminder: ODM is the strongest party in Africa and NASA flagbearer should come from there.
