Detectives in Mombasa are pursuing five gangsters, including two women, who were caught on camera stealing a bag from a British tourist at a restaurant in City Mall, Nyali, Mombasa.The bag contained six passports, Sh75,000, 200 Euros, jewelry and other valuables. The victim, a lady identified by police as Princess Moore-Sieray, was travelling with her daughters to Britain on Friday night at the time of the incident.According to the police, CCTV footage obtained from the Mall shows the gangsters stealing the bag before escaping in a waiting car. Kisauni police boss Christoper Rotich said they have circulated the details of the vehicle to assist in pursuing the suspects believed to be notorious criminals.&ldquo;We suspect they had trailed the lady from her hotel and they might have had prior information of the contents of her bag. We are appealing for public support,&rdquo; Rotich said.The CCTV footage shows two women, who posed as clients, coordinating with two male suspects to steal the bag.One of the male suspects is first seen pulling the bag from the tourist's side before his female accomplices pick it up.The female suspects are throughout the robbery seen talking on the phone.The second male suspect is seen engaging security officers manning the restaurant in a conversation, probably to distract them. Moments later, the four accomplices casually walked out of the restaurant with the bag to a waiting car and drove off.Detectives are trying to identify the gangsters in the footage by profiling their faces from the CCTV recording.
