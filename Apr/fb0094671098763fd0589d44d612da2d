A 21-year-old trekker from Taiwan has been rescued alive in the Himalayas, 47 days after he and his girlfriend went missing.A high-altitude search and rescue team found Liang Sheng Yueh in a canyon at around 2,600m (8,500ft) near Tipling village in Nepal's Dhading district.The body of his companion, 19-year-old Liu Chen Chun, was lying nearby.Liang is being treated at Grandee International Hospital in Kathmandu and is said to be out of danger.Dr Sanjaya Karki, who is treating Liang, told Surendra Phuyal of BBC Nepal: "He can speak slowly. He told me his girlfriend died three days ago. He doesn't have trauma injuries, but his body has injuries stemming from worm-bites."The trekker is said to have lost 30kg (4.5 stone) since going missing seven weeks ago. His hair was full of lice when he was found, and one foot was covered with maggots.Doctors said he appeared to have survived largely on water and salt.The BBC has learned that the stricken travellers were first sighted at 11:00 local time (05:15 GMT) by local people. A helicopter was immediately sent to the scene. Liang and Ms Liu, fifirst-yeartudents at Taiwan's National Dong Hwa University, had arrived in Nepal in February from India.They were last seen in northern Dhading on 9 March, where they had gone out trekking despite heavy snowfall.The website Missingtrekker.com reported that the couple had experienced some hardships before their trek, including missing luggage, and argued over "trivial matters".Liu reportedly wrote on Facebook: "I wish I had never ended up here."
