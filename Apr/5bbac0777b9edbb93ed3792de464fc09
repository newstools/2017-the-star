An intruder was shot dead by GSU personnel at State House Nairobi last Sunday, spokesman Manoah Esipisu has said.Esipisu said the unidentified man was shot near a perimeter fence far from main buildings within State House.&ldquo;[The incident] is being handled by security apparatus&rdquo;, Esipisu said on Sunday during a weekly briefing at the State Lodge Eldoret.He said President Uhuru Kenyatta was away attending a golf tournament in Muthaiga at the time of the incident.The suspect is said to have illegally accessed the highly-guarded grounds by jumping over the fence shortly before 5pm. It is unclear whether he was armed.The man was spotted by the elite GSU squad at the parking area near the main buildings before he was shot dead.Although there have been three intrusions since Uhuru took office in 2013, this is the first time it has resulted in a fatality.In March last year, a handcart pusher arrested and taken to court for jumping two fences and sneaking into State House.William Ngene provoked laughter with his explanation before Nairobi chief magistrate Daniel Ogemba.&ldquo;Your honour, I have never been to State House. I only see it on pictures and TV. I have seen all beautiful buildings in the city... I was curious," Ngene said.The court heard that the accused left his mkokoteni at Uhuru Park, passed through Central Park and headed to the heavily guarded location.He jumped over two fences upon arriving and assessing the area to make sure no one could see him.More on this: How curious handcart pusher jumped State House fence to see big house but ended up in a cell
