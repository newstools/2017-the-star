Opposition leader Raila Odinga&rsquo;s daughter Rosemary Odinga has bowed out of the Kibra constituency race, citing poor health.Rosemary, who has campaigned for the seat for two years, thanked Kibra residents for supporting her family for more than 30 years.She said she would continue serving them but in a different capacity.&ldquo;It is following my doctor&rsquo;s advice, that for the time being I will continue serving my community in other capacities and regrettably bow out of the race for Member of Parliament,&rdquo; she said in a video recording on her Facebook account yesterday.&ldquo;I would like to thank each and every person that supported my bid and the people of Kibra for opening their hearts and homes to me. I will forever cherish your outpouring love and prayers.&rdquo;Rosemary was diagnosed with a non-cancerous brain tumour, meningioma, in February and she was treated in South Africa, where she is recovering.A meningioma can cause blindness, problems with movement and multiple other complications as it grows and presses into the brain.It is not immediately life-threatening but remains a serious threat to Rosemary&rsquo;s health, as it is in the meninges &ndash; the lining between the brain and the skull.Rosemary urged Kibra residents to work on developing their lives and making better days for the future in and out of politics.&ldquo;To my sisters, brothers, mothers and fathers of Kibra, we always knew the journey was not and will not be easy. You are known the world over for standing up for what you believe is right. Do not let anyone extinguish that flame,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;I must say, the past two years have been the honour of my life getting to engage in the place known as the &lsquo;Heartbeat&rsquo; of Kenyan politics, not only as a voter but also as a competitor.&rdquo;It is the first time she has spoken openly after she was flown out for surgery.Rosemary, 39, is functionally the first-born, following the death of her older brother Fidel on January 4, 2015. Her younger siblings are Raila Odinga Jr and Winnie Odinga.
