AFC Leopards have been ordered to pay a fine of Sh150,000 as punishment for crowd trouble. The Kenyan Premier League&rsquo;s Independent Disciplinary and Complaints Committee also rebuked AFC Leopards for failing to help in identifying a particular spectator who had caused trouble in their league match against Kakamega Homeboyz at Mumias Sports Complex on August 18, 2016.The Kenyan Premier League had charged AFC Leopards following incidents of stone throwing by fans attributed to them during the match against Homeboyz.The supporters aimed their missiles at the first assistant referee, Stephen Oduor following a decision he had made against AFC Leopards, prompting the match to be stopped for about five minutes.Oduor sustained a cut on his left thigh that needed medical attention. IDCC consequently ruled that AFC Leopards pay Oduor Sh2,000 to compensate for his medical expenditure and Sh25,000 for his pain and suffering. &ldquo;As we have observed, the respondent (AFC Leopards) knows the perpetrator of the incident in question but refuses to give him up despite what he did. Knowing the environment in which football matches are played in Kenya, we would have been prepared to spare the respondent if they had taken responsibility and taken action against the person in question for assaulting the first assistant teferee. The respondent is not remorseful and appears keen on helping the person get away with what is in fact a criminal offence,&rdquo; IDCC observed. The IDCC is the tribunal for resolving disputes in the game of football, managed under the auspices of the Kenyan Premier League Limited.
