Plans to have the Political Parties Disputes Tribunal sit and handle election disputes in various parts of the country have failed.The Judiciary had proposed to Parliament an amendment to the Political Parties Act 2011 to empower the Judicial Service Commission to appoint at least 15 ad hoc members of the Political Parties Disputes Tribunal to sit in various parts of the country.The move is aimed at enhancing capacity, access and efficiency in the resolution of electoral disputes. However, the proposed amendments have not yet been passed due to shortage of staff.The PPDT will therefore not hear and determine nomination disputes.Speaking during the swearing in of two members of the PPDT yesterday, Chief Justice David Maraga (pictured) said the Judiciary is well prepared to handle election disputes. Desma Otieno and Hassan Abdi Ahmed were sworn in. He said judicial officers have been trained, and he has so far gazetted 92 special magistrates to deal with electoral offences.Maraga announced he will assign at least six judges of the High Court who will preside over appeals arising from decisions made by the PPDT. &ldquo;I assure Kenyans that the courts and the tribunal will handle election disputes with speed, guided by timelines of the electoral process in accordance with the law,&rdquo; he said.PPDT chairperson Kyalo Mbobu said because the tribunal has seven members, it will sit as two separate benches of three members each.
