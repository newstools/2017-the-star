Jubilee Party nominations in Narok, Bomet and Kericho scheduled for Friday were called off following a shortage of ballot papers.Aspirants and voters arrived at various polling stations only to find inadequate ballot papers.They waited for many hours before returning to their homes.Angry residents of Suswa, Narok East constituency, blocked the Narok-Mai Mahiu road for one hour to protest against the unpreparedness.Jubilee South Rift Coordinator John Melita said they have postponed the exercise after it was delayed for six hours. Voting was supposed to begin at 5am and end at 5pm.Melita was speaking to the press in the county tallying centre at Narok Boys High School on Friday.He said they have tasked the returning officers to do an audit of missing materials.&ldquo;We want them to come up with the number of missing materials per polling station so that we can communicate that to the main office for all six constituencies in Narok county,&rdquo; Melita said.He said apart from ballot papers, the rest of the materials had been provided. Melita appealed for calm as they solved the problems.&ldquo;We were given a directive by Jubilee&rsquo;s main office to postpone the exercise, but not to give the day of the repeat exercise. We shall meet today [Saturday] and inform them of the problem, and then agree on the day we will conduct our nominations,&rdquo; he said.But party supporters who had camped outside the tallying centre for the better part of the day alleged foul play.&ldquo;I think Jubilee wants to impose leaders on us, and that is why they want to rig the polls in their favour,&rdquo; said Jacob Langat, a resident of Mulot. &ldquo;If they don&rsquo;t allow us to exercise our democratic rights, then they will be in for a rude shock in the August general election because we will vote in leaders in other parties like Chama Cha Mashinani.&rdquo;
