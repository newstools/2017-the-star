Nyandarua Governor Daniel Waithaka yesterday alleged the Jubilee Party secretariat and Administration Police orchestrated the nominations mess on Friday. He said while President Uhuru Kenyatta had made it clear that the JP primaries would be free, fair and credible, and no aspirant would be handed a direct ticket, there are some people who &ldquo;have been compromised to manipulate the nominations in their favour&rdquo;. Waithaka warned any attempt to impose a candidate on the people of Nyandarua will be resisted because it &ldquo;could have devastating consequences on the continued goodwill enjoyed by the Jubilee Party in Nyandarua&rdquo;. He spoke during a press conference at Royal Gardens Hotel, Ol Kalou.
