Alcohol consumption among persons living with HIV is hampering the war against the scourge in Kenya, a new study shows.The study conducted by two researchers from Brown University showed that alcohol intake undermines the fight against the virus that causes Aids.This is because as it makes one more vulnerable to engaging in risky sexual behavior.Alcohol also undermines one's health by reducing the efficacy of ARVs in the patients' immune system. The study done in Western Kenya focused on introducing a culturally adapted program, known as the cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).This will be used to promote alcohol abstinence among HIV persons. &ldquo;Public health research shows that alcohol may be a factor in more than 13 percent of deaths due to infectious diseases, including HIV,&rdquo; read part of the study.Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is a short-term, goal-oriented psychotherapy treatment that takes a hands-on, practical approach to solve a problem. Its goal is to change patterns of thinking or behavior that are behind people's difficulties, and so change the way they feel.The treatment mode helps participants explore their thoughts, actions, and feelings in situations where the risk of drinking is acute so that they resist.&ldquo;This therapy was selected for the Kenyan since it works for both individual and group formats to reduce substance abuse,&rdquo; read the report.About 700 persons who are living with HIV and also take alcohol took part in the study.The research showed that if the country had trained paraprofessionals, they could boost alcohol abstinence rates to 69 per cent.This is just compared with just 38 per cent using the prior standard of care.Paraprofessionals are persons to whom a particular aspect of a task is delegated but who are not licensed to practice as a fully qualified professional.Kenya has 1.5 million people living with HIV. Out of this number, more than 800,000 of them are on lifelong treatment.Currently, there is no &lsquo;safe&rsquo; level of alcohol use recommended for persons living with HIV.However, a number of studies have found that heavy drinkers and those with alcohol problems have lower CD4 counts than moderate drinkers.The group is likely to have more copies of the HIV in their body.Alcohol has negative effects on people living with HIV, both on their bodies and how they behave.The effects of alcohol on HIV infection depend on how much a person drinks.It weakens the immune system and lowers CD4 counts.
