The incumbent is trying to rig," a voter claimed.The voters stormed the office demanding explanations before a contingent of GSU officers dispersed them.They engaged the police in running battles. Kuria's rival Waweru Joseph said the elections must be fair adding that the Kuria was planning to manipulate the primaries. "The elections must be fair. We are disagreeing with this. Mr President, come and intervene," he said.Waweru said the ballot materials have been in the county for the longest time."Somebody is playing with our minds. We are understanding that the boxes are here...they were brought here last week," he said.But Jubilee top leadership, when they cancelled Friday nominations, said fresh ballot papers will be dispatched for the poll. Joseph Njoroge, another aspirant, said the commissioner did not want them to inspect the police officer's vehicle.Read: Jump ship if you think primaries will be rigged &ndash; Kuria
