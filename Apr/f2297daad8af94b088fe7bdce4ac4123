Nakuru governor aspirant John Mututho wants Jubilee&rsquo;s repeat primaries to be credible and fair, and called for more officials to man the exercise. He said hopefuls lost millions of shillings following the cancellation of the polls last Friday. Addressing the press in Naivasha, Mututho said it is time Jubilee embraced electronic voting.
