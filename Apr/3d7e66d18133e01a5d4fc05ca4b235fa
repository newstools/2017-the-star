There is no experience on earth more disturbing than watching another human being struggling to stay alive. Yet that is the precise reality that the doctors and nurses who work in emergency rooms encounter every day. Most often, the person they are treating is a stranger, and they often arrive at the hospital alone, with no one to speak on their behalf. With little information to guide their decision making and no time to seek out family and friends, these healthcare professionals are forced to make life and death decisions in the blink of an eye.&ldquo;Extremis,&rdquo; a short film by director Dan Krauss, is about the gut-wrenching consequences that all too often follow the decision to save a life. Set in the Intensive Care Unit of Highland Hospital in Oakland, California, it follows palliative care specialist Dr Jessica Zitter as she works with several families whose loved ones are being cared for in the ICU. Just 24-minutes long, the film is a powerful and incredibly intimate view of how difficult end-of-life decision making can be for physicians and families alike. At the beginning of the film, we meet Donna and her husband, Gordon. Donna has been living with a progressive form of muscular dystrophy for many years, and she is now nearing the end of her life. Donna&rsquo;s family is more at peace, having had time to adjust to her diagnosis, and plan, as best they could, for what is to come. Yet Gordon&rsquo;s pain is no less horrible to watch. When his wife finally tells the doctor to remove the tube and refuses further intervention, he tries one last time to reassure himself that this is what she wants.&ldquo;Extremis&rdquo; is an important film. In a little less than half an hour, it draws us inexorably into the tragic, awful, yet deeply beautiful place where life and death meet. It is raw and emotional and painful to watch.
