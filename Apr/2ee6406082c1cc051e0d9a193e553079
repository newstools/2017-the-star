Nominated Senator Emma Mbura (pictured) yesterday accused Kilifi and Mombasa leaders of doing little to highlight the plight of EPZ workers.She said the Export Processing Zone workers&rsquo; rights have been violated with impunity, yet leaders are silent. &ldquo;It is sad that we have leaders who were elected to represent the people, but they are not doing their job, not even highlighting the plight of the EPZ workers,&rdquo; Mbura said on the phone. On Wednesday last week, she asked the Senate to investigate and come up with a detailed report on the violations of EPZ workers&rsquo; rights in Mazeras, Rabai constituency. There are more than 40,000 workers in 21 EPZ firms. The majority of the workers are women. Mbura told the Senate there are numerous claims female EPZ workers are sexually harassed by their supervisors and bosses.
