Two men were kicked out.Other supporters said there were suspicions that the process was flawed."We had our own tallying centres and we know that Otuoma has won. We have issues with Teso North and Teso South," he said.On Thursday, two ODM leaders in Busia and another in Bungoma county nursed injuries following chaos and confusion that rocked the party&rsquo;s primaries that kicked off.Despite tough talk by party honchos to rein in violence, Busia sub-branch treasurer David Otini and Angurai South ward chairman Joseph Okware were beaten by goons.The ODM secretary for Webuye sub-branch was also hospitalised after being assaulted for allegedly favouring a particular candidate.The primaries are a do-or-die for opposition chief Raila Odinga&rsquo;s key allies and is promising to end the careers of some of the big names in the Kenyan political landscape.In Teso South, the names of two parliamentary aspirants, Jeff Osiba and Geoffrey Omuse were missing from the ballot papers, heightening suspicion.
