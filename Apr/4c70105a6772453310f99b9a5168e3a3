Gikomba market is known as the hub of quality second-hand clothes and other goods, available at the fairest prices.It is East Africa&rsquo;s largest open-air market and one of the highest sources of the county&rsquo;s revenue. Shoppers visit it to buy international second-hand designer clothes, shoes from outfitters that are not available locally, and everything from furniture to cereals to hardware materials and groceries, among others, sold in retail and wholesale.Turn - off to customer But a visit to the market is fast becoming a harrowing experience due to poor roads to the market. Traders say the roads are getting almost impassable, making would-be customers keep off.The traders and other users of the roads to the market say they voted for Governor Evans Kidero in the hope that he would repair the roads and end the congestion menace in the market.But now, they are lamenting that Kidero&rsquo;s first term is nearing its end without him keeping his election promise to repair the roads and improve the road network.Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli, whose office is in Gikomba, criticised Kidero for the delay to fix the roads.In 2013, during the annual shop stewards&rsquo; meeting, Atwoli said he helped Kidero win the seat after he promised to tarmac Digo Road, which was expected to open up the market, ease movement of vehicles and reduce traffic snarl-ups.Atwoli is now furious the promise has not been kept and has announced that workers should support a results-oriented leader.The utterances of the workers&rsquo; defender are likely to complicate Kidero&rsquo;s re-election bid in the August 8 general election, given Atwoli&rsquo;s influence. More so since many roads in the city are also still unrepaired, not just the Gikomba roads.Gikomba stands out as it is a cash cow for the county, and traders who feel betrayed by Kidero might vote him out to try another aspirant.Traders and matatu operators who spoke to the Star accused Kidero of neglecting the roads and said they would take it out on him at the ballot.Joel Kiragu, the Gikomba Matatu Drivers&rsquo; Association leader, said the roads get impassable whenever it rains.&ldquo;We always pray that it doesn&rsquo;t rain because rains will ground our business,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Many shoppers keep off the market when potholes become full of stagnant water. Those who make it sometimes have to be carried on the back by porters at Sh50 to Sh100 to avoid the muddy roads.&rdquo;Kiragu said businessmen around the market must buy or hire gumboots at Sh 50 to Sh100 to walk around, but many customers avoid the market due to health hazards posed by the dirty waters and raw sewage.&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t our governor see this and have pity on us? He pretends not to have seen or heard our plight,&rdquo; he said.Driver Peter Mwangi said the bad roads cause them huge losses, as they spend a lot of time and money repairing damages caused by potholes.&ldquo;We are really suffering and we urge the governor and his people to come to our help and fix these roads,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Let Kidero honour his promise or we will revenge at the ballot.&rdquo;He said the drainage system of the road is poor and full of sewage refuse, including waste from the Pumwani Hospital.&ldquo;This is dangerous to our health because we spend most of our time here during our businesses and even eat food that has been prepared here,&rdquo; Mwangi said.Trader Omondi Okeyo said they benefit whenever Cotu makes an effort to improve the situation.&ldquo;We thank Atwoli so much because his bouncers assist us severally in opening up traffic whenever he is in his office, which makes our business easier,&rdquo; he said.Okeyo said Cotu also does some cleaning whenever they have some visitors coming to their office.He said Cotu hosts a lot of visitors on a daily basis and the road should be tarmacked to avoid giving a bad image to the visitors.Road blockages Some traders said fellow businesspeople take advantage of the lack of regulation by the city inspectorate to extend their shops to the road, which blocks the drainage.&ldquo;Some are selling their timber on top of the drainage system. How do they expect drainage to flow?&rdquo; Paul Wafula said.Kiragu said the National Youth Service has been trying to open up the drainage system but some places have been blocked by businesspeople who have opened hardware stores and stalls on top of sewer lines.&ldquo;The NYS comes to collect the papers from the drainage system and put them on top of the footpath to dry, but after a week, the papers are driven back to the drainage system by the wind,&rdquo; Kiragu said.He said some people block the road using carts, whereby they park their carts on the road as they wait for customers carrying goods from the market.&ldquo;This really causes traffic snarl-ups because these people have nowhere else to park their carts and there is nothing you can do,&rdquo; Kiragu said.Trader Collins Muriungi said: &ldquo;When he came to campaign here in 2012, he promised to tarmac Digo Road, which runs through OTC and California estate .This is the end of his term and we have seen no development.&rdquo;Last year, during another annual shop stewards&rsquo; meeting, Atwoli said Cotu hosts international leaders and it&rsquo;s a shame for visitors to witness such a poor state of the road.These include International Labour Organisation director Guy Ryder from Switzerland as well as delegations from the General Trade Union of Workers in Agriculture and Irrigation, based in Egypt, and the Organisation of African Trade Union, based in Ghana.&ldquo;I am a global leader but sometimes I feel ashamed to invite such icons because of the poor and debilitated conditions of Digo Road, the road joining Gikomba to CBD through OTC to the Solidarity Building, which is Cotu headquarters,&rdquo; Atwoli said.'Respect workers'It&rsquo;s against this background drop that the labour practitioner is not happy with the Nairobi governor.&ldquo;Almost all governors respect workers,&rdquo; Atwoli said. &ldquo;Governor Peter Munya (Meru), Paul Chepkwony (Kericho), Wycliffe Oparanya (Kakamega), Moses Akaranga (Vihiga) all work closely with my members in the tea industry because they respect workers.&rdquo;He added: &ldquo;For instance, Governor Chepkwony works closely with my members in the tea industry, although he is a recognised professor of chemistry. Governor Akaranga travels all the way from Western to come and consult.&rdquo;In 2013, Kidero, a Cord candidate, battled with Jubilee&rsquo;s Ferdinand Waititu. He had an upper hand because the urban dwellers wanted a professional to be a governor.However, the perceived neglect by his administration might change the voting pattern of the Gikomba traders and workers as a whole, because traders suffer a lot, sometimes being marooned by stagnant waters all over Digo Road while carrying heavy loads.It now seems Kidero is in a race against time to restore the confidence of traders and water down Cotu&rsquo;s influence by tarmacking Digo Road in the remaining days of his tenure.Poor services and the high number of stalled infrastructural projects could be attributed to failure by City Hall to meet its revenue targets in the last three financial years.A report on implementation of the Ward Development Fund released in February showed that 181 infrastructural projects worth Sh1.3 billion in the county&rsquo;s 85 wards have stalled since 2013.According to the 2017-18 County Fiscal Strategy Paper published on the county&rsquo;s website, the city collected Sh11.7 billion in the 2015-16 financial year against a target of Sh15.2 billion. This was a shortfall of 23.5 per cent or Sh3.5 billion.At a forum in October, officials were taken to task by residents over stalled projects, despite allocations.&ldquo;Most contractors doing business with the county have terminated their contracts over nonpayment. They can&rsquo;t stretch more while the county fails to honour their deal,&rdquo; Public Works director Frederick Karanja said.
