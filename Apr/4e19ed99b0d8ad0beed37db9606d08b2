Several people were injured as bodyguards of businessman Bundotich Kiprop, popularly known as Buzeki, fired in the air to disperse youths who attacked his convoy in Eldoret town on Saturday.The attack took place at a bridge on the Eldoret-Kisumu road.Buzeki, who lost to Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago in the JP primaries, escaped unhurt, but one bodyguard had his hand broken, as several others nursed injuries. He rejected Mandago&rsquo;s victory and lodged an appeal with the party.Buzeki was returning to the town to address his supporters, but his convoy was blocked by youths who waved placards in support of Mandago. They pelted the convoy with stones.Four vehicles, including the one that carried Buzeki, were extensively damaged. Buzeki blamed the attack on Mandago and MPs Oscar Sudi (Kapseret) and Alfred Keter (Nandi Hills).&ldquo;This is primitive politics, which Mandago and his group should stop perpetrating in Uasin Gishu,&rdquo; he said.But Mandago, Sudi and Keter distanced themselves from the incident and alleged Buzeki stage-managed the attack to attract sympathy.&ldquo;When he was away, Eldoret was peaceful. Now he comes back to incite residents,&rdquo; Mandago said.Buzeki demanded that the three be probed over alleged inciteful remarks they made in Eldoret. He claimed some communities are targeted after they backed him during the primaries. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not relent in my quest to ensure Uasin Gishu has good leaders. No amount of threats, violence or attacks will deter me. I&rsquo;ll fight for all communities,&rdquo; he said.
