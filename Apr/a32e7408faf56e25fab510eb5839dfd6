Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago has filed a petition in the Senate for conditional grants to build a referral hospital.The petition last Thursday was handed to the committee on Health. Mandago said the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital, which was upgraded from a level 4 to a level 6 facility, has not received conditional grants.&ldquo;The petitioners, therefore, pray that the Senate urgently considers this matter to ensure that the MTRH benefits from the conditional grant allocated to national referral hospitals in 2017-18 and subsequent financial years,&rdquo; Mandago says in the petition.MTRH is the country&rsquo;s second largest referral facility, serving Western, parts of Uganda and Southern Sudan. In 2014, Deputy President William Ruto said the government would relocate the hospital to the outskirts of Eldoret town at a cost of Sh20 billion. He said the government had already acquired 200 acres next to Eldoret Prison for the relocation. &ldquo;We are currently seeking funds &mdash; between Sh15 and Sh20 billion &mdash; which we believe will be enough for the exercise,&rdquo; Ruto said. He said the hospital has no room for expansion at its current location.Committee chairman and Migori Senator Wilfred Machage promised to expedite the petition. He said the hospital &ldquo;is in a unique situation&rdquo;, as it serves not only the whole country but patients from outside Kenya and thy are not charged an extra fee.
