A family in Oloibortoto, Kajiado West, is devastated by a rare condition afflicting and disfiguring a girl.Mwosia Lenjoi, 18, dropped out of school two years ago after she was overwhelmed by a cancerous growth on her tongue.Her father John Lenjoi on Tuesday said they have visited many hospitals. The family cannot afford the high cost of treatment and medication. Meantime, Mwosia&rsquo;s condition worsens. Family friend Joe Sirai early last year connected John to a foreign philanthropist who paid for Mwosia&rsquo;s surgery in China.She seemed well after the operation, but a month after arriving from China, the growth grew back &ndash; this time much faster. Mwosia is in a lot of pain. An about-turn to a life that was promising. John&rsquo;s herd of cattle, which sustained the family, has perished in the drought. They depend on well-wishers for upkeep.John appealed to the government and well-wishers to come to Mwosia&rsquo;s rescue. He can be reached on 0723496770.John said he has nowhere to turn to and prays for divine intervention. He prays regularly for his firstborn daughter. Mwosia cannot eat solid food. She survives only on milk and uses a straw to drink it.&ldquo;We are praying day and night for our daughter. We have no one to turn to but God. Kenyatta National Hospital requires a lot of money. I can&rsquo;t even afford bus fare to Nairobi,&rdquo; the distraught father said.John wants her admitted to KNH or any facility that can save her.
