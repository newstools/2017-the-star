Nairobi businesswoman Esther Passaris has joined ODM.Passaris who wanted to vie for the Nairobi governor seat said she was going to run for Nairobi woman representative."For Kenya to be united we must choose baba (Raila Odinga) as the NASA presidential candidate," Passaris said when she addressed Kibra residents on Sunday."I have returned home to ODM," she added.Earlier the businesswoman conducted a poll on her twitter account on whether to vie for gubernatorial seat or woman rep."My aspirations for Governor are proving to be unrealistic for 2017 for many reasons and for that I am sorry. What next? Lets Win Together," she posted.Some 41 per cent of her followers voted woman rep with 37 per cent voting for MCA, 12 per cent MP and 10 per cent Nairobi senator."Thank you to all who took the time to poll. Leadership is not about the leaders needs but the wants and needs of the people," Passaris said.In a poll last year, Passaris was termed the preferred candidate to vie for women rep and was rated at at 29 per cent.She was followed by Rachel Shebesh at 26 per cent. At the time neither Passaris nor Shebesh had declared intentions to vie for the seat.Read: Team Nairobi is no match for Peter Kenneth - Murang'a leadersGovernor Evans Kidero's seat has attracted interests in many politicians which include Senator Mike Sonko and former Gatanga MP Peter Kenneth who intend to vie for the seat on a Jubilee ticket.Jubilee has been split over Kenneth's bid. Initially, Jubilee had formed Team Nairobi which had Sonko, Wanjiru, MPs Dennis Waweru (Dagoretti South) and Johnson Sakaja (nominated).But Sakaja dropped out and instead opted to run for Senator, while Waweru opted to defend his seat.Sonko and Wanjiru are now facing off with Kenneth, who enjoy the support of MPs Maina Kamanda (Starehe MP), James Gakuya (Embakasi North), Rachel Shebesh (Nairobi woman rep) and Beatrice Elachi (nominated Senator).More recently, Sonko hinted that he would vie with NASA if Jubilee continue to victimise him.Also read: Sonko dismisses Peter Kenneth running mate report as 'joke of the year'
