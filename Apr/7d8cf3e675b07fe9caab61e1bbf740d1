The National Environmental Management Authority should be
supported for its move to enforce the clearance of electioneering posters, after
the August 8 election, put up by candidates. Nema officials yesterday announced the deposit bond will be
refundable, but only if the aspirants clear their posters and the Authority
ascertains the cleanup (see report P7). The deposit bond will be deposited in the Nema Environment
Restoration Fund account with the assistance of the county governments. Nema, the IEBC and the Council of Governors need to meet and
give directions, including agreeing on the bond amount. Every available outdoors space is taken up by the most
garish electioneering materials during general election campaign periods.
Things become worse when predatory rivals paste their own materials on top on
of other candidates’. In worst-case scenarios – and they proliferate – even road
signs and shop fronts are covered up. And then there is the use of indelible
spray can messaging, which covers walls, windows and highways. Candidates and their handlers should be encouraged to behave environmentally responsibly for once.
