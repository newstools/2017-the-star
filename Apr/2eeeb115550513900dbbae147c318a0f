Two people allegedly shot by the Kenya Defence Force soldiers during a security operation in Muwarak, Laikipia, on Wednesday are receiving treatment at the Kenyatta National Hospital and Samburu County Referral Hospital. Dr Boniface Atandi at the Samburu hospital confirmed the victims had gunshot wounds. He said one was hurt on the chest, while the other has face injuries. Laikipia North deputy county commissioner Evans Nganga said the incident occurred on Laikipia North and Laikipia West border. His Laikipia West counterpart Samuel Kiarie said he is aware of the shooting, but denied it happened in his area of jurisdiction. Nganga, however, said he will work with Kiarie in carrying out investigations. Daniel Lesamaja, a brother of one of the victims, said: &ldquo;It pains that my brother has been hurt by the government of Kenya, a government that I voted for.&rdquo;
