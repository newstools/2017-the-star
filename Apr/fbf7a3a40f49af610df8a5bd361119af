Comply with President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s directive and pay the doctors who went on strike, Labour CS Phyllis Kandie has urged. The government wants governors across the 47 counties to pay the medics who ended their 100-day strike mid-March to avert further industrial action.Kandie was speaking during a prize giving ceremony at Kapropita Girls&rsquo; High School in Baringo county on Friday.Through CS Kandie, Uhuru also wants their pay increase, as agreed, to be effected and all allowances paid before the August 8 general election.&ldquo;You should not wait any longer to implement the directive issued by the Head of State,&rdquo; Kandie said.She said failure to obey the order will jeopardise the return-to-work formula signed by the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union and the government on March 16.&ldquo;My appeal to governors is that they should ensure doctors get their dues in good time before things get worse,&rdquo; Kandie (pictured) said.She said the buck now stops with the governors to meet their end of the bargain.Meanwhile, she asked public servants to shun &ldquo;the culture of strikes&rdquo; and instead embrace dialogue to solve work grievances. &ldquo;Strikes should be a thing of the past in a civilised nation,&rdquo; Kandie said.Bartabwa MCA Reuben Chepsongol supported the CS, saying the county chiefs have no choice but to obey Uhuru&rsquo;s directive.&ldquo;No one should deny the doctors their rights since the President himself has issued the order,&rdquo; Chepsongol said.On Wednesday, Uhuru directed governors to pay doctors all their dues for the period they were on strike.
