Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero has criticised the Jubilee Party, saying it does not have plans for residents and is only interested in removing him from the post.&ldquo;The sad thing is that their drive is to remove me. The issue is not me, the issue is services to Nairobians. Every time they meet, &lsquo;hadi tutoe Kidero&rsquo; (until we vote out Kidero),&rdquo; he said.Kidero said his opponents ignore his achievements, but peddle propaganda that he has failed.Addressing journalists after attending an SDA church service at Railways Club on Saturday, the governor said he has performed well and deserves to be reelected.Jubilee politicians have accused Kidero of being a let-down. They say his administration has failed to tackle the garbage menace and traffic jams, and the cost of doing business is high.But Kidero said his opponents are trying to &ldquo;blind&rdquo; everybody so they can be elected. He said he has improved services, including garbage collection.
