Bungoma JP woman representative contestants have been at daggers drawn for weeks as they wooed residents for support.This is expected to end after today&rsquo;s nomination. Maria Nato is seeking to wrest the seat from incumbent Reginalda Wanyonyi. Both want the JP ticket.The two have been traversing the county, meeting residents in funerals, fundraisers, churches, rallies and other social events.Nato, wife of a Bungoma bishop, is perceived to enjoy popularity in the media and on the ground, with speculation rife that she is fronted by Governor Kenneth Lusaka.Sources privy to the intrgues say Lusaka prefers Nato because he believes Wanyonyi could easily be beaten by candidates of rival parties on August 8.Nato has promised to empower residents, especially women, and uplift their living standards. She accuses Wanyonyi of doing little to fix the problems faced by women.&ldquo;Our mothers, sisters and daughters, who are the engine of our county, need to be attended to in a special way by coming up with programmes like the ones I have [proposed],&rdquo; Nato said.&ldquo;The programmes will change their lives. Empowerment starts with educating our young girls.&rdquo;But Wanyonyi dismisses the hopeful, saying she has done a lot to empower Bungoma women through development projects.She expressed confidence that she will win the JP ticket and go ahead to recapture the seat. &ldquo;Ousting me won&rsquo;t be a walk in the park,&rdquo; Wanyonyi said.
