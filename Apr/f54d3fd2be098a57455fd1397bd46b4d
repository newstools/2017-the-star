Two Migori politicians are facing petitions written to ODM and the electoral agency to be barred from the Friday primaries. In a petition, civil servants from Siaya county led by Ogaja Ogaja wanted secretary general Tom Odege under the Kenya Union of Civil Servants barred from the exercise over integrity issues.The petition accuses Odege, an aspirant for Nyatike MP seat, for abuse of the office and engagement in financial mismanagement.Reacting to the petition to the press, Odege said the petitioners were wasting time and were sent by his political rivals to derail his bid. Odege said if the issues raised involved the union, then the petition should have been sent to the union&rsquo;s offices in Nairobi, which he said is yet to receive any copy, &ldquo;We have not seen the papers. If the member of the union has any issue with the office, the matter should be handled internally. Why take it to the party if it is not politically motivated?&rdquo; he asked. Odege said his political bid to be the next Nyatike MP will not be stopped, adding that the petition is a waste of time and resources. Speaking separately to the Star, former Migori speaker and senator aspirant Gordon Ogolla (pictured) said they have been alerted that one of his rivals will file a similar petition on Tuesday. &ldquo;We have been alerted that a petitioner has been sponsored and will try to file it on Tuesday. We know of the plot and will wait for it. Until then we will treat it as rumours by our rivals who have sensed defeat,&rdquo; he said. The petition will likely touch on Ogolla&rsquo;s time as speaker, in which he was impeached by MCAs in 2015 over claims of corruption and abuse of office.The case is still at the Court of Appeal.
