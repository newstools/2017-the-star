Kristoff and Gabu are two artistes who have brought about new and fresh heat in the industry. Just like any other superstar, they too have groupies who thirst over them. It's pretty hard for an artiste to handle groupies in a way that won't complicate matters for them.In an exclusive interview with Word Is, Gabu said: "For groupies, I just let them talk and eventually they will forget the story, because a groupie is not someone who supports you; she's just there to get something from you. So don't give them that," Gabu said.Kristoff added: "You basically don't give them the time of day. Just open a WhatsApp group and they can see you from there. And that's why we wear sunglasses and do our thing."
