Kerich was arrested on Wednesday after members of the public and civil society groups stormed Burani police station, Matuga, where the girl was said to have been staying with the officer. The girl is a standard eight candidate at Burani Primary School. Kerich denied the charge before Kwale resident magistrate Paul Mutai on Thursday. He was released on Sh150,000 bond or Sh80,000 bail. The case will be mentioned on May 4, while the hearing was set for June 13.
