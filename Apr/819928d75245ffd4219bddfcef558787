Governor William Kabogo&rsquo;s claim &ldquo;someone&rdquo; in Jubilee schemed his downfall in the Kiambu nominations has sparked speculation about a renewed feud with Deputy President William Ruto.Kabogo on Tuesday evening said at a press briefing in Kiambu his defeat was plotted because &ldquo;I am a threat to someone&rdquo; and that Ruto and JP election officials did not address his concerns on planned nominations malpractices. Last year, Kabogo sparked off a debate in Jubilee following his remarks the vote-rich Mt Kenya region will not automatically back Ruto&rsquo;s 2022 presidential bid.Kabogo said on Monday, a day to the nominations, he went to the JP headquarters at Pangani and handed a memorandum to Ruto, National Elections Board chairman Andrew Musangi and JP secretary general Raphael Tuju. In the memorandum, Kabogo demanded the presiding and returning officers in some polling stations be changed, alleging they were partisan and allied to his rival and Kabete MP Ferdinand Waititu.&ldquo;I pushed through, of course I am not a pushover, and managed to see the Deputy President and he promised me the presiding officers would be changed. Tuju and Musangi did not fix the mess but aggravated it. There are rumours that I&rsquo;m a threat to someone. Someone does not want Kabogo as governor in next five years,&rdquo; he said. Musangi confirmed to the Star Kabogo presented the memorandum, they discussed the issues and reached a consensus on how the exercise should be conducted.&ldquo;The Deputy President does not handle elections. We only had a joint discussion and agreed on a joint solution of monitoring the process and agents. There was nothing else to be solved. We were in agreement he sends agents to those polling stations to monitor the exercise,&rdquo; he said.
