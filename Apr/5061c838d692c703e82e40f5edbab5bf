Congratulations and kindly let's focus ahead.&rdquo;Shaban played a central role in ensuring Taita Taveta Senator Dan Mwazo and woman representative Joyce Lay ditched ODM for Jubilee.Shaban said she will vigorously campaign for President Uhuru Kenyatta.The county is regarded an ODM stronghold, and if Shaban moves to the NASA coalition, Jubilee chances of getting votes from the region will be minimal.
