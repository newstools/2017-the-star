For the first time this season, football lovers in Nairobi will be able to watch SportPesa Premier League action live this afternoon as Sofapaka take on Kakamega Homeboyz after the 2009 champions were given the blessings of the KPL to use Jericho&rsquo;s Camp Toyoyo&rsquo;s stadium as one of their alternative home venues. KPL Jack Oguda confirmed Sofapaka had made the request and it was considered after all the requirements on safety and security including attendants risk were deemed satisfactory&ldquo;Sofapaka have the blessings of KPL to host some of their home matches at Camp Toyoyo, starting with their meeting with Kakamega Homeboyz,&rdquo; Oguda confirmed.Homeboyz chairman, Cleophas Shimanyula, had earlier voiced his concern over the belated decision to include Camp Toyoyo as an alternative venue. &ldquo;Jericho (Toyoyo) was not mentioned as an alternative venue before the league began and since we were not informed, we will consult KPL before making an official stance,&rdquo; said Shimanyula.The decision by KPL to have Camp Toyoyo host the top tier league for the first team was necessitated by the closure of three prime venues in Nairobi including Kasarani, City and Nyayo Stadium, which are undergoing repairs.Kasarani and Nyayo Stadium have temporarily closed its doors in readiness for the World Under-18 athletics Championships in July as well as the 2018 Africa Nations Championships (CHAN), which will be hosted in Kenya. The go ahead gives revitalised Sofapaka an opportunity to show their fans what they have been missing in the few weeks that &lsquo;Batoto Ba Mungu&rsquo; have criss-crossed the country for top flight matches&mdash; accumulating ten points in five matches. Sam Ssibwa&rsquo;s men are unbeaten in four matches in which the only blemish is a draw against champions Tusker. And with his side emerging as one of the highest scorers in the league, Homeboyz will have their work cut out to keep them at bay.Elsewhere, NYSA coach Fredrick Otieno anticipates a tough battle when he leads his charges against East Conference favourites and experienced Jericho FC in the highlight match of round 8 of the SportPesa Super 8 League at Ngong Posta grounds.Having managed to amass 11 points from three wins and two draws so far, newly promoted NYSA who won the SPS8 Div One League last season are presently sitting fifth on the 16-team chart and have a Herculean task ahead of them when they invite experienced Jericho who are sitting pretty at third on 12 points, just four behind leaders Kawangware United and a point ahead of their hosts.NYSA are win-less in four matches, in fact the last time they won a match was a month ago when they beat MASA 0-1 and were on top the table and coach Otieno believes they can return to their winning spirits as well at the top spot despite facing an experienced side.In other matches, newcomers Zamalek FC will be aiming to carry their unbeaten run into the fourth straight week when they travel to Ngong Posta grounds to tackle weaklings Ajax YouthAt Kabete ACK grounds, hosts Kabete United take on bottom placed Meltah Kabiria while East conference side Metro Sports FC welcome defending champions Kayole Asubuhi at their Drive Inn grounds.
