Kirinyaga Governor Joseph Ndathi has asked the Jubilee Party to ensure the party primaries to be held on April 21 are free and fair. He said the head office should not impose candidates on voters. Speaking at Kiamuthambi Catholic Church grounds in Kirinyaga on Friday, Ndathi said the people have the right to elect leaders of their choice. The governor is facing stiff competition in the JP primaries against former powerful Devolution CS Anne Waiguru and Kirinyaga Central MP Joseph Gitari.Last week during the County Election Board selection of members, supporters of Ndathi and Waiguru clashed and chaos marred the exercise. Ndathi who was summoned by the JP head office to shed light on the incident blamed Waiguru for the chaos and said she causes chaos.
