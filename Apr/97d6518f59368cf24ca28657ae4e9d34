Wipe your tears and fight. That old man can&rsquo;t make you feel defeated. Go Independent and win. #Starehe,&rdquo; Alen Wex posted.Thiongo Mugo said, &ldquo;You deserve it, buddy it&rsquo;s just a matter of time. God will turn your mourning into dancing. Don&rsquo;t give up.&rdquo;But others told Jaguar to allow Kamanda take the seat and face it off with Ukweli Party aspirant Boniface Mwangi. &ldquo;@RealJaguarKenya. You cannot cry your way to an election victory. Take a break, man up, grow some muscles, come back and fight! No surrender,&rdquo; Michael Murumba said.Free Mind said, &ldquo;@RealJaguarKenya. What have you invested in the party? Maybe nothing apart from the nomination fee... Kamanda is equal to @JubileePartyK.&rdquo;&ldquo;@JubileePartyK give @RealJaguarKenya his certificate. He won to face it off with @bonifacemwangi, who will beat him without a drop of tears,&rdquo; Kasuti Nabibia said.Earlier, Jaguar refused to negotiate with Maina Kamanda on the winner of the Starehe MP Jubilee polls.&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want negotiations ... I will not sit down with anyone and will not go back to the elections again. I&rsquo;m not ready to talk to him (Kamanda). Democracy is not about negotiation,&rdquo; Jaguar said.Kamanda had earlier said he was ready to dialogue with the musician.During the primaries, there were reports that Jaguar was tipped to win the Jubilee ticket.
