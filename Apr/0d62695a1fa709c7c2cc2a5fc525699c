The JP nominations were called off on Friday in Uasin Gishu, Nandi and Elgeyo Marakwet as ballot papers and other materials did not arrive at most polling stations.In Uasin Gishu, stiff competition is expected between Governor Jackson Mandago and Bundotich Kiprop, popularly known as Buzeki.&ldquo;We will wait for official communication from e party headquarters on the way forward,&rdquo; Jubilee regional coordinator for Nandi and Uasin Gishu Joseph Mathai said.He admitted there was an acute shortage of voting materials, despite having assured hopefuls early in the week the polls would be credible. Mathai said they had prepared well.Voters lined up in long queues early in the morning, but they became impatient when it emerged ballot papers were insufficient. This caused chaos at most polling stations.Mandago and Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi later announced that the poll had been called off, claiming there were plans to rig in certain contenders, whom they did not name.&ldquo;More than 95 per cent of aspirants are concerned the nominations will not be fair,&rdquo; Mandago said.&ldquo;The ballot papers so far distributed are far less than the number of registered voters.&rdquo;He urged his supporters to be peaceful and appealed to Jubilee officials to ensure the highest level of credibility in line with the wishes of party members.Some polling stations with as many as 7,000 voters had as little as 200 ballot papers. This was evident in MV Patel and Uasin Gishu Primary School.Buzeki addressed hundreds of his supporters in Eldoret town, urging calm and insisting that none of the aspirants be blamed for the failed exercise.He said the failures in the JP nominations took place in all regions, where they were to take place.
