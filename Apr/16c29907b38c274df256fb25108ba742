Former champions General Service Unit team coach Gideon Tarus says there is everything to play for at the Kenya Volleyball Federation second leg at Ndaka-ini this Friday.GSU are scheduled to play local rivals Kenya Prisons, Nairobi Water and Vihiga County. Tarus, a former national men&rsquo;s team assistant coach, is wary of the tie against Prisons. However, he was quick to note that his side will be out to turn tables after Prisons denied them the chance to retain the KVF title last season in a 3-2 win.&ldquo;We know they are fresh from featuring in the Africa Club Championship and without a doubt, they have picked experience and exposure in one way or the other. This will come in handy for them but we have equally trained hard and prepared well. We expect a tough and entertaining clash,&rdquo; observed Tarus.He continued: &ldquo;Having won 3-0 against Mombasa Prisons during the first leg in Nyeri, we are keen to build on this going forward. We haven&rsquo;t seen Kenya Prisons and Nairobi Water play in the league matches this season. They don&rsquo;t know what to expect from us and neither do we. But one thing I know is, we will be going for the nine points.&rdquo;Prisons shelved their first leg matches as they were preparing for the continental tournament, while the water boys skipped the matches inexplicably. Tarus observed that the season will be competitive if the last leg performance is anything to go.&ldquo;Teams posted good performances and as the league progress, they can only get better. Stakes to make it to the play-offs will be high and that is why we want to win all our matches and be among the last four teams,&rdquo; noted Tarus.
