My wife [Lucy Wanjiku] had already gotten a lover and was carrying on the affair openly,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They forged a will that shows my mother left them the land, with witnesses being my daughter Rose Wangari and my wife&rsquo;s lover Clement Kago. &ldquo;They appended their signatures on September 17, 2008, when my mother was admitted in the Kenyatta National Hospital.&rdquo; his inheritanceNdinguri said his immediate family ganged up with authorities and neighbours to force him out of the 25 acres he inherited from his parents.He said the land is still in his late father&rsquo;s name, Chrispus Mwaniki. Ndinguri said one day as he was leaving his house to run errands, he was confronted by his son and some neighbours, who started beating him.&ldquo;My wife then emerged armed with a metallic jar, and landed it on my head leaving me unconscious. The next thing I knew I was tied up with a rope and abandoned in a room,&rdquo; he said.Ndinguri freed himself and ran to his neighbours for help, but was turned away. He walked to Githunguri police station three kilometres away, and reported the assault. Although he was given a P3 form, no action was taken against his attackers.Ndinguri said his wife rented out most of the land to raise school fees, but he has not received a single penny of the money.Wanjiku did not pick calls from the Star for comment.
