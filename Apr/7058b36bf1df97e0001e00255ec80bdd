Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho escaped death narrowly yesterday after unknown persons shot at his vehicle during his visit to Migori.Joho, who was accompanied by Mvita MP Abdulswamad Nassir, was touring Migori county when supporters of Governor Okoth Obado clashed with supporters of governor aspirant Ochillo Ayacko.Speaking to the Star on the phone, Abdulswamad said the governor just &ldquo;cheated&rdquo; death. &ldquo;This was an assassination attempt and they were out to kill the governor,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;The car was shot at three times and it is by the Grace of God that we survived that attempt on our lives.&rdquo;He said a supporter who had just taken a selfie with Joho was, however, not lucky as the bullet hit him. Joho&rsquo;s bodyguard was shot in the left leg and was airlifted to Nairobi for treatment.Abdulswamad downplayed claims that there is bad blood between Obado and Joho, and blamed the attack on the rising political temperatures. However, Obado accused Joho and his entourage, who included senators Anyang&rsquo; Nyong&rsquo;o (Kisumu) and Siaya&rsquo;s James Orengo, of not informing him of the function of opening ODM offices.Obado criticised the team for visiting Migori unannounced to endorse Junet and Ayacko ahead of the April 19 primaries.&ldquo;Joho is the deputy party leader. He should be highly neutral. The problem is that my colleague is coming to my territory and I have been kept out of the programme,&rdquo; he said.Earlier, police had to fire in the air several times after two groups of youth supporting rival candidates pelted each other with stones in Migori town.Youths allied to Obado on the one hand and those supporting Suna East MP Junet Mohammed and governor aspirant, former Rongo MP Ayacko on the other engaged in fights.The area around Migori county stadium, the planned venue for the function, was a no go zone after youths overwhelmed the police.Earlier in the morning, angry youths demonstrated against Obado after ODM organisers were locked out of the Migori county stadium by the county government officials before moving to Posta Grounds, 200 metres away.Tension has been high since Sunday night, when an unknown attacker threw a petrol bomb at the new Migori county office that was to be opened yesterday.By the time of going to press the venue of the meeting was yet to be known as angry youths demonstrated in Migori town against Obado.
