President Uhuru Kenyatta has promised to work with leaders from the Northeastern region who will emerge winners in the August 8 general election. He said he will not interfere with clan politics, which largely determines voting patterns. Uhuru, who was campaigning for the Jubilee Party, urged the electorate to vote for whoever they want for other elective seats, but reelect him for his second and last presidential term. He said the PDR is affiliated to Jubilee and urged residents to support candidates running on the party ticket.Speaking during a political rally in Qorahey grounds, Uhuru said the Jubilee administration has achieved a lot under his leadership, and voters should not believe the lies being peddled by the opposition that the government has not delivered on its pledges.Uhuru was with Deputy President William Ruto, National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale and a host of other local leaders. The President said if reelected, he will ensure all households in the region are connected to electricity.Wajir county overwhelmingly voted for the opposition in the March 4, 2013 election, and is said to hold the swing vote in the region.During the Saturday rally, the Deputy President cautioned residents against &ldquo;repeating the mistake of voting for the opposition&rdquo; but instead vote for the Jubilee Party, which he described as the winning team.The President received some opposition leaders who defected to JP. They include Aden Keynan (Eldas), Mohamed Elmi (Tarbaj), Wajir Deputy Governor Abdihafid Yarrow and nominated senator Halima Kahiye.The rally was briefly disrupted after police pushed back a crowd of people for coming too close to the dais, which almost caused a stampede. Following the push and shove, angry residents started chanting ODM leader Raila Odinga&rsquo;s name and that of his party. But Ruto stopped the police and sanity was restored.
