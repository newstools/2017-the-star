Aspirants who create havoc on nomination day will be disqualified, even if they win, Jubilee Party at the Coast has said. Mombasa JP governor hopeful Suleiman Shahbal, his running mate lawyer Anania Mwaboza and JP Mombasa County coordinator Beatrice Gambo said the polls will be peaceful. “There has been a total agreement amongst all aspirants. Anyone who creates havoc on the nomination day will immediately be disqualified,” Shahbal said. He spoke during a press conference at JP Nyali offices on Wednesday afternoon. Shahbal said security arrangements have been put in place to avert chaos on the Tuesday nomination. “We are confident the administration will have the security situation in control. As a party we have also made our security arrangements,” he said. Some 22 counties, among them Taita Taveta, will conduct nominations today.
