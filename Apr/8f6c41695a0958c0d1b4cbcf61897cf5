A 29-year-old man killed his 16-year-old sister because she was pregnant then surrendered himself to Siritanyi police station.Kizito Wafula allegedly committed the crime in Misemwa village, Kanduyi, Bungoma county on Wednesday evening.He had had a longstanding dispute with standard eight pupil Abigail Wafula over the pregnancy, their father Emanuel Wafula told journalists yesterday.The girl was five months pregnant, he said.Abigail and Kizito had quarrelled then he kicked hard in the stomach, making her fall on the ground.She started writhing in pain and her relatives called a motorcycle to take her to hospital, but she died, her father said."I don&rsquo;t why Kizito, who is usually very temperamental, decided to beat her up. But he had previous been telling her that he will one day kill her for embarrassing our family," Emanuel said.He said his daughter was bright and index 13 and he had been expecting her to perform well in her studies despite being pregnant.Her mother at first refused to talk to journalists and only said they had sacrificed a lot to ensure she does not leave school so she could have a bright future.Neighbours, who flocked to the home, condemned the incident.Francis Wasike said Kizito would occasionally have a bitter quarrel with his sister asking her why she had gotten pregnant yet they had sacrificed many things to take her to school.Her body was taken to Bungoma County Referral Hospital morgue.Area assistant chief Alfred Wefafa said the beating was uncalled for and an embarrassment to the community.He suspects Kizito might have been drunk when he beat up his sister.Wefafa said he has known Kizito for some time and he is usually drunk.He warned residents against behaving in such a manner and urged them to find amicable solutions to problems."Cases of people in families fighting and killing each other have been on rise in this my area and I'm appealing to families to seek divine intervention in solving disputes," he said.Wefafa said Kizito, who has been transferred to Bungoma police station, will be arraigned in court and charged with his sister's murder.
