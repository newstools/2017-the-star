Siaya Senator James Orengo has left his supporters in suspense over his reelection bid seven days to ODM party primaries in the county.Orengo, who has not publicly said anything about his reelection bid, at some point caused jitters among Siaya governor aspirants after it was rumoured he was in the race.However, Orengo&rsquo;s name is on the list of Siaya senator aspirants in the IEBC&rsquo;s final list of ODM contenders released last week.Orengo will be battling it out with Margaret Oketch and Gem Argwings Kodhek for the ODM ticket.The two have launched a spirited campaign ahead of the ODM nominations, but Orengo has not even released a poster or banner, let alone tried to woo voters during rallies.The senator, who has been busy with ODM and NASA affairs at the national level, has made few trips to the county since he was elected. It&rsquo;s not a secret Orengo is among the political heavyweights in Nyanza and it seems he is sure of clinching the ODM ticket during nominations without campaigning.Last month, Orengo confirmed he is still in politics, but he didn&rsquo;t disclose which position he will be vying for. That was before his name appeared on the list of Siaya senator aspirants. In the last election, Orengo declared interest in the Senate seat two weeks to nominations after Raila&rsquo;s brother Oburu Oginga had already declared his interest in the seat.His entry in 2013 forced the party to prevail upon Oburu asking him to consider vying for governor in Siaya.Oburu shifted gears and went for the governorship position to battle it out with William Oduol for the ODM ticket before the shambolic nominations where the two were disqualified.This time round, it is not clear whether Orengo is still going to apply the same tactics of coming in late and surprising his opponents at the nominations.Efforts to seek his comment on when he plans to hit the ground to sell his policies for his reelection bid before nominations hit a snag as he didn&rsquo;t pick our calls.But his allies say the senator will be in the county soon to woo voters before nomination exercise that is slated on April 24.They said Orengo will use choppers and a fleet of cars.Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo expressed fears the &ldquo;blatant rigging&rdquo; of ODM primaries in Busia will be repeated in Siaya.Midiwo claimed county elections board members are allied to some leaders in the county headed by Cornel Rasanga.The legislator said last Friday they are likely to interfere with the nominations. Midiwo said Raila&rsquo;s party should prove it is democratic.
