Youths on Saturday night raided Murang&rsquo;a Governor Mwangi Wairia&rsquo;s campaign command centre in Gatanga, claiming they were looking for evidence that he was printing fake ballot papers.They raided the centre at 2am. They were ferried to the area in three matatus and were armed with crude weapons and guns.The youths were allegedly ferried from Muthithi market, but officers from the nearby Ndururumo police post dispersed them.Jane Mbuthia, who is part of the governor&rsquo;s campaign team and who is in charge of the centre, said the youths must have thought there was no one at the centre, since it was late in the night.&ldquo;Our people were at the centre branding our vehicles in readiness for Sunday rallies when the youths stormed in,&rdquo; she said.Mbuthia also said the youths could be heard shouting that they would not allow the governor to rig the nominations.She said the youths were heard saying they would go back and destroy the centre.Murang&rsquo;a county police commander Naomi Ichami said they received reports concerning the raid and they have launched investigations.She appealed for calm from all political camps, saying lawlessness will not be condoned.Wairia is seeking reelection for a second term. The governor is fighting to get the Jubilee Party ticket against Kigumo MP Jamleck Kamau after the third contestant, Moses Mwangi, decamped from the party last Thursday. Mwangi claimed the primaries would not be fair.Mwangi, who is yet to declare the party he decamped to, said his two opponents have &ldquo;perfected the art of deceit&rdquo; and may frustrate the party&rsquo;s efforts to deliver free and fair nominations.Kamau also accused Wairia of procuring a printing press that he has claimed was being used to print fake ballot papers in his name.On April 19, Kamau wrote to the party claiming that Wairia was also planning to print T-shirts bearing his name and distribute them to youths, who will then cause chaos and later lay blame on the MP.On April 20, Wairia, through his lawyer Mbugua Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a, wrote to JP asking the party to force Kamau to substantiate his claims.Wairia said if he fails to, the party should force him to retract the claims and apologise, and that appropriate action should be taken against Kamau.
