Former President Mwai Kibaki has opened up about his health, saying he is experiencing speech difficulties."I have a problem here, that is why my voice is so low," he said on Saturday while pointing at his throat. "It is good to talk the truth because there is nothing to hide," he added.Kibaki was speaking at Nanyuki Sports Club where Lakipia governor aspirant Nderitu Muriithi and his running mate John Mwaniki were unveiling their manifesto.Muriithi is a nephew to Kibaki and was Laikipia West MP legislator and Industrialisation assistant minister, while Mwaniki was the county secretary before he was sacked last year.The former President, who is believed to have endorsed the two, told residents to unite and demand services from elected leaders as it is their right.He said incidents of insecurity are contributing to low development in some areas.Despite his health, Kibaki said he is ready to go anywhere in the country he is needed.In August last year, Kibaki was flown to South Africa for specialised treatment after he reportedly suffered a stroke.The 84-year-old was discharged shortly afterwards.In May of the same year, Kibaki's wife Lucy died in a London hospital.Read: Kibaki is 'awake and talking contrary to negative reports' - family[VIDEO] Former First Lady Lucy Kibaki laid to rest
