Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya has dismissed the installation of street lights in Mumias East by the state, saying it is a county government function.He asked the national government to stop wasting time and resources playing politics on launching of street lights, water springs and market toilets.Oparanya said the state street lighting project is bound to fail because of the running costs. &ldquo;The national government will not be footing electricity bills for the lights, because that is not its function. What President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto are doing in Jubilee sympathetic constituencies is wrong and they are likely to collide with the governors,&rdquo; he said .Oparanya said the lights initiated by the national government in Malava constituency were not functional.&ldquo;This is a pure waste of public resources by the President. The lights cannot function if there is no contract between the two governments. KPLC will soon be switching off these lights. This money could have been diverted into viable projects under the national government to benefit the masses,&rdquo; he said.Oparanya spoke on Wednesday in Mumias town after touring Malava constituency, where he launched urban lighting project.&ldquo;We shall come to commission more lighting masts in upper towns like Lumakanda, Matete, Butali and Matunda in Malava constituency, before we move to other areas,&rdquo; he said.Oparanya told residents to be cautious, saying this being a political season, many leaders will clinch on straws that will keep them a float, even if they have not done anything.He said, &ldquo;The electricity transformers for the Last Mile Connectivity Project government project whose efforts and intentions were good was bound to fail in Kakamega county, because it landed in wrong hands.&rdquo;Oparanya said Jubilee MPs are taking the transformers in areas where they get support and leaving &ldquo;opposition zones&rdquo; in darkness.
