The group campaigning against Kiambu Governor William Kabogo has intensified its meet-the-people tours to convince voters to elect governor aspirant Ferdinand Waititu (Kabete MP).On Saturday afternoon, the Kiambu United Team toured Juja subcounty. At Witeithie Estate, Waititu said his team will be the solution for the problems Kiambu residents have faced under Kabogo&rsquo;s administration.He said his first task would be to ensure a foot bridge is erected at Witeithie Stage to reduce number of pedestrians hit by cars on the road.The legislator said markets, schools, dispensaries, roads and street lights would be top his agenda.&ldquo;If it will mean buying land to put up a decent market, we will,&rdquo; Waititu said.Dr James Nyoro said Kabogo&rsquo;s administration has not solved the problems Witeithie residents faced in 2013. Waititu&rsquo;s team will resolve the issues, he said.
