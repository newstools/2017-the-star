Major General KT Chepkuto in charge of the project said the government has bought all materials needed to build the wall.The army general said his men are providing security and expertise for the project. He praised leaders including Governor Ali Roba for the moral and political good will they have given to his team since the KDF took over from the National Youth Service. KDF engineers are supervising the works and a few civilians have been hired as masons. The governor praised the KDF saying they have accomplished a lot within a short time. Work began in May 2015.
