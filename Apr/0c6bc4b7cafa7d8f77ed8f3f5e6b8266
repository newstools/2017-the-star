There is debate whether candidates or political parties should tally
their votes at polling stations and relay them to their command posts
for tabulation. In each election, every political party is allowed to have agents in every polling centre. Their role is to be the 'eyes and ears' of their candidates and parties in those stations since no candidate can be omnipresent. The
agents verify that their candidate's votes are well tabulated and not
given to their opponent. At the end of the counting, they must relay the
results to a specific centre where party statisticians will be busy
doing the calculations. It is, therefore, foolhardy to have agents
at polling centres but not allow a candidate to add up his or her votes
at a central point. The only illegal thing would be to publicly announce parallel results alongside those released by the IEBC. Tallying for personal candidate or party use has been there for a long time and should be allowed to continue.
