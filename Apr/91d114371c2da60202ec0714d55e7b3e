Two herders on Thursday night were assaulted by goons from a rival community at Chardende, Bura North subcounty.Mohamed Mahat and Abdullahi Salat were sleeping when about 25 men stormed their homestead.They drove away 10 cows.Mahat is admitted at the Garissa County Referral Hospital.He sustained deep cuts to the head and back. The men ambushed them at around midnight.&ldquo;We heard commotion, but the attackers were already close. They were armed with pangas, which some used to strike my neck. I dodged and ran for dear life,&rdquo; Mahat said.The attack was prompted by two elders who claim to be the legitimate inhabitants of the land. They visited the homestead in the morning and asked the herders to leave.&ldquo;True to their words, after a few hours they made good their threats by ambushing us,&rdquo; Mahat said.Mahat urged the police to intervene and stop the attacks, saying all Kenyans have the right to live anywhere they wished.&ldquo;We did not provoke anyone. All that brought us here was pasture and water for our livestock after it rained a few days ago,&rdquo; he said.Garissa Supkem secretary Abdullahi Salat said that such cases might recur and cause ethnic conflicts.&ldquo;It is unfortunate for a few elders to hire goons to attack fellow Kenyans. &ldquo;The police should move with speed and apprehend those behind the incident,&rdquo; Salat said.
