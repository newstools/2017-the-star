Mombasa woman representative aspirant Afya Rama has petitioned the Wiper election board to nullify the results of the just-concluded primaries and order a repeat. In a letter dated April 18, she says the party register contained anomalies. She did not concede defeat. Earlier, she said she has evidence that ballot boxes were stuffed in favour of her rival.
