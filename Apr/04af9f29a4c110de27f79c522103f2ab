The selection of Kenya national under-16 boys&rsquo; and girls&rsquo; basketball teams has been postponed to a later date.Kenya Basketball Federation were scheduled to hold the selection yesterday in Nairobi ahead of FIBA Africa Zone V tournament set for June 1- 4 in Mombasa. The other two teams to be constituted are boys&rsquo; under-18 and senior three-on-three (3*3). This showpiece will qualify the top team to Afro-basket competition later in the year. The delay in naming the provisional squads was confirmed by the acting KBF secretary general, Ambrose Kisoi. He said the federation experienced hiccups in reaching out to as many basketball academies as possible.&ldquo;We had not done enough publicity to capture a wider audience (academies) and so KBF thought it wise to give them more time to plan and bring their teams for the selection,&rdquo; said Kisoi, who promised to announce the selection date next week.Kisoi indicated that KBF wants to give opportunities to players from all corners of the country. He is, however, optimistic that the delay will not have impact negatively on the teams&rsquo; preps for the zonal bonanza.
