Senators from pastoralist counties want the Senate and the government to set aside money for residents who have lost property and relatives during security operations.Led by Baringo Senator Gideon Moi, they said residents of Baringo, Laikipia, Samburu and Elgeyo Marakwet counties have lost family members, livestock and property.Gideon noted that all Kenyans deserve to receive money from the government just like groups including miraa farmers."As the government gives Sh1 billion to miraa farmers, we are seeking compensation for our people who have livestock, property and lives," he said.In Laikipia, bandits have invaded private ranches with large herds of cattle in searche for water and pasture amid drought. But claims that the raids are politically motivated have emerged.More on this: Cattle starving to death on Laikipia ranches after herders wreak havocSeveral people have been killed in Baringo during raids by suspected Pokot bandits.Gideon further urged the government to allow pastoralists to graze their livestock in the ADC farms as it was during the Kanu era when Daniel Moi was president."During drought, ADC farms were opened for pastoralists to graze their livestock and they would leave when the rains began. That's what we would like to see," he said.The Senator's sentiments were echoed by others including John Lenyangapuo (West pokot), Sammy Leshore (Samburu) and their Nominated counterparts Zipporah Kittony, Naisula Lesuuda and Paul Njoroge."Hunger has frustrated the people of samburu and they have moved to Laikipia in search of pasture for their livestock but their only sources of livelihood end up killed. Why is the government frustrating pastoralists?" Lenyangapuo said.He urged pastoralists to peacefully wait for the rains and return to their home counties when they start.Samburu woman representative Maison Leshomo said: "[The people must be paid for] all the livestock that has been shot dead and run over by armoured personnel vehicles."IG Joseph Boinnet denied reports that police killed livestock during security operations to rid the area of bandits and illegally acquired weapons.Residents have accused police of brutality but these claims have not been confirmed as police bosses in some areas are not keen on divulging information.Civil Society Groups want the Interior ministry and Boinnet to transfer all security chiefs in the North Rift for being an impediment to ending bandit attacks.More on this: Boinnet urged to transfer North Rift security officers over crimeAlso read: Security forces did not kill cattle in Laikipia - IG Boinnet
