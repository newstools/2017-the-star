Clerics have been urged not to get involved in politics but to preach peace and tolerance. The message was from the Kisumu County Churches Forum on Wednesday. “A cleric who wants to dabble in active politics should strip the collar and individually walk into partisan politics arena and not use the umbrella of the church to articulate personal agenda,” said William Abonyo of New Faith Global Ministry. Philip Obura of Christ Greater Exploits Church said the church should let the political parties do their work. They believe parties have structures to address any rising concerns. “It’s very unfortunate that some of our colleagues can give ultimatums to political parties, as church members we should remain neutral and ensure there is peace within the county,” Obura said. On Monday some religious leaders gave ODM a 24-hour ultimatum to alter the list of officials who will oversee nominations in the county. The two, together with Peter Ojwang’ of New Alfa Church of Christ, and Tom Otieno warned politicians against utterances that might cause violence during the primaries and the general election.
