Police officers will no longer be vetted in public due to &ldquo;serious security concerns&rdquo; posed by the general election.National Police Service Commission chairman Johnston Kavuludi said the ongoing vetting of officers will be conducted in-camera until the election is over.Kenyans have a constitutional right to attend the vetting sessions. &ldquo;As we go towards the election and as the country settles down and focuses on the same, there are certain serious security concerns that may arise in the course of vetting and which might compromise the country&rsquo;s security and that of the officers by the fact of having them vetted in public,&rdquo; he said.Kavuludi spoke at the Embu county police headquarters in Majimbo on Tuesday, where he launched the vetting of 90 traffic officers from the former Eastern province.Neither the press nor the public was allowed into the sessions.In February, Kavuludi barred the media from covering the vetting of police in Nyeri, citing the general election.Yesterday, Kavuludi said the press would be briefed later. He said all the information the press would need, even on an individual officer, will be provided but there will be no live coverage or reporters in the vetting rooms.Kavuludi went to great pains to explain to the press, which was eager to cover the vetting, that the commission will not hide any information.He said the country&rsquo;s security situation is volatile.Kavuludi asked Kenyans and the media to bear with the situation. He asked the press to seek information from the commission&rsquo;s communication officer.Kavuludi urged the media to help the commission net officers found suitable after vetting but who have gone back to their corrupt practices.He said the officers are ruining the image of the National Police Service, which is among the best in the world.Kavuludi asked the media to capture errant officers on camera and forward the tapes to the police. He said the information will be kept confidential. Kavuludi expressed disappointment that rogue officers engage in corruption with abandon, without a care, and in the full view of the public.He said such officers have already been sacked.
