Real estate developers should diversify into mixed-use developments, serviced offices and commercial buildings in the counties from rental apartments to get better returns on their investments, consultants at Cytonn Investments said yesterday. Cytonn Real Estate&rsquo;s annual Nairobi Commercial Office report shows the market is transitioning to a buyer&rsquo;s market, where investors should look into putting up grade A offices in zones with low supply. &ldquo;Investors should consider mixed-use developments as they have been doing significantly better,&rdquo; Cytonn Investments real estate service manager Johnson Denge told a press conference in Nairobi yesterday. &ldquo;We are also yet to see full benefit from devolution, but that is where the opportunity is.&rdquo;He cited Kiambu, Kajiado and Murang&rsquo;a as counties which are in short supply of quality offices. The firm&rsquo;s survey showed that retail space generated a return of about 10 per cent followed by commercial office space (about 9.3 per cent) and residential (about 5.6 per cent). The report shows that in the past year the real estate sector has seen entry of more institutional developers such as Saccos, private equity firms and funds such as Taaleri and Actis and foreign institutions such as AVIC of China. Government initiatives such as digitising of the lands registry, issuing of title deeds as well as waiving of the fees charged by the National Construction Authority, National Environmental Management Authority and a 15 per cent tax cut for large scale developers have lowered the cost of construction. This has encouraged increased investments. &ldquo;We expect continued growth in real estate sector on the back of improved macroeconomic conditions, sustainable high returns, and a changing operational landscape as developers strive to satisfy the high housing deficit,&rdquo; Cytonn chief investments officer Elizabeth Nkukuu said.
