Shocking details of alleged fraud at Chase Bank have emerged in a plaint against former Chairman Zafrullah Khan and 19 other defendants submitted to the Commercial Court in Milimani yesterday by Chase Bank (in Receivership).Khan bought his wife Shehla Khan a vintage Ferrari Dino for USD 455,000 (Sh45,500,000 ) and a limited edition Chevrolet Corvette for $127,551 (Sh12,755,133 ) using Chase Bank funds without passing through a personal account.The bank also bought him an apartment in the Opera Grand residential tower in Dubai, next to the Burj Khalifa, the world&rsquo;s tallest building, at a cost of Sh600 million.Chase Bank also paid $2.1 million (Sh210 million) to AMB Real Estate to build a house for Khan in Michigan, USA.But the plunder went far beyond the acquisition of a few personal assets.The plaint states that Sh7.9 billion of loans and advances to customers were irregularly classified as &lsquo;other assets&rsquo; in the Chase balance sheet; Sh1 billion was irregularly advanced to Khan; Sh6.9 billion was irregularly advanced to companies largely owned by Khan and Chase Group Managing Director Duncan Kabui; Sh8.7 billion in loans and advances to customers; Sh3.1 billion of loans not supported by any documentation; and Sh5.6 billion in overdue interest on loans and advances.In April 2016 the Central Bank put Chase Bank into receivership after it declared a loss of SH686 million for the financial year 2015. Kabui and Khan were dismissed.Chase Bank started imploding last year after Deloitte refused to accept that properties in the names of Khan and others belonged to Chase Bank.When the crisis started at Chase Bank, Khan tried to claim that these companies were Islamic investment vehicles that were owned by him but where Chase bank would get 99 percent of the profits. But the six &lsquo;musharaka&rsquo; agreements supporting his claim were only registered in March 2016, two weeks before the bank went into receivership and long after Deloitte raised the red flag.Veteran banker and financier Khan founded Chase Bank in 1996.Properties worth Sh7.5 billion were paid for by Chase but held in the names of various companies owned by Khan and his associates. However the plaint states that James Mwaura, the Chase Corporate Assets Manager, was &ldquo;only able to verify the purchase price and property costs totalling to Sh1.3 billion&rdquo;.The plaint states, &ldquo;there is no evidence that the Plaintiff (Chase) Board of Directors was made aware of the purported SPV companies and their activities.&rdquo; It said that board members only found when they received an email from a whistleblower in February 2016.The court documents indicate that Sh2,205,642,136 was fraudulently transferred to Khan or companies owned by him and his associates. These included payment of Sh48 million to set up Iman Bank in Somalia; Sh100 million for Rivieres Finance, his equipment leasing company; Sh161 million to Genghis Capital; Sh253 million to Orchid Capital for offshore investments; Sh83 million for IT investments; and a bonus payment of Sh1.05 billion.The bonus payment of Sh1.05 billion was supposed to be paid out to Khan over five years based on performance but was instead collected within six weeks.After Khan became non-executive chairman in 2015, Chase paid him a monthly consultancy fee of $50,466 ( Sh5 million). The bank is now demanding that Khan refund $756,990 ( Sh76 million) that he was paid in consultancy fees.An account in Development Bank of Kenya set up to handle staff loans had discrepancies totaling Sh 1.42 billion.An Sh108 million withdrawal from Development Bank was paid in cash to Carlo van Wagenginen, a shareholder in Chase Bank, to fund his Lake Turkana Wind Project. However Wageningen told investigators the cash was for selling his shares in Chase Bank that he wanted to keep private because of &lsquo;family matters&rsquo;.Kibwezi West MP Patrick Mweu Musimbi received Sh1.358 billion through his two companies Porting Access and Itecs Ltd. The loans are not being repaid for &ldquo;reason of national security&rdquo;.Other big shots are reported to be among the non-performing loan portfolio of Chase Bank but their names have not yet emerged.
