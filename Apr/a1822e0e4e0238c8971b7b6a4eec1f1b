Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga has denied claims he is using county vehicles in campaigns for the August 8 general election.Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo called for the seizure of six Siaya county vehicles, saying the Governor has been using them with their number plates concealed.He said this has been going on with the full knowledge of county security officials. But Rasanga termed the allegations awkward, saying the MP has run out of campaign strategies and is now seeking public sympathy."Those are the kicks of a dying horse; he has realised his competitors in Gem are going to defeat him and has resorted to peddling malice about me," he said.He added: "How does he claim all vehicles in Siaya without number plates belong to the county? The last time I checked, all county vehicles had number plates."The county boss said he only moved around with vehicles to inspect projects for accountability purposes.&ldquo;If Midiwo thinks moving around to inspect county projects with county vehicles is a form of campaigning, he needs to be informed that the official campaign period has not yet begun,&rdquo; Rasanga told the press on Tuesday.Read: Rasanga has failed, Midiwo says, to name choice Siaya governor in DecemberMidiwo had also alleged that Rasanga was using the vehicles to ferry goons and dangerous weapons, and conduct illegal businesses."Why should I move around with goons and dangerous weapons when I have been assigned two official bodyguards by the government?" the Governor said. "Why can't Midiwo report the matter to police?" The politicians have consistently clashed in public in the run up to the elections. In September last year, youths attacked the MP and smashed his vehicle's windows.This was after Midiwo linked the Governor to the controversy around the leasing of Yala swamp to investors.Read: Midiwo accuses Rasanga of pocketing Sh70 million in Yala Swamp lease deal
