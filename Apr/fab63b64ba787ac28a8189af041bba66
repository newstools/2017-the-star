Kiambu Senator Kimani Wamatangi has urged residents to turn out in large numbers and participate in the Jubilee Party primaries.Speaking in Kiambu on Sunday, he said bad leaders are elected by people who do not vote and later complain of poor leadership.&ldquo;Primaries are important. Kiambu is among the counties where the nominations have the fiercest contenders and residents should nominate leaders who will work for them,&rdquo; Wamatangi said. He added, &ldquo;Just as Kiambu led in voter registration, it is only right every voter should also participate in the primaries.&rdquo;
