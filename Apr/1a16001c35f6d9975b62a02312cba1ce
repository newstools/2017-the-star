It is unconstitutional for the court to stop the police from investigating Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho over forgery, the DPP has said.Assistant DPP Alexander Muteti said the police are mandated by the constitution to carry out investigations of any nature."It is unconstitutional to bar investigations especially where there is no evidence of bad faith on the part of authorities," Muteti said.The DPP wants the court to allow investigations to go on and Joho be only absolved from any culpability after the probe is complete."It is not in order for the court to suspend authority of the Inspector General of Police, the Director of Criminal Investigations and DPP."He told the court that the government agencies had been given the above duties by citizens.Muteti further told the court that there was no basis for the orders being sought by Governor Joho."The police are not acting on ulterior motives but are doing their job as stipulated in the constitution," he said.This followed conservatory orders against the police on the probe on the forgery claims against the Mombasa governor.Joho was accused of forging his KCSE result slip but moved to court which issued injunctions against the probe."We want the orders lifted. Joho is only being speculative that all investigations must result in a prosecution."On April 1, judge Eric Ogolla issued interim orders stopping the police from arresting, charging and prosecuting the governor.This was after the governor sued Inspector General Joseph Boinnet of harassing him over the certificates issue.Lawyers James Orengo and Dennis Mosota filed the application under a certificate of urgency.They said the court has powers to question the investigations and stop Joho's prosecution.A ruling on the DPP's application will be made on April 26.Read: Court stops Joho arrest over 'forgery' of papers
