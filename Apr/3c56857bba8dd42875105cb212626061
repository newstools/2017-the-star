Hundreds of youths brought business and transport to a standstill on Tuesday as they celebrated the nomination of Bungoma 'moneybags' Moses Nandalwe.Nandalwe received ODM's ticket to vie for the Sirisia parliamentary seat in the August 8 polls. Incumbent John Waluke who was ODM county chair defected to Jubilee in July last year.Chanting "ODM", "NASA", and "Nandalwe bunge", the youths expressed optimism that Nandalwe will bring "meaningful" change to their constituency."We are happy that our fellow youth has been nominated on a Raila Odinga party [ticket] as the entire Sirisia constituency is an ODM zone," said a man only identified as Ronald from Nasala area."We are going to win. Jubilee here can't win. Waluke must go for betraying baba (Raila) and Sirisia residents," he added.Bungoma 'moneybags' Moses Nandalwe celebrates with his supporters after winning ODM nominations for the Sirisia MP seat, April 19, 2017. /BRIAN OJAMAAIn Kuafu area, Chongoyi and Namwela market, another procession of youths stretched along five kilometres chanted slogans in support of the flamboyant leader."Nandalwe is our MP.
