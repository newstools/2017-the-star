The NASA co-principals&rsquo; three-day retreat in Kilifi to pick a flagbearer will not happen from today as planned. Instead, they will officially receive Chama Cha Mashinani leader Isaac Rutto.The Star was told the principals could not travel to Kilifi yesterday as scheduled because ODM leader Raila Odinga and his ANC counterpart Musalia Mudavadi were not in the country.Raila was in South Africa, while Mudavadi&rsquo;s schedule could not be confirmed. The two were to return last evening. Only Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula and his Wiper counterpart Kalonzo Musyoka were in the country. &ldquo;The principals are receiving a fifth principal tomorrow (today) and definitely the meeting cannot be somewhere in the Coast. Obviously it must be in Nairobi,&rdquo; one of Mudavadi&rsquo;s aides said.Although the co-principals are to pick a joint NASA flagbearer based on a report from an 11-member National Coordinating Committee led by Siaya Senator James Orengo, the Star was told the crucial report &ldquo;is not there&rdquo;. The Orengo NCC team and a five-member Technical Committee headed by Dan Ameyo (ANC) and economist David Ndii were tasked with looking into various options of picking the NASA presidential candidate.The report from the technical committee was to be forwarded to the NCC for further deliberations before being submitted to the co-principals to make a final decision on the flagbearer and running mate.&ldquo;The report is not there. We have not seen it. How can they go for a retreat without a report? What are they going to discuss? The retreat is conditioned on the availability and production of the report. Logistically we are far from a retreat,&rdquo; the aide said.
