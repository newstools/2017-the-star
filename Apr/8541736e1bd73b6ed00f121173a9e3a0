Nakuru residents have linked hate leaflets circulating in the region to aspirants who lost in the just concluded Jubilee primaries.The leaflets warn members of the Kikuyu community to leave the region if incumbent Kinuthis Mbugua is declared governor."Kinuthia Mbugua akitangazwa kama governor Wakikuyu wahame hii town," the Swahili text written in caps reads.The English version is also printed below in caps, reading: "If Kinuthia Mbugua is declared the winner Kikuyus prepare to leave."The leaflets are said to have surfaced immediately after Lee Kinyanjui was declared winner of the Jubilee primaries for the Nakuru governor ticket.They have reportedly been found in Keringet, Muchorwe, Elburgon and Molo towns between Thursday and Saturday.These were among the flash points of the 2007/08 post election violence that left 1,300 dead and more than 600,000 homeless.[VIDEO] NCIC identifies 19 counties at risk of violence in 2017Members of the Kalenjin and Kikuyu communities in the region have, however, rubbished the orchestrated hatred.They said it was a trick by some politicians to divide the two dominant communities for selfish political gains."We want police to swiftly investigate politicians who are in record claiming Kinyanjui belongs to the Kalenjin community and does not deserve the top seat," John Karanja, a resident, said.Bernard Sang, a resident in Muchorwe, said the author of the leaflets wants to create the perception that Kalenjins are against Mbugua."During campaigns, while in Turi, Mbugua said both Lee and his running mate are from one com,unity and do not deserve the vote," he added.Elders have asked residents to ignore the leaflets and asked the communities to work together.Read: Hate leaflets found in Kiambu as primaries kick off amid tight security
