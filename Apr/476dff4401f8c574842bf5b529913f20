President Uhuru Kenyatta on Saturday appeared to endorse Nairobi governor aspirant Peter Kenneth to fly Jubilee&rsquo;s flag.During the burial of former Gatanga MP and current JP deputy chairman David Murathe, the President asked Murang&rsquo;a residents to pray for Kenneth to ensure he wins the Jubilee nominations on Friday.Uhuru spoke at PCEA Kirwara Church, where he eulogised Murathe as hardworking and a man who played a leading role in community development.The President allowed Kenneth to address the crowd. He urged Murang&rsquo;a residents to vote for Uhuru as a bloc to ensure he retains his seat.&ldquo;I will fight to get the ticket and win the seat in Nairobi so that when I come to visit you I will be Nairobi governor,&rdquo; Kenneth said.&ldquo;But I urgeyou to reelect Uhuru as proof of your love for him.&rdquo;Kenneth is facing rivals Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko and Bishop Margaret Wanjiru for the JP ticket.The senator is firm that there will be no consensus for the ticket among the aspirants.Wanjiru is confident she will be nominated as the Jubilee aspirant for the Nairobi governor&rsquo;s seat.&ldquo;The President has made an official statement that the nominations will be free and fair so I want to categorically state that I will not be number two to anyone,&rdquo; she said.Wanjiru dismissed claims that there is division among Jubilee candidates eyeing the seat.&ldquo;There is always healthy competition and as a result weak candidates tend to raise unnecessary fears and anxiety,&rdquo; she said.The former Starehe MP said she intends to stick with Jubilee even if she does not win the nomination, adding that it is the only party with clear ideologies.&ldquo;Those who are praying that I fail at the nominations let them be told that I am in Jubilee to stay,&rdquo; she said. Also present were Cabinet secretaries Eugene Wamalwa (Water and Irrigation) and Mwangi Kiunjuri (Devolution).Others included MPs Jamleck Kamau (Kigumo), Irungu Kang&rsquo;ata (Kiharu), Moses Kuria (Gatundu South) and Murang&rsquo;a county assembly speaker Nduati Kariuki. Meanwhile, the President said he has no preferred candidate in Murang&rsquo;a county where the race is between incumbent Mwangi Wairia and Kigumo MP Jamleck Kamau.&ldquo;I want the people to nominate the best person who will work with me in the next term. All I call for is peace in this electioneering period,&rdquo; Uhuru said.On March 30, Wairia and Kamau resorted to using food as bait to woo voters as the Jubilee Party nominations and general election draw closer.Wairia started a maize seed distribution programme with the aim of reaching at least 220,000 residents. Kamau also started a food distribution programme.
