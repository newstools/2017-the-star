Only opposition leader Raila Odinga can give political direction in Nyanza, aspirant Carey Orege has said.He said Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo should not try to offer political blessings in the Siaya governor race. Orege warned Midiwo against endorsing aspirants. The Siaya governor race is so dynamic that one leader cannot purport to singlehandedly dictate who will be governor, he said.Orege said it&rsquo;s regrettable to see leaders forming cocoons to mislead voters that they are in the winning camp. The Siaya governor hopeful attended a media breakfast meeting in Bondo, where he expressed confidence in winning the April 13 primaries. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not bad to be in camps but don&rsquo;t mislead voters that you have the power to decide who will be the next governor. Let the race be fair, and the best player win,&rdquo; Orege said. He said leaders like Siaya Senator James Orengo have more weight in county politics than Midiwo, who only enjoys Gem support. Midiwo endorsed businessman William Oduol but after they had fallen out, he resorted to backing Rarieda MP Nicholas Gumbo as his preferred governor aspirant. Midiwo has been campaigning for Gumbo in Siaya, a move that has not augured well with Orege.
