Some time ago as I approached the stream-crossing area, a flash of colour caught my eye. There next to a small bush were two magnificent saddle-billed storks. They were undoubtedly on &ldquo;honeymoon&rdquo; and the male was flapping his wings and really trying to show off to this &ldquo;lady&rdquo;, but the female in typical fashion showed very little interest and kept turning away. The male became increasingly frustrated and increased his efforts, and eventually after about 30 minutes, the female accepted him. I could not help but think that some human romantic efforts have similar traits, but hopefully a little more sophisticated and subtle.Then last week I saw two saddle-billed storks had returned to the park. I hope they are the same pair I have been seeing in recent years. To me, they are the most magnificent of all stork species. To actually see a saddle-bill in the wild is always a thrill, as they are large, impressive and colourful. In many parts of Africa, these storks are very rare, so to actually have them attempting to breed in the Nairobi National Park is wonderful.I know of some people who visit the park for the prime purpose of going on a &ldquo;birding safari&rdquo;. There are estimated to be over 550 species to see at various times of the year; many are permanent residents, while other bird species are migrants. It is good to stop at a rest site or just switch off the car engine and listen to the incredible variety of bird songs that God has created; it is very calming and helps relieve stress. In my experience, while &ldquo;bird watching&rdquo;, other species such as lion, buffalo, rhino, and so on, do at times &ldquo;get in the way!"The park is open daily from 06h00 to 19h00.For more information on the park, you can link to the following websites: www.kws.org or www.nairobigreenline.org or on Facebook.
