What is going on at Kenya Airways? We are told that the people running the airline are strategically placing people in positions before the new CEO takes over office. It is not clear whether chairman Michael Joseph is aware of the changes, some that may undermine his effort to turn around the airline. Those in the know tell us that some positions have been filled without being advertised and their jobs are similar to the ones their juniors are holding. The fear by those making the decisions, we are told, is that the new CEO is likely to be a mzungu because four of them have been shortlisted to take over from Mbuvi Ngunze. That may complicate things for them.================A senior ODM member was overheard laughing off the ongoing probe into the conduct of some party members accused of fanning violence in the ongoing nomination campaigns. The flamboyant politician thumped his chest sarcastically, deriding the committee's work immediately he walked out of the grilling room. Our small bird heard the political heavyweight tell one of his handlers that the session was just a waste of time.================A Jubilee broker from Nyanza got a taste of his own medicine after some top party officials quashed his bid to meet the President for a brief on the ongoing Jubilee campaigns in Nyanza. The operative, who reportedly fell out with top officials at the Jubilee secretariat, is accused of leaking sensitive party information communicated from the secretariat to the grassroots offices to the opposition coalition NASA. At a small meeting with a senior Jubilee officials at a top hotel in Nairobi, the Nyanza operative was shocked when he was told he will never be allowed near the President and that Jubilee doesn't recognise officials from Luo Nyanza because the party has no support there.=============Some aspirants for the Garissa Township MP seat have been missing in action for the last two months. While Wiper deputy party leader Farah Maalim was touted as the best bet to oust incumbent National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale, the former House Deputy Speaker is nowhere in the campaign trail, barely four months to the polls. Duale was overheard last week bragging that he doesn't fear Maalim or any other opponent. "I have never seen my opponents on the ground. Every time I am there they literally take off," Duale said.===============Is it a coincident or is it that Ahadi Kenya Trust boss Dr Stanley Kamau is working on collecting crucial intelligence briefs for the government? Every time the man visits a county with food, shoes and other goodies for the vulnerable, the President follows hot on his heels to campaign. This was the case in Turkana, Samburu, Isiolo, Kwale and last week Wajir. We overheard that whenever the NGO boss visits a region, he gives 'gifts' to youth and women's groups.==============
