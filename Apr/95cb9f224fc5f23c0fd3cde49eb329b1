Morgan Heritage is one of the recognised reggae and multi-award winning groups in the world.Word Is sat with Peetah and Mojo from the group, who opened up about relocating to Kenya. The two said they love the country and any time from now, they will be bringing their families for their next visit.They further revealed that their brother, Gramps Morgan, has a farm in Naivasha, which he is already working on.&ldquo;Kenya has become one of our homes, so there are three places in the world we call home: Jamaica, America and now Kenya. We will bring our families here, in the very near future,&rdquo; they said.When asked what they loved about the country, the two revealed that its beautiful sites are almost similar to Jamaica.&ldquo;We like the high mountain regions and the altitude is very beautiful. Kenya reminds us of Jamaica. I feel like am in Jamaica everywhere I go. And we are used to a multi-cultural environment and Kenya has that.&rdquo;Since the group is from a country where marijuana is legalised, we thought it was wise to ask the Grammy award winners about the petition for its legalisation in Kenya.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s great, there is a lot of medicinal benefits to marijuana. I&rsquo;ve never seen marijuana kill nobody.&rdquo;Mojo added that weed increases pleasure and &ldquo;you stay calm to mellow your vibe&rdquo;.
