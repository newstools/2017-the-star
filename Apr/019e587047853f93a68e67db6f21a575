The winner of the Wiper ticket for Kitui governor should be known today after hotly contested nomination campaigns.Leader Kalonzo Musyoka&rsquo;s close allies &mdash; Senator David Musila and incumbent Julius Malombe &mdash; are in cut-throat competition for the party ticket.Their feud is long-standing.Kalonzo appealed to Musila to shelve his governor ambitions in favour of Malombe, to ensure party unity.But Musila defied him, told him to worry about the presidential ticket and his own future.Musila says he&rsquo;s the better candidate.On Friday, he told the Star there has been no consensus, residents will decide which of them flies the Wiper flag on August 8 in the General Election.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m busy campaigning. How can there be any consensus when we are all campaigning?&rdquo; Musila said.Another heavyweight in the contest is former Lands CS Charity Ngilu of Narc.Whoever clinches the Wiper ticket, will be running against Ngilu. Musila and Ngilu both ran for Senate in 2013.Musila was endorsed by nine MPs, including woman representative Nyiva Mwendwa and rebels who ditched Wiper for Jubilee.Mwingi Central MP Joe Mutambu on Friday said he supports Musila to remove Malombe from office because the incumbent has &ldquo;misused funds and made the county lag behind in development&rdquo;.Mwingi North MP John Munuve said on the phone, &ldquo;Malombe has only built a seven-kilometre rough road leading to his witch doctor in a remote place. It only serves a few.&rdquo; Malombe defends his record and says the accusations are untrue,
