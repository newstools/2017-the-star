Some senators abandoning the Upper House to run for other elective posts have cited intimidation and frustration by MPs.The Senate lacks muscle in its oversight mandate. It has had a prolonged supremacy war with the National Assembly with MPs making key decisions on budgetary allocations and laws.The Senate has faced a myriad of challenges with some Kenyans questioning its role, while MPs demand it be scrapped.Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale said, &ldquo;It is a fact that under the current configuration of the Constitution, the Senate does not have the prerequisite muscle to protect devolution. The Constitution must be reviewed to empower it.&rdquo; He will run for governor against incumbent Wycliffe Oparanya.Senators&rsquo; first attempt to amend the Constitution through a referendum was in August 2013, but it failed.In June 2015, they formed a Select Committee chaired by Senator Kipchumba Murkomen (Elgeyo Marakwet) to push for a referendum before the election, but the initiative collapsed. Senators were angry with MPs&rsquo; move to slash their budgetary allocation to the counties in addition to being denied Sh1 billion to facilitate the oversight of county governments.Senate Deputy Speaker Kembi Gitura (Murang&rsquo;a) said efforts should be made to strengthen the House. He said, &ldquo;I hope they are not leaving to join the gravity of misappropriation of public funds we have seen in many county governments. I hope they are leaving because they have seen the potential of devolution and how much it has been abused by governors during the first term.&rdquo; Gitura will defend his seat. More than 16 senators want to unseat governors, while about 10 are running for MP.
