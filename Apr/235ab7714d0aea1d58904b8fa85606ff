The hearing of a corruption case against Garissa Governor Nathif Jama was on Friday pushed to May 18 after two key prosecution witnesses failed to turn up.The case was adjourned a fortnight ago after defence lawyer Issa Nasoor told the court he had another case in Nairobi that required his presence.Prosecution counsel Omondi Opondo and Gitonga Riungu told the court one of their key witnesses was away on official duty in Nairobi. They applied for a witness summons in the next hearing.Nasoor protested failure of witnesses to appear in court, saying this has greatly inconvenienced the proceedings and hurt the rights of the accused.They said the prosecution could have made a &ldquo;simple phone call&rdquo; if they knew the witnesses would not turn up.Senior magistrate Cosmas Maundu postponed the case after receiving submissions from the prosecution and the defence lawyer.Governor Jama and six former Tender Committee members, Rahma Dekow, Jawahir Keinan, Abdi Sahal, Safia Mohamed, Mohamed Hassan and Mohamud Hassan were present.They are accused of failing to comply with procurement procedures in a contract with the Kenya Red Cross Society&rsquo;s Emergency Plus to provide seven ambulances in 2014.Kenya Red Cross Society secretary general Abbas Gullet, former Finance executive Idriss Muktar and former Director of Medical Services Abey Sheikh have testified.Former EACC regional head Abraham Kemboi is yet to testify.Earlier, Gullet said he had no direct role to play in the contract between the Emergency Medical Services and the Garissa government. &ldquo;My role as the chairman was to oversight,&rdquo; he said.Gullet said the EMS is an independent entity and runs its own day-to-day activities.
