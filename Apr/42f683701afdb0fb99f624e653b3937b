The cigarette smoking chimpanzee rescued from Iraq and quarantined in Laikipia has now been freed from solitary confinement. Manno was confined for four months in a cage at Sweetwaters Chimpanzee Sanctuary, Ol Pejeta, as he was tested for disease. Veterinarians were worried he could be carrying ebola from his original home in Central Africa.Kenya Wildlife Service chief veterinarian Dr Edward Kariuki gave Manno a clean bill of health early last week. Caretaker Stephen Mukundi said, &ldquo;He was so happy when he stepped out of his crate into his new home.&rdquo; Ol Pejeta said Manno will gradually be allowed to mix with other chimps at the conservancy. &ldquo;Snatched from his mother at a young age, Manno cannot remember what another chimpanzees sound like, let alone how they look, or how he should behave around them,&rdquo; the conservancy said. &ldquo;His pen is 20m away from the others, so he will be able to watch other chimpanzees, maybe even talk to them, without any physical interaction. This is for his safety and mental wellbeing &mdash; chimpanzees can be aggressive and unpredictable, and we do not want to overwhelm Manno or put him in any danger.&rdquo; Manno was smuggled from Central Africa and taken to a zoo in Dohuk, Iraq, where he spent miserable days smoking cigarettes to impress visitors who would then dole out food.He was relocated with help from several conservation groups who spent Sh1 million to get him out of Iraq.
