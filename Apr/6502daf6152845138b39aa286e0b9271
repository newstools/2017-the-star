Narok Governor Samuel Tunai has been accused of instigating the storming of Chama Cha Mashinani rallies at Sagamian and Sogoo trading centres in Narok South constituency by Jubilee supporters at the weekend.Several people were injured in the fracas after youths stormed the CCM meetings and started distributing Jubilee branded campaign materials, leading to a fight.The fight happened before the arrival of CCM party leader Isaac Rutto, Emurua Dikirr MP Johana Ng&rsquo;eno and his Narok West counterpart Patrick ole Ntutu.The leaders called on the National Cohesion and Integration Commission, chaired by Francis ole Kaparo, the IEBC, the Directorate of Criminal Investigations and the county commissioner to investigate.Rutto (pictured) said ward administrators were used to coordinate the distribution of Jubilee T-shirts, caps, fliers and assortment of campaign merchandise. &ldquo;Leaders should preach peace and coexistence on the campaign trail and avoid setting their supporters against those of their opponents. We should only compete and differ ideologically and shun violence,&rdquo; he said.Rutto wondered why Tunai is fighting him and yet he is the one who introduced Tunai to Kalenjin elders and youths and appealed to them to back him for governor in 2013. &ldquo;For Tunai to be acceptable by both communities and bolster the chances of winning the election, we went to the extent of giving him a running mate,&rdquo; he said.
