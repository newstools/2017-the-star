A viral video that captured the extrajudicial killing of two suspected gang members in Eastleigh, Nairobi, on Friday, has outraged Kenyans.It is alleged that the dead suspects were members of the notorious Super Power Gang and were about to commit a robbery.The gang is among more than 90 groups outlawed in a gazette notice by Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery in December last year.The father of one of the young men shot in the incident acknowledged that his son was actually a thug and pleaded with the government to release his body.&ldquo;He was not one to use knives or guns. He was just a thief of going into people's pockets and such things," he told journalists at his home.There were mixed reactions by Kenyans online with some of them supporting the police for killing the gang members.The incident is the latest of a series of shootings that have painted Kenyan police a trigger-happy, ready to kill even unarmed suspects who have already surrendered.Just yesterday, Presidential spokesman Manoah Esipisu confirmed the killing of on an intruder in State House grounds a week ago.He however declined to divulge details, saying only the matter was being handled by the security apparatus and that the man was not even close to the main State House building, contrary to media reports.On the Eastleigh incident, even as Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet ordered a probe, human rights activists condemned the killings and called for the police officers to be brought to book."I have seen the video and I condemn those actions. Investigations have already started and I can assure you action will be taken against the officers involved," Boinett said.Police spokesperson Charles Owino said those in the video must be identified for a probe to happen."The important thing is the person must be identified whether they are policemen or not," he told the Star on phone.He added: "In the police service we don&rsquo;t take collective responsibility because a policeman makes his/her own decision. We will be able to make a decision after a conclusive probe.&rdquo;On Saturday, the Independent Policing Oversight Authority dispatched its Rapid Response Unit to investigate the incident with a view to establishing the circumstances of the shooting."If there is culpability, we&rsquo;ll ensure those responsible face the full force of the law. Upon conclusion, the Authority will make recommendations and forward the investigation file to the ODPP for his attention," Ipoa said.The minute-long clip that surfaced on Friday shows a person alleged to be a plainclothes policeman apprehending a suspect.The body of another suspect lies in the middle of the road, covered in blood.Another man in police uniform holding what looks like an AK-47 rifle is seen dispersing the crowd.When the suspect tries to struggle with the alleged plainclothes officer, he is shot at close range and four more gunshots are heard as the camera moves away.When the camera focusses back on the scene, the plainclothesman is seen standing over the suspect and asks his colleague for a pistol, then shoots the suspect below him at point blank range.Five gunshots are heard.The man said to be a cop reloads the gun, then shoots the suspect who is still lying on his stomach.The Independent Medico-Legal Unit condemned the incident and asked Ipoa to probe alleged police involvement.&ldquo;A uniformed police officer in jungle jacket pushes the crowd back as the execution happens, seeming to indicate that the executioner might be a police officer,&rdquo; the organisation noted in a statement.Former Chief Justice Willy Mutunga was among those who faulted the police most for extrajudicial killings.&ldquo;If the police had this evidence they should have arrested them and charged them in our courts. Extrajudicial killings are criminal," he said.But Nairobi Police Commander Japheth Koome told the Star on Saturday that the video "was acted"."It is not true. It was acted. It is not true, it did not happen. Imepigwa picha sehemu moja tu (It was only shot in one place). It is not true," Koome said.Koome said the &ldquo;acted out video&rdquo; was meant to discourage him from making sure people are safe in Nairobi."Whether those people act to discourage me ... I am even more motivated and I have no regret," Koome said.Koome said he will be ruthless to the "criminals" and asked them to surrender their guns."I am ruthless. I do not talk much, but I am ruthless ... but one thing everybody needs to know is that I will deal with the criminals. We are not going to give the criminals any chance ... I am currently burying a cop killed by a gangster in Meru," he said.Kibra MP Ken Okoth, who is also a member of a parliamentary caucus on Human Rights, said that all Kenyans who believe in the rule of law must condemn in the strongest terms the continued existence of elements in the police force that act as execution squads.&ldquo;The young boys in poor communities like Kibra and Mathare are targets of extrajudicial killings, yet major looters of public funds and corruption masterminds go scot-free," Okoth said.He went on: &ldquo;Poverty has been criminalised and is punishable by death without trial. The rest of society may feel immune for now as the poor suffer, but the rogue squads will one day make the rich their victims too."Okoth also said that it is high time for all MPs to support the Prevention of Torture Bill that will tackle cases state agents committing acts of torture and assorted human rights violations.&ldquo;The office of the Attorney General, [Majority Leader] Duale, the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights and stakeholders in civil society all support the Prevention of Torture Bill. Parliament must rush to pass it for President Uhuru&rsquo;s signature as soon as possible," he said.The Bill criminalises all forms of torture and human rights abuses. It demands Kenya implement the UN Convention Against Torture, Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment of any wrongdoer by police in obtaining information.ODM Treasurer Timothy Bosire hit at the Jubilee government, accusing it of sanctioning extrajudicial killings ahead of the August 8 polls.&ldquo;What happened should be condemned in the strongest terms possible, somebody who has surrendered and been arrested cannot be killed even at the battlefront, getting hold of someone&rsquo;s hands and then you decide to shoot him is unheard of," the Kitutu Masaba MP said.The incident in Eastleigh however looks like a deal gone bad between the gang and police elements, if previous reports are anything to go by.According to an article published by the Nairobi Law Monthly in November last year Super Power is almost entirely made up of young boys.Together with Gaza of Kayole and 40 Brothers based in Eastlands, the police have ranked them the top three most dangerous criminal gangs in the country in 2016.The Super Power gang's criminal activities range from pick pocketing and mugging to violent robbery and murder, often stabbing their victims.Residents say that this gang was initially supported by businessmen in the area for protection from rival businessmen, but this changed after the group turned into a quasi-terrorist organisation.In the NLM article, one leader of the gang talked of how they work with their police "friends" but singled out one Ahmed Rashid, who it is claimed was involved in the latest killing.&ldquo;He shoots at the slightest provocation, or if you defy his order. If he arrests you, your family will have to part with a lot of money to get you out," the gang leader, only identified as Jamal by the writer, said.Jamal claimed that they have been working with police to pull off some of the greatest heists in Eastleigh, something that is corroborated by Eastleigh residents in the story.
