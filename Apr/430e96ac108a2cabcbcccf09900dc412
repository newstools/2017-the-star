West Pokot woman representative Regina Nyeris has urged the state to build more rescue centres to enable girls from the pastoralist communities be educated without interference.She said many girls from the Pokot community drop out of school due to retrogressive cultures. &ldquo;It is unconstitutional to expose our girls to FGM. Those who are still practicing it secretly will be arrested and prosecuted,&rdquo; Nyeris said. She spoke at Nasokol Primary School on Saturday. Nyeris said she is optimistic early marriages and FGM will be eradicated. &ldquo;If we come together as stakeholders, we will fight these vices,&rdquo; Nyeris said.
