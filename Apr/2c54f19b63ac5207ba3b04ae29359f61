MCAs will earn a salary until their five-year term expires in March 2018, a court has ruled.This means the current MCAs will draw a salary without working.High Court Judge Edward Muriithi, in a decision read on his behalf by Justice Chacha Mwita, however declined to change the election date for governors and MCAs to March 5, 2018 as sought.He said, &ldquo;For avoidance of doubt, this judgment does not affect the holding of the General Election scheduled for August 8, 2017, and the payment of salaries and other applicable emoluments will be per month in arrears at the end of every month for the period of eight months by which the tenure of the MCAs has been reduced.&rdquo;Muriithi said under the law, the five-year term for current MCAs comes to an end in March, so they are entitled to a salary until that time.Though the decision may make the public feel aggrieved, he said, the rights accrued under the Constitution must be upheld.&ldquo;The MCAs suffer a reduced opportunity to remain in office for the full term of their constitutional tenure consistently with their right to hold office under Article 38( 2 ) of the Constitution, and for that reason, they are entitled to compensation for the lost income for the period,&rdquo; the judge said.Muriithi also said there is a need for amendment of the law to align the tenure of MCAs with that of MPs to remove the liability to pay the MCAs for the remainder of their terms.He made the judgment in a case filed by Andrew Sang, the County Assembly Forum and Richard Ouma.The MCAs had said the decision by the IEBC to announce the election will be held on August 8 reduces their term by eight months.They further said that unlike the MPs, their term was set at five years by Section 177 of the Constitution.They argued there is a conflict between two sections of the Constitution - Section 177 ( 1 ) (a), which provides the election of MCAs be held on the same date as that of MPs, and Section 177 ( 4 ), which sets the term of MCAs at five years.They wanted the two sections harmonised and the election date for MCAs slated for March 4, 2018, not August 8, 2017.The IEBC said the court lacks jurisdiction to deal with the issue.
