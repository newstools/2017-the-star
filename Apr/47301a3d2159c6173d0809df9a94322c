KPMG has written to government agencies to get certified records of Kenyans to facilitate the audit of the voter register.Yesterday, the firm said the successful and timely conclusion of the process will depend on the provision of the required documents by various agencies.KPMG is looking for certified copies of the 2013 voter register, list of those enrolled in registration exercises since 2013 and the register of persons.In addition, it is seeking the national passports register, the register of births and deaths, lists of IDs surrendered by reason of death and the Housing and Population Census, 2009.&ldquo;We have commenced engagement with key stakeholders to share our methodology and approach, expected outcomes and to address issues they may have,&rdquo; CEO Josphat Mwaura said.&ldquo;We will continue to respond to any legitimate issues raised by Kenyans and other stakeholders to ensure there is broad understanding of the process of the audit and ownership of the outcome.&rdquo;According to the law, a credible Register of Voters must be available for verification by the electorate, at least 90 days before the elections. The IEBC said the verification of the register will run for 30 days from May 10 to June 9.&ldquo;Time is not only of the essence but critical. Given the late commencement of the audit, we are now racing against time,&rdquo; Mwaura said.KPMG says the methodology includes review of the legal framework, systems and processes underlying the registration process and the register of voters.The audit seeks to confirm &ldquo;accuracy, completeness, validity of data, and to identify any exceptions that require confirmation, correction or deletion.&rdquo;It will also involve a review of the register of voters against the certified data on national IDs and national passports register to confirm that those registers are bona fide citizens of Kenya.The audit will also review the register against the register of deaths to ensure that dead voters are removed; and also against the register of births to ensure no underage person has been registered.KPMG will also review the biometric data to confirm completeness and eliminate duplication. At the end of the process, KPMG will give a report to the IEBC that has three key components:1. Recommendations to enhance the accuracy of the registers, thus ensuring a clean register;2. The specific exceptions identified and the recommended actions to address those exceptions; and3. Report of the legal, systems and process improvement required to secure the integrity and security of the register.
