Eastleigh traders and residents yesterday defended the alleged police officers caught on camera killing two suspected gangsters, eliciting condemnation from human rights&rsquo; groups.The majority of traders who spoke to the Star said although extrajudicial killing is illegal, it is necessary if it is the only option. They said this will help police to protect innocent and hardworking Kenyans. They said parading them and killing them publicly could serve as a warning to other criminals.Residents claimed the two were part of a gang that has been stealing from traders, customers and residents.A security guard, who did not want to be named, at an adjacent mall to where the two were killed said they have been pick-pocketing during the day, mainly snatching mobile phones and handbags in crowded places, but they turn into violent criminals at night. &ldquo;My concern is not the killing of the thugs, but why police had unduly delayed their deaths for too long,&rdquo; the security guard said.&ldquo;It is disrespectful for their parents to claim they were petty thieves, as if they had a right to steal from others. Everyday at dawn and in the evening, they armed themselves to waylay pedestrians and rob them, sometimes seriously wounding some.&rdquo;Porter Peter Mutwiri said the &ldquo;officers&rsquo; should be rewarded for public execution of the two. He accused parents of the slain suspects of mocking victims of robbery.&ldquo;Is it fair for the parents to claim their children are petty criminals? If I spend the whole day carrying luggage for traders on my back to earn Sh500 then get robbed of everything, who between me and the parents of those criminals should feel sad?&rdquo; Mutwiri asked.Businessman Abdi Hussein said the two had robbed a woman in broad daylight before police trailed and caught up with them.Hussein said three of them had accosted a woman whom they mugged.&ldquo;It [the execution] looks inhumane to those who saw the killings on the video, but have they seen what the gangsters do to their victims at dawn?&rdquo; he asked.The Directorate of Criminal Investigations&rsquo; Homicide Division officers declined to divulge details of the probe.They said information about it can only be shared by DCI director Ndegwa Muhoro or police spokesman Charles Owino. Owino was not at his Vigilance House office and did not answer calls.
