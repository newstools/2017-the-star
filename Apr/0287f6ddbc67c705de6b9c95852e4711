Former Cherangany MP Joshua Kuttuny has been advised to go slow in his bid for the seat.Last week, Kuttuny apologised to the residents for mistakes he made that made him lose in 2013.Addressing the media yesterday in Kitale, JP aspirant Julius Tunduria said it is unwise for Kuttuny to ask for forgiveness and votes at the same time.&ldquo;Let him first ask for forgiveness and give residents time to forgive him before declaring his interest to run. He should instead back one of the candidates in the (Jubilee) party,&rdquo; he said.Tunduria told Kuttuny is not a playground.It has been said Kuttuny lost his reelection bid in 2013 because of his abusive language - towards residents and aspirants - and discrimination of some ethnic groups.Tunduria said both Kuttuny and the incumbent MP failed to complete projects. &ldquo;We have a series of unfinished school projects in Cherangany. Why should one start constructing schools a kilometre apart and leave them half done,&rdquo; he said.
