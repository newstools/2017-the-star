Karachuonyo MP James Rege has shelved his third term reelection to campaign for President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s second term.He was appointed by Jubilee leadership to head the campaign team in the Nyanza and Western counties.Speaking to the Star on the phone on Sunday, Rege said he is committed to deliver votes to Jubilee in the opposition stronghold region.He said he changed his mind after he met Uhuru in Kisumu last week during the National Drama Festivals.&ldquo;I will try my best and sell Jubilee&rsquo;s good agenda to the people. I believe we will win their hearts and form government together,&rdquo; Rege said.Last week, Rege told journalists he will defend his seat as an independent candidate.The legislator was elected on the ODM ticket in 2007 and 2013, but broke ranks with the party leadership. Rege openly campaigned for Philip Okundi of Maendeleo Democratic Party against Moses Kajwang&rsquo; (ODM) during the Homa Bay senatorial by-election on February 12, 2015. &ldquo;My differences with ODM were based on ideology. ODM could not practise the democracy it preaches,&rdquo; he said.
