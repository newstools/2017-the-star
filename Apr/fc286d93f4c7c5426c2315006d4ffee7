A businessman who has unsuccessfully run for North Imenti MP three times will try his luck again. Paul Murunga said, &ldquo;It has been hard. Locals get confused with all manner of aspirants and it is about time they get the kind of leader they need.&rdquo; He said North Imenti has lagged and he will do a better job. Murunga spoke to the Star in Meru yesterday. &ldquo;Even in education, the school that trails in the country is in North Imenti. If I&rsquo;m elected, I will improve the sector by motivating teachers and building more amenities,&rdquo; he said.
