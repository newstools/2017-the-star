More than 19 million Kenyans are listed as voters, the IEBC has reported after generating the first draft of the register.The draft followed the completion of an audit to strike out duplicate entries.Chairman Wafula Chebukati placed the number at 19,530,312. He said the commission analysed all BVR databases to ensure only one record per voter."This number is likely to change due to the ongoing quality assurance process both in the field and at the headquarters," he said.Chebukati told journalists in Nairobi on Wednesday that the commission had begun auditing the register. Audit firm KMPG is undertaking the exercise."The audit shall [take] 21 days with effect from March 31. We appeal to all actors to support this process."The chairman said IEBC will fulfill all legal requirements following the vacation of court orders that suspended sections of Elections Act, 2011.The orders temporarily stopped the electoral agency from awarding tenders for the register's audit.Read: Jubilee carries day as Senate votes to adopt amendments to election lawsAlso read: KPMG starts voters register audit, asks state agencies for key documentsChebukati said the first batch of elections equipment - Kenya Integrated Elections Management System - by Safran should have been delivered by mid April.He said the French firm will deliver all the 45,000 kits in time for testing and certification, 60 days before the election, as required by law."Once the commission receives the kits, it will hold a public exhibition to show how the new system works," he said.IEBC settled for Safran after the cancellation of a tender previously awarded to French firm Gemalto SA.Chebukati said the only technically evaluated bidder quoted a price of Sh5.2 billion against the available budget of Sh3.8 billion.Taking into account the remaining processes of tender procurement, manufacture, delivery, installation and commissioning, he said it would have been impossible to meet operational and legal timelines.Read more: IEBC settles for Safran for poll equipment, says deadlines must be metChebukati maintained that under the law, only the commission is allowed to count, tally, collate, announce and declare the results of an election.This was in response to a plan by the opposition NASA to create a parallel poll tallying system.Raila Odinga, a NASA co-principal, said no law bars them from proceeding with the plan.But the electoral agency boss said they developed a results management framework to ensure transparency and accountability of the election results."In the next few weeks, we will begin our voter education programmes focusing on the results management framework," he said.The commission boss added that so far, only 57 out of 67 registered political parties have submitted their membership lists.He said no party will be allowed to conduct primaries without submitting the list and names of candidates.All parties are expected to have concluded their primaries by April 26, 2017.
