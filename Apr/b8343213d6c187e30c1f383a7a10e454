Embu Senator Lenny Kivuti‘s running mate in the race for governor has denied being bribed with millions of shillings to take up the post. Emilio Kathuri (pictured), a former Manyatta MP, said he agreed to work with Kivuti because “he is an achiever.” He spoke at the ACK Kiangima Hall yesterday. Kivuti was present. “I was not compromised,” he said.
