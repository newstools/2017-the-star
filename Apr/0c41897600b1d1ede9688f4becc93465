When I wake up, I&rsquo;m not in the car. I&rsquo;m in a bare room on a small mattress with no covers. Where am I? I start to panic. What&rsquo;s going on? My bag is on the floor and I grab it, trying to find my phone. It&rsquo;s not in there. Neither is my wallet. Just some lipstick and a book I have been reading. As the alcoholic haze of the night before starts to fade, bits and pieces start coming back to me. Mr N. Nabil. A restaurant. Lots of alcohol. Nabil&rsquo;s brother has my phone. I remember he took it to charge it and never gave it back. Safekeeping, he called it when we were leaving. Then I passed out in the car. I don&rsquo;t remember anything else. I have no idea where I am. The floor is dirty, the room is musty and the door is locked. There's a small window but it&rsquo;s very high up and I can&rsquo;t reach it.I start to bang on the door. There must be someone here. Someone will hear me.&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo; I shout. &ldquo;Nabil? Let me out!&rdquo;I bang some more. &ldquo;Nabil?&rdquo;As the minutes pass, I get more desperate.&ldquo;Nabil! This is NOT funny! LET ME OUT!!!&rdquo;There&rsquo;s no response. Tears well in my eyes and fear grips me in a way I&rsquo;ve never known. I have no clue where I am. No phone. No one knows I&rsquo;m with Nabil except Mr N. Wait, yes, oh, thank God. Mr N will find me. He&rsquo;ll be worried when he doesn&rsquo;t hear from me. It will be okay.That thought calms me down a little. Mr N. Yes! Let me hang on to that. He knew I was going home with this guy. I&rsquo;m so thirsty! Damn! My mouth is dry. I have a headache. I feel dizzy and light-headed. And I&rsquo;m so freaking tired. I drag my tired feet back to mattress. Collapse on it and fall asleep. The next time I wake up there is natural light in the room. Sunrays are filtering through the tiny window. It was not a dream. I&rsquo;m still here. Someone has been in the room. There is a tray with a plastic cup of water and a slice of bread. I stand up and immediately get hit by a massive a wave of dizziness. My heart rate has increased. I need water! I make it to the tray and drink from the small cup. It&rsquo;s not enough. I check the door. It&rsquo;s still locked. Why are they doing this? &ldquo;I need water!&rdquo; I shout. &ldquo;Please, give me water&hellip;&rdquo;There&rsquo;s no sound from the other side. I have sobered up now, fear the perfect inducement. What went wrong? I look back at the evening. Everything that was said last night that I ignored starts to feel ominous with hindsight.&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your biggest regret?&rdquo; I remember Nabil asking me.I didn&rsquo;t know what to say. My biggest regret? I had no idea. Everything I had done so far had worked out pretty well for me. I told him I regretted my career choice in university.&ldquo;I think there will be bigger regrets than that,&rdquo; he had said. I remember asking him what he meant by that and him not answering. I remember his brother taking my phone. I remember all the questions about who knew about where I was. I remember him wanting to know if I lived alone. He was setting this up all along and wanted to be sure I wouldn&rsquo;t be missed. But surely, Mr N is his friend. How will he explain my disappearance to him? Will he say that I stormed off and took a taxi? Will Mr N believe that? I have to hope and pray he doesn&rsquo;t. He&rsquo;s the only person who knows I&rsquo;m with this guy.
