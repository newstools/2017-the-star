Monitor your children on holidays, Garissa subcounty commissioner Hiddi Galgallo has urged parents.Primary and secondary schools closed on April 7 and will reopen early next month. Speaking in Bula College on Thursday, he said it is the responsibility of parents to know who their children associate with to keep them from falling into bad company. &ldquo;Teenage children are easily lured by friends into engaging in anti-social behaviour and petty crimes because of peer pressure,&rdquo; he said.Galgallo said parents should ensure their children are not idle, noting that offences by juveniles as young as 15 are on the rise. He said gangs are using schoolchildren to commit crimes.The state official said a gang is probably behind the increasing cases of handbag thefts from women in Garissa town.Galgallo said police will deal firmly with culprits. He said security personnel have identified residents and non-residents are involved in muggings.&ldquo;I am appealing to the parents to help us maintain security by looking after your kids. Report to police if you suspect he has joined bad company, so we can take action,&rdquo; he said.On Sunday, Garissa Township MP Aden Duale urged police to swiftly arrest those behind the crimes.Three weeks ago, a handbag thief was stoned to death in broad daylight, his body dragged around town.The grisly lynching was filmed and posted online as a warning.
