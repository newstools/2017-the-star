A woman who had evaded taking a plea since January was arrested yesterday and charged in a Kiambu court. Keziah Wangui denied using fake SGR tenders to defraud unsuspecting people. She had claimed she was hospitalised but an arrest warrant was issued after the defence counsel failed to produce hospital documents. The magistrate lifted the arrest warrant and released her on Sh200,000 bail or Sh500,000 bond. The hearing was set for June 13.
