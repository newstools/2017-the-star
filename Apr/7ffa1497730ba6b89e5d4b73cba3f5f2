Almost eight out of 10 women have faked an orgasm, according to new research.And when psychologists carried out their study, they found there were a staggering 143 reasons given for faking it &ndash; ranging from being bored to practising acting skills.More than one in three women said they faked it because they thought they were expected to &ndash; while men were more likely to pretend because of insecurity.Researchers at the University of Kansas carried out three studies among a group of 1,600 men and women in a bid to help therapists treating couples.Overall, 64 per cent of men and women have pretended to climax. More than half of women said they do it regularly. Among the 143 reasons given were being drunk; tired; because it was taking too long; and because mum was coming home.Professor Omri Gillath, study co-author, said: "Faking orgasms is associated with sexual dysfunction and marital issues. Our findings can help clinicians to better tailor therapy."
