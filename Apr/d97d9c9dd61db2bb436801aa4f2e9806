The hearing of a graft case against former  Kenya Veterinary Vaccines Production Institute MD has been adjourned until September 18. Milimani senior principal magistrate Felix Kombo put off the case to enable parties to prepare their case. Dr Geofrey Mutai, a former MD with KVVPI has denied two counts of abuse of office. The prosecution alleges that on January 20, 2014, at the Kenya Veterinary Vaccines Production Institue headquarters in Nairobi, he used his office to improperly confer a benefit to Justus Kigen. He is said to have executed a contract allowing him to utilise 70 acres of KVVPI land at Limuru before undertaking the necessary tendering processes. Mutai is also accused of failing to comply with the law relating to procurement and also failing to comply with applicable procedures and guidelines.  He is out on a Sh500,000 bond.
