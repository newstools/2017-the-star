His closest contestant former West Mugirango MP James Gesami garnered 12,126 votes. Dr John Kumenda came third with 939 votes. Announcing the results at Kebirigo Secondary School, county returning officer Thaddeus Nyanchwaya said the exercise was free and fair, despite hiccups, chaos and confusion, which led to delays in many polling centres.Nyanchwaya said he received results from 78 polling centres. Results from six centres were not delivered to the tallying centre at Kebirigo Secondary.Gesami and Kumenda said the nomination was unfair. Gesami blamed the party&rsquo;s National Elections Board for the disorganisation.The two did not vote for themselves because of the confusion that marred the nominations.&ldquo;I did not vote because there was no register. This exercise is a sham and should be nullified,&rdquo; said Kumenda, a medic based in Kisii.Gesami said, &ldquo;There was no nomination in Nyamira. Just look at the turnout. It is very clear that only about 10 per cent of my supporters turned up.&rdquo;He pulled out of the race on Tuesday.Gesami said he had already lodged a complaint at Orange House over what he called shambolic polls. He refused to divulge his next step, saying he has been in ODM for long and wants his grievances addressed.In West Mugirango constituency, former Kenya National Union of Teachers Nyamira executive secretary Julius Matwere floored three opponents to win the ODM ticket.Matwere had 1,207 votes against Peter Omboga, who came second with 906.
