The IEBC has pledged to hold a public exhibition to demonstrate how the Sh3 billion electoral technology acquired from a French firm will work on August 8.Chairman Wafula Chebukati said the first batch of the Kenya Integrated Elections Management System is expected by mid this month.The kits are being supplied by Safran Identity and Security.&ldquo;The supplier has undertaken to deliver all the 45,000 kits in time for testing and certification 60 days before the elections as required by law. Once the commission receives the kits, it will hold a public exhibition to showcase how the new system works,&rdquo; Chebukati said yesterday.The speed of the vendor is a big relief to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission that is racing against tight timelines as the general election beckons.According to the electoral laws, verification of voters should start on May 10 and must be done through biometrics.The law also makes it mandatory that the technology must be acquired 60 days to the polls.Initially, the National Super Alliance had warned that the polls stand impugned and legally compromised even before they are held.&ldquo;There is no chance in the world you will be able to comply with ... provisions of the Elections Act, even within the next 60 days. In any event, the timeliness have been breached,&rdquo; NASA said in a letter to Chebukati.Yesterday, the commission announced that only 57 political parties have submitted their membership lists, paving way for primaries.Chebukati said 10 political parties are yet to submit their membership lists.The IEBC has generated the first draft of the voter register, which has a total of 19,530,312 voters, he said.&ldquo;This number is likely to change due to ongoing quality assurance processes both at the field and headquarter levels,&rdquo; Chebukati told reporters.The commission had acknowledged 128,926 Kenyans share ID or passport numbers in its database, in a startling admission of a flawed register.The IEBC boss also warned that his team will not tolerate any form of violence during political rallies and other political engagements.&ldquo;The commission wishes to remind all stakeholders of the sanctions for infringing the provisions of the Code of Conduct, including warnings, fines and cancelling the right of political parties or candidates to participate in the election,&rdquo; he said.
