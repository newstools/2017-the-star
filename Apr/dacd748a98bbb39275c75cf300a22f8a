Politicians are not campaigning in violence-prone Tiaty subcounty where security operations are underway to flush out invading bandits and disarm residents.The security situation raised concern among Pokot residents, who say they have been neglected, yet it is their democratic right to vote.|They said no-show politicians risk losing Tiaty votes.Former Kositei location councillor Mzee Yudah Losutan said the leaders, including Tiaty MP Asman Kamama, vanished from the area since the operation kicked off three three weeks ago.&ldquo;We are not certain that the Jubilee Party nominations slated for April 21 will work in Tiaty because we have not seen any politician campaigning, or a single poster on the walls,&rdquo; the former chief said. &ldquo;We hear that only major towns like Marigat, Kabarnet and Eldama-Ravine towns are awash with posters.&rdquo; Losutan told the Star in Chemolingot on Wednesday that even Kanu leaders, who used to frequent the subcounty, are steering clear.They include Baringo Senator Gideon Moi, his West Pokot counterpart John Lonyangapuo and the county speaker William Kamket.&ldquo;It has gotten worse since recent killing of parliamentary aspirant Engineer Pepee Kitambaa and Loyamorok MCA Frederick Cheretei,&rdquo; Losutan said.The former chief was with Musa Amokon, Bishop Richard Kachepko, Micah Kolem, Bishop Joel Lopeta and former Akoret councillor Omari Kukat.They concurred with him.Losutan said apart from deserting the Pokot, the leaders have been mum over the security operation by the KDF, police reserviss and regular police.There are about 31,700 voters in the subcounty across 21 locations and seven wards. Losutan said the aspirants risk losing the Pokot vote if they do not interact with them.
