The electoral agency has dashed the hopes of political parties for an extension of the nominations deadline.After hours of deliberation with 14 political parties, including Jubilee and ODM, the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission announced it will stick to the Wednesday deadline.During the closed-door talks, some political parties made a strong case for the extension of the ongoing primaries, but the commission rejected their pleas.&ldquo;After deliberations, the commission directs political parties to complete their nominations within the gazetted timelines,&rdquo; IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati announced.There are fears Jubilee, whose nominations completely flopped in a record 21 counties last Friday, is headed for a rough time with only three days remaining.JP has planned nominations, including in its strongholds of Nyeri, Nyandarua and Nakuru on the last day &ndash; with no possibility of a repeat if the polls are bungled.But party secretary general Raphael Tuju said they are determined to get everything right and will not seek extension.He said the request was made by Musalia Mudavadi&rsquo;s ANC and Kanu.Parties have until May 10 to resolve disputes arising from the primaries.Yesterday, the IEBC and political parties also discussed the contentious issue of party hopping.The Council of Governors had moved to the High Court in a bid to have the section prohibiting party hopping expunged.&ldquo;The meeting noted that the matter is before the court, and the ruling is scheduled for May 29. However, the commission has directed its legal team to explore with the court the possibility of early disposal of the matter on or before April 26, 2017,&rdquo; Chebukati said.For the first time yesterday, Chebukati said political parties are only permitted to use their membership list in the primaries.&ldquo;The 2013 IEBC register may only be used as a reference point for identifying the polling station where the voters are based,&rdquo; he said. The electoral agency also emphasised it has not shared the 2017 IEBC register with any political party.Once again, Chebukati fired a warning shot against violence, saying his commission is committed to imposing sanctions on any political party or aspirant that breaches the code of conduct.During the meeting, parties agreed that to ensure fair play, the government must provide security to all parties in equal measure.
