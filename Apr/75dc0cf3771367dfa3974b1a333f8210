First Lady Margaret Kenyatta on Saturday joined thousands of Christian women in praying for peaceful elections ahead of the August 8 polls. The women faithful drawn from all parts of the country said the country cannot afford a repeat of the 2007/2008 post election violence where over 1000 people lost their lives and women subjected to sexual violence. &ldquo;This is an experience women in Kenya will never want to go through again,&rdquo; said the women through a Communiqu&eacute;&rsquo; read by PCEA Central Committee of Woman&rsquo;s Guild chairlady Veronica Muchiri &ldquo;We as a nation failed in the past, we must not fail again. Women lost their husbands, their fathers and mothers, their brothers and sisters, their sons and daughters&rdquo;, said the women after a 7-hour prayer session at the Kasarani stadium.The First Lady said women have a special role to pray as agents of peace, healing, conflict resolution and reconciliation. &ldquo;Without peace, we will collectively fail as a community and as a nation&rdquo;, she said. The national prayers were organized by the Presbyterian Church of East Africa (PCEA) Woman&rsquo;s Guild and were attended by women from the Catholic, Anglican, Methodist and Pentecostal Churches among other groups.While giving biblical examples of Esther and Abigail, the women faithful called on Kenyan women to have the courage and wisdom to stand for peace for the sake of the nation.&ldquo;Woman of Kenya, do not fear, take courage and face those who are planning to perpetuate violence and tell them to stop. If we keep silent at this time, we are the ones who will suffer most if violence breaks out during the elections&rdquo;, they said.They urged security agencies to act within the law in quelling incidents of lawlessness during political rallies to minimize chances of unnecessary deaths.The women also offered prayers for God to save the country from corruption, tribalism and hatred and drug abuse amongst the youth.&ldquo;The trend does not portend well for the future of the nation&rdquo;, said Muchiri.
