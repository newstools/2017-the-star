Governors have vowed to challenge the legality of a proposed law that allows only one appeal in an election petition. The Election Laws (Amendment) Bill 2017 seeks to amend the Elections Act No. 25 of 2011 by introducing new requirements. But the Council of Governors says the radical law is unconstitutional, and will limit the jurisdiction of the courts to hear and determine the petitions. &ldquo;A bill of this nature goes against the will of Kenyans,&rdquo; CoG chairman Peter Munya said.In February, Chief Justice David Maraga forwarded to Parliament the regulations, which he said will enable the Judiciary to determine election petitions in one year. &ldquo;If we allow that [unlimited appeals] to continue, then lots of those cases will not be resolved until 2022,&rdquo; Maraga had said. The bill is at the Second Reading stage. If approved, the Supreme Court will hear and determine the presidential poll petition only.
