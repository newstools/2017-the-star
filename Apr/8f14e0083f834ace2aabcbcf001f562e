Reports that police and military officers deployed in Laikipia have mowed down at least 500 cows belonging to nomadic armed herders are horrifying.There has always been a problem with policing in Kenya and Army deployments in civilian conflicts, but this plumbs new depths of depravity.Shooting cows by the herd should not be police and military standard operating procedure anywhere in the world. Just picture that &ndash; uniformed and heavily armed police and KDF officers opening firing with automatic rifles on grazing cattle.What&rsquo;s more, it solves nothing; the herders are now burning down tourism infrastructure on conservancies and attacking police posts.These atrocities have a chain of command and source of orders as well as officers implementing the orders known to the police and military top brass.Smart use of intelligence and policing are called for in this situation.So are lasting solutions that will work over the course of the next several drought periods when the pastoralists return in search of pasture and water.
