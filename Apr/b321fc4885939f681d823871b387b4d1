Broadcasting company SuperSport has terminated their contract with Kenyan Premier League.The bone of contention is the ruling from sports tribunal over the sixteen vs. eighteen teams.According to SuperSport, the ruling didn&rsquo;t guarantee them that KPL will still be the sole managers of the league thus terminating the contract which was set to run until 2021.SuperSports accused KPL of breach of contract after the ruling which paved way for eighteen team league.The relationship between the two sides has been rocky over the past couple of days with the South Africa-based company failing to show any KPL matches for the last two weekends.Initially, it was reported the reason as to why they were not airing the matches as because KP had not given them the full fixtures for the first half of the season in order for them to plan.SuperSport are also reported to be planning to exit the Kenyan market thus the reason why they ended their relationship with KPL.
