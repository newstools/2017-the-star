Treasury CS Henry Rotich plans to impose a 50 per cent tax on the gross revenue of betting companies, i.e. on all bets.This is unsustainable. If a punter bets Sh100, the government will take Sh50 straightway. So just for the punter to recover his bet, he will have to achieve double odds, and triple odds or more to make a profit .If this tax is enforced, the betting companies will have to close.Of course there are social problems with gambling. But we now live in an online world. Kenyans can bet online on Betway or other companies in the UK. If betting ends in Kenya, the punters will just digitally migrate to the UK.And then Kenyans will lose the sponsorship deals that have helped revitalise local sport in Kenya,If the government wants to close down the betting companies, it should do so openly. Otherwise it should set reasonable tax rates that balance the interests of government, betting companies and punters.Quote of the day: "The condition of man... is a condition of war of everyone against everyone." - English philosopher Thomas Hobbes was born on April 5, 1588
