The Siaya ODM election board is compromised and will not conduct credible nominations, Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo (pictured) said yesterday. He said it is allied to Governor Cornel Rasanga, nominated MP Oburu Oginga and Ugunja&rsquo;s Opiyo Wandayi. The board is chaired by George Rubiik, who said the primaries will be aboveboard and disgruntled hopefuls are allowed to contest the results. Midiwo spoke in Dibuoro village at the launch of Alego-Usonga MP Paris Omondi&rsquo;s campaign.
