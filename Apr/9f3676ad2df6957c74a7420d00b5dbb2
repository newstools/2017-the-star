Suspected armed Pokot bandits attacked Kagir, Baringo North, on Wednesday and injured a Tugen herder before driving away 30 cattle towards Tiaty subcounty.Kosol Kiburet, 22, lost his right ear.He was rushed for first aid at Yatya Dispensary and transferred to Marigat Subcounty Hospital, where he was admitted.The bandits overpowered the Kenya Police Reservists in a fierce exchange of fire at around 5.30pm.Resident Richard Chepchomei said the police officers in Kagir did not respond to the gunshots. The attackers drove the animals towards Seretion village in the neighbouring East Pokot, he said.Chepchomei said the attack happened barely five days after other bandits raided the area and stole more than 300 goats belonging to three families.Nothing has been done to restrain the bandits, despite the ongoing security operation by the Kenya Defence Forces, regular police and KPR.Chepchomei said the attacked Tugen herders were among more than 30,000 families who the government asked to return home after being displaced by armed Pokot bandits in the &lsquo;disturbed&rsquo; areas of Baringo North and South last month.The state assured them of security.&ldquo;They have never known peace since they returned to their homes,&rdquo; Chepchomei said.He added that their insecurity has worsened as they continue losing animals to the bandits.The attacks usually happen some three kilometres from Kagir police post, but no officer comes out to repulse the bandits, &ldquo;meaning they could be compromising the bandits to kill us in their watch,&rdquo; he said.Last month, a mother and her three-day-old baby were shot dead as they fled from attackers.President Uhuru Kenyatta ordered KDF and police officers to flush out the notorious bandits bordering Baringo, Laikipia and Elgeyo Marakwet counties.Chepchomei said the government should explain why there is no serious disarmament as was expected.He said some 10,000 people could not participate in the ongoing nominations because they are still sheltering in IDP camps.Speaking to journalists in Kabarnet town yesterday, Baringo county commander Peter Ndung&rsquo;u dismissed claims of serious attacks by the Pokot bandits.He said that is propaganda.Ndung&rsquo;u said the entire county has been peaceful for the last month and even during the ongoing party primaries.
