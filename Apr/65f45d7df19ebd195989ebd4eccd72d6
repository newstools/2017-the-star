The Kenya National Commission on Human Rights has sought the Supreme Court’s advisory opinion on whether people with pending criminal cases should hold public offices. The KNCHR wants the court to clarify on whether the fit and proper test for leadership should be determined by criminal test of conviction and acquittal for the offences or is wider. The opinion of the court will determine whether the Independent Electoral Boundaries Commission and institutions that vet candidates should ensure only persons who pass integrity test under Chapter Six should be elected. The petition was filed by the commission’s Head Redress and legal department senior counsel Victor Kamau on Thursday. “We know there are people that have been convicted and some of them have appealed but nevertheless have been convicted,” he said.
