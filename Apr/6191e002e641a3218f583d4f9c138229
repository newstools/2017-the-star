The Government has assured workers that an increment in the minimum wage is on the way despite doubts owing to statements from some stakeholders.Last week President Uhuru Kenyatta asked the private sector to increase salaries of workers.The Government, the Central Organisation of Trade Unions (COTU) and the Salaries and Remunerations Commissions (SRC) are in discussions about an increment in the minimum wage for public sector workers.State House Spokesperson Manoah Esipisu, who addressed the press at the Kisumu State Lodge on Monday said workers should have no doubt about the expected minimum wage increment.&ldquo;Government has not increased the minimum wage in two years, and the President favours an increase this year. It is something that workers can look to,&rdquo; said Esipisu.Esipisu also said President Uhuru is waiting for recommendations from the National Police Service Commission and the SRC on the subject of salaries for members of the security agencies.He said the welfare of security officers is a paramount concern to President Kenyatta.&ldquo;The President recognises that while overall the Kenyan economy remains robust, ordinary citizens still experience difficulties in their daily lives, and he is working to help tackle these challenges,&rdquo; said Esipisu.The State House Spokesperson also spoke on the President&rsquo;s new push for gender balance especially on the need for MPs to pass the Gender Bill.&ldquo;I can reiterate that the President is keen to see movement on the subject, in the context of a clear framework set out in our constitution,&rdquo; said EsipisuHe said the President believes that the 11th Parliament has a historic opportunity to stamp its authority on the matter, and in terms of legacy be remembered as the parliament that put issues related to women leadership at the very top of its agenda and thinking.&ldquo;The President is optimistic that MPs will come together in a bi-partisan way to get the job done,&rdquo; said Mr Esipisu.The President has already instructed the Leader of Majority Aden Duale to prioritise the Gender Bill before the term of the current Parliament expires.
