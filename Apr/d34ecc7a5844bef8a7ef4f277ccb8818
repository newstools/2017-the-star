Four of the six Jubilee Party Nyandarua governor race losers have refused to concede defeat.They are incumbent Daniel Waithaka, his deputy Waithaka Kirika, former Tourism executive Peter Gathimba and businessman Moses Badilisha.They have united - in what is being referred to as the Nyandarua losers&rsquo; coalition - to demand a repeat of the exercise.Former secretary to the Cabinet Francis Kimemia won the JP ticket.Senator Muriuki Karue and Simon Kanyingi conceded and called Kimemia to congratulate him.In a joint statement issued in Ol Kalou on Friday, the four losers said the nominations were a &ldquo;sham and do not reflect the will of the people&rdquo;.They said the election officials were not recruited by the County Elections Board.The group accused the National Elections Board of recruiting Kimemia&rsquo;s campaign officials and supporters.They also claimed issues raised by JP officials, aspirants and the CEB after the failed April 21 nominations were not addressed.This led to problems like photocopying of ballots because not enough ballot papers were printed, the group said.&ldquo;This compromised the integrity of the whole exercise. The ballot papers were photocopied in a shady manner across the county with aspirants and the media being kept in the dark,&rdquo; they saidThe group said the ballot papers were photocopied by the agents of one candidate.They also alleged residents, whose names were not on the party register, voted more than once.The four accused the national officials, including county commissioner, Samuel Kimiti, of being used to &ldquo;intimidate voters into selecting a particular candidate&rdquo;.&ldquo;We cannot trust the results and we will not accept them because they do not reflect the will of the people,&rdquo; the statement read.Kimiti denied being involved in election malpractices.He said voters made their own decision.
