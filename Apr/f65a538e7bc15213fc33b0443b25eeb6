NASA seems to have shifted its focus from the IEBC. The NASA chiefs went quiet on their onslaught on the commission the moment the first batch of the Kenya Integrated Electoral Management System landed. Is the IEBC getting it right this time? Sources whisper to Corridors the Wafula Chebukati (pictured) team is going flat out to correct the mistakes of 2013. Maybe Chebukati is simply burning the midnight oil.***** The party primaries are a painful moment for the big guns of politics. Vocal allies of President Uhuru Kenyatta and opposition chief Raila Odinga have disappeared from the national limelight. Reason? Their political careers are on the line. A good example is a senior ODM MP from Siaya who has always wanted to be the county political supremo, yet he is not even sure of successfully defending his own seat. Then there are two Jubilee leaders from Tharaka Nithi and Elgeyo Marwakwet. The man from Mt Kenya East has presidential ambitions, but is under siege in his very own backyard.***** A senior ODM official was nearly roughed up yesterday by supporters of one of the MP aspirants. The mob swung into action in the midmorning drama, accusing the official of working with the detractors of the party. One supporter held the official by the neck and yelled, &ldquo;you are the people who sit in this office working against the interests of our party leader, you must go!&rdquo; It took the intervention of guards to control the chaotic supporters who could have easily pulled a Magerer Lang&rsquo;at on the official barely a fortnight after executive director Oduor Ong&rsquo;wen was roughed up at the party HQ. *****A senior government official was heard whispering this week is critical in the Kenyan electoral calendar. Reason? It will give Kenyans an opportunity to differentiate between &ldquo;social media politicians&rdquo; and &ldquo;grassroots politicians&rdquo;. The state official says politicians with a huge Twitter and Facebook following are deluded into believing they also have followers on the ground. Most of them were hanging around big guns in politics hoping their support would translate into votes. Others pitched tent on electronic media as political analysts. Well, if the ODM nominations are anything to go by, they will fall like a house of cards.***** Among Nairobi governor aspirants, former Raila Odinga&rsquo;s aide Miguna Miguna seems to attract more numbers. He is eloquent and his love for strong words as well as humour can equate to none among his competitors. However, all his rallies are on social media. Corridors is wondering when he will hold a rally like all his other opponents.
