I am happy I have made my dream into a reality.&rdquo;Youth leader, Suaad Raage, has drawn her inspiration from Nasra."This gem is the first female mechanic is Somalia and is an inspiration to all," she tweeted.Nasra is among youth in Somalia who have reason to believe in empowerment following the fourth TEDxMogadishu, which was held this month.She was one of the inspirational speakers at the event.The event was aimed at creating opportunities for the youth, giving them a platform to express their creativity and courage, and boosting their chances of being self reliant.Nasra&rsquo;s story touched Dahabshiil&rsquo;s CEO Abdirashid Duale, who attended TEDx. The money transfer company has promised to help her, enabling her to develop her career as a mechanic."She is part of our vision to help youth achieve their goal in life," says Duale.
