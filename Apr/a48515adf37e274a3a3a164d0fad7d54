The prosecution on Wednesday pursued shocking evidence that links yet another police officer to the suspected killers of human rights lawyer Willie Kimani, his client Josphat Mwenda and taxi driver Joseph Muiruri.Facebook chats and phone data records retrieved from a mobile company yesterday put Wilson Kamau, a police driver attached to an undercover unit that was headed by Fredric Leliman, in an awkward position.Kamau is among other police officers called by the prosecution to testify against Leliman, Leonard Maina, a member of the Spiv team, Stephen Chebulet, Silvia Wanjiku and informer Peter Ngugi, who are accused of the murder of the three.Kamau is a member of an undercover police unit of five known as &ldquo;Spiv&rdquo; that was headed by Leliman. His work was to chauffeur members to crime spots.Kamau begged to be heard in camera after he was confronted with evidence incriminating him.Despite having said earlier that he does not know and has never met Ngugi, the data showed that he talked to the suspect at 6am on June 23, the day Kimani and the two men were killed.The two talked at least 17 times from June 23 and some of the conversations lasted more than 121 seconds.The prosecution claims Ngugi hatched the plot to kill the three and is the one who monitored their movements and later drove the car they used.The witness had finished his evidence in chief, and was being cross examined by lawyers representing the victims, LSK and International Justice Mission.&ldquo;Do you know the fifth accused person,&rdquo; he was asked.&ldquo;No.&rdquo;&ldquo;Are you friends on Facebook.&rdquo;"No, I do not think so.&rdquo;A mumbling Kamau could not explain his situation when he was also confronted with chats he exchanged with the suspect on Facebook.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know him by that name. I just wanted to buy clothes on line,&rdquo; he said.Kamau also gave a different mobile number when asked to tell court his, but later admitted he owned another line.He was then questioned in a closed-door session for more than five hours.The hearing resumes on April 24.[VIDEO] Bodies of missing lawyer Willie Kimani, client, driver found in KilimambogoCop in Willie Kimani murder case headed an undercover police unit of 5Walkie-talkie may fix Leliman in Willie Kimani&rsquo;s murder
