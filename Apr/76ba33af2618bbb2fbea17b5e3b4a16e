Kenya Forestry Service director Emilio Mugo has dismissed claims of illegal logging of indigenous trees in Kakamega Forest.He said the areas being discussed on social media include three plantations, where the KFS has authorised harvesting of mature trees planted more than 30 years ago.&ldquo;Anybody is free to go and check areas that have been authorised against the areas where [logging] is taking place,&rdquo; Mugo said.He went on, &ldquo;I know social media has been flooded with the issue of Kakamega and I want to put the record straight.&rdquo; In the past 30-40 years ago, parts of Kakamega were earmarked and planted with pines and cypress trees. Those plantations have matured. &ldquo;Our rotation period is 30 years because of soil and weather conditions,&rdquo; Mugo said.The plantations were planted so that at the end of the rotation, they would be harvested and supplied as raw material for timber industry.The chief forestry conservationist said the KFS has authorised the harvesting. Letters of allocation, authorisations and maps of those plantations are available in KFS field offices there.Mugo said, &ldquo;When you harvest those plantations and take them to the industry, that does not constitute forest degradation. The indigenous part of the natural forest in Kakamega is intact.&rdquo;&ldquo;But of course you don&rsquo;t miss a few miscreants who will move in and cut one tree but those ones we are able to cope with.&rdquo;The KFS is grappling with minor problems of encroachment into forest boundaries remote areas like in Ebombut and Mt Elgon, where there is no clear beaconing and alignments.&ldquo;The land in Mt Elgon which belongs to the county government is a settlement area. It is the only place where you have people settling above the forest line,&rdquo; Mugo said.&ldquo;What we are doing to reverse that is to secure the forest boundaries with clear beaconing so that people know the extent of the settlement,&rdquo; he said. Mugo spoke at a Nairobi hotel on Thursday during a conference to discuss the implementation of World Forestry Congress declaration on illegal trade in timber and forest products.
