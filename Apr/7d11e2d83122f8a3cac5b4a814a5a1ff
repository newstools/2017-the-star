Nairobi Governor aspirant Peter Kenneth on Wednesday asked Jubilee Party election officials to address the 'few irregularities' in the ongoing nominations."It is important to note that there are hiccups and I think the party should address them," he told journalists after casting his vote at Bidii primary school.Kenneth complained that some people were allowed to vote despite their names missing in the registers while others were denied the chance."In some centres, people whose names are not in the register were allowed to cast their ballots while in some areas, they were turned away," he said.He claimed that many locals who have voted at the Bahati and Uhuru primary school station for many years were turned away over missing names."In some centres, polling clerks have black books and are writing names of people whose names are not in the register.""In some areas , they are not allowed. That is an irregularity," he said.Kenneth said he has raised the issue with the party headquarters but urged all the aspirants and their supporters to embrace peace.He added that he will accept results if the process will be free and fair.Senator Mike Sonko also said he is frustrated that some of his supporters were not allowed to cast their votes.He told journalists at Bahati polling station that those whose names started with 'O' were missing in the registers.Also read: I read mischief over names missing in poll registers - SonkoMore on this: Sonko, Kenneth set for bruising battle for Nairobi Jubilee ticket
