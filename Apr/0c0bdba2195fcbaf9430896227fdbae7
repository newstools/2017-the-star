The reopening of Mtongwe ferry channel on March 13 brought back memories of April 29, 1994, which families of survivors and the 272 who died have been fighting to forget.For the family of Paul Chidzambo, 87, the resumption in operations is like peeling open a wound that has taken years to heal. They lost their breadwinner in the tragedy, and 23 years later, they are yet to recover from the loss. Chidzambo&rsquo;s eldest daughter Salome Mutta said the death of their brother Samuel Mbwele cut short her dreams of becoming a nurse.Mutta, who was in form four at the time at St John&rsquo;s Girls&rsquo; High School, recalls the last talk she had with her big brother.She said she had been sent home to collect school fees, and her brother, who worked at Africa Venus metal company told her to go to their office at Kipevu area the following day.It is while waiting for her brother that they received news of the sinking ferry.&ldquo;I was seated in their office and someone shouted, have you heard the news of the sinking ferry?&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;Everyone ran towards the area where the ferry used to dock, and I accompanied them because I knew my brother used that ferry and it was also the time he used to cross. We could see people struggling to swim across the ocean.&rdquo; She could not hold back her tears as she narrated how she saw bodies being taken away from the ocean, and she was among the first people to identify her brother&rsquo;s body.&ldquo;All that time when bodies were being taken out of the ocean, I silently asked God that my brother should not be one of them. But God had other plans for him and my family,&rdquo; she recalled.Mutta said the road to justice after Mbwele&rsquo;s burial has been long and tough, which has derailed them financially, physically and emotionally.CRY FOR COMPENSATIONA commission of inquiry led by Justice Msagha Mbogholi was formed by former President Daniel Moi to investigate the cause of the accident.The commission report found that the ferry was overloaded and could not sustain the rough tides of the ocean. It recommended that the families of the deceased and survivors be compensated.Mutta said a close family member who also lost their son in the tragedy was compensated but her family is still waiting for payment.&ldquo;We have been in and out of court for more than 15 years now. And now my father has refused to eat anything, even drink water, because of the delay in compensation,&rdquo; she said.Mzee Chidzambo has been on a hunger strike for almost 30 days, despite his elderly age. He says he will only eat when the government compensates him for his son&rsquo;s death.State House spokesperson Manoah Esipisu said in a press briefing that only eight families who lost their loved ones are yet to be compensated. He added, however, that it has been hard to compensate survivors of the tragedy.Kenya Ferry Service MD Bakari Gowa said most survivors had moved to court, demanding an increased amount of compensation.Families of the deceased were to receive Sh240,000, while the survivors were to be compensated according to the nature of their injuries.The commission of inquiry also suggested the channel be temporarily shut down, but it was later re-opened and operations resumed.In 2012, the maritime department declared the channel dilapitated and unsafe for human usage.The maritime said the channel did not meet the required international standards, as ramps and other facilities were broken.Under the stewardship of former Matuga MP Chirau Makwere as Transport minister and Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho as the assistant, two ferries serving the channel MV Mvita and MV Pwani were also decommissioned, leaving at least 30,000 Mtongwe residents with a headache of traveling all the way to Likoni channel to cross over to the island.The Likoni channel was overwhelmed, as it served at least 300,000 commuters and 6,000 vehicles each day.Delays of ferries, long queues of vehicles, stampedes and often breakdowns of ferries became the order of the middle class residents residing across the channel.Tourists and investors were not spared from the drama.LIKONI CHANNEL OVERWHELMEDEarly last year, chaos erupted at the Likoni channel after three ferries were grounded, leaving only two ferries to serve the bulging numbers of commuters and motorists.Top county leaders, including county officials and the now regional co-ordinator Nelson Marwa, launched a vicious attack against the former MD Musa Hassan Musa, calling for his dismissal.A few weeks later, after an impromptu visit by President Uhuru Kenyatta, Musa, alongside two other top management officials, were dismissed.However, his dismissal did not fully change the suffering of the ferry users, although there was a sigh of relief as operations continued normally after months of what was seen as sabotage by KFS workers.Incoming MD Bakari Gowa had to look for a permanent solution before disaster struck at the channel, and the best instant solution was reopening of the Mtongwe channel.Rentals houses had been abandoned and businesses shut down as people moved to areas closer to the Likoni channel, and the only active institute that remained at Mtongwe was the Kenya Navy barracks, which houses KDF soldiers.In May last year, the KFS started giving the Mtongwe channel a facelift as the government ordered for two new ferries from Turkey. Uhuru said the two ferries, bought for Sh2 billion, will arrive in June and July.At the same time, Mombasa county launched a scheme to take over the KFS and Kenya Ports Authority after claiming the constitution had devolved the services of the two institutions.The county assembly passed a bill that gave them the authority to take over KFS assets.However, Mombasa resident judge Anyara Emukhule overturned the bill and said it was unconstitutional and further ordered the county to pay back millions in losses incurred by KFS.&lsquo;LIFE-CHANGING&rsquo; RELAUNCHIn December, KFS announced plans to reopen the Mtongwe channel. It was postponed to late February, when Transport CS James Macharia was expected to launch it. However, the event was cancelled without explanation.Last month, Uhuru finally reopened the channel, a move he termed a life-changing moment.The head of state said the relaunch and additional ferries will ease pressure on Likoni channel, which serves nearly 300,000 persons daily.&ldquo;It will also boost tourism at the South Coast, especially Diani,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;At least 30,000 people are expected to benefit from this ferry,&rdquo; Uhuru said.&ldquo;Residents, tourists and investors have been complaining over the ferry, but we believe this will encourage them to invest heavily in the South Coast.&rdquo;Uhuru further said a road from Miritini to Likoni through the Port of Mombasa will be built to ease chaos on the roads.He said a feasibility phase has already started.Uhuru also revealed that the Dongo Kundu bridge is on its final stage of mapping, and the foundation has already started.Two ferries from the Likoni channel will be transferred to the Mtongwe channel.The government also announced its plans to expand the channel to accommodate vehicles, as it can only serve commuters at the moment.The area is slowly coming back to life after years of being lifeless and being a shadow of its former self.Home owners have started refurbishing their houses, ready to receive &ldquo;guests&rdquo; who will soon start streaming in to the area.A trip from the mainland to the island only take 20 minutes, contrary to previously, where it took almost an hour, with the ferry operating from 4am to 10pm.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m now saving a lot of money and time, which I previously used while using the Likoni channel. I will not be using the Likoni channel anytime soon,&rdquo; Pastor Melkizedek Anyumba said.&ldquo;We cannot thank KFS and the government enough for cutting short our trips to town.&rdquo;CALL FOR CLEANSINGHowever, some people think something &ldquo;special&rdquo; needs to be done before operations fully resume.Some elders from the Mijikenda community believe the channel needs to be cleansed before the services continues.They claim the channel has &ldquo;nuksi&rdquo; (bad omen) and some traditional rites, commonly known as tambiko, need to be performed to avoid a recurrence of the 1994 tragedy.The elders believe the blood of the people who lost their lives in the tragedy is yearning for more blood, which can lead to a similar tragedy.They say this can only be avoided if the elders perform their &ldquo;prayers&rdquo; and offer cows to the gods. The cows should be drowned in the ocean to signify how people lost their lives during the tragedy, where most people could not swim, thus losing their lives.However, Mzee Jonathan Katana, well known for hosting a radio show at a local station that widely discussed Mijikenda traditions in the early 2000s, says KFS should only conduct prayers led by religious leaders against the bad omens.&ldquo;We need to pray to God to spare us any accidents or tragedies. Religious leaders will intercede on behalf of everyone who will use the ferry,&rdquo; he said.
