Kenya is bracing up for another doping scandal after it emerged that five top athletes are on the radar of anti-doping authorities after testing positive for banned substances.Athletics Kenya have already revealed that one of the athletes have been confirmed.However, AK president Jackson Tuwei, in his statement, could not reveal the athlete&rsquo;s name as yet, as the due process waits.The five have returned exemplary results in their latest outings but found the going tough after almost all of them were placed on the IAAF testing pool earlier this year.Sources intimidated that the confirmed athlete is on the run to avoid audience with anti-doping officers and thus delay the revealing of her name.Tuwei said: &ldquo;There is another high-profile athlete who has also failed a doping test but we have to wait for legal procedures to be followed. &ldquo;Obviously we cannot say who the athlete is.&rdquo;The body must be avoiding a situation like they caught themselves in in 2015, where a pre-mature announcement of former world record holder Wilson Kipsang&rsquo;s missed test saw them reprimanded by the IAAF and forced to pay damages to the runner.In addition, the Anti-Doping Agency of Kenya said they are yet to get information about the list of the nabbed runners.&ldquo;Adak has not received this information,&rdquo; said Eddy Nyoro, an officer at the Adak Compliance Department. &ldquo;Where did it come from?However, a source familiar with the situation intimidated that the athlete in question is currently on the run as she avoids anti-doping officials. The announcement of her name can&rsquo;t be made before she is officially communicated to.&ldquo;She is all over,&rdquo; said the source. &ldquo;She is criss-crossing the Rift Valley counties looking for a safe place to hide now and then as she is afraid of the damage that the announcement will do, not only to her but to the sport.&rdquo;&ldquo;If all the names are confirmed, then it is going to be one of the biggest dope scandals in the country,&rdquo; added the source. &ldquo;They are not just your usual distance runners since of them have returned some of the best performances in the sport, recently.&rdquo;The latest failed test(s) come just days after Olympic champion Jemimah Sumgong tested positive for the banned blood-booster EPO (Erythropoietin) in an out-of-competition test carried out by the IAAF.Tuwei said the IAAF had rejected Sumgong&rsquo;s explanation about the circumstances that led to her positive test.&ldquo;Her explanation has been rejected and she has been ordered to send a more convincing explanation before further action is taken,&rdquo; Tuwei said.Sumgong&rsquo;s positive test came in the wake of a four-year ban handed to multiple big city marathon champion Rita Jeptoo, Sumgong&rsquo;s former training partner, after she tested positive for EPO in 2014.&ldquo;We also wish to send a very strong message to athletes representatives, doctors, coaches and all athletes support personnel that those found culpable or proved to be encouraging our athletes in this line of sporting subterfuge will be charged as prescribed by the law of the land,&rdquo; AK said in a separate statement.Sumgong, 32, was among the six Kenyan gold medallists in Rio, which was the country&rsquo;s best performance at an Olympic outing.
