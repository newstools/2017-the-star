Two ODM camps in Kilifi have argued over the list of presiding officers and clerks to oversee Saturday&rsquo;s primaries.One camp is led by woman rep Aisha Jumwa and the other by Willy Mtengo, who are both seeking the Malindi MP ticket.On Tuesday Mtengo said he was surprised to see a new list of ODM election officials instead of the old ones who had been trained.But on Wednesday Jumwa said no aspirant has the power to influence election officials who have been assigned from the party headquarters.&ldquo;This is a sign of defeat. The role of aspirants is to campaign and mobilise supporters, not to panic over a list of clerks and presiding officers,&rdquo; she said. Mtengo said the panel presented to aspirants by Governor Amazon Kingi, the county ODM chairman, should be allowed to conduct the nominations.
