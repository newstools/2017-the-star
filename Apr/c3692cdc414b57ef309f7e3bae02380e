Homa Bay governor hopeful Oyugi Magwanga on Monday criticised incumbent Cyprian Awiti for using public funds for his campaigns.Awiti has been traversing the county on his campaign caravan distributing money from the Aswekra Fund to small-scale traders, while campaigning to retain his job.The Homa Bay ODM primaries will be held today.&ldquo;I think this is unfair for the governor to take advantage of the money meant to benefit the small traders to campaign for his reelection,&rdquo; Magwanga said.The Sh15 million fund was meant to support 300 women&rsquo;s groups operating small businesses. Awiti said the claims are far-fetched. He said the fund was meant to support small-scale traders who lack the capacity to borrow bank loans. The fund is a product of the assembly and was approved by it, Awiti said.Magwanga said, &ldquo;I think distribution of such funds should be something official but not [done] using a branded caravan moving around then just giving out the funds without any proper criteria followed.&rdquo; He was speaking in Rangwe constituency.
