The Malindi High court on Monday extended the IEBC April 26 deadline for party primaries to May 1.This followed a petition by Angaza Empowerment Network, an NGO operating in the region.The organisation moved to court seeking an extension of the party nominations deadline from April 26 to May 7.The matter was filed by George Mirigu, director Angaza Empowerment Network, before Justice Weldon Korir.In his affidavit, Mirigu argued that the exercise was marred with chaos and faced logistical problems."From these happenings, the IEBC should extend the party primaries."On Sunday, the electoral agency said the deadline will not be extended.Chairman Wafula Chebukati told parties to conclude their primaries within the stipulated timeline to allow them prepare for August 8.Read: Poll deadline will not be extended beyond April 26, IEBC tells partiesMirigu said: "Slicing ten days from the period allowed for parties to conduct nominations as spelled in Section 13 (1) of the Elections Act is a violation of the provision of the rights of Kenyans."The laws states that a political party shall nominate its candidates for an election at least 45 days before a general election.The nominations are required to be in accordance with the party constitution and nomination rules.Angaza told the court that IEBC has breached Kenyans rights by setting the deadline for parties to submit the list of candidates on Wednesday, April 25."This limited the time required for Kenyans to exercise rights to choose preferred candidates for parties they support." "That the breach of my rights has national consequences on the rights of citizens to effectively exercise their political rights," Mirigu said.
