Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale's bid for governor is as good as dead on arrival, ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi&rsquo;s adviser on coalition matters Wasai Nanjakululu said yesterday. He said Khalwale will pay dearly for &ldquo;auctioning&rdquo; the community by leading other Luhya representatives in the NASA National Coordinating Committee in discrediting Mudavadi and Ford Kenya's Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula. &ldquo;The two principals are disturbed that they can send their trusted lieutenants to push for the interest of the community and they turn out to be sellouts,&rdquo; Nanjakululu said in Kakamega. "The fact that Khalwale and company only left Sakwa Bunyasi with Kipruto Kirwa and Mohammed Yare to defend Mudavadi in the committee is a big embarrassment." A leaked document by the NCC recommended a Raila Odinga-led ticket with his Wiper counterpart Kalonzo Musyoka as running mate.
