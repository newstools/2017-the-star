Kenya Tea Development Agency factories are operating below average following a sharp drop in green leaf delivered by farmers, the agency reported yesterday.Green leaf delivery by farmers has dropped by 25 per cent to 705.2 million kilogrammes in nine months through March compared to 936.6 million kilogrammes in a similar period last year.The agency has attributed the sharp drop to the acute prolonged dry spell which hit the country in the last eight months. The worst hit areas are Kirinyaga, Nyeri and Embu counties.The production dip and lower prices at the Mombasa Tea Auction are expected to affect tea earnings which totaled Sh84 billion last year, translating to lower earnings for the 560,000 smallholder farmers.February was the worst hit month with green leaf delivered by farmers dropping 52 per cent to 54.3 million kilogrammes, compared to 114 million kilogrammes in February 2016. March saw a drop of 35.8 per cent to 77.9 million kilogrammes.&ldquo;Factories in the worst hit areas are operating for only two days per week to reduce operating expenses among other cost-cutting measures that have been put in place,&rdquo; KTDA chief executive Lerionka Tiampati said in a statement yesterday. Prices at the Mombasa Tea Auction have been lower at an average $2.50 ( about Sh258.1) per kilogramme of tea in the nine months to March. This compares poorly to the $2.74 (about Sh 282.9)average for a similar period last year.The depressed prices are mainly attributed to the surplus tea in the market carried over from last year. Industry data shows that in the year ending June 2016, the global tea market had a surplus of 179 million kilogrammes.
