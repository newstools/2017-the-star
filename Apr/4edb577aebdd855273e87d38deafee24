Meru High court on Thursday dismissed a petition seeking to bar Governor Peter Munya from the August polls over audit queries.Judge Alfred Mabeya struck out the petition saying Isaiah Kithinji- the petitioner - did not exhaust avenues to resolve his concerns.He said the petitioner did not engage institutions mandated to handle matters he has set out in his claim against Munya.Mabeya said the businessman should have first filed a complaint with the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC).He said EACC has already admitted they were probing the county government of Meru over various corruption allegations."The EACC is yet to conclude its investigation and cannot be undermined by this court. The petition is struck out."Bonbegi Gesicho, who held brief for Munya's lawyer Okong&rsquo;o Omogeni, told journalists after the ruling that the governor is free to campaign.He asked the residents seeking to file similar petitions to exhaust help from constitutional institutions before going to court.In his petition, Kithinji listed Munya as respondent; Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission as the first interested party.PNU secretary general, Auditor General, and EACC were listed as second, third and fourth interested parties in the matter.The petitioner wanted governor Munya to be denied nominations by PNU on grounds of misappropriating of county funds.The allegations spelled out in the March 28 petition are hinged on audit reports for financial years 2013/2014, and 2014/2015.Read: No petition will bar me from August polls &ndash; Munya
