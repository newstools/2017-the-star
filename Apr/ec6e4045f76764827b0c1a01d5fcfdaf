Jubilee nominations in Mombasa are facing problems after members split on the method of selection.The situation is worsening, particularly in Nyali constituency. The controversy is pitting hopefuls Ashiraf Bayusuf and Ali Noor against each other.Bayusuf prefers the use of JP cards for primaries, but Noor is favouring the use of national IDs.JP members, who have the cards, had their particulars taken and documented electronically, limiting possibilities of intruders participating.Bayusuf argues that if IDs are used, ODM might sponsor its supporters to choose a weaker candidate.But Noor claims that one&rsquo;s national ID will be corroborated with the party&rsquo;s list to eliminate nonmembers.Bayusuf said he bought 15,000 party cards for supporters. There was a heated argument when the two met. The meeting was chaired by JP&rsquo;s governor hopeful Suleiman Shahbal. They failed to reach an agreement. Bayusuf wants JP secretary general Raphael Tuju to intervene. &ldquo;Why is he objecting to the use of cards? What&rsquo;s he up to? It&rsquo;s only through the card that genuine members will be identified and allowed to nominate,&rdquo; Bayusuf said on the phone on Tuesday.
