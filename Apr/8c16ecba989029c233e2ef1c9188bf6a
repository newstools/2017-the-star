ODM has nullified Bondo MP Gideon Ochanda's win and declared nominated MP Oburu Oginga winner of the party ticket for the constituency seat.Oburu is said to have received 15,784 votes against Ochanda's 9,538 in the latest results on Wednesday.Earlier, Ochanda had been declared the winner after reportedly getting 28,446 votes against Oburu's 4,000 despite the latter's spirited campaign.But Oburu rejected the results and ordered a recount that started at around 1 pm. The Siaya ODM returning officer Joshua Anyona left for Kisumu where he announced the fresh results.Oburu fought claims that he is too old for the seat.His competitors said he has been active in politics for over 20 years and there is nothing to show for it.Ochanda had asked the legislator, who is Raila Odinga's elder brother, to retire.But Oburu said he has defeated Ochanda three times before and he will do it again this year.Read: Oburu Oginga, Onyango Oloo lose in Bondo, Kisumu ODM primaries as incumbents retain seats
