NASA won big yesterday as the IEBC caved in to pressure and allowed the opposition alliance to operate a parallel tallying system. The condition is that it&rsquo;s only for internal use. The opposition alliance now can implement a vote protection strategy involving 45,000 polling agents deployed countrywide on August 8. After meeting for nearly three hours with NASA captains at Anniversary Towers, IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati emerged to announce even the media would be free to tally and verify results.&ldquo;Parties recognise it is the mandate of the IEBC to announce and declare the results of an election. However, political parties and media may monitor, tally and verify the results for the own internal use,&rdquo; Chebukati told a joint press briefing with the opposition.But only the commission may announce and declare results, he said. The commission had previously insisted any parallel tallying system would be illegal.This despite there being no legal prohibition.The issue was controversial, providing political fodder for the ruling Jubilee coalition, which said NASA&rsquo;s system is meant to muddle the outcome because it knows it will lose.DP William Ruto said, &ldquo;It is now obvious the opposition has no formula for winning because they have no agenda, no candidate. They want to have a shortcut to win by planning to establish a parallel tallying centre to announce results for themselves as winners.&rdquo;NASA says it fears the polls are likely to be rigged in favour of Jubilee and wants to ensure tallies will not be manipulated.The vote protection game plan, credited for the recent opposition victory in Ghana, involves NASA relaying results direct from all polling stations to its tallying centre in Nairobi.Agents will be in constant communication with the central command team at the secretariat, according to the game plan by Raila and his think tanks.Some agents will take videos and photos of electoral materials, including Forms 34 and 36, which would be irrefutable evidence in case of a challenge to the outcome of the presidential vote.Based on the polling station&rsquo;s voter register, agents will monitor who has not voted, trace them and ensure they vote.The meeting was attended by all the four NASA chiefs &ndash;&ndash; ODM&rsquo;s Raila Odinga, Wiper&rsquo;s Kalonzo Musyoka, ANC&rsquo;s Musalia Mudavadi and Ford Kenya&rsquo;s Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula.Most of NASA&rsquo;s 12-member National Coordinating Committee tasked to pick the presidential flagbearer were also present.The NASA bosses declined to comment on the sensitive issue of its presidential candidate, even after it emerged the NCC had endorsed a Raila-Kalonzo ticket.NASA is considering a proposal to create the position of a chief minister, equivalent to a powerful Prime Minister, to be taken by Mudavadi, if NASA wins.The PM would have sweeping powers to whip the Cabinet and an expanded mandate to supervise and coordinate government business.Wetang&rsquo;ula would become the influential Speaker of the National Assembly, currently the third most powerful position after the President and DP.However, the decision on adopting the line-up will be made by the four principals. A section of ANC leaders deny the existence of such a plan.&ldquo;Kenyans should ignore such misleading information and remain steadfast in trying to unite the majority of Kenyans in NASA,&rdquo; ANC secretary general Godfrey Osotsi said.After the meeting the opposition, the IEBC conceded that audit firm KPMG will engage all stakeholders on the process of auditing the voter register. &ldquo;This will ensure that everyone is on board during this critical process,&rdquo; Chebukati said.NASA insists the IEBC database is rotten.This after the electoral agency, in a startling admission of a flawed register, acknowledged 128,926 Kenyans share ID or passport numbers in its database.Chebukati said NASA welcomed the commission&rsquo;s initiative for regular engagement with political parties through the Political Parties Consultative Forum, which he himself will chair.The new IEBC boss also announced the commission is organising a national conference on elections in June.In its weekly briefing on Wednesday, the IEBC had pledged to hold a public exhibition to demonstrate how the Sh3 billion electoral technology acquired from a French firm will work.The first batch of the Kenya Integrated Elections Management System (KIEMS) is expected by mid this month.&ldquo;Parties are committed to transparent acquisition and deployment of electoral technology. The Commission shall share more information on the KIEMS with stakeholders, including specifications,&rdquo; Chebukati saidThe IEBC also appeared to backtrack on its statement that ODM nominations that are scheduled before April 12 are illegal.Chebukati and his team had said that no primaries should take places before the list of participants is gazetted by April 12.However ODM primaries are to start tomorrow in Bungoma, Busia and Machakos.After the meeting, IEBC said it would consult and communicate to ODM by this morning on the way forward.Raila had rubbished the IEBC condition, saying the commission has no business interfering in the affairs of political parties.But in the IEBC statement,Chebukati said all stakeholders, including political parties, should condemn violence and encourage members to desist from any conduct likely to cause trouble.This was just a day after goons affiliated to nominated Senator Elizabeth Ongoro roughed up ODM Executive Director Oduor Ong&rsquo;wen.Violence had also rocked a separate ODM rally in Migori on Monday when one of the bodyguards to Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho was shot in the leg.
