Former Kathiani MP Wavinya Ndeti stands a better chance of winning the governor race now that she has joined Wiper, Machakos County Pastors Forum chairman Daniel Mutua has said.&ldquo;We thank Chama Cha Uzalendo members for allowing their party leader to join Wiper,&rdquo; he told the press in Athi River town on Monday. Mutua said Wiper helped incumbent Alfred Mutua win in 2013.He said Ndeti has gained popularity in all eight subcounties. Mutua said, &ldquo;We did not support Ndeti in 2013, but we have reconciled.&rdquo; He said Ndeti has supported the church and deserves to have the favour returned. The cleric said Machakos needs a governor who respects the church. He said the church has suffered under Governor Mutua&rsquo;s administration. Mutua cited being taxed for putting up posters in public places.
