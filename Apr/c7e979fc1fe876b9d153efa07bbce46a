Kimilili MP aspirant Didmus Baraza is nursing serious injuries at the Kimilili Subcounty Hospital after being attacked on Thursday night.The Jubilee Party member says he was beaten up by fellow JP legislator aspirant Joe Khaemba, politician Chrispinus Masinde, an MCA hopeful and their supporters at 8pm at Lechante Hotel, Kimilili town, during a Jubilee aspirants meeting.Baraza said he was attacked after he said his rivals were hiring their cronies to oversee Monday JP nominations.He told journalists in hospital that he questioned why their chief campaigners were hired to oversee the polls.&ldquo;The question did not go down well with my rivals who thought I was harassing the chairman and began fighting me. Before I knew it, I heard a loud bang on my head and I blacked out,&rdquo; Baraza said.He asked Bungoma Governor Kenneth Lusaka to intervene and help solve the issue. Baraza asked Lusaka to provide him with bodyguards as he heard his attackers say they will kill him.A medic said Baraza suffered a broken hand, twisted neck and injured ribs but was responding to treatment.Kimilili MCA David Baraza, who visited the aspirant in the hospital, asked Bungoma county commissioner Joshua Chepchieng to arrest the attackers.&ldquo;We cannot have people beating up an honourable person like Didmus and still going scot free and chest thumping in town how bad they are,&rdquo; he said.David said he was also attacked and threatened with beheading a week ago by the same people. He reported to the police but no action has been taken.Khaemba and the accused attackers did not pick our calls or respond to text messages.Kimilili OCPD Mary Wachu said police are investigating the attack.She urged residents to remain calm and let police carry out there duties.Kimilili, which has attracted the highest number of Jubilee aspirants, is set for a tough battle among Rose Natecho, John Wenya, Joe Khaemba and Baraza.
