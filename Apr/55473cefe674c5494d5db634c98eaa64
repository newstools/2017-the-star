Bungoma ANC senatorial aspirant David Makali has said he will help the Ogiek community if he wins.Makali addressed residents of Kaboiywo and Toboo in Kaptama ward on Wednedsay during his tour of Mt Elgon. He urged the Ogiek to vote for leaders who will champion their interests. Makali said various governments have greatly neglected the community since independence. The county government, under Governor Kenneth Lusaka, has done little to empower the community, Makali said. &ldquo;Devolution came to empower marginalised people like you but no tangible thing has been done here so far,&rdquo; he said. Makali said the poor state of roads and lack of clean drinking water have exposed the residents to hardship.
