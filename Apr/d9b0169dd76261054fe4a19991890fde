Lamu assembly speaker Mohamed Hashim, who is eyeing the Senate seat, has defected from Jubilee to ANC.The defection of Hashim, a former point man of Governor Issa Timamy&rsquo;s main rival Fahim Twaha, is a huge boost to Timamy&rsquo;s reelection.Last month, Hashim announced publicly he would seek the JP ticket.But speaking in Lamu on Friday, the former Lamu East MP said he no longer felt confident in Jubilee .&ldquo;I am tired of the senator oppressing me and making it clear that I stood no chance in the party. I want to be in a party that takes care of the interests of all its members equally and that&rsquo;s ANC,&rdquo; Hashim said.&ldquo;My gut feeling tells me fairness will not prevail during JP primaries. Thank God I won&rsquo;t be there when it happens.&rdquo;
