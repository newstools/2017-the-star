Footage from a camera phone has sensationally revealed David Moyes threatening a female reporter when he thought the cameras had stopped rolling. The Sunderland boss, who has since apologised, took exception to being asked if he was under more pressure with club chairman Ellis Short in the stands for his side's 0-0 draw with Burnley last month.BBC reporter Vicki Sparks was then told by Moyes: "It was getting a wee bit naughty at the end there so just watch yourself. You still might get a slap even though you're a woman."He then went one step further and added: "Careful the next time you come in."During the interview Moyes had abruptly told Sparks he was not under any pressure at all but when he thought his television duties were done, his manner changed. Though Sparks appeared to awkwardly laugh off the remarks, Moyes seemed as though he was not joking.An anonymous colleague lambasted the Sunderland manager's behaviour in saying: "This is disgraceful bullying and sexism, ending with a chilling warning."A Sunderland spokesman told the Daily Star: "David and the reporter spoke to one another subsequently and the matter was resolved amicably."The BBC also released a statement which read: "Moyes has apologised to our reporter and she has accepted his apology."Sunderland are rooted to the foot of the Premier League and lie eight points adrift of safety having lost 1-0 against Watford on Saturday.The Black Cats are in need of a special run of performances if they are to rescue their season with eight games to go.Moyes' stock appears to be in decline and he even admitted at the start of the campaign that he felt his team would be in a scrap at the bottom.The Scot has seen his career trajectory change since leaving Everton in 2013. Having taken over from Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United, the 53-year-old was sacked after less than one season in charge at Old Trafford.A year with Real Sociedad followed but he was dismissed after a poor start to the season in November 2015.The pressure is mounting on both Moyes and Sunderland as they look to mount a dramatic escape from their current predicament.
