With only 115 days left to the August general election, the IEBC is yet to re-tender for the supply of ballot papers, raising eyebrows over its preparedness.Lawyer and political analyst Danstan Omari yesterday said the unexplained delay in floating the tender portrays the IEBC as not ready to manage the polls.It could also point to a desire to single-source to avoid public scrutiny, he said.&ldquo;The IEBC is more engaged in noncore business and public relations. At the moment, all cases have been dispensed [with], but as we speak, the bidding has not been done. What we read is either they are not prepared for the August polls or they want to do it so close to the election to leave no room for open tendering and they will opt for direct or single sourcing to evade scrutiny and maybe create avenues and sanitise corruption,&rdquo; he said.Omari said this will lead to opaqueness as the public will not have the information needed, which will breed suspicion and mistrust in the entire election management.He said awarding the tender close to election will lead to delayed delivery of materials, which will give room for errors and no time for corrections.Election Observers Group coordinator Mulle Musau said the delay is a point of concern. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s important for the IEBC to have [an] open process. Stakeholders should understand they are dealing with a new IEBC team, which is working under tight timelines,&rdquo; he said.On February 13, Justice George Odunga nullified the Sh2.5 billion tender awarded to Al Ghurair Printing and Publishing Company to supply 130 million ballot papers.The tender to the Dubai-based company was quashed, citing lack of compliance with election laws, after the tendering was challenged by Cord. Odunga directed re-tendering for the supply and delivery of ballot papers in line with the law.On March 10, three appellate judges upheld the ruling, dismissing the IEBC&rsquo;s case seeking to challenge the High Court&rsquo;s decision.Despite a month elapsing since the ruling was delivered, the IEBC has not re-advertised for the tender.IEBC chief executive Ezra Chiloba yesterday did not pick calls or respond to text messages on whether the delay was deliberate to give room for the commission to do direct sourcing or it is just ill-prepared to manage the polls.Jubilee Party secretary general Raphael Tuju yesterday said there is no cause to worry, arguing that the ballot papers can be printed within 30 days. He said there is international capacity to print ballot papers in bulk. Tuju spoke to the Star on the phone.
