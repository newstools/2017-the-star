Candidates contesting in the August polls are required to declare public resources they hold, including vehicles, to the IEBC by May 2 to curb misuse during campaigns.Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission chairman Wafula Chebukati yesterday warned that any public servant, including elected leaders, who does not comply will be held liable for at least Sh2 million fine or six-year jail or both.Section 14 of the Election Offences Act 2016 bans use of state resources in campaigns in addition to barring both the national and county governments from advertising their achievements in print, electronic, banners or billboards during the election period.Makueni Senator Mutula Kilonzo Jr, however, argued that it is not unlawful for a government to showcase its merits by using media and other public platforms to promise new projects to influence voters for reelection.&ldquo;A member of the commission, any person designated by the Commission or any authorised agency shall have the power to impound or to order the impounding of any state resources that are unlawfully used in a campaign,&rdquo; Chebukati said in a statement. The Act gives the IEBC powers to write to any public servant, including an MP, governor and his deputy and MCA to declare state assets attached to them by virtue of offices they hold.Kilonzo said Chebukati has failed to punish public servants using government resources to campaign. He said President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s administration is &ldquo;using all state machinery available&rdquo; while governors are &ldquo;moving around in GK vehicles&rdquo; campaigning.&ldquo;The IEBC should ensure action is taken rather than issuing notices. I would propose that all aspirants holding public office should sign a Code of Conduct explicitly allowing their elections to be nullified if it is found that they used public resources,&rdquo; Kilonzo said.He added that the commission should ensure the national and county government officials do not access public coffers to campaign instead of not just disclosing public resources in possession.Chebukati said the officers should submit the information to the IEBC Anniversary Towers headquarters offices in Nairobi.
