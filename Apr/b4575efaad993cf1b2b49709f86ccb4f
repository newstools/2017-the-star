All JP primaries , including those in the DP&rsquo;s backyard, in an unprecedent and humiliating primaries debacle.Yesterday, JP headquarters yesterday dispatched high-powered teams to the two regions to oversee the nominations and prevent disasters like the one that caused cancellation of all primaries on Friday last week.Joseph Mathai, the region&rsquo;s party&rsquo;s coordinator, said they would put in measures to ensure credible polls. &ldquo;This time it will be all systems go and we hope to do the best nominations,&rdquo; he said.Ruto&rsquo;s allies have spent heavily to win nominations for the August 8 polls. The DP has kept off the campaigns, but sources say he is monitoring the exercise remotely, amid fears the heated campaigns may lead to chaotic nominations.Most of Ruto&rsquo;s allies are in Nandi county, and are battling for the governor&rsquo;s seat. They include Governor Cleophas Lagat, former ministers Henry Kosgey, ex-Agriculture CS Felix Koskei, and Nandi Senator Stephen Sang.&ldquo;We are hoping for free and fair nominations in which the people will decide, but I have high hopes of winning,&rdquo;Sang said.
