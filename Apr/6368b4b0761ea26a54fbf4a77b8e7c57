The President has reiterated that national and county governments should complement each other, not engage in "unnecessary" competition.Uhuru Kenyatta said the competition witnessed in terms of development projects must come to an end."We should do these things together...my hope is that as we move forward, this transformation journey should not be a competition," he said at the launch of the information portal on Monday."If we did not have such weird thinking by some governors, we would be doing things together."The President noted that having counties does not mean the national government cannot implement projects at their level.Uhuru said Kenya does not have a system in which counties and the national government are separate and that we are all Kenya.He touched on tourism in Mombasa saying any projects launched there are for the people."We promote tourism to create opportunities for youths," he said.The President barred Mombasa county chief Hassan Joho from his relaunch of Mtongwe ferry services Joho was surrounded by heavily armed police officers at Nyali bridge amid allegations Uhuru had ordered his arrest.Uhuru later told him to focus on Mombasa issues instead of following him around as if he is his "wife".He also said the county chief looked for him during the launch of county projects for photo opportunities.The Governor had accused Uhuru of riding on donor-funded projects and those initiated by other administrations.Joho said he and others wanted to know that Uhuru's administration would give "a few billions for several projects".More on this: [AUDIO] Stop following me like I'm your wife, Uhuru tells Joho at Mtongwe ferry launchAlso see: [VIDEO] Joho lectures Uhuru on hijacking Mombasa projectsUhuru has also attacked Governors Josephat Nanok (Turkana) and Amason Kingi (Kilifi).The President called Nanok a "foolish devil" and said his county was a shameful example of poor service delivery to Kenyans.Uhuru told Kingi to stick to his lane and work towards fostering development in the county instead of hurling insults at the Jubilee administration.He expressed anger at how Kingi has been "lying to people" about national government projects in his county.More on this: After wars with Nanok, Joho, Uhuru turns heat on KingiBut he said after the portal launch: "We have been rough on governors..its okay. Some governors have also been rough on us its okay. If we did not have [weird minds] we could do even better."Members of the public and leaders had expressed concern about Uhuru's anger outbursts saying they were not marks of a good President.Johnson Muthama (Machakos Senator), Gladys Wanga (Homa Bay woman representative) and Francis Nyenze (Kitui West MP) said Uhuru's abusive utterances and actions were dividing the country and propagating hatred."Uhuru is proving to Kenyans that he is not worth being the President of this country. The President should be a symbol of unity; a unifying factor for all Kenyans," said Muthama."When he says a particular leader belongs to the Opposition and cannot come to his function, he clearly shows he is not the kind of person Kenyans can expect to be the President."More on this: Joho drama, anger outbursts show Uhuru cannot be President - Opposition
