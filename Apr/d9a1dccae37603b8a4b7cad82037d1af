Nominated Senator Elizabeth Ongoro on Friday cited unfairness, mistreatment as reasons for ditching ODM for ANC.Ongoro was received by ANC secretary general Geoffrey Osotsi, given life membership and a direct nomination for Ruaraka MP seat.The certificate seen by the Star indicates that Ongoro was given the membership on April 7, 2017.The legislator told her supporters at Amani House, Nairobi, that her rights as a woman and Kenyan must be respected."Under the constitution, I have rights to seek election. It is unfortunate that women have been taken for granted for long."She said Kenyans should not be forced with leaders that they are not keen on placing at the helm of various institutions."Wakati imefika ya wananchi kuchagua bila kulazimishwa au kutishwa (Time has come for people to elect leaders without coercion).""Wananchi watachagua viongozi wao. Kwa hivyo, mimi nimetoka kwa nyumba ya ODM na nikaingia ANC (That is why I left ODM for ANC)," she said.Ongoro's move comes after she was fined Sh1 million by the ODM disciplinary committee following the attack on executive director Oduor Ong'wen.The party asked her to apologise for storming Orange House after Ruaraka MP Tom Kajwang was handed a direct ticket.The committee recommended that she seeks the MP seat in another constituency 'for peace's sake'.Read: ODM fines Obado, Ongoro Sh3 million, demands apologies after chaos at party eventsBut Ongoro said it was not proper for ODM to tell her where to go to."Sio sawa mimi kuambiwa eti niende nitafute mahala pengine....niko na Amani ndani ya NASA."(It is not right for someone to tell me to go vie elsewhere. I am peaceful with ANC under NASA)"For leaders who don't like competition, your time is up," Ongoro said.Ongoro said she has faith and trust in NASA and that is why she was still playing the ball in their court."Kwa sababu hili boma letu la Nasa, ndio itatuletea kiongozi in August (It is the house that will give us a President in August)," she said.Earlier, Ongoro's supporters were seen at the Amani premises eagerly waiting for the nominated senator to arrive."Ongoro tena..Ongoro tena. We will not allow Ongoro to be used again," her supporters shouted on Friday.The supporters said they will be no peace in Ruaraka sub-county if Ongoro is not on the ballot on August 8.Last month, Ongoro said she is in ODM to stay but noted she can no longer be silent about intimidation and frustration.The legislator said she will be on the ballot whether her rivals like it or not.More on this: [VIDEO] Ongoro narrates ordeals at ODM, claims Kajwang' after her life
