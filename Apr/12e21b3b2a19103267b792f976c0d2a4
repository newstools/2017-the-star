The gains that Kenya&rsquo;s top flight football has made in the last decade are facing uncertain times after the Kenyan Premier League broadcast sponsors, SuperSport, in a bombshell announcement yesterday, opted out of the nearly a billion shillings multi-year deal, citing breach of contract entered between the parties.&ldquo;SuperSport has cancelled it&rsquo;s contract with the Kenyan Football League (KPL) following KPL&rsquo;s breach of the Licence Agreement entered into by the parties. The situation became untenable and it puts SuperSport at risk. Therefore SuperSport has no option but to terminate the contract,&rdquo; read a statement from SuperSport. The Pay TV broadcast sponsor reiterated, however, that they would continue delivering content in Africa and they are following due process to rid themselves from the breached deal.&ldquo;SuperSport will continue in its commitment to providing the best sports content in Africa via platforms with cutting-edge technology and on multiple devices.Formal notice of cancellation of the contract has been given and all the necessary procedures and steps are being put in place to manage the exit from this league,&rdquo; concluded the statement.For weeks, SuperSport has not been airing KPL matches with the grapevine rife with reports that they were considering leaving the scene due to, among other things the recent expansion of the league to include 18 teams and a deal by the Football Kenya Federation to partner with Bamba Sports to air national team friendly matches. But it was the expansion of the Kenyan Premier League to eighteen teams that riled SuperSport executives despite the promise by the federation to plug the financial gap brought about by the increase from 16 team to 18-team league.Signs that it was no longer business as usual were there for keen observers with sources intimating that the monthly grants that SuperSport had been giving to the top flight clubs had been stopped pending a resolution to their agreement.
