Simiyu, who has been described as a quiet person, is said to have been drinking with unidentified man on that evening.Her colleagues said they last saw her entering the hotel with a man, suspected to have later killed her.Unused condoms were recovered from the room. They said justice has been denied to their colleagues, just because they are sex workers.Commercial Sex Workers Alliance Mombasa director Benta Joseph demanded that the killings be probed.&ldquo;How long should we be hacked before the state intervenes? When shall we put to stop this inhumanity? We are your sisters,mothers and wives,&rdquo; she said.Social worker Esther Nelima said Mombasa has at least 10,500 sex workers. She said some of the sex workers are as young as 16 years, while the oldest is about 68 years.
