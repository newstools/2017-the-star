National Social Security Fund board chairman Gideon Ndambuki has thrown his hat in the ring for Makueni gubernatorial seat. Ndambuki who met various groups at Kilala and Kaumoni markets in Kaiti Constituency yesterday said he will vie on Jubilee ticket. The former Kaiti Mp will face incumbent Kivutha Kibwana (Wiper) and Nairobi-based business mogul David Masika who is contesting on a New Democrats ticket. “I have made a decision to contest on a Jubilee ticket because I have no trust in Wiper party; I was rigged out in 2013 in Senate primaries,” he told the groups that included local traders, boda boda and taxi operators. He went on: “You all know my record of development when I was Kaiti Mp, I urge you to support me so that I extent that work in the entire county.” Ndambuki who was the minister of Planning and National Development during former president Daniel Arap Moi’s regime had announced to vie for the Makueni top seat on a Wiper ticket sometimes last year but has since been quiet. He accused Kibwana of under development saying he was the best bet for the county top job. He urged Makueni residents not to focus on political parties but individuals. “I am begging for your votes with a promise to offer good leadership so that you start enjoying fruits of devolution and as well unite leaders in this county of Makueni,” he said.
