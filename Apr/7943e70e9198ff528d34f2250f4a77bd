After rocking the airwaves with his hit song Run Caleb Ndiku, young upcoming musician Machakos Kyalo is not stopping at anything coming his way and is back with another club banger, Ay Victor Wanyama, another song praising and celebrating Kenyan talent.Speaking to Word Is, the US-based rapper's passion for local talent is out of this world and is evidenced by his two latest jams, which he has dedicated to top Kenyan athletes who have proudly flown the nation's flag high on the international stage.Kyalo first started out as a poet going by the name 'Mind of Soul' before Commonwealth 5000m champion Caleb Ndiku nicknamed him Machakos Kyalo, a name he has since adopted.On his Caleb Ndiku song, the Machakos-born and bred artiste celebrates his childhood friend, who not only kept his dream alive but also persevered to become a world beater in the track field.Kyalo, who describes his music as Afro hip hop, is already causing ripples in the local music industry and his choice to celebrate Kenyan superstars through music as a form of paying tribute to them has made him stand out since it's his forte. But what really inspires his work?"I was already searching for somebody to do a song after. We don't celebrate our heroes enough and Ndiku was the closest hero motivating me and the kids in my village," he said. "Sports and music are very looked down upon. Parents encourage education, go to school be a lawyer, be a doctor, and he is living proof in our village that you can make something for yourself through sports," he added.According to the youngster, who records his songs back in Massachusetts, USA, he made it his burden to pay tribute to any Kenyan 'killing the game', adding that he is already working on a new song."I think my next song will probably be for a female athlete, maybe. I feel like I can't do three out of three being men," he said, asking Kenyans to follow him closely to find out more about his next big project.Speaking of his latest Wanyama song, he said: "It's all about celebrating what Victor Wanyama is doing, he is leaving footprints for the other Kenyan soccer players and kids who want to be superstars in the soccer world, and with that I think we should celebrate that more." "He is really just taking great strides. No one has done what he is doing right now and I am very impressed, that motivates me and it does a lot to my music and my life knowing somebody could be at the top coming from Kenya."
