Nyeri Jubilee elections board chairman George Kibira and a member resigned a few hours before the party primaries.Kibira resigned and walked out on Tuesday evening after the board members disagreed during a meeting held at a Nyeri hotel.Board member Nelson Bekenya followed suit after Kibira and handed over documents to the other board members after disagreements and feuds. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no longer a member of that group. I&rsquo;m writing a resignation letter to party headquarters,&rdquo; Kibira said.Bekenya cited poor coordination, poor communication and being sidelined by Jubilee Party headquarters. &ldquo;I have resigned, since I don&rsquo;t want to be answerable in case something happens during the election,&rdquo; he said.This signalled how the elections might be affected after the party polls were cancelled last week on Friday. Several aspirants in Nyeri, including Mathira MP Peter Weru, governor hopeful Cocorico Githinji, senator aspirant Wambugu Nyamu and Nyeri Town MP aspirant Patrick Ngatia have quit the party, citing shambolic elections.
