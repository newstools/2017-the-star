Some Jubilee Party aspirants in Kirinyaga county have said nominations slated for 21 April may not be free and fair. They said some officials are openly favouring some candidates. Speaking to the Star on the phone yesterday, woman representative aspirant Rose Muguchu said party&rsquo;s county chairman John Mithamo has a list of his preferred candidates. Kirinyaga Central MP hopeful Beth Ngunyi said Mithamo should either exercise fairness or relinquish his chairmanship. A video clip shows Mithamo singing alongside governor aspirant Anne Waiguru on March 24 at Sifa Gardens. They were also chanting anti-Kirinyaga governor Joseph Ndathi slogans. Mithamo was summoned by JP national officials on Thursday to respond to the complaints. &lsquo;&rsquo;I have talked with Tuju about this issue. And it is apparent some elements are planning my ouster but I am not afraid. I will be more lethal to Ndathi when I&rsquo;m not chairman. Hata mimi nina kura [I too have registered as a voter].&rsquo;&rsquo; Mithamo told the Star on the phone. On Saturday, Ndathi asked JP to ensure elections are free and fair.
