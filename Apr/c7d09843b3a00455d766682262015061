Former Home Affairs assistant minister Beatrice Kones is bracing for a tough duel in her quest to win the Bomet East parliamentary seat following the entry of her son Kevin Kipngetich.Kones, who was the former legislator of the larger Bomet constituency, is seeking the Jubilee Party ticket. Kipngetich will run on Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto&rsquo;s Chama Chas Mashinani party.Kones is the national vice chairperson for Maendeleo Ya Wanawake and the widow of the late Roads minister Kipkalya Kones. She is the front runner in the race for the Jubilee ticket and will face off with incumbent Bernard Bett, former county chief Finance officer Rose Kositany and four others.Kones has said she will not step down for her son. She has accused her political rivals of using her son to frustrate her ambitions.Speaking to the Star on Thursday, Kones expressed optimism her son would heed to her call to abandon his quest and back her.She said, &ldquo;It is unfortunate some of my political foes, led by Governor Rutto, are using my son to fight me. It is because they sense danger. They know I am threat to other competitors and since he wants someone to fly his party&rsquo;s ticket, he has endorsed him for the seat but i am not afraid of him and I know he will finally back down in my favor.&rdquo;Kones added, &ldquo;If he would have agreed to run on the Jubilee Party rather than CCM, I would have backed down. Now that he is in a different party, I will remain in the race because I do not want to betray my constituents who are fully in Jubilee. They will see me as a double agent.&rdquo;Kipngetich, who vied for the Langata ward seat in 2013, is seen as a Rutto &lsquo;project&rsquo;.Kipngetich is keen on bringing back his father&rsquo;s face in the politics of Bomet after his mother failed to recapture the seat in the last polls.&ldquo;If you people want to have another Kones, elect me as your next MP. This is the time for the youth to lead,&rdquo; he said.
