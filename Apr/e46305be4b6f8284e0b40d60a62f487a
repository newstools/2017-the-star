Art and craft is set to be reintroduced in lower primary school as the government yesterday rolled out a pilot of the new curriculum to kick off in second term.The curriculum, set to replace the 8-4-4 system, will first focus on training pre-primary and lower primary teachers.The pilot will run for six months before the government rolls out the curriculum to all schools across the country next year. Art was scrapped from the primary school curriculum in 2001. There were inadequate personnel and resources in its practice.It will make a comeback as one of the nine subjects pupils will study during their first three years of primary school. The subjects will be studied under the movement and creative activities category. The other subjects are literacy, Kiswahili, English and indigenous language activities, Maths for day-to-day living, environmental activities (science, social and agriculture activities), hygiene and nutrition, moral, religious and life skills activities.The pilot will be conducted in 470 schools across the country with 10 schools selected from each county.&ldquo;We want teachers to first learn how to handle the new models of teaching outlined in the curriculum so they can be competent,&rdquo; Julius Jwan, the director of the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development, said yesterday. At the pre-primary level, the curriculum will focus on listening and speaking skills, sign language, basic reading and writing.&ldquo;When the pupils in the pilot schools open, they should not expect anything new, but rather continue with their normal learning as teachers receive training but after receiving positive results in second and third term, we will roll it out to other schools,&rdquo; Jwan said.
