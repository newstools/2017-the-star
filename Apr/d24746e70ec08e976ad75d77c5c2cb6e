Nominated MP Isaac Mwaura on Wednesday conceded defeat after losing nominations for Ruiru Jubilee MP ticket.Mwaura garnered 4,632 votes, losing to his opponent Simon King'ara who garnered 10,900 votes. "We did our best and we live to fight for another day. We have ran the race, we have kept the faith. Victory belongs to the Lord," Mwaura said on his Facebook page.He described his bid as a debut for a person with albinism and also a youth, having run for a high level political office."This in itself has had its own challenges. It is never easy but someone had to do it. Someone had to be the first to pay the price and create a pathway of possibilities," he said.Mwaura urged his supporters to support King'ara, adding "I called him at 4.11am and congratulated him.""I wish him well in serving the people of Ruiru and wish to assure him of my full support in exercising his mandate, for leadership almost invariably, has capacity to transform society," he said.He thanked Kenyans for believing in him and standing by him."Thanks for believing in us and in me, giving your all, never doubting that indeed we stood a chance to victory," he said."We ran against candidates who had more experience and who had been on the ground for nearly 10 years doing what we did in slightly more than a year."Last week, Mwaura blamed his opponent of bruising his ear after a fracas broke out.The nominated MP posted pictures on Facebook indicating that he had bruised a left ear and the windows of his four-wheel drive vehicle shattered.Read: Mwaura discharged from hospital after 'assassination' claimsReports had earlier indicated that the wound was caused by a bullet after the MP's car was allegedly shot at.But Ruiru OCPD Isaac Thuranira dismissed the claims saying no guns were involved in the incident.Read: MP Mwaura injured during fracas with rival camp in Githurai
