Kisauni MP hopeful and businessman Ali Mbogo (pictured) has said he will defeat incumbent Rashid Bedzimba because of his focus on education development. He said he will transform Kisauni from the second worst performing constituency in education to the best in the county. &ldquo;This is the biggest constituency in Mombasa, yet it has only one polytechnic, which does not receive the support it should,&rdquo; Mbogo said. His campaign slogan is Elimu Kwanza. Mbogo said lack of education has a domino effect, leading to insecurity in Kisauni. He spoke on Wednesday while donating Sh150,000 books to Baraka Voroni Primary School in Mwakirunge. But Bedzimba is credited with building a primary school and ECD centre named after him in Junda. Bedzimba says, &ldquo;We are focused on ensuring our children are well educated by improving the existing educational facilities and coming up with well-built, modern schools.&rdquo;
