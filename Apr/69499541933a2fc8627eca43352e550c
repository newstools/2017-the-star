The Jubilee Party can only retain its tyranny of numbers if Friday&rsquo;s primaries are free and fair, Gatundu North MP Kigo Njenga (pictured) has said.Speaking in Mbichi village, the legislator said if the nominations are not well-managed, supporters of candidates who lose unfairly are not likely to turn up in August.&ldquo;Voter apathy cannot be ruled out in the August general election if the primaries lack fairness and are not done in a transparent manner. I am calling on the party stalwarts to ensure fairness in Friday&rsquo;s nomination as the victim will be none other than President Uhuru Kenyatta,&rdquo; he said.Kigo asked the party to discipline candidates trying to hoodwink voters through bribery. He called on the party to deny candidates who try to bribe voters clearance forms.&ldquo;We can only get the best leadership in all levels of government through respecting the wishes of the electorate,&rdquo; he said.Kigo said actions of violence during the nominations must be avoided at all costs. He said violence during elections deter voters from turning up as most Kenyans love peace.
