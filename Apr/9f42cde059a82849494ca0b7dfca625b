Almost all women domestic workers receive pay below the set minimum wage which does not match the work they do, a survey has found.The research by Youth Alive Kenya found that 87 per cent of workers in five informal settlements in Nairobi earn an average Sh4,864 a month.Most of the workers live in these settlements and are not satisfied with their pay. Only 12 per cent had alternative sources of income while 11 per cent said they were offered some form of additional support by their employers.In July 2015, the Ministry of Labour, Social Security and Services set the minimum wage for domestic workers at Sh10,954.More on this: To pay or not to pay your house help Sh11,000?Also read: Raila's daughter criticised over her 'Sh50,000 house-helps salary proposal'Youth Alive further reported that the house helps work an average of 13.7 hours a day and have just nine house off every week, with an average of seven days as annual leave."All these is in contravention of Employment Act (2007) that stipulates that all workers are entitled to an eight-hour work day, a 48-hour weekly off and 21-day annual leave," said programme officer and researcher Justus Muthuri."But most of them opt to stay because they have no other choice."The survey found that most of the workers were not on any social protection schemes; only five per cent of those sampled were members of NSSF. Four per cent enrolled to NHIF by themselves while 14 per cent were NHIF members through their spouses.Four in ten women house helps said they had been shouted at or denied food whereas one in 10 had been physically or sexually abused. But only a quarter of them had reported these cases, the report showed.The reports were made to police or to relatives and friends whereas those who didn&rsquo;t report the violations cited fear of repercussions by their bosses.The survey attributed this to the workers' lack of information on their rights and ignorance."Only a quarter of the respondents knew of guidelines that stipulate the number of days they are supposed to work per week. Only three in 10 were aware of the guidelines that stipulate their minimum monthly wage," the report read in part."Only one in 10 workers were aware of KUDHEIHA, the domestic workers union that advocates for their rights. KUDHEIHA was known mainly by the key informants."It was reported that the informants should create more awareness among domestic workers and educate them on the modalities of being members.The survey sampled women domestic workers in Mukuru, Kibera, Korogocho, Mathare and Kawangware within Nairobi in 2015.The report from the project under the Wezesha Jamii programme was officially released on Tuesday.Also read: Is the NSSF requirement that employers enrol their househelps backed by law?
