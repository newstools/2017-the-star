An autopsy tabled before a Mombasa court on the death of Nairobi businessman Jimmy Baburam revealed he was a drug addict. Presented by lawyer Ahmednassir Abdullahi, the two reports from two hospitals in Kenya and South Africa revealed the deceased was intoxicated with alcohol and cocaine. Abdullahi informed the court this could have caused Jimmy’s death. He cross-examined Jimmy’s father David Baburam during the hearing of a case in which Amina Shiraz was charged with killing him. Shiraz is David’s daughter-in-law. The matter was being heard before Justice Dorah Chepkwony. David informed the court he treated Shiraz like his daughter and that their relationship was cordial. The court was also told the deceased had suffered several seizures which made him collapse. “It is revealed in the doctor’s report that there was a history of alcohol abuse,”Abdullahi said. Shiraz, through her lawyer, told the court the deceased was a “dead man walking” and was suffering from a “cocktail of diseases”. In the autopsy report, the doctor revealed the deceased had no visible injuries and his internal organs were also intact. David denied he is fighting Shiraz to get full ownership of the property left by his son. Shiraz is charged with the murder of Jimmy on July 26, 2015 at Medina Palms Resort. She was released on a Sh10 million bond and was ordered to deposit her passports with the court.
