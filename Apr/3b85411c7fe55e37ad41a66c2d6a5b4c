I will continue to serve my people,&rdquo; he said. Obura said his opponents should show the people of Kisumu Central what they have done.&ldquo;Some of them who had the guts to tell us that we can&rsquo;t get the presidency are also here and they want to unseat me, yet they even bought and burnt our people&rsquo;s national IDs in Mamboleo in 2013, thinking that people can forget such,&rdquo; he said.Obura said stringent measures have been put in place to ensure the primaries will be free and fair. &ldquo;I have no reason complain, because the party has assured me of free and fair nominations and my opponents should know that I will win with a landslide,&rdquo; he said.
