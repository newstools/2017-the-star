The Nairobi All Share rose a marginal +0.13 of a point to close at 131.32. The NSE20 firmed 4.29 points to close at 3101.12Nation Media Group reported full year 2016 earnings at the Sarova Stanley yesterday morning. FY 2016 earnings per share declined -25% on the back of an eight per cent full year revenue decline. Chief executive officer Joe Muganda said &ldquo;It&rsquo;s tough in as far as advertising is concerned; and the reason is simple:The economy isn&rsquo;t doing well&rdquo;.NTV booked a +7% year on year revenue gain, Business Daily eked out a 1% year on year revenue gain, whilst the flag-ship Daily Nation was -6%, Daily Monitor -20%, Mwananchi -23% and NTV Uganda -29%. Digital revenue [towards which NMG has pivoted] was +14% which looks lackadaisical. Nation Media maintained its full year dividend pay out of 10/= and is paying a final dividend of 7.50 a share. The dividend pay-out is 112.35% of the full year earnings per share. Nation stamped down hard on costs which were -22% year-on-year. Its been a torrid year for the media industry and headline growth has been hard to find but they have evidently done some heavy lifting in right-sizing the business as evidenced by the -22% year-on-year reduction in full year costs. Nation retreated -3.157% to close at Sh92.00 on light trading of 10,300 shares. NMG is -1.075% through 2017 and the final dividend is worth 12.26% on the closing price which will underpin the share price.Safaricom was the most actively traded counter at the Nairobi Securities Exchange and closed unchanged at Sh18.30 with 9.470 million shares worth Sh173.484 million traded. We learnt that the number of SMS sent from Safaricom&rsquo;s network increased to a record 15 billion messages up from 11.5 billion messages posted during the previous quarter +23.33% quarter on quarter. I recall a lot of folks pronouncing that SMS were dead and buried when WhatsApp turned up. However, I suspect the correlation is with betting and SMS blasts by the online bookmakers to their customers.Uchumi rallied +8.00% to close at Sh2.70. This up move was triggered by an interview with the `CEO Julius Kipn&rsquo;getich who confirmed that the government was all set to pony up close to Sh1.3 billion.Equity Group firmed +1,503% to close at a fresh 2017 closing high of Sh33.75. Equity is +12.5% in 2017 and buyers outpaced sellers by a factor of three versus one today. KCB Group ticked -0.74% lower to close at Sh33.75 and traded 1.749 million shares. KCB is +17.931% in 2017 and embarked on a stunning rebound after releasing its full year 2016 earnings.KenGen firmed +2.34% to close at Sh6.55 and traded 146,600 shares. PIC has been on a mopping up operation up to 6.60 and I would have thought they are close to extinguishing the supply at these levels. EABL firmed +0.44% to close at Sh227.00 on the same day that Citibank issued a Sh285.00 price target.
