Experts have called for massive awareness campaigns to control the disastrous Fall Armyworms, saying it might never be completely eliminated from Kenya.They also urged research institutions to collaborate and look for solutions to help farmers.The worm attacks more than 80 different plant species, including grass and maize, a major food staple.Researchers said the worm is favoured by the region&rsquo;s warm climate and it would be difficult to eliminate.&ldquo;We cannot eliminate the pest from Africa now that it&rsquo;s here. It will stay, but we can provide support to farmers and options to manage their crops against the Fall Armyworm,&rdquo; Boddupalli Prasanna, a director at the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre, said.He spoke at a stakeholders meeting on the Fall Armyworm in Nairobi.According to Dr Roger Day, the sanitary and phytosanitary coordinator at the Nairobi-based Centre for Agricultural and Biosciences International, a conservative estimate indicates the loss of Africa&rsquo;s maize due to the Fall Armyworm could cost the continent Sh300 billion in the coming year.Kenya&rsquo;s Agriculture ministry requires Sh420 million to fight the pest.&ldquo;The worms have now attacked about 11,000 to 15,000 hectares of land, mostly under maize,&rdquo; assistant director in charge of food crops at the ministry Clement Muyesu said.The Fall Armyworm is native to America. It is named after the time of year it does most damage &mdash; autumn &mdash; and its feeding habits, after devouring a crop the whole &ldquo;army&rdquo; advances. Scientists believe it arrived in Africa in a shipment of maize. It was first detected in West Africa in January 2016.Each adult moth lays up to 2,000 eggs during its two-week life, usually in batches of 100-200 on immature maize plants. Newly-hatched larvae often burrow into maize, before crawling to the ground to pupate. However, the experts advised farmers not to panic.&ldquo;We need to act fast, failure is not an option,&rdquo; UN Food and Agriculture Organisation country representative for Kenya Gabriel Rugalema said.Rugalema said adequate funding and a regional approach to controlling the Fall Armyworm are vital.
