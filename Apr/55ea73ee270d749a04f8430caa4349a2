Does the President&rsquo;s Statement made during the State of the Nation Address Reflect the Reality?During his State of the Nation Address, President Uhuru Kenyatta, in defense of his administration&rsquo;s stand on devolution, said that it has increased the percentage of shareable revenue going to counties from 15 percent to 34 percent. PesaCheck, with input from the International Budget Partnership (Kenya), finds the claim to be partly true. We present our facts below: The Constitution on revenue sharingArticle 202 provides for the equitable sharing of national revenue between the national and the county governments. The revenue raised at the national level is shared equitably between both levels of government. The share for counties is unconditional and is usually referred to as the &ldquo;equitable share.&rdquo; The counties can spend their equitable share without any restrictions from the national government.The county governments can also receive additional revenue from the national government&rsquo;s share, which comes in the form of conditional grants. These allocations have a restriction on their usage and the counties cannot divert the funds to other areas of expenditure.The Division of Revenue Act (Article 218) divides the equitable share of revenue between both levels of government. It is prepared every year by the National Treasury and approved by Parliament. The equitable share of revenue that goes to the counties each year should not be less than 15 per cent of the revenue collected by the national government based on the most recent audited accounts approved by the National Assembly&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;Article 203 (2) &amp; (3). The president makes reference to this figure, which he claims his government has increased to 34 per cent.Money allocated to counties between 2013/14&ndash;2016/17 as a percentage share of the last audited (and approved) accountsFrom the table above, we can see that the counties received KSh210 billion, KSh240 billion, KSh276.4 billion and KSh301.9 billion respectively for the 2013/14, 2014/15, 2015/16 and 2016/17 financial years. These shareable revenues are inclusive of both the equitable share and the conditional grants. The amounts stated above are based on the most recent audited revenue accounts approved by Parliament. For 2013/14 financial year, the accounts used were for 2010/2011 (KSh608.1 billion), but which had not been approved by Parliament. For the 2014/15, 2015/16, and 2016/17 financial years, the approved accounts used were for 2009/10 (KSh529.3 billion), 2012/13 (KSh716.9 billion), and 2013/14 (KSh935.65 billion) respectively.We can also see the county shareable revenue as a percentage of the last audited revenue for each of the four financial years. The percentages and the average are above the 34 per cent as stated by the President, except for the current financial year 2016/17. County shareable revenue as a percentage share of the projected revenueFor the 2013/14, 2014/15, 2015/16 and 2016/17 financial years, the shareable revenue (projected revenue) was KSh936 billion, KSh1038 billion, KSh1242.7 billion and KSh1380.2 billion respectively. We can see that the county shareable revenue as a percentage of the projected revenue ranges between 20 to 23 per cent and averages at 22.4 per cent. The projected shareable revenue is the revenue that the national and the county governments get to share out in a particular financial year and is not determined by the last audited accounts.The county revenue share as a percentage of the projected revenue increased from 22.4 per cent in the 2013/14 financial year to 23.1 per cent in the 2014/15 financial year. However, it declined in the 2015/16 and 2016/17 financial years to 22.2 per cent and 21.9 per cent respectively. Where the differences are coming from?First, in both cases, we made the assumption that the President referred to the equitable share and the conditional grants as part of the shareable revenues. That is why we included both in our calculations.The second assumption is that the President did not refer to the 34 per cent as an average, but as a measure of how much the counties are getting today. If we interpret the President&rsquo;s claim as as a statement about the average, then it would be true. But as a claim about the current allocation (the 32 per cent), it is false. Therefore, our verdict on the claim is partly true.When we calculate the county shareable revenue using the last audited accounts, we are basing the share of revenue for the counties on rather old figures, which tend to make the percentage of revenue that the counties receive seem higher than it is in reality. When we base the equitable share of revenue on the projected revenues, it provides a more realistic picture on the amount of revenue that each level of government should receive, although projected revenue may not be fully realized each year. Still, the projected revenues give a better sense of relative shares between both levels of government.
