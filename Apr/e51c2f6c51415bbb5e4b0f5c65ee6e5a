South Mugirango MP Manson Nyamweya, who is seeking to be Kisii governor, has warned his opponents to rule him out at their own peril.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not gambling, I will win this seat decisively, and I have the energy to drive my campaigns. I faced a bigger challenge in the 2010 by-election when the entire government campaigned against me and I won,&rdquo; he said. Nyamweya ditched ODM for KNC.The KNC leader will battle it out with incumbent James Ongwae (ODM), Kisii Senator Chris Obure (Jubilee Party), Lumumba Nyaberi (Wiper) and Boniface Omboto of Maendeleo Chap Chap. Senator Obure will faceoff with Alfred Nyangweso in today&rsquo;s JP nominations for governor.Nyamweya said he has picked a new running mate after Amasago Secondary School principal Innocent Mogunde declined to be his number two.The MP spoke to reporters in Kisii on Monday.He took a swipe at Ongwae and Obure saying they have done little in the past four years they have been in office.&ldquo;I have improved roads in the constituency. When I came to office, there was no tarmac road. All roads are now motorable. I have also improved infrastructure in schools,&rdquo; Nyamweya said.&ldquo;Let Ongwae account for the money for roads and water he has received from the national government.&rdquo;Ongwae downplayed Nyamweya&rsquo;s bid saying his main opponent is Obure. Speaking in Nakuru a week ago, Ongwae said his rivals are being driven by selfish motives.
