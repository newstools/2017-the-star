Recurrent drought in arid and semi-arid regions of Kenya is now forcing pastoralists to abandon livestock in favour of irrigation farming.The Dololomide Farm Group in Sankuri, Garissa county, is now practising sorghum farming after losing livestock to drought. The group is comprised of 60 members. Chairman Hassan Mohamed said the members realised it is impossible to recover their lost herd.&ldquo;We decided that instead of waiting for handouts from the government, we try our hand in irrigation farming. And with the support of relevant agencies we are slowly but surely succeeding,&rdquo; he said.Garissa county National Drought Management Authority coordinator Abdinoor Dubow took journalists on a tour of the farm. The sorghum planted three months ago in one acre is ready for harvesting. He said the project is a partnership between the NDMA, the department of agriculture, irrigation and fisheries and the farming community. The department of agriculture provides the technical services and logistics, while the NDMA coordinates activities.Dubow said the county is classified as food insecure because it receives 280mm of rain in two seasons combined.&ldquo;This cannot support the generation of the preferred maize,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;As the lead agencies involved in food security, we put our heads together and agreed that the only way we can engage the farmers is by urging them to venture into sorghum because it is drought tolerant.&rdquo;He said the county has been depending on relief food. &ldquo;This project will demonstrate to the farming community and other stakeholders that we need to move away from relief dependency syndrome and become food secure,&rdquo; Dubow said.County director of agriculture Jelle Ibrahim said the programme is a &ldquo;resilience building project&rdquo;. &ldquo;The objective is to build the resilience of farmers and provide market and build capacity of smallholder farmers.&rdquo;
