The Ethics and Integrity Institute has partnered with the Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry to fight corruption both in the private and public sectors.This is in the wake of increased corruption cases in government ministries and sourcing for government tenders by the private sector, with corruption blamed for contributing to 75 per cent of the cost of doing business.Corruption has also been blamed for the ballooning public debt which the National Treasury has projected could hit Sh3.77 trillion by end of this financial year on June 30.&ldquo;Business people are faced with serious threats if they do not maintain ethical standards. There is higher competition and more demand for value and accountability hence the need to address the declining ethics phenomenon in institutions,&rdquo; Ethics and Integrity Institute, Execute Director of Jacky Nyandeje (pictured) said. KNCCI acting national vice chairman James Mureu said the chamber has begun profiling companies named in corruption deals, where already 20 have been listed.This comes after the chamber took business entities to task in signing an ethics commitment last year, in its quest to fight corruption.&ldquo;We are now profiling. If your company has been caught you will be locked out of business opportunities,&rdquo; Mureu said, &ldquo;An upwards of 20 companies will be blacklisted.&rdquo;
