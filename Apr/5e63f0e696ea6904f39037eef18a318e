Supporters of losers in today’s Jubilee Party nominations have been urged to remain calm. Kiambu Senator Kimani Wamatangi has urged politicians not to incite their supporters. He said the party’s wish is to conduct a free and fair exercise. “When someone fails to accept results, their supporters feel bad and turn on their opponents’ supporters and chaos erupts. We must be very careful,” he said. Wamatangi was speaking in Limuru town on Wednesday when he wrapped up his campaign. He urged residents to come out in large numbers to nominate their preferred candidates. “A lot of aspirants want to be nominated in different seats, and each aspirant has his and her supporters. We must remain calm and accept the results if they lose fairly,” Wamatangi said.
