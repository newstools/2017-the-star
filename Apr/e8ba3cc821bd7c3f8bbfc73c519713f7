The value of property and debts from former local authorities transferred to counties is yet to be established as governors' first term in office lapses on August 8.Counties have until June 30 to ensure assets and liabilities worth billions of shillings acquired are "identified, verified and validated" before governors exit office, according to March gazette notice. "The actual cost of both assets and liabilities are still unknown until forensic audit is undertaken to verify the same. Unaudited data collected from available records of the defunct local authorities indicate that total liabilities amounts to Sh66,455,118,197," reads a statement from the Council of Governors.The defunct Transition Authority chaired by Kinuthia Wamwangi, handed unaudited list of all assets and arrears of local authorities to the Intergovernmental Relations Technical Committee to resolve outstanding issues before transferring to county governments on March 27, 2013.The assets were, however, transferred to respective county governments on an "as is, where is" basis, hence their exact value could not be ascertained.A statement from CoG's communications director Andrew Teyie states that an inter-agency team's regional induction for county assets and liabilities committees to do the audit began last Monday and ended on Saturday."To meet the timelines as provided by the legal notice, about 40 county governments have established the committees," Teyie said.The inter-agency team put in place guidelines, principles, appeals, monitoring and control mechanisms to audit the assets and debts.Meanwhile, 1,400 laws that county assemblies passed in the last four years are set for publication at the Government Press after they were aligned to the High Court order. The order poked holes in legality of some laws put in the Kenya Gazette. Teyie said a meeting between governors, Government Press officers, County Assemblies Forum representatives, Intergovernmental Relations Technical Committee, Society of Clerks at the Table and Office of Controller of Budget saw them agree on having the laws published. "The Interior ministry and the Attorney General&rsquo;s office have no supervisory role over the publication of county legislation, therefore consent from them is not required. This applies to other agents of the national government. Counties are only required to provide an authentic velum," he said.
