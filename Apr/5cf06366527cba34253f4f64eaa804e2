It&rsquo;s &lsquo;party time&rsquo; as political parties pick their &lsquo;best&rsquo; men and women for the General Election.But if what we have witnessed so far is anything to go by, we still have a long way to go to ensure democratic values take root at the party level.A party ticket in some places is literally a direct ticket to governorship, National Assembly, Senate or county assembly,and contestants stop at nothing to secure it.It is, therefore, quite unfortunate when a party gets it wrong at the primaries and citizens end up with the wrong choice &mdash; because some candidatesare better at rigging and stuffing ballot boxes than their opponents.Jubilee&rsquo;s proposal for the IEBC help run primaries should have been adopted.Though struggling with its own credibility issues, the IEBC is definitely better placed to conduct primaries than hand-picked party officials with huge vested interests in the outcome.Our democracy will only strengthen if we get it right in party primaries.
