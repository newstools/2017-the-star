Kenya&rsquo;s private sector has opened fresh talks with Tanzania in a fresh bid to convince the least-developed East African Community peer to sign the stalled trade deal with 28-member European Union.The Kenya Private Sector Alliance has entered into a partnership with the Tanzania Private Sector Foundation to discuss regional and international trade, among key issues being the Economic Partnership Agreement between the region and the European Union.The partnership was entered into last Friday, Kepsa business regulatory environment consultant Patrick Tonui said yesterday.&ldquo;We want to look at how we can support trade between us and the international markets. In our discussion, they (TPSF) recognised that this is a conversation they need to have in Tanzania, and they are having it,&rdquo; Tonui said during the Kepsa&rsquo;s quarterly media briefing in Nairobi.Tanzania is perceived to be the stumbling block in the deal which gives the region quota-free and duty-free market access to the EU. Only Kenya and Rwanda have signed and ratified the EPA deal. Uganda has shown intentions to signs, according to East African Affairs Principal Secretary Betty Maina.Tanzania has declined to sign the pact twice in 2014 and 2016, saying it will hurt the growth of her industries. Burundi on the other hand cited the wavering diplomatic relations with the EU which came after President Pierre Nkurunziza re-election bid.Kepsa however believes that private sector intervention in all EAC member states will lead to the conclusion of the deal.&ldquo;We want our country to grow and we think all our partner states are of the same opinion so they will need to change how they do trade with Europe and other states, and they cannot always depend on being least development countries to access these markets,&rdquo; Tonui said.Tanzania is riding on its LDC status to access the EU market under the Everything But Arms initiative.&ldquo;We are optimistic that we should all be signing but from our part here in Kenya we know that this is the path that we are going,&rdquo; Tonui said.
