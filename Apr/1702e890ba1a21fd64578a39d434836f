The voter register audit underway by KPMG will focus on five areas as it seeks to eliminate flaws.They include review of the legal framework and analysis of data provided by the IEBC. This will involve matching the data with third party documents from other stakeholders.KPMG will also review processes and systems leading to production of the voter register, report exemptions and make recommendations.The opposition has warned that the register is badly flawed, filled with inconsistencies, double use of IDs and passport numbers and IDs of the dead &mdash; a recipe for rigging.KPMG chief executive Josphat Mwaura on Thursday said the firm will review the register of voters against certified data on national IDs and passports provided by the Registrar of Persons and the Immigration director.&ldquo;After the review of a framework we will also audit systems for voter registration. This will entail registration posts and registration officers at the local, regional and national level,&rdquo; Mwaura said in Nairobi.The exercise started on April 5 and is expected to last 30 days. The IEBC will present the register to the National Assembly within 14 days after it has been produced by KPMG.It is required to implement the recommendations within 30 days.Mwaura said the firm is keen to analyse inclusiveness based on recorded data on gender, minority groups, age and geographical position.&ldquo;At the end of this process, we will provide to the IEBC a report of the audit that includes recommendations to enhance the accuracy of the register, thus ensuring a clean list,&rdquo; he said.Mwaura added the exercise will be conducted in reference to documents provided by the IEBC and will entail only a valid register.&ldquo;We are working with only one register as it has been presented to us by the IEBC. The law has changed and we no longer have what we used to call the principal register of voters. We have the voter register and only IEBC is mandated to have it,&rdquo; he said.The firm will use the voter register used in 2013, continuous registration details and the mass voter registration lists.The IEBC is expected to present the register to the public for verification 90 days before the elections.
