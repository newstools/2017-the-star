Lari resident Peter Kimani said Kahangara repaired classrooms, improved education standards and roads, relocated dispensaries and improved access to water, but he never campaigned.&ldquo;We were shocked because aspirants were travelling all over the constituency seeking support but our MP was expecting us to nominate him automatically,&rdquo; Kimani said. Mburu said residents wanted a change in leadership and representation. He promised to develop the constituency further.&ldquo;Constituents should expect a lot from my administration. I will work together with the government, and no one should be worried because residents wanted an approachable leader,&rdquo; he said. MCA Joseph Githaiga (Kirenga) lost to Joseph Karichu, while Mwangi Gakobo (Kijabe) lost to Nyutu Wamwea and Njuguna Mureithi (Kinale) to Dominic Mugo.
