I will not sit down with anyone and will not go back to the elections again. I am not ready to talk to him (Kamanda). Democracy is not about negotiation," Jaguar said.Kamanda had earlier said he was ready to dialogue with the musicians."It's not about me, it's about starehe people. Kama Kamanda andhani nataka niwe nominated (if Kamanda thinks I want to be nominated), he is mistaken. It has been a very difficult time for me," Jaguar said.Jaguar said Kamanda should step down for him since he won fairly."We are not stupid ... Tangu lini wazee wakaanza kuwaibia watoto wao? Na kama anasema mimi ni mtoto wake basi aniheshimu," he said.(Since when did the old start stealing from their children. And if he says I am his child then he should respect me.)Read: Singer Jaguar joins Boniface Mwangi in Starehe MP race, starts campaignsDuring the primaries, there were reports that Jaguar was tipped to win the Jubilee ticket.The musician's supporters refuted the results accusing Kamanda of rigging out his opponent in the election to get flag bearer for August."We expected Jaguar to win. There is massive rigging here," one of them was heard saying as police moved in to break the crowd.
