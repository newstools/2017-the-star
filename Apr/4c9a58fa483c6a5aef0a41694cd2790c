The Cherangany water tower in Trans Nzoia county has been undergoing rehabilitation after years of wanton destruction, but now disputes between residents and the Kenya Forest Service over exploitation of forest resources are threatening to reverse the gains made.Embobut, Kipkunur and Kapcherop forests form the 65,000-hectare water tower, which is the source of rivers in Elgeyo Marakwet, Trans Nzoia, Turkana, Uasin Gishu and West Pokot counties.The worsening hostilities culminated in the burning down of two KFS camps this month in Kapyego area near the Embobut forest.On April 2 at 7.30pm, as KFS rangers in Tangul and Kipsiton KFS stations braved the cold weather, irate residents invaded. They razed the two camps and a vehicle belonging to the service, as rangers ran for their lives. A motorcycle and a car belonging to a chief were also burnt during the incident.It became apparent that the locals were not pleased with KFS, the organisation charged with managing and conserving state forests.DISPUTE HISTORY The Sengwer, a minority hunter-gatherer community whose members have lived in the forest since time immemorial, were flushed out in 2013 and offered Sh410,000 compensation by the state.At least 2,900 squatters were evicted and compensated. The payout was to help the Sengwers, who are related to the Ogiek of Mau forest, to buy alternative land and bid farewell to forest life.Paul Kiptuga, a resident of Tangul and a Sengwer community spokesman, says the camp was razed after KFS wardens manning the two camps attacked and seriously wounded Elias Kibiwott, 38, who was taking photos of Embobut forest..Kiptuga claims KFS wardens have blatantly been beating up residents living near the forest for the past few weeks.He says trouble started when members of the community opposed a Sh2 billion funding to KFS by the European Union.The EU funds, he says, were meant for conservation of the forest.&ldquo;Members of the Sengwer community wrote to the EU to halt the funding. They wanted the community to be consulted before the funds are released. KFS was seemingly angered by the move and started harassing residents,&rdquo; Kiptuga says.The community spokesman says the EU heeded their call and halted the funds release during a meeting with residents in Tangul.&ldquo;As a community, we can&rsquo;t stop relying on the forest for pasture and honey. We were born and brought up in the forest,&rdquo; Kiptuga said.He accuses the KFS of burning down three houses belonging to residents in the area in recent days in the escalating hostilities.ARBITRARY ARRESTSVillagers living near the forest use the pasture-rich state resource as grazing land for their cattle, sheep, goats and donkeys.Jacob Kirop, a 70-year-old elder in Tangul, says the rangers are unfriendly and undiplomatic.&ldquo;We graze our animals in this forest but we feel disturbed by KFS actions. They confiscate our milk, make arbitrary arrests and charge hefty fines at their camps,&rdquo; Kirop says.He criticised the KFS for assaulting Kibiwott, saying he normally takes photos of the forest while visiting with tourists who come to watch rare species of monkeys and birds.The elder further accused KFS rangers of flushing out local herders while allowing herders from neighbouring West Pokot to graze their animals in Embobut forest.&ldquo;These constant harassments have made locals living near the forest angry. They feel discriminated against by the government,&rdquo; Kirop says.Resident Simon Kibet said KFS rangers carry out selective arrests and detention of locals.&ldquo;They discriminate a lot. You may be carrying pangas to the forest in a group. They can decide to arrest some people in the group for attempting to cut down trees and leave out others,&rdquo; Kibet says.A similar incident happened at a KFS camp in Kessup KFS camp, Keiyo North, last year, following a dispute with residents.One person who was illegally transporting timber was shot dead during the October incident.Many residents in Tangul and Kipsiton speak about the burning of the stations in low tones.They tell the Star KFS rangers are feared because of their harsh treatment of residents.&ldquo;KFS rangers think we are planning to resettle in the forest. That&rsquo;s far from the truth. No one wants to go back to the forest. You can even see for yourself that there are no houses in the forest,&rdquo; a resident only identified as Kipchumba says.North Rift KFS regional manager Stephen Chesa led a team of the service&rsquo;s officials from Nairobi to the scene, but left without speaking to the press.The rangers in the ill-fated camps were moved to a nearby Kapyego KFS stations.&lsquo;RIGGED&rsquo; COMPENSATIONResidents of Embobut criticised the compensation of squatters and indigenous communities who lived in the forest&rsquo;s glades since 1930&rsquo;s, saying genuine squatters were not offered the Sh410,000 payout.Evictee Emmanuel Kisang, now living in the landslide-prone escarpment in Chawis, said he was shocked after he and his family could not find their names in the compensation list after they were flushed out of the forest in January 2013.&ldquo;It was a big disappointment that people who were not living in the forest were compensated and evictees left out. We are appealing to the government to audit the list of evictees,&rdquo; the father of six says.&ldquo;It was astonishing to realise that our own names were deleted and replaced with strangers. The compensation turned out be a scam.&rdquo;Samuel Lelmengit says the Sengwer community was given preferential treatment in the compensation.&ldquo;Almost all members of the Sengwer community were compensated. The government assumed that they were the genuine squatters,&rdquo; he says.He added: &ldquo;Our houses had been reduced to ashes a record 21 times by Kenya Forest Service wardens. We were finally fluhed out in 2013.&rdquo;Weiwe village elder William Komen, 75, says some powerful individuals seized the opportunity to benefit themselves and their cronies.He cites Kipchumwa area, where he says over 200 names were struck out of the payout list.He says landslide victims were not categorised as forest evictees and thus could not qualify for the allocation.The elder says hundreds of families found themselves in the forest after they were evacuated in the early 1960s to safer grounds from the landslide-prone escarpments.Embobut MCA Simeon Chebii agrees that several evictees were left out in the compensation.FOREST RETURN BIDIn December 2015, KFS dispatched more wardens to guard Embobut forest, following demands by the Sengwer community to return to the forest.Former Marakwet KFS zonal manager Alfred Nyaswabu said the hunter-gather communities were slowly returning to the forest, a move he said was threatening conservation.He said members of the Sengwer community have demanded to be allowed to settle in the forest, despite being compensated by the government.The manager said the evictees may have squandered their compensation money.&ldquo;They did not buy alternative land, despite being compensated,&rdquo; Nyaswabu said.Members of the community say their culture does not allow them to live outside the forest.One of them, Michael Kimaiyo, says the community&rsquo;s livelihood depends on forests.He defends the community against claims that it has destroyed the water tower, saying the indigenous community does not cut down trees, but protects them for production of honey and natural fruits.&ldquo;It is true that members of the community were compensated. KFS wardens have been destroying their houses for decades but no one has compensated them, yet they don&rsquo;t destroy the forest,&rdquo; Kimaiyo says.The community&rsquo;s persistence on returning to the forest played out during a meeting presided over by National Lands Commission chairman Muhammad Swazuri in November last year in Tangul, Marakwet East.Swazuri gave a 14-day notice to residents who have resettled in gazetted forest lands to move out or face arrests.Swazuri&rsquo;s remarks infuriated hundreds of residents who had turned up at the baraza hoping to be allowed to move back to the forest, leading to a massive walkout that left the chairman with a few community leaders.He said the residents had no valid reason to return after receiving their payouts in 2013.&ldquo;It is illegal for you to return to the forest. But you can graze your livestock, harvest honey and fetch firewood in the forest,&rdquo; Swazuri said.Residents, who were members of the Sengwer community, insisted that they should be allowed to return and use the forest to graze their animals. Joseph Kaptuka, 65, said members of the Sengwer community have petitioned the government to let them resettle in the forest, which is their ancestral home.&ldquo;We attended meetings in Nanyuki and Naivasha and developed a roadmap for us to go back to the forest, but KFS officers are still harassing us,&rdquo; Kaptuka said.He wondered why NLC was ordering the community to keep off the forest, yet it had agreed to allow the minority community to use it for economic activities without cutting down trees.
