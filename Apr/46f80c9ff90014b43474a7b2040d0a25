A 27-year-old man went from one unhappy marriage to another for years after suffering an abnormal condition that made it difficult for him to sire children.Mvuko Mwando, a palm wine tapper from Bwagamoyo in Rabai constituency, Kilifi county, had also lost hope of ever producing a child and to be called a father.Three of his marriages ended unceremoniously for what the wives termed as misfortune of staying with a man who could not sire children.Little did he know that he was a victim of oligospermia until recently when it dawned on him that the problem had affected his reproductive organs.Oligospermia, sometimes called oligozoospermia, is a male fertility issue, where there are fewer sperm than normal in a man&rsquo;s semen.It is more plainly referred to as low sperm count.Initially Mwando thought he was healthy and since he could produce sperms during sexual intercourse with his wife, there was no reason why the wife could not conceive a child.It did not take long as the first wife divorced him, went to remarry with another man and surprisingly, she gave birth within a short period.The same problem occurred with the second wife, and due to lack of children, she abandoned him, went and got married elsewhere.Mwando&rsquo;s second wife also gave birth in the second marriage.&ldquo;I thought the problem was with the wife all through. It did not dawn on me that I was the one lacking something," he said.The tapper is not the only man suffering oligospermia, there could be many others suffering silently without knowing it&rsquo;s the problem.SIX-MONTH DOSEI met Mwando on January 9 at Makini Herbal Clinic, Mombasa, a renowned herbal facility operated by Dr Isaac Magige, a renowned herbalist.Mwando was accompanied by his wife Janet Mwadziwe, who I came to learn was his third wife.With them was baby Elias Mvuko, one-and-a-half months old, who looked healthy.It was easy to tell from Mvuko&rsquo;s face that he was not the same, as he kept smiling while staring at the child.At the Makini Herbal Clinic, situated at a hotel building on Haile Selassie Avenue, there were three other couples with young children and other patients who had come for normal checkups.One could easily tell that the clinic was among the best-rated herbal medicine institutions.A happy Dr Magige announced at the waiting bay that it was a great day for the Makini Herbal Clinic family, as they were celebrating lives of newborn babies from parents who had earlier suffered from oligospermia.He invited a pastor for prayers then introduced journalists to the families, including Mwando.&ldquo;I thank God for giving me these blessings. This couple came with problems of delivery. After tests I found out that the mother was okay, but the father had oligospermia," he said.The doctor initiated treatment and after completing the dose, which last six months, the wife became pregnant.Dr Magige says men with similar problems should not stay at home, as oligospermia can be treated.According to him, some men have few sperms or oligospermia, while others have none or azoospermia, in medical terms.&ldquo;Those who are told they do not have sperms usually panic, not knowing they can be treated," he says.The doctor says many patients have a problem of not following the doctor&rsquo;s instructions. Some drink alcohol, which one is not supposed to when under oligospermia medication.To him, it's only women who follow instructions.Inside the clinic, there are many photos of couples who got children after undergoing treatment successfully for six months .Mvuko said his wife conceived after five-month medication, as they were both strictly following the doctor&rsquo;s instructions.&ldquo;Many people were complaining to me," he said. "My wives also had stomachaches. It's only my third wife who told her parents about the problem and after medication, they are now happy."For Mvuko, he has suffered psychologically for years, and having a newborn child now did not only bring light from darkness but also gave him hope of having a family of his own.CAUSESWhile semen can have varying concentrations of sperm, a normal ejaculate may contain between 40 million and 300 million sperm per milliliter of semen.A man is diagnosed with oligospermia if he has a concentration of less than 15 million sperm per milliliter of semen.&ldquo;In a case of severe oligospermia, a man's semen will have a concentration of less than 5 million sperm per milliliter. The total absence of sperm in semen is called azoospermia," a study says.It also reveals that low sperm count can be a problem if a couple wishes to get pregnant, because having fewer sperm decreases the odds that one of the sperm will fertilise the woman&rsquo;s egg naturally.The low sperm count is reportedly caused by factors including varicoceles (swollen testicular veins), infections of the male reproductive organs and some sexually transmitted diseases, such as gonorrhea and chlamydia.Other causes are ejaculation problems, such as retrograde ejaculation, defects of the immune system that cause your body to attack sperm, tumours, hormone imbalances, chromosome defects (such as Klinefelter&rsquo;s syndrome), celiac disease and certain medications.It could also arise due to prior surgeries or injuries, exposure to industrial chemicals, heavy metals, or radiation, drug, alcohol or tobacco use, obesity and stress.However, most people reportedly suffer silently, not knowing they have that condition and that it can be cured.Experts say diagnosis of oligospermia is done by semen analysis.&ldquo;This is a procedure where a man provides a semen sample, which is then analysed by a lab to determine sperm concentration, motility, morphology, and other factors affecting fertility,&rsquo;&rsquo; added the report, which explained in detail about oligospermia.Dr Magige says his clinic normally has medication, which if properly followed can help one heal and get children.It is for that reason that in January, there were newborn babies who flocked the Makini Herbal Clinic born from parents who initially had oligospermia.FEMALE INFERTILITYFanis Dan a resident of Kombeni, had a problem with her left ovaries and fibroids, which made it difficult for her to get a child for 15 years.After visiting Makini Herbal Clinic, she managed to get children and have now two children without undergoing surgery.The firstborn Emmanuel Dan is two years and seven months old, and the second born, who was also present, is now six months old.&ldquo;Neighbours had said I would not get a child. I prayed to God and asked him to give direction on the way to go," she says.Rehema Katana, another victim from Likoni, had fibroids and could not get children for two years.One day she was listening to radio and heard that Makini Herbal Clinic could cure her.After visiting the clinic, she was given medication that lasted six months and she healed.She now has a bouncing baby girl, Blessings Pendo.Katana did not have to go for operation and now has completely gotten well.&ldquo;I had been told to undergo surgery but now I'm happy because I'm back to normal and blessed with a child," she says.Dr Magige said he was happy to help not only those suffering from oligospermia but even many others with different ailments using herbal medicine.He says some ailments, which require surgery, can be treated using their tested herbal medicine and heal.TREATMENT OPTIONSResearch indicates that once a man has oligospermia, the medical treatment options depend on whether or not the cause of the low sperm count can be determined.&ldquo;If an injury is causing the problem, for instance, there may be reconstructive surgery that can restore normal functionality of the reproductive organs. If an infection is at fault, antibiotics may help,&rsquo;&rsquo; the report says.The study says if the cause is not immediately obvious or is something that is difficult to treat, the couple may try ICSI (intracytoplasmic sperm injection).This is a procedure that involves injecting a single good-quality sperm collected from the man directly into an egg collected from the woman, and then implanting the resulting embryo in the woman&rsquo;s uterus. The couple may also use donor sperm.For Doctor Magige, such options may turn out to be quite expensive for the common people suffering out there and may be difficult for them to afford. He urges them to be open to herbal solutions.
