The Kakamega assembly leaders have accused Governor Wycliffe Oparanya of inciting MCAs against the assembly service board over control of funds.Minority leader Titus Kwomah yesterday said Oparanya asked MCAs to reverse the assembly development budget.&ldquo;He is asking MCAs to pass a supplementary budget, shifting the Sh100 million meant for the construction of a new assembly chambers to the executive. In return, some MCAs have been given contracts while others have been promised,&rdquo; Kwomah said.The Sh500 million chamber has been at the centre of controversy between the assembly and the executive.The project was allocated Sh300 mill in the current budget, but was slashed to Sh100 million in a supplementary budget.Kwomah said Oparanya&rsquo;s scheme is being headed by the assembly budget committee chairman Bernard Lukulu, who he says has been awarded tenders by the executive.But the governor through his head of communication Sumba Juma said the county legislature and the executive have separate development budgets.Juma said the executive wants to reallocate the Sh100 million because the cash was lying idle.&ldquo;The money was meant for the chambers, but it was discovered the land that was earmarked for the project had been sold to a private developer making it difficult to proceed with the project,&rdquo; he said.Juma said no MCA had been given contracts by the executive as claimed by Kwomah.But Kwomah said Oparanya was scheming to frustrate the construction of the new chambers so that his office controls the project and not the assembly service board.
