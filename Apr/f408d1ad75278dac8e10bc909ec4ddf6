Tetu MP Ndung'u Gethenji's chief campaigner Fianjo Mathenge was arrested on Tuesday over a suspected plot to rig the Jubilee Party nominations.Mathenge was arrested by more than 200 Tetu residents and local leaders who handed him over to the police.The angry residents stormed the Aberdare Country Club in Nyeri on Tuesday night where Mathenge was allegedly meeting 50 presiding officers.The residents led by Jubilee aspirants Gichuhi Mwangi, Peter Kamuthu and Martin Githigaro stormed the hotel in a convoy of over 10 vehicles."The presiding officers were seen escaping towards the bush, covering their faces," a witness told the Star.The MP is also alleged to have escaped in the melee but his car was confiscated by the angry residents.They also seized photocopies of election papers.The election list per polling station showed that the MP could have garnered 23,000 more votes in the Friday primaries out of a possible 55,000 registered voters.Aspirant Mwangi said the incumbent should be disqualified from the race over election malpractice.Efforts to contact the MP were fruitless as he could not be reached on phone.The incident came just a few hours after the Jubilee National Elections Board held a meeting with the aspirants in Nyeri town.
