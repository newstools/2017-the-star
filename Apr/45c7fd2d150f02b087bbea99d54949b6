Nyeri leaders have urged the Jubilee Party National Elections Board to prepare fully for repeat polls scheduled for Wednesday.Governor Samuel Wamathai and other county leaders said the cancelled polls were a sham and the party should ensure structures are in place to ensure free and fair nominations.Wamathai questioned why there were less than half the needed ballot papers in the polling stations, despite promises of smooth elections by the party headquarters.Speaking during a press conference, the Nyeri Aspirants Forum secretary general Duncan Maina said that in repeat elections the party must ensure sufficient ballot papers, use of the current 2017 register, polling stations are opened early and ballot boxes have covers and seals.
