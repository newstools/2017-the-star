But today we stand here on the threshold of a new dawn, rewriting the history of Kenya,&rdquo; Wetangula said to the roaring and ecstatic crowd of NASA supporters who thronged Uhuru Park.The Ford Kenya leader told supporters that if they stand united, they will conquer the Jubilee administration in the August polls.&ldquo;Together nothing can stand in our way,&rdquo; he said.He said opposition opposition presidential flagbearer Raila was just the first among equals.&ldquo;He is the captain of a star-studded team, we ask each of you to go out there and get votes for NASA,&rdquo; he said.Wetang&rsquo;ula urged losers of the primaries in the affiliate NASA parties to remain in the Alliance and &ldquo;be part of a happy family&rdquo;.
