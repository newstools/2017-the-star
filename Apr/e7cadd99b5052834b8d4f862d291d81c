A case in which former Kabete MP Paul Muite was charged with stealing more than Sh24.5 million 17 years ago was yesterday withdrawn.This is after the complainants in the case made an application to withdraw the charges after Muite paid them.&ldquo;Arthi Holdings Company was purchasing the land from the American Company, which was disclosed fully to the complainant, including others who were purchasing the land,&rdquo; Muite said.&ldquo;Arthi Holdings obtained money by false pretences.&rdquo;Muite said he paid the money because he was involved as a director of Arthi Holdings and he did not want the complainants to continue to suffer.Complainants Mwana Mwireri Rironi and Naivasha Farmers Company said that Muite paid them the previous directors&rsquo; Sh8 million first and then paid the balance of Sh16 million.The case has been pending in a Nairobi court since July 1999. Muite was charged on July 23, 1999, with stealing from the complainants.The offences are said to have been committed between December 1992 and December 1993. He was also charged with obtaining money fraudulently.
