Nyandarua Governor Daniel Waithaka has asked the High Court in Nairobi to dismiss a case seeking to stop his nomination on grounds he faces unresolved public finance management issues.Petitioner Francis Kinyua, a private citizen, says allowing the governor to run without clearance would violate the Constitution. He wants a temporary injunction barring the governor, the IEBC and the Jubilee Party from presenting and accepting his nomination papers.Waithaka on Monday said he would file a response but did not elaborate. The suit was filed in Nyandarua, but has been transferred to Nairobi.Kinyua has enjoined Auditor General Edward Ouko as an interested party and annexed the report on alleged financial impropriety from 2013 to June 30, 2015, in the pleadings.The petitioner claims the audit report places the governor at the centre of unapproved expenditures, culpable as county CEO for his term in office. He says despite the audit report, the EACC has not initiated legal process and unless the court restrains the IEBC and JP from accepting the nomination papers, Waithaka will be cleared to vie.
