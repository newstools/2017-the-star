Former CCU leader Wavinya Ndeti has said Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka got consent from the party&rsquo;s National Executive Council to give her a direct nomination for Machakos governor.Ndeti said she would not have ditched CCU, where she was the party leader with a direct ticket, only to become someone&rsquo;s running mate or be subjected to primaries.&ldquo;It is unfair to expose me to nominations because in the event I lose, I will have lost twice,&rdquo; she said.Ndeti addressed rallies in Mlolongo and Athi River in Mavoko subcounty on Sunday.&ldquo;Many people wanted us to unite with Kalonzo. I sacrificed my party as its head to join Wiper because of you,&rdquo; she said.Ndeti said she is Wiper&rsquo;s candidate for Machakos governor and is ready to battle with incumbent Alfred Mutua of Maendeleo Chap Chap.Her running mate - outgoing EALA MP Peter Mathuki - maintained the party will not hold nominations for governor.He said the party has issued Ndeti a direct nomination certificate.&ldquo;We will fight for Machakos on August 8. Those who want to go to nominations should go it alone,&rdquo; Mathuki said.He said that is the position of the party and was speaking as Wiper&rsquo;s deputy secretary general.Machakos Deputy Governor Bernard Kiala had said the party would hold nominations, but in a press statement yesterday, Wiper cancelled the governor polls, saying it had gotten wind of plans to interfere with the process.Instead, the party leader called Ndeti, Mathuki and Kiala to Nairobi for a meeting to agree on the way forward. They are to &ldquo;reorganise for the nominations tomorrow or find another alternative&rdquo;.Last week, Kiala said Wiper must respect its Constitution. He welcomed Ndeti to Wiper, but said she should be ready to battle for the governor ticket.
