A petitioner seeking the legalisation of marijuana, popularly known as bhang, yesterday told a Senate committee the herb can cure up to 6,077 medical conditions.Presenting his petition before the Health committee at Parliament Buildings, researcher Gwada Ogot told chairman and Migori Senator Wilfred Machage marijuana not only has &lsquo;huge&rsquo; medicinal benefits, but also &lsquo;massive&rsquo; industrial uses. He said it is high time Kenya decriminalised it and also reviewed its plants categorisation system. Ogot termed the current system of banning marijuana &ldquo;old and outdated&rdquo;.&ldquo;The age of legal cannabis is here with us. Time based, cyclic and coincides with the age of light and knowledge. Cannabis is God&rsquo;s plant, a gift to mankind just as the many minerals he has in store for Kenya. No one can stop this,&rdquo; he said. Ogot,who made his presentation to a quiet and attentive committee, said Kenya criminalised the use of the herb because of ignorance. He said, &ldquo;This effort to legalise cannabis in Kenya is a first and conscious step towards achieving medicinal and industrial self sufficiency nationally and continentally. It is also a statement to Western nations Kenya and Africa have come of age, because it is they who precipitated the ban.&rdquo; Ogot added, &ldquo;Industrial cannabis offers Africa a comprehensive and valuable raw material base, necessary for transformation from a net consumer of imported goods and commodities to a net producer and exporter.&rdquo;To back his petition, Ogot who admitted to smoking bhang during his teenage years, said most countries in Europe and Asia as well as some states in the US have legalised the use of marijuana. He listed Colombia, Mexico, Czech Republic, Costa Rica, Ireland, Australia, Jamaica and Germany that have decrimilased the herb.Machage said the committee will investigate the matter. &ldquo;It is not the work of the Senate to criminalise your thinking,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
