Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa (pictured) has faulted the government for allowing importation of untaxed maize, saying the move will affect maize farmers in Trans Nzoia county.He said the government should regulate the imports, since countries like Uganda will export a lot of maize into the county, killing the business in Kenya.Wamalwa was reacting to the 2017-18 Budget estimates in which Treasury CS Henry Rotich said the government will remove tax for maize imports.Rotich said importation of maize in the next four months will be duty free because of the effects of drought. &ldquo;White maize will be imported on free taxes. In order to make them affordable, I propose that VAT be removed completely,&rdquo; he said.But Wamalwa said, &ldquo;Prices will fall and farmers will incur huge losses if such a move is allowed.&rdquo; &ldquo;We have purchased fertiliser at exorbitant prices and it will be difficult to get profits if the imports are not regulated.&rdquo;He spoke in Sirende on Monday.
