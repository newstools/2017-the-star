The Kenya Defence Forces on Saturday at dawn killed two al Shabaab militias in Kuday, Somalia, and recovered assorted weapons. The militants had raided Somali National Army base near KDF&rsquo;s. KDF spokesman Joseph Owuoth said Bashe Nure Hassan, an Al Shabaab commander who joined the forces several years ago, was among those killed. Scores of others escaped with injuries. &ldquo;In the subsequent engagement, Amisom/KDF supported the SNA allies using motors and machine-gun fire to scuttle the terrorists,&rdquo; Owuoth said. He said three AK47 riffles, 11 magazines and 290 rounds of ammunition and a satellite phone were recovered from the slain terrorists. No soldier in the SNA and KDF troops was injured. &ldquo;KDF soldiers remain vigilant and will continue to relentlessly pursue terrorists to ensure peace and security of our country,&rdquo; Owuoth said.
