Big political parties are still identifying candidates for the August polls. Their primaries have been largely shambolic, so much so that Jubilee was forced on Friday to cancel voting in 21 counties. ODM primaries also have been chaotic, disorganised and marred by protests. Today ODM holds primaries in its Nyanza stronghold.By now, the Orange party ought to have learnt from areas where primaries have already been conducted. That is why today&rsquo;s voting should be better managed. Stations should open very early and there should be sufficient voting materials to ensure a smooth exercise.The same applies to Jubilee. It had a long time to prepare and the whole weekend for a postmortem on what went wrong.Providing enough ballot papers in good time, opening stations early and availing the updated register are crucial. President Uhuru&rsquo;s party has a chance to redeem itself in primaries from today through Wednesday.The main parties should not let down their supporters &mdash; and the nation &mdash; again.
