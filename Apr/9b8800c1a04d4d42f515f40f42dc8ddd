Two people were yesterday arrested for distributing leaflets urging residents not to vote for a woman aspirant in Kirinyaga county. County commissioner Erastus Ekidor, in an interview with the Star, said the two are being held at the Sagana police station. A saloon car they were using has been impounded and detectives are looking for its owner.Ekidor said security will be tight and police will be deployed to all polling centres today to avert chaos during the Jubilee Party nominations. &ldquo;If anyone tries to cause violence during and after the election, we will deal with them regardless of their status,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said. Kirinyaga police boss Joseph Nthenge concurred with Ekidor, but did not divulge the number of police, citing security reasons. Ekidor said they have for the past two weeks been carrying out peace initiatives in the county.
