Campaigns for Garissa governor are getting hotter with the two main rivals &mdash; incumbent Nathif Jama and Ali Korane &mdash; sparing no time to hit at each other.The latest verbal attack was from Korane on Tuesday, who accused Jama of doing little to solve water scarcity in Garissa town.Korane and hundreds of his supporters went round Garissa town carrying empty 20litre jerricans.He said that despite the county getting huge allocations of money, it had failed to provide water even to the residents of Garissa town.&ldquo;This administration has failed to provide even the simplest of services to the people like provision of water. Our mothers and children are trekking long distances in this day and age in search of water. The situation is replicated in other major towns within the county,&rdquo; Korane said.But in a quick rejoinder, Jama accused Korane of hiring goons to block water lines and then claiming that there is not water in Garissa town and its environs.A visibly angry Jama described the move as "cheap politics" and said some culprits had already been arrested in connection to the incidences.&ldquo;That trick you are using will not take you anywhere. You cannot go round the town carrying empty jerricans and claiming that there is no water when you very well know that it's you who hired some individuals to block the same. Let us not play with people's lives. You will not get votes by applying such unorthodox means,&rdquo; he told journalists in his office.&ldquo;Residents of Garissa know how the town was a few months ago and how much we have invested in water in Garissa town through GAWASCO.&rdquo;Jama urged his opponents to conduct campaigns in a civil manner "without inciting the people or talking about non-issues as far as policies is concerned".Garissa township MP Aden Duale is not record criticising Jama for failing to address the water shortage problem and at some point said he will personally engage Water CS Eugene Wamalwa to have the problem resolved.Jama, who defeated Korane will less than 2,000 votes in 2013, will again face him in the August polls. Political observers say the contest is too close to call at the moment.
