If Jubilee is unable to prevent rigging, the power of the people will,&rdquo; Githinji said. He spoke at the Aberdare County Club on Tuesday night. Three hundred Tetu residents and and aspirants - led by Gichuhi Mwangi, Peter Kamuthu and Martin Githigaro - stormed a private club in Nyeri after receiving reports of a plot to rig.They found the 50 Tetu presiding officers having supper before being briefed by MP Ndung&rsquo;u Gethenji&rsquo;s chief campaigner and personal assistant Fianjo Mathenge.
