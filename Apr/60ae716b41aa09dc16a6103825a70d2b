Pressure is piling on the government to review last September&rsquo;s interest cap law with analysts increasingly blaming the amended legislation for slowing economic activities. The World Bank yesterday joined the growing chorus of calls for scrapping of the cap enforced to help micro- and small-sized enterprises &ndash; the drivers of Kenya&rsquo;s growth &ndash; access affordable credit.Kenya Bankers Association however said in January the Banking (Amendment) Act, 2016 &ldquo;may have had an adverse impact on micro and small businesses in terms of loan approvals and disbursements&rdquo;. &ldquo;It is unfortunate that the unintended consequence of capping of interest rates was a slowdown in lending by our commercial banks,&rdquo; President Uhuru said on March 15 during the State of the Nation Address. &ldquo;This is an issue that concerns us and is one that I am actively seeking to resolve so that credit can start to flow to the real drivers of our economy.&rdquo; Treasury CS Henry Rotich and Central Bank governor Patrick Njoroge &ndash; who both had opposed the enactment of the rate cap &ndash; pledged late last month to investigate the impact the amended law has had on borrowing. The World Bank yesterday further cut Kenya&rsquo;s growth projection by 50 basis points to 5.5 per cent from an estimated growth of 5.9 per cent in 2016.The Bretton Woods institution largely cited the capping of loan charges at four percentage points above the 10 per cent Central Bank Rate and putting a floor on interest paid on term deposits at 70 per cent of the CBR, for the downgrade. &ldquo;Kenya faces a marked slowdown in credit growth to the private sector. At 4.3 per cent, this remains well below the ten-year average of 19 per cent and is weighing on private investment and household consumption, the World Bank said in Economic Update report for Kenya. The IMF, World Bank&rsquo;s sister company, on January 25 also warned that while the limit on loan charges was manageable short-term, it could destabilise the financial services sector long-term.&ldquo;Although the adverse effects of the controls are manageable in the near term, if maintained, they could potentially pose a risk to financial stability,&rdquo; deputy managing director and acting chair Tao Zhang said in a statement. &ldquo;Therefore, it is essential to remove these controls, while taking steps to prevent predatory lending and increase competition and transparency of the banking sector.&rdquo;Analysts at FocusEconomics &ndash; a global firm that polls economists from leading banks, consultancies and think-tanks &ndash; also last month trimmed Kenya&rsquo;s growth forecast by 0.2 percentage points to 5.5 per cent.&ldquo;There is mounting evidence the interest rate cap introduced in September 2016 dampened growth in Q4 and at the start of this year,&rdquo; the firm said. &ldquo;Bank lending to the real economy has slowed down sharply, as banks restrict lending to smaller, riskier businesses&rdquo;The CBK&rsquo;s Monetary Policy Committee on March 27 said that while the growth in private sector credit has stabilised at 4.5 per cent, the share of loans to corporates has increased relative to business and personal loans.However, loan approvals declined by six per cent between December 2016 and February 2017. Private sector credit growth fell to 4.3 per cent in December 2016 compared to more than 17 per cent a year earlier, Central Bank of Kenya data show. &ldquo;Lending to micro, small, and medium enterprises has declined in value terms as reflected in reduced lending by large and medium banks,&rdquo; the MPC said
