Former Vice President Moody Awori yesterday concluded his testimony in court by saying Muchanga Investment Ltd is the rightful owner of the disputed Sh8 billion Karen land.Awori denied allegation by lawyer William Arusei, representing the wife of former Provincial Commissioner John Mburu, that Muchanga defrauded ex-PC Mburu to acquire the property. He was being cross-examined by Arusei. The former politician told trial judge Elijah Obaga of Milimani Environment and Land Court that when he was a senior civil servant, he knew Muchanga had followed all procedures in buying the land.Awori maintained he and his wife Rose Kuyumba were directors of Muchanga, when the land was transferred from Barclays Bank.And during re-cross examination by lawyers Cecil Miller and Peter Wena, representing Muchanga, the former VP maintained he attended a board of directors meeting on April 29, 1983 that resolved to charge the land with Barclays for Sh10.5 million.He identified some documents, which he produced in court, marked as evidence, to support claims by businessman Horatius Da Gama Rose, now deceased, that he bought the land from Barclays.Dimitri Da Gama Rose, a general manager with Muchanga, has since taken his father&rsquo;s place in the case.Awori said he and his wife are listed as directors of Muchanga in the minutes of the board that resolved to extend credit to its holding company, Da Gama Rose Investments.The case has previously been heard by Justice Lucy Gacheru, but has since been transferred to another station. Awori said he was not directly involved in the purchase. He, however, says the transaction was brought to their attention, and he can confirm Muchanga bought the property. The hearing continues.Barclays director of legal services Waweru Mathenge says the lender held the land title as a charge for a loan taken by Dimitri Da Gama Rose between 1983 and 1989, but it was released and he was given a certificate of discharge after he completed servicing the loan. Telesource, a company owned by former NSSF Managing Trustee Jos Konzolo, had told the court it acquired the land from Kamau, who had bought it from Arnold Bradley, the original owner, on August 24, 1978. Mathenge told the court the transfer deal between Bradley and Kamau was fraudulent.
