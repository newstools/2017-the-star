The drought cycle can only be broken through innovative solutions,the Kenya Red Cross Society said yesterday as it revised its appeal for help.The ongoing drought threatens the lives of millions of people and livestock. KRCS secretary general Abbas Gullet said the country cannot keep saying never again, yet evidence shows that drought occurs every five to six years.&ldquo;The situation is getting worse every day. Malnutrition among children is steadily climbing, children are getting sick, livelihoods of families are decimated,&rdquo; he said.About four million Kenyans are starving.Painting a grim picture, Gullet said more than 340,000 children under five years are malnourished.&ldquo;We are targetting 14 counties with emergency interventions, with those generally considered hard to reach or having limited humanitarian space being prioritised,&rdquo; he said at the KRCS headquarters in South C, Nairobi.Gullet (pictured) said specific hotspots identified by the society with the help of county steering groups were in a drought alarm phase in February.The appeal targets help, for 1,033,300 people, he said.The KRCS has revised the Sh1 billion appeal which targetted 340,786 people early this year to Sh2.5 billion.It also had another appeal for Sh383 million, in September last year.Gullet said malnutrition is above the emergency threshold of 15 per cent in many counties, with Mandera climbing catastrophically to 32 per cent.The drought cycle can only be broken through innovative solutions,the Kenya Red Cross Society said yesterday as it revised its appeal for help.The ongoing drought threatens the lives of millions of people and livestock.
