Kitui Governor Julius Malombe has told Senator David Musila to swallow his pride and honourably concede defeat.Malombe beat Musila in the Wiper ticket race for Kitui governor last week.The governor told Musila to keep Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka out of the Kitui nomination affair, saying Kalonzo did not interfere with the exercise. Malombe said Musila should stop crying foul and know that in a political duel, there must be a winner and a loser.&ldquo;I said in the past that I would beat Senator Musila at the polls. I asked him to retire from politics honourably or he would be forced to retire by the voters. This has come to pass and he must concede defeat,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why is Musila dragging Wiper leader&rsquo;s name in the Kitui governor nominations?&rdquo;Malombe said Kalonzo was busy negotiating for the NASA flagbearer&rsquo;s position to be involved in Kitui affairs. &ldquo;He could not find time to come to Kitui and meddle in the nominations as Musila claims,&rdquo; he said.Malombe spoke to the press at Kitui Kefri Centre on Friday evening.This was after Musila rejected Kitui nominations results on Thursday.The senator accused Kalonzo of being behind his loss. He resigned from the party.Musila told a press conference in Nairobi that he did not see the need to continue being the Wiper chairman.He said he would run for governor as an independent candidate.But Malombe told Musila to retire from politics as he will still lose if he insists on running for governor on August 8.&ldquo;It comes a time when older leaders, who have served their time, must honourably exit the political stage and give way to new blood. Some have already reached their sell-by date,&rdquo; the governor said.
