Cotu on Friday rejected reports attributed to FKE executive director Jacqueline Mugo that the rising minimum wage is pushing potential employers out of Kenya.In a statement, Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli said it is misleading and makes no economic sense for the Federation of Kenya Employers to claim increases have pushed up the cosst of doing business by 30 per cent.&ldquo;If at all doing business in Kenya is expensive, why not go to Rwanda, Uganda, Burundi, Ethiopia and anywhere else?&rdquo; Atwoli asked.He said Kenya is the satellite of all economic activities in the region and the headquarters of all major companies, including those in Rwanda, Ethiopia, Uganda and Malawi.Atwoli said their money is in Kenyan banks. For anyone to compare Kenya to Ethiopia, Uganda, Malawi or Egypt is a mockery of workers, he said. Kenya is way ahead of those countries, Atwaoli said.&ldquo;Most of these companies have loans from Kenyan banks, thus economies of Kenya&rsquo;s scale cannot compare with any of these countries FKE cites.What the workers are demanding is an average that can sustain them at work, not a living wage,&rdquo; he said.Atwoli said Cotu has put its demand forward and is happy with President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s announcement that he will consider its request.Don&rsquo;t take pride in paying slave wages, he told employers.
