Changamwe MP Omar Mwinyi has been summoned before the ODM justice and disciplinary tribunal over the chaos which occurred in Mombasa last Saturday during the primaries.A Mombasa court was told that Mwinyi received the summons on Tuesday evening and he should be allowed time to travel to NairobiHe will be appearing before the panel in Nairobi tomorrow afternoon. If found culpable, Mwinyi might be barred from contesting or fine of Sh1 million.Meanwhile, the court declined to grant orders to the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions to charge Mwinyi.Chief magistrate Evan Makori said the fresh charges were a duplicate of previous charges levelled against Mwinyi. The MP is alleged to have assaulted two officers, created a disturbance and destroyed election materials.He ordered the prosecution to decide which charges they would want to prosecute, since they fall under different sections.Earlier charges fall under the Elections Act while the fresh charges fall under the Penal Code.Makori said the state should set a path on how to charge perpetrators involved in party primaries offences. He said the act is still new and Mwinyi was the first person to face charges under that section.
