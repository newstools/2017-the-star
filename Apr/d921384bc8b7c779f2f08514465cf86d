&ldquo;The party primaries are a precursor to the general election. Fail now and you fail on August 8.&rdquo;That is the message Coast regional coordinator Nelson Marwa (pictured) gave security agents yesterday.The powerful, tough-talking Marwa said police in Mombasa county are performing way below their counterparts in the other five Coast counties in handling the nominations.&ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t manage these nominations, you will not manage the elections,&rdquo; he said during a press briefing in his office.His sentiments raise concerns about the preparedness of the police in Mombasa to handle the general election.Marwa said Mombasa has so far recorded more chaotic nominations than all the other five counties. He accused the police of being compromised by powerful politicians. &ldquo;Why is it only in Mombasa? [Why] not in Kwale, Kilifi, Taita Taveta, Lamu or Tana River. Why only in Mombasa?&rdquo; he asked.ODM has ordered repeat nominations in six wards and 17 polling stations in Mombasa, more than any other county at the Coast.There will also be repeat nominations in five polling stations in Gombato-Bongwe ward, Kwale county, and four polling stations in Tezo ward, Kilifi county.Marwa also put on notice two ODM legislators, two Jubilee MP aspirants, and an MCA who wants to defend his seat in Mombasa and Taita Taveta counties over hooliganism and their questionable sources of campaign money.Among those mentioned are Jomvu MP Badi Twalib, whom Marwa accused of financing youth to cause chaos in the constituency during the nominations.&ldquo;How can a whole MP walk around with rowdy youth armed with machetes and clubs causing chaos?&rdquo; Marwa said.However, Badi&rsquo;s personal assistant Moffat Mutero denied the claims and said the MP is not a hooligan.Marwa also singled out Governor Hassan Joho&rsquo;s cousin Said &lsquo;Saido&rsquo; Abdalla, who is eyeing the Nyali MP seat on the ODM ticket, Jubilee&rsquo;s Ashraf Bayusuf, who is also eyeing the Nyali MP seat, and Mike Banton, who is eyeing the Taveta MP seat on the Jubilee Party ticket.He said the three aspirants&rsquo; source of wealth for their campaigns is questionable. They are now being closely monitored.Saido said his money is clean. Banton was unavailable for comment.
