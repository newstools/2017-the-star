Kenya are still searching for a first win in their five-match tour of Uganda three matches on.The visitors lost the opening and third matches while the second was washed out.In the third match played on Monday, host skipper Davis Karashani and Roger Mukasa guided his team to a 27-run victory at Lugogo Oval.Chasing 200 runs, Kenya appeared to be strolling to their first win at 137 for 4 half way through the inning until another batting collapse came to haunt them by losing six wickets for 35 runs.A change in the bowling that included the day&rsquo;s wicketkeeper Mukasa take on the ball and Karashani&rsquo;s brilliant spell saw the home side snatch a 27 runs win to hand Kenya their second loss.Dhiren Gondaria (55) and Collins Obuya (50) had partnered for 13 overs to get the scores to 114 after 18.1 overs after Kenya had recovered from 30 for 2. After Gondaria&rsquo;s dismissal, Obuya hanged on for seven overs with Shem Obado to get Kenya to 137 for 4 after 25.1 overs.A few balls after reaching his century Obuya was caught- a dismissal that opened the gates of a major collapse as the home team picked the remaining six wickets for 35 runs thanks to a spirited bowling performance from Karashani (3 for 27) and wicket keeper cum bowler Roger Mukasa (2 for 3).Karashani began the collapse by getting his second wicket three balls after having Obuya caught when he had Obado caught behind for a duck in the 26th over.Alex Obanda and Irfan Karim who had been dropped down the order shared a sixth wicket stand of 18 runs in five overs before a suicidal call for a single from Karim saw the stand being broken when Obanda was caught shot of his line.With victory slightly in their sight with 18 overs to go, the home team opted for a spinner and with Francis Nsubuga having finished his spell, Mukasa was forced to leave his gloves and take the ball.The decision paid immediately as Kenya lost three wickets for no run. Mukasa trapped Nelson Odhiambo with his first ball of his second over to leave Kenya on 166 for 7 after 34.1 overs.He picked his second two balls later when he had Lucas Oluoch caught for a duck. From 166 for 6, Kenya were 166 for 9 when Karim was trapped lbw by Karashani on a slow 50 balls 20.The match was done and dusted in the 38th over when Irfan Muhammed bowled Elijah Otieno with the board on 172.Earlier, Uganda batsmen had once again put on major contribution to guide their sides to the final total.Openers Hamu Kayondo (31) and Arthur Kyobe (31) gave their team an opening stand of 51 runs in 11.3 overs.Isaneez Emmanuel (31) who was playing his first match of the series and Deuz Muhumuza (29) put on 64 for the sixth wicket to get them to 160 after 38 overs. Jonathan Ssebanja and Nsubuga remained unbeaten with 17 and 16 respectively as the home team made a huge recovery.
