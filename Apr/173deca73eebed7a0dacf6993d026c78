Finland-based Kenyan singer Sylvia Barasa aka Rawbeena has denied claims that she owes the European country any back taxes.She was summoned by the country&rsquo;s revenue authority to shed light on the tax evasion charges facing her. Commenting on the issue, Rawbeena told Word Is: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t owe any taxes to the Government of Finland. Maybe the company does but not me.&rdquo;She was referring to a promotional company, also owned by Kenyans, called Solid Productions. In a letter sent to Rawbeena by the Finnish tax collection agency, the songstress is asked to &ldquo;clear the type of business you and your partners are doing before 3:4:2017&rdquo;.This letter is a reaction by the Finnish government over nonpayment of taxes from the numerous concerts the production company organised in that country. Solid Productions is being accused of running off with millions of shillings worth of taxes.
