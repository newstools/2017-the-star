Christiano Ronaldo struck twice as holders Real Madrid came from behind to win 2-1 at Bayern Munich in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final on Wednesday.Bayern's Arturo Vidal opened the scoring and missed a penalty but Ronaldo volleyed the equaliser in the 47th minute and scored the winner 13 minutes from time when he was picked out by Marco Asenio and finished calmly.Vidal struck in the 25th minute when he evaded Nacho and met Thiago Alcantara's corner with a thumping header to cap off a spell of Bayern dominance, but he blazed a penalty over the bar in first-half stoppage time following Dani Carvajal's handball.Bayern keeper Manuel Neuer denied Ronaldo and Gareth Bale with fine stops but after Javi Martinez was sent off in the 61st minute following two quick-fire yellow cards, Real took control, leaving Bayern with much to do ahead of the second leg in Spain on Tuesday.Antoine Griezmann&rsquo;s disputed first-half penalty gave Atletico Madrid a slender 1-0 victory over Leicester City in their Champions League quarter final first-leg clash at the Vicente Calderon on Wednesday.The France striker was fouled by Leicester's Marc Albrighton on the edge of the box and referee Jonas Eriksson deemed the action to have continued into the penalty area.Griezmann sent Leicester keeper Kasper Schmeichel the wrong way from the spot after 28 minutes for his 24th goal of the season, while Fernando Torres missed a good chance to double the hosts&rsquo; lead after the break.
