Kisumu Central MP aspirant Onyango Oloo yesterday told hopefuls to allow ODM&rsquo;s National Election Board to conduct party primaries without interference.Oloo, with more than 20 aspirants from Kisumu, defended the board headed by lawyer Geoffrey Yogo.He asked candidates opposed to the board to keep off and allow elections officials to preside over the nominations.On January 18, Oloo, former TNA boss, defected from Jubilee to ODM and brought with him officials from eight counties.On Saturday, some aspirants rejected the ODM board and demanded its disbandment. In a signed statement, the politicians said the board comprised of Yogo, Kennedy Ajwang&rsquo; and Monica Akong&rsquo;o lacks integrity and is incompetent.They want a new board with members picked fromWestern or neighbouring regions to ensure credible nominations. They must also pass the integrity test. The aspirants say current board members are compromised and are &ldquo;known activists&rdquo; in the primaries.Kisumu Governor Jack Ranguma, MPs Onyango Koyoo (Muhoroni), James Nyikal (Seme) and Shakeel Shabbir (Kisumu East) proposed that board members be drawn from Western or other regions.Addressing the press in Kisumu yesterday, Oloo said it is not the mandate of candidates to determine who should preside over nominations. &ldquo;You are aware that I am very new in ODM and I therefore do not know board members,&rdquo; Oloo said.The former TNA boss said candidates, as participants, should play their part and allow the election officials to do their work.&ldquo;It is outright wrong for aspirants to say they have serious doubts about commissioners who are not returning or presiding officers,&rdquo; Oloo said.
