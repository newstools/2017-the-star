Meru ODM leaders have dismissed recommendations of the Miraa Task Force presented to President Uhuru Kenyatta last Tuesday at State House, Nairobi.Led by Michael Mutembei, they said the Sh1.2 billion the President directed be released should be an afterthought, not the priority. The leaders said the main problem is lack of markets for miraa and want this prioritised.&ldquo;The Task Force spent the initial Sh1 billion in big hotels drinking tea and no money was ever received to benefit the farmers. Issuing a report and giving out cash are just political gimmicks and the people of Meru should only remain hopeful that a solution will be found,&rdquo; Mutembei said.He criticised a recommendation that farmers be given money to buy seeds through a sacco, terming it not a well-rehearsed idea. They said Meru has more than 27 banks and 13 saccos, which should have been given the role.Mutembei dismissed a plan to have farmers registered to do away with brokers, saying no business can be complete without middlemen.&ldquo;There&rsquo;re women who sell sacks for wrapping miraa. They&rsquo;re not farmers. There are transporters and exporters. They don&rsquo;t own miraa farms but help in completing the chain of trade. Registering farmers is a divisive tactic by the government to slowly kill the crop,&rdquo; he said. He wants the government to stop using the problem for political gain.
