Tanzanian President John
Magufuli on Friday ordered the immediate dismissal of more than
9,900 civil servants after a nationwide verification of academic
credentials uncovered workers with forged school and college
certificates. Elected in October 2015, Magufuli has dismissed several
senior officials, including the head of the government's
anti-graft body, the tax chief, a senior rail official and head
of the port authority as part of a wider anti-corruption drive. Businesses have long complained that corruption and
government inefficiency were major obstacles to investing in
Tanzania. The crackdown on fake degree holders comes after another
purge launched in March last year discovered more than 19,700
"ghost workers" on the East African nation's public sector
payroll. "We have been working hard to create new jobs while there
are people in government who hold fake degrees," Magufuli said
after receiving a report on academic fraud in the civil service. The government had also been losing 238 billion shillings
($107 million) each year to "ghost workers" who had now been
removed from the public payroll, he said. Tanzania spends more than $260 million per month to pay
civil servants' salaries. The government believes the public
wage bill is bloated, with more than 550,000 civil servants at
national and local levels. Magufuli ordered officials to "name and shame" wrongdoers by
publishing a list of all civil servants with forged academic
qualifications. "These people occupied government positions but had no
qualifications ... they robbed us just like other common
criminals," he said. Magufuli said the audit had also found that the academic
records of more than 1,500 civil servants were used by multiple
people, while over 11,500 government employees had incomplete
academic records.
