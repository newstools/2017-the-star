Senators on Thursday evening were infuriated after it emerged that the Transport ministry has proposed a change in the Lapsset route.Enraged senators poked holes into a statement issued by CS James Macharia. They said they will block the proposal unless the views of the residents and politicians are considered.According to the proposed re-routing, the Sh2.5 trillion mega project will no longer cut through Isiolo-Lokichar via Nginyang. Instead, the road will go through Isiolo-Lerata-Maralal-Baragoi and end in Lokichar.&ldquo;The initial Lapsset corridor study undertaken by the Japan Port Consultants in 2011 proposed the road from Isiolo to pass through Nginyang,&rdquo; the statement reads. &ldquo;However, an ongoing feasibility and detailed designs study has cited difficult terrain and environmental concerns as crucial factors necessitating new alignments.&rdquo;&ldquo;To address the concerns raised on the change of the alignment for this selection, the board has proposed an access road be constructed to serve the Isiolo-Nginyang section to facilitate service provision.&rdquo;The senators said the change &ldquo;is politically motivated&rdquo;.Senators Billow Kerrow (Mandera), John Lonyangapuo (West Pokot), Wilfred Machage (Migori) Fatuma Dullo (nominated) and Naisula Lesuuda (nominated) told the ministry to come clean on the reasons for the proposed change.Dullo, who is eyeing the Isiolo Senate seat, said residents were not consulted.&ldquo;There is no consultation going on on the ground. Lapsset should make decisions after consulting,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;The Transport ministry should go back to the ground. What is being said is political gimmick. There is a lot of political interference .&rdquo;Kerrow said, &ldquo;No change on the route will be effected unless with the approval and authority of this House&rdquo;.The ministry, in the statement presented in the House by Roads and Transport committee vice chairperson Judith Sijeny, said the move is not politically motivated.&ldquo;Accordingly, political considerations are not a factor for location or alignment of the project components,&rdquo; Sinjeny read, amid numerous calls for points of order by senators, who were unsatisfied with the response.The site for the proposed Isiolo Resort City from Kipsing Gap, near Isiolo town, will be changed because of a &ldquo;fragile ecosystem and a wild animals&rsquo; migratory corridor&rdquo;.&ldquo;For the Isiolo Resort City, three sites were considered &mdash; the Kipsing Gap, the Archers Post and Kulamawe,&rdquo; the statement said. &ldquo;They were ranked first, second and third. The need for an ecosystem at the Kipsing Gap to be preserved resulted in the proposed alternative location.&rdquo;The government will not compensate people who had invested in the Kipsing Gap in anticipation of the resort.It said the investments are still valuable as the site, being a migratory route, attracts tourists, hence the potential can be harnessed.
