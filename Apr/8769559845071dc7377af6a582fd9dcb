Cord leader Raila Odinga should drop his presidential ambitions and instead apply for a job as a commissioner at the IEBC as he is obsessed with having a parallel election tallying centre, Ruiru MP Esther Gathogo has said. She said vote counting, tallying and announcement of results is constitutionally the mandate of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission. &ldquo;The opposition leaders should then drop from the race and assume the duties of the IEBC because the rule of law must be respected and it&rsquo;s clear in the Constitution that only the electoral body is responsible for the voting, tallying and releasing of results,&rdquo; Gathogo told the Star yesterday.The MP said that the opposition has already sensed defeat and are leaving nothing to chance to ensure they rise to power.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s against the law and a violation of the Constitution. Just last year they held demonstrations to have the IEBC disbanded and new commissioners recruited. Now they have declared that they have no confidence in the constitutional body they fought for in the streets,&rdquo; Gathogo said.The legislator said the opposition is out to instil fear in Jubilee leaders and supporters as there is no way opposition leaders would announce that JP has won the election.&ldquo;The opposition has been disagreeing and criticising the Jubilee government on every matter, therefore, it will be a daydream to even have the slightest thought that Raila and his allies can stand and announce that UhuRuto have won,&rdquo; she said.Gathogo cautioned the ODM leader against taking moves that are likely to ignite anarchy and violence.&ldquo;Kenyans trust and believe that the IEBC will conduct a free, fair and transparent election. Unless the opposition has other plans for the country, they should abandon their plans to have a parallel tallying centre,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t be cowed by the opposition&rsquo;s intimidation. Jubilee has an agenda for our country unlike our brothers and sisters in NASA.&rdquo;Thika Town MP aspirant Patrick Wainaina dismissed calls by NASA to deploy 50 youths in every polling station as election &lsquo;monitors&rsquo;, saying that would be a recipe for chaos.IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati has warned NASA and other political parties that it is only the agency constitutionally allowed to count, tally, collate, announce and declare election results.Chebukati said the poll agency will ensure credible elections.
