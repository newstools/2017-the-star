The Murang&rsquo;a government has started a milk programme for schools to ensure every child gets 200ml every week.More than 60,000 litres will be consumed each week.The programme launched on Wednesday will benefit more than 300,000 pupils in more than 350 schools.The project will improve health and boost the multimillion-shillings dairy sector by expanding the market for milk.More than 40,000 farmers have been selling their milk to Brookside through Murang&rsquo;a County Creameries, an umbrella for 36 dairy saccos.Launching the programme at Kagio Primary School in Gatanga, Governor Mwangi Wairia said it will improve nutrition for students, especially in areas experiencing famine. &ldquo;Most adults do not have a habit of consuming milk. If they did, and started in childhood, we would not have a challenge even during the rainy season,&rdquo; he added.It will also increase prices of milk through value addition.Milk was distributed to primary schools and Early Childhood Education centres.&ldquo;Murang&rsquo;a county government will buy the milk from Murang&rsquo;a County Creameries and give it to schoolchildren,&rdquo; Wairia said.For the 60,000 litres a week, farmers will pocket close to Sh150 million every year.The governor said the programme precedes the rollout of packaged milk, Murang&rsquo;a Fresh.The milk will be sold to shops and supermarkets across the country, as the county seeks to expand its market globally.&ldquo;Farmers will continue selling some milk to Brookside while we process some to add value,&rdquo; he said.The milk will have a shelf life of three months.Wairia said the dairy sector was his flagship project and he considers the school milk programme a milestone.He said after selling the milk, the county will increase the prices to ensure farmers get higher returns.A month ago, the government started building a milk processing plant at Maragua.&ldquo;The plant will be opened in less than a month and we will then start selling our own milk,&rdquo; he said. The governor is famous for reviving the New KCC.
