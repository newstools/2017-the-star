Mombasa county chief Hassan Joho is not worried about the EACC's investigations into his primary school education.Investigators went to Tom Mboya Primary School on Wednesday to obtain documents and information on whether Joho studied there.EACC deputy CEO Michael Mubea sought to know if he was enrolled at the school, particulars of the enrollment, if he sat KCPE there and the grades he attained.Mubea also asked the headmaster of the Tononoka school for the Governor's leaving certificate and any other relevant information.More on this: EACC sleuths visit Tom Mboya primary in probe on Joho's educationJoho has had run-ins with police officers and government agencies including Knec and the Kenya Revenue Authority.He and his supporters have accused the government of intimidating him as he is severely critical of the Jubilee government.Joho has been accused of forging a 1992 examination result slip with a C+ mean grade to gain entry into University of Nairobi for a Bachelor of Commerce degree in Human Resource Management. Knec said it had proven that documents presented were forged.The Governor denied the allegations and publicly declared that he was proud of his D- grade. He also recorded a statement with the DCI in Mombasa over this a week ago.Regarding the EACC's probe, he emphasised he was not worried and will not interfere with the investigation."We've been told they have gone to ask for my details at my primary school. It is unfortunate that this drama continues instead of such energies being channeled to meaningful issues of development," Joho told the Star on phone.The channeling of resources to improving lives was Joho's message to President Uhuru Kenyatta ahead of a rally in Kibra, Nairobi, that was cancelled to allow budget reading.Read: Joho announces Kibra rally, rebukes Uhuru after recording statement on forgery claimsJoho said it was unfortunate that the EACC was involved in the matter of his academic qualifications."I am not worried. Let them investigate me...my stand will not change," said the fiery governor.Joho earlier said he sat KCSE in 1993, not 1992, as quoted in the forged certificate. The C+ in the forged document is the entry mark for university education.The EACC wants to establish whether he sat his KCPE at the Tononoka school "on or before the year 1989".Investigators who went to the school met at about 9am met the head teacher.&ldquo;They left immediately after presenting their letter to the head teacher. The head teacher is in his office trying to compile his report,&rdquo; said a source around the school.The school head refused to speak to journalists saying he will finish his report in the afternoon and send it back to the commission.The Governor had said, through county communications director Richard Chacha, that he was expecting his fight with the Jubilee government to get dirtier.&ldquo;We are expecting this (fight) to get dirtier but we are prepared for it. Let them go even to nursery school. They should not leave any stone unturned,&rdquo; he said.Joho's woes have seen his security withdrawn, his bank accounts frozen for a probe by the KRA, his family's depots shut and a demand by the taxman for his family to pay taxes amounting to Sh90 million.More on this: Judge stops KRA pursuit of Sh90 million tax owed by Joho's depotsAlso read: Joho family business denies evading Sh90 million taxThe President barred Joho from the relaunch of Mtongwe ferry services and said he would deal with the Governor whom he accused of following his around and interfering with his mandate.Joho accused Uhuru of taking credit for projects initiated by other regimes and funded by donors.
