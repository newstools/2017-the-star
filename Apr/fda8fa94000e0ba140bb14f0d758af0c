Maize traders at the Kenyan boarders are complaining that they are still being charged 50 per cent import duty despite the government zero rating imports two weeks ago.Traders told the Star that Kenya Revenue Authority officials are demanding the fee, saying they are yet to be informed about the scrapping of duty.Last month, National Treasury CS Henry Rotich announced the zero rating of maize imports from Ethiopia and Mexico to ease maize shortage which was effective immediately.But a gazetted notice to this effect was only issued on Thursday last week. The gazette notice No 3575, stated that in pursuit of powers conferred on the Cabinet Secretary under section 114 ( 2 ) of the East African Community Customs Management Act 2004 and in consequence of the declaration by the President of a national disaster through Executive Order No.1 of 2017, duty shall not be charged for the importation of yellow and white maize.The government last week released one million bags of maize to millers at a cost of Sh3,000 a bag and this has led to a reduction of a 2kg packet of maize flour from Sh153 to between Sh121 to Sh129. The government was also hoping that the zero-rated imports would further reduce the price to Sh115, but this could take time.Nick Hutchinson, the chairman of the Cereal Millers Association, said imports from Mexico are yet to arrive and will not start coming into Kenya until next month.This, according to Eastern Africa Grain Council CEO Gerald Masila, means that there will be a limitation of the four-month import period given by the government until the next harvest.&ldquo;If you combine the drought, which has led to a delay in rains hence some farmers planted late, plus the army worm challenge that has affected parts of the Rift Valley region, we may have a prolonged maize shortage. This is a double tragedy for the country,&rdquo; he said.
