Four matches have been lined up on Saturday with Eldoret Falcons hosting Nyamira Starlets, Vihiga Leeds taking on Wadadia at Mumias Complex and Oserian Ladies clashing with Palos in Oserian.Bulemia will play their second match against Eldoret Falcons on April 22 at Butula Polytechnic before hosting Eldoret Palos on May 13th in their third encounter.Obiero, who also doubles up as coach, has appealed to well-wishers to finance the team to enable them honour their away matches. &ldquo;The team is self-supporting. We managed to use our meagre resources to play in the Super League last year where we shrugged off stiff opposition to finish in top position.We are determined to raise the profile of the county if we can get financial and material support from well wishers in the county. Apart from transport and accommodation for the team while playing away, we also need to raise Sh30,000 registration fees,&rdquo; he said. He said Bulemia is the only team in Busia County taking part in the top tier league, thus the need by all aspirants and well wishers to rally behind them
