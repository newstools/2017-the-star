On Good Friday, gospel star Sarah Nanaa bit the bullet and proposed to her boyfriend."Yeah I popped the question and he said, 'Yes, yes, yes!' It is a high time we start being ourselves instead of complaining, take the initiative as a lady," Nanaa told Word Is.The singer who has turned over a new leaf and is not churning out songs for Christ, defended her decision: "I didn't see the big deal in waiting for him to do so and I know we both genuinely love each other."So, what was his reaction? "Of course he was dumbfounded at first, he took like 30 seconds to take in my question," she said, adding, "He said he had for so long waited for that very moment I would say that and I have made him the happiest man."Nanaa did not want to release the proposal photos because her fiance prefers a life away from the limelight. The two have known each other for 16 years."He is someone I have known for a very long time. He knows me very well and understands me and most importantly cares and is always happy for me at all times. I have for some time had this strong feeling that my soul mate is nearby but was wondering where. After lots of prayers, God indeed kept sending him nearer and nearer."
