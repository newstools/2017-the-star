None of the two teams coold find the back of the net again as they took a one-all score to the break.On resumption, &lsquo;Team A&rsquo; seemed to have lost concentration and morale as B team dominated the field, culminating in a Ruth Ingusi strike 15 minutes to time.To advance to the finals, &lsquo;Team A&rsquo; beat Malindi 5-0 while B eliminated Butere with a narrow 2-1 score.The script was the same in the junior category matches &lsquo;Team B&rsquo; beat &lsquo;Team A&rsquo; in a penalty shoot-out after a barren draw in regulation and extra time.Director Solasa Sports Elizabeth Shako who is implimenting the Solidarity with women in distress (Solwogidi) projects praised the talent exhibited during the tourney.&ldquo;Such tournaments are good for us so that we can also identify our best players for the next level in football. Apart from the coaching courses we also sent two staff to be trained as team managers,&rdquo; Shako said.
