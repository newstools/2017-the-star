Six people were arrested at Kalembe Ndile's Syokimau residence as they sought to attach the property over a Sh352,633 debt.Ndile said he was alarmed when the group, comprising of 18 people, sought to force their entry into his premises at 6 am."They arrived in three vehicles. I suspect they are goons hired to intimidate me. Some of them escaped in one of the cars."It has emerged those arrested were workers of an auctioneering firm acting on a March 28 warrant issued by the Employment and Labour Relations court.This is followed a case filed by Kalembe's former employees namely Judith Muthuku and Mary Wavinya for 'illegal dismissal'.The two went to court after they were fired by the politician from Karesh Hardware and Construction Company in 2012.Ndile, speaking at Mlolongo police station where the six are held, denied claims that he owed Muthuku and Wavinya."I had paid the workers through their lawyer," Ndile said, blaming Mavoko MP Patrick Makau for his woes.But Alfred Nyabena, the worker's lawyer, dismissed the politician's assertions."Ndile has not paid the complainants. That is why the court issued a warrant for his property to be attached."Two vehicles used by the auctioneers were detained at Mlolongo police station.Ndile, who dissolved his Tip Tip to join Jubilee Party in September 2016, claimed that Makau has been using strangers to intimidate him.The legislator did not respond to calls or messages when the Star sought his comment on this matter.A senior police officer said the people who had gone to Ndile's house were executing a court warrant.The officer, who asked not be named, said they were waiting for further communication from their bosses over the detained auctioneers. He did not explain why the six were still detained despite the proof they were executing a valid court warrant.
