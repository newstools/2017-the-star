Opposition chief Raila Odinga's ODM has slapped hefty fines on politicians accused of fanning violence in a move to tame hooliganism ahead of the primaries next week.The punishment to its two politicians and reprimanding four others barely comes five days after Raila issued a stern warning.He said the party will not tolerate any form of political violence during nominations.The party yesterday fined Homa Bay Town MP Peter Kaluma (pictured) and his rival Washington Ogaga Sh100,000 each. They were accused of being involved in a scuffle during a fundraiser at the Homa Bay Stadium on November 27 last year.ODM executive director Oduor Ong'wen in a statement also reprimanded and banned Homa Bay county youth leader Kevin Ouma from holding an elective or appointive position in the party.Ouma was found culpable of leading youth to cause disturbance by heckling Governor Cyprian Awiti in the presence of Raila during the memorial service of senator Otieno Kajwang.Kaluma and Ogaga engaged in fist fights that amounted to heckling, stone throwing and gunshots, prior to Raila's arrival at the stadium.The party's National Elections Board has been investigating 10 members associated, present or mentioned in the two incidents and handed the recommendations to the ODM Central Committee. It adopted the report on March 29."These activities have contravened the ODM Code of Conduct, which they have pledged to uphold. They are also a threat to the peaceful conduct of party primaries," Ong'wen said.Those questioned include governor Awiti and Deputy governor Hamilton Orata, Kaluma, Ogaga, Ouma, MP Oyugi Magwanga (Kasipul Kabondo), Gladys Wanga (woman representative), MP Tom Kajwang (Ruaraka), Enos Bolo (governor aspirant) and politician Jack Nduru.The party has cautioned those reprimanded against perpetrating, sponsoring, supporting or engaging in any violence or disruption in campaigns and nominations."These actions should serve to convey a clear message to ODM politicians, aspirants and members that the party is committed to peace at rallies and during primaries," Ong'wen said.Kaluma and Ogaga are yet to be reprieved from the charges of Homa Bay Stadium violence. They have a case pending in court after being released on Sh20,000 cash bail last December. The case will be heard on November 23 and 24 this year.Raila while addressing a meeting convened by hundreds of ODM women drawn from 47 counties contesting various elective seats said the party has put in place measures to ensure nominations are peaceful, free, fair and credible."As the party leader, I have instructed the National Elections Board to take firm action including disqualifying aspirants who use violence in the upcoming nominations. Our policy of zero tolerance of all forms of political violence especially against women aspirants must come alive in the party primaries," he said.He added,"We have issued firm instructions to the National Elections Board that Odm does not condone any form of violence, intimidation and fraud during nominations."The party's secretary general Agnes Zani said more than 500 women have declared to contest on Odm in August 8 polls and asked them not to "tear each other" after losing in nominations but to support the candidate defeat her opponents.Raila said women have been disadvantaged for a very long time in political contest. He added that Odm has lowered their nominations fees to Sh15,000 to ensure many come out to contest and win party tickets.
