 Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa has said Ford Kenya will not hold nominations for the governor position in Trans Nzoia county. Speaking during the opening of classrooms constructed by Kiminini CDF at Chalicha Secondary School, he said the party leadership is working on modalities to give Governor Patrick Khaemba a direct ticket. “We are negotiating with aspirants to allow the governor to finish his second term and I will take over from him in 2022,” Wamalwa said. He said nominations will be free and fair and aspirants must be ready. Wamalwa urged the aspirants to be peaceful during campaigns and after the general election, adding Trans Nzoia is a cosmopolitan county. Khaemba said more than 150 000 residents don’t have title deeds and he is working with President Uhuru Kenyatta to address the problem. He said he hopes Uhuru will give 88,000 title deeds when he visits the county next week.
