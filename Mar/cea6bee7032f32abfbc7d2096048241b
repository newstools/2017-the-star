He also moved money around East Africa and beyond for Islamic State, police said.Kenya has in recent years suffered a series of attacks by al Shabaab, which is waging an insurgency against the UN-backed government in Somalia, where Kenya has deployed peacekeepers.Islamic State has also claimed at least two low-level attacks in Kenya.Kenyan police said Hussein was born in the Somali capital, Mogadishu, and moved to Kenya in 2010 under the guise of being a tourist. He then moved to Libya, via South Africa and Sudan, where he joined IS, before returning to Kenya last November, police added.The two men he was arrested with are also suspected of having links to Islamic State and al Shabaab, the police said.Eight Kenyans were among 12 suspected drug barons arrested in Mombasa during a joint security operation on Thursday night.Items seized during the operation included two pistols and 25 9mm bullets and two vehicles - a grey Toyota Ractis (KCG 021P) and a white Toyota Fielder (KBZ 152f).Others were 11,220 Euros, $4,500, Sh952,935 in notes and coins, seven 3kg packets of a substance believed to be heroin, 136 sachets also believed to be of heroin, fake $36,100 and fake Sh516,000 notes.Regional coordinator Phillip Tuimir said the value of the drugs seized was about Sh10 million.More on this: Eight Kenyans among suspected drug barons arrested in Mombasa
