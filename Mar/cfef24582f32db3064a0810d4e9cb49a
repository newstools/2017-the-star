City residents will receive water for more days in two weeks if the ongoing rains continue, Nairobi Water and Sewerage Company said yesterday.It said it will review water rationing schedule in a fortnight, depending on the impact the rains will have on the level of water in Ndakaini Dam.This will come as a relief to residents who have been digging deeper into their pockets to buy water from vendors.&ldquo;I think there is hope now. We are monitoring the situation,&rdquo; corporate communications officer Mbaruku Vyakweli said.&ldquo;If things go this way and water level in Ndakaini improves, we will review the [water rationing] schedule in two weeks,&rdquo; he said on the phone.The firm tightened rationing because of the fall in water levels at the Ndakaini Dam, which supplies 84 per cent of water used in the city.The level at the dam has been at an all-time low &ndash; less than 40 per cent. This was caused by drought in the Aberdares, Kikuyu and Mt Kenya, the main water catchments for rivers feeding the dam.Vyakweli could not, however, confirm if the rains experienced in the past four days have increased water volume in the dam. He said the dam&rsquo;s director has not filed a report to the head office.City residents, especially those living in slums, have been spending up to Sh80 for a 20-litre jerrycan of water from vendors. Some parts of the city get water once a week.Some residents said they have not received water for a long time and have relied on vendors and salty water from boreholes. They spoke during a public forum on the 2017-18 budget.Meanwhile, the NWSC has admitted it is having problems adhering to the rationing schedule. Technical director Nahashon Muguna said cartels have infiltrated their system and stopped supply to some estates.
