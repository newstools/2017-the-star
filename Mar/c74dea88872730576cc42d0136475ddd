Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale has named Eng James Lusamamba as his running mate for governor, ending months of speculation about whether he would defend his seat.He named his deputy at his office in Kakamega town on Saturday.The Ford Kenya deputy leader has now set the stage for a bruising battle with incumbent Wycliffe Oparanya of ODM and Jubilee&rsquo;s Mabel Muruli, who is yet to name her running mate. Lusamamba unsuccessfully ran for Malava MP in 2013 against Ayub Savula.&ldquo;I am going to release a scandal by Oparanya every week. I will release scandals that are backed by documents. Oparanya should now prepare to face the truth about the mismanagement of public finances in his government,&rdquo; Khalwale said.He added, &ldquo;I am not shaken by Oparanya&rsquo;s decision to campaign using a chopper. Cyrus Jirongo is a billionaire, but I floored him with his choppers in the senate race in 2013&rdquo;The Elections Act requires aspirants to name their running mate before presenting nomination papers to the electoral commission.Governor aspirants will present their nomination papers to the IEBC between June 2 and 3. Clan politics will be at play in the race for the county&rsquo;s top seat. Lusamamba is from the Kabras clan in Lugari. Oparanya&rsquo;s deputy Philip Kutima is also from the clan.
