NASA will hold its first major rally at the Coast in Mombasa town on March 27, amid growing dissent over joint nominations. ODM wants joint nominations for Mombasa governor, while Wiper opposes the idea.When Governor Hassan Joho jetted back from the US on Sunday, he said ODM would want NASA to have a single candidate for the Mombasa race. He said this way, the opposition would beat Jubilee.Joho, however, said his party is open to other mechanisms of selecting candidates, including fielding parallel governor candidates from NASA-affiliated parties. Wiper&rsquo;s Hezron Awiti (Nyali MP) and Senator Hassan Omar want to dethrone Joho.Joho&rsquo;s sentiments came three days after Omar, Wiper secretary general, threatened not to approve NASA&rsquo;s Technical Committe decision if joint nominations will have been incorporated.
