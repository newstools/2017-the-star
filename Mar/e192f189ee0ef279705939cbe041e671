The Kenya Dairy Board has urged milk vendors to acquire licences for their businesses.Board dairy development officer Mildred Kosgei said Kenyans should not buy milk from uncertified dealers.She spoke in Chogoria on Friday during campaigns to educate the public about the benefits of safe milk production and consumption. &ldquo;We are going to educate the public on the benefits of safe milk consumption,&rdquo; Kosgei said.She said farmers and milk vendors should use aluminium cans, instead of plastic jerrycans. Kosgei said the cans should be regularly cleaned.The official said if farmers deliver clean and quality milk, they will rake in huge profits.&ldquo;We want to get quality milk so that we can get better prices for our dairy produce. We are implementing a payment system in which the producers will be paid based on the quality of milk they deliver. If farmers deliver good milk, it means they will earn more,&rdquo; Kosgei said. She said they will educate farmers in all the counties.In September last year, the board said approximately 60 per cent of milk traders are abiding by the hygiene guidelines.Chief inspector Evans Mwangi attributed the rise in compliance to training and awareness campaigns the board had conducted. He said the dairy board inspects milk vendors and identifies gaps that need to be addressed. Mwangi said KDB would enforce the Dairy Industry Act to improve sales. He said vendors are trained on the level of compliance and running a successful business. The dairy board and Kenya Market Trust signed a deal last August on quality assurance.
