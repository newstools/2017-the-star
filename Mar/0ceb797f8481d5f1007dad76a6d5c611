The CBK&rsquo;s Monetary Policy Committee yesterday retained the benchmark lending at 10 per cent for the second time in a row. The MPC &ndash; the bank&rsquo;s top decisionmaking organ &ndash; cited the need to manage rising overall inflation that surpassed the government&rsquo;s upper limit target of 7.5 per cent in February.The average cost of goods and services last month jumped to a 55-month high at 9.04 per cent, largely driven by the increased cost of food, especially vegetables, because of ravaging drought.&ldquo;The committee concluded that overall inflation is expected to remain outside the government target range in the near-term due to the elevated food prices, even as demand pressures remain subdued,&rdquo; CBK Governor Patrick Njoroge said in a statement. &ldquo;The committee remains concerned about the prevailing uncertainties, including the impact of the interest rate caps on the effectiveness of monetary policy.&rdquo;Banks continue to slow down on loans to the private sector, the MPC noted, due to perception of a higher risk than a maximum of 14 per cent interest charges provided in the Banking (Amendment) Act 2016. The amended law was enforced on September 16, 2016. The sectors which were hardest hit by in February were trade, manufacturing, real estate, and private households. These account for 60 per cent of total credit to the private sector, the CBK said. &ldquo;The contribution of these sectors to total credit growth declined gradually to 4.6 percentage points in February 2017, from 13.6 percentage points in July 2015,&rdquo; Njoroge said. This was partly due to a slowdown in exports by the manufacturing sector, delays in registration of land titles and building approvals, and availability of alternative external financing for key private sector projects.
