Lamu Governor Issa Timamy has declared he will neither defect nor drum up support for Jubilee as he had earlier promised.Timamy has been under pressure to ditch NASA, which hosts his ANC party, and support Jubilee.The governor says he will remain in NASA and support its candidate.During his visit to Lamu to commission the construction of the 135km Lamu-Garsen road, President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto urged Timamy to support Jubilee to be spur development in Lamu. The two asked Timamy to distance himself from the opposition, saying Jubilee is focused on services, not empty talk like the opposition.Timamy promised to have a suitable answer for the President when he honours his invitation to come to the county in April. Things looked bright for Jubilee since it seemed to have won over the governor.However, speaking when he met youth, women leaders and the council of elders at Mwana Arafa Hotel in Lamu on Sunday, Timamy said he has been under pressure to join Jubilee.The elders lashed out at Timamy and told him to stay put in NASA, from which they promised to have him reelected.They told the governor Lamu leaders are elected based on their development record and feasibility of their manifestos, not political alliances.Elder Mohamed Omar said, &ldquo;Let the governor remain where he is. Joining Jubilee will not determine whether one loses or wins. What you have done for the people will ensure your victory or lack of it.&rdquo;The representatives urged the governor to beware of leaders and politicians who want to kill his political ambitions. &ldquo;Ruto and the DP have inored Timamy for four years, but suddenly they are interested in him so he can join JP,&rdquo; said Nassir Abdullahi.
