The family of former nominated MP Mark Too has moved to the Court of Appeal to block 3,000 squatters from settling on a disputed 25,000-acre farm.The squatters last month won a case to take over the farm, but Too&rsquo;s family and another 5,000 residents who bought the land, have instructed their lawyer Kham Lagat to appeal against the ruling by Justice Anthony Obwayo.&ldquo;My clients are dissatisfied with the ruling and we will appeal,&rdquo;he said on Friday after a meeting with the residents, who said they purchased the land more than 17 years ago. The clients were led by former Eldoret South MP Jesse Mais, Kipyegon Sawe, Henry Kebenei Joel Matahana, and Wilson Maiyo.Title deeds for Moi University and the Eldoret International Airport will be cancelled following the order by the High Court. The two key state institutions located on the same property.In total, 14,822 title deeds will be revoked following the court order that affects more than 200,000 people living on the land.The family of Too, through his widow Sophie Too told the meeting, at Ngara Falls near Eldoret, that the former legislator owned only 2,000 acres and not the entire 25,000 parcel.Obwayo had on February 8 ruled that the land belongs to squatters who had sued Too and the Commissioner of Lands. They said the land was allocated to them by the government during former President Daniel Moi&rsquo;s administration.&ldquo;We are concerned it is being reported erroneously by the media that Too owned 25,000 acres whose titles have been revoked by the court,&rdquo; Sophie said.She said Too was sued by the squatters because he previously worked as an employee of the defunct East Africa Tanning and Extract Company, that was a subsidiary of Lonrho East Africa. The company initially owned all the land, but later sold it to individuals and firms, Sophie said.
