Five hundred Garissa health workers protested on Saturday, demanding allowances, promotions and to be employed on permanent terms.Kenya Health Professionals&rsquo; Society branch representative Gerald Njoroge said their grievances have been ignored for too long. The health workers drawn from 18 cadres, including clinical officers, lab technicians, radiographers, community health workers and mortuary attendants, marched from Garissa County Referral Hospital to the governor&rsquo;s office and demanded that they be addressed by county chief Nathif Jama.&ldquo;Our members were told to ask the county, not national government, to pay us allowances,&rdquo; one worker said. Jama said the grievances will be resolved.
