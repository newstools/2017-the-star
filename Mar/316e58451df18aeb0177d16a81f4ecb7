Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka will respond to the NGO Board&rsquo;s claims that his foundation has violated rules of operation once he is served with proof.Kalonzo&rsquo;s publicist Dennis Kavisu yesterday told the Star his boss will not honour a 14-day ultimatum issued by the board.He was told to file documents regarding all secret foreign bank accounts and local and foreign funding agreements the foundation has received since January 2010.NGO Board executive director Fazul Mohamed wrote to the Kalonzo Musyoka Foundation for violating regulations.He said the foundation unlawfully operated foreign accounts, receiving millions in foreign currency from unidentified donors.Mohamed said the foreign currency account has also been used to convert Kenya shillings and subsequent crediting to the foundation&rsquo;s bank accounts.&ldquo;The first mistake the board made was to serve the media before him. We have learned about all this in Isiolo and it is clear proof of Jubilee&rsquo;s political gimmicks and propaganda. As a lawyer, Kalonzo will have to see the documentation first because he is reading mischief,&rdquo; Kavisu said.The official insisted they consider the board&rsquo;s directive as mere allegations.&ldquo;When we return to Nairobi we will know if any documentation has been sent to him or not before responding with facts,&rdquo; he said.Kalonzo&rsquo;s foundation is the second to be put on the spot by the board after Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero&rsquo;s. Kalonzo on Saturday denied the board&rsquo;s reports that he owns the foreign accounts. He termed the reports malicious, false and baseless.Kalonzo said the reports are Jubilee machinations to impede his chances of becoming NASA flagbearer.
