IEBC is proposing stringent regulations to curb election malpractices that have been impeding delivery of free, fair and credible results. Some of regulations the commission is proposing include having the returning officer dismiss results of a polling station where the total valid votes exceed number of registered voters. IEBC is also seeking powers to cancel elections in a constituency, county or ward experiencing a serious breach of peace, natural disaster or emergency.Committing grave electoral malpractice or making it difficult for an election to proceed may also result in postponement of an election to a preferable date fixed by IEBC.The Elections (Technology) Regulations, 2017 provisions further render a person ineligible to register as a voter for making two or more applications simultaneously. To curb voter transfer, regulations require a person registering in another constituency to have been a resident in the area for a period of between five and 12 months. "The person should for such a period or periods carried on business, employed, lawfully possessed land or residential buildings there," reads a draft of the regulations that is before Parliament. IEBC during the just concluded second mass voter listing raised a concern over high number of people seeking to transfer voting areas. Chair Wafula Chebukati attributed it to lack of a law regulating voter transfer. The regulations are also amendments to the The Elections Act, 2011.Read: Cord in new battle with IEBC for &lsquo;violating&rsquo; electoral laws
