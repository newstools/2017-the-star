Two strange vehicles and about three police officers were spotted in a plantation where human rights lawyer Willie Kimani and two others are suspected to have been murdered.According to two witnesses, the unidentified police officers were seen at the 90-acre plot at about 7.30pm on the night of June 23, when Kimani, his client Josephat Mwenda and taxi driver Joseph Muiruri are said to have been killed.Agnes Wayua and her brother Athunus Mungalo separately told trial judge Jessie Lesiit they became suspicious and sought help after they saw three men standing next to a car whose hazard lights were on.&ldquo;It is not common for vehicles to come to that plot at that time. Only brokers visit the area, but not at night,&rdquo; Mungalo said.He told the court the strange men, one with a police radio call, informed them they were police officers following notorious thugs who had planned a raid.Wayua said her husband&rsquo;s family owns the land. She said she noticed the suspicious car first and informed her brother, who alerted a friend called Kim and another police officer identified as Paul Mitambo, a neighbour.Mitambo, attached to the Mlolongo police station, asked the two to accompany him to where the strange car had been parked.&ldquo;Mitambo had a gun and was in police uniform. He told us to wait in his car as he approached the men. He demanded to know who they were and what they were doing there at that time,&rdquo; Mungalo said.&ldquo;I heard them tell Mitambo they were police officers just like him and were after thugs.&rdquo;At that point, Mitambo asked the Wayua and Mungalo to return home and sleep. But before Mungalo left, a second vehicle joined the three men.
