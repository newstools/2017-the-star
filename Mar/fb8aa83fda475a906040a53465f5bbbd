Controversial Coast regional coordinator Nelson Marwa has received threats from drug barons for fighting the menace.He said the government will not relent on the war on drugs.&ldquo;How can you fight a legitimate government? It does not add up,&rdquo; Marwa said yesterday. He spoke in Miritini after inspecting the rehabilitation centre which will be commissioned by President Uhuru Kenyatta.Marwa said the authorities have devised strategies to weed out drug barons, including cutting demand by taking addicts for rehabilitation. &ldquo;This will disrupt supply and force dealers to seek other markets,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;It will take them time to secure another market.&rdquo;The Miritini centre is on 13 acres. It will have sports and health facilities. It will also have a learning institution.Marwa said drug barons started issuing threats after Uhuru issued orders to have them arrested and charged.Last month, the government said it will crack down on drug barons, regardless of their position in society.
