Residents of Ndharako and Shirango villages in Bamba ward, Kilifi county, are living in fear after a pride of lions killed six cattle and several goats.The pride of eight has disrupted classes at the only primary school in the area - Jira Primary School.The school has had to change its timetable so that pupils report late and leave early for fear that they may be attacked by the lions. Speaking to journalists on Saturday, Shirango village elder Barisa Thise said the lions pose a great danger to the community, which is yet to recover from the effects of drought.Bamba MCA Daniel Mangi accused the Kenya Wildlife Service of not performing its duties.He accused the agency of not protecting residents and their livestock and, instead, raiding their homes in search of game meat. &ldquo;The KWS has the responsibility to tame the lions. They have failed to protect my people with their livestock. Instead, it uses government resources to move around harassing innocent people,&rdquo; Mangi said.He added that if an elephant died, more than three helicopters would be dispatched to look for the poacher. &ldquo;Since it is the lions which are attacking people there is no action being taken,&rdquo; Mangi said.He said he will mobilise the community to protest against KWS officers&rsquo; laxity.Ndharako and Shirango villages border the Tsavo East National Park to the west.The national park is half-fenced and wild animals are free to roam into people&rsquo;s homesteads.&ldquo;Wild animals have become a thorn to us. Lions, cheetahs, leopards and hyenas are always roaming around our homes. Lions are killing our livestock. Four lions walk together, while others are spotted alone,&rdquo; elder Thise said.&ldquo;Our livestock are being finished by these lions. Six cows and 23 goats have been killed by the lions in two weeks.&rdquo;The village elder said the affected families reported the matter to KWS, who visited the area but failed to drive the animals back into the park.
