Former Cabinet minister Henry Kosgey has promised to transform the Nandi county in five years if elected. He said he is the best bet for governor.Kosgey, a long-serving Nandi leader, was first elected Tinderet MP in 1979. He was subsequently reelected in 1983, 1992, 1997, 2002 and 2007 general elections.Kosgey said he will ensure the county fully exploits the opportunities devolution offers.&ldquo;The people of Nandi know me very well, and all I can say is that I am the best man to be governor. After five years, you will see the results of my leadership,&rdquo; he told women leaders in Nandi Hills on Monday.Kosgey will face incumbent Governor Cleophas Lagat and former Agriculture CS Felix Koskei for the Jubilee Party ticket.A recent opinion poll by Tifa placed Kosgey ahead, followed by Koskei and Lagat.Deputy Governor Dominic Biwott has, however, urged voters to reelect Lagat, so he will take over from him in 2022.&ldquo;Governor Lagat has performed very well, despite the challenges devolution faces and he deserves a second term,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My political future and ambition to be governor is in your hands. Do not end my ambitions prematurely.&ldquo;This election is also about my bid to succeed Lagat in 2022 and that is why I am requesting you to give us a second term.&rdquo; Biwott, who spoke in Kapkeno, Nandi, said the pioneer government has laid the foundation for economic growth, and the county has a bright future.&ldquo;In our second term, residents of Nandi will realise more fruits of devolution because we have set a strong foundation,&rdquo; he said.Biwott said they have achieved great successes in healthcare, education, infrastructure, agriculture and tourism, among other sectors.
