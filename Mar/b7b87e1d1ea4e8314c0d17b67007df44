The Mombasa High Court has recovered more than Sh6 million that disappeared from an Admiralty Marshal Account. The US$65,060 (Sh6,505,600) had erroneously been overpaid to a law firm in Nairobi on account of another claim. The funds were deposited at the Commercial Bank of Africa. The money was part of Sh38 million meant to pay the wages of five crew members of the MV Ponmudi. It went missing in 2012. The crew was transporting communications equipment to Somalia in 2010, when their ship developed mechanical problems midway and it had to be towed back to Kenya. The crew moved to court in 2011, demanding their wages for the three months they were at sea. Retired Mombasa resident judge Justice Anyara Emukhule and chief magistrate Teresiah Matheka had previously denied involvement in the disappearance of the money. Documents seen by the Star show the funds were channelled to the judiciary Admiralty Marshal account on February 27, 2017, but wers received on February 28. Chaudhri and Associates wrote a letter to the manager Habib Bank, requesting transfer of $65,060 from account number 31113-57 to account name Admiralty Marshal, High Court of Kenya, Mombasa with account number 6616320017-0316221507 at the Commercial Bank of Africa, Mombasa.
