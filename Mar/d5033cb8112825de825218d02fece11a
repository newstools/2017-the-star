The National Drought Management Authority has purchased animals feeds worth Sh6 million for pastoralists in West Pokot county to help mitigate the effects of the drought.This was announced by West Pokot NDMA response officer Tim Letoyia, when he distributed the feed to pastoralists in North Pokot subcounty.The county received 2,000 bales of hay, 2,000 urea-molasses, mineral blocks and 300 pellets to help sustain animals for a period of two weeks. He said the consignment will be distributed to the most affected farmers in Central and North Pokot subcounties.They are targetting dairy cattle, that remained behind after others moved to other parts in search of pasture and water. He urged farmers to follow the laid-down guidelines when giving the supplements because over-feeding may cause death.&ldquo;You only need to give a half-a-kilo of the supplements to a cow per day,&rdquo; he said.Letoyia said the authority decided to focus on the dairy cows because they are helping in sustaining lives in the worst-hit areas in the region.
