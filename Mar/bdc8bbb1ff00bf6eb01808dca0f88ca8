Mathare MP Stephen Kariuki has asked Jubilee hopefuls in the Nairobi Governor race to avoid shideshows. He said JP's main agenda is to get a strong candidate who will run against the incumbent during the August 8 polls. Kariuki said his role in the contest is to preach peace and unity among JP aspirants. The legislator, who was elected through ODM but now ascribes to the Jubilee Party, says he has no favourite candidate in the race. The MP was responding to concerns that he has not taken a stand on who to back for the Jubilee ticket ahead of the primaries. Kariuki accompanied Peter Kenneth when the latter presented his nomination papers for consideration to fly JP's flag. The legislator equally accompanied Johnson Sakaja - now seeking Nairobi Senator seat - for the presentation. On Friday, he was with Sonko and reiterated that JP's common focus is to take away the seat from ODM. "I am walking with Kenneth, Sonko, and Sakaja because our competitors are NASA and Kidero," Kariuki said at JP headquarters in Pangani, Nairobi. "So, for those question my moves, it is important that we focus on that. The rest are sideshows." Former Starehe MP Margaret Wanjiru, Kariuki's mother, is also eyeing the JP ticket and had also presented her papers for the same. Kariuki called on the aspirants to campaign peacefully to ensure the party gets a strong candidate. "I beg all of you seeking various seats under Jubilee in Nairobi to agree who will carry the flag. Voters will be more than happy to vote for Jubilee," he said See: [VIDEO] Nairobi battle heats up as Sonko, Waweru submit nomination papers Also read: Sakaja quits governor race, presents nomination papers for senator
