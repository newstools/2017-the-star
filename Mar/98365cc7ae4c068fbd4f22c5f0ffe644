President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto's frequent trips to the Coast will not increase their popularity, Kilifi ODM leaders have said.Led by Governor Amason Kingi and Senator Stewart Madzayo, they said Jubilee will not win the people's hearts even if operations are moved to Mombasa.They said Opposition leader Raila Odinga's ODM party was more popular and was going stronger, and that those who have defected to the ruling coalition were not important.The leaders included MPs William Kamoti of Rabai and his Malindi counterpart Willy Mtengo, and more than 10 MCAs.They said, during a rally at Dr Kraph memorial grounds in Rabai, that Jubilee should stop wasting time campaigning in the region.Read: Two injured after Kingi, Kamto supporters clash in RabaiKingi said he did not see any reason to join Jubilee as it did not add any value. He said nothing had been done towards development ever since Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya move from ODM."Development funds will not reduce or increase in whichever party I will be but I cannot kneel for Jubilee, he said.The Governor said the amount of devolved funds would only increase under a Raila presidency.Kingi said that when NASA takes over on August 9, the allocation will increase from 15 per cent to 47 per cent.Uhuru and Ruto have been inspecting development projects at the Coast for the last three days.Their many trips to the region are aimed at luring voters but they have faced heavy resistance from Opposition leaders.At the memorial grounds two weeks ago, Ruto received ODM defectors including Deputy Governor Kennedy Kamto and MCA Anthony Kenga who is seeking the Rabai parliamentary seat.The leaders claimed they had dumped ODM because it had no democracy, particularly in nominations, as some candidates were favoured.Read: Drop combative approach to Uhuru's Coast tours, Shahbal tells JohoAlso read: Taita Taveta Senator Mwazo, woman MP Joyce Lay leave Raila for UhuruBut Kingi dismissed the claims saying ODM was the only democratic party in Africa and urged aspirants to go to the people with their manifestos and compete for tickets.
