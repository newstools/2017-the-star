Hundreds of Kisumu residents on Friday protested against the alleged plan to sell the Sh4.2 billion Lake Basin Development Authority mall.Led by Youth Reconciliation Forum of Kenya Director Erick Okello, they demanded to know why the mall has not been operationalised. They accused Devolution CS Mwangi Kiunjuri of deliberately delaying to pay the contractor upon receiving the report of the mall. Okello also accused powerful individuals in the Jubilee administration of plotting to buy the mall. &ldquo;We are the taxpayers&rsquo; and that mall must benefit the locals. Those who think they can manoeuvre to buy the mall through illegal deals will be in rude shock,&rdquo; he said. In reference to the state agencies deliberations, Okello said Attorney General Githu Muigai and Auditor General Edward Ouko have advised the Devolution ministry to pay the contractor. &ldquo;We are also aware that Sh2.5billion owed to the contractor has deliberately not been paid so as to accrue interest to enable those interested to purchase the mall at the expense of Kisumu residents,&rdquo; he said.The delay has seen the project accrue Sh1.5 million interest per day.Okello, who on Friday led the protesters from the mall in Mamboleo, Kondele, demanded to know what the ministry is doing to solve the stalemate. &ldquo;We are sending a strong signal to anyone who may want to sell or buy the mall that it will be brought down or burnt if it does not benefit the people of Kisumu,&rdquo; he said.On Thursday, Nyando MP Fred Outa urged the government to expedite the payment.
