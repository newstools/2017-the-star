Alfred Mutua's Maendeleo Chap Chap is gaining ground in areas perceived to be Jubilee and Nasa strongholds.Many aspirants in the leading coalitions fear being locked out during party primaries ahead of the August 8 polls.On Thursday, the Machakos Governor received hundreds of aspirants and leaders from various counties including Embu, Turkana and Baringo.The Governor hit out at leaders and parties for zoning regions as their strongholds. He said he will write a protest letter on the matter to IEBC, adding that the practice encourages intolerance and retrogressive politics. "Those parties that are disrupting their opponents' rallies should be blacklisted and their candidates barred from running in elections," he said. He said Kenyans were free to seek elective seats anywhere in the country without intimidation. Mutua assured all aspirants that the party nominations will be free, fair and credible. "We will not make the mistakes being witnessed in other parties."Read: NASA will take care of all Opposition leaders, Mudavadi says amid fallout fearsAlso read: Kanu to reap big from Jubilee merger fallout, Raymond MoiAmong heavyweights who have joined MCC are President Uhuru Kenyatta's former adviser Kilemi Mwiria, Embu Senator Lenny Kivuti and Nominated Senator Emma Mbura.Aspirants said they were opting for Chap Chap because of its democratic practices."We have seen what [Mutua] has done and want the same in our county because we come from marginalised areas," said Mary Rikiriko, who is eyeing the West Pokot woman representative seat.Ali Mahamud, who decamped from Jubilee, said Mutua's party has a national outlook and is offering transformative leadership."Mutua has offered leadership at the county level which we can all see," he said.Read: Uhuru's adviser Kilemi Mwiria decamps to Alfred Mutua's Chap Chap partyAbdulahi Sule, a Garissa Township MP aspirant said he is in Mutua's party as it represents development."Don't be duped that it is a two-horse race in Garissa [between Majority leader Aden Duale and former deputy Speaker Farah Maalim]," he added.MCAs Salagat Nchoe (Mosiro Ward) and Richard Kililit are among those who defected to Maendeleo Chap Chap.Other hopefuls who joined MCC include Leonard Muriuki, who wants to vie as Embu Senator and former Citizen TV reporter Kedangor Obadiah, who wants to vie for Kapenguria MP.Jubilee decampers are Cecilia Nangetei, Ali Mahamud and Cynthia Kipchillat.More on this: Why Jubilee may lose majority seats in parliament
