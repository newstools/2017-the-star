Machakos government workers yesterday boycotted work over unpaid salary arrears and lack of appointment letters, disrupting services in county offices.They marched to the county Public Service Board offices to present their demands.The County Government Workers Union branch secretary Chris Mutua told journalists that they had given the county a seven-day notice to meet their demand or they skip work.The Machakos government owes Sh140 million in salary arrears to workers it inherited from the now-defunct county councils, he said. The arrears have accrued from 2013.Mutua said they want the county to issue permanent employment letters to 340 Inspectorate officers. For three years now these officers have been working without appointment letters, which is contrary to the labour laws of this country. This strike is not ending until they are issued with permanent employment letters, he said.Mutua added that the union is also demanding the county pay all allowances, including leave and transfer allowances. We know of 72 staff officers of Matungulu and Kangundo subcounties who had their services terminated unlawfully. We demand that they are immediately reinstated, he said.
