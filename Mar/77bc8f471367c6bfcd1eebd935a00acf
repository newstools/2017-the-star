Nine people accused of being members of criminal gang &lsquo;China Squad&rsquo; appeared in a Kisumu court yesterday.They are accused of robbery with violence, extortion and being members of an outlawed criminal group.The nine are Paul Onyango, Erick Ombima, Geoffrey Okello, Braham Otieno, Maurice Ochieng, Ben Nyangile, Stephen Okoth, Elvis Omondi and Cornel Ofula.The prosecution said complaints were made by residents Philip Ochieng and Tom Odingo.Prosecutor Lazurus Sirturi filed an application to have the suspects held for seven days as investigations continue. He said they need more time to arrest other members of the gang, who are at large.But the defence dismissed the application, saying detaining the suspects served no purpose other than infringing on their rights.Defence lawyer Charles Onyango said the prosecutor did not give compelling reasons to warrant the detention of the nine.He said the suspects have not been charged and cannot spend another night in the cells. Onyango said the application was cruel, degrading and unusual punishment.He said there was no connection between the arrested suspects and those yet to be arrested. &ldquo;Nothing ties the arrest of the others to the freedom of the suspects,&rdquo; Onyango said.He said there is no provision that allows police to arrest anyone on suspicion, without evidence.&ldquo;If the prosecution is not ready to charge the suspects, why were they arresting them in the first place?&rdquo; Onyango said. Remanded three daysChief magistrate Julius Ng&rsquo;arNg&rsquo;ar remanded the suspects until Monday, when further directions will be issued.Security officers launched a crackdown on illegal groups in Nyanza on Wednesday.Regional coordinator Wilson Njenga said China Squad has been terrorising residents and businesspeople.He said the government has gazetted a list of outlawed groups, including the American Marines.Njenga warned the groups that there is no room for criminal activities ahead of the August 8 general election.&ldquo;Some of the illegal groups are affiliated to politicians and we will weed them out before the polls,&rdquo; he said. Njenga urged residents to volunteer information about suspected criminals.He said some politicians use such groups as goons. Njenga urged the politicians to do peaceful campaigns.&ldquo;Citizens have the right to conduct their business uninterrupted. The law will not be applied selectively, so any politician found spreading incitement messages and hate speech will face the law,&rdquo; he said. Nyanza regional police coordinator Willy Lugusa warned politicians against hiring goons to disrupt their opponents&rsquo; meetings.
