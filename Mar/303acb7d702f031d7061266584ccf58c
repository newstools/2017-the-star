Whoever will engage in hooliganism will have himself /herself to blame," she said on Friday.Pareno said the staggered approach to the primaries will give the board enough time to monitor aspirants who have tainted the county's image in the past.But she assured that they have put in place measures to guarantee a credible process.ODM has allayed fears that its nominations will interfere with those of the National Super Alliance.Pareno said on March 2 that the party will adjust its activities accordingly to fit in the proposals by the NASA team."We shall give a timetable for our primaries that will show the counties where we shall conduct the nominations," she said.More on this: We will not interfere with NASA's plan for joint nominations - ODMODM has outlined strict requirements that might bar disloyal party members and those who have failed to remit party dues running into millions of shillings.Pareno said last November that elected officials will have to pay all arrears, which include non-refundable dues, life membership, monthly subscription and nomination fee to the party account to qualify for nominations. All other interested candidates will also have to pay the non-refundable fee, life membership fee, and the monthly subscriptions to run the party affairs, she said.More on this: ODM outlines strict rules for aspirants before nominationsAlso read: Aspirants shun ODM over nomination fee
