Two important developments have taken place in the political sphere this past week, both of which call for deep reflection and prompt corrective action.The Senate and other devolution players have just finished a major summit on devolution in Mombasa. At the same time, questions are being increasingly asked whether Kenyans are getting value from the Senate.New generations of Kenyans need to seriously and soberly think about the Senate. Older Kenyans, those with adult memories of the fall of the first Senate 51 years ago, are entering old age.A number of aspirants and parties were declaring and starting to prepare for the party nominations. So far, the process has been chaotic and violent, including inside ruling party JP.This is regrettable, particularly considering the fact that if conducted fairly and transparently, the nominations would almost certainly be the precursor to a free, credible and satisfactory general election.The general election must not be prefaced by skullduggery and chaos.
