President Uhuru Kenyatta has cancelled his two-day visit to Tharaka Nithi and Meru counties. State House spokesperson Manoah Esipisu said the tour, earlier scheduled for Tuesday, was called off due to unavoidable circumstances. In a statement on Monday, Esipisu said the President will visit Western later on in the week. "He will be in Trans Nzoia, Bungoma, Busia and Kakamega counties," Esipisu said. "A detailed programme will be issued in due course of the Western region tour." The President had been scheduled to commission projects in the two counties. They included health facilities, roads and other development initiatives. There is a bitter rivalry between Party of National Unity (PNU) and Jubilee supporters. PNU is led by Meru Governor Peter Munya while Senator Kiraitu Murungi is the Jubilee point man in the area. In January, PNU billboards in Meru town were vandalised when the President toured the area.
