More than five aspirants have so far declared their interest in the Nyeri governor seat, a race that is expected to be a battle of billionaires.They are former director of Vision 2030 Wahome Gakuru, industrialist Githinji Cocorico, hotelier Patrick Munene, Brade Gate Poultry Industries owner Thuo Mathenge and Athi Water Services chairman Wachira Keen.Gakuru, Munene, Mathenge and Keen were in the race in the 2013 general election but lost to the late Governor Nderitu Gachagua.Cocorico is running for the seat for the first time.Senator Mutahi Kagwe said he will make announcement regarding his candidacy after Gachagua's burial.The aspirants are yet to name their running mates, although Gakuru has reportedly approached Nyeri KNUT executive secretary Mutahi Kahiga.National Oil Corporation board chairman Daniel Wamahiu and former Mathira MP Ephraim Maina, who were initially expected to vie for governor, will now stand for the Senate seat.No woman is yet to declared interest in the governor seat.Most of the aspirants who had announced interest in the governor and Senate seats have since gone back to the drawing board after the death of Gachagua, who died of pancreatic cancer last Friday at a London Hospital in the UK, just months to the polls.This is because he had already declared he would defend his seat on the Jubilee ticket, and paid the nomination fee.Gachagua and Maina who hails from Mathira &mdash; which is the political hotbed of Nyeri county &mdash; have been the political bigwigs, and have shaped Nyeri politics since the former was elected MP in 2002 due to their wealth. Gachagua lost the Mathira seat to Maina in 2007. It became a family rivalry.With the demise of Gachagua, Maina, popularly known as Engineer, Maina can easily win the Senate seat. The rivalry could, however, be far from over since Rigathi Gachagua, the late governor's younger brother, has already declared interest in Mathira parliamentary seat.Maina vied for Senate in 2013 on the TNA ticket but lost to incumbent Kagwe, who run on the Narc ticket. If Kagwe opts to run for governor, he will face others in the Jubilee nominations in April.The swearing in of the Second Nyeri Governor, Samuel Wamathai, who took the mantle after Gachagua's demise could also complicate the governor race because he might also vie.Wamathai has since indicated he is ready to defend his new position. Many, however, say he is not a big threat to any candidate.It is not clear which governor aspirant the Gachagua family will endorse with its expansive political machinery and network and resources. Sources say the family is already it is backing Wamahiu for the Senate seat.Historically, political parties in Nyeri don&rsquo;t matter as much as the candidates themselves and their personality.For instance, Gachagua in 2013 won with 137,469 votes on the GNU ticket against TNA&rsquo;s Gakuru, who managed 126,776.Senator Kagwe won on the Narc ticket against Maina, who was the TNA candidate, while Weru of Mathira won on the Narc ticket.There are several MCAs who stood and won on other small parties such as Ford Asili and Saba Saba.Priscilla Nyokabi will defend her woman representative position against Rahab Mukami, Cecilia Ndung&rsquo;u and little-known others.Tribal politics don't play out in Nyeri since the area is widely inhabited by the Kikuyu, who don't identify so much with their clans, at least politically.Some of the interesting aspirants in Nyeri include 72-year-old Wambura Wamaranga, who is vying for the Mathira parliamentary seat.Wamaranga, who has caused some excitement in Mathira will face 10 others, including Rigathi, incumbent Peter Weru, George Warutere, Julius Mwaniki and Cathy Irungu, among others.Political commentator Ngunjiri Wambugu, who is also vying for Nyeri Town Parliamentary aspirant said Gachagua and Wamathai have not performed as per the expectations of many, and voters will look for other options.Ngunjiri told a Star writer in an earlier interview that if Nyeri constituency if leveraged around issues, and not individuals, will influence who becomes governor. In 2013, Kieni and Mathira were the key determinants of the winner in the governor race.&ldquo;A good candidate needs to put up a structure which will improve agriculture, youth and health matters. Must create enabling environment and improve infrastructure. Gachagua&rsquo;s government did not deliver to Nyerians."Nyeri bishop Erastus Njoroge of Four Square Church says Gachagua's work is yet to be felt on the ground, four years after the onset of devolution.&ldquo;He only initiated the Elimu Fund, which has benefited bright and needy students. The rest is public relations. He did not complete his fight for the coffee farmers. He has left them as poor as they were when he came in. Aspirants should focus much on development mostly, especially irrigation water for the people of Kieni which is the food basket of the County,&rdquo; Njoroge said.Nyeri is an agricultural country mostly with tea and coffee as the main cash crops.John Maina, a mechanic in Nyeri Town, said the people of Nyeri must take a different route in August and send all the elected leaders home &mdash; governor, senator, MPs and MCAs.Location:Located in central Kenya, it borders Kirinyaga and Meru to the East, Laikipia to the North, Nyandarua to the West and Murang&rsquo;a to the South.Area (Km 2): 3,337 Km 2Population: 693,558Population Density: 208 people per Km 2Agriculture and AgribusinessAgriculture directly contributes 26% of Kenya's annual GDP and another 25% indirectly.In Nyeri County agriculture currently employs 32.84% of the population.With an agricultural potential of 758.5 square kilometers of arable land, agribusiness is one of the main economic activities within the county.&nbsp;&nbsp;
