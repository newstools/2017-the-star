Three Jubilee members in Trans Nzoia county have dismissed former Forestry minister Noah Wekesa&rsquo;s proposal on negotiated democracy.They are Josephat Ekidor, Senator hopeful Peter Chemuigut and woman representative Janet Nangabo.Ekidor said the arrangement should only apply to the governor and the deputy governor. Wekesa had said the governor should be a Luhya and the deputy a Nandi.He also suggested the woman representative be from the minority Kikuyu community.This would mean Nangabo would be replaced by Eunice Karanja, who emerged third in 2013.If the arrangement is implemented, Kiminini, Kwanza and Saboti will have Luhya candidates, while Cherangany and Endebess will have a Nandi and Sabaot candidates, respectively. Ekidor said, &ldquo;This arrangement is unnecessary, and should only apply to the governor and his deputy. The others should be left to voters to decide as Jubilee has said nominations will be free and fair.&rdquo;preferred candidates?There are fears Deputy President William Ruto has preferred candidates.It is said Ruto wants Saboti MP David Wafula to get a direct ticket because he is perceived to be loyal.Other aspirants said to be in line for direct nominations are Robert Pukose (Endebess), Julius Mbagaya (Kiminini), Wesley Korir (Cherangany) and Abraham Singoei of (Kwanza).Water CS Eugene Wamalwa had initially hinted he could run for governor, but announced he will instead focus on marketing Jubilee.
