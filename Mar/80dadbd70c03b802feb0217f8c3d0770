Jubilee-allied MPs in Turkana yesterday said the region is not a NASA stronghold as the battle for governor intensifies between Governor Josphat Nanok and Senator John Munyes.Turkana South MP James Lomenen said he is confident Jubilee, through Munyes, will defeat Nanok in the poll.But Nanok said Jubilee is wasting time in a region that is fully behind NASA.&ldquo;Turkana has for long been perceived to be an opposition stronghold but the work we have done will change that,&rdquo; Lomenen said.He and Munyes predicted that Jubilee would win most seats in a region that Deputy President William Ruto and ODM leader Raila Odinga have been visiting frequently to campaign.Lomenen said Nanok has allegedly been discriminating against Jubilee supporters and their areas.He said the county government has sidelined residents in the award of tenders, depending on their political allegiance. Lomenen said those who win tenders are ODM allies. &ldquo;He was not elected to serve certain people, but the entire county,&rdquo; he said.Meanwhile, Lokichar MCA Raphael Loperito has ditched ODM for the ruling Jubilee Party.
