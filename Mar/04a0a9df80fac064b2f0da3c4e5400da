Bungoma politician Moses Nandalwe has lashed out at Jubilee for intimidating Mombasa Governor Hassan Ali Joho for his firm stand against the government.Nandalwe said accusations being levelled against Joho are driven by malice, witch hunt, and are meant to finish him politically. He was speaking to the Star on the phone yesterday. Nandalwe warned the government against resorting to dirty tactics saying they could plunge the country into violence, now that the general election is just around the corner. &ldquo;Jubilee has been applying the law selectively. Opposition leaders&rsquo; academic certificates are the target yet credentials of Jubilee leaders, including those of President Uhuru Kenyatta, are questionable,&rdquo; he said.Nandalwe said Uhuru should first tell Kenyans the schools he attended. &ldquo;His father was the founder of this nation. Why did he send his son (Uhuru) abroad to study instead of the University of Nairobi? When he came back he claimed he had studied, how can we be sure?&rsquo;&rsquo; he said.&ldquo;Kabete MP Ferdinand Waititu has a pending court case in which his academic credentials are being challenged. We first want a ruling on that case,&rdquo; Nandawe said. Waititu says he studied at PUNJAP university, India, and graduated in 1993. Nandalwe also cited Sirisia MP John Waluke, who he said dropped out of school in form two, joined the military but was kicked out for being incompetent.
