Limuru residents are leading in the war on crime by reporting suspicious activity to the authorities.Assistant county commissioner Gitobu Kirera said residents have realised the effects of high crime rates on investment and businesses.&ldquo;Investors cannot risk setting up businesses in areas where crime is high,&rdquo; he said. Kirera spoke at the Rironi AP camp on Monday. He presided over the handing over of five self-contained houses for AP officers. The houses were built using CDF cash for a total of Sh 3.9 million. MP John Kiragu and Limuru Central MCA Njenga Murugami were present.Murugami praised CDF officials for putting up the are two-room houses. &ldquo;They might be small, but they have a bathroom, sink, shower, piped water and a balcony. We are used to police living in iron sheet houses,&rdquo; he said.Kirera said security officials have been creating awareness on the importance of reporting crime.&ldquo;We can only win the war on crime if we share the correct information. We need to assure whistleblowers of their safety and carry out thorough investigations,&rdquo; he said.Kirera praised residents, and specifically Nyumba Kumi members, for sharing information with chiefs and their assistants.&ldquo;The community has heard our plea and has changed its attitude towards crime. While before they believed it was the sole responsibility of the police to fight crime, they now know safety is everyone&rsquo;s responsibility,&rdquo; he said.
