The number of people in need of relief food could rise to four million if no rains by the end of April.Agriculture PS Richard Lesiyampe yesterday told the Senate Standing Committee on Agriculture the current situation looks grave as severe drought continues to ravage parts of the country, with no indication of rains.He said following President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s declaration of drought as a natural disaster, the United Nations agencies dealing with humanitarian crises will tomorrow making a $200 million (Sh20 billion) appeal in aid of millions of Kenyans facing starvation.&ldquo;Currently, 2.7 million people, particularly from the arid and semi-arid areas, are in need of relief assistance. An additional 300,000 people in marginal areas of high-medium-rainfall regions also require similar support. At the same time, it is projected that the number of needy populations will continue to grow as the drought persists,&rdquo; Lesiyampe said.He said the situation is likely to worsen as the forecast for March-May long rains indicates the rainfall will be near normal to below normal.&ldquo;The assessments report indicated overall decline in food production. In some areas, there was near total crop failure and water scarcity, escalating the severity of the drought. Food insecurity and malnutrition have been aggravated by depleted household food stocks, eroded pasture, and deteriorating water availability due to drying of water sources,&rdquo; he said.Lesiyampe said despite the food insecurity in ASAL areas, there is adequate stock of cereals and pulses. The total production of maize in Kenya&rsquo;s grain basket was at 32.7 million bags due to erratic rains. This, he said, is a decline from the long-term average of 34.2 million bags, about 4.4 per cent.&ldquo;In 2016, the production of wheat, sorghum and potatoes declined by 11, 17 and 28 per cent respectively. The production of maize from the short rains was about 1.7 million bags, down from a long-term average of about six million bags, representing about 72 per cent,&rdquo; Lesiyampe said.Maize stock as at February 28 stood at 12,139,680 ( 90kg bag), with farmers holding 8,525,600 bags, traders 1,463,200, millers 725,400 and NCPB 1,425,480. Lesiyampe said the projected food balance sheet to June shows there is enough maize in the country up to May.&ldquo;The deficit of 828,790 bags will be met through imports from the region and other food commodities available locally. The markets are functioning normally and have adequate supplies, though the prices have increased, particularly for maize and horticultural crops,&rdquo; the PS said.Maize price in the North Rift has risen to between Sh3,300 to Sh3,800 per 90kg bag, compared to Sh2,700 to Sh3,000 in December 2016. NCPB price remains at Sh3,000 per 90kg bag.
