Jubilee Party leaders yesterday dismissed NASA&rsquo;s proposal to set up a parallel tallying centre during the general election.Led by National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale, three CSs, Tana River Governor Hussein Dado and more than 10 MPs and senators allied to JP, the leaders said there cannot be another tallying centre except the IEBC&rsquo;s.&ldquo;The tallying centre by NASA shall not be recognised. The only one accepted is that of the IEBC,&rdquo; Duale said.The Jubilee leaders addressed thousands of supporters in the Malindi Municipal Stadium.They said the IEBC is the only legitimate institution mandated to conduct and announce winners during the election. They said having parallel tallying centres would create conflicts and lead to violence, similar to what was experienced during the 2007-08 post-election violence.Former CIC chairman Charles Nyachae, who was also present, supported Duale and urged NASA pricipal Kalonzo Musyoka to forget about having a parallel tallying centre.He said NASA should accept the results of the August election.Water CS Eugene Wamalwa said Kalonzo is a senior lawyer and should stop any plans of a parallel tallying centre.&ldquo;The 2007-08 post-election violence was not started by President Uhuru Kenyatta or Deputy President William Ruto, but because of lack of confidence in the institutions. Let&rsquo;s not take this country to that direction,&rdquo; he said.Other leaders present were CSs Dan Kazungu (Mining), Mwangi Kiunjuri (Devolution), and politicians from the Coast.Ruto, who was expected at the rally, cancelled the visit at the last minute, despite the high turnout of supporters.It was not immediately clear why the DP did not come.Last week, NASA said it will set up a parallel tallying centre for the August 8 poll results. It said the centre will stop the Jubilee administration from rigging. &ldquo;This time, we&rsquo;ll have our tallying centre,&rdquo; Wiper leader Kalonzo said.ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi said, &ldquo;As things stand, we know the electoral agency [IEBC] is creating ground for a constitutional crisis. We also know Jubilee is working closely with them so Kenyans vote manually.&rdquo;The leaders did not give details about the centre, but said its victory is in sight as it has the numbers to win the upcoming election. They promised to use all means available to ensure Kenyans use an electronic system.The leaders pledged to work together to the end.
