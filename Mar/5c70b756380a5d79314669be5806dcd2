Maasai leaders have warned the government against lifting a caveat imposed on issuance of title deeds of land around the Mau Forest.Led by Narok North MP Moitalel ole Kenta, county ODM vice chairperson Christine Lemein and Narok governor aspirant Joseph Tiampati of ODM, the leaders said the Jubilee administration was plotting to issue title deeds within the Mau as a campaign tool ahead of the August 8 poll.Speaking during an ODM rally at Olpusimoru town at the weekend, the leaders said that if the government does not rescind the intended plan, then the Maasai community will invade the forest. &ldquo;When I heard the government wants to remove the caveat, I talked to the chief land registrar, who told me he was instructed by Lands CS Jacob Kaimenyi. I told him that cannot happen because you cannot give titles to trust land, which is a forest,&rdquo; Kenta said.
