The Treasury has cleared the way for MPs &mdash; the world's second most highly paid lawmakers &mdash; to award themselves Sh2.5 billion for eight months of no work.That's the length of time by which their five-year terms will be cut short by the General Election on August 8.The total sendoff package would be Sh12.9 million for each of the 349 members of the National Assembly and the 62 members of the Senate.Treasury has said the MPs can be paid the millions they have been demanding as long as it's within Parliament's Sh36 billion allocation for 2017-18.Parliament's term expires on August 8.A court case has been filed challenging the severance, but it has not been determined.MPs have been piling pressure on Treasury to allocate money to compensate them for their shorter term.The MPs were sworn in March 2013 and they argue their five-year term should end in March 2018 and not August 7 this year. The remedy they want is payment for "lost" months.If MPs decide to enrich themselves collectively by Sh2.6 billion &mdash; which is likely &mdash; each of 418 lawmakers will take home Sh6.2 million when Parliament is dissolved, pushing their total send-off package to Sh12.9 million.Comment: Eleventh Parliament will go down in annals of infamyMPs will receive gratuity payments of Sh2.8 billion at the end of their term on Election Day, paid straight from the consolidated fund.The MPs will also 'earn' Sh1.09 million salary for two other months of no work.Parliament will be dissolved on June 5, but members have been guaranteed pay through August 7, the day before the polls.In the past, Parliament was dissolved 60 days ahead of the polls but the 2010 Constitution says Parliament's term runs to the day of the next election.The only money MPs will not receive during their recess of seven weeks is sitting allowance.It all started from December last year.Five days to Christmas, MPs raided public coffers and added Sh5 billion to their send-off package. This raised the budget ceiling from Sh31 billion proposed by Treasury to Sh36 billion.The powerful Budget and Appropriations Committee had argued the money was to cater for parliamentary staff at the constituency offices, who have a five-year contract with the Parliamentary Service Commission.The staff are entitled to a gratuity at the end of the five-year termHowever, the Treasury and the budget committee struck a deal on February 6 &mdash; the gratuity for staff will not come from the PSC but from National Budget estimates to be presented tomorrow.Treasury's decision by the Treasury to budget for the gratuity for the hundreds of contracted staff was seen as a &lsquo;scheme&rsquo; to indirectly validate the MPs' budget surge."National Treasury reassured the chairman there was a line budget for them," read minutes of the meeting attended by Finance CS Henry Rotich and PS Kamau Thugge.However, to meet MPs' demands for severance pay, the Treasury during a meeting with the budget committee on February 6, told MPs the gratuity for the staff will be catered for by the Treasury.The MPs agreed with pleas from the PSC that Rotich&rsquo;s Sh31 billion was insufficient.The 'excess' will finance hefty &ldquo;welcome perks&rdquo; for incoming MPs.According to budget estimates tabled before the National Assembly yesterday, the budget committee appeared to agree with Treasury&rsquo;s proposal to maintain the budget ceiling at Sh36 billion.PS Thugge last Wednesday told the committee they must maintain Parliament&rsquo;s budget cap at Sh36 billion, not Sh40 billion that PSC proposed.&ldquo;We hope they will stick with the Sh36 billion budget ceiling so we don&rsquo;t cut other expenditures,&rdquo; Thugge had said.The PSC has been allocated Sh11.7 billion for recurrent expenditure and Sh3.1 billion for development expenditure, bringing the total to Sh14.8 billion.The Senate, which has a separate vote, has no allocation for development expenditure, making its allocation for the next financial yearSh5.7 billion.The National Assembly has been allocated Sh21.1 billion for recurrent expenditure.The PSC budget shows allowances paid to MPs will jump from Sh4.5 billion in the current year to Sh7.2 billion in the year starting this July.They will then drop to Sh4.6 billion in the year starting July 2018, signaling an explained expenditure of Sh2.6 billion tied to MPs&rsquo; end-of-term severance pay."We discussed this with the budget committee two days ago and agreed with the earlier ceiling of Sh36 billion, which didn&rsquo;t include severance pay. That is our position as the Treasury and we hope MPs will stick to that position when they debate the budget committee report for 2017-18 estimates,&rdquo; Thugge told a breakfast meeting with Journalists at Intercontinental Hotel last week.The Treasury has also asked Parliament to adjust its budget to make savings for its expenditures.Sh1 billion will come from deferring the purchase of the land for the construction of the Centre for Parliamentary Studies and another Sh500 million by suspending the monitoring and evaluation fund.
