Nyeri Senator Mutahi Kagwe has declared that he will vie for Governor on a Jubilee Party ticket in this year's election.Kagwe made the announcement in his office in the county on Sunday, saying his primary goal was development."We will begin with creating programmes such as e-health and e-agriculture," he said.He added that he will ensure better management of resources and create more opportunities for youths and women.Kagwe had hinted at vying for governor after aspirant Thuo Mathenge asked him to run for re-election and support him for county boss.He told Thuo, who is Brade Gate Poultry Industries owner, to stop panicking as the late Governor had not been buried at the time.The Senator spoke to journalists accompanied by several county leaders, days after new Governor Samuel Wamathai said he will vie for the post.Wamathai, who was Deputy Governor, took over after Nderitu Gachagua died from pancreatic cancer on February 24."Gachagua and I committed ourselves to completing some programmes. That is why I am going to Nairobi to present my papers and defend the seat," Wamathai said.Read more: Samuel Wamathai to defend Nyeri Governor post on Jubilee ticketRead: Wamathai to retain cabinet, finish projects and battle graftMore than five aspirants have so far declared interest in the Nyeri governor seat, a race that is expected to be a battle of billionaires.The others include former director of Vision 2030 Wahome Gakuru, industrialist Githinji Cocorico, hotelier Patrick Munene and Athi Water Services chairman Wachira Keen.More on this: Gachagua's death throws governor aspirants back to drawing board in open raceAlso read: Battle of billionaires in race for Nyeri governor
