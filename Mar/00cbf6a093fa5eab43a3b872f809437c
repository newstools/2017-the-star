Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka has rubbished reports linking him to secret foreign accounts.The NGO board wrote to the Kalonzo Musyoka Foundation for breaching regulations through "illegal and unauthorised" operations of foreign accounts.In a March 1 letter signed by board executive director Fazul Mahamed, the said account is the sole recipient of millions in foreign currency from donors oversees."In addition, the foreign currency account has also been used for conversation of Kenya shillings and subsequent crediting to the foundation bank accounts," the letter reads.Kalonzo's is the second foundation to be put on the spot by the NGO board after Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero's.But Kalonzo said the reports are malicious, false and baseless. He said it is a strategy by Jubilee to dent his chances of clinching the Nasa presidential ticket.Read: Raila will not let Kalonzo fly NASA presidential flag, says Gichugu MP"These people just realised that Kalonzo is becoming more and more popular. This is just a strategy to derail my chances and it is bound to fail," he said on Saturday.He was addressing public rallies at Kinna and Garba-Tulla trading centres in Isiolo counties.Kalonzo defended his foundation saying it has benefited more than 2,000 students from underprivileged backgrounds across the country.He said operations are above board and wondered why the press would disseminate such a report without informing him first."To prove their mischief, Jubilee decided to send the false report to the media to ensure bad publicity instead of the procedural process of serving the affected party first," he said.Kalonzo brought on stage a young man from Kinna village, now in Mt Kenya University, who was a direct beneficiary of the foundation."You see this young man here? He is benefiting from the foundation. But instead of Jubilee helping such young people, it is busy stealing from public coffers," he said.He also questioned why the government would involve itself in a private foundation where it had no direct interests.Kalonzo lashed out at the government for ignoring the plight of the residents and other marginalised groups in the country.He also accused Jubilee of ignoring 420 IDPs living in the area, while compensating victims from other regions.He was accompanied by Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang'ula, Wiper Deputy leader Farah Maalim and Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana among other leaders.Wetang'ula accused Jubilee of reneging on its promises to Kenyans, including failure to provide laptops to pupils and for abetting tribalism and corruption.He said Jubilee rigged itself into power in 2013 but warned that no further rigging would be tolerated in the forthcoming elections.He said the NASA brigade had stuck together despite hopes from Jubilee that they would separate before the general election.&ldquo;Jubilee is only good at corruption and theft. It has perpetrated a Government of only two tribes&hellip;we want a Government that is all inclusive,&rdquo; Wetangula said.Both Kalonzo and Wetang'ula reiterated that they would be steadfast and united in NASA.Maalim urged residents to support NASA. He told other co-principals to support Kalonzo for the NASA presidential ticket.His sentiments were supported by Kibwana who said Kalonzo was fit to lead Kenya.
