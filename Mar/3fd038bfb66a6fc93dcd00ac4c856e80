South Korean prosecutors said on
Monday they will seek a detention warrant for ousted President
Park Geun-hye, who has been accused of taking bribes from big
businesses. Park, 65, became South Korea's first democratically elected
president to be removed from office when a constitutional court
upheld her parliamentary impeachment this month. Park denies any
wrong doing.
