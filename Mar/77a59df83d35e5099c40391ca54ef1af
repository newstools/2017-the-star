Campaigns for Garissa governor have intensified as the two top contenders hunt for votes in Ijara subcounty. The two — Governor Nathif Jama and Ali Korane — are wooing voters from the Samawadhal community, in the southern part of the county. Analysts say the Samawadhals have the deciding vote in the August poll. According to the IEBC figures, the community has about 20,000 votes. Jama concluded his tour of Masalani and Holugho subcounties on Monday. He initiated several projects and distributed relief food to hunger-stricken residents. Jama is an Aulian, but his deputy Hussein Abdullahi is from the area. He expressed confidence that he will be reelected for his second. Jama cited his development record as the basis for his reelection bid. On Saturday, Korane, an Abduwak, is expected to hold a rally in Masalani town. The meeting is to formalise the Telamuge Alliance that brings together the Abduwak and the Samawadhal communities. Korane’s running mate Abdi Omar is from the Samawadhal community. The alliance was mooted at a Nairobi hotel. Leaders from the two communities agreed to rally their supporters to vote hopefuls fronted by the alliance. The Samawadhal community was given the Senate seat and deputy governor position, while the Abduwak got the governor and woman representative seats. Speaking to the Star on the phone on Friday,Garissa Township MP Aden Duale, a fierce critic of the Jama administration, said all roads will lead to Masalani this Saturday. He is backing Korane. “It’ll be a mother of all rallies. This is the team to watch,” Duale said. All camps understand that the votes in the southern part of the county are key to victory.
