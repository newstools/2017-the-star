They said the two will call me,&rdquo; Njenga told the Star on the phone. He added that he is confident he would win the nomination for the seat held by GG Kariuki.Njenga&rsquo;s brother Maina Njoroge said a man identified only as Limo declined to receive the papers.Njenga said two weeks ago he would &ldquo;take power by force&rdquo; if the party refused to give him the nomination.He has promised the residents of Laikipia he will end cattle rustling at the Laikipia-Baringo border. He also said he will conduct road shows to teach the public why it is important for communities to live peacefully.In the run up to the 2013 general elections, Njenga said his support for Cord leader Raila Odinga was informed by his calls for reforms. &ldquo;My presidential candidate is Raila and I will not change my stance. I believe he will bring the change we have been advocating for,&rdquo; he said.
