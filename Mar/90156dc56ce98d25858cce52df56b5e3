A man who confessed to killing Kiru Boys&rsquo; High School principal Solomon Mwangi was yesterday jailed for seven years. Joseph Kariuki&rsquo;s murder charge was reduced to manslaughter after he told the court he was remorseful, as his actions were only motivated by the money he was offered. He pleaded with the court for leniency and a non-custodial sentence. Kariuki has offered to testify in the murder trial of Solomon Mwangi&rsquo;s widow and another person.Judge Joel Ngugi said he sentenced Kariuki to seven years because he agreed to be a witness. He faced between 10 to 15 years in jail. The prosecution urged the court not to reveal the prison Kariuki will be taken because of his status as a witness in a murder case. Kariuki told the court he and his accomplice were promised Sh400,000, but they were only paid Sh100,000.After the murder, Mwangi&rsquo;s widow Jane Muthoni and her accomplice switched off their phones, he said. Kariuki said he had second thoughts about killing Mwangi, but he did it when Muthoni insisted. &ldquo;I am scared every time I remember the death of the principal. I was motivated by money and I did not look at the man as he died, which still haunts me,&rdquo; he said.Muthoni and Isaack Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a have denied murdering Mwangi between November 6 and 11 last year in a coffee plantation in Juja. Their cases will be heard on May 8. Kariuki&rsquo;s lawyer John Kamau told the court his client has apologised to Mwangi&rsquo;s family and his plea agreement to manslaughter came from the heart. He said Kariuki voluntarily cooperated with the police and the prosecution to solve the case and led them to the real culprits. &ldquo;He has a young family and is the sole breadwinner. He wishes he could one day go back to them,&rdquo; Kamau said. Mwangi&rsquo;s family representative Fr Gerishon Kuria said they have left it to the court to decide.
