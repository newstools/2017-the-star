Liverpool&rsquo;s hopes for the Merseyside derby have taken a huge knock after Adam Lallana was ruled out by an injury picked up playing for England.Footage emerged on Tuesday of Lallana rubbing his left thigh in discomfort after the first half of the 2-0 win against Lithuania on Sunday, but he saw out the full 90 minutes. The injury grew steadily worse over the following 24 hours and he could be sidelined for four weeks. He has undergone treatment at Liverpool&rsquo;s Melwood training base but there is no hope of him being involved in the clash against Everton on Saturday or the subsequent games at home to Bournemouth (April 5) and away to Stoke (April 8).It is a huge blow for Jurgen Klopp as Lallana, who has scored seven times and contributed seven assists in the Premier League, has been instrumental in helping Liverpool push for a top four spot.What is all the more galling for Klopp is that it is the second time Lallana has returned from England duty this season with an injury - back in November, he damaged his groin in a 2-2 draw with Spain.That injury forced him to miss three matches but this issue could be much longer and it leaves Klopp with mounting concerns ahead of the showdown with their neighbours.As the issue happened while he was playing with England, Liverpool will be able to claim back his wages, which are in the region of &pound;100,000 (Sh12.7m), thanks to the FIFA club protection programme.Klopp is anxiously waiting to see if Jordan Henderson, Liverpool&rsquo;s captain who has been absent for almost four weeks, responds from treatment in time to be in contention to take Lallana&rsquo;s place in midfield.He also has the headache of waiting to see what condition Roberto Firmino, Liverpool&rsquo;s leading striker, returns from Brazil as he missed training in Sao Paolo with a throat inflammation.Fenway Sports Group, Liverpool&rsquo;s owners, have hired a private jet to get Firmino and Philippe Coutinho back in time so they can train today but it is a far from ideal situation.Daniel Sturridge, meanwhile, has not yet returned to full training following a hip problem; even if he was to begin training again in the next 48 hours, he would only be fit enough to take a place on the bench.Lallana&rsquo;s absence, though, is the one that will be most keenly felt and it will at least provide some balance for Everton, who have fitness issues of their own.Seamus Coleman, of course, is facing a long road back after suffering an horrific leg break playing for the Republic of Ireland against Wales last Friday, while James McCarthy is sidelined with a hamstring problem.Morgan Schneiderlin will also be unavailable, having pulled his calf in the 4-0 win over Hull before the international break. He is responding to treatment but is unlikely to make Everton&rsquo;s game at Old Trafford next Tuesday, either.
