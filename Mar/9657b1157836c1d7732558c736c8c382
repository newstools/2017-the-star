A cemetery is supposed to be the final resting place for the deceased in urban areas. However, many bodies in major towns are no longer at ease. After tens of thousands of burials, space is running out and desperate measures are being taken to accommodate fresh burials. Today, we look at Nakuru, where residents fear selling land to the government for burials, and Eldoret, where cemetery staff accuse the county government of neglect. Shrinking space for burials prompted the Nakuru government to propose last year that residents cremate the bodies of their loved ones. The idea has met more resistance than acceptance.Different ethnic groups have different customs, making it hard to convince them to cremate bodies.Resident Robert Kigen said: "The population is increasing. The more we keep burying, the more land will go. It will reach a certain time when we will not have enough space to live.&rdquo;However, he said cremation interferes with spirits and the ghost of the dead.Bishop Abraham Gitu said: &ldquo;I will not comment on the matter because it is sensitive. I want to do my research first.&rdquo; Resident Mary Moraa said some people are open-minded. &ldquo;Rural ancestral homes are the traditional burial places for most Kenyans, but some are now breaking away from the custom and opting for cremation, which means they do not perform ritual and religious burial rites."LAND ELUSIVEThe Nakuru government is seeking to acquire 65 acres to address the cemetery congestion.Last year, efforts to secure land were frustrated by communities objecting to the establishment of the cemetery near their homes.Governor Kinuthia Mbugua said the county is seeking a minimum of 65 acres in Nakuru, 10 in Naivasha and five in Mai Mahiu.Health executive Mungai Kabii said the county has not identified land for a new cemetery.&ldquo;Most people are afraid to sell us the land because they do not want to live near a cemetery or have their land border it,&rdquo; he said.The government has made little progress in resolving a problem it inherited from previous administrations, then called municipal, county (rural) and urban councils. Five years after cemeteries were declared full, new public cemeteries are yet to be built, even after the first county government was installed.The now-defunct Nakuru municipal council started the search in earnest in 2011, but suitable land is yet to be found. There are several graves which have filled up, including Nakuru North cemetery, which has 27 Commonwealth graves from World War I and 45 from World War II.During the Second World War there was a Royal Air Force Flying Training School in Nakuru and various camps and establishments in and near the town. These included an OCTU in Njoro and another in Londiani.The cemetery now contains 27 Commonwealth burials of the First World War and 45 from the Second World War.Most graves at the Nakuru North cemetery date from November 1918 and were made from the convalescent camps at Nakuru. A notice from Public Health officer Samuel Kingori two years ago declared them full.The town&rsquo;s only other such facility, the Nakuru South cemetery, has virtually no space left. The matter has been worrying the county.King'ori said it is difficult for the county to find land to buy.&ldquo;Residents fear selling us land because they do not want to live near the cemetery or have their land border the cemeteries,&rdquo; he said.NEMA CITES PROTOCOLThe National Environment Management Authority has always refuted claims that it is to blame for the long delay in the acquisition of land for a public cemetery in Nakuru.They have said that before a piece of land is approved for such a purpose, several procedures must be followed.The law also requires that a soil type assessment be done to establish whether it can allow for speedy body decomposition. The land should not be marshy or rocky.King'ori said the law also says a cemetery should not be near water bodies to avoid pollution.&ldquo;A cemetery is a disposal ground for human waste and like any other waste, it requires proper disposal. It is not Nema that obstructs or derails license acquisition,&rdquo; a Nema officer said.He said apart from soil assessment, a cemetery's location needs not inconvenience any member of the public.&ldquo;Before approval of a cemetery land, there should also be acceptance by the members of the public as failure to this, anyone has the right to go to court and challenge the decision by Nema,&rdquo; he said.The officer said it is not easy to identify land with &ldquo;strong&rdquo; soil, as required by the law.Nakuru county has allocated Sh40 million in each of the last three years for cemetery land, but prospects remain remote.&ldquo;Some people are hiking prices to discourage the county from buying the land, while some are totally opposed to the idea of a cemetery near their homes,&rdquo; said Kingori.He said despite placing an advertisement on dailies tendering for suitable land for the last four years, no one is willing to sell. This comes even as the county is struggling to dispose of at least 100 unclaimed bodies.TAMING DEMANDA few years ago, the county attempted to discourage residents from using the Nakuru North cemetery by hiking burial charges from Sh5,000 to Sh20,000 per burial site, but it did not solve the problem.The Naivasha town cemetery is already full. Residents are now burying their loved ones at Longonot and Gilgil cemeteries, which are almost full, according to King'ori.In Elburgon, Molo and Njoro, the cemeteries are already full."There's a time the municipality sold land surrounding the cemetery land, only for residents to dig out the skulls when ploughing the land,&rdquo; resident Mary Njoki said. "They decided to leave it and search for a different piece of land far away."Another resident, John Kamau, said: &ldquo;After the main cemetery in Elburgon was declared full, the council identified some land a kilometre from the old one. That is where residents are burying their relatives, and it might be full in the next two years because it is the only one remaining in the entire subcounty.&rdquo;In Bahati constituency, residents say Engashura cemetery is also almost full.King&rsquo;ori said the Public Health department issued a notice on June 21 last year that full cemeteries would be closed and those that continue burial would be fined Sh1,500 for each grave.Despite being closed, though, the cemeteries are still receiving fresh bodies, with new graves being dug beside others, on footpaths or over old ones and along perimeter fences.Some residents have accused grave diggers of digging on top of previous graves."The grave diggers are abusing the rights of the dead, as we all know the cemetery was closed more than two years ago," Njoki said.However, Nakuru North cemetery grave digger John Chege said: &ldquo;Most of the time we do not have a job to do. The only people who bury their families here are those who had booked graves in advance for their families.&rdquo; He said in a month, they can receive three or four bodies to bury, so it has been hard to feed their families.CEMETERIES DREADEDSome of the challenges include taboos among locals who hinder purchase of land, as some feel uncomfortable when a cemetery is located near their homes.Resident Joel Orino says the main problem is the public perception on cemeteries and dumping sites.&ldquo;Cemeteries are not properly managed, so nobody wants to live near them,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Some people are hiking prices to discourage the county from buying the land, while some are totally opposed to the idea of a cemetery near their homes.&rdquo;A bid to acquire land for the cemetery in Mangu area by the Nakuru government continues to face resistance, as residents increasingly contest the development.Securing a site for a new cemetery now remains a key priority for Mbugua, whose government says it is committed to acquiring land soonest possible.County secretary Joseph Motari said he had signed an expression of interest towards the purchase.&ldquo;We are doing everything possible to ensure that it is obtained,&rdquo; he said.He said negotiations are ongoing.A human rights director, David Kuria, also expressed concern over the state of affairs.&ldquo;The grave diggers are abusing the rights of the dead as the cemetery was closed more than five years ago,&rdquo; he said.In 2011, Nakuru was cited by the UN Habitat as one of the fastest-growing and cleanest towns in East Africa.Residents have attributed the lag in developing a cemetery for Nakuru to prevailing stereotypes associated with the dead.
