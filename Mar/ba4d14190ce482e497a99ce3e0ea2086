Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho yesterday denied allegations that he forged his KCSE certificate to get admitted to the University of Nairobi.The governor, through his aide Richard Chacha, said Jubilee forged documents to frame him and suit its narrative that he is dishonest, unqualified and ineligible for election.Chacha said only the University of Nairobi can provide the actual position and &ldquo;Jubilee&rsquo;s splashed documents should not be relied upon.&rdquo;Jubilee says Joho presented a forged 1992 exams result slip with a mean grade C+ (plus) for a Bachelor of Commerce degree course in Human Resource Management.Juma Hamid, however, said he was the governor&rsquo;s classmate when Mohamed Ali was the Serani Secondary School headmaster.Hamid said they sat the KCSE exam in 1993, adding that Joho was a cheerful student. He said Jubilee&rsquo;s latest accusations are political.Hamid said the governor was being called Hassan Ali.He said Joho did not reveal his results to him. &ldquo;Joho was an average student. These reports are just propaganda. How can they claims he was not in class?&rdquo; Hamid asked.Anania Mwaboza, Jubilee&rsquo;s deputy governor candidate for Mombasa, said Joho&rsquo;s actual grade was D- (minus).He said Joho attended Serani Secondary School and sat the KCSE exam in 1993. Mwaboza said Joho did not complete his O levels in 1992 as purported.&ldquo;It is proven that he deliberately forged the 1992 Kenya National Examinations Council KCSE exam result slip portraying a mean grade of C+, which is the minimum admissible qualification for a degree course at the University of Nairobi,&rdquo; Mwaboza said.But Chacha said Joho sat his KCSE exam in 1993 and got a C+ (plus) grade.He said the governor took several other courses after he sat the KCSE exam. &ldquo;The only institution that can cast out doubts over the allegations and lay bare the truth is the University of Nairobi,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;As of now, we are not disputing that he did not attend Serani Secondary, as Mwaboza tries to put it. Actually, from the documents he provided, it clearly shows he sat the KCSE exam there.&rdquo;Mwaboza said the governor registered for exams using the name Ali Hassan, index number 16032/063.He contradicted himself, however, saying the admission book indicated a student named Hassan Ali with admission number 326 was enrolled in February, 22, 1990.Mwaboza said that student was the one who scored D- and his parent&rsquo;s name was Ali Joho of Box 80740. He said Hassan Ali had index number 16032/023.Mwaboza said Joho was admitted at Gretsa University for a Bachelor of Arts in Community Development using the 1993 results.Serani Secondary School deputy principal Charo Fondo declined to comment, saying only principal Abas Ulaya is allowed to address the media.When the Star visited the school, Ulaya was said to have been in an interview. Mwaboza questioned why action has not been taken against Joho.&ldquo;Joho Hassan Ali should be held to account for forgery of a result slip, whose copy he presented to the UoN,&rdquo; he said.Mwaboza claimed Joho attended evening classes at the UoN and sat only two exams.He said the governor abandoned the course midway.
