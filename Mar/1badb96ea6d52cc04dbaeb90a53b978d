An MCA aspirant in Budalang’i, Bunyala subcounty, has urged politicians eyeing elective slots to engage in peaceful campaigns. Budalang’i constituency manager Godfrey Obayi is eyeing the Bunyala North ward MCA seat currently held by Fred Musirimba. He said politicians should stop hiring goons to heckle their opponents. Obayi addressed mourners in Munani village, Ruambwa sublocation, on Wednesday. “We do not want a repeat of the 2007-08 post-election violence that saw innocent Kenyans killed, maimed and displaced,” he said. Obayi urged Bunyala North ward residents and Budalang’i constituency to avoid politicians who promote ethnic violence through hate speech to gain political mileage. “Each aspirant should be allowed to visit any corner of Budalang’i to sell their agenda during campaigns, irrespective of one’s party affiliation,” the aspirant said. He added, “As politicians we should exercise restraint and stop hiring goons to disrupt rallies convened by our rivals.” Obayi pledged to acquire land for a primary school in Munani so that children who walk to Ruambwa Primary School, four kilometers away, are accommodated at the proposed school. He promised to set up a technical training institute at Sibuka in Mudembi sublocation for youth to undertake technical courses of their choice and set up businesses.
