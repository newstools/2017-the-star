The Anti-Corruption Court yesterday gave DPP Keriako Tobiko two weeks to decide whether to drop charges against Machakos Senator Johnson Muthama and others in a Sh179 million Konza Techno City land case, or proceed to full hearing.Muthama, David Ngilai, James Munguti, Leonard Katua and Julius Nzyuko are accused of brokering a deal with Malili Ranch Ltd to buy 5,000 acres on behalf of the government, but failing to pay the firm once the deal went through.The land was for construction of Konza Techno City.Other accused include former ICT PS Bitange Ndemo, Julius Maweu and commissioner Ronald Laboso. The accused are out on Sh1.5 million bail.Ndemo was charged separately with three counts of abuse of office and willful failure to comply with the procurement laws in acquisition of the land.There are 605 members of the ranch.Yesterday, Milimani chief magistrate Lawrence Mugambi took issue with the prosecution&rsquo;s delay of the trial because it is waiting for the outcome of appeals filed by it and the accused.He adjourned the case until March 31, saying there will be no more postponements.Mugambi asked the prosecution, represented by senior state counsel Daniel Karuri, Duncan Ondimu and Lilian Obuor, why they arraigned the accused, yet they are not ready to proceed with the case.He said the case will be withdrawn if the prosecution is not ready on March 31. Mugambi said the prosecution can then take its time to gather evidence and present the case at a later date.Meanwhile, Mugambi withdrew charges against former commissioner of Lands Zablon Mabea. This is after receiving a High Court order terminating the charges on grounds the charges were &ldquo;oppressive, malicious and an abuse of the court process&rdquo;.Muthama moved to the Court of Appeal and obtained a stay order, pending the hearing of his appeal.Muthama challenged his prosecution by lawyer Paul Muite - who was part of the prosecution team - saying he does not work under the Office of the DPP.Konza City had been touted as a future technology and communications hub.It is a project under the Ministry of ICT. Konza City is an approved plan by the government in line with Vision 2030 to create a nation with a high quality of life.
