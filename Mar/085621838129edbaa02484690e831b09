Kigumo MP Jamleck Kamau has dismissed as cooked an opinion poll showing that his rival for Murang a governor race Mwangi Wairia is ahead of him by 14 points.The opinion poll released on Thursday by Trends and Insights for Africa showed 48 per cent would vote for Wairia, compared to Kamau s 34 per cent and Moses Mwangi s six per cent.TIFA director Margy Ireri said 43 per cent preferred Kembi Gitura for senator, compared to MP Irungu Kangata s 31 per cent. Sabina Chege topped the list for woman representative at 70 per cent, with 15 per cent saying they were undecided. This is a cooked opinion poll. It does not reflect the opinions of the people on the ground, Kamau said on the phone yesterday.He said the research firm should explain if there are forces behind the survey. We see that all the governors are leading. We can only conclude that there is some force behind the poll, he said.Other counties polled were Bomet, where Governor Issac Rutto emerged top and Siaya, topped by Governor Cornel Rasanga. It is only in Nandi where the survey showed former minister Henry Kosgey is ahead of incumbent Clophas Lagat.Kamau said some governors have been accused of misusing public funds and will do everything to manipulate the people s opinion.Paradoxically, another opinion poll released on Wednesday by the League of Kenya Women Voters showed Kamau was ahead at 50.6 per cent, while Wairia had 41.1 per cent. A percentage of 8.3 was undecided.For TIFA survey, 500 Murang a residents were polled between February 15-19, while the League of Kenya Women Voters survey involved 2,134 respondents between February 21-28.The League of Women survey showed Gitura is ahead with 47.3 per cent support, while 37.7 per cent believe Kang'ata is best placed as the county's next senator while Peter Njangi (an aspirant) was backed by 1.7 per cent.
