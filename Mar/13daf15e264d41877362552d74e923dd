Some Rift Valley youths have asked Baringo Senator Gideon Moi to stop undermining Deputy President William Ruto.The youths under the Kerio Youths Association, said Ruto is not desperate for support from the Kanu chairman to win the region&rsquo;s votes. Chairman Joel Kimaiyo said residents in Rift Valley are behind the DP and urged Gideon to either support Ruto or stop meddling in Jubilee Party affairs. Kimaiyo questioned why Gideon says he supports the reelection of President Uhuru Kenyatta while undermining the DP.Speaking in Iten on Sunday, the youth said Ruto campaigned without Gideon and delivered at least 95 per cent of votes in Rift Valley to Jubilee in the last general election. &ldquo;In 2013, Ruto ensured Rift Valley residents voted for Jubilee when Gideon was campaigning against the party. But to tell us that he supports the reelection of Uhuru while undermining his deputy is nonsense,&rdquo; Kimaiyo said.He added that opposition leaders are using some individuals in Rift Valley, including Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto, to undermine the DP for selfish gain.&ldquo;Opposition leaders are using Rutto to divide the Kalenjin vote to give NASA an opportunity to win the election,&rdquo; Kimaiyo added. The youth urged politicians to keep off the ongoing security operation in the Kerio Valley. They said those politicising the operation are individuals who either benefit directly or indirectly from cattle rustling.&ldquo;We must get rid of criminal elements among us,&rdquo; he said.
