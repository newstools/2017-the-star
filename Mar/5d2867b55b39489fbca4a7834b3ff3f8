The government has rolled out a deworming drive targeting six million schoolchildren in 19 counties.The children between age six and 14 will be given eight million tablets donated by two drugs manufacturers to eliminate intestinal worms and bilharzia parasites.Various worms and parasites can cause sickness and long-term health damage.The campaign is being managed by the ministries of Health and Education. It targets children aged between six and 14 years.The deworming will be undertaken in Bomet, Bungoma, Garissa, Homa Bay, Kakamega, Kericho, Kirinyaga and Kisumu counties. Others are Kitui, Machakos, Makueni, Migori, Narok, Nyamira, Trans Nzoia, Vihiga, and Wajir.Last week, children in Kisii and Nandi counties were dewormed in the first phase of the campaign.Head of the Neglected Tropical Diseases Unit Dr Sultani Matendechero said the campaign is expected to reduce the general worm load in a community as schoolchildren form about 25 per cent of the population.He urged parents to ensure their children are dewormed, saying it will go a long way to help Kenya meet the global targets of eliminating worms.&ldquo;Preschool children who are able to come for the drugs will not be sent back. There will be provision for them, but their guardians should bring them to the schools, where we conduct the exercise,&rdquo; Matendechero said.He also said the campaign would improve the performance of schoolchildren and improve attendance.Teams have been educating residents on the importance of deworming.In May, the second phase of the drive will target children in Busia, Kilifi, Kwale, Lamu, Mombasa, Siaya, Taita Taveta and Tana River counties.More than eight million tablets for intestinal worms and three million tablets for bilharzia will be distributed in both phases.The drugs, with an estimated market value of more than Sh1 billion, were donated by GSK and the Merck Group.The Children&rsquo;s Investment Fund Foundation, the END Fund and the Evidence Action are supporting the drug distribution.A national mass faecal examination of 27,729 children from 395 schools in 2008 estimated intestinal parasitic worms infections at five million ( 56.8 per cent). Mass school deworming was initiated in 2009. Evidence shows it improves school performance.In October 2012, more than 60,000 primary school pupils in Migori were dewormed. The drive is managed by the ministries of Education and Health in conjunction with an NGO, Innovation Poverty Action.In the same year, the dewormed primary school pupils in Bomet and Chepalungu.
