Machakos Senator Johnson Muthama on Tuesday missed the Kamba leaders&rsquo;meeting in Emali. The leaders came together to pledge their support for Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka&rsquo;s presidential ambition.Muthama is said to have given no reason for his absence, which raised speculation on his commitment towards the leaders&rsquo; agenda. A source conversant with the planning of the event said the senator was invited and everyone kept hoping he would show up.It is rumoured that Muthama has been uncomfortable with Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana&rsquo;s presence since he joined Wiper.Kivutha was behind the idea to bring together all Kamba leaders to support Kalonzo, which reportedly did not go down well with Muthama.Some Wiper leaders said Muthama feels Kivutha is taking his place in Wiper.The senator has been criticised for backing ODM party leader Raila Odinga&rsquo;s candidature instead of Kalonzo. Some say this may have been the reason for his absence.Those at the Emali meeting included Narc leader Charity Ngilu, CCU&rsquo;s Wavinya Ndeti, John Katuku of PTP, Kitui Governor Julius Malombe and senators David Musila and Mutula Kilonzo Jnr. They said anyone against the unity is doomed to fail.Others in attendance were Nairobi Deputy Governor Jonathan Mueke and his Machakos counterpart Bernard Kiala, Machakos woman representative Susan Musyoka and her Makueni counterpart Rose Museo with MPs Daniel Maanzo (Makueni) and Jessica Mbalu (Kibwezi East).Mueke said those who missed the meeting and are against the unity bid should start preparing for their exit. Katuku of PTP said the unity forum was not about an individual but the community.
