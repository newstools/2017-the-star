Deputy President William Ruto&rsquo;s office has been accused of causing sharp divisions among Jubilee Party officials.A section of JP aspirants and officials from Migori county have threatened to defect to ODM unless the DP&rsquo;s office stops interfering with operations.On Thursday during the selection of the party&rsquo;s county election board, the divisions became apparent as two groups allied to Jubilee held separate meetings.One group led by Kuria West MP aspirant Mugendi Sayia and Isebania MCA Charles Nyangi held a meeting at Sunaton Hotel in Migori town.&ldquo;We are not aware if in Migori county we have one or two Jubilee Party groups,&rdquo; Sayia said.Another group led by Makerero MCA Joseph Hoyo held an election in Mabera Social Hall. Hoyo&rsquo;s group said the election, which unveiled nine members for the election board, was the valid one.Returning officer Caroline Daudi said those at Mabera were the bona fide officials.
