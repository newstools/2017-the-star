President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto are expected to attend the first ever domestic sale of clothes made by Kenya&rsquo;s Export Processing Zone.The sale kicks off today at the KICC and ends on Friday. Customers can buy clothes, usually made in the country for export purposes, for between Sh100 and Sh600.On Monday, Industrialisation CS Adan Mohamed announced that 20 per cent of EPZ products would be sold in the local market.He said the clothes to go on sale were not those rejected by the international customers.&ldquo;The sale will be for brand new, top quality clothes only,&rdquo; Mohamed said.The decision by the government is meant to ensure Kenyans get global brands at affordable prices since EPZ products are VAT-exempt.&ldquo;An EPZ is a major economic driver for Kenya, with Sh74 billion total investment. It employs more than 50,000 people,&rdquo; Mohamed said.
