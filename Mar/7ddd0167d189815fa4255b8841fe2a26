Delayed title deed processing and lack of compensation have halted City Hall&rsquo;s Sh300 billion housing project.Public-Private Partnership Urban Renewal &mdash; to build 100,000 units &mdash;was to begin in July last year.The first phase involves 14,000 units in seven old estates.Now City Hall now says &ldquo;documentation&rdquo; issues at the Lands ministry and National Land Commission and tenant compensation have stood in the way.Tenants will be compensated to find alternative, equivalent housing until they can return to new houses.&ldquo;It is basically going on, but there are delays in documentation at the Lands office,&rdquo; Housing executive Tom Odongo said yesterday.&ldquo;After that, we&rsquo;ll go to financial closures because we can&rsquo;t hit the ground running until there is a financial closure for each of the projects. This can&rsquo;t happen without full documentation.&rdquo;Though City Hall has the overall title for parcels on which the high-rise apartments are to be put up, it has to extract titles for specific plots.&ldquo;In Pangani for example, the entire triangle belongs to the county government. But there are police and petrol stations,&rdquo; Odongo said.&ldquo;Therefore, we have to do an excision of that area so it stands alone. We can&rsquo;t carry out development using the head title.&rdquo;In November last year, the county signed a Sh6.1 billion contract with seven private investors, including real estate firms and banks, to construct the houses.The first phase is to cover Old and New Ngara, Pangani, Jeevanjee-Bachelors, Ngong Road Inspectorate staff quarters, Uhuru and Suna Road.Old houses will be demolished and redeveloped to accommodate more tenants.No one is to be evicted.This is a Vision 2030 urban renewal project.
