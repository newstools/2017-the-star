Poor parents in Kiambu county have been urged to ensure their children do not miss lessons and ensure they pass their final exams. Education chief officer Anne Gichohi asked parents and guardians to work extra hard to raise fees. &ldquo;We have a lot of families who depend on casual jobs while others depend on their small businesses. I encourage you to support your children. You never know what the future holds for our child. But much depends on your effort,&rdquo; Gichohi said.She was speaking at Kikuyu Town ward on Wednesday where she issued Sh1 million bursary cheques to 1,500 secondary school, college and university students on behalf of Governor William Kabogo. &ldquo;The large land which children used to inherit from their parents is no longer there. A lot of people are not inheriting anything. The most valuable thing one can inherit is education,&rdquo; Gichohi told residents.She said the government has released Sh60 million bursaries for the county. &ldquo;Each ward will receive Sh1 million&rdquo; Gichohi said. She was with county administrator Stephen Kiiru and area MCA Binary Wainaina. Wainaina, a member of the budget committee, said they propose to increase bursaries to Sh2 million for the 2017-18 financial year.&ldquo;Some students stay home even after getting the bursary fee, because they cannot raise Sh2,000 or Sh 3,000 needed to clear the school fee,&rdquo; the MCA said.
