Deputy Inspector General Joel Kitili has nullified the transfer of nearly 100 cops after it emerged they were moved by a retired senior police officer. Police chiefs at Jogoo House, who asked not to be named, said the director of personnel Stanley Lamai moved the officers two days after the latter's retirement. They said Lamai was not in a position to effect any changes since he officially retired from the police service on Friday last week. On Saturday, a notice purported to be from Lamaiâ€™s office announced the changes affecting 98 officers in the ranks of inspectors and below. Another list of transfers originated from the same office on Sunday last week - being two days after the senior cop had exited. The decision to nullify the changes was reached on Monday when the changes were brought to the attention of Kitili. Some of the reasons for the cancellation was that the office of the DIG, and the National Police Service Commission were not consulted. However, police spokesman George Kinoti on Wednesday said he is not aware of the said nullification. Read: Transferred traffic police to be vetted afresh
