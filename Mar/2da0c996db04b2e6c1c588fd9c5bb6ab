Elders have accused Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya of meddling in Trans Nzoia politics regarding how positions should be shared out in NASA.Oparanya had said Governor Patrick Khaemba of Ford Kenya should defend his seat with running mate Protus Chemonges of ODM. The Senate position was to be left to the ANC&rsquo;s Kipruto arap Kirwa.&ldquo;Oparanya should not come here and tell us who should run for what post. Trans Nzoia people are mature enough to elect their leaders,&rdquo; chairman Peter Masinde said on Tuesday.With the endorsement, it means Khaemba will be forced to part ways with Deputy Governor Stanley Kenei.Kenei is a Ford Kenya member. Senator Henry Ndiema will also be left out.These disclosures come when elders from the Bukusu and the Sabaot communities have been rallying for unity in Trans Nzoia under the Mabanga Accord agreement.The deal was signed to end clashes that were normally witnessed during elections, when only certain communities got slots in the government.On Saturday, Oparanya met ODM delegates to popularise the party in the county, when he said that parties which form NASA will be given equal opportunities to battle it out for seats.The ODM deputy leader also assured aspirants of fair primaries.He dismissed claims that nomination tickets will be given on the basis of the community with the majority in a particular zone. &ldquo;I want to clear the air on the issue of zoning. We are going to have a free and fair nomination and no one will be given direct entry,&rdquo; Oparanya said.ODM is seeking to popularise their party in the region, viewed as a Ford Kenya stronghold. He warned aspirants who are still party hopping from Ford Kenya to ODM and vice versa that they risk being locked out and denied the nomination ticket.Oparanya also said Jubilee does not have the &ldquo;tyranny of numbers&rdquo;. &ldquo;Where in Trans Nzoia, Bungoma, Kajiado, Narok, Kakamega counties is Jubilee Party popular? These are definitely NASA strongholds,&rdquo; he said.
