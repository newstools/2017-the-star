Embattled Tiaty MP Asman Kamama has quit Jubilee Party and will today formally join Maendeleo Chap Chap.The move is seen as a protest to the Jubilee government after he said he was &ldquo;unfairly&rdquo; being targeted by rivals following the ongoing security operation in Baringo.The operation, being led by KDF officers, aims at restoring peace by flushing out bandits who have killed Kerio Valley residents and left many displaced.Kamama will be received by Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua during a meeting for aspirants at Kasarani gymnasium today. &ldquo;Arrangements have been made to receive Honourable Kamama and a number of high-profile leaders are joining the party formally today,&rdquo; said an MCC official who sought anonymity.The controversial Tiaty lawmaker has been under pressure to quit as the chairman of the powerful National Assembly Security Committee. Leaders from Baringo county have accused Kamama of hampering efforts to restore peace in the banditry prone region.However, Kamama last week said if relinquishing his influential position would guarantee peace, then he will step down this week. &ldquo;I have been unfairly accused of insecurity menace in Kerio Valley. Let it be clear that all along I have been at the forefront in spearheading peace and development in the region,&rdquo; the MP said.Kamama has already sent a resignation letter to the National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale. Jubilee is now set to settle on Kamama&rsquo;s replacement this week before the House breaks for a month-long recess to prepare for parties primaries.As the chair of the powerful committee, that offers oversight on national security agencies, Kamama holds huge influence and enjoys trappings of power including four bodyguards, police escort and a government vehicle. Armed police officers protect his immediate family.
