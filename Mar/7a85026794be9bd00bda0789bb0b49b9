Jubilee Party has dismissed as "flimsy and falsified" claims that some of its members have destroyed Chama Cha Mashinani campaign materials.Isaac Rutto, who is Bomet Governor and CCM leader, is said to have claimed that posters and banners belonging to aspirants were being removed ahead of DP William's Ruto's visit on Saturday.But Bernard Mutai, Jubilee's county chairman, said the party cannot engage in "such primitive acts" as it is civilised and organised."Jubilee cannot engage in such petty affairs. We, as a party with strong membership in this region, do not feel threatened in any way by any other party. So why would we remove their posters?" Mutali said."We have never seen posters belonging to another party. If any were removed, they belonged to our party."He further told journalists on Thursday that Rutto's claims were far-fetched.Read: Jubilee Party has no future beyond 2017, says Governor RuttoAlso read: Why Rift Valley is in Jubilee Party to staySotik MP Joyce Laboso and National Water conservation and Pipeline Corporation chairman Julius Kones have also denied the claims.The two, who addressed the press on the DP's visit, said Jubilee respected other parties and could not "stoop so low as to destroy opponent's posters".Laboso said tomorrow's function is purely a Jubilee Party affair, not for aspirants to engage in supremacy battles.Kones said: "Tomorrow marks another day when we shall seek to stamp our authority as a party in the region and prove we in Bomet are still in Jubilee."He said they were not members of any other parties as claimed by some politicians in the region.Preparations for Ruto's tour are at an advanced stage. County commissioner Bernard Leparmarai warned rivals against causing disorder.Leparmarai said security officers were alert and that anyone who would try to breach peace would face the law.Ruto is set to inspect development projects, launch the tarmacking of a road in Bomet Central and address a major rally at Bomet stadium.
