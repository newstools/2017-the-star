MEMBERS of the 11th Parliament will go into annals of infamy as the most expensive burden of legislators for the struggling Kenyan taxpayer ever.Parliamentarians have allocated themselves close to Sh2.5 billion in the national Budget to be unveiled Thursday as severance pay and compensation for the reduced term.They have struck a severance deal with Treasury to cover the eight-month reduction of the usual five-year term that should ideally have ended in March 2018.Clearly, the MPs will be paid for no work done. Their action will be an affront to Article 232(1)(b) as violation of the value and principle of public service requiring efficient, effective and economic use of resources.The helpless National Treasury will need the very MPs to pass the Finance Bill 2017 &ndash; which can only happen if the MPs are allocated their generous perks.But the huge expenditure on MPs raises fundamental questions that yearn for missing answers.First, are MPs supposed to assume the powers of the Salaries and Remuneration Commission to decide their own salaries and allowances? No. Even without the SRC, MPs cannot be judges in their own case!Second, the precedent MPs are setting is unsustainable for the debt-ridden and struggling economy amid ever-rising inflation.MPs will earn unreasonably higher than highly qualified public servants in other sectors.What is most intriguing is that the sendoff package is pegged on per term served &ndash; meaning MPs who have served for long terms like GG Kariuki and Dr Oburu Oginga will have received multiple packages over the years.The legal framework is equally weak. The sendoff package assumes MPs will not be contesting for reelection. It&rsquo;s also a contradiction in that after denying ex-PM Raila Odinga and ex-VP Kalonzo Musyoka their retirement perks on account of remaining politically active, the MPs are paying themselves! The precedent is being adopted by MCAs and even public servants. This will push up the recurrent expenditure and public wage bill even higher.Thirdly, our MPs with an appetite for higher pay will also complicate the democratic space for new political entrants. With a war chest of tens of millions in severance pay and sendoff packages in addition to their savings, CDF looting and pensions, serving MPs earnings will skew the August 8 political competition in the incumbents&rsquo; favour.Fourth, the focus will be on President Kenyatta&rsquo;s elusive promise of keeping the cost of living in check.Secretary General Consumers Federation of Kenya
