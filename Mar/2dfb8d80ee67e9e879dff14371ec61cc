The Kenya Sevens Rugby team could only pick five points in the Vancouver sevens after losing to Samoa 26-7 in the Challenge Trophy semi final.The national side has now dropped to 12th place in the RIB rankings with forty points. At the start of the season, head coach Innocent Simiyu had set a target of ten points in each tournament, but after six tournaments, the team is 20 points of the mark with four legs to go. Simiyu's expectations of 100 points at the end of the season now seem impossible. In the match against Samoa, Kenya trailed Samoa 14-0 at half time, but Sammy Oliech reduced the deficit after the break to 14-7.Samoa remained in firm control, adding two more tries to win and proceed to the final. Earlier, Kenya had beaten Scotland 19-17 in the challenge trophy quarter finals. Shujaa appeared to be heading out as Scotland led 17-7 in the second half, but tries from Frank Wanyama and Dan Sikuta were enough to power Kenya into the semis.The team jets back on Tuesday at 9.50pm with Billy Odhiambo who was the only injury for head coach Innocent Simiyu. Odhiambo was injured during the Las Vegas Sevens and was forced to sit out during the Vancouver Sevens. He remains confident he will be available for Hong Kong and Singapore Sevens where Kenya is set to defend their title. Odhiambo is expected to undergo scans this week to reveal the extend nature of the injury.
