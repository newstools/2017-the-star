Nyeri billionaire and philanthropist Ephraim Maina has been criticised for flying in his private chopper to Kieni to launch a Sh100,000 wooden bridge, which he funded.The Nyeri Senate aspirant landed in his chopper on Saturday afternoon at Kabaru ward, Kieni East, where he started his campaigns by officially opening the Kinyua Wa Mweru-Gachini bridge.He was hosted by area MCA Duncan Gituanja, the Nyeri county assembly majority leader.Gituanja said more than five months since the bridge collapsed and the county government did not rebuild it, he approached Maina who funded the temporary structure.But some Kenyans on social media questioned why he was burning chopper fuel for such a small event.Eustus Gitonga said, &ldquo;Engineer wasted his chopper fuel to launch a wooden bridge? It&rsquo;s the 21st century. Don&rsquo;t see the good job there.&rdquo;Blogger Robert Alai asked why Maina burned so much money to launch a wooden bridge.Samson Maina said, &ldquo;A whole engineer flying to a village to launch a wooden bridge and cutting a string &mdash; God deliver us.&rdquo;But Priscilla Faru says that since he used his own money and not the county government&rsquo;s or the CDF, there is nothing wrong and people should be grateful.&ldquo;Those criticising [him] should show us what they have built, with the little money they have, for the community,&rdquo; she said.Maina wa Karatina urged those faulting Maina to work hard and buy their own choppers.But Gituanja said those criticising the project are not area residents.Maina said he funded the bridge to help the community members who have been using long routes to reach the other side of the road.&ldquo;Gituanja approached me to help the community, as the schoolchildren could not cross over and agriculture products were rotting in the farm because buyers could not access the road,&rdquo; the aspirant said.Maina added that to build a permanent house one should started with a thatched-roof house. He defended funding a wooden bridge, saying bridges all over the world are built using materials that are locally available.&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter how I arrived. What matters is that I helped the local community. More people should help build more projects instead of criticising,&rdquo; Maina added.Gituanja and Maina later visited squatters in the colonial villages.
