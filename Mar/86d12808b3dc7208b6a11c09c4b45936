A Miami, Florida defense attorney's pants burst into fire in the middle of the courtroom while he was defending an arson case. Defense lawyer Stephen Gutierrez, 28, was in the midst of his closing argument when the pocket fire which he is said to have attributed to a faulty e-cigarette battery started.Gutierrez was stating that his client did not intentionally set his car on fire, but that instead, the car had spontaneously combusted, when smoke suddenly began to issue forth from his right pants pocket, witnesses told the Miami Herald. Gutierrez hurried out of the courtroom, according to stunned spectators. He did not reenter until the jurors were escorted out, according to observers. Back in the courtroom and apparently unharmed, but sporting a newly-singed pocket, Gutierrez is said to have insisted that the fire near his loins was definitely not part of a staged defense demonstration gone awry. Instead, witnesses say that Gutierrez claimed the cause of the trouser conflagration was an e-cigarette's faulty battery. Prior to addressing jurors for his closing argument, Gutierrez was seen fidgeting with something in his pocket. It was surreal, an observer told the Miami Herald. A lot of people could have been hurt, another court observer said. Miami-Dade police and prosecutors are now investigating what happened, with officers seizing multiple frayed e-cigarette batteries as evidence. According to the Miami Herald, over the next few days, Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Michael Hanzman will have the option of deciding whether to hold Gutierrez in contempt of court for the flaming interruption.Gutierrez was representing his client Claudy Charles, 48, who was accused of purposely setting fire to his in South Miami-Dade.Despite the day's courtroom drama, jurors convicted Charles of second-degree arson. There have been several cases of e-cigarette-related pants fires in recent years, often resulting in people being hospitalized for serious burns.
