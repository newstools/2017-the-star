Leaders and voters in Kieni constituency are trying to persuade former Internal Security minister Chris Murungaru to run for MP. They have been pressuring Murungaru since last week after MP contender Njoroge Wainaina joined Nyeri governor aspirant Mutahi Kagwe as his running mate. On Friday, Wainaina announced he will join Kagwe in the governor’s race, leaving voters confused. Murungaru left active politics 10 years ago and on Monday said he has been receiving many calls and people have been visiting him in Nairobi, urging him to run. “I’m still consulting since I was surprised. The pressure is building by the day. I’m considering,” he told the Star on the phone. Murungaru said he will soon announce whether he will run for MP.
