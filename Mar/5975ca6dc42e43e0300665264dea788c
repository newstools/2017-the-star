I don't want to just be an entertainer. I want to be able to just sit and move a crowd with my voice. Music is how I tell you who I am."Elvis Marvin-24"My inspiration is life and i started singing when i was 9 years old. Joined the church choir and since then I've been growing and learning on my own from Youtube and people I look up to. Whats makes me unique is how I interpret my music."Pedo Brian- 25"I think music is everything to me. My whole life is music, written songs for people too. My plan is to write my own music coz I'm a writer. I want to be able to express myself as a writer and sing my own story, do an album and get myself out there."Watch #TheSearch this weekend on Kiss TV, Sunday at 8PM to catch all the excitement that every musical Kenyan is talking about.
