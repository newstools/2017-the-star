President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s recent call for elected leaders to take a pay and allowances cut after the general election should be supported.The latest news of a Sh36 billion severance package for members of the bicameral Parliament dramatically reinforces the case for supporting the President&rsquo;s call.Alone among Kenyans with gainful employment, parliamentarians write their own pay cheques, invariably against the background of extortionate threats not to pass the national Budget or some such.Other professional cadres look at what Kenyan MPs earn and make escalated pay rise demands, resulting in massive industrial action such as the frequent teachers and doctors&rsquo; strikes.Parliamentarians&rsquo; pay and allowances have a serious knock-on effect on society. They cause wage inflation and the bizarre brain drain now being witnessed as academics quit their jobs and seek election as governors, MPs, senators and even MCAs.Four hundred parliamentarians have given themselves Sh36 billion where 5,000 doctors were denied Sh12 billion.And they include MPs who have taken serial golden handshakes.
