A house help was on Monday jailed three years after pleading guilty to stealing Sh500,000 from her employer. Mary Winiti, 29, fled to Kakamega after stealing the money from Priscilla Kerubo at Harambee estate in NairobiÂ on November 6, 2016. The prosecution told a Makadara court that the complainant was at a church service at the time the money was stolen. The court was told that Kerubo, a businesswoman, had locked her bedroom where the money was before leaving for church. Her husband went shopping for the children. "She (Winti) feigned sickness when she was asked to join the other family members for the service," the prosecution said. Kerubo found the doors to her house open when she returned at 7pm. "I found the bedroom broken into and the Sh500,000 missing. We traced Winiti to Kakamega," she said. She was arrested, through the help of her chief, and brought back to Nairobi for prosecution. In her mitigation before senior principal magistrate Angelo Kithinji, Winiti told the court that she was remorseful. The accused said that she only stole a little money out of the Sh3 million she claimed she saw in the bedroom. "I ask the court to forgive me since I am from a poor family. The money I stole has helped me build a house for my parents," she said.
