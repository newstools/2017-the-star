The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission has received an additional Sh2.1 billion from the budget, compared to last financial year&rsquo;s allocation.This is meant to support its operations for the August 8 election.National Treasury CS Henry Rotich yesterday announced that the Wafula Chebukati-led team has been given Sh21.4 billion in the 2017-18 budget.Last year, it got Sh19.3 billion.This will enable it to deliver a free, fair and credible poll.&ldquo;We are all aware Kenya will be going for election in August. The government is committed to a free and fair election,&rdquo; he said, reading the Sh2.6 trillion budget in Parliament.Rotich presented the budget much earlier than the traditional June because the August poll would interfere with the budget-making calendar.The extra allocation to the IEBC will enable the commission to acquire election materials, educate voters and deal with a possible presidential run-off or disputes.President Uhuru Kenyatta, during his State of the Nation address in Parliament two weeks ago, affirmed his administration&rsquo;s commitment to a free and fair election.Uhuru pointed out proper elections laws put in place to ensure transparency and accountability in the management of elections.&ldquo;As we approach the poll, I wish to remind Kenyans to uphold peace and remain united. Elections are a one-time event, but Kenya is larger than all of us, and shall, and must, remain. Those seeking political office must desist from any utterances that may divide Kenyans along ethnic, religious or other lines,&rdquo; he said.The security sector is among the biggest beneficiaries of the budget, with billions of shillings allocated to police and military modernisation and improved security operations.Rotich allocated Sh8.1 billion for leasing Police Service vehicles, Sh24.8 billion for police and military modernisaton and Sh12 billion for enhanced security operations.He said heavy investment in the security sector has tremendously reversed security threats, especially from terrorism.&ldquo;This has seen the tourism sector make a strong comeback, with increased employment,&rdquo; Rotich said.He said in Nairobi, robberies fell by 32 per cent between 2014 and 2016, while motor vehicle thefts fell by 43 per cent. The CS said offences targeting individuals also fell by 27 per cent.
