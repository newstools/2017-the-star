Cancer survivors say the Sh700 million budget allocation for cancer is welcome but can only treat 2,000 patients.About 40,000 patients are diagnosed annually.This is the first time the government has created a specific fund for cancer care. Some Families fund-raise, while others sell their property to raise money for cancer treatment. David Makumi, chairman of the Kenya Network of Cancer Organisations, said a Sh350,000 capitation limit is very conservative. He said diagnostics, staging, chemo, radio, surgery, pathology, imaging, and follow-up means the proposed allocation can only treat 2,000 patients.The disease, kills about 15,000 Kenyans every year, according to the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics. Makumi said patients and survivors appreciate the gesture but hope the government will increase the sum. Sh700 million is not enough to set up and operate one comprehensive cancer centre. Since 2013 the government has spromised to build four cancer centres. &ldquo;The amount [Sh700 million] cannot even vaccinate all 9-12-year-olds who need HPV vaccine nationally. Maternal health was allocated Sh4.3 billion. These are the same mothers dying of breast, cervical and other cancers,&rdquo; Makumi said. Treasury CS Henry Rotich said the 2017-18 budget aims to deliver a better life for Kenyans. &ldquo;The government continues to implement programmes to ensure Kenyans have access to safe, quality and cost-effective health services,&rdquo; Rotich said.In his state of the nation address last month, President Uhuru Kenyatta said he understands cancer is expensive to treat. &ldquo;Many of us have had to endure requests for contributions towards medical costs. All of us know that the expenses of treating major chronic diseases have bankrupted families,&rdquo; he said.
