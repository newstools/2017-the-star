Farmers in Laikipia have asked the government to intensify the disarmament of illegal firearm holders in northern Kenya.The exercise started last month after herders shot Laikipia West OCPD Merengo Moherai in the chest when he led an operation to recover animals stolen from Kifuku ranch.Various estimates place the number of illegal firearms in Baringo, Isiolo, Samburu and other counties neighbouring Laikipia at 25,000, mostly in the hands of pastoralists.Laikipia Farmers&rsquo; Association says the mop-up of these illegal firearms is now a priority.The farmers spoke following escalation of invasions by armed herders.&ldquo;This is not the first time there is drought. It is also an election year. The invasions started in May last year, but we didn't have drought at that time,&rdquo; association chairman Martin Evans says.TWO SETS OF LAWSEvans says the government appears to have one set of laws for Kenyans in the north, who move around with illegal weapons, and another for the rest of Kenyans.Since mid-last year, the herders have driven thousands of livestock into private farms and ranches, destroying property and killing people.&ldquo;Most of the livestock being driven around does not even belong to pastoralists but to a few individuals who pay the herders.&rdquo;The farmers noted there is escalation of cattle theft in Laikipia because the raiders are often armed and, therefore, face little resistance.Martin suggests the government should also enforce the number of livestock per acre of land that pastoralists can keep.Overgrazing usually reduces animal performance and causes long-term damage to rangelands.Dr Dino Martins, head of Mpala Research Centre in Laikipia, says land in the county and most of northern Kenya can only support one livestock per 10 acres.Experts calculate this ratio mainly by considering the amount of forage the land produces in one year, the average weight of one animal, and the daily utilisation rate.Dino says this is a sociopolitical crisis that will need a long-term ecological solution.&ldquo;If we don't solve it, we will continue to have pockets of insecurity across Kenya. The rangelands are becoming more and more degraded,&rdquo; he says.He says if stocking levels are not adhered to, then after degrading Laikipia, the herders will move towards Meru and Nyeri in future, where grass is lusher.ANCESTRAL LAND?Invading pastoralists often claim the ranches occupy their ancestral land, where they have always grazed and watered their cattle.John Letai, a regional pastoralist advisor for Oxfam GB, says &ldquo;secret&rdquo; land deals in Laikipia may have contributed to the feeling of being locked out of &ldquo;ancestral&rdquo; land.He notes previously open ranches have changed hands several times, followed by fencing for alternative land use, mostly tourism.&ldquo;Land deals are coming to compound an already existing multiplicity of problems related to access use and management of scarce resources in Laikipia district,&rdquo; he says in his 2011 study.The study is titled &lsquo;The Genesis of Land Deals in Kenya and its Implication on Pastoral Livelihoods &ndash; A Case Study of Laikipia District&rsquo;.Letai notes that over time, many pastoralists have moved from Baringo, Isiolo and Samburu districts to settle in Laikipia in search of water and pasture for their livestock.On the other hand, land pressure in the former Central province is forcing subsistent farmers to move and settle in Laikipia, doing marginal rain-fed agriculture.&ldquo;This has led to competition for space and resources, coupled with increasing frequency of drought and aridity, as witnessed in recent years,&rdquo; he says.The study notes that in 2011, Laikipia had 48 large-scale ranches, representing 40.3 per cent of the total land area.There are 13 group ranches, representing 7.45 per cent of the total land area. These are occupied by pastoralists, who use them for communal grazing, although a few have wildlife conservancies and tourist lodges.A further 122 smallholder farms represent 27.21 per cent of the total land.The government then owns 36 pieces of land &mdash; most of which have been grabbed &mdash; covering 6.58 per cent of the county. These lands are mostly used for training by the military and the National Youth Service.Public forests occupy 7.53 per cent of the land.
