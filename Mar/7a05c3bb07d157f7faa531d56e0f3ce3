A sensational double from red-hot striker Michael Olunga earned Kenya&rsquo;s Haraambee Stars&rsquo; a memorable 2-1 international friendly victory over DR Congo to end the country&rsquo;s five-match win-less streak against the Leopards on home soilThe feat saw the Stanley Okumbi-coached Stars make back-to-back victories over the country, formerly known as Zaire.It took Olunga only six minutes to fire Stars in front but as it was the case when he did the same against Ugandan Cranes three days earlier at the same Kenyatta Stadium in Machakos. However, that lead was not built upon and in the 60th minute, former teenage prodigy Gael Kakuta put DR Congo back into the game with a swerving free kick that left Boniface Oluoch grasping at thin air.Olunga though was to step up on the plate 10 minutes later, sweeping home the ball after good work from Samuel Onyango and substitute Paul Were. The win preserved Stars&rsquo; unbeaten run to 10 matches, the longest the country has enjoyed in its international football history.Regulars&mdash;skipper Victor Wamyama, defender David Owino and goalkeeper Oluoch&mdash;were recalled as Stars&rsquo; sought to keep their fine nine-game unbeaten run, going against a side ranked fifty places above them in the world football pecking order. David Ochieng was pushed into midfield, a position where he made his name while at Tusker.For the umpteenth time, Jesse Were was given a starting berth as coach Stanley Okumbi tried to get him to break his stubborn goal-scoring duck. It is his striking partner who has taken the plaudits over the last three years.Olunga, once again put his name on the score-sheet after latching onto a cross from Johanna Omollo to fire home with his weaker foot.The early goal looked to have rattled the Congolese as they went at the Stars&rsquo; defence looking to find a way back into the tie. Neeskens Kebano&rsquo;s hit the side-netting before Jesse nearly got the monkey off his back with a superb free kick but was denied by Joel Kiassumbua, who was keeping the goal for the visitors.DR Congo were still on the front foot in the second half and when Mandela needlessly tackled Junior Kabananga, Kakuta stepped up to show why he was considered a huge prospect earlier in his career by firing in the equaliser. The game looked to be destined for a familiar end for Stars until Olunga ghosted in to fire the winner after impressive work form Ulinzi&rsquo;s Onyango with a quarter of an hour left to play.
