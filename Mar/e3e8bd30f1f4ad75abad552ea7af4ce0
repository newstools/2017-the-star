Three suspects brandished pistols and ordered them to keep quiet and open the gate.They shot Wanjiku and bundled her body into the car, then forced Njoroge to drive inside and the gate was closed.Threatened, assaulted and robbedThey assaulted Njoroge and threatened to kill him if he raised an alarm.The thugs stole a woofer, home theatre, an unknown amount of money and other electronics.They then drove Njoki and Njoroge to Gitaru.
