Traders in Naivasha have dismissed a new by-law by the Nakuru county government that bans the wrapping of meat in newspapers.The group said the MCAs lacked an agenda and are now passing laws without consulting residents. Traders&rsquo; chairman Peter Njogu said they are surprised that small issues could be discussed and adopted by the county assembly.Njogu said wrapping meat is done in a hygienic manner and nobody has ever complained. &ldquo;We use two nylon bags when wrapping meat,&rdquo; he said. Njogu accused the MCAs of being idle and only focusing on petty issues.Njogu said they are keenly following the latest move, warning that those who passed the motion would be taught a lesson in August. But MCA Virginia Wamaitha said the clause on meat-wrapping was not passed.
