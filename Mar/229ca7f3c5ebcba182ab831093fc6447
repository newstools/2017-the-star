Jubilee aspirants in Nandi and Uasin Gishu counties are tussling over multi-million billboards erected in Eldoret and Kapsabet towns ahead of the party primaries next month.Billionaire businessman Bundotich Kiprop popularly known as Buzeki is among top aspirants who are paying millions of shillings to the county government to use the bill boards.Governor Jackson Mandago and his Deputy along with Kesses parliamentary aspirant Dr Swarrup Mishra are among top aspirants who have erected campaign bill boards in the town center.Some of the huge campaign material on the bill boards have however been pulled down by people suspected to have been hired by rivals.Dr Mishra and Dr Edward Serem who is also vying for governorship have complained bitterly after their bill boards were pulled down.Nandi Central OCPD Stephen Obara says they are also investigating the destruction of Emugwen&rsquo;s aspirant Isaya Gesicho Begi&rsquo;s bill board along the Kapsabet-Eldoret highway.It was torched down by unknown people raising concerns over political tolerance among the aspirants and their supporters."We want a fair campaign and all of us are free to pay and use the billboards. Those hiring goons to destroy the bill boards are political cowards", said Dr Serem.The town is heavily littered in all areas with campaign posters for the jubilee aspirants.The largest billboards attract payments of more than Sh 1 million per month at the county government.Obara warned politicians against incitements and revealed that anyone found culpable will be met with the full force of the law.&ldquo;I urge the public to relay information on such politicians and any other persons whose activities and actions may lead to incitement and intolerance,&rdquo;said Obara.Gesicho is vying on a Jubilee Part ticket and has excited residents posing a threat to rivals interested in the same seat.He will vie against incumbent MP Alex Kosgey and former international athlete Wilfred Bungei. Others in the race include Meshack Kimutai, Kipyego Meli and Martin Kilel.&ldquo;At the end of the day we are all interested in serving our people. We should seek their votes with civility and peace instead of engaging in retrogressive politics&rdquo;, said Gesicho. Gesicho said there was no need for opponents to target the bill boards yet anyone can pay to erect such billboards in areas of their choice.
