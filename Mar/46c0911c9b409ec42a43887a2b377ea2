The banking industry regulator and state-owned deposits insurer yesterday invited investors interested in buying the troubled medium-sized lender Chase Bank to make a formal application.The Central Bank of Kenya and Kenya Deposit Insurance Corporation &ndash; Chase&rsquo;s receiver manager&ndash; have also extended the one-year receivership status at the lender for six months from April 7. The CBK and KDIC said in a joint statement the move to call for expression of interest was within their legal mandates.&ldquo;Chase Bank (Kenya) Limited was a rapidly developing commercial bank, operating through 62 branches,&rdquo; CBK governor Patrick Njoroge said. &ldquo;This announcement commences a formal process of selecting a preferred investor for the bank, which it is hoped may be concluded within the next six months.&rdquo;Njoroge said the successful bidder in the EOI will be &ldquo;granted access to a comprehensive confidential data room to develop a formal (financial and technical) proposal to acquire Chase Bank&rdquo;.&ldquo;The shortlisted investors will be determined in a fair process using appropriate and objective criteria based on, inter alia, regulatory imperatives and prudential guidelines which will ensure a speedy and optimal recovery for depositors, creditors and other stakeholders,&rdquo; Njoroge said.In selecting Chase&rsquo;s suitor, the regulator will be &ldquo;mindful of seeking to preserve and develop a sound and innovative banking system in Kenya&rdquo;.A qualified opinion on Chase Bank&rsquo;s books due to questionable growth in insider loans by external auditors, Deloitte, led to a massive run on the deposits. This was largely fuelled by social media campaign, prompting the CBK governor Patrick Njoroge to place the bank under receivership on April 7. Customers whose cash was locked up in the bank have only been allowed to access up to Sh1 million.This followed re-opening of the bank on April 27, 2016 in a deal KDIC struck with largest lender by market share, KCB, on April 20, 2016 under the guidance of the CBK.The April 7 shock closure of Chase Bank &ndash; which was popular with micro- and small-sized enterprises and investment groups (chamas) &ndash; hit the banking industry hard, leading to &ldquo;flight&rdquo; to large banks from small and mid-sized lenders.About 33 banks reportedly experienced massive panic withdrawals towards the end of last week as depositors transferred their cash to banks they perceive safer, a phenomenon technically referred to as flight to quality.This prompted the Central Bank this week to open a cash window for microfinance and commercial lenders facing pressures to borrow as a last option, after what the CBK governor Patrick Njoroge termed as &ldquo;an aggressive (bank) run&rdquo;.
