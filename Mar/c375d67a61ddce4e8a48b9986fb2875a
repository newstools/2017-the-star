We were winners in Division One but that is last year. We now have a new challenge in front of us this year which we must contain. As a team, our goal is to win, win as much titles as possible and from the level of confidence I have seen during training sessions in the past few weeks, I am optimistic we will do good well,&rdquo; coach Otieno said. Winners of the competition are rewarded with Sh1m in prize money.
