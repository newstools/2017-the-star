Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang ula has urged Kenyans not to be unduly anxious over NASA's presidential flagbearer.Wetang'ula, who was with party deputy leader Boni Khalwale, said all the NASA co-principals are Kenya's better option in terms of salvaging the country from the Jubilee administration's oppression.He said as much as he wants to be the flagbearer, he will support whoever will be selected to carry the coalition's flag.Wetang'ula was speaking in Vihiga county at the home of the late veteran politician Joseph Otiende.He dismissed claims of a dispute in NASA over joint primaries as a creation of the media. Wetang'ula said there is no misunderstanding in the alliance.Khalwale said some leaders in the alliance are blowing the matter out of proportion, yet it is an issue still under discussion by the steering committee.He said it is only the committee he sits in that will make a determination on the way forward regarding nominations. There is no dispute. What is out there is a creation of the media. The committee has not said anything yet, Khalwale said.He said NASA may consider joint nominations in areas where one party enjoys dominance. Wetang ula said Kenyans are anxious, but urged them to remain patient. We don t want to pile pressure on the steering committee, he said.
