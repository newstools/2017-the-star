After seven no-shows, Kandara MP Alice Wahome on Wednesday appeared before a Murang&rsquo;a court a week after a warrant was issued for her arrest.She is charged with interfering with police officers on duty and abusing the power of her office.Wahome denied the charges and denied she had not honoured summones, saying she had not been informed.She called the charges politically motivated.On Thursday last week, the court ordered her arrest after she failed to appear to take a plea.She is charged with obstructing police officers while on duty on June 17 last year at Makenji on Thika-Makuyu old road, Kandara, and abuse of office. The court was told the MP told traffic personnel: &ldquo;You are at my mother&rsquo;s doorstep and I am the MP and a member of the powerful National Assembly Security Committee. &ldquo;Cars should be allowed to ply the road without being subjected to unnecessary checks.&rdquo; The MP told principal magistrate Anthony Mwicigi she presented herself after she learnt of the arrest warrant through the media.&ldquo;County commander of police Naomi Ichami never contacted me to say I was in trouble or even ask why I had not appeared in court,&rdquo; Wahome said.The lawmaker had been ordered to appear before the assistant director of the Public Prosecutions Solomon Njeru who had applied for her arrest.Wahome says the Kandara police station boss told her an arrest warrant had been issued after she demanded to know why he had called her to his office. &ldquo;I was at the High Court in Nairobi when he called, and I am glad the court allowed me to come to Murang&rsquo;a,&rdquo; the MP said. Mwicigi deferred the case to April 12 when the MP will take a plea.
