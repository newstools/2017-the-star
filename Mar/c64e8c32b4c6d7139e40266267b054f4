President Uhuru Kenyatta on Wednesday last week tabled &lsquo;The State of National Security&rsquo; report in Parliament along with his State of the Nation address.&lsquo;The State of National Security&rsquo; is prepared by the National Security Council, which comprises the President; the Deputy President; the Cabinet Secretaries responsible for defence, foreign affairs, and internal security; the Attorney General; the Chief of the Kenya Defence Forces; the Director General of the National Intelligence Service and the Inspector General of the National Police Service.The President presides at meetings of the NEC.Among other things, the NEC report speaks of politicos who arm bandits and other gangs in the volatile North Rift and elsewhere.The NEC is comprehensively well informed and a major consumer of intelligence.It is not enough to merely table the latest NEC report with MPs. It needs to be acted on like the day before yesterday. To begin with, why can&rsquo;t all these people named in the report be disarmed, forcibly if need be?
