An audit will be done on how land leases are renewed, Lands CS Jacob Kaimenyi has said.The six-month exercise is likely to send shock waves among ministry officials who might have been colluding with cartels.Speaking on the sidelines of the National Spatial Plan launch at the KICC yesterday, Kaimenyi said a few individuals could be colluding with cartels to swindle lessees.&ldquo;You have seen people ferrying money in car boots to renew land leases because some people are not honest and they would want to make money,&rdquo; he said.He raised concerns about the rising cases of grabbing after leases expire. Kaimenyi said he will work closely with his Interior counterpart Joseph Nkaissery to ensure culprits are prosecuted.On December 4, last year, Jaameeta Kurji and his family were forcibly evicted from their house in Westlands and the building demolished.The family said it had lived on the quarter-acre land, valued at Sh80 million, since 1972.The lease expired in 2009. Frank Logistics obtained a title deed to the land and a survey plan was issued in 2015.
