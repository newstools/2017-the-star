Paris Marathon winner Visiline Jepkesho hopes to erase her 2016 Rio Olympic disappointments with a win when she returns to the French capital next month.The win earned her a slot in Team Kenya for the Rio Olympics though she failed to impress, finishing 86th in 2:46:05.This was a culmination of another dismal performance finished 20th (2:36.17) during the 2015 IAAF World Championships in Moscow, Russia.Jepkesho, from Nandi County, will be seeking to redeem herself by producing a better performance with her eyes on a slot in the Team Kenya to the 2017 London World Championships.She observed that Paris has been a good hunting ground after being included in Team Kenya twice after posting impressive results at the course.&ldquo;My target is to run better time that will enable me get selected in the marathon team for the World Championships in London,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;Running in Paris will be of great importance since I will be seeking to hit the qualifying time to London. It is my best course and if I qualify for the Worlds, then my prayer will be to get a world championships medal,&rdquo; added Jepkesho, who has personal best time of 2:24:44 clocked while finishing third at the 2015 Paris Marathon.Before then, her focus is on next weeks Nagoya International Women&rsquo;s Marathon in Japan, where she will be a pacemaker for the organisers.&ldquo;I will be pace-setting at the Nagoya International Women&rsquo;s Marathon on March 12 which will also act as my build up for my main race in France,&rdquo; she added.Jepkesho&rsquo;s professional running career begun with a win at the 2013 Darica Half Marathon before making her full marathon debut with a 2:28:40 victory at the 2014 Milan Marathon and following it up with a win at the Lisbon Marathon later that year.
