Insults will not drive him from the Bondo parliamentary race, nominated MP Oburu Oginga has told his rivals.He was responding to Gideon Ochanda and Rarieda MP Nicholas Gumbo.Last week Ochanda asked Oburu to retire, saying he did nothing for the 20 years he was Bondo MP. He accused Oburu of meddling in ODM affairs, remarks echoed by Gumbo in Siaya on Saturday.But Oburu said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m aware that my opponents are out to taint my image with all sorts of malice and outrageous remarks, but that will not [derail] my focus.&rdquo;He was speaking at Daraja Centre in Bondo on Tuesday,Oburu said he has defeated Ochanda three times before and he will do it again this year, especially now that he has resorted to hurling insults at him instead of selling his policies.He asked why Ochanda had to travel to Siaya town with Gumbo to hurl insults at him when he is seeking a reelection in Bondo.Oburu was accompanied by former Gem MP Joe Donde and director of Matangwe Hospital Steve Scott. He said he has enough political experience to defeat Ochanda.Oburu said he bankrolled Ochanda&rsquo;s campaign in 2013 and helped him win the seat because he thought the MP would deliver services to residents, but the people got a raw deal. &ldquo;All the major projects that I had lobbied for in 2007 are stalled and that&rsquo;s why I am back in the race to complete my projects,&rdquo; he said. Oburu said if defeated he will accept the people&rsquo;s verdict as he is not part of any rigging scheme as alleged by his opponents. Last week, Governor Cornel Rasanga urged Oburu and Ochanda not to engage in political battles as they will destabilise ODM leader Raila Odinga&rsquo;s presidential bid.
