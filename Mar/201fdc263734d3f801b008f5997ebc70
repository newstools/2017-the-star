There is no conflict between the national and county governments in the implementation of infrastructural development. Transport PS Aidah Munano has said the two levels of government play a complementary role in road construction. She spoke on Tuesday on an inspection tour of the Konza-Kangundo road in Machakos county. The Sh4.3 million road is constructed by the national government. The county government of Machakos last week advertised in the media that it was supervising construction of the road. But Munano said signposts indicating the contractor and funder should be prominently displayed on the road to allay any doubts about who is behind the project. She expressed satisfaction with the progress. The road will have two bridges and a bus terminus at Koma. Munano said it is 36 per cent done and will be completed in February next year.
