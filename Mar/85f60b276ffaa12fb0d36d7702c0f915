Kajiado county and Kenchic have signed a deal to provide women and youths with financial support to start poultry farming.Kenchic MD James Oduor said the partnership will create jobs. He said they have put up three demonstration units in the county for training youths and women s groups. We want to establish best operating practices in the training units that will be of use, not only to women but the community at large, Oduor said. This will promote good husbandry, because it s the only way to benefit from the entire venture. Governor David Nkedianye (pictured) yesterday praised the deal and said it will benefit residents in many ways, especially in chicken rearing.The project will be done in Kajiado Central, East and North subcounties, starting with 3,000 day-old chicks. The number will be increased. Each subcounty is expected to have at least 10 ventures. We want to increase the uptake of eggs and chicken products and increase consumption of poultry in this county, Nkedianye said. The potential is very huge and the partnership will help us create jobs for the youth and women. We want to make sure we increase the uptake of protein across the county and have a chicken revolution. Kenchic has invested heavily in the county over the past years. It has a corporate social responsibility programme through which it gives back to the communities. The partnership is part of it.
