Club Licensing Board declined to issue Sofapaka FC with either a temporal or full license because they failed to meet the threshold of the financial requirements.These was part of the CLB findings submitted by the board&rsquo;s chairman, Professor Edwin Wamukoya, during witness interrogation at the Sports Disputes Tribunal. Sofapaka FC had sued Football Kenya Federation for relegating them despite meriting to play in the 2017 Kenya Premier League given their performance last season.During the witness questioning, it came out clearly that the club licensing manual doesn&rsquo;t state that a team which fails to meet any of the criteria stand to be relegated. However, it i ndicates that relegation is applicable to the clubs who fail to present themselves to the CLB.&ldquo;The biggest challenge we encountered in licensing Sofapaka is their financial record. Their financial statement presentation neither met nor surpassed the monetary requirements outlined in both the FKF and CAF club licensing manuals,&rdquo; stated Wamukoya.While looking at Sofapaka FC&rsquo;s documents, the CLB deduced that the club was owned by an individual to a tune of 87 per cent, which exceeds the maximum percentage ownership by a private person. The board was not satisfied with Sofapaka FC submitting a hand-written document to indicate that players were paid the October, November and December salaries.&ldquo;The document contained names of the players against which they wrote &lsquo;received&rsquo; and their signatures. What they were signing to have received, and how much they received is unknown to us, so we did not score that,&rdquo; Wamukoya told the Tribunal. The process of club licensing started on April 1, 2016 with a two-day sensitisation sessions and a second conference was in June, before the FKF CL manual was adopted on October 15, 2016 at the Annual General Meeting.The whole club licensing idea started in 2006 had not made any attempts to abide by the Caf&rsquo;s requirement and waited to rush when the October 31 deadline came knocking.&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t FKF have any responsibility to bring these regulations in a manner not to prejudice their membership,&rdquo; asked John Ohaga, SDT chairman.In respond, Patricia Mitei, FKF&rsquo;s lawyer said: &ldquo;There is nothing special about Sofapaka and Muhoroni from other clubs who met the deadline.&rdquo;Lawyer Mary Bonyo representing Sofapaka FC noted: &ldquo;FKF were aware of the ramifications of this and ought to have had a discussion around the relegation and promotion of clubs. Without any consultation, the federation went on to relegate Sofapaka, a team that fought it out to the last bit to merit the premiership.&rdquo;
