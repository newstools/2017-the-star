National volleyball team setter Jane Wacu has ditched her club Kenya Prisons for Kenya Pipeline.Pipeline lured Wacu with a three year deal that was inked yesterday in a landmark transfer involving two of the country women&rsquo;s volleyball rivals.Wacu was offered an improved pay-package from her role at Prisons, where she was a senior sergeant, and will also benefit from medical a cover and housing allowance.Wacu, an alumna of Tetu High School, will be returning to the club she left a decade ago.Over time, she went on to become one of the best setters in the country, enjoying relative success both locally and internationally. She has played for the national team for a decade, had a two-year stint with Pipeline before joing Prisons in 2007. She recently had a two-year pro-volleyball with French topflight side Charmalieres between 2014 and 2015.She is the current Kenya Volleyball Federation national league best setter.Wacu said the move was basically for a change and that she was returning to where it all begun.&ldquo;I have been at Prisons for over 10 years now and my move is for a change. Staying at one place sees your game stagnate and thus the timely move and I remain indebted to the Prisons team and management at large for the support,&rdquo; said the player.With the arrival of Wacu at Pipeline, coach Japtheth Munala will have a variety of setters to choose from ahead of the 2017 Kenya Volleyball Federation league and next month&rsquo;s African Club Championship including Janet Wanja and the promising duo of Veronica Tanui and Joan Muindi.Her departure from Prisons leaves Joy Luseneka as the only experienced setter since the other, former international Sally Wanjala, decamped to Kenya Commercial Bank during the just ended transfer window.Pipeline captain Triza Atuka welcomed Wacu to the side saying: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good move and a big boost for the team. We are a relatively young team and her arrival will most definitely help us achieve more. We don&rsquo;t have an excuse not to perform well.&rdquo;However, Wacu will have to sit out of the 2017 KVF action since the deal way after the February 28 transfer deadline.&ldquo;Pipeline will pay transfer fee to KVF but the player won&rsquo;t feature for either of the two clubs in the 2017 league since the deal was sealed after the expiry of the transfer deadline,&rdquo; said KVF national sports organising secretary Ismail Chege.&ldquo;I have received registration form of players from Prisons and Wacu is among them but now that she has signed for Pipeline, everything has changed.&rdquo;&ldquo;However, the player can play for her new employers in the forthcoming Africa Club Championship set for April in Kelibia, Tunisia since our league is not inclined with world governing body FIVB,&rdquo; added Chege.
