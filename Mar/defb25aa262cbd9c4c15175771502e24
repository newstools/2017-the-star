KenGen's net profit for six months through December 2016 fell by 18.34 per cent on flat growth in electricity sales revenues, the state-owned power producer announced yesterday.The net earnings dropped to Sh4.63 billion from Sh5.67 billion it posted in the same period a year earlier as a result of an 11.43 per cent drop in total income to Sh17.74 billion.&ldquo;The results for the period was impacted by the decommissioning of Garissa (April 2016), Lamu (May 2016) and Embakasi (November 2016) gas turbine thermal power plants and non-receipt of revenue from commercial drilling services,&rdquo; managing director Albert Mugo said in an unaudited financial statement.The company's income was largely hurt by retiring of three thermal plants.Revenues from sale of electricity were flat, falling by a marginal 0.54 per cent to Sh14.68 billion, while that from sale of geothermal steam declined by 1.59 per cent to Sh2.47 billion on transmission constraints.&ldquo;The previous year the amount also included arrears of Sh1.61 billion following the signing of steam resources and maintenance agreement in September 2015,&rdquo; Mugo said.Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation consequently dropped by 15.24 per cent to Sh12.07 billion. Operating costs during the period operating expenses rose by a marginal 6.03 per cent to Sh4.39 billion compared to Sh4.14 billion the year before. KenGen shares on the Nairobi Securities Exchange gained 7.38 per cent day-on-day yesterday to Sh6.55 a share, recouping a 6.15 per cent loss on Tuesday. KenGen, however, said it expects to reverse the drop in net profit during the six-month period in the second half on improved generation of electricity. &ldquo;The performance of the remaining period to June 30 2017 is expected to improve following the completion of the evaluation line for wellheads and fixing of machine breakdowns which affected some power plants,&rdquo; Mugo said. He said the company will start construction of 158-megawatt Olkaria V geothermal project, largely funded by Japan International Co-operation Agency to the tune of Sh40 billion, by end of the month. This follows the resolution of a bitter dispute over compensation with local community last month. The project is part of the 720MW that KenGen is targeting to generate by 2020 at an estimated cost of Sh206.24 billion ($2.005 billion). This is comprised of 631MW from its geothermal fields in Naivasha at an estimated cost of Sh183.95 billion ($1.83 billion) and 90MW from wind farms in Meru (80MW) and Ngong (10MW) at a cost of Sh17.29 billion ($172 million).KenGen said last year it was planning to tap private capital through joint ventures, in addition to debt from its development lenders.
