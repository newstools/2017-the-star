The National Super Alliance (NASA) is using a calculated move to derail the August polls and reject the outcome in the event of Jubilee victory.Raphael Tuju, head of Jubilee Party secretariat, said on Wednesday that the opposition was "only keen on forcing their way into power".He said the group was doing so by deliberately dragging the electoral agency's work to paint it as unable to prepare for the general election.Tuju castigated NASA for mounting legal hurdles to IEBC's poll plan and also for "allegations designed to weaken public faith in the commission".The JP official said that the opposition's warning that the election may be declared illegal is aimed at destabilising the commission's processes."NASA knows they will not win the support of Kenyans in a fair competition. That is why they now claim there is no time to conduct a fair election," he said.Read: NASA fears hacking of poll database "They are the beneficiary of any electoral crisis. They claim to be the champions of democracy but their actions point to attack against democracy itself," Tuju added.He further demanded that Jubilee Party should also be given information on the technology that the commission intends to use in managing the polls.The JP official said the close relationship between NASA consultant Edwin Ngonga and IEBC ICT director James Muhati is worrying."We demand that Muhati shares the same level of detail with all political parties," Tuju said in a press statement."In the light of the above, we demand an end to unilateral engagement between the opposition and IEBC," he added. "All engagements should be formal and structured through the Political Parties Liaison Committee as provided for in the law," Tuju said.The JP team says that their competitor should be reprimanded for what he termed as 'blatant violation of the Elections Act'.They said this was through violation of laws governing resignation of public servants, party-hopping and the agency's role in party primaries."The opposition has succeeded in blocking the procurement of election management system as well as that of ballot papers," Tuju said.On Wednesday, IEBC told politicians to stop spreading propaganda that it is unprepared for the August polls.Chairperson Wafula Chebukati said parties should focus on campaigns to win votes, adding that they will ensure a free, fair, peaceful and credible election.Read: Chebukati dismisses 'scared' politicians spreading election liesAlso read: We are within timelines, IEBC assures Kenyans
