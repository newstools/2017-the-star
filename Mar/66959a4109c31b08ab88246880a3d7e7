Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago raised a record Sh28 million in three hours from friends and well-wishers to finance his reelection campaign.Six hundred residents, including businesspeople, athletes and county staff raised the cash at the dinner attended by Mandago and his Elgeyo Marakwet counterpart Alex Tolgos.The dinner was hosted at the Gulab Lochab Hall. A prominent farmer dished out Sh2 million as appreciation for what he termed Mandago&rsquo;s efforts to fight for farmers' rights.Attendees showered Mandago with praise for helping improve the business environment in Eldoret town.&ldquo;Now we have street lights, good roads and security which can enable us do our business for 24 hours daily,&rdquo; businessman Joseph Wainaina said.Mandago urged residents to give him a second term in office saying his administration had performed well despite facing the usual challenges of devolution which affected all counties.&ldquo;I have laid foundation for the growth of Uasin Gishu to the next level. Now we are targeting to ensure that every home has piped water by 2018&rdquo;, said Mandago. He pledged to build more industries, create jobs for youth and support women empowerment projects.Tolgos said he had worked closely with Mandago and that they both deserve re-election so that the two counties can pursue development activities that will benefit residents.The cash raised was a major boot to Mandago who faces a tough challenge to win the Jubilee ticket against four other formidable challengers. Mandago&rsquo;s main rival is millionaire businessman Bundotich Zedekiah Kiprop popularly known as Buzeki.Others in the race include Dr Edward Serem and Felix Butit.Buzeki has been carrying out a well oiled campaign in the region and is expected to give Mandago&rsquo;s tough competition.However latest opinion polls in the counties have given Mandago a lead against Buzeki who enjoys support mainly in urban areas and Ainabkoi constituency.&ldquo;If it is working you don&rsquo;t have to struggle fixing it. Uasin Gishu does not need a new person who will have start learning the job. We just need a second term to complete what we are already doing&rdquo;, said Mandago.The governor like Buzeki is a close of DP William Ruto whose home is located at Sugoi in the county. Ruto has asked Mandago, Buzeki and other aspirants to ensure unity of communities in the largely cosmopolitan county.
