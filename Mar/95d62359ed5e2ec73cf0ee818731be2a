The Council of Governors has given a nod to the re-categorisation of health facilities.Medical board CEO Daniel Yumbya said they are collecting data on the size, physical location of a facility, qualifications of the personnel, services being offered and the traffic flow of inpatients and outpatient It was launched on February 27 and immediately targets 24 counties in three clusters. Facilities in other counties will be reclassified from April.The matter had raised concern among governors.But in a letter to all the counties, the CoG assured members that the reclassification is not intended to transfer any existing county referral hospitals to the national government as earlier feared.&ldquo;It is aimed at assessing the current status of facilities in terms of infrastructure, service and human resource. The exercise is conducted in good faith and is not meant to upgrade or downgrade any facility as this is a policy decision that cannot made by the medical board and NHIF,&rdquo; Council CEO Jacqueline Mogeni said in a March 2 letter.The exercise is being carried out by the Medical Practitioners and Dentists&rsquo; Board and the National Hospital Insurance Fund on behalf of the national and county governments.&ldquo;Members present agreed that it is important the exercise goes on in the counties as it will provide valuable information on the current status of health facilities and help stakeholders identify gaps and areas that need attention for improvement,&rdquo; the letter says.Yumbya said the two months project will be carried out in six clusters. The first three clusters are ongoing and they target Nairobi, Kiambu, Kajiado, Narok, Kilifi, Kwale, Meru, Nyeri, Kirinyaga, Murang&rsquo;a, Machakos, Mombasa , Kitui, Taita Taveta, Embu, Tharaka Nithi, Isiolo, Garissa, Marsabit, Wajir, Mandera and Makueni.&ldquo;The teams on the ground which are being coordinated by the respective county public health officers have no mandate to downgrade or upgrade any institution as that shall be done jointly by the board chairman, member of the county executive committee of Health in each county and the CEO NHIF upon consideration of the data that is being collected,&rdquo; he said.The current classification of facilities is from Level 1 to Level 5. There are also referral hospitals such as the Kenyatta National Hospital.
