The luxurious yacht blown up for allegedly being used in trafficking heroin belonged to a Kenyan. The boat, Baby Iris, was bought from Kilifi Boatyard Creek by Bilal Ndechunia in 2014. The ownership of the yacht had been declared a mystery.In 2015, assistant director of public prosecution Alexander Muteti said he had not received any letter from anyone claiming its ownership, and the state could no longer pay for its storage. The luxury yacht containing Sh8 million heroin was seized in April 2015 but was later destroyed. Five people including the vessel&rsquo;s pilot, Clement Serge of Seychelles (a British tycoon) and four Kenyans - Ahmed Said Bakar, Mohamed Bakari Mohamed, Sharifu Mzee Mohamed and Ahmed Hussein Salim &ndash; were charged with trafficking drugs in April 2015.
