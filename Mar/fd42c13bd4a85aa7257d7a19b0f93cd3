The Political Party&rsquo;s Disputes Tribunal has issued temporary orders stopping Ababu Namwamba from acting as a member of the Labour Party of Kenya.Tribunal members Kyalo Mbobu and Milly Odongo issued the order after an application by the party claimed Ababu continues to mislead the general public that he is its member.The party told the court Ababu has on several occasions, through his agents, electronic and published media, misrepresented and held himself as a member of the party.&ldquo;We are apprehensive that Ababu will enter into political alignments and agreements under the presence and misrepresentation that he is a member and official of the party.&rdquo;Lawyer Muga Apondi told the tribunal the orders sought are meant to preserve the party&rsquo;s political right and existence.The matter will be heard on March 9.At the same time, David Makali filed an application seeking to bar the party from holding a meeting that was scheduled for Monday.He told the tribunal his political rights and those of the party stand to be prejudiced as there is a risk of strangers being invited and attending a national council meeting to discuss and pass resolutions that may have a long-term implication on the party and its members.Makali saidLPK, Peter ole Musei and Dr Julia Ojiambo continue to act in a manner that infringes on his rights.He said the purported notice of the intended meeting has been issued by a stranger, who is not the authorised official of the party, hence not competent to communicate on behalf of the party or to convene a meeting.The matter will be heard on March 9.
