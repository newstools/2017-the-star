The National Cohesion and Integration Commission should have power to investigate and arrest hatemongers, Kisumu West MP Olago Aluoch has said.He urged the commission to lobby Parliament to give them the powers.&ldquo;The commission has been unable to effectively handle the cases that have come up because it lacks the capacity to ensure that the suspects are brought to book,&rdquo; Olago said.He was speaking in Kisumu on Friday.The NCIC was formed through an Act of Parliament after the 2007-08 post-election violence to fight hate speech and foster cohesion. But Olago said the commission is a toothless dog. He said quite often the prosecution has a strong case but the evidence presented in court is weak because the NCIC relies on other agencies for information, which is insufficient.The MP called for peaceful campaigns, and urged voters to shun violent politicians.
