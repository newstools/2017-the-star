Meru woman representative Florence Kajuju has said JP will remain strong despite a court decision stopping enforcement of a ban on party hopping after nominations.A court last week suspended the Election Laws clause barring party hopping four months before elections until a case filed by governors is concluded.Kajuju said on Wednesday the party will not lose hopefuls to other parties. She spoke when she presided over civic education in Jambo Park, Central Imenti.Kajuju said even after 12 parties merged to form JP, several others were still available and some aspirants have sought their tickets already.&ldquo;The court injunction is not a blow to anyone. When JP was formed, there were 12 parties,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Other parties exist and if this law is stopped from activation, they are the same parties aspirants will move to. This will not affect the JP family.&rdquo;Kajuju said Jubilee supporters believe in its ideology, its manifesto and have confidence in President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto.She dismissed Meru Senator Kiraitu Murungi&rsquo;s comments that the collapse and merger of small parties was a mistake.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether or not he said so. But because he was the driver who led to the formation of the Jubilee Party, I doubt it was a fair comment,&rdquo; Kajuju said.She was joined by Irene Makena, a nominated MCA from Mwangathia. She said many people do not understand what woman representative does so civic education is necessary.&ldquo;We&rsquo;re educating our people on how the seat of the woman representative can help their understanding of roles of political seats,&rdquo; the legislator said. &ldquo;Many of our people lack the knowledge. I found it wise to educate them to know what we have done and what we can do for them.&rdquo;
