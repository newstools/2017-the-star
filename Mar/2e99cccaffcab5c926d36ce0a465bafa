City Hall has defended its Sh35.9 billion 2017-18 budget, terming it people-friendly and people-focussed.But many people say otherwise.About Sh24.1 billion will be used on recurrent expenditure and Sh11.7 billion on development.On Monday the public criticised the financial projections, saying some allocations are not in their best interest.&ldquo;We are seeing too much money allocated to the purchase of vehicles and fuelling. How will this help us?&rdquo; resident Kennedy Kimori said during a public participation forum.Sh100 million for fuel and Sh140 million to buy new vehicles was allocated to Governor Evans Kidero&rsquo;s office, which includes the subcounty administration, the Inspectorate, fire and disaster management and legal affairs.Speaking to the Star at City Hall yesterday, Finance executive Gregory Mwakanongo defended the allocations.&ldquo;The vehicles we are buying are for subcounty administrators and Inspectorate officers. The administrators must be able to move to ensure people pay revenue and there is order in the city,&rdquo; he said.Mwakanongo said the budget considered the interests of the business community and property owners.No taxes or levies will be increased to finance the budget.He said the county has restructured its six revenue streams &mdash; parking, rates, advertising, single business permits, environment and building approvals &mdash; to minimise revenue losses.&ldquo;We will revalue property once the county passes the Ratings and Valuations Bill,&rdquo; Mwakanongo said. The county has been using the valuation roll developed in 1982 which valued an acre of undeveloped land at Sh100,000. Owners epay 25 per cent of the 100,000 as rates. Mwakanongo said the budget will ensure all infrastructure projects that have stalled since 2013 are completed.
