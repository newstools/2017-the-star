A hundred plus stand between Collins Obuya and Rakep Patel and superb bowling performance inspired Kenya to a 38-run victory over hosts Baroda Cricket Association Select to end their India tour on a winning note.Obuya and Rakep clubbed aggressive half centuries as Kenya posted 234 runs all out before Elijah Otieno and Nelson Odhiambo picked three wickets each to choke the hosts to 196 all out with 6.4 overs to play. Obuya top-scored with 79 off 98 balls that included two sixes and eight boundaries. Skipper Rakep was also instrumental with the bat, scoring 96 ball 76, which comprised six boundaries and two sixes.The two put on a fourth wicket stand of 141 runs in 28 overs which lifted Kenya to 187 after they had been put on 46 for 3 after 9.2 overs with the dismissal of Irfan Karim (0), Alex Obanda (22) and Dhiren Gondaria (0). After seeing Kenya past the 50-run mark seven balls after their reunion, the two went on to get Kenya to 100 with the last ball of the 22nd over. They went on to get to 150 after 30.6 overs with Obuya already having reached his half century mark. Obuya&rsquo;s half century came off 59 balls and included two sixes and six boundaries. Rakep took time to get to his first half century of the tour after facing 68 balls. Before reaching the half ton, the Kanbis all-rounder had hit two sixes and two boundaries. The stand, which lasted over an hour and a half, was broken when Swapnil Singh uprooted Obuya&rsquo;s stumps. Rakep and Karan Kaul added 32 for the fifth before Soaib Taib dismissed the captain in a similar fashion to Obuya. From here on, Kenya lost wickets regularly with only a 19 runs stand for the ninth wicket the best. Kenya were all out with four balls to spare.In reply, the home team struggled to build up stands and kept on losing wickets regulary, thanks to some tight bowling from opener Otieno, who claimed 3 for 26 and 3 for 31 respectively. The two had sent both openers back to the pavilion inside 6.1 overs for ducks with the board on 24. Otieno picked two more wickets in the 10th and 12th over to put the hosts on 42 for 4. Dixit Patel, who was standing on one side as wickets scrambled, was finally dismissed on 30 in the 15th over by Shem Ngoche.After 28 overs, the home team was on 77 for 6 but their hopes of salvaging a win got a lifeline in a seventh wicket stand that got the scores to 113 before Oluoch dismissed Taib (40). Atit Sheth looked set to see his home side with 65 until he fell at last to Odhiambo.
