University of Nairobi women&rsquo;s volleyball team survived a scare from Multimedia University in their Nairobi South Conference of the ongoing Kenya Universities Sports Association over the weekend at Africa Nazarene.Both sides committed unforced errors and whereas UoN Vixens had a lot at stake, national women under-23 head coach Catherine Mabwi&rsquo;s Multimedia line-up garnered a point in the five-setter game.Tutored by Gideon Njine and Seth Anyanda, Vixens bagged the first set 25-19 and in a give-and-take second round, UoN lost 22-25. The third set was anyone&rsquo;s set to win but with setter Vane Kerubo&rsquo;s few and far between dodges, Njine&rsquo;s charges gathered a 25-18 win.UoN let loose the fourth session for a determined Multimedia to win 17-25, forcing the game to a tie-breaker. Mabwi&rsquo;s team seemed to be exhausted in the rally set, slipping 15-7, for UoN to run away with the game.Multimedia University collected six more points after they hammered Machakos University 3-0 (25-18, 25-16, 25-13) and Catholic University of East Africa 3-0 (25-9, 25-8, 25-12). Machakos University got another 3-0 (25-8, 26-24, 25-14) beating from the Vixens before grabbing three points after defeating Co-operative University 3-1 (25-20, 25-17, 19-25, 25-21). Strathmore University continued their winning ways, whitewashing CUEA (25-6, 25-9, 25-8) and Machakos University (25-10, 25-8, 25-23) respectively.
