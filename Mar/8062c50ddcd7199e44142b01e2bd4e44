Rarieda MP Nicholas Gumbo is neither a rebel nor disloyal to ODM party leader Raila Odinga, the branch Executive Committee has said. Branch chairperson Onyango Omollo dismissed the ‘rebel’ claims made by Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga, his deputy Ouma Onyango and nominated MP Oburu Oginga. Gumbo wants to replace Rasanga. On Thursday, Omollo said Gumbo has been funding ODM activities using his own money since 2005. He addressed the press at the party office. Omollo said Gumbo has paid the office rent since its establishment. He said Gumbo campaigned for Rasanga and Onyango are elected in 2013. Branch secretary William Odongo said Gumbo has developed his constituency. He criticised Oburu for insisting Rasanga be reelected. Gumbo has said he is unfazed by critics and will not drop his bid for the Siaya top seat. Other aspirants include former regional development PS Carey Orege and businessman William Oduol. Last week, a group of Alego-Usonga residents said they will support Rasanga. They crowned him an elder so he can preside over cultural decisions in the constituency. In a statement read by Dismus Wakila in Boro Primary School, the residents said they will remain united and champion Rasanga’s reelection. They said he is their sole candidate for governor. Oburu, former Gem MP Joe Donde and former Alego-Usonga MP Sammy Weya were present.
