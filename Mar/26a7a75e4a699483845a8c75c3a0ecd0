An activist has asked the High Court to commit to civil jail IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati and his commissioners for disobeying an order.Also sought is an order to suspend the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission&rsquo;s decision to halt continuous voter registration from March 7 to September 5 as announced in a gazette notice.In effect, this means if the order sought is granted, then the voter registration drive will resume again until June 10.Activist Okiya Omtatah says the IEBC and its bosses, contrary to an undertaking they gave in court on February 16, have stopped the voter registration.According to the undertaking, it was agreed that the voter registration will continue until June 10, which is 60 days to the election date.Now Omtatah says the decision by the IEBC to close the voter registration effectively denies close to nine million eligible Kenyans an opportunity to be registered as voters before the August 8 polls.He says the IEBC bosses were fully aware of the decision and orders of the court, since the undertaking was made unconditionally by their lawyer in the matter.And as a result, he says, the commissioners are bound by pleadings before the court.And their action to disregard compliance with the court order will gravely undermine its authority and prejudice all law-abiding members of the public.Omtatah is of the view that in the event the court does not intervene and stop this blatant disregard of orders, there is a high likelihood of continued violation of law. &ldquo;I verily believe that it is now incumbent for this honourable court to grant the orders sought in this application to enforce the rule of law,&rdquo; he says.The undertaking in question was given in a case filed by Omtatah on February 13, seeking to stop the closure of the voter registration.At the initial stage of hearing, the court granted a temporary order, stopping the IEBC from closing the voter registration exercise and directed that matter be heard in the presence of all parties. Omtatah had argued that at the constituency level, sometimes the registration centres are far from the voters and this has had an effect of non-registration of citizens.He proposed the registration at the ward level should continue and only close 60 days to the election as provided for in Section 5 of the Election Act. Anything else, he had said, would amount to denial of citizen rights. The IEBC opposed his case, saying there is no evidence that anyone has suffered prejudice.
