Murang'a leaders have complained that some residents are being forced to give their ID and mobile phone numbers before receiving relief food from the government.Led by Kigumo MP Jamleck Kamau, the leaders said coercing residents to give out such details as a prerequisite to receive relief food is wrong.Kamau urged residents who have been coerced to give out confidential details to report to the police, as the information might be used in bad motives including transfer of voters out of Murang&rsquo;a."If you want to assist people why do you have to ask for their mobile numbers and other details? Our people are intelligent and will make an informed decision come August,&rdquo; he said.The legislator urged the police to investigate the matter and bring the culprits to book.The prolonged drought ravaging Kenya has affected the lower parts of Murang'a county, leaving hundreds of families relying on relief food. Kamau said the county government has not provided water to the residents."It is a shame that we take water several kilometres away to Nairobi before quenching our people who are in dire need of this precious commodity. If elected, I will ensure there is enough water for domestic use and irrigation to increase our produce from our land that is fertile enough to support the whole of Murang&rsquo;a and our neighbours," he said.Kamau wants to run for governor.He said that Kambiti and surrounding areas have been left out in terms of development and promised to set up an Equalisation Fund that will hasten development in these areas.Kamau spoke during a meet-the-people tour of Kambirwa, Marewa, Gikuu, Mirira, Kambiti, Kiambamba, Kahuho, Mihang'o and Ciumbu.He said he will start a process to recover any stolen public funds from Muranga county if elected Governor.Kamau said all leaders must be held accountable for actions of omission or commission during their tenure in office.He also urged residents to ignore politicians who incite them against one another.The MP urged the to vote in primaries and in the general election.
