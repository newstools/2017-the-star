Road users want to sue the government today over the "torturous" traffic congestion in Mlolongo caused by long queues of trucks at the weighbridge, which makes motorists spend one hour to drive through the 1km stretch. Some of my clients have spent over 40 minutes to one hour daily stuck in traffic that stretches over 1km long because of congestion of trucks, lawyer Edward Oonge said.He represents the road users staying on the sides of Sabaki, Kitengela, Athi River and Daystar.On Saturday, Oonge said he had written to the Kenya National Highways Authority and Infrastructure CS James Macharia on March 10 to complain about the traffic congestion.He told journalists that he assumes that during the designing and implementation of the weighbridge in Mlolongo, great care and studies were undertaken on the impact on the smooth flow of traffic. Unfortunately, it now appears that the project was designed by professionals who never understood the effect of such project, Oonge said in a letter to KenHa.While the weighbridge is necessary and important in other aspects and has cost taxpayers a lot of money, residents should not be inconvenienced by it.The lawyer gave notice of intent to sue today if there shall be no compliance in the issues he raised in his letter of complaint.Joseph Kimani, who commutes to Nairobi every weekday, told journalists he is forced to wake up at 4am to beat the traffic jam in Mlolongo that sometimes extend up to the Kitengela/Namanga/Mombasa interchange. In the evening, the earliest time I arrive home is 8pm because of the incessant jam at Mlolongo, he said.Students in Kitengela, Athi River and Daystar, who go to colleges in Nairobi, wake up as early as 4am to arrive in the city by 7.30am.The distance from Kitengela to Nairobi is only 30km but it takes commuters two to three hours to cover because of the trucks that jam Mlolongo.
