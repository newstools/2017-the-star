Undaunted by the searing Muthaiga heat, Dismas Indiza savoured joining the money bracket yesterday after shooting a remarkable round of 5 under par 66.The long hitting Mumias professional wrapped up the first two rounds on an impressive total of 4 under par 138 to make the cut.He sunk in six brides on holes 2,3,4 10, 17 and 18 and parred 11 holes. Indiza teed off from the first tee in the company of Lampert Mortiz of Germany and Virto Borja of Spain shot 33 in the first nine and a similar score in the back nine.In an interview, the soft spoken pro said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite a good feeling to make the cut again. I just wish the fans can keep away from me tomorrow (today) as they usually pile pressure on me whenever they trail me on the course. I played well today (yesterday) but missed lots of putts. My hitting was awesome but my shot game needs a little bit of polishing. I was a bit nervous on the first day which made me drop some vital shots. Golf is a bit unpredictable but the essence on my side will be to hit the fairways and avoid the bankers and roughs,&rdquo; said Indiza.Also making the cut with a total of 2 under par 140 was Windsor&rsquo;s Riz Charania and Thika Sports Club resident professional Simon Ngige, who was the leading Kenyans on Thursday. Ngige played a round of 4 under par 67 in round one and went on to play 2 over par 73 which wasn&rsquo;t that bad, considering his performance the first day. Ngige was among the three Kenyans, who made the cut last year together with Indiza and Mathew Omondi of Vet Lab, who was disqualified on Thursday for signing a wrong score. Charania, who is the resident professional at Windsor, repeated a score of 1 under 70 for a total of 2 under par 140. Charania shot two birdies on the eighth and 18th and an albatross on the par five hole 10.
