Russia and China have vetoed a UN resolution to impose sanctions on Syria over the alleged use of chemical weapons.It is the seventh time Russia has vetoed a UN Security Council resolution to protect the Syrian government.China has also vetoed six Security Council resolutions on Syria since the civil war began in 2011.Syria agreed to destroy its chemical weapons in 2013 under an agreement negotiated between Russia and the US.The Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad is accused of carrying out chemical attacks on its own civilians - a charge it denies.However, investigations by the UN and international chemical weapons watchdog have found that Syrian government forces carried out three chemical weapons attacks in 2014 and 2015.The reports said that Syrian air force helicopters had dropped chlorine gas on rebel-held areas, twice in March 2015 and once in April 2014.The use of chlorine as a weapon is prohibited under the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention.Islamic State (IS) militants had also used sulphur-mustard gas in an attack, the watchdog found.Tuesday's resolution had been drafted by the US, the UK and France.It would have banned the sale of helicopters to Syria and would have led to sanctions against 11 Syrian commanders or officials, and 10 groups linked to the chemical attacks.Nine Security Council members supported the resolution, while three - China, Russia and Bolivia - voted against it.The final three members - Egypt, Kazakhstan and Ethiopia - abstained.
