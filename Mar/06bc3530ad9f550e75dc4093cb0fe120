Safran Identity has been appointed by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission to supply the elections equipment for the August 8 polls.The France-based firm, formally known as Morpho, was one of the vendors who supplied BVR kits for the 2013 general elections and the sole supplier of the kits in the January 16-February 19 mass voter registration.IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati yesterday said the company has pledged to deliver the Kenya Integrated Management System for transmission of election results within the statutory timelines.Chebukati said the commission's decision to settle on the firm was broadly based on the need to comply with legal timelines in relation to the deployment of ICTs ahead of the general election."Adequate time is required for configuration, testing, training and deployment for purposes of voter verification exercise by May 10," he said.The other reason was for continuity as the commission already has a maintenance contract for BVRs for the next three years with the firm, Chebukati added.The IEBC chairman said the company is already supporting the electoral agency in the voter register preparation, having already provided the system that was used in the registration.The commission is also trying to avoid mistakes witnessed in the March 4, 2013 election, Chebukati said."We are confident that using Safran at this point, there is guarantee for compatibility, timely delivery and accountability in the deployment of the new system," he said.The systems used in the 2013 elections were provided by multiple vendors, leading to serious implications on election day when they collapsed.Chebukati said it was hard for the integration of new systems with the existing ones once the systems collapsed on election day as there is limited time.He said that with Safran, such hitches will easily be avoided as the firm has sufficient project management capacity and there won't be problems for integration as the systems are fully compatible."Any other way will jeopardise preparations for the elections," Chebukati said.The IEBC recently terminated a tender awarded to French firm Gemalto SA, citing stringent electoral timelines.It said the remaining tendering processes of the procurement, the manufacture, delivery, installation and commissioning of the system would leave very limited time for the commission to meet its operational and legal timelines.The commission also said Gemalto had quoted a higher price of Sh5.2 billion against the available budget of Sh3.8 billion.
