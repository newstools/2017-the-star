A dubious precedent was almost set this past week when Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko was turned away by the party when he sought the Jubilee ticket to run for city governor. The JP officials acted on the grounds that Sonko lacked a certificate of good conduct from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations. On Thursday night, Sonko obtained his certificate from the DCI and produced his secondary school certificate.Earlier JP turned away reputed former Mungiki leader Maina Njenga, who wanted the ticket to run for Senator, saying he lacks a certificate of good conduct from the DCI. Maina went straight to court and the case is ongoing. Sonko was elected Senator by more than 800,000 Nairobians. Only Presidential candidates Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila Odinga got more votes - nationwide. Uhuru and William Ruto were cleared to run by the courts despite the crimes against humanity charges against them at the ICC. The courts argued that evidence of guilt is only adduced through due process. This high standard should apply to all.
