Deputy President William Ruto's shoot-to-kill order will not help end violence in the Kerio Valley, but dialogue will, West Pokot leaders yesterday said.They said conflicts are solved through dialogue, not disarmament. Many innocent people have lost their lives since it s hard for the police officers to identify the criminals. The communities know the culprits and if dialogue is embraced the culprits who are distorting peace will be known, Senator John Lonyangapuo said.Lonyangapuo, Sigor MP Philip Rotino and chairman of the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority Samuel Poghisio were speaking during a public baraza at Lomut centre.He urged the government to facilitate elders to hold meetings to identify the culprits. Pokots are peace-loving people. The few criminals in the community should not make Kenyans think that the community doesn t love their neighbours, Lonyangapuo said.He urged the government to set up social amenities. The conflicts we are experiencing are because the area was marginalised by past regimes. The current government should allocate more resources to the region, Lonyangapuo said. Rotino urged leaders to help find a lasting solution to the region's problems. As elected leaders from this region let s put our political party differences aside and help our people in Baringo. They are our neighbours and the conflict should be stopped immediately before it spreads to neighbouring counties, he said. Rotino also urged leaders to hold peaceful campaigns to avoid triggering violence in other communities. As politicians let s sell our ideologies well without inciting each other, he said. Poghiso said dialogue has helped unite many communities in the North Rift. He said it s high time the government called off the ongoing security operation.The state has deployed 255 police reservists in Kerio Valley to complement efforts of 400 officers drawn from regular, anti-stock theft and general service (GSU) units.
