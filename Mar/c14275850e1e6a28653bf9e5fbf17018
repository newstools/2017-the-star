A soldier stabbed his former partner 11 times and dumped her body in a cupboard before trying to hang himself at a nearby beauty spot, a court heard on March 27. Jay Nava allegedly stabbed on-off girlfriend Natasha Wake with an eight inch knife after the pair argued at her home in Bournemouth, Dorset, while three children were sleeping upstairs on September 2 last year.Winchester Crown Court heard the argument erupted after she discovered he was investigated by police for an alleged sexual assault on another woman. One of the children then came downstairs and saw blood on him and the walls - only to be told by Nava it was "ketchup" and to go back upstairs. The court heard that Nava, 27, who was on leave from the army, allegedly struck the 26-year-old mother of two before stabbing her repeatedly following the argument.Such was the force of his attack, "six of the stab wounds went completely through her trunk and out of her back".Minutes later a young child came downstairs and saw him with blood on him and a knife in his trousers, as well as a dead Wake slumped on the floor with a blanket over her.The youngster told police she saw "red on the walls" - later identified as blood - and that Nava had told her it was "ketchup" before saying: "Go upstairs and don't come back down".The following day Nava took the children to his grandparents home before he contacted his mother and confessed to killing Wake and also told her he was going to kill himself.As police searched beauty spot Hengistbury Head on a clifftop in Bournemouth, Dorset, Nava was spotted by an officer, made eye-contact with him and then tried to hang himself.The officer was able to intervene and after he was resuscitated his first words were: "I want to die".Nava, of the Royal Artillery&rsquo;s 29 Commando Regiment in Plymouth, denies murdering Wake at her home in Bournemouth.The court heard Nava, who joined the army in January 2015, first began his relationship with Ms Wake, who worked at Nationwide bank, in January 2013.Nava left three notes at her home saying "why he stabbed her was beyond him", apologising to her mother and saying he planned to kill himself.Opening the trial, prosecutor Miss Sally Howes QC described the moment officers discovered Wake's body slumped in a cupboard at her home.Howes QC said: "Upon entering the living room, police inspector Matthew Chutter noticed an understair cupboard."When he opened it, his attention was drawn immediately to a mass of platinum coloured hair which was nestled on top of a white, blood stained duvet."Disturbing the duvet revealed a female face. Dried blood had matted around the nose and mouth and in her hair. The body was curled up into the foetal position."Her body was rigid, her eyes were open and fixed. She was not breathing, she had no pulse, she was very cold to the touch and completely unresponsive."Read more on Daily Mail
