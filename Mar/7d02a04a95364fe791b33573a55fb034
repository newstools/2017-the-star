Nyeri assembly speaker Mwangi Mugo has denied reports that the assembly has delayed passing a supplementary budget. He has written a letter to President Uhuru Kenyatta. The letter dated March 7 says there is no standoff as claimed by Governor Samuel Wamathai and the claims are misleading. It reads, &ldquo;The outburst by the governor was uncalled-for. It is quite clear it was a well-calculated political gimmick to portray assembly members before the whole nation as uncaring.&rdquo;
