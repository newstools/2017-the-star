Elgeyo Marakwet county will sack the 51 striking doctors who will not have resumed their duties before Monday next week and advertise their positions, Health executive Thomas Ruto has said.Doctors have been on strike for 97 days since December 5, 2016, demanding the implementation of their CBA that would see them get a 300 per cent pay rise.They have been in talks with the national and county governments over their demands and some sections of their demands have been agreed on.Nurses have also threatened to boycott work from Monday if their CBA is not signed and implemented.Ruto said the county will adhere to a directive issued by President Uhuru Kenyatta on Tuesday ordering county governments to axe doctors who do not go back to work. There is nothing much we can do other than to subject them to disciplinary action, which includes sacking. People must be ready to work, he said.Kenyatta National Hospital has fired 12 doctors and written show cause letters to 48 others.On Tuesday, Elgeyo Marakwet nurses said they will join other nurses in a nationwide strike if a collective bargaining agreement that led to a go-slow in December last year will not be have been signed and implemented by the midnight of Sunday.Kenya National Union of Nurses county secretary general Benson Biwott said the government has reneged on the December return-to-work.He said nurses want a 50 per cent hike in pay and risk allowances.Among the demands is a Sh50,000 per year uniform allowance. Nurses receive the least amount of Sh7,000 as uniform allowance yet they are the only cadre of health workers who must be in uniform, Biwott said.He said the state paid the nursing service allowance in January and later took nurses in circles on the remaining demands. Expect no nurse in hospitals by the midnight of March 12 if the Treasury and county governments will not have signed the CBA, Biwott said.
