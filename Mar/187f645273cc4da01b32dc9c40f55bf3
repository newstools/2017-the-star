A standard six pupil was charged in Kiambu yesterday with stealing Sh407,700 from his grandfather&rsquo;s bank account. The accused appeared before chief magistrate Patricia Gichohi and was charged jointly with two friends, a standard seven pupil, 15, and Francis Kyalo Kimeu, 23.

He also bought uniforms for Umoja Junior FC, to which he belongs. The three are in police custody.
