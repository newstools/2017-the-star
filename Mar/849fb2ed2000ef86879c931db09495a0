Nilikuwa najaribu kumfafanua yule mwenzangu...sitaki kumtaja jina," Sonko said."Ningependa kusema ya kwamba pengine niliteleza kwa mdomo. Nasema pole."(I regret what I said and ask for forgiveness from people living with albinism for using the word. I was trying to describe him...I don't want to name him. It was a slip of the tongue. I am sorry.)Sonko explained tha anger drove him to use the word; he said Kenneth referred to him as a hooligan."Nilikuwa na hasira mno. Ati anasema mimi nikuwe deputy wake. Nawezaje kuwa deputy wake na yeye alishasema mimi ni hooligan? [Nilisikia hasira na uchungu sana]," he said.(I was very angry. He wants me to his deputy...how can that be when he called me a hooligan? I was very angry and hurt.)Sonko dismissed reports that he accepted to be Kenneth's running mate in the August 8 general election.The Sunday Standard reported that there were plans by the Jubilee fraternity to urge Sonko to agree to this.But he said the report was the "joke of the year" and claimed it was influenced by "malicious" politicians."I wish to urge our supporters in Team Nairobi and Jubilee Party members to ignore such propaganda aimed at confusing voters," he said via Facebook.More on this: Sonko dismisses Peter Kenneth running mate report as 'joke of the year' The Senator further accused host Hussein Mohamed called him an hour before the show and that he did not have time to prepare."Hussein aliniambia 'sina mtu leo', akasema anataka nikuje anihost," he said.(He told me he did not have a guest to interview and asked me to go to the station.)Sonko's apology came a day after KNCHR said Jubilee should discipline him for his utterances.In a statement, the rights body said the Senator swore an oath to abide by the law but negated the spirit of national values and article 10 of the constitution.&ldquo;The contemptible reference to [Kenneth] as an albino goes beyond the basic tenets of decorum, appropriateness, and courtesy by a leader,&rdquo; said KNCHR chair Kagwiria Mbogori.Read: Jubilee should discipline Sonko for calling Kenneth 'albino' - KNCHREarlier in the week, Nominated MP Isaac Mwaura asked the Senator to stop using his popularity to perpetrate abuse and discrimination.Mwaura, who is Albinism Society of Kenya national coordinator, said Sonko disrespected people living with albinism.He asked him to either apologise or prepare to deal with the society which he noted will support people living with albinism.[VIDEO] Apologise for albino remarks against Kenneth or we'll deal with you, Mwaura tells SonkoSonko, who is also a governor aspirant, said his feud with Kenneth was personal.He said it emanated from the 2013 general election where Kenneth did not back President Uhuru Kenyatta.Kenneth at that time contested the presidency through the Kenya National Congress party, emerging fourth.He is being fronted to fight it out with Governor Evans Kidero of ODM under the Jubilee Party ticket.Read: Feud with Peter Kenneth personal, Sonko says, demands apology from JP rival
