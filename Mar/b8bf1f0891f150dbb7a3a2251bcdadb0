Police have arrested 379 illegal grazers in Laikipia and removed herders from 16 ranches, a day after Briton Tristan Voorspuy was killed.This comes after months of undeterred raids on private ranches and conservancies in Laikipia and banditry attacks linked to cattle rustling in Elgeyo Marakwet, Baringo and other pastoralist counties.Voorspuy, a father of two, was a former British soldier, director of Sossion Ranch and also ran Offbeat Safaris. He held dual citizenship of Kenya and Britain.Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery in a press briefing yesterday termed Voorspuy&rsquo;s killing unfortunate and said it was linked to conflicts in the county.Fight for pasture and incitement&ldquo;Whereas scarcity of pasture and water resources often contribute to conflict between certain communities and in some cases encroachment into privately owned land, criminals have taken advantage to engage in cattle rustling, poaching and killing of civilians and even security officers. This has also resulted in displacement of innocent civilians,&rdquo; Nkaissery said.&ldquo;Local political leaders have contributed to the tension by making inflammatory statements and sometimes even blatantly inciting locals to break the law through illegal occupation of private property,&rdquo; he added.Rancher&rsquo;s body retrieved after a dayNkaissery said Voorspuy&rsquo;s body had been recovered and was on its way to the city&rsquo;s morgue. The director of criminal investigations was in Laikipia leading investigations to apprehend those responsible, he said.&ldquo;Security agencies have been directed to immediately arrest those suspected to have incited citizens to commit these atrocities of murder, poaching, cattle rustling and destruction of property,&rdquo; Nkaissery said.Voorspuy was killed on Sunday and his friends had hired two choppers early yesterday to retrieve the body but they were prevented by police due to the volatile security situation. Nkaissery, however, evaded questions on details of politicians the government suspects are behind the raids and the time-frames in when they will be arrested and prosecuted.He denied that police were overwhelmed and dismissed suggestions for military intervention.Nkaissery said more officers and police reservists have been deployed to the area.Officers have removed illegal grazers from private farms and ranches in Laikipia and recovered stolen property, he said. &ldquo;However, some private landowners have declined support from security agencies and prefer to negotiate directly with communities,&rdquo; the CS said.
