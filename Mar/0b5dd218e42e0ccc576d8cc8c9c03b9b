Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero has ordered the removal of billboards interfering with trees. The county boss has also ordered the arrest of those cutting down trees in the city. "All billboards that interfere with trees must be brought down in seven days," Kidero said on Tuesday in a letter to Lands and Environment executives Christopher Khaemba and Peter Kimori. He issued the directive three days after an advertising company reportedly felled trees in Karura forest for its billboards to be more visible. Public outrage followed on Sunday while Karura MCA Kamau Thuo condemned the act and called for immediate action by the county. "[They] destroyed trees and monkeys' habitats with the selfish intention of creating visibility for the billboard without due regard to the environment," he said. "The numerous indigenous trees destroyed have a combined centuries' old life - all destroyed in a day to erect a billboard." Other areas where trees have been cut include King'ara Road, James Gichuru Road and Prof Saitoti Avenue in Westlands. The rampant tree cutting has led to an online campaign to force the county government to stop it.
