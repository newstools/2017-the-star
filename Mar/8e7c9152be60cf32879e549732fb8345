Deputy President William Ruto on Tuesday made an impromptu tour of Rumuruti area in Laikipia County where he commissioned an integrated police reservists programme to tame insecurity in the region.There was no politician attended the closed-door security meeting chaired by Ruto with top security chiefs.Senator Kipchumba Murkomen( Marakwet East), Laikipia Senator GG Kariuki and Laikipia West MP Wachira Karani had accompanied the deputy president but were not allowed to address the security meeting.Ruto visited the area that has in the past few months experienced rising cases of insecurity that have also led to the killing of a rancher last Sunday.The DP who was accompanied by the National Police Service (NPS) Director of Operations Bension Kibue, addressed a closed-door security meeting the Rumuruti Sports club in Laikipia West before commissioning 200 police reservists.&ldquo;The reservists who were issued firearms and uniforms are set to join a joint police officers among them Regular, Administration, RDU, ASTU and GSU officers to conduct an operation to mop up illegal firearms and also drive away illegal grazers who have invaded the area leaving behind a trail of destruction, killings and loss of livestock&rdquo; said Ruto.The DP said the reservists will be remunerated and would be trained to work with the National Police Service.Ruto said the operation in Laikipia would be under one police command, and the commander will be answerable to the highest authorities.&ldquo;A total of 1360 NPR have been deployed to assist other security agencies operating in Laikipia and Baringo Counties to ensure the safety of the residents and also to see to it that all criminals are dealt with accordingly&rdquo; said the DP.He added that two platoons of GSU officers and armoured vehicles would be deployed next week to reinforce the existing officers in Laikipia.Ruto said the challenges of insecurity must be dealt with to ensure Laikipia is safe from criminals and that the officers must ensure that all animals in the region that have migrated from other areas are driven back.The DP at the same took issues with pastoralists who have allowed their children to herd animals instead of allowing them to go to school in the area.He directed the security officers to round up the parents and ensure they face the full force of the law.Ruto observed that it was unfortunate that young child of school going age could abandon school and opt to graze hundreds of animals when their colleagues and friends were in class.
