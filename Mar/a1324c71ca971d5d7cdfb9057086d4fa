Chief Justice David Maraga yesterday narrated how he was once arrested in Nakuru town while still a student allegedly for loitering, and detained for hours.Maraga said criminal sanctions on petty offences that expose poor Kenyans to rampant violations of human rights by enforcement officers are unconstitutional.&ldquo;Idleness, begging, loitering, drunkenness, disorderliness, prostitution, indecent exposure, nuisances among other misdemeanours should not have a place in this progressive legal climate,&rdquo; Maraga said. The CJ said the offences should be made &ldquo;fine only offences&rdquo;.&ldquo;We must ask, of all bodies and institutions that are either part of the criminal justice system or interact with it, the questions that concern all: What really are petty offences? Are these offences serious enough? In the alternative, what would be a legal framework for petty offences?&rdquo; he said. The CJ said the laws open up loopholes for poor people to be mistreated.Maraga spoke yesterday during the national conference on decriminalisation and re-classification of petty offences organised by the International Commission of Jurists at a Nairobi hotel.
