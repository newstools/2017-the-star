Elders, youths and MCAs from Wajir county have said they will back Governor Ahmed Abdullahi, despite three MPs withdrawing their support.The elders from the three main clans, led by former Diif councillor Dakane Siyad and county youth chairman Mohamud Ali, accused the MPs of maligning Abdullahi&rsquo;s name by claiming he has done nothing for residents.MPs Mohamed Elmi (Tarbaj), Adan Keynan (Eldas) and Abass Mohamed (Wajir East) last week accused the incumbent of excluding other county leaders during decisionmaking. They said he does not deserve a second term.They also accused the governor of failing to implement measures to mitigate the effects of drought. Yesterday, the elders and MCAs said they support Abdullahi because &ldquo;he has transfored the county.&rdquo;&ldquo;We elected our governor and MPs at the same time in 2013. It is our job, not that of the MPs, to rate performance. The MPs have an interest in the matter and are not well-placed to judge him,&rdquo; former councillor Dakane Siyad said.He said it is not the sole responsibility of the governor to address drought. Siyad said the MPs have access to contingency cash in the CDF, but have done nothing.Elder Yuri Abdullahi said, &ldquo;The MPs have refused to hire a single water tanker to distribute water to their constituencies.&rdquo;
