Mandera women have been urged to closely monitor their children, amid growing concerns they are being targeted by terror cells.National Commission and Integration Commission vice chairperson Irene Wanyoike said women are better placed to notice changes in their children s behaviour. She was addressing women from across the county during a meeting in Mandera town on advancing the women s role in countering violent extremism.Wanyoike said many mothers have neglected their parental responsibilities, which has caused moral decay of their children.She said the children become soft targets for terror groups' recruiters. It is the mothers who know their children and the family at large. Bringing up a morally upright society should not be left to women alone. The entire society should be involved," Wanyoike said.She said campaigns involving women should not be misconstrued to mean that men should be excluded. If we have to succeed, then men should be brought on board because we need their support, Wanyoike said.She said men and youths in Mandera, which borders war-torn Somalia, remain soft targets for militia groups.Wanyoike urged Mandera residents to uphold peace as the August 8 general election approaches. The county has had a history of inter-clan clashes.Wanyoike said the commission is committed to uniting all communities. Even as politicians criss-cross the county looking for votes, we should not entertain those out to incite communities against each other to advance their selfish interests. Such individuals should be shunned at all cost, she said.The meeting was also attended by religious leaders and security personnel.
