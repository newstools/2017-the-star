Pokot herders in Tiaty subcounty, Baringo, say they have lost more than 5,000 livestock due to the harsh drought.About 3,000 of them were forcefully evicted from Baringo North and South subcounties after the government banned cross-border grazing.The action was taken as part of security operations to send a spate of attacks by armed herders from the community.The herders were in areas including Arabal, Rugus, Mukutani, Chebinyiny, Sirata, Komolion, Orus Ng elecha and Noosukro in Baringo South. Others were in Kagir, Yatya, Chemoe, Natan, Kapngetio and Chepkesin in Baringo North.The nomadic pastoralists are now pondering their next move in Tiaty subccounty areas of Paka, Akwichatis, Churo, Tangulbei, Ameyan, Chesitet, Ripko and Silale."Since I drove back my 150 animals from Arabal in Baringo South, I have lost half of them in a record one week" Dodonyang Sawel told the Star in Ameyan on Saturday.Nabori said dogs were feeding on the carcasses and that he had lost hope of the survival of the other animals following the drought that began last July."I don't know my fate," he said, adding his children needed school fees and that there were others who depended on him.Read: 1,000 livestock die at Baringo IDP camps as banditry victims suffer hungerAlso read: Hunger pushes Baringo residents, livestock closer to the graveHerder Nepeitole Korwawa said he had lost 40 cows and 60 goats since driving his animals from Natan and Kagir in Baringo North subcounty."I sold three cows to buy 200 bales of hay but now it is not enough to feed the 300 left.
