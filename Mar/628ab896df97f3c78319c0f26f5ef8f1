A group of Nyeri MCAs have said they will not attend former and late Governor Nderitu Gachagua&rsquo;s burial in Mathira West constituency on Monday, citing death threats.On Thursday, majority leader Duncan Gituanja said, &ldquo;We have been threatened on social media and since we are not sure that we will be protected by the security agents, we choose to stay away.&rdquo; He spoke in the assembly.Gituanja moved a motion to adjourn sittings for a week for members to attend the devolution conference. The motion was seconded by Aguthi MCA Wachira Waruru. Waruru said, &ldquo;I am sad the governor&rsquo;s brother blamed us for what happened to him. Given the level of anger expressed towards us during the swearing in ceremony of the new governor, it is only safe to stay away. He said MCAs have previously been attacked by hired goons.&ldquo;I suggest we go about our business and stay away from the funeral. We read malice in the manner we are being treated,&rdquo; Waruru said. Konyu MCA James Kahiga urged his colleagues to stay away from the funeral.About 20,000 mourners are expected to attend the funeral service, and President Uhuru Kenyatta will be the chief guest.Police have beefed up security in Mathira.
