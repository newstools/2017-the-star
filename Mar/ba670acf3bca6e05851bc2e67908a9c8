The Court of Appeal yesterday declined to stop fresh tendering for the supply of ballot papers in a decision seen to remove hurdles which might have delayed the general election.Judges Alnashir Visram, Wanjiru Karanja and Jamila Mohammed refused to give temporary order sought by a Dubai-based company, which was initially awarded the tender.They said the printing firm has the opportunity to participate in the fresh tendering. Taking into consideration the circumstances of this case we find that the intended appeal would not be rendered nugatory if we do not grant the orders sought, the judges held.Secondly, the judges noted that Al Ghurair Printing and Publishing Company did not demonstrate how it will suffer loss if the fresh tendering process takes place.Thirdly the judges said given that the election is scheduled for August 8 granting orders sought by the firm will interfere with the IEBC s preparation, and this will go against public interest.The decision of the appeal does not shut the firm out completely, as it gives it a chance to file substantive suit to pursue its claim by seeking compensation for cancellation of tender in the event its case is successful.Cord had challenged the tender award and after hearing the arguments, High Court judge George Odunga on February 13 nullified the tender award.He said the IEBC did not comply with the amended Election Laws of 2016.Odunga further directed IEBC to tender afresh and follow the laid down law for the supply of ballot papers.The printing firm moved to the Court of Appeal after the tender was nullified. It said the judge had erred in law.
