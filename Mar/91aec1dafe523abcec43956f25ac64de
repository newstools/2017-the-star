Former Football Kenya Federation president Sam Nyamweya has threatened legal action against the federation after reportedly being banned for all football activities for ten years by governing body&rsquo;s National Executive.On Tuesday the NEC they had slapped the lengthy ban against Nyamweya for allegedly lodging a case against the federation in an ordinary court, violating Article 13 (f) of the FKF constitution in addition to allegedly admitting to withdrawing Sh2m from the federation account.The money accodring to FKF, was mean for the FKF Aberdares branch. Nyamweya alleged that the timing of the meeting purporting to suspend him one year after he retired indicated personal vendetta against him.&ldquo;After a careful perusal of the contents of the correspondence dated March 27th 2017, the meeting purporting to have suspended me was convened &ldquo;on 21st of March 2016&rdquo;, which is more than a year ago and just over a month following my retirement from football and handing over to my successor, Nick Mwendwa. Further evidence of the malice, bad faith and preposterous intentions of the decision is contained in their taking more than one year to convey the same to me but the obvious inference from this is that the decision was premeditated because the matter being referred to is a case I filed in 2007,&rdquo; Nyamweya observed.&ldquo;Having retired from football activities in the full glare of the cameras before the whole world, there is no possibility that I am still a member of FKF and it is therefore misguided of the FKF NEC to purport to suspend an individual who is not on their role of members.&rdquo;Nyamweya pointed out that the matter in court, for which he has been supposedly punished, is premised on his right to institute legal proceedings against anybody as enshrined in the Constitution of Kenya 2010 ostensibly to compel FKF to honor their obligations and defend the rights of clubs and players who were suffering as a result of the feud that was going on in regard to Club Licensing Regulations.&ldquo;It is imperative to note that the same FKF filed an objection on the admissibility of the case before the High Court but the Honorable Court ruled that I had a right to file the suit and the court had the jurisdiction to hear the matter to its logical conclusion. It is therefore pretentious and sub-judicial of FKF to now turn around and hide in the provisions of their own constitution over the matter substantively before the judiciary and this opens the way for me to sue for contempt of court,&rdquo; charged Nyamweya.The former FKF president who stepped down from his position barely hours before the vote that saw Mwendwa overwhelmingly elected added that it is laughable that FKF can suggest that he withdrew any money from their accounts because he had never done it and he would be moving with speed to sue for character assassination and damages.
