After finishing ninth at the World Cross Country Championships in Uganda over the weekend, World U-20 5,000m silver medallist Emmaculate Chepkirui, has turned her focus on the 2017 World U-18 championships set for Nairobi in July.The 17-year-old, who has a personal best of 15:31.12 over the 5,000m will, however, have to drop a distance lower to 3,000m since the former youth event does not feature in the 12-lap race.&ldquo;I am happy with my performance in Kampala. It was my first attempt at the world cross and finishing ninth can only be a sign of better things to come,&rdquo; said Chepkirui.&ldquo;I am now in camp, where I came directly after landing from Kampala as we continue to strategise with my coach Philip Kirui on how to tackle the World U18.&rdquo;She said she has been to three international events in the recent past, finishing second at the 2016 world U20 championships in Bydgoszcz, Poland, behind Ethiopian Kalkidan Fentie and again second to compatriot Sandra Felis Chebet at the 2016 Africa Junior Championships in Tanzania, before the ninth place finish in Kampala.&ldquo;I have been finishing second in the two major track events that I have participated and I feel it is time I worked harder to win a gold medal,&rdquo; said Chepkirui, who is based in Sotik.&ldquo;The build-up I underwent before the world cross and my participating in the event proper isan addded advantage for me since I feel I am now better off and I have the endurance to go all the way.&rdquo;Chepkirui will be joined by fellow world U-20 bronze medallist, Wesley Ledama, who finished 10th in Kampala alongside eighth-placed Edwin Kiplagat.
