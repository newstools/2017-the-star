A civil society group is investigating reports of five missing albino children from Tana River, amid fears they could have been dismembered for witchcraft.Haki Africa said the children are aged below 12 years. Co-ordinator Francis Auma said they received information from their contact in Tana River about the missing children.The children disappeared from their homes last week and are yet to be traced. They may have been kidnapped but no one has so far contacted the families. Auma said they suspect the children may have been ferried to Tanzania for witchcraft.&ldquo;We are yet to receive any concrete information from the police but we suspect the children might be in Tanzania,&rdquo; Auma said.Cases of missing children, especially albinos, increase in election years because their body parts are highly valued in witchcraft &mdash; for charms to ensure election victory &mdash; and fetch high prices.In other cases, they are believed to bring bad luck.According to the United Nations, at least 75 albinos were killed in East Africa between 2000 and 2015.They say the number of reported attacks represent a fraction of the total as most are secret rituals in rural areas. Auma said they have reported to the police and immigration officers at the Lunga Lunga and Taveta border. &ldquo;We expect to receive information on whether there are any records of albino children being crossed to our neighbouring country,&rdquo; he said.A Haki Africa team is in Tanzania to look for the children. Auma expressed fears such cases will increase during the electioneering period, especially with the beliefs surrounding people living with albinism.&ldquo;We suspect there may be a cartel behind this case which needs to be dismantled,&rdquo; he said. Auma urged parents with albino children to be cautious with their children as they might be targeted for witchcraft.
