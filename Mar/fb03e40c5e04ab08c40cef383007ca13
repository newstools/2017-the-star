Police on Saturday gunned down four armed Pokots who attempted to block the burial of 10 killed in banditry attacks. The four had confronted the officers at Mukutani, Baringo South Sub-County while escorting the bodies of six women and four children. The burial ceremony of the bandit attack victims was temporarily disrupted following the shootout. "Our vehicle was attacked. The bandits sprayed bullets on our cars in the presence of heavy security KDF. God forbid," a mourner said. He said they were ambushed at the Tikaluk bridge as the cars slowed down on bad sections of the road. The women and children were from the Ilchamus community. They were shot on Tuesday last week. The same day, two Pokot women were shot dead in a police lorry on their way to Kabarnet town. Baringo county police commander Peter Ndungu said they have deployed enough officers to the area. Most of the security officials are engaged in Laikipia where invaders have overrun the area. Ilchamus spokesperson Amos Olempaka condemned the killings adding that KDF operation in the area is yet to be felt. "The armed Pokot bandits are still regrouping. KDF have been here for seven days yet we haven't seen their impact," he said. On Thursday, Olempaka led a team of 10 petitioners to Kabarnet High court to file a case against Tiaty MP Asman Kamama and Baringo Speaker William Kamket. The two are accused of incitement.
