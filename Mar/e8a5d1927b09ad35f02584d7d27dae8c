Church leaders have been urged to stop allowing politicians to use pulpits to play politics.Murang a Governor Mwangi Wairia on Friday said churches should be preserved for worshipping God and not spreading falsehood. He said politicking in church amounts to blasphemy. I ve avoided taking my politics to God s house because I know it is not right. The church should be preserved for its sacred role, Wairia said. Even if it s me, if you know I will use your churches to malign other people, deny me a chance to address your congregation. He was addressing about 700 religious leaders from the county. Wairia accused some local politicians, whom he did not name, of using pulpits to talk ill of others, saying they violate the sanctity of churches. Such politicians will face God s wrath, he said.
