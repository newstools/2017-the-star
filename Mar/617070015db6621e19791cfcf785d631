The Kakamega governor race has now taken shape after ANC cleared Nairobi lawyer Michael Osundwa to fly its flag against political giants Wycliffe Oparanya (incumbent, ODM) and Senator Boni Khalwale of Ford Kenya. Also in the race is former Medical Services minister Amukowa Anangwe and businesswoman Mabel Muruli, who will first face off in the Jubilee primaries. Osundwa is a Wanga from Mumias West subcounty. His entry into the fray could be a big dent on Oparanya’s reelection bid. The community backed the incumebtn in 2013. The latest move ends speculation that ANC would support Oparanya and reduces the Kakamega race to a game of numbers and sheer balance of communities’ interests. Media analyst Martin Andati yesterday said the choice of a running mate will determine Osundwa’s performance. Both Oparanya and Khalwale have picked their running mates from Malava.
