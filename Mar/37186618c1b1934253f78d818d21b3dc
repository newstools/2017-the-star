The final Budget of Jubilee Party&rsquo;s first term indicates that government should borrow less and stop wastage.Jubilee has produced a number of good Budgets but implementation has been wanting &ndash; sometimes massively.A case in point is the Kenya Pipeline&rsquo;s abandonment of an old but functional 16-inch pipeline upgraded to 20-inch and its replacement by a totally new 20-inch system at practically no technical advantage but at a cost of Sh40 billion.At the county government level, the governors have become the biggest clients of helicopter leasing companies since Independence, an enormous and non-essential expense.One of the most fundamental problems is that austerity measures are announced in the finest bureaucratese and almost never followed up.When the then Deputy Prime Minister Uhuru Kenyatta was minister for Finance he ensured that most senior bureaucrats gave up their fuel-guzzling limos for VW Passats of no more than 2800cc.As President, Kenyatta has presided over a Cabinet and bureaucracy that have brought back the guzzlers with a vengeance.
