Sergio Ramos headed a late winner as Real Madrid recovered from a howler by keeper Keylor Navas to beat 10-man Real Betis to go top of La Liga.Navas escaped a red card for fouling Darko Brasanac, then spilled Antonio Sanabria's shot into his own net.Cristiano Ronaldo headed Madrid level from a Marcelo cross before half-time.Betis defender Matteo Piccinini was sent off for dragging back Lucas Vazquez with 12 minutes left, before Ramos powered in a Toni Kroos corner.Morata cannot Bale out Madrid - but Ramos canCaptain Ramos has made a habit of scoring vital goals for Zinedine Zidane's side this season - most notably a last-minute equaliser against Barcelona and a late winner against Deportivo, both in December.The centre-back's power from set-pieces proved vital as Real did not quite click in attack without the suspended Gareth Bale, and with Karim Benzema named among the substitutes.Alvaro Morata, given a chance from the start, was unable to make an impact and was replaced by Benzema with 20 minutes left.Ronaldo provided his usual threat, heading a fine equaliser and seeing another goal ruled out for offside.La LigaReal Madrid's win puts them two points ahead of Barcelona, who lost 2-1 at Deportivo earlier on SundayBut it was Ramos who led by example, as Zidane's side took advantage of Barcelona's surprise 2-1 defeat at Deportivo earlier on Sunday to regain top spot.Betis betterReal Betis were beaten 6-1 at home by Real Madrid in October, not long before head coach Gus Poyet was sacked.This was a much-improved display under the guidance of Victor Sanchez, and they looked for a long time as if they would leave with at least a point.They did not create many chances - although the lively Ruben Castro did fire a good one well over in the second half.As the game wore on, their defence became increasingly stretched. Centre-back German Pezzella made a superb goal-saving challenge to deny Ronaldo on the edge of the area when any mistiming would have meant a red card.In the end, the red card went to Piccinini. Already on a yellow, he was booked again for dragging back Vazquez, as the substitute tried to latch on a sublime Marcelo pass.
