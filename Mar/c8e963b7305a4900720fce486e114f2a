NTV news anchor Larry Madowo popularly known for his entertainment dubbed The Trend, considered to be one of the biggest shows on TV, was today given the presidential treatment. He was ushered in Mombasa, at the Voyager hotel with the highest marks of respect that can be accorded any world leader, a guard of honour. This came as a surprise to him and his workmate Wallace Kantai, after they checked in at the hotel in preparations for an Interview with Mombasa governor Ali Hassan Joho. They got to inspect the small guard of honour complete with ramrod straight navy-dressed men with guns. At the tail end of it all were waiters and waitresses and the hotel management who offered them exotic cocktail drinks. "I was only joking when I tweeted but Voyager Beach mounted a guard of honour for our arrival! Mind blown," Larry tweeted shortly after the grande affair. This came after his tweet to the voyager hotel that said;  "Mombasa, standby. Voyager Beach prepare the traditional dancers." In reply to his tweet the voyager hotel said he will inspect another guard of honour on his way out.  I was only joking when I tweeted but @VoyagerBeach_Ke mounted a guard of honour for our arrival!
