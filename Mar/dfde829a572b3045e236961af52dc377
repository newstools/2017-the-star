The latest entrant into the presidential race has promised to turn 250,000 poor people into millionaires within five years.Political scientist Joseph Mburu, who will vie on August 8 on a People Empowerment Party ticket, plans to ensure each ward has at least 200 new millionaires.Mburu said his action plan will concern 1,000 deeds which will make Kenya a theatre of development that will be a showcase for the rest of the world for generations and generations to come".He said he will make Kenya a global industrial development hub and eventually move millions of families from poverty to prosperity.The aspirant added, when he announced his bid at a Nairobi hotel on Saturday, that more than 15 million homes will be earning no less than Sh300,000 per month."Mburu further said Kenya's poverty is man made but that he will cure it by eliminating corruption and creating structures for industrial growth."My victory will send the powerful signal of a new and prosperous Kenya. We have a huge reserves of lucrative natural resources. Sadly these have been mismanaged," he said."Kenyans ought to be extremely wealthy, not poor. Kenya s poverty is artificial because it is caused by poor leadership famed for being notoriously corrupt, wasteful, extravagant, uncaring and with little value to citizens lives."The aspirant said the current presidency and past regimes have failed to get rid of corruption within their ranks and Kenya's public service.Mburu said slaying the dragon of corruption in Kenya was the only way out and will come with an overhaul at the administration, to get rid of corrupt government officials.He said graft and the inefficiency of leaders have derailed development ideals and that economic growth will be determined by the success of war against the vice.The aspirant said the derailed development and problems bedeviling this country are closely linked to the presidency."The development speed, ethnic cohesion, political stability and economic growth are all based on the propensity, concentration, attitude, performance and aptitude of the holder of the presidency. If the President wanted to end corruption, tribalism and extreme poverty today it would be over," Mburu said.[VIDEO] Frustrated Uhuru scolds state officials on rampant corruptionThe former University of Regina don said he will turn the presidency and State House into institutions and agents of massive development.Mburu said he will personally keep a list of every project and that files will be placed before his desk to end the mystery of those that end up missing."Corruption has become a cash crop for Kenyan leaders. We lose about Sh608 billion to corruption every year yet we have one old radiotherapy machine serving 45 million Kenyans, with 40,000 diagnosed cancer cases annually. [People] have to wait two years to get the first chemotherapy treatment," he said."Corruption costs Kenya more than 250,000 jobs every year and Sh69 billion in the private sector, enough to build tens of factories or expand the existing ones.. It costs the economy nearly Sh3 trillion."Mburu further said it was a disgrace that in Kenya, one in three families go to bed hungry and that pupils in some areas learn under trees while sitting on stones.Read: Twice as many Cord supporters as Jubilee s go to bed hungry - IpsosAlso read: Stop voter listing drive, help starving Kenyans, Uhuru toldThe aspirant also decried the lack of social services and grinding poverty that he said caused a mother so poor to feed her children to put them on sale. My presidency is not about personal glory or politics. It s a humanitarian and a development mission to save lives. I am not persuaded by the notion that you have to be wealthy to become a president," he said."I am convinced that to be a president one needs, first and foremost, to be knowledgeable, goodhearted, faithful and able to carry the burdens of citizens as their own. My poor beginnings should not be a barrier to my becoming the president of the Republic of Kenya."
