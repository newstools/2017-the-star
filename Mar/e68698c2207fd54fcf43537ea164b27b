A House committee yesterday instructed Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet to ensure NLC chairman Muhammad Swazuri (pictured) is brought before it for questioning.The National Assembly Lands committee chaired by Tharaka MP Alex Mwiru resolved ton direct House Clerk Justin Bundi to write to Boinnet to effect their order.Swazuri failed to honour the committee&rsquo;s summons to respond to several issues falling under the National Lands Commission, including a number of petitions MPs had raised on behalf of their constituents.The NLC chairman was also to respond to the controversial Dominion Farms in Yala saga, where a foreign investor has accused NASA leader Raila Odinga and his ODM brigade from Nyanza of frustrating his businesses.Swazuri was to also shed more light on a petition challenging the renewal of land leases for white settlers in Nandi county.The charged committee took issue with Swazuri&rsquo;s decision of sending his deputy Abigael Mbagaya to represent him on grounds he was attending an urgent meeting at State House, Nairobi.&ldquo;The chairperson was planning to come before this committee personally. We were together preparing our submissions in the morning, but he received a call that he needs to be at State House,&rdquo; Mbagaya said.She was with CEO Tom Chavangi.The committee dismissed the apology as &ldquo;flimsy&rdquo; and accused Swazuri of taking them for granted.Mwiru said Swazuri has to be punished for treating with committee with contempt.&ldquo;There is insufficient evidence of his whereabouts and the only conclusion we can make is that he has refused to appear. This committee directs the clerk to issue an arrest warrant against Swazuri. Make sure he is compelled to appear and give evidence on issues that were very clear,&rdquo; he said.Rangwe MP George Oner said, &ldquo;This committee has the same powers as the High Court. You cannot be summoned by a judge and because you have been called to go meet the President, you snub the court. The decision by chair to go to State House is in bad taste.&rdquo;Rongai MP Raymond Moi said Boinnet should ensure the NLC chairman is brought before the committee without delay because he has ignored summons more than three times.A committee is empowered to instruct police to prevail on a witness who fails to honour its summonses more than three times.
