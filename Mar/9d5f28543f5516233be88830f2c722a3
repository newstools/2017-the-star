The government has rejected proposed legislation seeking to split Safaricom and M-Pesa, CS Joe Mucheru has said.The Information, Communication and Technology CS said doing so would send a negative precedent of punishing and suppressing innovative operators and discourage investment.He said M-Pesa is a national pride with more than 26 million subscribers, and has been cited in global Fintech forums.M-Pesa has earned Kenya the premier position in mobile money technology. The proposed legislative amendment to split Safaricom and M-Pesa is therefore not one supported by the government, he said.Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo proposed amendments to the communication and banking laws aimed at splitting Safaricom, which is 40 per cent owned by Britain s Vodafone.Support innovatorsMucheru said the government will support companies that exploit Kenya s rich innovative culture to design solutions that support the whole ecosystem and contribute to the country s development.The government will hasten the completion of the revised National ICT Policy and also review and finalise the draft policy on Science, Technology and Innovation, which was the basis of the Science, Technology and Innovation Act of 2013, the CS said. We are focussed on creating proper institutional frameworks to ensure that innovation activities across government are harmonised to avoid duplication of efforts and enhance effectiveness, he said.Mucheru spoke at the University of Nairobi, when he opened the Second Nairobi Innovation Week on behalf of President Uhuru Kenyatta.He urged local universities and the private sector to collaborate and innovate together and transform Africa. If our society is not innovative, others will come and exploit our resources, particularly our new-found oil and mineral deposits, and minimal benefits will cascade to the populace, Mucheru said.
