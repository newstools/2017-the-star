Communication service provider Safaricom on Thursday launched a customer-centric tariff that will enable subscribers to fully utilise airtime purchases.The new service, aptly named FLEX, allows users to allocate airtime for calls, text messages or data services.On signing up, subscribers will be able to convert their airtime into FLEX units that will then be charged proportionately to usage of minutes, data or text messages.Each FLEX unit is worth 3MB of data, or 20 seconds of a phone call, or three text messages.Presently, bundles or airtime is purchased in pre-determined fixed amounts.The FLEX service will offer three options; daily FLEX (charged at Sh99 for 115 FLEX units), weekly FLEX (Sh599 for 700 FLEX units) and monthly FLEX (Sh2499 for 3,100 FLEX units).Additionally &lsquo;FLEX&rsquo; customers will earn loyalty points when they send more than Sh100 via M-Pesa.&ldquo;As part of our strategic objective of putting the customer first, we are designing and delivering products and services that meet the exact needs of our different customer segments,"&nbsp; Safaricom CEO Bob Collymore said.All Safaricom customers can access the FLEX proposition using the short code *100# for pre-paid customers and *200# for Postpaid customers.Subscribers can roll over unused FLEX points to the next day, week or month by renewing their subscription before they expire."With &lsquo;FLEX&rsquo;, we are offering freedom and flexibility to our customers to navigate across our different products without restrictions," Collymore added.
