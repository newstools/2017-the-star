The confusion by truck drivers at Mlolongo weighbridges is to blame for the traffic snarl up, Athi River Weighbridge Station operations manager Peter Njoroge has said.Motorists have complained over the snarl up at Mlolongo, which has been experienced at the section for two weeks, especially between 5.30am-7.30am.The government introduced new weighing sections for the trucks. Passenger matatus and buses at Mlolongo have been picking commuters in the area, blocking the trucks and worsening the situation. The traffic police are accused of doing little to address the jam.Njoroge said the majority of the drivers using Mombasa Road are not used to the new changes. The two new static weighbridges in Mlolongo town only became operational two weeks ago.He said both Nairobi and Mombasa-bound trucks were used to driving on the innermost lane.Njoroge spoke to the Star at his office at Mlolongo&rsquo;s old weighbridge station. He said the location of the new weighbridge meant for weighing Nairobi-bound trucks has forced drivers to use the left side, as opposed to the innermost lanes, which they were used to.
