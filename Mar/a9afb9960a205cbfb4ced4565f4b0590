Bungoma Governor&nbsp;Kenneth Lusaka left residents in stitches when he&nbsp;begged 'Johnny Walker' to help him seduce widows.It was&nbsp;not clear where he was but a group appeared to have been on an outing.Lusaka was&nbsp;on Thursday&nbsp;caught on camera saying:&nbsp;"We know you are Johnny Walker Black Label celebrating 12 years. We know you fear neither governors nor any other person."Speaking in the Luhya language while tapping a bottle of Johnny Walker, he continued:&nbsp;"Energise our crucial body organs to perform progressive work, be it seducing widows."&nbsp;Dressed in a Jubilee t-shirt and black trousers, the county chief&nbsp;beseeched the alcohol not to "muddle our minds and render us useless."The county boss&nbsp;asked Johnny Walker not to deplete their strength or push them to bestiality."Help us perform what you mandated us.&nbsp;As we open the bottle, we proceed knowing Masinde Muliro, Wachiye Wanaumbwa and all those who left us. The late [William] Ntimama has joined them and baba Lusaka is also there," he said.He appeared to be sprinkling some of the alcohol on the ground, a practice some undertake to honour ancestors.Amid laughs by residents, the Governor further asked the alcohol to give them&nbsp;strength in the knees."...and all body organs especially the lower abdomen for proper use.&nbsp;Okay, you may the music now play," he said.Lusaka could not be reached for comment.
