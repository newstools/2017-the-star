The Music Copyright Society Of Kenya has been denied a license to collect royalties on behalf of Kenyan musicians after it failed to produce its latest audited financial statements. To fill in this void, the Board of Directors of Kenya Copyright Board (KECOBO) has approved the licensing of Music Publishers Association of Kenya Limited (MPAKE) to collect royalties on behalf of authors, composers and publishers from March 2017 to February 2018 effective immediately. The decision was made after the MPAKE satisfied the requirements of Section 46 of the Copyright Act, 2001 and Regulation 15 and 16 of the Copyright Regulations 2004.The Board made the decision today after reviewing applications from two new applicants; National Music Copyright Society of Kenya Limited (NAMCOS) and Music Publishers Association of Kenya Limited (MPAKE) against the application for renewal by Music Copyright Society of Kenya Limited (MCSK).The Board rejected the application for renewal by MCSK after it failed to fulfill conditions attached to its last license amongst other reasons.Also read: MCSK Nairobi director reveals 'rot' in the societyThe KECOBO Board of Directors also rejected the application for collecting license by National Music Copyright Society (NAMCOS) noting it failed to demonstrate its capacity to roll out collection if granted a license.More here --&gt; Kenyan musicians demand MCSK clean-up!
