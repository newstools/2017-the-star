Hawkers have been barred from operating on First and Second Avenue, Eastleigh.Senior resident magistrate Isaac Orenge on Monday cancelled an order issued on February 24 allowing the hawkers to do business on those streets.He said the court cannot allow hawkers to trade on the roads in violation of the Nairobi Planning Laws.The Eastleigh Hawkers Association obtained the order stopping the county from evicting or forbidding them from doing business on the streets until the hearing of their application. They said the county promised they will not be evicted until an alternative area was found.But the county went to court and succeeded in having the order by the Milimani magistrate&rsquo;s court cancelled.
