Almost half of Kenyans, at 43 per cent, went to bed hungry in the past three months, while another 65 per cent skipped meals due to lack of money to over the same period.Survey findings released yesterday by Twaweza East Africa revealed that eight out of every 10 Kenyans are facing financial constraints, about half of them, at 49 per cent, forego certain basic needs to survive.The report comes at a time when latest statistics from the National Drought Management Authority indicate that about three million Kenyans in 23 counties face starvation due to prolonged drought and famine.The figure is an upsurge from 1.3 million Kenyans that were reported to be at risk of starvation in 11 counties in October last year.A report by the Kenya Food Security Steering Group released early last month said the numbers represent about 20 per cent of the population in pastoral areas and 18 per cent in marginal agricultural areas.It listed Turkana, Marsabit, Samburu, Tana River, Isiolo, Mandera, Garissa, Wajir and Baringo as the worst-hit.The Twaweza report says as a survival tactic, 72 per cent of households in urban and rural areas have had to eat less than they should, 74 per cent eat less healthy food and 76 per cent eat less variety to survive.Fourteen per cent went for loans, four per cent sought help from family and friends or sold family assets, while three per cent used their savings.&ldquo;Others had to forego buying clothes and paying school fees, and went to the cheapest hospitals for medical care,&rdquo; Twaweza representative Victor Rateng&rsquo; said.Forty-four per cent of households with schoolchildren had to withdraw them from school in the past six months as they could not afford fees or learning material, the report said.&ldquo;Most Kenyans make difficult choices everyday between basic needs. Even those slightly better off are living on a knife-edge at the mercy of price shocks or personal misfortune that harm their ability to earn an income,&rdquo; director of Data and Voice at Twaweza said John Mugo said. In 2013, the NBS the Society for International Development said 45 per cent of Kenyans lived below the poverty line.
