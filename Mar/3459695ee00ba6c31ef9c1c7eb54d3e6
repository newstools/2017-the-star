Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya yesterday lost his final petition aimed at blocking his trial over an assault incident that happened nine years ago.The Supreme Court has dismissed an appeal he had filed seeking to block the Director of Public Prosecutions from trying him for allegedly assaulting a rival's supporter on April 17, 2008, in Mabole.Justices Jackton Ojwang and Isaac Lenaola dismissed his last appeal said the governor did not provide enough reasons to warrant the court to terminate the criminal case. The grounds raised in the present application do not provide a basis for the grant of stay; moreover, it will not, in our opinion, be in the public interest to do so, the judges ruled.Oparanya was charged on May 2, 2013, at the Butere principal magistrate s court with the offence of assaulting John Ojwang' Waka.He moved to the High Court challenging his trial on grounds that it was instituted four years later, hence a violation of his rights and an abuse of legal process.His contention was that being taken to court four years later was malicious.Justice Anthony Mrima dismissed his application for lack of merit and directed the governor face trial.But before the lower court picked a date, Oparanya filed an appeal at the Kisumu courts.By a Judgment delivered on 29 July, 2016, Appeal Court judges David Maranga (now Chief Justice), Daniel Musinga and Gatembe Kairu upheld the High Court s verdictOparanya was again dissatisfied with the decision of the Court of Appeal, prompting the current case at the Supreme Court.He told the Supreme Court that the judges who handled his case were wrong in failing to hold that the four-year delay was reasonable,But the Supreme Court justices said although the Constitution requires timely disposal of trials, the issue of delay as argued by the governor does not meet the threshold of arguability or purposes of halting his trial .
