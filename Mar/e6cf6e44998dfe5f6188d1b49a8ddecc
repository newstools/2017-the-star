The number of births at the Naivasha Subcounty Hospital have been increasing since the beginning of the year, despite the ongoing doctors&rsquo; strike. Statistics show the facility delivers between 20-25 newborns every day. In December, the maternity wing recorded only 10 births as patients sought services elsewhere after the strike started. Only four doctors are attending to patients at the hospital, which serves patients from the neighbouring counties of Kiambu, Narok and Nyandarua. Medical superintendent Dr Joseph Mburu said the Nakuru government&rsquo;s decision to hire more nurses last year is bearing fruit. He said services in the maternity wing are back to normal. &ldquo;We are now recording up to 25 births every day and this is a big improvement from December, when we recorded 10 births for the whole month,&rdquo; Mburu said. He said the effects of the doctors&rsquo; strike are, however, being felt. &ldquo;Only four doctors are serving all the departments, which has stretched our services. But we are doing all we can to save lives,&rdquo; Mburu said. He decried the high number of unclaimed bodies at the hospital&rsquo;s mortuary. Mburu said they have 13 of them.
