The High Court has allowed the examination council and human rights activist Okiya Omtatah to become party to a case challenging low KCPE exam resulsts last yar.The suit was filed by 89 parents at a private school. They say their children deserve higher marks. Sitting in Mombasa, judge Eric Ogola granted the Kenya National Examination Council and Omtatah seven days to file submissions. Knec&rsquo;s lawyer Geoffrey Obura said there was a delay in the timelines issued by the court.Omtatah also requested the court to grant him more time to file submissions. On January 11, he sought to be enjoined in the suit, citing public interest. The parents of Nyali Primary School and Kindergarten want Knec compelled to present exam scripts of pupils who sat the exam at the school. They want the answer scripts cross-checked to ensure validity, reliability and accuracy in allocating marks. Omtatah said he has information and evidence of other anomalies regarding integrity of the results. The parents also want verification and adjudication of the captured marks.The parents say the marks awarded to their children do not reflect their ability or the school&rsquo;s performance over the years. Parents&rsquo; lawyer Macmillan Jengo said they need transparency and accountability in the processing, verification and adjudication of the marks.The parents said it is important to do a manual check of the work by the optical scanner. They say despite their requests for verification and re-tally, the council has refused. Justice Ogola directed parties to highlight their submissions on March 21.
