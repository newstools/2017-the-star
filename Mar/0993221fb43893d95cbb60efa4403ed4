A man who was found murdered in Gitaru, Kabete, alongside three others, was buried yesterday in Ndeiya village, Limuru subcounty.David Chege, 49, was buried on his father Samuel Ndung&rsquo;u&rsquo;s land together with his 22-year-old son Alex Ngugi, who is alleged to have been shot dead by AP officers in Dandora, Nairobi.Chege was an ophthalmic nurse. His body was found stashed in a Toyota Succeed on Wednesday last week.Residents described the deaths as a huge loss to the family, asking the police to hasten investigations so the culprits are charged.Led by Gideon Gachara, residents urged the family to be patient with investigations, but follow up on every detail.The family spokesperson Joseph Gatuhi, Chege&rsquo;s brother, said they are unhappy with how the police are handling investigations.Gatuhi said his brother&rsquo;s troubles started when he went to the Kinyago AP camp to follow up how his son was murdered. &ldquo;The son was shot dead on Monday and his father went to the AP camp. Later the following day, he hired a car for the unfinished businesses, but he went missing only to be found at Gitaru on Wednesday having been murdered. Family members only saw his body at the mortuary,&rdquo; he said.Gatuhi was accompanied by their younger brother pastor Simon Kaminwa, who said the family was being victimised for Chege&rsquo;s criminal past.&ldquo;He was locked up there [prison] and he came out as a reformed person, but people are using the issue to insult our family. This is very bad,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;He came out many years ago and formed an organisation called Turning Point and he used to empower people, preach and changed so many people&rsquo;s lives,&rdquo; Kaminwa said.Gatuhi urged the police to hasten probe so the truth can be known. He said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been left with so many unanswered questions in our hearts.&rdquo;
