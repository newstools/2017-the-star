The political party nominations season preparatory to the general election is around the corner. The IEBC have set April 13 to 26 as the nominations period.The history of political party nominations in Kenya is one of a time of electoral fraud, violence and bribery. Everything is done in every party to subvert the electorate s will and to produce results that cannot stand scrutiny.It is a time when losers are declared winners and winners are pronounced losers.And yet the nominations are the beginning of a free, fair, clean and transparent main event the general election itself.This year s poll scheduled for August 8 will be a major test of democracy in this country. Shoving preferred candidates down the electorate s throat will not do. Dishing out direct tickets will mean nominations and an election without integrity.The candidates too have a responsibility they are not mere inanimate pawns on a chessboard.The August 8 general election will be won and, or lost at the nominations.
