An AP officer, who is being treated as the main suspect in the brutal murder of human rights lawyer Willie Kimani, headed an undercover police unit.Yesterday, the court heard that Sergeant Fredrick Leliman led a team of five plainclothes officers, whose job was to that patrol the Mlolongo area and organise operations to bust criminals.The unit, known as &ldquo;Spiv&rdquo;, had been formed by a former Mlolongo OCS.The OCS died a few days before Kimani, his client Josephat Mwenda and driver Joseph Muiruri were kidnapped and brutally murdered.Leliman is charged alongside Leonard Maina, a member of the Spiv unit and police informer Peter Kamau.Leliman, Maina, Kamau, Stephen Chebulet and Silvia Wanjiku face charges for the June 23, 2016 murders.Testifying before Justice Jessi Lesiit yesterday, Mlolongo OCS Stephen Lelei said the informer had worked with the police way before 2011.&ldquo;I met him in 2011, while I was working at Kabete. I know him as a police informer and he gave me information on about three cases,&rdquo; Lelei said.The officer also told the court that immediately he was transferred to Mlolongo in May last year, the informer went to see him.The OCS, however, denied introducing him to the Spiv unit or to Leliman, saying he does not know how the two met.&ldquo;When I was transferred to Mlolongo, Kamau came to see me, but I can&rsquo;t remember the date. He came to my office about three times,&rdquo; the officer said.
