The Mtongwe Channel &mdash; site of the 1994 tragedy that claimed 272 lives &mdash; must be cleansed so another ferry disaster does not occur, elders have said.They said the channel has nuksi (bad omen) and tambiko rituals must be performed to make the channel safe.Yesterday, the elders said the dark spirits that caused the accident are yearning for more blood, hence, a similar tragedy might occur. They said this can be avoided if they &ldquo;pray and offer cows to the gods.&rdquo;Some animals will be slaughtered, their meat shared among those present. Other animals are to be drowned.Kenya Ferry Services is said to have bought three cows. Mijikenda traditions dictate remains of the offerings be eaten at the site of the ritual and no one can take any portion home. Likoni MP Masoud Mwahima said more cows were slaughtered for a celebration, not for sacrifice.
