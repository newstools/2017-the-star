NASA should nominate its presidential flagbearer as soon as possible, Vihiga Senator George Khaniri has urged. Speaking during a rally on Sunday in the Caltex Ground in Likoni, Mombasa, he said Kenyans are ready to support any of the four principals &mdash; Raila Odinga (ODM), Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper), Musalia Mudavadi (ANC) and Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula (Ford Kenya). The four have signed an agreement to form a coalition ahead of the August polls, but they are yet to decide on a flagbearer. Khaniri said Kenyans are tired of the Jubilee administration under President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto and NASA is the only alternative. &ldquo;We have faith and confidence in Raila, Mudavadi, Wetang&rsquo;ula and Kalonzo to bring about changes. We urge you to decide on a flagbearer and Kenyans will stand with you,&rdquo; he said. Khaniri accompanied Mudavadi on his two-day tour. He said Kenyans are ready to back any NASA candidate.
