Opposition leader Raila Odinga yesterday left for South Africa to visit his eldest daughter Rosemary, who is receiving treatment for a noncancerous brain tumour.Rosemary has a meningioma and was flown to South Africa on February 28 for further treatment. She had been admitted at the Aga Khan and Nairobi hospitals for eight days.Rosemary is Raila s most politically active child and an aspirant for the Kibra MP seat.Raila announced his trip on Twitter and said he will be away for a little more than a week. He departed a few minutes after 7am from the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport aboard a Kenya Airways plane. Over the weekend, I will travel to the USA from South Africa for a number of engagements. Keep well and see you all soon, he said.On March 2, Rosemary wrote Kenyans a goodwill message for the new month. A new month signifies new beginnings. If things did not go your way in February, March is offering you a second chance. Make good use of it. I wish you all a blessed month, she said on her Facebook page.The post was shared at least 100 times, liked by more than 6,200 people and attracted 963 comments, wishing her well.Raila this week suffered a bout of food poisoning. He was treated at Karen Hospital on Wednesday.Raila thanked Kenyans for their prayers, messages of solidarity, love and support. The health scare came in the wake of his heightened public activities, the latest being a series of campaigns for mass voter registration.The ODM leader led his troops to Meru before embarking on a trip to the official opening of Olusegun Obasanjo s presidential library.On his return, he went to the burial of first Nyeri Governor Nderitu Gachagua on Monday.The 72-year-old NASA captain dispelled misunderstanding on his sickness. It was a case of food poisoning, which is not the same thing as being poisoned, he said in a statement on Thursday. I know many Kenyans encounter this problem from time to time. It can cause quite a scare and indeed it did to me.
