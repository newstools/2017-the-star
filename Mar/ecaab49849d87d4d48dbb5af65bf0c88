Kenyans don&rsquo;t have rock-solid, overwhelming confidence in the justice system, a worrying trend in an election year when poll disputes will be adjudicated.At least 33 per cent of Jubilee supporters have &ldquo;a lot of confidence&rdquo; in the judiciary, compared to 10 per cent by opposition backers, an Ipsos poll indicates.The same is replicated for the Supreme Court, in which 39 per cent of Jubilee supporters say they have confidence, compared to 13 per cent for opposition backers.However, more than half ( 62 per cent) of Kenyans have faith in the judiciary, with 22 per cent saying they have &ldquo;a lot of confidence&rdquo;, it says.The poll released yesterday indicates 26 per cent of the respondents say they have &ldquo;a lot of confidence&rdquo; in the Supreme Court, which gets a 66 per cent overall approval rating.The poll was conducted between January 9 and 26. Some 2,057 Kenyans aged 18 years and above in 42 counties were interviewed.There were three language-options &ndash; English, Swahili and Somali &mdash; and data was collected through face-to-face interviews using smartphones.The margin of error is +/- 2.15 with a 95 per cent confidence level.Interestingly, more than half ( 56 per cent) of Kenyans cannot identify an important &ldquo;recent change&rdquo; in the judiciary. However, 41 per cent know about the appointment of Chief Justice David Maraga.Only 13 per cent could say they knew about the appointment of Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu. Only eight per cent could mention that of Justice Isaac Lenaola to the Supreme Court. &ldquo;Notwithstanding such overall low levels of awareness of these appointments, there is a clear correlation of education with such information: nearly four times as many of those with any university-level education ( 77 per cent) are aware of Maraga&rsquo;s appointment as are those with only primary school education or below ( 20 per cent),&rdquo; Ipsos says.The poll also shows overall, support for devolution remains high, with about four in five Kenyans approving of it.However, such support is somewhat higher among Cord/NASA ( 88 per cent) than Jubilee supporters ( 76 per cent). &ldquo;Whether this is due to the poorer performance of county governments in this region or rather, a perception devolution itself is in a &ldquo;competition&rdquo; with the national government/the presidency, is unclear,&rdquo; Ipsos says. For those who support devolution, by far the most frequent reason is closer or better access to offices or officials.For those opposed, two reasons are offered far more often than any others &mdash; increased corruption and the higher cost to the public.
