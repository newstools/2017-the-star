Michael Sialai has officially taken over as the new National Assembly Clerk. This is after Justin Bundi yesterday called it a day at the helm of the leadership of the House. Tuesday was his last day in office as he has been on a two-month terminal leave, pending retirement. He has retired upon attaining 60 years, the compulsory retirement age for civil servants. Bundi has had a chequered career, including serving as a former Clerk of the East African Legislative Assembly from 2004 for five years. In 2009, he resumed duty at the National Assembly and served as chairman in the Committee on Implementation of the Constitution, Tender Committee, Projects Management Committee, and vice chairman of the Steering Committee of the Centre for Parliamentary Studies and Training. He took over as Clerk of the National Assembly from Patrick Gichohi, who retired in 2012. Sialai, known for his easy-going nature with staff, journalists and regular visitors to Parliament, was described as an officer with a deep understanding of parliamentary jurisdictions.
