The stalemate between the negotiating parties in the doctors&rsquo; strike, which is in its 95th day today, should end. It has caused massive suffering.The national government&rsquo;s withdrawal of its 50 per cent offer and the Council of Governors&rsquo; order to doctors to end the strike on pain of being sacked from county hospitals were both rash decisions.Both sides need lessons in Negotiation 101, the art of give and take. And they need to check in their arrogance and melodrama at the door to the negotiating room, all the pathetic posturing and grandstanding.All manner of allegations have been made on both sides, including that the doctors&rsquo; union has been following an outsiders&rsquo; script (allegedly the opposition&rsquo;s). President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s intervention also comes from outside the negotiating teams.The doctors are clearly wary about being taken for granted ever again and the question of trust looms large indeed.Both sides must make sacrifices &ndash; and the doctors must go back to saving life and limb.
