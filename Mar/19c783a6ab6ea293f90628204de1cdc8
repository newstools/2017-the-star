Safaricom has appointed former ICT Permanent secretary Bitange Ndemo to its board amid mounting pressure by lawmakers to break its business into independent entities.Ndemo's influence in public sector will be critical for Safaricom in its push to retain stranglehold of its flagship M-Pesa, which could be broken into an independent financial services businesses because of dominance claims.Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo has proposed changes to the telecoms law that if passed would see telecommunication companies face stricter regulation.MPs on Wednesday failed to agree on an amendment bill seeking to bar mobile telephony service providers from venturing into other businesses.In the debate on the motion moved by Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo, Safaricom was put on notice for monopoly and being an unfair player in the sector.Midiwo, in his presentation, said most of the mobile telephony companies had violated the terms of their licenses by running parallel businesses.He wants Section 25 (a) of the Kenya Information and Communications Act, 1998 Schedule amended.Midiwo said this &ldquo;will compel all mobile telephony service providers to incorporate a local company in case they want to do extra businesses.&rdquo;The legislator accused Safaricom of being an unfair player in the sector, adding that locals only have 25 per cent stake in the entity.Britain's Vodafone is the major shareholder in Safaricom, controlling a 40 per cent stake.The National Treasury owns 35 per cent.On Thursday, Safaricom announced the appointment of two new directors- Ndemo at non-executive capacity and Vivek Badrinath representing Vodafone.&ldquo;Badrinath and Ndemo are seasoned telecommunications professionals. The appointment of two new directors in line with its commitment to building a sustainable enterprise,&rdquo; Safaricom chairman Nicholas Ng'ang'a said in a statement.Ndemo&rsquo;s appointment is however seen as a strategy to use his experience in government to make informed decisions, mainly from the regulatory perspective.&ldquo;Both board members will bring vast talent and understanding of the global business landscape, as well as unique insights into the world of telecommunications to our business. Our board will be enriched by their knowledge which will enhance Safaricom&rsquo;s ability to navigate an increasingly multifaceted industry,&rdquo; the telco said in a statement.Ndemo served as Information and Communication PS between 2005 and 2013.During his tenure in government, he initiated several transformative projects including infrastructural and development programs, as well as marketing Kenya as a business destination.He currently lectures on entrepreneurship and research methods at the University of Nairobi.Midiwo has set a platform that could have telecommunication companies split their businesses and have different accounting systems for each business, besides forcing industry regulators to issue different licenses for each line of business. If passed, companies would have six months to comply with the new laws or face fines of up to Sh10 million. Their top management also risk a jail term of up to two years.Midiwo&rsquo;s proposals may lock out mobile money from the definition of telecommunication services. It means operators would need a separate licence which could come from the Central Bank of Kenya.
