Lecturers have finally accepted the Sh10 billion they had initially rejected, and called off their strike after signing the 2013-2017 CBA.This marks the first salary review for academic staff in public universities since 2010.The lecturers had been on strike for 54 days.University Academic Staff Union secretary general Constantine Wasonga said the association reached the decision to save the higher education sector from collapse and to end students&rsquo; suffering.He sought to assure lecturers the union had secured the best deal under the circumstances. The CBA period is due to expire in three months.Uasu will take Sh6 billion following negotiations with the Inter-Public Universities Council Consultative Forum.The remaining Sh4 billion will be shared among members of the Kenya University Staff Union and the Kenya Union of Domestic, Hotels, Educational Institutions, Hospitals and Allied Workers.The new deal gives lecturers a 17.5 per cent increase in basic salary and 3.9 per cent in house allowance. The CBA, which became effective on July 1, 2013, will be implemented from June 30, 2017.&ldquo;We have agreed on the schedules as they are,&rdquo; Wasonga said. This means staff affiliated to Uasu will receive arrears accrued since July 1, 2013. Beneficiaries include professors, associate professors, senior lecturers, lecturers, assistant lecturers, tutorial fellows, and graduate assistants.Wasonga said tutors from the Maasai Mara University will be excluded from the package as they were previously awarded higher increments. He said Kusu and Kudheiha will have to negotiate a deal for their members out of the remaining Sh4 billion.
