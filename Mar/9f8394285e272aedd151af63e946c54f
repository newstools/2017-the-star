A season of abundance is in the offing for beleaguered former premier league champions sofapaka as they are set to unveil budding sports betting firm, Betika as their new sponsors today. Club President Elly Kalekwa confirmed yesterday that the deal has already been thrashed out and they were looking forward to a launch that will change the fortunes of Sofapaka&ldquo;We have been in talks for months now and finally we have reached a deal with Betika for a period of three years. The club will now be in good financial health and our players and technical bench can now fully focus on achieving results on the pitch,&rdquo; said Kalekwa, who declined to divulge the financial details of the deal prior to its official unveiling this morning. The 2009 champions, who revolutionised Kenyan football landscape in terms of players wages and salaries, have endured financial difficulties in the last couple of years, culminating in their ejection from this season&rsquo;s SportPesa Premier League by the Football Kenya Federation over failure to breach the stringent Club Licensing Rules that were enforced at the back end of last season, only for the Sports Disputes Tribunal to come to their rescue at the eleventh hour.&ldquo;All that is behind us and now we have a sponsor and our players can now rest easy. It has been a difficult few years but we have gotten by the grace of God and now we are getting his blessings,&rdquo; remarked Kalekwa. In spite of the cash problems, the 2009 champion produced a stunning last few results to survive relegation in the last match of the campaign.
