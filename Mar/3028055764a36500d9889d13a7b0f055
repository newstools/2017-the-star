Coast regional coordinator Nelson Marwa has blasted Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho for proclaiming he is the region's Sultan.He said they cannot allow residents to go through the trouble experienced when Sultans from the Omani Arab clan ruled the region."Africans went through troubles in the hands of Sultans and you want to call yourself such?" Marwa said on Thursday.He said such a thing cannot be allowed to happen in the country, adding that all counties must be respected."You want to be sultan in Lamu, Tana River, and Voi. What is the agenda? Has Mazrui leadership come back in Africa?" he posed.This was in response to Joho's efforts to rally Coast counties to support the National Super Alliance (NASA) ahead of August 8 polls.A rally that was to be addressed by Governors Joho and Amason Kingi (Kilifi) in Kwale was disrupted by GSU officers on Thursday.NASA, which brings together Raila Odinga (ODM), Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper), Musalia Mudavadi (ANC), and Moses Wetang'ula (Ford-K), is perceived to enjoy popular support at the Coast.Police lobbed teargas at ODM supporters who had turned up for the event on grounds that they had not booked the venue in Kinango.The officers also fired teargas at the area where the governor's helicopter was about to land. Kwale's Salim Mvurya has been blamed for the incident.Msambweni MP Suleiman Dori, Kwale Speaker Sammy Ruwa and MP aspirant Benjamin Tayari were ready to welcome Joho.See: [VIDEO] Joho's Kwale rally aborts after GSU chase supporters, claim no approvalAlso read: Joho drama, anger outbursts show Uhuru cannot be President - OppositionMore on this: Joho must be told the truth, Uhuru says, dismisses anger outburst claimsBut Marwa said: "Tana River, Kwale, Lamu and Taita people must be respected. We should stand up for this country."At a celebration of the Makonde citizenship, Marwa said leaders from the country should play politics within their jurisdictions."If you are in Mombasa, keep your politics in Mombasa. Don&rsquo;t interfere with Lamu, Kwale and other areas," Marwa said.He condemned last week's Mpeketoni incident where an ODM rally was disrupted by a group of youths against Joho.Marwa warned politicians against using youths to disrupt meetings, saying such groups will be dealt with."No law allows locals to bring chaos in forums. Youths surrounding politicians should be careful. We are going to deal with politicians who disrupt peace," he said.He said that some politicians and their 'hooligans' are walking with fake guns, which he noted will be taken away soon.Naomi Joseph was among hundreds of supporters who was hit by a teargas canister during the fracas.Another ODM rally in Lunga Lunga had to be cancelled after locals feared disruptions witnessed in Kinango.Joho accused the Jubilee administration of returning the country to the era of dictatorship by use of police to intimidate dissidents.He told journalists at Swahili beach in Ukunda that it is disheartening for people to be beaten up by police without reason."This should not be allowed in the era of a new constitution. We have been touring the area peacefully," the governor said.Joho said that President Uhuru Kenyatta has proved his threats to teach him a lesson following the disruption of the rally by the police."Police should not be used by Jubilee to disrupt meetings. If they take illegal directives, then they should be ready to face legal repercussions," he said.He said they will do everything possible to ensure Jubilee is defeated 'even if it uses the army in rallies'.Kingi said even if Uhuru and Deputy President William Ruto shift their base to Coast region, they will not get support."We told the police and knew that if they will be there, they will be guarding us. We were surprised that they brought anti-riot police immediately they saw the helicopter," he said."When we followed the OCS and OCPD, they ran away. When we went to the county commissioner&rsquo;s office to get reasons, he was not around," Kingi said.[Statement] 'Sad' Joho condemns repression after Kwale GSU attack
