The National Bank of Kenya has been ordered to pay Sh1 billion to former employees who sued for wrongful termination.Justice Monica Mabru of the Employment and Labour Relations Court said they were discriminated against and unfairly treated when they were sent on voluntary retirement in 2014.&ldquo;To engage an employee on inferior or unfavorable terms and conditions of employment is a practice that cannot find justification in law and in fair labour practices. Such should be frowned upon and not receive the sanction of the court,&rdquo; she said. The 200 former employees, through lawyer Judith Guserwa, said they applied for voluntary early retirement, which was to take effect on April 30, 2014. They said the bank unlawfully and unfairly kept them in employment until May 6, 2014, subjecting them to great anxiety, stress and loss. Mbaru awarded them 10 months&rsquo; salary in compensation.
