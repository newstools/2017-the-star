Mumias East MP Benjamin Washiali has denied media reports he is warming up to ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi and is about to defect.He told the Star on the phone yesterday that some media are spreading propaganda to discredit him.&ldquo;I have never thought of ditching the Jubilee Party to support Mudavadi if he is named NASA flagbearer. I worked with him in 2013 and I know who he is,&rdquo; Washiali said.The Jubilee Party coordinator in Kakamega county said he will run for reelection on the Jubilee ticket.&ldquo;I weighed my options before deciding which party to join. I have made up my mind to support President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto to complete their terms. Nothing will change my decision,&rdquo; he said.Washiali urged the media to be objective and confirm reports from all parties before publishing.&ldquo;I understand the media code of ethics involves reaching out to all parties named in a story. How come some media practitioners run to newsrooms with one-sided stories?&rdquo; he asked.In 2013, Washiali supported Mudavadi&rsquo;s presidential bid and was elected on the UDF ticket, then led by Mudavadi.
