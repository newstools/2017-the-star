A multi-million-shilling security scanner located at one of the strategic gates to Parliament malfunctioned over two months ago, and, despite the machine playing a key check role for visitors coming to the House, it is yet to be repaired. Security personnel manning the gate have had their work more than doubled, ass they literally frisk visitors and staff entering Parliament, prolonging the process of clearance. It is unclear why the machine is yet to be restored, despite an outcry from security personnel who continue to complain of being overwhelmed daily. With some parliamentary staff known to bully the NYS graduates, the security checks have become a nightmare as some staff refuse to be frisked and often shove aside the personnel. With President Uhuru Kenyatta expected to address a joint sitting of the Senate and the National Assembly on Wednesday, it is unclear how security will be handled, given the strategic nature of the machine that scans entrants for security threat gadgets.==================HAS the Jubilee succession plan at the Kenya National Audit Office suffered a setback? Well, sources whisper to Corridors that a senior officer at KENAO, reportedly earmarked by the powerful ruling elite to succeed Edward Ouko, has retired. It is said that the succession plan dragged after a multi-pronged game plan to remove Ouko last year ran into headwinds. Two of the people allegedly involved in the ouster bid in the legislature were named in the Sh1.8 billion NYS rip-off that threw the game plan into disarray. A senior Jubilee leader in Parliament was recently heard celebrating that this time Ouko known for explosive audit reports - may not survive. But is removing a public watchman like Ouko in an election year good for President Uhuru Kenyatta?=================THE fate of some key suspects in the Sh1.8 billion NYS saga could be known soon as the chickens come home to roost. Corridors is aware that the Public Accounts Committee has written to Chief of Staff Joseph Kinyua seeking details of a government circular which allegedly in 2014 gave Cabinet Secretaries extended powers to be directly in charge of their dockets with authority on procurement and management of finances. It is understood that the PAC, chaired by Rarieda MP Nicholas Gumbo, will soon adopt its much-awaited report. Details of the circular are crucial for the committee to make a decision on top ministry of Devolution officials, including former Devolution CS Anne Waiguru and former PS Peter Mang'iti. A member of the powerful and influential committee has confided to Corridors that differences in the panel over whether or nor to bar Waiguru and some key suspects from holding public office are likely to be brought to rest once Kinyua responds. The committee was divided right down the middle over the far-reaching recommendation, prompting the chairman to write to Kinyua for the crucial letter.
