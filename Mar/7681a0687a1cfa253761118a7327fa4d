A National Assembly committee has recommended to the House it set up its own team to oversee devolution, a move that is likely to spark rivalry with the Senate.A report by the Constitutional Implementation Oversight Committee tabled last week requests the House to establish a Select Committee on Devolution to &ldquo;regularly&rdquo; engage governors, state institutions implementing devolution and other stakeholders.The CIOC, chaired by Njoroge Baiya (Githunguri MP), says the Select Committee will end &ldquo;suspicion and conflict&rdquo; between the state and the counties caused by the challenges of managing intergovernmental relations.The Senate is constitutionally mandated to oversee and protect devolution by holding both the county governments and state institutions implementing devolution to account.&ldquo;A parliamentary oversight committee on devolution is, therefore, necessary to check those charged with executing intergovernmental relations and other devolution matters,&rdquo; part of the report reads.The committee held meetings last month over the matter, where it found the current weak institutional and legal framework hurts effective implementation of devolution. &ldquo;The National Assembly has a duty to oversee devolution and ensure the national government and her institutions and the county governments interrelate in a harmonious manner,&rdquo; reads the report.The CIOC involved the Justice and Legal Affairs Committee chaired by Samuel Chepkonga (Ainabkoi MP) in arriving at the recommendations to be approved when MPs resume on March 14.The House departmental committee on Finance, Planning and Trade will be denied its oversight role on devolution.The powers will be given to the proposed Select Committee to taking over the functions of the CIOC when its period expires. The proposed committee will also be tasked with reviewing laws on devolution and intergovernmental relations and addressing gaps in policies.
