Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen has dismissed claims by some Pokot leaders that the state has hired police reservists to attack a certain community.Pokot leaders led by West Pokot Senator John Lonyangapuo have accused the government of recruiting 255 police reservists from one community, saying the reservists were hired to target one community in the banditry-prone Kerio Valley.Murkomen said leaders opposed to the move to enhance security in Kerio Valley were capitalising on the insecurity situation to gain political mileage.&ldquo;I want to ask leaders from both Pokot and Marakwet communities to stop politicising efforts to restore law and order in Kerio Valley,&rdquo; he said.Speaking at Kapsowar African Inland Church, Marakwet West on Sunday, Murkomen said the 255 police reservists were recruited to work with the police to contain bandits attacks, but not to target an entire community.&ldquo;The security operation in Kerio targets criminals who kill women and children. Let us incite poor locals who have been impoverished by the attacks against such an important security decision,&rdquo; he added.Lonyangapuo has recently criticised the increased number of reservists, saying the move was akin to recruiting a militia to fight a rival community.He faulted Deputy President William Ruto&rsquo;s visits to the troubled Baringo and Elgeyo Marakwet in the past two weeks, accusing the DP of sidelining a section of elected leaders during his tours.&ldquo;You can make visits and make decisions affecting communities without involving their elected leaders,&rdquo; he told DP Ruto in February 25.At least 50 people have been killed and thousands of animals stolen in the fights that have rocked Elgeyo Marakwet and Baringo counties since March last year.The conflict has also spread to parts of Laikipia where bandits have invaded ranches and displaced locals.
