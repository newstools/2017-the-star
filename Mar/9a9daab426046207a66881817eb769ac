He said clerks should be posted to regions dominated by people from ethnic groups other than theirs.Midiwo said Rift Valley is among regions with the worst records of massive rigging. &ldquo;We want IEBC staff from Luoland posted to Central and vice versa to ensure the rigging trend is nipped in the bud,&rdquo; he said.Midiwo was speaking during a morning talk show on Radio Mayienga FM yesterday. He said the opposition has credible information some IEBC staff have connived to rig the polls in favour of Jubilee.Midiwo said the opposition will not participate in a pre-rigged election. He said the voter register must be cleaned and the names of more than two million ghost voters who participated in the 2013 election be published as a guarantee of a free, fair and credible election. Midiwo said though efforts to remove the IEBC secretariat failed, they have a way of blocking it from engaging in election malpractices. He said ODM leader Raila Odinga is best suited to be NASA presidential flagbearer.
