The Netherlands Embassy is willing to give technical and financial assistant to farmers to help increase milk yield.The embassy's representative in charge of food security and agriculture Sanne Willems said her country will help the Meru Dairy Union as a way to strengthen its trade with Kenya.&ldquo;The Netherlands has a new policy moving from aid to trade. We are not just giving away money anymore but we are helping develop business between the two countries,&rdquo; she said.Willems spoke on Friday in Meru town after she presented an award to the Meru Dairy Union. The union emerged the best managed cooperative out of the 74 cooperatives supported by The Netherlands Embassy around the world.She said Netherlands produces three times more milk than Kenya, despite being a small country with a population of 16 million and 18,000 producers.&ldquo;There is some progress to be made by Meru Dairy Union. We have seen some cows that produce about 35 litres, so it is possible to raise the number of production per cow from four litres on average to overtake that of Netherlands that is at 45 litres per cow, which is very possible if farmers embrace good feeds, management, the numbers will rise,&rdquo; Willems said.She said they are aiming for 300,000 litres per day.
