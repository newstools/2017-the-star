The Nairobi government needs Sh1.2 billion to rehabilitate street families in the capital.Governor Evans Kidero yesterday said the county, in collaboration with the national government, has sent more than 20,000 street children back to their home counties since November last year.&ldquo;About 4,000 to 5,000 street children that we were unable to trace their homes are in our rehabilitation centres,&rdquo; he said.Kidero said there are about 100,000 children aged between four and 15 in the city who are out of school.He said a large number of them become street children.Speaking at St Mary&rsquo;s Primary Schoool in Karen yesterday, Kidero said there is not enough cash to rehabilitate street families.&ldquo;The funds are limited and we are looking for sponsors who can come forward and support the construction of the more than 4,000 classes needed in Nairobi to accommodate all the children,&rdquo; he said.The county currently has 6,000 classrooms against the required 10,000.Kidero said the county has built 700 classrooms since 2013.The governor accused the Ministry of Education of delaying to respond to his requests to sign a memorandum of understanding to develop school infrastructure.&ldquo;Education was not fully developed, so when I use the county government money to build these classes, the Auditor General will be on my neck,&rdquo; he said.The county is now building a rehabilitation centre on 42 acres in Ruai.City residents have complained about the street children, saying they steal.There is no official number of homeless children in Kenya, but some nongovernmental organisations have put the number at 250,000.
