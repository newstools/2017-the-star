A group of Kamba leaders have said they want to be on the winning team, and that is why their decision to support the Jubilee Party is irreversible.They said they have resolved to back Jubilee so that they become part of the party&rsquo;s owners and not coalition partners.The leaders include MPs Mike Sonko (Nairobi), Victor Munyaka (Machakos Town), Regina Ndambuki (Kilome), Rachel Nyamai (Kitui South), Joe Mutambo (Mwingi Central), Benson Mbai (Masinga), Kisoi Munyao (Mbooni), former legislators Philip Kaloki and Kalembe Ndile, Sports Kenya chairman Fred Muteti and Makueni speaker Stephen Ngelu.The leaders told NASA co-principal Kalonzo Musyoka he has no chance of clinching the alliance&rsquo;s presidential ticket. They said ODM leader Raila Odinga will not allow anyone else to win the ticket. The leaders made the remarks when they met Deputy President William Ruto at his Karen office, Nairobi, on Wednesday. Mutambo dismissed reports Ukambani is an opposition stronghold. He said, &ldquo;More than half of the elected leaders from Ukambani are in Jubilee.&rdquo;Ruto said he was impressed by the leaders&rsquo; decision to unite and woo members of the Kamba community to work with Jubilee for unity and development.
