National Super Alliance brainchild supremo Musalia Mudavadi appears to have most of the fortunes flowing to his side to propel the new coalition into power on August 8.The ANC leader&rsquo;s fortunes apparently started consolidating after the debilitating humiliations of betrayal he suffered at the hands of President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto in the run-up to the last general election.That is when the duo deliberately conspired to dupe him with an agreement to be the Jubilee Coalition flagbearer, only to unceremoniously dump him in a freezing ice-cold political limbo as they hoarded power for themselves and close cronies from their ethnic communities.It was the second time Mudavadi was being consigned to the ice of political limbo in his political career at the very hands of President Kenyatta. The first having been at the 2002 general election, when he was forced to play second fiddle by then President Daniel Moi and coerced to leave the opposition pentagon to become a reluctant last Vice President to Moi and Uhuru&rsquo;s running mate.Twice, he was forced, against his own better judgment, to go back to the drawing board, to pick up and painstakingly piece together the broken icy pieces of his political career that was being threatened with oblivion. Mudavadi seems to have come back with the deadly rage of angels to reclaim and defend the stolen Kingdom of God &mdash; Kenya.Right from the transformation of the Amani coalition outfit in 2013, right after the UhuRuto betrayal, he stood for the presidency on the UDF ticket and lost. He then changed the Amani coalition into the ANC party, and now the recent mooting of the NASA jaggernaugt to hound Jubilee out of power.After the political betrayals and humiliations that the ANC leader has weathered over the last two-and-a-half decades, it is now clearly becoming evident that he has created a powerful and deadly force of vengeance that has come to lead the opposition leaders to hound the Jubilee outfit out of power &mdash; NASA. This is after Jubilee apparently watered itself down on merging into a single huge political party.Comparatively, the NASA principals ODM&rsquo;s Raila Odinga, Wiper&rsquo;s Kalonzo Musyoka, and Ford Kenya&rsquo;s Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula, have never suffered nor experienced the political betrayals and humiliations that their colleague Mudavadi has gone through over the last 25 years.Betrayals and humiliations that saw the ANC leader rejected, reviled, shunned, humiliated and vilified came right from his own home constituency, Sabatia, spread to Vihiga county and those neighbouring it and, in particular, his own populous Luhya community in Western region.This was a community that was supposed to defend and protect him, just as others have done t their own, personalities like President Kenyatta and DP Ruto, former Presidents Moi and Mwai Kibaki, Raila and Kalonzo. But the Luhyas shunned Mudavadi as a coward and even voted him out of office.It was, therefore, a dramatic turn of events when a study conducted by the University of Nairobi found that the peoples of the former Western province preferred Mudavadi against Wetang&rsquo;ula and Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya as their leader and spokesman.However, the turning fortunes which initially exploded into apparently earth-shaking waves, are consistently transforming themselves into a storm that has all the hallmarks of tsunami, which may totally and completely change the country&rsquo;s political future and destiny forever.That is from the narrow stronghold of two ethnic communities &mdash; the Kikuyu of Central and the Kalenjin of the Rift Valley &mdash; against the rest, comprising more than 42 groups, spread across all the the country right from the Kenya&ndash;Uganda border in the West to the East on the Kenya&ndash;Somali border and the Indian Ocean. From the North of the border of Kenya&ndash;Ethiopia/South Sudan to the South on the Kenya&ndash;Tanzania border.Indeed, it is a well documented fact over the decades that have seen the regimes of four presidents the gross and blatant abuse of ill gotten wealth and financial might entrenched in mega corruption cartels used to fraudulently grab power to maintain the status quo of the debilitating extreme poverty amongst tens of millions with only a handful mega rich perennially calling the shots.This is clearly the direct opposite of the hope and salvation that the NASA principals are propagating in a broken society brought to its knees by perennial mega multi-billion shilling corruption scandals in a tattered economy, whose money circulation has been consigned to the dungeons of gross mismanagement and misrule.Evidence of the impending change through the NASA juggernaugt is unfolding everyday and everywhere, as the clock ticks closer to this year&rsquo;s election date. That is starting from the apathy that was recently witnessed in the mass voter registration exercise by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission.The most telling are the statistics released by the electoral commission, which clearly showed that NASA and Jubilee are neck-and-neck, with the total figures of the registered voters in areas perceived to be their strongholds across the country. Jubilee had had seven million just as NASA, with the former leading by a few hundreds of thousands.Not forgetting the fact that the Jubilee administration has entrenched ethnicity in the country&rsquo;s administration and politics more than ever before and since Independence.In the February mass voter registration, President Kenyatta&rsquo;s home Kiambu county listed 106,223 against the targetted 250,493 voters.That is despite the fact that billionaires from the Central Kenya region through the Mount Kenya Foundation coordinated by Mutuma Nkanata had pooled more than Sh500 million to finance the mobilisation of people from Central and Nairobi to register as voters, complete with transport and pocket money for listing . It is also associated with Equity Bank Group founder Peter Munga.That is in total contrast from the rest of the country where that was not in practice. The former Western province counties, with the Luhya community being the second largest population in the country, managed a total of more than 2.3 million. This was in the counties of Kakamega, Bungoma, Busia, Vihiga and Trans Nzoia.It should also not be forgotten that just as the Kikuyus, the Luhyas are also scattered across this country &mdash; in the Rift Valley, Nairobi, Coast, Nyanza and Eastern.Combined, the NASA juggernaugt has the ability to effectively consolidate the Bantu groups that have over the decades been marginalised in Western, Nyanza, Rift Valley, Nairobi, Eastern, and Coast, the sidelined Nilotics and the hermits and Cushites from Northern and Northeastern Kenya to build an all-inclusive nation: To effectively remove Jubilee from power.More evidence of this trouble is emerging with the recent blocking of DP Ruto from entering Bungoma town, where he has made more than 20 forays in the recent past, to address a rally even after Governor Ken Lusaka and a number of MPs and leaders defected to Jubilee.The same DP&rsquo;s hostile reception in Turkana, Pokot, Baringo, the rebellion of Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto and Senator Gideon Moi, the frantic visits to Moi Senior by Kenyatta&rsquo;s mother Mama Ngina Kenyatta, followed by that of President Kenyatta, the public hostilities against him at the Coast led by Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho, the Jubilee defections witnessed in Embu and Meru in the recent past are all just clear indications of a troubled Jubilee.All these are crowned by the more recent raids y the NASA team in the so-called Jubilee strongholds in Eldoret, Narok, Nakuru and, more so Meru, where the receptions were attended by unprecedented huge masses of people. It is, therefore,clearly emerging that the Jubilee structure is this time round a battered and besieged house compared to the run-up the last general election. At that time, they had a powerful emotional rallying call &mdash; that of being suspects at the International Criminal Court in The Hague.However, in this election, their administration is riddled with corruption and fake or uncompleted/failed development projects and programmes. So what is going to be their rallying call to their ethnic sympathisers?Indeed, it has already emerged that of the four NASA principals, Raila, Mudavadi, Kalonzo and Wetang&rsquo;ula, the most feared and dreaded personality to be the coalition&rsquo;s flagbearer amongst the Jubilee ranks is Mudavadi. This is because he has the Tyranny of Numbers from his own community, which has been shunned for decades by the Kikuyu and Kalenjin ruling class.Second, he has an appeal and is easily accepted amongst the Kalenjins and other communities in the Rift Valley, in Central &mdash; because Gema groups are enslaved by the Raila/Luophobia and find Mudavadi more acceptable. With Kalonzo as his running mate Eastern will be a walkover, crowned by Coast, who have historically been close to their Western fellow Bantus.
