ODM yesterday unveiled a 22-day staggered timetable for its primaries, targetting to restore order and instil confidence among supporters.The much-awaited primaries will begin on April 1. The timetable covers at least 26 counties. This is expected to end the issue of bungled nominations, which was blamed for party leader Raila Odinga s failed presidential bid in 2013.In a two-day nominations held on December 4-6, 2013, chaos and violence marred the party s primaries, especially in its traditional Nyanza and Western strongholds.Nominations will take place in at least two counties daily. Turkana and Kakamega nominations will be on the first day. Bungoma and Busia will hold theirs on April 3.Siaya and Trans Nzoia will have theirs on April 5, Mombasa and Samburu on April 7, Migori and Nyamira on April 9, Narok and Kisii on April 11, and Vihiga and Kisumu on April 13.Kilifi and Tana River s will be on April 15 and April 17 will be Kajiado and Taita Taveta s turn.Homa Bay and Lamu will hold primaries on April 19. Kwale, Nakuru and Uasin Gishu s will be on April 21, while Nairobi, Makueni and Garissa will close the chapter on April 22.The NEB is made up of Judith Pareno (chairperson), Ibrahim Rashid, Robert Arunga (secretary), Edward Nyale and Lora Anindo.Pareno said the one day between the nominations dates will give time for logistical support. She said the party will not entertain nonsense from jokers and joyriders with ulterior motives to hurt ODM s image.The NEB has constituted County Election Coordinating Committees and the Constituency Election Panels as its seeks to devolve its mandate to ensure efficiency.This means none of the branch officials will have a hand in the primaries. The nomination certificates will be signed only by Pareno, Arunga and ODM executive director Oduor Ong wen.This is meant to restore confidence and trust among hopefuls and supporters. The board will soon train grassroots election management panels to familiarise them with the nominations rules and procedures.In the 2013 poll, a number of aspirants flew to Orange House and picked certificates without participating in the primaries, which left their rivals disillusioned.Some hopefuls switched to Cord affiliates and went on to win the elections.
