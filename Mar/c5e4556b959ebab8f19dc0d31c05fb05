The African Development Bank has declined to issue a &ldquo;no objection letter&rdquo; allowing Kenya to award a tender to Sinohydro Tianjin Engineering.The tender is for the Sh62.3 billion Thwake Dam project in Ukambani.Water PS Patrick Mwangi defied advice from the bank and other key offices and awarded the contract to a firm, which was the second-lowest bidder.Mwangi ignored advice by Attorney General Githu Muigai, MPs, AfDB, the EACC and Water CS Eugene Wamalwa to award the tender to China Gezhouba, which bid Sh3 billion less than Sinohydro.In a letter to Mwangi, seen by the Star, the bank said that a &ldquo;no objection to award the tender to the lowest bidder cannot be given, since there is no justifiable reason to reject the lowest evaluated bidder.&rdquo; The letter is dated March 28 and was received by the Water ministry on the same day.AfDB also warned the PS that its rules and procedures do not allow it to get into contracts where there may be involvement of &ldquo;fraud and corruption&rdquo;. &ldquo;In such cases, the bank will declare misprocurement and cancel the financing allocated to the goods and works that have been misprocured,&rdquo; AfDB said in the letter.The bank also said all bids, including bid securities for the tender, should &ldquo;remain valid until the procurement is concluded.&rdquo; The project has put Mwangi and Wamalwa at loggerheads, as their differences playout before the National Assembly Agriculture Committee.In his advice to the PS, Githu warned that the project may not take off because AfDB, which is financing 35 per cent of the project, has threatened to divert the funds to another project should procurement controversies remain unresolved.The ministry&rsquo;s Tender Evaluation Committee recommended the contract be awarded to China Gezhouba, which bid Sh36.9 billion bid.It disqualified Sinohydro, whose bid for the project&rsquo;s phase one stood at Sh39.5 billion.It has also emerged that Sinohydro was on June 28 last year blacklisted by the World Bank for one year on suspicion of bribing officials in countries not identified.&ldquo;The Sanctions Board found that it was more likely than not that the respondent had recklessly misrepresented commissions paid or to be paid to an agent in order to influence the procurement process for a World Bank-financed contract,&rdquo; James Spinner, chairperson of the World Bank Group Sanctions Board, wrote to Sinohydro on June 29 last year.
