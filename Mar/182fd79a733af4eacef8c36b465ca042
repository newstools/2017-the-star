Former Devolution CS Anne Waiguru’s running mate Peter Ndambiri has alleged their opponents are paying NASA legislators so they can recommend Waiguru be barred from running for Kirinyaga governor. Ndambiri spoke to the press on Wednesday during an aspirants’ meeting. He said their opponents met ODM members to fix Waiguru using the PAC report on the probe of the Sh1.8 billion NYS scandal, yet no evidence links her to the loss of money when she was CS.
