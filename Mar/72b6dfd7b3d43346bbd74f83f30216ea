Six ODM legislators on Monday backed Suba MP John Mbadi’s reelection for a third term. They said he has been a staunch supporter and defender of party leader Raila Odinga, and he deserves another term to strengthen the party when Raila wins the presidency. “I want to request the people of Suba to give our national chairman another term as we need him in the next Parliament after Baba [Raila] has clinched the presidency,” nominated MP Oburu Oginga said. The six spoke at Magunga shopping centre, where Mbadi launched his reelection bid. Mbadi said he needs another term to fulfil his promises to the people. He said he will run for Homa Bay governor in 2022. Present were Homa Bay woman representative Gladys Wanga, Uriri MP John Kobado, Homa Bay Senator Moses Kajwang, Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi and Kabondo Kasipul MP Sylvance Osele. The ODM primaries will be held next month. Mbadi will face former Raila aide Caroli Omondi in the race for the ODM ticket. Omondi lost to Mbadi in the 2013 primaries. Osele accused Omondi of not paying party agents in the March 4, 2013, election, which he said might have contributed to Raila’s loss. He said Omondi cannot, therefore, be entrusted with the constituency’s leadership. Omondi has denied this claim many times. Last month he asked ODM agents who claim they were shortchanged to come forward. “People say I made Raila lose the presidency because I didn’t pay agents. I can confirm here that’s not true. I had instructions to pay only ODM agents but not those of individual candidates,” he said. “Let any agent whose name was forwarded to me by the party, to whom I refused to give money, come up. I stand to be challenged.” Wanga, who is the branch chairperson, has always said she will not declare support for any aspirant, but will work with the elected leader.
