KANU has attracted more than 2,500 aspirants seeking various political seats in the Rift Valley, a Jubilee stronghold.The hopefuls have declared interest to run for governor, senator, parliamentary and MCA seats, a development that could give Jubilee a run for its money in Deputy President William Ruto's backyard.Ruto and Baringo Senator Gideon Moi have been engaged in a supremacy battle over control of politics in the region. Although Kanu said it will support President Uhuru Kenyatta's reelection, the party will field candidates for other seats.&ldquo;We have received overwhelming interest from aspirants, and members will soon decide on how best we will pick our strong candidates to vie for various seats," Kanu secretary general Nick Salat said.He said the high number of aspirants seeking the party's ticket is a sign of its popularity countrywide. Paul Kibet of Elgeyo Marakwet, a Kanu official, said many hopefuls in the North Rift have already hit the ground campaigning as they wait for nominations. &ldquo;Unlike the last elections, this time Kanu has a very high number of aspirants and we are just waiting for the party to indicate how we will go about our nominations,&rdquo; Kibet said.The party has the highest number of aspirants in Baringo, Elgeyo Marakwet and Pokot.Last month, Gideon said former Inspector General of Police David Kimaiyo will vie for the Elgeyo Marakwet Senate seat on Kanu ticket. He is expected to give Jubilee tough competition. Kibet said the party will soon unveil its aspirant for the governor post.In Pokot, Kanu will field Senator John Lonyangapuo for the governor seat to battle it out with Governor Simon Kachapin who was elected through Kanu but defected to Jubilee early this year.The party will also field aspirants for all other seats in the region. Gideon will be defending his seat in Baringo as Senator but he is planning to campaign for Kanu&rsquo;s aspirants in all regions. The competition between Kanu and Jubilee aspirants is expected to reignite rivalry between Gideon and Ruto ahead of the August 8th polls.Gideon has also hinted that he may vie for presidency in 2022 at the same time when Ruto is expected to be the Jubilee presidential aspirant.
