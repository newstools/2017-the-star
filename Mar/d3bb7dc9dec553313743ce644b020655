The Federal Party of Kenya will support a NASA presidential candidate, but it will field candidates in all other elective seats, new party leader Andrew Kutitila has said. On Saturday, the Sikhendu MCA said the party will work with the opposition to consolidate Western and Trans Nzoia votes against the Jubilee Party. The Federal Party cannot support JP because the government has subjected Kenyans to more problems than before, Kutitila said. &ldquo;Kenyans are now suffering more than before. The prices of basic needs such as flour, kerosene and even electricity bills have gone up. This is unacceptable,&rdquo; he said.Kutitila said registration for party aspirants and membership is ongoing and encouraged young people and people living with disability to join the party and pay half the nomination fee. The MCA has taken over the party from former Lugari MP Cyrus Jirongo. His name as the party leader was gazetted last week and he will take the oath of office on Saturday at Kitale Stadium. NASA leaders have been invited for the event.
