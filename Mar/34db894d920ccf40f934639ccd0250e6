The Nzoia Sugar Company is experiencing shortage of sugar, a problem that has made the company move to various farms in search of cane.Speaking to journalists on Tuesday at the company&rsquo;s guest house, acting managing director Michael Kulundu said the problem is caused by the drought. &ldquo;We are forced to move to parts of Iteso North in Busia and neighbouring counties in search of sugarcane,&rdquo; he said. Kulundu said the company has put in place measures to ensure farmers are paid after two weeks upon cane delivery.&ldquo;We know the major problem affecting our farmers is a need for fertiliser and prompt pay,&rdquo; Kulundu said.He said the company wants farmers to depend on cane farming and benefit from sales.Kulundu said fertiliser will soon be distributed to farmers.He said the company will also have experts visit farmers and give them tips on how best to plant cane.Farmers&rsquo; secretary general Macdonald Wamocho asked politicians not to politicise factory operations. He warned them against inciting farmers against the management, sayingit has done a lot to improve the factory.&ldquo;We do not want to see politicians use the Nzoia Company to gain mileage during political rallies,&rdquo; he said.Wamocho accused politicians of using Nzoia as a campaign platform during campaigns. He said Nzoia is a tribal-free company that has employed people from all parts of the country. &ldquo;Everyone is entitled to serve here without being discriminated against on ethnic lines,&rdquo; Wamocho said.
