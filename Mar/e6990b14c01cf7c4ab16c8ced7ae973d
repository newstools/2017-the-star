Knut secretary general Wilson Sossion has said the Teachers Service Commission s report on Alliance High School bullying is a fabrication targeted at retired principal David Kariuki. This whole saga borders on vendetta directed at the school s principal, who has a sterling record, he said.Media reports say a form one student was beaten and injured by prefects in a tradition sanctioned by the school administration.Speaking in Kitengela, Sossion said the student who claimed to have been bullied is not a form one, but a 19-year-old form four student who has a history of indiscipline. He said the student sneaked out of school with soiled clothes and took them to the Education ministry offices on February 17.
