Embu Governor Martin Wambora&rsquo;s former personal assistant Bosco Kiura, who has sued his former boss, has said he has nothing against the county chief.&ldquo;I hold the governor in high esteem, but have to fight for my rights,&rdquo; he said yesterday.Kiura and Wambora&rsquo;s political advisers Joshua Kanake and Joe Kamaria have sued Wambora for wrongful dismisal. They want to be reinstated and paid salary arrears for their time out of office.The court instructed the governor to pay the trio their salary arrears since September last year, when he sacked them, pending determination of the case.Wambora defied the order by Justice Monicah Mbaru, leading to the issuing of a warrant of arrest against him on January 30.Kiura said he had hoped the situation would not get out of hand. &ldquo;The governor is like my father. They are of the same age. I had a cordial relationship with the governor. All I want is for him to pay us our dues. I have no vendetta against him,&rdquo; he said.Kiura will run for MCA against assembly speaker Ibrahim Swaleh. He accused Swaleh, who twice sponsored a vote of no confidence against Wambora in 2014, of offering poor leadership. Kiura urged residents to vote for him.
