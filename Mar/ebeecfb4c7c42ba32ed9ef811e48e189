The government wants to tighten the noose on all convicted hatemongers &mdash; politicians, journalists, bloggers &mdash; by sending them to jail for five years, fining them Sh5 million, or both.Politicians convicted of hate speech would be barred from seeking office for five years.The polls are on August 8.If approved by Parliament, The National Integration and Cohesion (Amendment) Bill 2017 will also fine media practitioners as much as Sh10 million if found guilty of publishing and disseminating hate speech.Under the current law, the NCIC Act of 2008, convicts are liable to a Sh1 million fine, three years' imprisonment or both.Comment: New hate speech penalties are likely to be inconsequentialConvicted bloggers, who originate hateful information, would be fined as much as Sh10 million.No hate monger, convicted or otherwise, is currently barred from election.Kenyan trials take so long that anyone charged before the August polls will almost certainly not be convicted or acquitted before the balloting. They can obtain a certificate of good conduct, if not good character, and run for office.The existing law is so vague that many people evade punishment. This Bill defines hate speech as, among other things, "the use of threatening, abusive, insulting, vilifying words or behaviour as well as the displays of any written material or dissemination of any ideas based on ethnic superiority or inferiority".In a bid to stem hate-mongering on the internet, the Bill was proposed by Jubilee's Justice and Legal Affairs Committee Chairman Samuel Chepkonga.The bill is set for the first debate. It could be voted on in May, or it could be delayed.For the first time, the government is trying to legislate the use of vibrant social media, targeting Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp lovers with a penalty of as much as Sh5 million if someone is found guilty of spreading and sharing hate messages.These are the government's first such proposals to rein in hate offenders.&ldquo;Any person convicted of an offence under this section shall not be eligible to hold any public, political or elective office for a period of five years from the date of conviction,&rdquo; the Bill states.&ldquo;A newspaper, radio station, television station, website administrator or other media enterprise that publishes or otherwise disseminates any of the acts under subsection (1) commits an offence and shall, on conviction, be liable to a fine not exceeding Sh10 million.&rdquo;Getting tough sounds good, however, Dr Elias Mokua who teaches communication at the University of Nairobi, termed the law &ldquo;unnecessary and too punitive. It will not achieve much in the long term and may only create dissent."He told the Star such laws previously have been applied selectively and could be used to target critics of the state.&ldquo;We all don't want hate speech, for sure, we want peaceful election. Nobody wants to lose his life or properties or to have IDPs but at the same time, you can't be so punitive,&rdquo; said.&ldquo;These laws are selectively being enforced because there are many people with serious cases and they are walking scot-free. You can't just target the small man or woman in a news media with Sh10 million. In their entire life they may never have earned that much, even if the organisation is to pay.&rdquo;Top politicians allied to President Uhuru Kenyatta and opposition chief Raila Odinga are facing hate speech charges. If Kenyan justice moves swiftly, they could be the first casualties of the law.They include MPs Kimani Ngunjiri (JP Bahati),Timothy Bosire (ODM, Kitutu Masaba), Junet Mohamed (ODM, Suna East) as well as woman representatives Florence Mutua (ODM Busia) and Aisha Jumwa (ODM Kilifi).Jubilee's Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria and his Kabete counterpart Ferdinand Waititu were acquitted of hate speech charges on February 20 for lack of evidence.Director of Public Prosecutions Keriako Tobiko said he would appeal.The Bill would also significantly increase the penalty for convicted hate mongers.They would pay a fine not exceeding Sh5million or five years behind bars, or both.Under the current law, the NCIC Act of 2008, convicts can be fined as much as Sh1 million, imprisoned for three years or both.The Bill provides a more precise and comprehensive definition of hate speech, broadening the work of Francis Ole Kaparo's National Cohesion and Integration Commission.For instance, the use of coded language, acts or gestures could be construed as hate speech.Hate speech would include presenting or directing public performance of a play with gestures depicting ethnic hatred.It covers distributing, showing or playing a recording that contains ethnic propaganda or stereotyping, or contains gestures depicting ethnic hatred.For the first time, the definition of hate speech will also cover incitement of violence towards a person or group of persons or towards property of that person or group of persons.NCIC bosses have often complained the current definition of hate speech is too narrow. It was enacted after the 2007-08 post-election violence.Consequently, many hate offenders have walked free, despite creating a firestorm and escalating antagonism.On June 13 last year, Moses Kuria appeared to call for assassination of opposition leader Raila Odinga. He was acquitted. Other charges are pending.NCIC recently recruited social media investigators and acquired voice recorders and cameras across in all 47 counties.The devices will be used to monitor politicians, especially during rallies.But Bill also takes away powers to nominate NCIC commissioners from Parliament and gives them to the Public Service Commission, an arm of government.
