The UN has partnered with the national and county governments and NGOs to donate rehabilitation drugs to 5,000 Kwale addicts.Recovering addicts will undergo a two-year treatment programme at the Teens Watch Centre. On Wednesday, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime delivered two containers for storage of the methadone detox drug at Kombani health centre.Methadone reduces addiction to heroin and reduces the effects of withdrawal symptoms.County rehabilitation programmes director Fatma Hajj urged residents to support the initiative. &ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t protect youths, the nation will lose a lot of people with potential,&rdquo; she said.Hajj said the county will help the recovering addicts start businesses and get jobs.Teens Watch Centre director Cosmas Maina said 600 addicts will be enrolled in the pilot programme in two weeks.He urged the county government to provide transportation to the centre, especially for addicts who live in Ukunda and Msambweni.Maina said drug barons should be prosecuted, otherwise the county will only be treating symptoms.County outreach centre official Mwazewe Mwinyihaji urged residents to refer addicts to the rehabilitation site.Policeman Ali Bakari - suspended for drug abuse - said he is ready to go for rehabilitation and return to work.&ldquo;I have been a drug addict for 15 years and I&rsquo;m very happy methadone has been provided,&rdquo; he said.Bakari urged the government to provide transportation to poor addicts.Ahmed Said, who has been off drugs for nine years, said he is optimistic the methadone will be distributed fairly and will help addicts rehabilitate.&ldquo;It is a relief for us, because some addicts have been lynched by the public when found stealing petty items for their upkeep. The drug will help end this trend,&rdquo; he said.Said said addicts will be able to make sober choices when voting after undergoing rehabilitation. Methadone was previously only available in private facilities. A daily dose costs between Sh10,000 and Sh20,000 per day, which few addicts can afford.
