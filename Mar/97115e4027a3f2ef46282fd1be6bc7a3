Seven suspected terrorists were arrested in a house raid by ATPU officers in Malindi town's Shella area on Friday night.Police blocked all roads leading in and out of Shella, and those around the house behind old law courts, in the 9pm operation.The raid was carried out by heavily armed police officers who were either uniformed or in plain clothes.Among those arrested were a man, his wife, their three daughters and their female cousin. The seventh suspect, their relative, was apprehended about 300 metres from the house.The officers combed the area and then stormed into the house with torches and ordered everyone to lie down.The suspects' relative, a 13-year old boy, took journalists around the house the following day; clothes and documents were found scattered all over the rooms.The boy's sister cried as he told journalists of the ordeal. We were in the sitting room upstairs with my brothers, sisters, mother and father when we heard a loud bang at the gate. We met flash lights and guns when we went downstairs, he said.He said the officers ordered everyone to lie on the ground and asked his father to identify himself.The minor said one of the policemen went to where they were lying and told them not to worry as they were looking for "something small".He said they were promised that their parents would return after a short while but that they did not. We did not sleep the whole night hoping to see our parents and other relatives but nothing has happened, he said.An 80-year old woman found in the living room was reportedly roughed up and ordered to surrender all her documents including passports.Hadija Swaleh was later asked to join the other suspects who were lying on the ground outside.Swaleh, who has three grandchildren, said the agents shot in the air upon arrival and demanded to know who she was and who she was staying with. I was beaten when I tried standing up after hearing someone crying upstairs, she said, adding the officers harassed her and did not let her speak.She was later taken to hospital.Fatma Swaleh said they were afraid because they were "subjected to torture" and that the children witnessed the whole operation.Malindi police chief Matawa Muchangi said they would compile a report and issue a statement.
