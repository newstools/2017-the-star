More than 10 people were injured and several vehicles smashed with stones after armed groups of boda boda riders yesterday clashed in Eldoret disrupting business downtown.For about an hour, the groups, armed with rungus, stones and other crude weapons, took over some of the streets and turned them into battlefields as they engaged each other in running battles.Riot police took more than an hour to intervene. They used teargas to disperse the riders after getting an order from Uasin Gishu county commissioner Abdi Hassan. Three of the injured youths were take to hospital.Sporadic fights started a week ago when some political leaders ferried boda boda riders from rural parts of the county to do their trade in the town centre.&ldquo;We&rsquo;re investigating what has been happening. Whoever is involved in inciting the youth will be arrested and charged,&rdquo; Hassan said, adding that he requested the county government to stop movement of rural boda boda riders to the town.He said the government will not allow lawlessness in the town. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve asked police to act firmly and deal with all those involved,&rdquo; Hassan said.Huruma MCA Peter Chomba said some politicians have been instigating clashes between the boda boda youths based on tribal groupings so they can control the boda boda business.&ldquo;We have on several occasions requested the national government to intervene, but it is overlooking this issue. It may explode further as we approach the election,&rdquo; he said.Chomba accused an aide to a top county official of leading the attacks on those described as &ldquo;outsiders&rdquo;.The cars caught up in the fights were stoned near the Fims garage along Kenyatta Street. On Tuesday, two riders were stabbed at the bus park, where a group of riders stormed to eject another group. Governor hopefuls have been blamed.
