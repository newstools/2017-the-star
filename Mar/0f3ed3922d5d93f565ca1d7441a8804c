Do not interfere in ODM primaries to avoid voter apathy, Alego-Usonga MP Omondi Muluan (pictured) has urged opposition leader Raila Odinga.He said this would guarantee 100 per cent voter turnout on August 8.Muluan said there was high voter apathy in the March 4, 2013, general election because voters were unhappy with the party&rsquo;s National Elections Board&rsquo;s interference in nominations.&ldquo;I was forced to use the Wiper ticket as a vehicle to Parliament following the skewed nominations,&rdquo; he said. Muluan has announced he will defend his seat on the ODM ticket. He spoke on Saturday when he presented a CDF cheque for Sh1.7 million for construction of a dorm at Sirinde Mixed Secondary School.
