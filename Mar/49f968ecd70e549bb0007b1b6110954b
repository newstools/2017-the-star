Doctors and the Health ministry have reached an agreement to ensure that their strike ends today - it's 100th day.The health workers downed their tools on December 5 last year over a CBA signed in 2013 for higher pay and improved working conditions.Lawyers representing doctors and the ministry told Appeals court judges on Tuesday that they would file a joint return-to-work formula by midday."A joint return-to-work formula is being concluded and the strike will end before the end of the day. It's a day of celebration. I confirm the State Law Office position," CoG lawyer Eunice Lumala said.The three-judge bench led by Justice Martha Koome directed that the parties file the consent document when ready. They are to return to court by 1pm.The Court of Appeal on Monday said it will not mediate negotiations to end the doctors' strike if parties do not reach an amicable solution by today.Doctors union officials, through their lawyer James Orengo, had presented their return-to-work formula to the Council of Governors.Lumala said at the time that they needed time to go through the document before making a decision.Koome asked parties &ndash; doctors, the ministry and church leaders &ndash; to deliberate and agree on contentious issues and a return-to-work formula.The decision came after lawyers representing the government, Council of Governors and doctors failed to agree on whether the court should convene next Monday to give directions on the CBA and the return-to-work formula.Read: Mediators in doctors' strike to table report before Court of Appeal today
