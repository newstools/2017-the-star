Jubilee unity in Kakamega is threatened by feuding between former TNA and UDF members.President Uhuru Kenyatta abruptly cancelled his visit this week, citing IEBC nominations timetable.The discord erupts at a time JP is trying to make inroads in Western.Uhuru&rsquo;s TNA and Deputy President William Ruto&rsquo;s UDF dissolved and folded into JP but it hasn&rsquo;t been a happy marriage among the dozen or so former JP affiliates.Former TNA members in Kakamega claim they have been short-changed by those who formerly identified with UDF, led by Mumias East MP Ben Washiali.Former TNA county coordinator Khatete Mumia yesterday said he was short-changed by Washiali after his appointment as JP county coordinator early this month and wants justice.&ldquo;I applied for the job advertised by the party. I was called for an interview in January and invited after an induction two weeks ago,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Before I settled in office, Washiali forced [Raphael] Welimo&rsquo;s appointment because he was a UDF member like him. I feel disheartened by his action.&rdquo;Welimo on Saturday said he was appointed substantive Jubilee county coordinator through an official communication from the party headquarters in Nairobi a week ago.A party source told the Star a group of youths was planning to meet President Uhuru with placards demanding Washiali&rsquo;s removal as the Jubilee point man in the county.&ldquo;The youths complained Washiali pushed former TNA county chairman Desmond Shinaka out and now wants to kill Mumia&rsquo;s aspirations,&rdquo; the source said.Uhuru and Deputy President Ruto were to visit Western region for three days, starting Thursday or Friday. But the tour was cancelled.This comes a day after State House cancelled another tour of Meru and Tharaka Nithi counties.Despite the wrangles, Western Jubilee regional coordinator Mwongo Chimwaga said his office was ready to welcome the President.State House yesterday said new dates for the tour will be announced in the coming days.The visit will involved commissioning and inspection of national government projects.&ldquo;This is the last week provided by the IEBC for political parties to submit their nominations list,&rdquo; State House spokesperson Manoah Esipisu said.&ldquo;President Kenyatta wants aspirants to focus on this important democratic process.&rdquo;The President was last in Western in December, when he commissioned Rai Paper, formerly Webuye Pan Paper Mills. He also commissioned tarmacking of the Ibokolo-Shianda and Lurambi-Nambacha-Musikoma roads.Work is yet to start on both.In Meru and Tharaki Nithi, Jubilee administration has been accused of failing to deliver on its promises.
