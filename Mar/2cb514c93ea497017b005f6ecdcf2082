A family in Angorom ward, Teso South, is living in agony after being isolated by the community because of jigger infestation.Justin Akachong&rsquo;i, 35, a mother of eight, on Wednesday told journalists the worsening condition has affected all her children and that they have been chased away from two primary schools.Her husband Lawrence Omerekek, 43, is also infested. &ldquo;My children can barely walk or sit as most of their toes have been eaten up. What is left of the flesh is mere skin covered with pus and dead cells,&rdquo; She said amid sobs.The children previously went to Angorom Primary School but were chased away.They were transferred to Alupe Primary School in Uganda, where they were also chased away.The eight children aged between 19 and two can barely walk. The social isolation and stigma have caused pain and low self-esteem.Residents in about 30 poverty-stricken homes in the village are infested with the burrowing bug. Secondary infections and disease can be fatal.Many people rarely bathe or wash their feet for lack of water.Omuse Foundation is helping families infested by the fleas.Health worker Christine Apadet said the problems are poor hygiene, ignorance among those affected and lack of medication.She said most infected people chase health workers away, saying the medicine is poisonous.&ldquo;The ridicule and the stigmatisation face from other villagers makes them hide in their huts rather than seek treatment,&rdquo; she said.
