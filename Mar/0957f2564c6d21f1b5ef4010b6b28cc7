Pep Guardiola appears to have ruled out the possibility of Joe Hart playing for Manchester City again.Hart was sent out on loan to Torino last summer but will still have two years left on his &pound;120,000 (Sh15m)-a-week contract when his stint in Italy finishes at the end of this season.With neither Claudio Bravo nor Willy Caballero staking a strong claim for the position, Guardiola was asked if his view on Hart has changed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so happy with Willy and Claudio,&rdquo; said the City boss, which suggests that 29-year-old Hart&rsquo;s 10-year career at City is over, and is bound to alert their Premier League rivals.Like Hart, Caballero is facing an uncertain future, with Guardiola happy to let the Argentine&rsquo;s contract run down until the end of the season before deciding on whether to offer him a new one.&ldquo;There are five, six players out of contract but they know the situation,&rdquo; added Guardiola, who wants to add a target man to his squad next season, with Swansea&rsquo;s Fernando Llorente an early contender.City strikers Sergio Aguero, Gabriel Jesus and Kelechi Iheanacho are similar in stature and Guardiola wants the option of a different approach next season.At 6ft 4in, Llorente, 32, has the physical attributes Guardiola is looking for and the Spaniard has scored nine goals in his first season in the Premier League.Guardiola will not abandon his patient passing style but he has acknowledged that his team would benefit from having a Plan B next season.
