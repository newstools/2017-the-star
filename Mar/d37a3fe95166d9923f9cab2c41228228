The government has refuted claims of using its agencies to intimidate Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho.Joho has accused President Uhuru Kenyatta of harassing him through state agencies such as Knec and KRA.In his latest war with state agencies, the Governor recorded a statement at the DCI on claims that he forged his KCSE certificate to secure admission to University of Nairobi.Read: DCI summons Joho to record statement over forged exam slip claimsBut government spokesman Eric Kiraithe said the accusations were "false and in bad faith"."The government's agenda is to clean the education system of academic fraudsters. We will continue with the full support of all departments as a part of entrenching justice and fairness," he said in a statement on Wednesday.Kiraithe also said Kenyans had an obligation to pay taxes and "no person shall be exempted regardless of perceived status in life".Joho last week dared Uhuru to investigate him after the Kenya Revenue Authority demanded his bank account details.Days later, KRA directed Stanbic Bank to freeze Joho's six bank accounts. In the letter dated March 20, KRA said the accounts should be frozen for 10 days or until the court makes a determination of the order.
