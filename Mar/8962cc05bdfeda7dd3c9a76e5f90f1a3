The Education, Interior and Health ministries will work together to implement the Unique Personal Identifier that will replace the Index number for students.The code was set to roll out on March 10, with candidates who had registered for the national examination being the first to be targeted.In February, the Education CS said the UPI would be used in facilitating financial management of schools.However, the UPI will also help in monitoring health and intelligence of students.This will be important as most students, mostly in primary and secondary school, do not have a national ID to identify them.Speaking at Anglican Church of Kenya Principals Symposium for ACK-owned schools, Education CS Fred Matiang'i said the UPI will be a game-changer in managing student affairs.&ldquo;This new system will be the single source of truthful data that will guide in planning of student affairs and disbursement of education capitation,&rdquo; he said&ldquo;This unique personal identifier will be a six-character number that is officially recognised and will be used to monitor the students in all aspects, apart from disbursement of education capitation.&rdquo;Matiang'i said the students' data would be used to help shape the education system.&ldquo;In an effort to ensure all learners are adequately supported, the Ministry of Education is in the process of developing a comprehensive Education Data Management Information System that gives accurate and reliable data,&rdquo; he said.The CS said the government has received budget support from the World Bank in form of a loan towards Secondary Education Quality improvement in some targeted public secondary schools.&ldquo;The project development aims at achieving enhanced transition, retention, completion, learning environments that are child friendly, school-based teacher support systems using appropriate ICT to upgrade teacher competences in subject knowledge and pedagogical skills for English, Math and Sciences,&rdquo; Matiang'i said.
