Self-listed Nairobi Securities Exchange has proposed to cut dividend payout as much as 44.90 per cent after full-year profit for 2016 dropped by 39.82 per cent.Shareholders on NSE books by May 26 will as a result get Sh0.27 dividend per unit in July from Sh0.49 a year earlier subject to approval at an annual general meeting set for May 26.NSE profit after taxation for 12 months through December 2016 , audited financial performance statement showed late Thursday, fell to Sh183.96 million from Sh305.69 million in 2015.&ldquo;The above results not withstanding, the directors recommend to increase the dividend payout ratio by 8.5 per cent to 40 per cent [compared with 31.5 per cent] and hence the payment of a first and final dividend for the year 2016 of Sh0.27 per ordinary share [compared with Sh 0.49] per ordinary share,&rdquo; NSE said in a statement.The drop in net earnings was expected following a dip in trading activities on the bourse which account for about 53 per cent of revenue streams on the Nairobi bourse. NSE had issued a profit warning on November 23, blaming &ldquo;challenging operating environment both locally and internationally&rdquo;. Local challenges included erosion of share values at the NSE due to sell-off, which was exacerbated by interest rate cap law in September which saw investors exit banking stocks because of expected reduction in profit margins, NSE CEO Geoffrey Odundo said on November 23. Before the rate cap, banks accounted for 42 of market value of the NSE.Investor sentiment in 2016 was also hit by the June 23 successful referendum vote by Britain to exit the 28-member European Union block, and the shock election of billionaire businessman Donald Trump as US president earlier on November 8.NSE said its revenue in 2016 fell by 20.60 per cent to Sh527.16 million for the period ended December 31 from Sh663.90 million it posted 12 months earlier. The company attributed the decline to a 15 per cent reduction in equity trading volumes, which contracted to Sh5.8 billion from Sh6.8 billion the year before.&ldquo;The company remains committed to ensuring shareholder value through continuous product innovation and technology enhancements,&rdquo; the company said in its outlook for 2017. &ldquo;In the course of the year, we will broaden our product offerings through introduction of products geared towards matching the needs of our investors such as Exchange Traded Funds, derivatives contracts and global depository receipts.&rdquo;The NSE said it was banking on &ldquo;enhanced legislative environment geared towards increasing liquidity which has seen the introduction of a market making framework and securities lending and borrowing regulations&rdquo;. The regulations are expected to be effected in the course of the year.
