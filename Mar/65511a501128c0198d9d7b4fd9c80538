The Communications Authority of Kenya has warned media houses intending to conduct a parallel transmission of the August 8 general election results.Director general Francis Wangusi yesterday said CAK will not allow such a thing to happen as it would likely trigger violence, as in 2007-08.Speaking at the launch of the Media Council of Kenya's election reporting guidelines, he said the authority will ensure no media house is involved in transmission of results.Wangusi said only the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission is mandated to announce election results."Some media houses have threatened to transmit their parallel results, but let them have this message clear that we are the watchdogs and we shall not allow it. There is only one body that can transmit election results, and that is the IEBC," he said.Wangusi said the authority will monitor all licensed television stations to ensure they adhere to the programing codes and guidelines to provide equitable coverage to all political rallies."In this regard, we specifically refer to the presidential candidates. Our guidelines are clear that media houses must provide equal coverage to each one of them," he said.Wangusi said CAK will also monitor TV's to ensure they stick to the themes they were licensed for.We have licensed more than 60 TV stations, which are active. At this election period, they tend to throw away the themes they were licensed for and focus on elections. We are not going to allow these platforms to be used by people the way they want to," he said.But MCK chairman Charles Kerich said providing equal coverage to all political rallies is practically impossible.He said CAK should rather let individual media houses make their own judgment on what they think is news to them for coverage.Kerich said it is the public broadcaster being financed by the taxpayers' money that has the capacity to provide an equal coverage to all politicians.&ldquo;Though this law has been passed, I wonder how CAK will practically make it applicable. Individual media houses make their own decisions on what rally to cover, where and when, so a directive of equitable coverage may not just apply," he said.Kerich said some candidates have registered parties, but are dormant."Just imagine media houses calling some clueless politicians to ask now that their competitors said this and that, what are they saying to receive an equal coverage," he said.Kerich said the media should not be blamed for the 2007-08 post-election violence.
