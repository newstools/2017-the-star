Former ODM national youth leader Rashid Mohamed on Monday was endorsed by Wanga elders to run for Mumias West MP. The elders from Mumias Central, Nucleus, Etenje and Musanda wards converged in Ekambara village, Lureko, for the blessing ceremony. Rashid is contesting on the JP ticket. The seat is held by Johnson Naicca of ODM. Other hopefuls are Festo Fadamula (ANC), former Moco CEO Oddah Owakwabi (ODM) and Engineer Mohamed Mukhwana (ANC). The elders said they opted for youthful leadership because their fellow old man deserted them after he was elected in 2013. “Besides, we’ve been watching keenly the movement and conduct of all the aspirants. We’re are convinced Rashid has the capacity to move Mumias West forward.”
