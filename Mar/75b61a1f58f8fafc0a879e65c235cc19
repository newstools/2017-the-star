An investor yesterday evicted 31 families from his 300 acres in Ngelani village, Athi River, Machakos county, even as the squatters claimed they were not served with a notice.The families, mainly elderly men and women and their grandchildren, said they have lived on the land since 1996.&ldquo;We have lost everything &ndash; all our houses, cattle, sheep, goats and crops were destroyed during the evictions,&rdquo; Joseph Muia said.The squatters walked several kilometres to seek redress from deputy county commissioner Geoffrey Omoding at his office in Athi River town.But Omoding said the evictions were conducted following a court order and the victims' leaders were issued with notices in January. He added that the leaders may not have communicated on the eviction notice.&ldquo;Athi River police executed a court order. The officers offered security to people hired by the investor to conduct the evictions early in the morning,&rdquo; Omoding said.But the squatters said they were not given notice and demanded compensation for their destroyed property.Omoding told them to pursue their cases in court.&ldquo;The Constitution gives the complainants the right to appeal,&rdquo; he said.The deputy county commissioner said courts should ensure justice to all in spite of the social status.&ldquo;Let us serve with humanity. These squatters are human, hence need to be heard. They are genuinely vulnerable,&rdquo; Omoding said.He said the victims had formed and registered Village D Self Help Group and elected leaders to help them agitate for their rights.Omoding said they should have been psychologically prepared and given adequate time before being evicted.He urged residents to shun the culture of squatting on people&rsquo;s land to avoid conflicts and loss of property.
