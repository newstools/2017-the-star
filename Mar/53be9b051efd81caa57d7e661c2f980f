An ODM rally in Kwale aborted on Thursday after GSU officers chased supporters away and lobbed tear gas canisters.Party leaders led by Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho were just about to land at the venue in Kinango town.Supporter Juma Omar claimed the officers arrived in three Land Rovers and used loud speakers to warn them against being at the venue.&ldquo;They clobbered us making most of us scamper for safety. Some of us have been slightly injured while others have gone to wash the tear gas effect off their faces,&rdquo; he said.Politicians who were already at the venue helped contain the situation. Joho and his Kilifi counterpart Amason Kingi arrived about five minutes after the chaos.The Governor's personal assistant Idris Abdirahman said police told them the meeting had not been authorised and that the ground was to be used for a public baraza.The supporters went to Kinango market but there were reports that the ODM team would proceed to Mswambweni - their next stop - after recording statements with police.Ben Tayari, ODM's Kinango MP aspirant, said he took the notification to police on Friday and that they acknowledged receiving it.&ldquo;We were in the final stages of preparations. Some supporters had already settled when the officers descended on us. They used their sirens to scare us from the venue,&rdquo; he said.But Kinango OCPD Lawrence Charo insisted that the venue had been booked for the baraza and that the party's meeting had not been approved.&ldquo;They presented their request late. Other people (Kenya Medical Training Centre) had already booked the venue for a sensitisation campaign," he said.Charo noted that the officers were on the ground to do their job and that no arrests were made.&ldquo;We don't know why ODM was trying to force its way to the venue. The officers had to do their job. The law must be followed. The government has its mechanism of going about its duties,&rdquo; he said.Ben Tayari, ODM's Kinango MP aspirant, speaks to police in Kinango town, Kwale county, where a rally aborted, March 23, 2017. /MAUREEN MUDIPresident Uhuru Kenyatta's Jubilee Party has raided the Coast region and won several politicians to its side, forcing Opposition leaders to do the same.Last week, Joho's team took rallies to Taita Taveta and Lamu but they were pelted with mangoes and stones by irate residents who demanded that Joho respects the President.Uhuru barred Joho from attending the Mtongwe ferry re-launch and told him to stop following him around as he is not his wife.But Joho said he will continue pushing for his people's rights and will go wherever he pleases.[AUDIO] Stop following me like I'm your wife, Uhuru tells Joho at Mtongwe ferry launchThe party said it will return to Lamu for a major rally at Tononoka grounds this Sunday.ODM's plan to hold a rally parallel to Jubilee&rsquo;s in Mombasa on March 12 went into disarray after police reportedly declined to offer security.Mohamed Hatimy, the party's Mombasa chairman, claimed on Saturday that police refused to take their notification letter.Hatimy said the officers told them they would only guard Uhuru&rsquo;s rally at Tononoka grounds.
