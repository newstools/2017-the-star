The Jubilee Party will not use smartcards to verify its registered members during nominations scheduled for April.National Elections Board vice chairperson Esther Kangogo yesterday said the party will use its register. She spoke at Murang&rsquo;a Teachers College during the selection of members of the County Elections Board.Individual aspirants will have to mobilise their supporters to register as Jubilee members and participate in the primaries.Most aspirants had hoped the party would use the IEBC register in the county because many voters do not have smartcards.Kangogo said the party will provide a list of all registered members in every polling station on the nomination day.The party will provide enough ballot papers for every polling station to ensure nobody is locked out of the exercise.The nominations will be carried out in every polling station registered by the IEBC and will start at 6am and end at 6 pm. Aspirants had raised concerns only a section of Murang&rsquo;a voters have acquired the JP smartcard and might be locked out of nominations. Kangogo said the names of aspirants who try to bribe voters will be forwarded to the EACC.
