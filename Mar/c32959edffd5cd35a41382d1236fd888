IT seems some politicians have not realised that Kenyans know a leader will never step out of a car at a place perceived to be hostile. The security aides will ensure the politician (as a VIP or VVIP) addresses the crowds from the car's sunroof just in case things turn violent. A top Jubilee politicians seems to have mastered the art, which he uses in hostile regions where crowds are mobilised and paid to cheer him. He knows well the car shields him as part of his security and, in most cases, he is accompanied by fleets of chase cars.****************POLICE officers in an operation in Mbooni Forest have not been paid allowances. The officers (junior ranks) are living in hardship, whereas it is said their allowances run into the millions of Kenya shillings. They suspect their bosses have pocketed the funds. They want President Uhuru Kenyatta and Inspector of Police Joseph Boinnet to intervene. The top brass should also confirm the number of days the junior officers should be paid. It is alleged that senior officers exclude some days with excuses that the team was travelling or had not started the operation - to pocket the difference.*****************IS Nairobi police commander Japheth Koome aware of the return of the robbery of passengers at the Nairobi Machakos Country Bus Terminus and its environs by touts? Touts deployed by PSV operators to scout for passengers for a fee along Haile Selassie Avenue, Landhies Road, Muthurwa PSV terminus and the OTC area are coercing travellers into their respective fleets. The touts are harassing the travellers, mostly women travelling with children, and sometimes dragging them to their PSVs or, upon refusal, disappearing with their luggage. And officers at the Muoroto and Muthurwa police posts and Kamukunji police station have given complaints against this daylight robbery a deaf ear.*******************FORMER Mungiki leader Maina Njenga has made a formal application to the Jubilee Party to have him refunded the money he paid for nominations. Maina will be seeking to vie for Likipia senator under a Kanu ticket. Sources inside the Jubilee Party say Maina made his application formal on Friday. This is despite Maina revealing that he would vie on the Jubilee ticket after the court ordered the party to consider his application unconditionally. Maina had defected from Jubilee to Kanu before going back to Jubilee - in a span of less than five hours.
