Siaya governor hopeful William Oduol has denied he took a Sh40 million bribe to support Cornel Rasanga&rsquo;s reelection.Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo on Monday said Oduol met Rasanga&rsquo;s emissaries.&ldquo;Let Oduol confirm or deny if he did not meet [lawyer Dismuss] Wakla and Governance chief officer Joseph Ogutu at Pride Hotel,&rdquo; he said on Radio Mayienga FM.Oduol said Wakla called him while on his way to Bondo and they agreed to meet to discuss Sh6 million Rasanga was to pay after he lost a court case in 2013, leading to a by-election.Wakla is Oduol&rsquo;s former lawyer. Midiwo said Oduol&rsquo;s recent announcement that he will vote for Rasanga if he lost the primaries was an indication he is up to no good.
