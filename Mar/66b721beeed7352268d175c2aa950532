England midfielder Jack Wilshere is eager to make a move to AC Milan in the summer if Arsene Wenger remains Arsenal boss and decides to offload the England midfielder.Wilshere is nearing the end of his one-year Bournemouth loan spell and knows the Gunners could be set for massive changes, while he remains a top target for the Italians.The 25-year-old has just one year left on his &pound;90,000-a-week contract and has still to open discussions over a new deal. But he is aware he needs to make the right move to resurrect his stalling career. The Three Lions star was eager to move to the Italian giants last season before making the move to Bournemouth on transfer deadline day.David Beckham recommended the move to Wilshere after lavishing praise on the club, following two successful loan spells in Milan.It is understood that Wilshere remains interested in the move and has noted how England keeper Joe Hart&rsquo;s has enjoyed a successful season in Serie A with Torino.Watford, Crystal Palace, Roma and Benfica are also thought to be among clubs monitoring Wilshere&rsquo;s situation.Gunners manager Arsene Wenger remains a firm believer in Wilshere&rsquo;s ability - but is wary of relying too heavily on a player with such a poor injury record.One of Wilshere&rsquo;s biggest problems when fit, has been nailing down a regular position in the Arsenal team since Mesut Ozil&rsquo;s record &pound;42.5million move from Real Madrid four years ago.But with doubts remaining over the German&rsquo;s future at the Emirates, there remains a possibility he may be offered a new contract to remain at the club he has served since he was seven years old. If that happens, Wilshere may spend another year out on loan.Elsewwhere, Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho insists he had &lsquo;no hidden cause&rsquo; for the visit to Croatia, stating that he merely went to see &lsquo;some friends&rsquo;.The United boss was in attendance as Croatia beat Ukraine in Zagreb on Friday but he was adamant that he was not scouting transfer targets.Mourinho&rsquo;s trip came amid reports of United considering moves for Ivan Perisic, who missed Friday&rsquo;s game due to suspension, and Ivan Rakitic.But the former Chelsea manager insists that he visited Croatia to see friends: &ldquo;I have no hidden cause, I just came to enjoy my free days and visit some friends like Predrag Mijatovic and Davor Suker,&rdquo; Mourinho told HNTV.&ldquo;I know everyone believes I came to watch some players, but in football today you don&rsquo;t have to travel around in order to see some players, I know all of them well.&rdquo;Ivan Rakitic provided the assist for Nikola Kalinic as Croatia beat Ukraine 1-0 in ZagrebMourinho added: &ldquo;I came as a person that wants to relax and enjoy the nice weather, unlike the rainy weather in Manchester...&rdquo;The Portuguese boss saw Croatia run out 1-0 winners over Ukraine on Friday thanks to Nikola Kalinic&rsquo;s goal in the 38th minute.
