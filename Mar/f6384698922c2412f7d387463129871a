The insecurity across the country is happening at the worst possible time for the governing Jubilee Party. This is the time to showcase JP s first-term achievements and seek to endear the party to the electorate for reelection purposes. The violence in the North Rift and Laikipia can have long term solutions if residents of pastoralist areas are made to see less and less value in possessing large herds of livestock. A deliberate and concerted effort to provide water pans and education in pastoralist regions will address the root causes of invasions of farming areas by herders and their tens of thousands of thirsty and hungry animals. An educated Pokot or Turkana will not want industrial strength herds of animals that are difficult to feed when the annual drought hits. Knee-jerk reactions to the violence only feed the cycles of conflict, especially when the policing is completely wrongheaded and involves such thuggish tactics as burning homes and granaries. The long-term solutions should begin in earnest now.
