Garissa Governor Nathif Jama has mismanaged county resources and failed residents by not ensuring they have basic amenities, Senator Yussuf Haji has said.He said the governor has failed devolution, ignored residents' plea for services, such as provision of clean water, and even skipped several meetings organised by area MPs to resolve issues.Jama has denied the claims.Haji spoke on Monday in Masalani during the formalisation of the Tolomoge Alliance that brings together the Abduwak and Samawadhal communities.&ldquo;Before devolution, Masalani town was booming with a lot of businesses, but now many people have shifted to other trades because the money given to the county is not trickling down [to the people],&rdquo; he said.Ijara MP Ahmed Ibrahim Abass said they will vote out Jama as he has failed to deliver to the expectations of residents.Jama said that anyone with tangible evidence on resource mismanagement in the county should report it to investigation agencies. He spoke to the Star on the phone.Speaking separately, county director of communication Abdikadir Sugow said no institution or individual has summoned the governor over financial misappropriation.He told the Star on the phone that Haji, as the senator, has had many opportunities to question the county administration on spending and its projects but he has not.Haji is on record only one other time of accusing Jama of misuse of resources.Sugow said the senator should stop politicking and accusing Jama without evidence.In the Masalani town function on Monday, leaders campaigned for Abdi Dagane, whom the Samawathal have selected to run for deputy governor. Dagane will be the running mate of Ali Bunow Korane from the Abduwak clan.Incumbent Jama is expected to retain his deputy Abdullahi Hussein (Samawathal) as his running mate in his reelection bid.
