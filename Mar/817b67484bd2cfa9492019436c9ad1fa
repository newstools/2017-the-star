A parliamentary aspirant has said the "infamous" negotiated democracy is heightening tension among communities in northeastern, where it it widely practicsd.Fafi MP aspirant Salah Yakub said it has emerged some elders are being compromised by powerful politicians, putting the credibility of the process to question. Our communities are realising that the council of elders has failed to deliver credible nominations and they cannot be trusted. Elections, a sensitive matter that touches on the core of the society, should be taken seriously by the elders," he said.In negotiated democracy, elders prevail upon candidates to step down in favour those they have settled for.In Fafi, the Abduwak Council of Elders has already settled on incumbent Barre Shill to defend his seat despite resistance from some elders, who feel he is not the best candidate.Yakub and Abdikarim Rati have refused to step down in favour of Shill.Addressing residents of Bura East, Yakub said the practice has brought deep divisions among clans, with the smaller ones being locked out of resource allocation.He said elders making decisions for Fafi people are not voters in the constituency and they don t know the suffering of the people.Yakub said the elders' decisions do not resonate with common mwananchi. We have refused these decisions because they have been made in big hotels in Nairobi by people who don t know how Fafi is and are not voters. We will not accept it. That is why I have decided to offer myself for election because I believe I am best suited to tackle deep-rooted issues bedeviling the constituency," he said.
