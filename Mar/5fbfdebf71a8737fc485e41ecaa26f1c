The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission has set up a technical team to verify the credibility of education papers presented by politicians running for office.Speaking during a media briefing, chairman Wafula Chebukati (pictured) on Friday said the team will have representatives from the Education ministry and other state agencies.The commission is focused on barring those with fake certificates, especially governor and presidential aspirants, who must have at least a bachelor&rsquo;s degree. This is a constitutional requirement.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s part of our outreach activities for purposes of enforcing Chapter Six of the Constitution. The commission cannot do it alone. We will be looking forward to the technical team to complete its work and give us a report and we hope the exercise will go well,&rdquo; Chebukati said.Education CS Fred Matiang&rsquo;i, who was present at the event, said next week they will announce how the process will work once there is a confirmation that certificates of certain hopefuls are valid.
