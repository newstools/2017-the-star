Mike Sonko has offered a Sh500,000 reward for any police officer who will "shoot and kill land grabbers" captured in a video pulling down a gate in Karen.The Nairobi Senator said he will stand surety in case of repercussions and that he will do whatever it takes to recover the land.Sonko said the "shameless goons" seen at the residence along Warai South road took advantage of his absence.He is in Mombasa with Jubilee Party members led by President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto.The minute-long footage shows men cutting down a hedge and pulling down a black gate.They were later arrested and taken to Karen police station but were set free for lack of evidence."We were tipped off about two hours ago [but] the men have been released," said an officer who sought anonymity.In 2015, the Senator obtained a court order preventing a private developer from constructing on the land on which a grandmother's house once stood.Sonko said he obtained the order following the developer's demolition of the 102 year-old woman's house in Pangani, Nairobi.Read: Sonko stops granny's eviction after private developer destroys her houseIn the same year, the Senator led a demonstration against the grabbing of a portion of land set aside for a water reservoir in Nairobi's Loresho area.Bulldozers and trucks were on the land on which construction had been halted after residents complained.
