Ukambani leaders have asked Nasa to hand Wiper boss Kalonzo Musyoka the presidential ticket as he has the backing of more than two million Kambas.Led by former Water CS Charity Ngilu, they said they will support Kalonzo in leading the Opposition team to the election."The best leadership in our nation will now be seen by Kalonzo and I working together. Nasa principals must agree that there is need to have the best so that the country can move forward," she said on Tuesday.Ngilu celebrated her exoneration by the Court of Appeal in the Sh8 billion Karen land case; the trial was declared unconstitutional.Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana said Ukambani leaders had met and agreed to support Kalonzo to ensure that he is the presidential candidate."We are supporting Kalonzo not based on his ethnicity but because he has what it takes to be the president Kenya needs. We are glad that Kalonzo and Ngilu have sat and decided to work together," he said.But Chama Cha Uzalendo leader Wavinya Ndeti said the Wiper chief needs ODM boss Raila Odinga's support to become the NASA flagbearer.She observed that out of all the parties that make up NASA, ODM has more leaders in Parliament.Ndeti said Wiper MPs should sweet-talk Raila into shelving his presidential bid to back Kalonzo."Wiper MPs should accept reality and know there is no way Kalonzo can be NASA's flag bearer without Raila's backing," she said.Read: Raila asked to honour Cord MoU, support Kalonzo bid for presidentAlso read: Kalonzo: I will defeat Uhuru, Ruto next yearThe CCU leader said Kalonzo approached leaders of "small political parties" in Ukambani and asked them to join NASA and support his presidential bid.But Ndeti accused Machakos Senator Johnson Muthama of interfering with the talks."I am wondering why Muthama is going everywhere criticising other people's parties in Ukambani; let him tell us his party. The likes of Muthama need to wake up and understand that Kenya is democratic," she said.&ldquo;Muthama is not the leader of any political party. Wavinya Ndeti, Kalonzo Musyoka, Charity Ngilu, Kivutha Kibwana and Mutua Katuku are leaders of CCU, Wiper, Narc, Muungano and People&rsquo;s Trust Party respectively."Ndeti said everyone has a right to form or join any political party.Kalonzo demanded the presidential ticket in January saying he was no longer going to play diplomat.Noting he was ready and determined to take Jubilee head-on, Kalonzo asked residents to register in large numbers so they can vote.He also told residents to punish leaders who turned out to be traitors and abandoned Wiper party for Jubilee.More on this: Kalonzo no longer playing diplomat, demands Cord presidential ticket
