An aspirant in the Baringo Governor race has asked the incumbent Benjamin Cheboi to explain where he sourced the money to buy 20 buses for campaigns. Knut Koibatek branch executive secretary Stanley Kiptis accused the county boss of spending public funds on his campaigns ahead of the Jubilee nominations slated for April. The politician, who is also eyeing the Jubilee Party ticket to the August 8 polls, said the governor's earnings cannot allow him to get the vehicles. "I wonder where he (Cheboi) collected all this money. We are sure it is not from the Sh800,000 monthly salary paid to governors," Kiptis said. Tens of youths were spotting riding around Eldama Ravine town in the 33-seater buses chanting 'Cheboi Tena' slogans. "We have not heard any public fund-raising organised by his supporters. This must be probed as there are many incomplete and stalled projects in the county." He cited a road that was set to be commissioned by Deputy President on Saturday as among those that were fixed in the last minute ahead of the DP's tour. "We saw workers putting final touches on the road this morning. We wonder what they were still waiting for," Kiptis said on Saturday. The aspirant further raised fears that the JP nominations may not be free and fair. There is a claim that the buses, branded in Jubilee colours, were donated by United Nations for projects in the county. But Cheboi, when contacted for comment, denied the allegations saying he uses his own money in the campaigns. "If someone is challenged financially, he or she should keep quiet and swallow his own bitter bills," the governor said. "It always expensive to plan political rallies." Cheboi is facing competition from Kiptis and former Kenya School of Government director Isaac
