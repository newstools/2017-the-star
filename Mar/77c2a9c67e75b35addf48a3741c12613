Tiaty MP Asman Kamama has dismissed allegations that he has ditched Jubilee Party for PNU. Kamama said his documents are still intact with Jubilee and he is not planning to leave the party as has been speculated by his opponents. “I am rooted in Jubilee and I am very confident I will win the elections to continue serve my Tiaty people,” he said. The MP spoke to the Star on Wednesday. He was responding to rumours on social media that he has ditched Jubilee because he was mentioned among leaders allegedly inciting residents to fight in Baringo. Kamama is said to have lost the prospect of clinching the JP ticket after the arrest of his close allies in connection to the recent killing of his competitor Pepe Kitambaa and Loyamorok MCA Frederick Cheretei. The two were shot dead in Marigat on February 18. Kamama is said to have feared he may be grounded in the April primaries as his Pokot electorate turned hostile against him. Kitambaa was a tight competitor likely to thrash him in the nominations. Kamama denied he is panicking after another ‘people-chosen’ aspirant, the Rev Simon Kiuta, presented his papers to Jubilee Party. “I know Kiuta as the opponent who went missing after the 2007 election upon garnering 1,500 votes,” the MP said. Kamama said Kiuta lost the seat to him and he will be beaten again in August. “This is someone who vanished until now, only to resurface a few months to the election thinking he will convince the people that he can lead them,” he said. Kamama termed the rumours he has moved to PNU as propaganda meant to tarnish his name ahead of JP nominations in April. Kiuta said he had no ill feelings against Kamama when he presented his papers to Jubilee Party to vie for the parliamentary seat.
