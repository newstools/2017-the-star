The national government&rsquo;s handling of Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho is increasingly a major cause for concern.In recent weeks the government has prevented Joho from attending a presidential function, confining him to his offices until President Uhuru Kenyatta re-launched the Mtongwe Ferry.The police have also disrupted a Joho campaign rally, using the paramilitary General Service Unit and a massive amount of teargas.The Kenya Revenue Authority has frozen Joho&rsquo;s bank accounts.The government may well have legitimate reasons for its actions, but the optics are terrible. Speaking in Mombasa on Saturday, government spokesperson Eric Kiraithe declared the police act on "intelligence".The government needs to explain why it has singled out Governor Joho for this serial extraordinarily heavy-handed treatment. Failing this, and given a continuation of preventing, disrupting and invasively probing his financial transactions, the impression that government is using public institutions and police time to settle obscure political scores will become irresistible, even among the ruling JP&rsquo;s most ardent supporters.
