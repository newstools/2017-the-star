Heavy rains have damaged farms and submerged acres of crops in Munana village, Funyula, Busia county.After a heavy Sunday night downpour, residents woke up to flooded houses and destroyed farms. Many families have been displaced.Residents accuse the National Irrigation Board for shoddy construction of a dam that overflowed. They say construction of the dam has stalled for more than 10 years.They held a peaceful demonstration on Tuesday and assembled at the deputy county commissioner&rsquo;s office, demanding compensation from NIB. They threatened to sue the board if they are not compensated for their losses.Norah Okida said she has been a farmer for 40 years but has never witnessed such devastation.&ldquo;We have signed tenders to supply vegetables to schools. With the crops now destroyed we are left in a hopeless situation,&rdquo; she said.Edwin Ojiambo blamed the flooding on the dam contractors and said they did a shoddy job.He urged the national government to get a new contractor.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whom to turn to now after this destruction. I have children at university for who I pay college fees using money I get from selling my farm produce,&rdquo; Ojiambo said.Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong visited the area on Tuesday.He urged Busia legislators to emulate their Mwea counterparts who lobbied the national government to have rice farmers in the area receive Sh300 million to boost production.Ojaamong urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to intervene as the flooding was caused by a project initiated by his government.He said the project stalled due to the contractor&rsquo;s laxity and as a result some families have been rendered homeless while others have incurred huge losses.&ldquo;I will petition the national government to have the projects which NIB started in Samia, Matayos and Nambale subcounties completed. The project is becoming a white elephant. The flooding in Samia, which has rendered several families homeless, calls for immediate action to end the menace, thus the need to send engineers to find a lasting solution to the flooding,&rdquo; Ojaamong said.The governor said he will send the county disaster management team to assess the damage.Area MCA John Obwogo said the NIB project has not been completed for 10 years and even farmers affected by the project have not been compensated.&ldquo;We want Eng [Daniel] Barasa who was NIB managing director to solve the plight of my residents before he comes to the area in search of votes,&rdquo; he said.Barasa wants to run for governor on the Jubilee ticket.The unexpected rains fell after a prolonged drought that has ravaged many counties in Kenya.Residents have been struggling to access water after boreholes and shallow wells dried up.
