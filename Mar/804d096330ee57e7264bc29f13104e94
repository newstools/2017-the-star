What about the rest of the tribes," asked the chairman who was accompanied by Archbishop Julius Oloo and Bishop Jasper Wadegu.The religious leaders appealed to the President to play his role as the symbol of unity and bring the people together despite their ethnic, religious and political backgrounds.They also cited Uhuru's remarks in Turkana and Mombasa, describing them as disturbing. The President referred to Governor Josephat Nanok as a fool and a devil after claims that his government has allocated Turkana county insufficient funds.An agitated Uhuru, who spoke in Kiswahili, also responded to claims that he has interests in the county's oil.He said no one should tell Kenyans the lie about him needing oil belonging to others.More on this: [AUDIO] Uhuru calls Nanok a foolish devil for raising queries on oil wealthAlso see: [AUDIO] Stop following me like I'm your wife, Uhuru tells Joho at Mtongwe ferry launch
