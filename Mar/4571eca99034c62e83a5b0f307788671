Opposition leaders are not sincere in dealing with corruption, Mukurweini MP Kabandao Kabando has said.In a statement yesterday, Kabando said ODM leader Raila Odinga, Wiper&rsquo;s Kalonzo Musyoka and ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi are &ldquo;being hypocritical on the graft war&rdquo;.&ldquo;They shamelessly close their eyes on the rot in counties controlled by their allies. Yes, there are some blemishes in Jubilee circles, but the truth is also that there is stinking filth and blatant looting by Cord functionaries,&rdquo; the MP said.He added, &ldquo;President Uhuru Kenyatta has sacked six Cabinet Secretaries over graft. How many ODM governors has Raila reprimanded? Mr Odinga, shape up or shut up.&rdquo; Kabando said he respects the three opposition leaders but urged them to grow their commitment to fighting corruption.&ldquo;My buddies and colleagues know that Raila is my friend whom I respect. Even Kalonzo Musyoka&rsquo;s circles know I respect him too. I&rsquo;ve posted on this wall that Musalia Mudavadi has rare admirable gentlemanly mien,&rdquo; Kabando said.
