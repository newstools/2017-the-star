The Kirinyaga government has suspended 63 of 87 doctors who did not report to work on Monday. The rest are studying in universities.Speaking at the Kerugoya Referral Hospital yesterday, Governor Joseph Ndathi gave them 10 days to resume work or his administration will sack them and employ &ldquo;medics ready to serve residents&rdquo;.&lsquo;&rsquo;In Kirinyaga, we have invested heavily in the health sector. Out of our Sh2.3 billion wage bill, Sh1.2 billion is paid to health workers,&rsquo;&rsquo; Ndathi said.The governor said he will ensure doctors who return to work are protected. The striking doctors were given show-cause letters why medical services director Hesborn Gakuo should not sack them.No doctor had returned to work by press time yesterday. The doctors have been on strike for 100 days now.Last week during the Fourth Devolution Conference in Naivasha, President Uhuru Kenyatta and the Council of Governors ordered the doctors to report to work as their grievances are addressed.
