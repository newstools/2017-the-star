The owner of the Karen property that was invaded by goons two weeks ago died at a Nairobi hospital last week. Julius Mungai died days after his home along Warai South road was invaded by people who cut his hedge and pulled down the gate. Details regarding his death were not immediately available but Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko, who was pushing for justice, said he will be buried at his Waithaka farm on Tuesday. "I assure his family that I shall fight for your justice until you get back your property," he said. The Senator, known for fighting off land grabbers, came out to defend Mungai and even offered a Sh500,000 reward for any police officer who would "shoot and kill the land grabbers".

"The late and his wife acquired the Karen property legally in 2003. However, a prominent city lawyer has [also] been alleging [ownership]," he posted on his Facebook page. He added that mysterious circumstances surrounded the dispute over the property and that he lawyer was also involved in the grabbing of a property in Upper Hill. Sonko said the property belongs to Judith Njenga, a 78-year-old widow. "This rich grabber advocate had sold Njenga's property to a private developer at Sh1 billion but I managed to thwart all his cunning efforts after [the widow's] family sought my help on time,' he said. Sonko promised to continue helping the families and ensure the land grabbers are prosecuted and the property recovered.
