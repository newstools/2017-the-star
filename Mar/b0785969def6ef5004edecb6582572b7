A rare starter for his club Arsenal this season, Olivier Giroud once again proved his worth to France when he bagged a double in their 3-1 win in Luxembourg in a World Cup qualifier on Saturday.The powerful striker&rsquo;s 22nd and 23rd international goals lifted him to 10th on the list of France&rsquo;s all-time top scorers after being Les Bleus&rsquo; leading marksman in 2016.&ldquo;Even if he&rsquo;s got difficulties at his club, Olivier often scores for us,&rdquo; said France coach Didier Deschamps.Giroud has started only seven Premier League games for Arsenal, but he showed no sign of rustiness against Luxembourg as his muscular presence proved invaluable against a team playing very defensively.He scored the first goal from close range after a fine pass from Djibril Sidibe and headed home the second from Benjamin Mendy&rsquo;s cross in his 60th international.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a real pleasure because strikers need goals and statistics are important for us,&rdquo; Giroud said. &ldquo;Whatever people say about me, I stay true to myself and give my answers on the pitch.&rdquo;His performance helped France stay top of qualifying Group A with 13 points from five games, three ahead of Sweden who they visit on June 9.Meanwhile, Romelu Lukaku struck late to rescue a 1-1 World Cup qualifying draw for depleted Belgium on Saturday against a Greek side who were down to 10 men for the final 25 minutes and finished with nine.Lukaku&rsquo;s turn and shot in the 89th minute cancelled out the opener from Kostas Mitroglou, who scored just 18 seconds after halftime in the visitors&rsquo; first real attack of the game, to keep Belgium top of Group H.Belgium, missing injured Eden Hazard and Kevin De Bruyne, took advantage of Panagiotis Tachtsidis&rsquo;s dismissal in the 65th minute for a second yellow card as they subjected the Greek defence to a wave of attacks. Giorgos Tzavellas was also sent off for a second yellow after a scuffle broke out deep into injury time.Belgium had destroyed the other four group opponents, scoring 21 goals to just one against, while Greece came into the match undefeated.Belgium were playing only for the second time since 2012 without both Hazard and De Bruyne, their two most creative forces.With right-back Thomas Meunier also absent, Roberto Martinez had called the match the biggest test of his near eight-month stint as national coach.Still, with a free-roaming Dries Mertens and a recalled Radja Nainggolan taking up Hazard and De Bruyne&rsquo;s positions, Belgium had appeared to be in control, although with only two chances from Marouane Fellaini to show in a dour first half. Greek cheers and hugs at the end showed their delight with a point away against the group favourites. Belgium lead with 13 points, two more than Greece, with Bosnia on 10.
