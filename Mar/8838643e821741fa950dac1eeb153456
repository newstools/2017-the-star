Leicester City striker Jamie Vardy is hoping to fire regularly after his brace in Monday&rsquo;s 3-1 victory over Liverpool helped the struggling champions end their five-game losing streak in the Premier League.Vardy, who scored 24 league goals during Leicester&rsquo;s title-winning campaign last year, has been far from his prolific best this season, managing nine goals across competitions so far.The 30-year-old also scored in back-to-back games for the first time since September, having netted in Leicester&rsquo;s 2-1 Champions League loss at Spanish side Seville last week.&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been very frustrated with the amount of goals I&rsquo;ve got this season but hopefully those two can push me on and hopefully there will be a lot to follow,&rdquo; said Vardy.Leicester have been in a turmoil after media reports suggested a players&rsquo; revolt led to Claudio Ranieri&rsquo;s sacking on Thursday, nine months after the manager led the club to the league title.Vardy, goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel and winger Marc Albrighton have since denied the allegations.&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve come under a lot of unfair stick with the stuff that&rsquo;s been in the press,&rdquo; Vardy said. &ldquo;What you&rsquo;ve seen out there is a reaction from the lads, the performance showed exactly that. Now it&rsquo;s down to us to do that consistently moving forward.&rdquo;Leicester, who are 15th in the table and two points above the bottom three with 12 games remaining, host relegation rivals Hull City on Saturday.
