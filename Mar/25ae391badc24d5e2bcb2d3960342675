Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya yesterday denied he is meddling with Trans Nzoia politics.Last week, elders from Trans Nzoia accused the governor of interfering with the county politics on how positions should be shared in NASA.Oparanya was reported to have said a fortnight ago in Kitale that Trans Nzoia Governor Patrick Khaemba of Ford Kenya should defend his seat and ODM&rsquo;s Protus Chemonges be his running mate.&ldquo;Trans Nzoia people are mature enough to elect their leaders,&rdquo; elder Peter Masinde said yesterday.But Oparanya in statement said he went to Trans Nzoia on invitation of the county ODM coordinating team. &ldquo;Throughout my addresses, I never mentioned names or elective positions. I was surprised when one NASA principal called me on the same issue,&rdquo; he said. Oparanya said he enjoys a cordial working relationship with Khaemba and he had notified him of his presence in the county in advance.
