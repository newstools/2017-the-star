The government’s M-Akiba mobile money bond is a very good and innovative move indeed. It makes Kenya one of the first countries in the world to give ordinary people a chance to invest in mobile-traded government securities. The M-Akiba bond will require only Sh3,000 and a mobile phone connected to M-Pesa or Airtel Money. It’s safer for the government as it poses no foreign exchange fluctuation risks; has a good rate for the ordinary Kenyan who invests in it; and will suck up liquidity from the economy and make the banks want to lend again to wananchi. M-Akiba comes in the great spirit and tradition of M-Pesa, and could well become as great a trailblazer in Kenya, the region and the world. Initially, government had targeted Sh5 billion, but the bond begins trading tomorrow as a Sh150 million pilot. It will come as no surprise if the government soon has reason to think about M-Akiba in the billions of shillings.
