The number of shopping malls are set to increase in the short to medium-term, analysts at Britam Asset Managers have said, citing rising appetite by global retailers. Britam Asset Managers' real estate report for the financial year 2016 shows that international retailers seeking to tap into the East African market are using Kenya as an entry point. The retailers are set to boost the development of malls in both national and county level as developers seek to provide convenience in form of retail space. &ldquo;With regards to development, heightened activity is expected in the counties as well as in retail thirsty nodes in the city,&rdquo; the analysts say in the report. Over the past recent months international retailers including South Africa&rsquo;s clothing chain Foschini Group, UK&rsquo;s F&amp;F, Turkish LC Waikiki, Austria-based Swarovski and India&rsquo;s Anmol have opened stores in the country.LC Waikiki country manager Kremena Pencheva, speaking during the launch of the Turkish brand said that the firm&rsquo;s presence in the country had been delayed by a year due to a lack of location.The international retailers will also increase the creation of jobs in the local market.The report states that despite an increase in malls in the country rents in malls are expected to remain relatively stable as new retail stock is added to the market. The report adds that this will even out the demand and supply dynamics.The Two Rivers Mall which opened its doors to the public on February 17 is home to most of the international brands including Majid Al Futtaim&rsquo;s second Carrefour hypermarket in Nairobi.Another such mall is Runda&rsquo;s Rosslyn Riviera set to open in March while those in the pipeline include the Laxcon Mall along Kangundo Road, Waterfront in Karen and General Motors Mall, Bellevue Mall and South Fields Mall, all located on Mombasa Road. &ldquo;The local retail scene, which is the second largest in Africa after South Africa in terms of size, continues to register increased interest from international retailers,&rdquo; the report stated. In the report, local retailers are also embarking on expansion both within the country and into the East African bloc. &ldquo;Current retailers in Kenya have announced expansion plans amounting to an excess of Sh1.2 billion,&rdquo; the report states. &ldquo;Naivas unveiled its Sh470 million expansion plan to increase its branch network, Ukwala awaits a capital injection of Sh755 million from Botswana's Choppies while Nakumatt opened a third store in Rwanda marking its 64 outlets in total.&rdquo;
