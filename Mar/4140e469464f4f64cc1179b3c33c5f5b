Tottenham Hotspur fear they could lose their striking totem Harry Kane for their late season trophy push.Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino outlined his concerns after Kane hobbled off after just seven minutes in Spurs&rsquo; 6-0 thrashing of third tier Millwall in the FA Cup sixth round.Kane appeared to turn his ankle badly when falling awkwardly while tussling for the ball with Millwall defender Jake Cooper.&ldquo;It looks like last time against Sunderland, it was the same ankle,&rdquo; said Pochettino. &ldquo;We need to assess some more and after Monday we will see.&rdquo;The previous injury resulted in Kane missing five league games and two League Cup matches and Spurs, currently second in the Premier League, are so reliant on his goals that the sight of him leaving White Hart Lane on crutches and wearing a protective boot can only have dismayed Pochettino.However, Kane&rsquo;s absence was not missed on the day as South Korea striker Son Heung-min netted a brilliant hat-trick and Kane&rsquo;s replacement Christian Eriksen also scored a beauty before Dele Alli and substitute Vincent Janssen got in on the act.It all made for an emotional occasion at Spurs&rsquo; storied 118-year-old ground which they will leave for a season at the end of the campaign before returning to a new stadium at the site.Third-tier side Millwall had beaten three top-flight teams en route to the quarter-finals but Premier League title chasers Spurs dominated them from the outset at the grand old ground where they have not lost all season.Eriksen made the key breakthrough with a brilliant snap shot on the turn on the half-hour mark before Son crashed home a thunderous left-foot strike 10 minutes later.The Korean then struck a sweet first-time, right-foot volley from Kieran Trippier&rsquo;s through ball in the 54th before Alli netted his 16th of the season in all competitions, a tap-in after a well-crafted move, in the 72nd.The icing on the cake was a first goal from open play in the 79th minute for Spurs&rsquo; under-achieving striker Janssen. The Dutchman may yet be needed in their title challenge if Kane is out of action for long.Son&rsquo;s third came in stoppage time, a volley that slipped through the clutches of hapless Millwall keeper Tom King.&ldquo;A hat-trick from Son and Janssen scored... the team was good. We need to congratulate them, they were waiting for the opportunity and they took it and stepped up,&rdquo; said Pchettino. &ldquo;In football you always need to be ready. Not only him (Janssen) but different players too will have the opportunity to play more and they need to be ready.&rdquo;The array of glorious goals, particularly from man-of-the-match Son and Eriksen, was a fitting way for Spurs to say farewell to Cup competition at the old White Hart Lane.
