Attendants at a bar in Maralal town on Saturday accused area OCS Solomon Odera of threatening them with a gun. They said the officer entered the bar and brandished his gun saying he would shoot anyone who dared stop him. "He came straight inside and pointed his gun at us," an attendant, who sought anonymity for fear of being victimised, told the Star. The lot said the officer used a civilian car when he went to the Club 7 joint on Friday night, making it difficult for them to identify him. "We demanded that he identifies himself since we could determine whether he was a police officer or a criminal," the attendant said. They said the cop has a tendency of harassing patrons at different night clubs in Maralal town. But Odera told the Star on phone he got information at 3am of an ugly fight between two revelers at the bar. The officer said he decided to use his car after the station's driver failed to wake up. "I found the two fighting in the bar's kitchen. They attacked me as I tried to separate them," Odera said. "I managed to arrest the two men but as I was bundling them into my car's boot, other revelers started shouting at me." The officer said that some people, including administration police officers, followed him to the station threatening to beat him up.
