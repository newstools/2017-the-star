Nairobi s hospitality industry faces an oversupply of hotel rooms in near term which could lead to a bubble if not checked, analysts at business advisory firm PKF have suggested.The consultants project more than 2,000 hotel rooms could be added in two years, which could significantly surpass demand.This is likely to push average occupancy to a low 25-30 per cent from the current 50-60 per cent, they said. Hotels borrow 60 per cent financing from banks. If they cannot make profits, we are going to see a lot of non-performing loans, PKF chief executive Atul Shah said. We are going to have a Mombasa effect where hotels cannot renew themselves. About 10 hotel chains are expected to open businesses in the country this year. They include Pullman, Park-Inn and Best Western in Westlands, Lazizi Premiere and Hilton Garden Inn near the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport.However, the Kenya Association of Hoteliers and Caterers does not foresee the bubble.The group said increased businesses in hospitality industry is as a result of Nairobi being a regional investment hub.KAHC executive officer Sam Ikwaye said the city remains a key conference destination in Africa.He said the upgrade of the JKIA to Category One Status on February 23, paving the way for direct flights to the US, will play a critical role in increasing business and tourism activities in Nairobi. The more (hotels), the merrier. It gives more variety and options. The international hotel chains must have done a feasibility study before setting foot in Nairobi so we don t see it as a bubble, Ikwaye said on the phone.This will add 2,900 rooms and expand Kenya s capacity by 14.5 per cent from 18,100 rooms in 2015, to about 20,700 in 2020, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers Hotel Outlook 2016-20.PKF warned that growth in the steadily recovering tourism sector is likely to be dragged by overpriced products. We need to be price competitive. Our pricing levels are horrendous. It is cheaper to fly to Dubai for a week than to Kenya for a weekend. We need to be at the low end of pricing to get volumes, Shah said.The country s target of two million tourist arrivals has remained elusive despite concerted marketing campaigns by the Kenya Tourism Board and Brand Kenya.International tourist arrivals to Kenya were 877,602 last year, a slight increase from 752,073 arrivals in 2015, according to KTB data.Total arrivals were 861,758 in 2014, 1.09 million (2013) and 1.23 million in 2012.
