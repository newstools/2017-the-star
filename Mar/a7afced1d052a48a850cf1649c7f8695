Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga has said he will sue Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo and his Rarieda counterpart Nicholas Gumbo for calling him a thief. They have consistently accused him of misusing county funds. The governor said he “stomached” the two calling him a thief since 2014, giving them time to present their evidence in court, but they have not. Rasanga said the character assassination mission the duo have embarked on must be tamed and the two will serve as an example to those with such behaviours. He spoke at Gagira in Rarieda on Saturday, a few kilometres from Gumbo’s home. But Gumbo and Midiwo dared Rasanga to sue them, insisting that Rasanga is a thief. Midiwo said he will continue calling Rasanga a thief, saying it’s not in doubt that he has swindled the county. Gumbo said Rasanga has stolen county money because in 2013 he had no money, but he built a mansion in one year. The two spoke in Gem constituency on Saturday.
