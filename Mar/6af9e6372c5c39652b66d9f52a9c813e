AP officers on Tuesday night seized 18 donkeys in Ndeiya ward, Limuru. This follows rising cases of donkeys being stolen and slaughtered by unscrupulous butchers.The two owners had a permit to transport the animals but they ran away into the dark. They were accosted at midnight. They later sent a boda boda operator to take the document to the officers and request them to release the animals.But the officers would not listen. They drove the animals to Ndeiya assistant county commissioner&rsquo;s office for the night.&ldquo;These people had a permit, but they are not revealing where they were taking the animals," Limuru AP commander James Mwaura said."We do not take for granted issues to do with donkey theft in this area because we know how people have been fed with the donkey meat.&rdquo;He said they are treating the transportation of the donkeys as suspect. Mwaura warned that anyone who will be caught transporting an animal at night will be arrested.He said they suspect the animals had been brought on foot from Narok.&ldquo;We are urging the public to be vigilant and report new animals in their neighbourhood. We appreciate that neighbours sell cows, goats, sheep and even chicken to each other, but they have agreements and witnesses. I want them to report to prevent stolen animals from coming to our area,&rdquo; waura said.
