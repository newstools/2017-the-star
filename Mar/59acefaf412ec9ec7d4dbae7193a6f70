The county government plans to petition Parliament to allow it use as a graveyard the 67-acre forest near the filled-up 100-acre Langata cemetery.&ldquo;It is a national crisis. You cannot have people die and there is no place to bury them in a county like Nairobi. It is a big problem,&rdquo; Lands executive Christopher Khaemba told the Star on Monday.This after the Kenya Forest Service rejected its request to swap the filled-up cemetery with the forest.KFS said the government allocated the old Nairobi City Council 50 acres in the 1990s to expand the cemetery. It has asked City Hall to account for the land.&ldquo;Converting forest to other uses is tedious. It must be degazetted and this must pass [through] Parliament,&rdquo; KFS natural forest conservation and management deputy director Charity Munyasia said last month.No record of 50 acresBut Khaemba said the forest land is the county&rsquo;s only option and they will pursue it to the end.&ldquo;We are petitioning Parliament to give the necessary debate and the necessary recommendation,&rdquo; he said.Speaking to the Star at City Hall on Monday, Khaemba said there are no records that the national government gave City Hall 50 acres. &ldquo;I have tried perusing all files that are here, [but the 50 acres are] nowhere in the records,&rdquo; Khaemba said.&ldquo;I went to my colleague in the health department, he showed me the files. I interviewed staff there, including the current county secretary (Robert Ayisi) who was in the health department for long. There was no such offer given to us.&rdquo; He said the county has written to KFS to provide any communication on the allocation, but it has not.&ldquo;And you know something like that would have been very loud. It could have been published in the press,&rdquo; Khaemba said.
