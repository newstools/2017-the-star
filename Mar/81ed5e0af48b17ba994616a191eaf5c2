I&rsquo;m sure we will have more time to celebrate once things settle down but feels really good to win the Kenya Open after failing to make the cut last year. I&rsquo;m glad I have achieved this feat in a country where my mum was born. My mum was born in Kenya in the 60s and moved to the UK in the 70s. My dad was born in the United Kingdom and I have lived there all my life. My mum returned to Kenya for the first time and I&rsquo;m glad this has happened in her presence,&rdquo; Rai, who finished seventh in the prestigious Johannesburg Open earlier in the year, said.Rai who lives in Wolverhampton, England, was never in the lead until the last day when he attested to his course adversaries what stuff he is made off.&ldquo;Consistency and practice has paid off,&rdquo; quipped the 22 year old golfer, who turned professional in 2012.
