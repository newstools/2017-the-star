Allies of Deputy President William Ruto in the North Rift now want Jubilee to drop the use of smartcards during the party&rsquo;s primaries next month.Some of the aspirants have warned the smartcards will cause flawed nominations and chaos, which will dent Jubilee&rsquo;s image ahead of August 8 poll.&ldquo;We are a just few weeks to the nominations, yet the majority of members cannot access the cards. That means they will not participate in the nominations, which might cause chaos,&rdquo; Chomba said.Governor Alex Tolgos said jubilee should look for alternative means to conduct credible nominations other than using the smartcards, will lock out many members from participating in the primaries.Sources indicate that most of the 10 million cards distributed by the party were bought by wealthy aspirants to give to their supporters. Jubilee official in the North Rift David Koech, however, said they are still distributing the cards.&ldquo;The party is of the view that the use of the cards will ensure free, fair and credibal primaries, and we are doing all we can to ensure all members get these cards,&rdquo; Koech said.Some of the Jubilee aspirants in West Pokot have also asked the party&rsquo;s leadership to get rid of the recently launched smartcards.Geoffrey Lipale and John Murpus led the aspirants who complained that the use of the cards will lock out a huge majority of residents in the nominations.&ldquo;One needs a mobile phone to register as a member using the smartcard, and the majority of people in our county still don't have mobile phones,&rdquo; Lipale said. He said only 30 per cent of residents have phones.The party had said the smartcards, which have a members&rsquo; name, national identity number, mobile phone contact and voting details were aimed at ensuring a transparent nomination process.
