Kenyan Premier League champions Tusker and Gor Mahia battle in the season opening DSTV Super Cup at Afraha Stadium tomorrow.The confirmation of the encounter indicates that the uncertainity over the start of the 2017 season could be over. Traditionally pitting KPL league champions against the domestic cup winners, the organisers have enlisted league runners up Gor mahia for a go against Tusker after the Ruaraka-based side bagged the domestic double last season.&ldquo;This is to inform you that the 2017 Super Cup will be played between Tusker and Gor Mahia on Sunday at the Afraha Stadium in Nakuru. Kick-off 3pm,&rdquo; read a brief statement from KPL.Already reeling from the ignominy of being eliminated from the preliminary round of the Caf Champions League in spite of his lofty aspirations, Tusker coach George Nsiimbe will be seeking to prove that he is not out of his depth in the managerial role with the double winning brewers.Like his rival in the opposite dug out, K&rsquo;Ogalo tactician, Ze Maria has a lot to prove to the club&rsquo;s rank and file in his first full season in charge.A familiar face in the shape of legendary right back, Zedekiah &lsquo;Zico&rsquo; Otieno will join the Brazilian in the dugout after a reshuffle that saw Tom Ogweno and Matthews Ottamax Owino relinquish their positions on the technical bench.It will be a chance for K&rsquo;Ogalo fans to see their new signings, among them KPL player of the year, Kenneth Muguna and Rwandese Jean Baptiste Mugirizaneza. It will also be an opportunity for the record league winners to fire the first salvo against the team that ended their three year stranglehold in the top divison.For Tusker, having already set the bar high by winning the double, they will be looking to keep up to those standards. The quartet of goalkeeper David Okello, Alan Wanga, Humphrey Mieno and James Situma will likely have to make do with a place on the bench having only returned to the country three days ago after featuring for the Sportpesa All Stars in their friendly match against Hull City XI. Should the four not feature in the first eleven chosen by Nsiimbe, Gor will start as favorites despite having not had a competitive fixture to contend with so far, unlike the brewers who played two matches in the disastrous CAF Champions League preliminary round against Port Louis of Mauritius.
