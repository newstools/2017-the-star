Projects funded by the Kerio Valley Development Authority and donors remain suspended until security is restored. Much of the area has been a battle zone A month ago, the authority withdrew staff due to deadly bandit attacks, clan clashes, cattle rustling and property destruction.The KVDA board on Tuesday met in Eldoret to assess the situation and its projects.CEO David Kimosop declined to disclose what was decided.However, the authority has yet to redeploy its staff to the volatile region after withdrawing them a month ago.So far, more than 100 county projects have stalled in Elgeyo Marakwet, Pokot and Baringo counties.More than 100 medical staff and 600 teachers also fled the region, fearing for their safety. Most have not returned.Kimosop said they were unable to proceed with construction of a mango processing factory due to banditry and conflicts between Marakwet clans.&ldquo;We cannot go on with implementation, unless security is restored,&rdquo; he said.Kimosop said they had considered shifting construction of the factory in Arror, Marakwet West.He said KVDA operations had been greatly hampered by insecurity since last year.The authority has been leading peace talks so it can implement projects.Kimosop and political leaders have been holding a series of peace meetings.The leaders include Elgeyo Marakwet Governor Alex Tolgos, Senator Kipchumba Murkomen, Kericho Senator Aaron Cheruiyot and Marakwet West MP William Kisang.&ldquo;We hope the heavy security deployment will enable us to resume our projects where we were forced to stop for a while,&rdquo; Tolgos said on Tuesday.The Kenya Red Cross society has put on hold a Sh300 million irrigation project in Tot, Elgeyo Marakwet, because of insecurity.The death toll continues to rise.More than 75 people have been killed in six months in the Kerio Valley .&ldquo;Insecurity has caused many development activities in Kerio Valley to stall,&rdquo; Murkomen said on Tuesday.&ldquo;But with the latest deployment of KDF and other security agents,we hope things will normalise.&rdquo;The government has deployed more than 2,000 officers from all security teams to p restore order.Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet is expected to visit the region in a week to assess the situation.
