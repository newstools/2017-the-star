Former England manager Roy Hodgson has held secret talks about the Leicester job.It is understood that Hodgson, architect of England&rsquo;s dismal Euro 2016 campaign, met representatives of the Premier League Champions in south-west London last Friday.Hodgson is strongly fancied for the job as Claudio Ranieri&rsquo;s successor in the long term by Leicester&rsquo;s owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha.The Thai businessman, 59, believes he needs somebody with experience to take Leicester forward after this season&rsquo;s disastrous title defence.Hodgson, 70 in August, is keen to return to management but is not yet completely sold on the Leicester idea.It remains likely that interim manager Craig Shakespeare will continue at the helm in the short term after guiding Leicester to an emphatic 3-1 win over Liverpool at the King Power Stadium on Monday night.Shakespeare is expected to be in charge for Leicester&rsquo;s next two games, both at home.They host Hull in the Premier League on Saturday and then try to overturn a 2-1 first-leg deficit against Sevilla in the last 16 of the Champions League on March 14. If things go well under Ranieri&rsquo;s former assistant then he could well be asked to see out the season.Indeed, senior figures at the club such as football director Jon Rudkin would like to see him get the job permanently.However, Hodgson is at the centre of Srivaddhanaprabha&rsquo;s thoughts and it is expected that further talks will take place between the club and the former Liverpool boss over the coming days and weeks.Hodgson said in December: &ldquo;Football is very much in my blood and very much part of my life. I want to be involved. If an offer comes along that I think is the right one for me and for the club, of course I shall be happy to take it.&rdquo;Despite the club&rsquo;s managerial uncertainty, Leicester scouts are busy identifying summer transfer targets, with Basle winger Mohamed Elyounoussi near the top of the list.
