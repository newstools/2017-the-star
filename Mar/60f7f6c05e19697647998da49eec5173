President Uhuru Kenyatta has sent a condolence message to the family and friends of South Africa freedom fighter Ahmed Kathrada (pictured). He said he received the news with dismay and sadness. &ldquo;With our brothers and sisters in South Africa, I mourn the loss of a liberator, and an exemplary leader,&rdquo; Uhuru said.Kathrada was born in 1929, in a country still ruled by British, and in which racial discrimination was an established fact of life.&ldquo;As a young man, he showed the courage he would display all his life, dedicating himself to political activism in defence of the rights of the oppressed,&rdquo; Uhuru said. He said Kathrada gained exposure abroad, and then returned to South Africa, where he was actively involved in the struggle for equality and freedom. &ldquo;That struggle brought him new allies, among them Nelson Mandela, whose friend and companion he became. Together, they were among the defendants at the Rivonia Trial. Together, they were sentenced to life. Together, they spent years in detention on Robben Island,&rdquo; Uhuru said. &ldquo;We remember him as a man of courage; a fighter for the dignity, the equality, and the rights of every African; and as a founding father of the new South Africa.&rdquo;
