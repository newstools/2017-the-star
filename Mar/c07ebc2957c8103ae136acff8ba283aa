Four Jubilee Baringo leaders were on Saturday heckled when they rose to speak at a rally attended by Deputy President William Ruto.They included Governor Benjamin Cheboi, Woman representative Grace Kiptui, MPs Moses Lessonet (Eldama Ravine), and Hellen Sambili (Mogotio).The governor was shouted down by members of the public who are seemingly displeased with his performance for the past four years.They hurled objects at the podium when Cheboi rose to speak, forcing the county boss to cut short his address at Eldama Ravine grounds.Shouts of 'We don't want Cheboi! We want Kiptis!' rent the air as the governor sought to rally the electorate to reelect him."It is okay. Thank you," the governor said when the crowd became uncontrollable. The same was for the MPs.Residents have a feeling that the leaders do not have their interest at heart, and that they have been absent from the ground."We have no issues with Jubilee but these leaders. They are stuck in Nairobi while we are suffering down here," one of them said.Shortage of water, bad roads, poor healthcare systems are among the issues the leaders are said to have ignored.And the ground seems to be shifting under their feet ahead of the Jubilee Party nominations next month.Cheboi's opponent Stanley Kiptis, who has declared his bid to oust the Baringo county boss in August, was praised by the crowd.The Baringo branch Knut secretary general asked Jubilee leaders to ensure the nominations are free, fair and credible."If you read the mood on the ground, it points that we have to ensure the process is clean so that we change the lives of our people," he said.Read: Cheboi shakes rivals in Baringo race, unveils 20 Jubilee branded busesAlso read: Cheboi to face Kiptis and Chebon in Baringo race amid growing Kanu wave Musa Sirma, who is facing Lessonet for Eldama Ravine MP Jubilee ticket, was cheered as he spoke."President Uhuru Kenyatta and Ruto's jubilee administration is good. The only problem is the people surrounding it," he said.Sirma was carried should high by his supporters after the rally. DP Ruto was accompanied by Keiyo South MP Jackson Kiptanui, Water CS Eugene Wamalwa, and PS Prof Fred Segor.At the meeting, Wamalwa told National Super Alliance (NASA) to stop plans of putting up a parallel tallying centre during the August 8 polls."There is no day a player will participate in a game and at the same time be the referee," Wamalwa said, urging the NASA principals to obey the law.Ruto gave 'free advice' to the NASA outfit, asking them to first name its flag bearer and list their manifesto before thinking of winning the elections.He further noted that Jubilee is gaining more strength and popularity as it continues to receive defectors from various parties across the country.The DP urged their supporters in Rift Valley to vote for Jubilee as a bloc, adding that they are ready to work with Kanu and Chama cha Mashinani.The parties are headed by Baringo Senator Gideon Moi and Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto respectively.Ruto exonerated Jubilee from claims of excessive borrowing."In fact, the debts we are paying now were borrowed during past regimes of retired President Daniel Moi and the grand coalition led by Raila Odinga and Mwai Kibaki," he said.
