Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi yesterday told JP to mind its own business and stop peddling lies that NASA is not ready for election. As the ODM and NASA family, we are ready for the election. But we want to know and be assured whether the IEBC is ready to conduct the election, he said.Kingi said JP has panicked and sensed defeat, hence, it makes outrageous claims, adding that even if the poll is conducted today, the opposition is ready.He was addressing International Women s Day celebrations at the Chumani Youth Polytechnic.He repeated NASA s position that the August 8 poll must be free and fair and the IEBC must assure Kenyans it is ready to meet voters expectations. Jubilee should not panic. Let them bring bags, pack files and their properties so that by August, all offices are empty, Kingi said.He said when NASA principal Raila Odinga becomes President, Kenyans will share the meat equally and will not have to salivate. President Kenyatta and a clique are eating meat alone, the county boss said. Only a few people are celebrating. Just swallow saliva for the remaining six months. We shall all eat meat. Kingi accused the Jubilee administration of lying to residents about projects and said JP does not deserve a second term because it is never truthful.He said the JP administration has done little despite having the lion s share of the national cake, adding that it is interested only in Coast s votes.
