The National Treasury plans to spend Sh231.9 billion on development of physical infrastructure in the financial year 2017-18 from July, the budget estimates show.This is Sh88 billion or a 27.51 per cent drop from the Sh319.9 billion in the fiscal year 2016-17 which ends on June 30, largely due to reduced spend on standard gauge railway and roads.The budget for roads has been slashed by Sh12 billion or 8.13 per cent to Sh134.6 billion from Sh147.6 billion. This comprise Sh63.6 billion for ongoing road projects, a marginal 1.27 per cent rise from Sh62.8 billion previously. Budget for foreign financed roads has, however, been trimmed by 19.16 per cent to Sh44.3 billion from Sh54.8 billion.Low-volume road projects have been allocated Sh27 billion down from Sh30 billion in the 2016-17 budget (about 6.7 per cent of which was to be funded through the Equalisation Fund). The opposition, under the National Super Alliance outfit, has bitterly disputed the 7,000 kilometres of road the Jubilee administration insists has been been built in four years.&ldquo;We are challenging the President to show Kenyans the 7000 kilometres of roads it has constructed in the last four years by category, status and region; what class of road, from where to where? The President cannot take routine and periodic maintenance of roads; including the gravelling of earth roads, pothole patching, bush clearing and drainage clearance and report it as an achievement,&rdquo; opposition chief Raila Odinga said a day after President Kenyatta&rsquo;s state of the nation address on March 15.With the construction of the estimated 485 kilometre standard gauge railway from Mombasa to Nairobi in final phase ahead of commissioning in June, the Jubilee administration has shifted focus to the second phase from Nairobi to Naivasha. The Treasury has allocated Sh59.6 billion for the 120km Nairobi-Naivasha SGR line whose total construction cost is estimated at Sh153 billion.The allocation to the Mombasa-Nairobi SGR line has been scaled down to Sh15.5 billion from Sh154 billion donor funds in the 2016-17 budget. Last year&rsquo;s Sh1.5 billion budget for relocation of railway lines at Kibera and Mukuru slums &ndash; a project yet to take off &ndash; has been slashed to Sh400 million.The total railway budget for the 2017-18 has been halved to Sh75.5 billion from Sh155.5 billion estimates in the 2016-17 financial year. About Sh16.7 billion of that has been allocated to development of seaports and airports, largely unchanged from Sh16.8 billion previously.The upgrade of Malindi, Isiolo, Suneka (Kisii) and Lokichogio (Turkana) airports has been given Sh2.6 billion from Sh800 million the previous year. Maintenance of ferries has gotten Sh200 million, a year after Sh500 million was allocated to acquisition of two ferries for the Likoni Channel.The Mombasa Port Development Project has been allocated Sh3.6 billion down from Sh5.5 billion in donor funds last year.The Capital-intensive Lamu Port-South Sudan-Ethiopia-Transport corridor has been given Sh10 billion &ndash; the same amount as last year. The state has been strugling to interest investors with the transport and economic project that will connect Lamu to Ethiopia and South Sudan.
