Heavily armed gunmen stormed Hagadera refugee camp in Dadaab, opened fire indiscriminately and kidnapped three male non-local teachers early yesterday morning.One teacher escaped from the kidnappers and hid in the bush until 6.30am.Residents told the Star the unknown number of gunmen stormed Al-Huda Primary and Secondary schools at 1.30am.Six teachers live in the school compound. It was not confirmed whether the three who were not attacked are local or non-local.Residents said the attackers seemed very familiar with the school layout, and banged on the house doors of the three teachers who were asleep.When the teachers refused to open their doors, the gang broke in and dragged them out.Speaking to the Star on the phone, Northeastern regional coordinator Mohamud Saleh said the gang was not al Shabaab.He said four of the six teachers who live in the schools are accounted for.&ldquo;Only two teachers have not been accounted for. But we have intensified our operations and are optimistic of getting them back. There is no cause for alarm,&rdquo; Saleh said.He said officers are combing the area and exit points at the Kenya-Somalia border in Amuma, Abdi Sugow, Alinjugur, Kulan and Liboi.Saleh said the officers are in contact with officials from the Somali National Army to help rescue the two teachers.Following the attack, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees has suspended activities in the refugee camps and are only involved in life-saving activities such as distribution of food.In April 2015, gunmen believed to be members of al Shabaab kidnapped Judy Mutua, a teacher working with Windle Trust International in one of the schools in Hagadera.She was rescued a week later.Two weeks ago, a teacher at Hilal Primary School in Kambi Hoss, five kilometres from Hagadera camp, survived an attempted kidnap.Her pupils shouted at the gunmen, forcing them to abandon their mission.
