Gor Mahia drew first blood in what will surely be another duel for domestic honors as they pipped Tusker 1-0 to claim the season-ushering Super cup yesterday.Rwandan international Jacques Tuyisenge converted the lone goal from the spot in the 60th minute after Timothy Otieno had been upended in the box. Having been defeated in the same one off match twelve months ago by Bandari, a loss that set the tone for the parting of ways with former coach Frank Nuttal and eventually a trophy less campaign, there was a sense of foreboding for Gor going into this encounter.With the league season set to kick off this weekend, both coaches used the opportunity to blood their new signings in a competitive setting. For K&rsquo;Ogallo reigning footballer of the year Kennedy Muguna and experienced Rwandese midfielder Jean Baptiste Mugirizaneza were among the new faces given a run out while Tusker had in their ranks Marlon Tangauzi, Cercidy Lumumba and Moses Ndawula.Gor were dominant in both halves and could have scored more but for some top drawer goalkeeping from Duncan Ochieng that denied Muguna and substitute George Odhiambo.The win will spur Gor on as they look to right the wrongs of last season which ended with them relinquishing the league title to the brwers who also won the GOTV Shield.For Tusker coach, George Nsiimbe, his start to life with the brewers has began on an inauspiciuos form having also been ousted from the CAF champions league at the prelmanry round.Meanwhile it was a goals galore on the opening weekend of the National Super League as likely contenders for promotion Wazito, Administration Police, Palos and Nakuru All Stars all picked up victories.Wazito saw off a spirited campaign from Talanta to clinch a narrow 1-0 win courtesy of Dennis Gacheru&rsquo;s strike at Camp Toyoyo yesterday.Palos thrashed St. Joseph 3-0 as Mavin Otinya scored twice with John Wanda adding the killer third.The same result went in the favor of Nakuru All Stars who overrun new boys Kibra All Stars.Nakuru are determined to return to the top flight league after being relegated in 2015. Administration Police defeated Bidco United 3-1 while Agrochemicals were held to a 1-1 draw at home to Police.Police had gone in front courtesy of Douglas Wamalwa but Agro responded with a penalty from Emmanuel Kapchanga.The match between Modern Coast Rangers and Nairobi City Stars, planned for yesterday, was called off at the eleventh hour.
