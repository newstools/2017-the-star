Some county assembly speakers in Nyanza and Western have declared their interest to go for elective pots.Some the county officials vied in last year&rsquo;s election and in previous years but lost. Some of them have opted to go for MP and Senate seats, which they consider lucrative. Homa Bay county assembly speaker Samuel Ochillo contested the Kasipul constituency seat in 2007 and 2013 and lost to the incumbent Oyugi Magwanga. He said he is consulting his supporters before going for the seats.&ldquo;I want to go for nothing else than a win this time round. The fact that Magwanga is running for governor leaves that race open,&rdquo; he told the Star in his Homa Bay Town office. In Migori, former assembly speaker Gordon Ogolla, who was impeached, has set his eyes on the county senator seat.The seat is currently held by Wilfred Machage who defected from ODM to Democratic Party. He has said he will run for Kuria West MP. Ogolla said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready to face anybody who is interested in the seat. My candidature is people-driven.&rdquo;In Nyamira, Joash Nyamoko is seeking to unseat North Migiramgo MP Charles Geni.He contested in the last elections on the Kenya National Congress Party and came second. Nyamoko then contested the speaker&rsquo;s seat after Peter King&rsquo;oina was impeached. He will battle it out with Kisii county secretary Johnston Ndege. Bungoma&rsquo;s John Maki has announced he will remove Wafula Wamunyinyi, a member of Ford Kenya, from the Kandunyi parliamentary seat.The speakers who opt to defend their seats include Ann Adul (Kisumu), Dan Kitwa (Vihiga), George Okode (Siaya), Boaz Okoth (Migori), Maurice Buluma (Kakamega) and Kerosi Ondieki(Kisii).Political analyst Jared Okello said the speakers might not have an easy ride in their quest for political seats. He said speakes are seeking elective posts because they are unsure of retaining their posts with the new administration after the elections.
