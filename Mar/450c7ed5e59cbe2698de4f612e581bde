Khalwale is the party's deputy leader."I am extremely happy and proud of this. I will give it my best shot," Onyonka told the Star during a phone interview.The MP accused ODM leaders in Kisii county of planning to rig him out of the April nominations."I have absolutely no outstanding issues with the ODM leader (Raila). My fear is the nominations will not be free and fair," Onyonka said."I am uncomfortable with what is going on in the Kisii government and within ODM circles in the county."The MP tore into branch officials accusing them of victimising him for having previously working closely with Jubilee."Every time I tryto engage ODM and work with them in the county, they say I should go back to Jubilee," he said.Onyonka said his respect for Raila will not waver and that he should be appreciated for the 10 years he marketed ODM in Kisii."I will vote for Raila because I am in NASA. I will campaign for his presidential bid if I have to," he said.The MP was emphatic that his new marriage with Ford Kenya will propel him back to the August House.He said his supporters will vote for him because of his development record, not necessarily because of party affiliations."I worked with Wetang'ula when he was my boss at the Foreign Affairs ministry," he said."I believe my people are clever and reasonable enough to vote for me regardless of the party I go."The legislator was elected on a PDP ticket in the 2007 general election despite a strong ODM wave in the region.Onyonka said Ford Kenya was an alternative to ODM because of its ties to the late Jaramogi Oginga Odinga."The histories of Ford Kenya and ODM are intertwined," he said.
