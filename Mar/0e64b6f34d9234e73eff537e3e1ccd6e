If voters give Governor Evans Kidero a second term, the city will suffer the same fate as Mumias Sugar, governor hopeful Peter Kenneth has warned.&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want Nairobi to be sugar-coated the way Mumias was and when he left it collapsed,&rdquo; he said.Kenneth addressed journalists on Sunday after church in Dagoretti.But Kidero, former Mumias MD, told Kenneth to stick to Nairobi. He said Mumias Sugar Company made a profit of Sh14 billion when he was at the helm.&ldquo;Kenneth was assistant minister of Planning and wrote off billions of shillings of debt owed by tea and coffee industries. He did not do the same to the sugar industry and that is why there are problems,&rdquo; Kidero told the Star on the phone.
