The National Super Alliance yesterday said it will set up a parallel tallying centre for the August 8 poll results.It said the centre will stop the Jubilee administration from rigging.&ldquo;This time, we&rsquo;ll have our tallying centre,&rdquo; Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka said.ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi said, &ldquo;As things stand, we know the electoral body [IEBC] is creating ground for a constitutional crisis. We also know Jubilee is working closely with them so Kenyans vote manually.&rdquo;The leaders did not give details about the centre, but said its victory is in sight as it has the numbers to win the upcoming election. They promised to use all means available to ensure Kenyans use an electronic system.The principals pledged to work together to the end, and urged supporters to be wary of Jubilee propaganda that Kalonzo plans to quit.Kalonzo dismissed the reports, saying, &ldquo;NASA is here to stay. From Masinde Muliro grounds, we&rsquo;ll focus on Central, with our first rally in Thika.&rdquo;&ldquo;The problem facing Mt Kenya are the same problems facing Coast, Nyanza, Western and any other region. We have to work together with all Kenyans to get our country back.&rdquo;ODM leader Raila Odinga said, &ldquo;We came together as leaders to work hand-in-hand with Kenyans. My brother Kalonzo is not going anywhere, despite all that Jubilee is saying.&rdquo;He urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to be honest with Kenyans on his track record, adding that he lied in his State of the Nation address.&ldquo;Kenya has only 500km of tarmac roads done. The figure they are giving us of 10,000km is from here [Nairobi] to Rome,&rdquo; Raila said.&ldquo;He should stop insulting and attacking governors and respect the two levels of government.&rdquo;He told Uhuru to focus on issue-based campaigns &ldquo;as the narrative about the ICC cases can&rsquo;t work in 2017&rdquo;.Raila said those who took part in 2007-08 PEV are well-known to the public and that cannot be rewritten.Musalia said, &ldquo;Kenyans have tasted Jubilee and have seen how they have messed the economy. They are on a borrowing spree, which is going hand-in-hand with the stealing of public resources.&rdquo;Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula criticised Uhuru for disrespecting other leaders.He said the Jubilee administration has failed and urged NASA supporters to turn out in large numbers on Election Day to kick it out.
