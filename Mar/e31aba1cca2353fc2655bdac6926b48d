ODM youths have given the Jubilee administration a five-day ultimatum to stop "harassing" Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho or face protests.Youth leader John Ketora said Joho's woes were tiring and frustrating."We are not happy at all," he told the media at Orange House on Wednesday. "[The government] should stop intimidating Joho or there will be countrywide demonstrations."Ketora said they cannot allow the harassment to continue as the constitution provides for freedom of expression.He added that the government should not use power to harass leaders and intimidate citizens who do not subscribe to certain ideologies.&ldquo;The DCI, Knec and others have been turned into tribal institutions to harass and intimidate Opposition leaders,&rdquo; he said.Read: DCI summons Joho to record statement over forged exam slip claimsAlso see: [VIDEO] 'Fire for fire': Politicians, youths cause frenzy, march to DCI with JohoSonu chairman Babu Owino asked the government to stop using state organs to harass governors. &ldquo;Very soon you will hear them declaring Joho not Kenyan and you will not be surprised,&rdquo; he said.Owino said Kenyan&rsquo;s resolve to send President Uhuru Kenyatta and the Jubilee administration home was unstoppable. &ldquo;They may use all means within their power to try and stop this but this won&rsquo;t change Kenyans&rsquo; resolve,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;We shall not watch while our leaders are harassed and distracted from discharging their duties.
