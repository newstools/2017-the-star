President Uhuru Kenyatta is expected to issue 88,000 title deeds to Trans Nzoia landowners during his tour which starts on Wednesday. It is the first time Uhuru is visiting Trans Nzoia as President since his election on March 4, 2013. The ownership documents have been prepared by the national government and funded by the Trans Nzoia administration, which paid land rates to the Ministry of Lands on behalf of the residents. The title deeds are part of the 150,000 titles to be issued at the end of the National Titling Programme. Governor Patrick khaemba has welcomed the President and is optimistic he will also help to solve problems affecting residents. “I have severally asked the President to allocate the county government part of the forest and prison land in Kitale to expand the town which is currently congested. I hope he will respond,” Khaemba said. The county government also wants the national government to give it part of ADC land to build a university. Some leaders have, however, criticised Uhuru for neglecting the county since he became President. His visit comes amid wrangles on how to share seats among Jubilee leaders.
