Marsabit Governor Ukur Yattani has ditched the opposition and pledged to back President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s reelection.He joined the Frontier Alliance Party, which he supports the President&rsquo;s bid. Four MPs, 25 MCAs and more than 300 elders representing the 15 communities living in the county accompanied Yattani yesterday to State House, Nairobi, where they met Uhuru. The MPs were Roba Duba (Moyale), Chachu Ganya (North Horr), Nasra Ibrahim (woman representative) and Joseph Lekuton (Laisamis). Lekuton left before the meeting started to attend to an urgent matter. Ganya, Nasra and Lekuton belonged to ODM.Yattani becomes the latest in the list of governors and senior politicians to defect from the opposition to rally behind Uhuru.&ldquo;We have decided to leave the opposition because the people of Marsabit are grateful for the work you have done for us, including construction of roads,&rdquo; he said. Yattani said the journey from Moyale to Nairobi that used to take four days now takes six or seven hours because it has been tarmacked. &ldquo;Now there is a bus that travels from Mombasa to Addis Ababa through Moyale. This is one of the reasons the people of Marsabit will all vote for you,&rdquo; the county boss said.Yattani said there will be competition for all elective positions at the county level, but there is unanimity among residents that their choice for the top seat is Uhuru. The President welcomed their decision and said he will work together with them.
