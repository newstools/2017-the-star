China has given Kenya a Sh2.25 million grant for food to mitigate the effects of drought.Treasury and the Chinese Embassy signed exchange of notes for humanitarian assistance in Nairobi on Monday.Under the deal, China will supply 21,000 metric tonnes of rice, a shipment expected to arrive in three weeks.Treasury CS Henry Rotich said the government has been taking short term measures to address the food crisis.This includes mobilising funds through expenditure reprioritisation to meet the cost of importing maize and other foodstuff and supplying water to the drier parts of the country.&ldquo;However, the challenge is daunting and our budgetary resources are not adequate. This grant will therefore go a long way towards supplementing government efforts towards addressing the challenge,&rdquo; Rotich said during the signing.Read: Drought used to hit once in a decade, now it haunts Kenyans every yearAlso read: Treasury has not withheld cash to fight drought, says PSRotich noted that Kenya is facing an unprecedented shortfall of the major food commodities, maize in particular.He said at the signing that approximately three million people in both urban and rural areas are at risk of severe hunger.&ldquo;Indeed, because of not getting adequate food, children less than five years, expectant and lactating mothers are highly vulnerable to malnutrition,&rdquo; he CS said.China ambassador to Kenya Liu Xianfa said they were pushing for Kenya to receive the rise as soon as possible.China is among the leading donors to Kenya with a cumulative official development assistance of Sh727.822 billion.
