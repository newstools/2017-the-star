Police in Nairobi and other parts of the country have started getting decent houses as part of the government&rsquo;s efforts to provide better accommodation for the disciplined forces.Housing and Urban Development PS Aidah Munano last week handed over 100 houses to police officers at Kamulu station.The houses are part of the Sh2.4 billion housing programme for the Kenya Police, Administration Police and prison warders across the country.About 1,850 houses will be built under the programme.The Administration Police Training College in Embakasi and the Directorate of Criminal Investigations Training School in South C are some of the facilities in Nairobi where decent houses will be built.Others are Garsen police station in Taita Taveta, the Presidential Escort in Ruiru, the Eldoret Airport and GSU Recce in Ruiru.Others are the Kajiado AP camp, Emali AP camp in Makueni, Garissa, Ruiru Prison in Kiambu, Bungoma police station and Kamiti Maximum Prison. The PS said 1,000 houses are near completion and would be handed over next month.He said another 800 houses will be ready by the end of April. &ldquo;The government is committed to improving the housing conditions of all members of the disciplined forces,&rdquo; Bucha said.In November, the PS handed over 100 units to Migosi police station in Kisumu.Housing secretary Ibrahim Hussein and assistant commissioner of police Noor Gubow, who accompanied the PS, said construction of a further 5,000 housing units will begin in the next financial year.&ldquo;The new houses will boost the morale of police officers, who for a long time have endured infringement of their privacy due to shortage of houses,&rdquo; Gabow said.He said 10,000 officers are expected to join the service next month, hence the need for houses.The government aims to build 100,000 houses for the officers. In February last year, a parliamentary committee ordered the Interior ministry to audit all police housing units to root out unauthorised occupants.This followed reports some officers were renting out their official residences to members of the public, then renting cheaper houses outside their official quarters.The Public Accounts Committee said it had reliable information some police quarters were housing members of the public, frustrating the government&rsquo;s plans to bridge the shortage of police houses.
