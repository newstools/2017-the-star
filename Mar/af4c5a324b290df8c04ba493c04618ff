Pokot herders in Baringo county say they have lost more than 5,000 livestock for lack ofpasture, a week after they were forcibly evicted from grazing areas in Baringo North and Baringo South subcounties.Last month, the government banned the cross-border grazing and ordered more than 3,000 Pokots to go back to Tiaty subcounty.This followed deadly bandit attacks and cattle rusting.The Pokots were herding and watering their livestock in Arabal, Rugus, Mukutani, Chebinyiny, Sirata, Komolion, Orus Ng elecha and Noosukro in Baringo South and Kagir, Yatya, Chemoe, Natan, Kapngetio and Chepkesin in Baringo North.The pastoralists returned to Paka, Akwichatis, Churo, Tangulbei, Ameyan, Chesitet, Ripko and Silale in Tiaty."Since I drove back my 150 animals from Arabal in Baringo South, I have lost a half of them in a week," Dodonyang Sawel told the Star at Ameyan, Tiaty subcounty, on Saturday.Nabori said dogs are satisfied and no longer eat the carcasses. He said he fears the remaining animals will also die for lack of pasture and water."This is the worst drought experienced in this part of Kenya," Nabori said, adding that he doesn't know what will happen to him, his family and children because livestock is their source of livelihood.Another herder Nepeitole Korwawa said he has so lost 40 cows and 60 goats since he drove them back from Natan and Kagir in Baringo North subcounty."Initially I sold three cows to buy some 200 bales of hay but now it is not enough to feed the 300 heads of cattle. They are now dying in threes and fives daily," he said.The Star counted many carcasses in the bush and emaciated cows trying to drink water from drying up rivers.Korwawa urged the government to buy the emaciated animals to reduce the number of those dying.Women and girls fetch dirty water from shallow holes in River Ameyan, which is drying up.Kenya Red Cross visited the area to supply maize flour, cowpeas, oil and salt to feed 3,300 hungry residents in Baringo North, South and Tiaty on Saturday.Red-cross official Noah Said noted that the previous target of hunger victims were 1,500 before shooting up to over 3000 due to prolonged drought.Apart from distributing food, needy families are receiving Sh3,000 cash transfer.KRC distributed food in Moinonin in Baringo North and Ameyan in Tiaty.
