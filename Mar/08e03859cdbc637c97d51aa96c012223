Abuse of alcohol and drugs is on the rise in parts of the North Rift due intensified political campaigns, Kikuyu elders have said.Kikuyu Council of Elders chairman in Eldoret, Kabari wa Kamunu, said many aspirants have been buying alcohol for the youth or dishing out money which the youth use to buy drugs.He said the government should continue fighting illicit alcohol. Our youth are drunk in most places throughout the day. Many of them have stopped working and just go to market centres to wait for aspirants, Kamunu said.Many political leaders are using the alcohol and cash to influence youth to vote for them, he said.Kamunu said many young people may suffer serious effects of alcohol and drugs to the extent that they will not be able to vote during the nominations and election.The politicians buying too much alcohol for youth should instead channel the money to community projects, he said. We have asked the county government and other government agencies to step up the crackdown on illicit alcohol and drugs, especially as we head to the elections, Kamunu said.Uasin Gishu county commissioner Abdi Hassan said they have received reports on the increase in sale and manufacture of illicit alcohol in some parts of the region and police have been directed to act. The law will not spare anyone because of politics and those found engaging in the business of illicit alcohol or drugs will be rounded up, he said.Hassan said they would work with the elders to ensure they educate young peopel on the dangers of alcohol and drug abuse.
