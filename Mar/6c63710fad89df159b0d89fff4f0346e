The state has allocated Sh1.3 billion for the training of students in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics in technical training institutions to address the severe skills shortage in Kenya.This is in addition to the Sh6 billion proposed allocation to the Technical Training Institutions in the 2017-18 budget estimates.Currently, 80 per cent of students studying in universities pursue courses linked to humanities and social sciences, whereas, only 20 per cent are in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics courses.Speaking in Nairobi, Education CS Fred Matiang'i, said there was need to balance the ratio of artisans, technicians and professionals in appropriate fields. We have many people trained in areas we don t have jobs for, and have jobs in which we lack skilled manpower, he said.Matiang'i also registered his disappointment over the conversion of middle-level training institutions into universities, saying this had created a mismatch between training and industry needs. Kenya is importing welders when it has the capacity to train such experts in its technical training institutions, he said.He said the government is now shifting its policy by putting more resources into STEM.The system introduced in March 2016 saw the government allocate more than Sh600 million to the Higher Education Loans Board to fund students pursuing courses in technical training institutions.Currently, more than 40,000 students in these institutions have applied for financial support from HELB. For a country to realise Vision 2030, there was need to increase the number of students taking Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics courses, the CS said.
