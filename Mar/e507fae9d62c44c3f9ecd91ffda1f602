Nepal dented Kenya&rsquo;s hopes of qualifying for the 2019 ICC World Cup after beating them by seven wickets yesterday at Tribhuvan University International cricket ground, Kirtipur.After bowling out the side, coached Thomas Odoyo, for 155, the home team needed only 30.2 overs&mdash;and a loss of three wickets to overhaul the 156-run target. The hosts rode on superb batting from Gyanendra Malla (64 not out) and Dipen Airee (62) to subject Kenya to their fifth loss in 10 matches.Coming into the match at the backdrop of Saturday&rsquo;s six-wicket win in the first match, Kenya batsmen struggled with the spin, losing 30 runs for six runs. The hosts started the chase on a sour note, losing Sunil Dhamala (1) and Sagar Pun (5) to stand at 14 for 2 after 3.4 overs. However, Malla and Airee laid a solid foundation for the chase, putting up 111 runs for the third wicket before the latter was sent back to the pavilion on lbw by Collins Obuya in the 28th over.Incoming batsman Sharad Vesawkar (24) then forged a 35-run partnership with Malla to help Nepal get past the finish line with 116 balls to spare. Nepal&rsquo;s bowlers led by Vesawkar&rsquo;s four-for, choked Kenya&rsquo;s batting with some economical bowling before the hosts overcame an early stutter courtesy two early wickets from Elijah Otieno to eventually canter home with 118 balls to spare.After being sent in to bat, Kenya lost opener Alex Obanda and Dhiren Gondaria in the fourth over before a 79-run third wicket-stand between Irfan Karim (38) and Obuya (48) took them close to the 100-run mark. While the duo stemmed the fall of wickets, their partnership also took up 140 balls. Both batsmen fell in quick succession following tight bowling from Mohaboob Alam (7-5-11-2), Sagar Pun (7-0-19-1) and Vesawkar.This saw Kenya fall from 151 for 6 to 155 all out in the 47th over. Obuya&rsquo;s inning that lasted 78 balls included seven boundaries. It ended in the 28th over when he was stumped with Kenya on 93 for 3. Karim faced 77 balls on his way to 38 including three boundaries before falling to Vesawkar in the 31st over with the board at 107.Skipper Rakep Patel and Karan Kaul looked to revive Kenya&rsquo;s surge but their partnership lasted only six overs before Patel was send back to the pavilion on 21 runs.Gurdeep Singh played a poor shot to become the sixth wicket on two with only six added between him and Kaul.Kaul and Nehemiah Odhiambo added on 20 for the seventh before Kaul was bowled by Vesawkar on 14. From there, Kenya went on to post 155 all out from what looked like a comfortable score of 93 for 3.
