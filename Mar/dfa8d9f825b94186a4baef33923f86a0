Construction of a key road linking Kenya and Tanzania through the Isebania border is set to start in the next two months. This is after Kenha signed an agreement with a Chinese contractor to rehabilitate the 170-kilometre Isebania-Kisii-Ahero stretch. The Sh18 billion project which will be jointly funded by the African Development Bank and the government. It will be executed by China Henan International Corporation Group in two phases and includes some 36-kilometre feeder roads. The Isebania-Kisii road will be built in phase one at Sh8.6 billion while Kisii-Ahero junction will be built in the second phase at Sh9.4 billion. Eng Erastus Mwongera, Kenha chairman, said the road will open up the region for business. "The road will enhance trade in the lake region," Mwongera said. The Suneka-Rangwe-Orare, Nyachenge-Tabaka-Ogembo, Nyamataro loop road - all in Kisii - are among the feeder roads set to be upgraded. This is envisioned to put the Kisii's Suneka airstrip to good use. The facility has low traffic owing to the state of roads in the area. "The upgrade will include footpaths, climbing lanes, road signages, footbridges, an overpass and upgrading of the Rongo weighbridge," he said. The Kenya National Highways Authority seeks to use the weighbridge to regulate the axle load limits allowed on the said road. Mwongera further pointed out that they will construct an emergency care unit center at the Nyabondo mission hospital. "We will create market stalls and other roadside amenities to increase opportunities for residents to trade in the region," he said.
