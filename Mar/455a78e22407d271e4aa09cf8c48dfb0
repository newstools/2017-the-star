Kenya will launch its highly anticipated national TB survey this month to help plan prevention and tackle deaths as a result of tuberculosis.It is currently among the seven countries in Africa that have a high TB prevalence, the others being Ethiopia, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda, Zimbabwe and Zambia. These collectively account for 650,000 cases annually.Wilfred Nkhoma, WHO Africa medical officer in charge of Hepatitis, HIV, Malaria and TB care, said these countries need to ensure they reduce tuberculosis incidences and deaths by 95 per cent by 2030.&ldquo;Although Africa has about 13 per cent of the world&rsquo;s population, the region contributes about 26 per cent of the global TB burden. Sixteen of the 30 high TB-burden countries are in Africa,&rdquo; he said.Enos Masini, head of the National Tuberculosis, Leprosy and Lung Disease programme, said despite Kenya's inclusion in countries with a high TB burden, a lot of progress has been made in the fight against TB.&ldquo;We record about 80,000 cases annually. We have also ensured that those who test positive for TB are put on treatment to avert deaths as result of TB,&rdquo; he said.Masini said the data, which is still being validated, will provide critical information on what needs to be done to ensure the country reduces the TB deaths and cases recorded annually.LOW CURE RATESThe government will roll out a shorter regimen for persons who have been diagnosed with multi-drug resistance from first of July.This adoption comes a year after the World Health Organisation rolled out new guidelines on diagnosing and treating patients who have been identified to have multi drug resistance TB in May last year. Those who will be put on this regimen will be on treatment for a period of between 9&ndash;12 months.Currently those who are suffering from multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) are on 20-month medication.According to the World Health Organisation, the conventional treatment regimens, which take 18&ndash;24 months to complete, yield low cure rates.Patients find it very hard to keep taking second-line drugs, which can be quite toxic, for prolonged periods of time. Therefore, they often stop treatment or are lost to follow-ups in health services.Close to 600 people have MDR-TB in Kenya.Those who are at risk of drug-resistant TB include: those who do not complete their drugs, those who skip medication, or those who live in a region with high incidences of drug-resistant TB.However, Masini said that those still taking medication under this regimen will not be affected.&ldquo;It makes sense to do that because if a person was diagnosed in MDR-TB in March, by the time we get to July, he would have already done three months of his treatment. So it will make no sense to change his regimen as his body has already gotten used to the medication he was prescribed for by the doctor,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;A lot of planning is required to start that regimen. One needs to do drug safety monitoring to establish whether they have any side-effects on the patient. One also needs to change the tests that ought to be done.&rdquo;The shorter regimen is recommended for patients diagnosed with uncomplicated MDR-TB, for example, those individuals whose MDR-TB is not resistant to the most important drugs used to treat MDR-TB that are commonly known as &ldquo;second-line drugs&rdquo;.It is also recommended for individuals who have not yet been treated with second-line drugs. HIGH DEATH TOLLEliud Wandwalo, senior disease coordinator for TB for the Global Fund in Geneva, urged countries that have high TB burden to continue collecting data on their countries' prevalence, which will go a long way in ensuring that funds given to them by the Global Fund are well utilised.&ldquo;It is sad that some countries get money but cannot use it wisely," he said. In 2015, Stop TB Partnership Kenya estimated that at least 21,900 people die every year of TB, while 100,000 get infected.
