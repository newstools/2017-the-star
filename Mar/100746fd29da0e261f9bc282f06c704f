The ability of politicians to control the news agenda at the expense of other matters of national importance is worrisome.A good recent illustration of this is the news coverage of the ongoing strike by medical practitioners and dentists versus the coverage of the voter listing campaigns led by President Uhuru Kenyatta and opposition leader Raila Odinga.The voter listing drive was easily at the top of the news agenda, leaving the doctors&rsquo; strike, which has disrupted provision of services in public health facilities for more than 90 days, playing second fiddle.Despite the gravity of the breakdown of services in public health facilities, the news media somehow gave the voter registration campaign more prominence.As a result, Kenyans have not thought about the shutdown of the public healthcare system with the gravity that it deserves. Instead, they considered voter listing as important, perhaps even more important than the doctors&rsquo; strike.The majority of Kenyans access healthcare services from public health facilities. This means that the impact of the doctors&rsquo; strike is real for many of us. On the other hand, very few to none of our politicians access healthcare services from public health facilities. They have generous taxpayer-funded health insurance that enables them to access private healthcare in Kenya and abroad.The political class&rsquo;s topmost priority is the upcoming election, not matters of public interest.As we head closer to the general election, the political class will no doubt continue to distract Kenyans from the sorry state of public service provision.The news media must guard against that and instead keep the discourse focussed on the real issues that affect Kenyans.A study published by Pew Research Center in November 2016 showed that Kenyans are more concerned about public service delivery than anything else. The war on corruption, runaway crime, poor healthcare, lack of clean drinking water, poor infrastructure and rundown schools all featured in the top 10 concerns for Kenyans surveyed in the study. All these are public service delivery concerns.It is therefore important that the news media make coverage of politicians&rsquo; proposals on improving public service delivery the issue at the front and centre of the political discourse this election season. Not whatever distractions politicians will conjure up from time to time to keep the nation&rsquo;s attention diverted.Nine out of 10 Kenyans get their news and information from the news media. More importantly, Kenyans trust the information they get from the media.The news media must not betray this trust by focusing on the priorities of the political class this election season. If the news media do not keep the public service delivery agenda at the top of the news agenda this election season, then that would be a betrayal.Kenya&rsquo;s news media must take back control of the news agenda from politicians and make public service delivery the central political issue of the 2017 election, not the political distractions served by politicians.
