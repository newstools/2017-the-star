Until two weeks ago from 2005, William Kandie, a teacher at Kasiela Primary School in Baringo South subcounty, was living peacefully with his family before armed Pokot bandits robbed him of all his happiness.Kandie lives in Chemorongion, 50km south of Marigat town, where he used to commute every day to and from school.He taught 125 pupils, hoping they would one day grow up to become dependable people in the society. Kandie put together his scheme of work, ready to finish the syllabus early to prepare his 12 class eight candidates to write their KCPE later this year.Suddenly, all hell broke lose."Pokot bandits attacked on Sunday, killing my colleague Philemon Kipkemoi, a teacher at Kapndasu Primary School."Three days later, Atiar Primary School teacher Daniel Kangogo was killed at Chepkesin in Baringo North subcounty. On Thursday, Knut Baringo executive secretary Joshua Cheptarus ordered the immediate closure of the schools after three more people, including a teacher, were shot dead on Tuesday at Chepkesin in Baringo North subcounty.More than 30 schools have been closed down in Baringo county due to ongoing attacks by armed Pokot bandits. &ldquo;It is so sad that even before we bury the teacher that was killed the other day at Kapndasum in Baringo South, another one is killed,&rdquo; Cheptarus said, adding that teachers, parents and pupils should be moved to safer grounds.Cheptarus told the media in Kabarnet town on Tuesday that: &ldquo;We cannot stare as security officers armed with guns flee the banditry zones while our poor teachers having only chalks and pens are left behind.&rdquo;The affected schools include Early Childhood Development centres, primary and secondary schools, some of which have been turned into temporary shelters for the victims.WOMAN, BABY KILLEDThe death toll has hit 10 people, including Pokot politicians Kibet Cheretei (Loyamorok MCA) and Parliamentary aspirant Pepe Kitambaaa, who were killed at a Marigat restaurant last Saturday. On Sunday, the Pokot bandits killed a breastfeeding woman with her three-day-old child at Natan before stealing some 300 heads of cattle.The woman, Josephine Kiptoon, was among hundreds of residents attempting to flee the battlefields at Yatya, Kagir and Natan in Baringo North subcounty, where the bandits opened fire at 2pm that lasted for six hours.Earlier on, they shot and injured another lactating mother of one at Chemorongion village in Baringo South. She is now recuperating at a Nakuru hospital, while a caretaker looks over her three-month-old child.Kandie said since the attack on his school, he has not stepped into class. Instead, he has put on his warrior-like gear and joined the Kenya Police Reservists and police officers in an attempt to repulse the surge of more than 300 Pokot militia.The Star met the teacher on Tuesday at Chemorongion centre when a group of Red Cross officers in a convoy visited the area to assess the situation.He said his simple poison-tipped arrows cannot scare away bandits armed with AK47 rifles.As he spoke to the media, serial gunshots rang from some eight kilometres away, implying the bandits were striking again.However, a resident said the earth-shattering sound was from an armoured personnel carrier being used by the GSU officers to fight the heavily armed bandits, who had already surrounded over 100 cattle and were ready to flee with them.&ldquo;We have not had peace or slept for one week since bandits attacked on Sunday,&rdquo; Kandie said, adding that they have already stolen over 3,000 heads of cattle, injured several people, torched houses and displaced over 10,000 people in Baringo North and South subcounties. To add to his depression, he said his family, including his wife who has been running a kiosk and a posho mill at Chemorongion centre, have joined over 2,000 residents camped with children at Nyimbei Primary School.&ldquo;We need to be told if we are in Kenya or not,&rdquo; Kandie said, urging the government to either help quell the attacks or supply them with guns to face the armed bandits head-on.HUMANITARIAN DISASTERMore than 5,000 displaced victims of ongoing banditry attacks in Baringo county are now appealing for urgent humanitarian help.It is getting to the fifth day today since the armed Pokot bandits opened fire on residents before setting their houses on fire in parts of Baringo North and South subcounties since Saturday.The IDPs are in dire need of foodstuff, water, shelter and clothing.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where my three other children are,&rdquo; Gladys Sokome cried as she boarded a Red Cross vehicle at Chebinyiny, Baringo South, on Tuesday.&ldquo;Here I am only holding my one-month-old child as I flee to an unknown destination, fearing for my life.&rdquo;She said the bandits started attacking then since 6am in the morning and &ldquo;we have since been lying hungry in the bush without taking anything for breakfast and lunch&rdquo; she said as she alighted to join a group of some 2,000 displaced victims now camping at Nyimbei Primary School.She said she left many of her belongings behind, including her child's clothes, which she saw going up in flames after the bandits set her house on fire.The homeless people, including newborn babies and schoolchildren, are now spending their nights in the cold as they watch and hear their youth, KPR and police officers exchange fire with the bandits at a close distance.Kandie said eight other schools have been closed, including Nyimbei, Chebinyiny, Arabal, Chemorongion, Sinoni, Kapkechir and Tuyotich primary and seconday schools. He said the bandits also vandalised and stole equipment at Kapndasim and Embosos dispensaries.The displaced Baringo North people are now camping with their children and livestock in Kapkomon, Rondinin, Sibilo and Tebengar. Over 800 other IDPs are camping in Mochongoi and Kabel in Baringo South.GOVERNMENT RESPONSE"Tell us if we are in Jubilee government or not," Baringo Governor Benjamin Cheboi asked as he joined to grieve with the victims on Tuesday.Cheboi condemned the killings, saying Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery and Inspector General Joseph Boinnet should urgently visit the victims and supply a surveillance chopper to trace the bandits in their hideouts.On Tuesday, the government declared 19 administrative locations as disturbed and dangerous: Arabal, Kiserian, Mochongoi, Rugus, Mukutani, Chebinyiny, Komolion, Chepkalacha, Makutano, Paka, Orus, Loiywat, Silale, Nando, Tangulbei, Chepkererat, Kipnai, Ng&rsquo;oron and Amaya.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want any jokes. I would like to see every child, woman and man sleep in their houses in peace,&rdquo; Deputy President William Ruto said.The announcement paved the way for the deployment of 381 security officers, including 230 Administration Police officers and 151 Kenya Police Reservists, to flush out the bandits and illegal herders.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want anybody found holding illegal firearms to regret the step the government is going to take,&rdquo; Rift Valley regional coordinator Wanyama Musiambo said.He gave the bandits a three-day ultimatum to stop the raids or the government would take tough measures to restore peace and sanity in the county.Baringo MCAs issued statement on Monday demanding the immediate arrest of Speaker William Kamket and Tiaty MP Asman Kamama and that they be charged with incitement.They asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to intervene in the Baringo attacks if jubilee is to be re-elected in the August 8 elections, &ldquo;because we don&rsquo;t see people voting if the trend escalates until August&rdquo;.On Thursday, Baringo residents threatened to boycott Deputy President William Ruto visit, saying instead they will attend the burial of their beloved ones killed by armed Pokot bandits amid ongoing attacks.More than 1,000 residents, including 300 teachers, protested in Marigat, led by Cheptarus. They declined to welcome DP Ruto to the county saying his visit will not make any impact.Cheptarus said instead of waiting to listen to Ruto&rsquo;s speech in the county, the people are going to bury teacher Kipkemoi.&ldquo;With this extent of violence, we are expecting President Uhuru Kenyatta himself to come and address the serious life-taking issues, but not his deputy,&rdquo; Cheptarus said.Cheptarus said residents have already lost hope with the Jubilee government. Therefore, it will take the "heart and the spirit of the President himself" to come and restore the trust of the Baringo residents.&ldquo;We cannot continue burying our people every day," Cheptarus said. "We need to be told if the government is defeated to disarm the Pokots then to allow the entire residents of Baringo, including teachers, to have their own guns so they can protect themselves.&rdquo;The protest was held amid Devolution CS Mwangi Kiunjuri&rsquo;s visit to the county to deliver foodstuff to the hunger-stricken victims of Baringo North, South and Tiaty subcounties.County commissioner Peter Okwanyo urged residents to remain calm as the government tries to arrest the situation.&ldquo;We are going to use force to drive back all the Pokots grazing their animals across the borders of Baringo North and South,&rdquo; he said, adding that the bandits were attacking the Tugen and Ilchamus pastoral communities.He said the government is committed to providing enough foodstuff and water to the victims of hunger.
