The recent string of defections from ODM has given the Jubilee Party impetus to woo voters from Nyanza and Western.JP will use a two-pronged approach to woo voters. First, defectors will be expected to campaign aggressively for the party.Second, public servants have also been sucked into the campaign drive, even though they are not supposed to participate in politics.The Kisii defectors are Senator Chris Obure, Simon Ogari (Bomachoge Chache MP) and Mary Otara (woman representative).JP will focus on wooing voters in Bungoma, Busia, Kakamega, Kisii, parts of Migori, Nyamira and Vihiga.President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto have made many visits to the counties and launched various projects.Kisumu, Homa Bay and Siaya counties - ODM strongholds - have been left out.Obure is spearheading Uhuru&rsquo;s reelection campaigns in the region. He will run for governor.The senator led ODM campaigns in Kisii in 2013. On the NASA side, Governor James Ongwae, Kitutu Chache South MP Richard Onyonka and nominated Senator Janet Ong&rsquo;era are leading campaigns.JP branch interim secretary Sam Nyangeso said, &ldquo;Jubilee will not only rely on defector politicians to deliver. There are other players like us who are not seeking elective seats.&rdquo;The former Kenya National Library Services board chairman expressed confidence Jubilee will get more votes in the county than in 2013.Public servants, led by Education CS Fred Matiang&rsquo;i, will also carry out in campaigns.Matiang&rsquo;i has held several meetings in Kisii, urging residents to vote for Uhuru.Political analyst David Omato said Jubilee&rsquo;s popularity in Kisii has improved thanks to the defectors&rsquo; efforts.&ldquo;Jubilee can get more than 40 per cent of votes in Kisii, but in Nyamira, they face an arduous task. Obure has been on the ground since he defected holding meetings with various stakeholders, but in Nyamira nothing is happening,&rdquo; he said.Omato said some defectors jumped ship for selfish reasons.Waluke leads western campaigns In Western, Sirisia MP John Waluke has become the JP point man after decamping from ODM.The former ODM branch chairman said, &ldquo;We ditched ODM for the government so our people can also have projects launched.&rdquo;Waluke said Sirisia had been neglected until he became cordial with Jubilee, leading to the tarmacking of the Chwele&ndash;Lwakhaka road and the launch of a Sh100 million water project.Once a close ally of ODM leader Raila Odinga, Waluke is known for his aggressiveness and networks in Bungoma county.He has hosted Ruto in the county three times in two months. During the 2007 election, Waluke gave NASA co-principal Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula a run for his money in the race for Sirisia MP. Wetang&rsquo;ula won by a small margin.Analysts say Waluke&rsquo;s aggressiveness has given the rest of the Western team more energy to campaign for Uhuru.Speaking to the Star on the phone, analyst Philip Wanyonyi said before Waluke&rsquo;s defection, Jubilee did not have an energetic figure to help popularise it alongside Bungoma Governor Kenneth Lusaka.&ldquo;Ever since Waluke joined the team, he has been at the forefront, organising rallies and stakeholder meetings,&rdquo; he said.Wanyonyi said Waluke would find it hard to remain relevant if either of NASA co-principals Musalia Mudavadi or Wetang&rsquo;ula are picked as the presidential flagbearers.&ldquo;It would become very difficult for Jubilee in the region, and Waluke could become a victim of circumstances,&rdquo; he said.Waluke has said he could consider joining NASA if Wetang&rsquo;ula or Musalia is picked the flagbearer.NASA has pulled in crowds in Jubilee strongholds. Residents flocked to the alliance&rsquo;s rallies in Meru and Tharaka Nithi counties two weeks ago.
