The drama involving President Uhuru Kenyatta and Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho is turning ugly. Both the President of the Republic and the chief executive of the county need to respect each other&rsquo;s office. Madly adversarial party politics should not seep into an occasion such as the recommissioning of the Mtongwe Ferry yesterday.President Kenyatta clearly feels that Governor Joho is stalking him and he yesterday warned him to stop interfering in presidential eventsThe national government repaired the ferry and the county government built the road and installed the lights that go right up to the ferry. It was undemocratic to stop the leader of Mombasa from celebrating something his government contributed to.It is true presidential functions should not be disrupted, particularly in an age of terrorism. At the same time, Joho is basking in the reflected glory of all the media (including social media) attention that he is grabbing.In a way President Kenyatta has fallen into Joho&rsquo;s trap.
