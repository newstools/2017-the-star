The troubled Mumias Sugar Company is likely to record a further loss compared to the loss it posted last financial year.In a profit warning announcement appearing in the local dailies on Tuesday, the giant sugar miller says the projected loss this year would rise to Sh5.90 billion for the year ending June 30, 2017.In the financial year ending June 30, 2016, it recorded Sh4.73 billion loss, while in the 2014-15 year it recorded Sh4.64 billion loss.The government has in the last four years disbursed Sh3.1 billion towards revival of the company operations.The firm is still struggling to repay Sh11 billion debt, derailing revival efforts.The dismal performance has been attributed to the scarcity of raw materials leading to the factory being underutilised. This has led to a high cost of production.
