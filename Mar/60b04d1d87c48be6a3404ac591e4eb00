Schools should adopt modern building designs and international best practices to improve the Kenyan education system, experts have said.They are Michael McGuire and Eric Karsh from Canada, Ray Zlinsi from the Aga Khan Academy Mombasa and Hemed Mukui from KenCada International School in Mombasa.Many Kenyan schools, especially public schools, were built in the pre-colonial and post-Independence period. These designs are outdated and are not good for the learning environment for 21st century students, they said.McGuire, with over 25 years of education experience, partnered with Hemed to establish the KenCada International School in Utange, Mombasa, in 2014.The school offers the Kenyan 8-4-4 system with an international approach.
