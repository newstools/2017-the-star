The electoral commission is asking the High Court to dismiss a case seeking to force political parties to comply with the two-thirds gender rule during nomination of candidates for elective positions.The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission says it does not have powers to obligate political parties to stick to law, which requires them to implement two-thirds gender rule in their nomination for the position of MPs and senators.The commission says that though it has been given the mandate to regulate the process through which parties nominate candidates for election, there is no law to guide it on how the two-thirds gender rule implementation can be realised.And as a result, it wants the suit by Katiba Institute, which is championing for the rights of marginalised, be dismissed.The case was filed by Katiba Institute and it seeks orders against IEBC.Katiba Institute holds the view that IEBC is by law prohibited from accepting a list from a political party that fails to meet the requirements of the two-thirds gender rule.The court was told that the matters in the petition is of great public interest as it affects the nature of democracy and concerns the need to ensure that political parties do not directly or indirectly participate in violation of principles of the Constitution for gender equity.The Institute and its boss Prof Yash Pal Ghai want the case referred to the Chief Justice for constitution of a bench to hear it because it raises weighty issues.Particularly it asks whether a declaration should be issued requiring all political parties to ensure that the list of nominees they present to IEBC for elective positions of MP for the 290 seats and the 47 seats in senate for the general election must meet the two-third gender rule.Also it asks the court to consider issuing a declaration that the IEBC is constitutionally duty-bound to reject any nomination list from a political party for its candidates for 2017 election for MPs which in its totality does not meet the two-thirds gender composition.The IEBC has already set out the timelines for the nomination process indicating March 23 as the date when political parties must submit names of candidates for party primaries.
