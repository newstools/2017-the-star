The youths attacked him, tearing his shirt and trousers to get the cash from him.&ldquo;MCA aspirant anatupatia mia moja, pia governor aspirant atupe mia na anataka tuandamane? ( An MCA aspirant gives us Sh100. How can a governor aspirant give us the same amount and expect us to march singing slogans?)&rdquo; one youth said.Ndambiri was rescued by his security personnel and hidden in the boot of a Toyota Probox belonging to his ally, then his convoy sped off. When the Star tried to talk to him, he said he would call back but he did not. Ndambiri did not return SMSs.Waiguru was dealt a major blow on Friday when more than 700 of her supporters decamped to Governor Joseph Ndathi&rsquo;s camp.
