Tourism stakeholders have renewed calls to the four coastal counties to enact laws and regulations to guide management and operations of businesses along the beach. Mombasa, Kwale, Kilifi and Lamu, which share the 200 nautical miles of the Kenyan Indian Ocean, do not have legal structures on management of the beach. Kenya Association of Hotelkeepers and Caterers executive director for Coast Sam Ikwaye on Monday said the issue of managing the beaches has remained unresolved for years. &ldquo;Several issues at the beach including harassment of tourists, insecurity, conflicts among beach operators reduce the attractiveness of beaches,&rdquo; said Ikwaye. Kwale County Assembly has come up with the Beach Management Bill, which is expected to be passed within the next two weeks, according to the MCAs. &ldquo;We have received suggestions from the stakeholders and are going to make the changes,&rdquo; Mwanamisi Ali, an MCA at the Kwale County Assembly, said. &ldquo;We are having three months to the end of the term, but we are hopeful that this Beach Management Bill will be enacted in the next two weeks.&rdquo;Changes proposed by KAHC include removal of the clause touching on fishing management and establishment of a beach management levy. &ldquo;The fund will help the county government establish modern infrastructure along the beaches for the beach operators,&rdquo; Ikwaye said.He said the Bill should also recognize the beach access roads. &ldquo;We should have beach access roads recognized in the legislations to curb the conflict which has always been arising between beach users and private property owners along the beach,&rdquo; said Ikwaye.
