Education CS Fred Matiang&rsquo;i has been ordered to draft a memo ordering public schools to respect SDA students&rsquo; right to worship.In a judgment by justices Milton Makhandia, William Ouko and Kathurima M&rsquo;Inoti, the trio set aside the previous High Court verdict that ruled that the freedom of worship for SDA students is not violated if the schools they attend do not allow them to follow the church&rsquo;s beliefs and practices.Yesterday&rsquo;s ruling was read out by Appeal court judge Sankale ole Kantai on the trio&rsquo;s behalf. The ruling arose out of a case filed by the Seventh Day Adventist Church East Africa Ltd complaining on behalf of students of the faith.In its suit papers, the church sought orders to exempt SDA students from classes, exams and cleaning on Friday evenings and Saturday to enable them to worship.It listed more than 20 public schools, among them Alliance Boys High School, accusing them of suspending SDA students over failure to attend Saturday classes.The schools, the church said, violate the freedom of SDA students to worship.The church also complained of bullying and discrimination against SDA students. Pastor Samuel Makori urged the court to intervene and uphold the rights of SDA students.
