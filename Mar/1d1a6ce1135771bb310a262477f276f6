Top security chiefs yesterday slammed MPs&rsquo; plea for youths with standard eight certificates and students who scored below a D+ in the KCSE exam be recruited into the police service.Interior PS Karanja Kibicho and Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet (pictured) told the National Assembly Committee on Administration and National Security it would be dangerous to lower the minimum entry grade and recruit standard eight leavers at a time when the service is trying to redeem its lost image through reforms.The committee chairman Asman Kamama (Tiaty) and his deputy Alois Lentoimaga (Samburu North) argued the service is losing many officers because recruits who attained minimum university entry grades are pursuing degrees after joining the force and quit upon completing their studies. Lentoimaga asked the security chiefs to consider hiring standard eight leavers and form four graduates with lower grades in the government&rsquo;s programme of recruiting 10,000 police officers annually, because the recruits have a passion for the job and it is easy to retain them in the service.&ldquo;Many young people due to poverty and joblessness out there are being recruited in the police service, yet they have no interest in the job. They get money, enroll for degrees and leave.You recruit to have officers retained in the force,&rdquo; Lentoimaga said.Youths between 18 and 28 years must have a minimum of D+ in the KCSE exam to be recruited into the force.
