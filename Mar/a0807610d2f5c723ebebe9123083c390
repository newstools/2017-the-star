Pokot witch doctors defying the government have said ranch invasions in Laikipia should continue because police are too weak to fight them.At a gathering of armed Pokot militias on Nyasore dam in Laikipia North on Wednesday, five bulls were slaughtered in a witchcraft ceremony.Soothsayers were then brought in to 'read' the entrails of the butchered animals to determine the future.The mgangas said the invaders should not worry about government askaris as "they would not be able to fight them" and that they should all "go back and finish the grass..."Pokot invaders have been sacrificing buffalo for witchcraft spells to protect themselves from police.Macabre photos emerged of the animals poached by invaders on private ranches and conservancies in Laikipia North.The attackers, who are usually heavily armed, claim the buffalo are killed and only strips of skin, horn, testicles and noses removed for use in casting witchcraft spells.More on this: Pokot invaders now killing Laikipia buffalo, cutting parts for witchcraftSince Sunday's murder of rancher Tristan Voorspuy on Sosian, thousands of invader cattle had been moving out of farms expecting action from police.But officers have yet to evict invaders this week in line with directives from DP William Ruto and Interior CS Nkaissery this week.On Wednesday night, 60 big herds of Pokot cattle re-invaded Suyian ranch where 67,000 Samburu cattle were already trespassing.Farmers have disputed Nkaissery's claim that the authorities have 'cleared' 16 ranches of invaders in ongoing operations."That is fake news or what they call in America 'alternative facts'. The invaders with the guns continue to charge in and out of private farms whenever they wish," said a local farmer.Read: Voice from the grave: Tristan Voorspuy puts Laikipia invasions into perspectiveAlso read: Britain urges Kenya to restore order in Laikipia after rancher killed
