Former national holders Kenya Prisons (women) and General Service Unit are the winners of the Kenya Volleyball Challenge Cup staged at Kamukunji grounds, Nyeri yesterday.Both clubs had to impress their employers early enough after finishing second at the 2016 playoffs.Kenya Prisons rebounded from a set down against Kenya Commercial Bank to seize their first crown of the year in a five-set thriller, whereas GSU clubbed the Kenya Defense Forces&rsquo; Ulinzi to win the men&rsquo;s cup.The bankers were the first to hit their opponents, bagging the opening set 22-25 but the Prisons regrouped and won the second and third sessions 25-17, 25-17 to gain a 2-1 lead. With average efforts, KCB snatched the fourth set 19-25 from the five-time African winners but Prisons outclassed them in the rally round, thrashing the bankers 15-6 to win 3-2.KCB defeated Tetu Girls 3-0 (25-12, 25-18, 25-7) in the semis as Kenya Prisons thoroughly hammered Mt. Kenya University 3-0 (25-10, 25-4, 25-10) in the other.It was an entertaining, cut-throat clash between the police and military in the finals where GSU had to live up to their ego over the soldiers, while KDF needed to substantiate their worth in their backyard. With the inspiration of 2016 best attacker Cornelius Kiplagat and outside hitter Boniffenry Mukekhe, GSU clobbered KDF 3-1 (25-18, 24-26, 27-25, 25-22).On their way to winning the title, GSU reproduced a 3-0 result against Mombasa Prisons within three days by beating the warders in sets of 25-13,25-21and 25-17. Also in a repeat of the league match, the Kenya Defence Forces fired Forest Rangers 3-0 (2512,25-10,25-18) to set a date with Police side GSU.
