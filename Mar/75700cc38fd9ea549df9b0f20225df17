Despite their strike, doctors at Kenyatta National Hospital have been responding to distress calls and treating patients in critical condition.A nurse at the hospital who spoke on condition of anonymity told the Star this has been happening since the strike started on December 5 last year.&ldquo;The management has on several occasions called doctors to attend to severe cases and they have been responding positively,&rdquo; she said.Doctors at the facility have performed several surgeries.&ldquo;We have have had operations done here though they never want it to go public,&rdquo; she added.The Kenya Defence Force doctors who were deployed to the hospital last year have been attending to patients at the casualty section, but they don&rsquo;t follow up in the wards.&ldquo;We are the ones who monitor the patients and if we realise one is in need of a doctor&rsquo;s attention we inform the management who go ahead to contact doctors.&rdquo;Today marks the 96th day since doctors walked off the job, demanding recognition and full implementation of a 2013 CBA. The government calls it illegal and unsustainable.Negotiations with the government have hit a dead end. The government has withdrawn its latest Sh14 billion offer and said again that striking doctors would be fired.
