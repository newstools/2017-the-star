The Kenya Livestock Marketing Council has accused the government of using the plight of Garissa livestock farmers to pull publicity stunts.The government, through the Kenya Meat Commission, launched an offtake programme on January 11 to cushion livestock farmers from drought.KMC commissioner Hassan Jelle, who oversaw the launch, said the government would inject Sh170 million into the first phase.A total of 1,200 cattle were to be bought from six constituencies. Each was given 200 slots.Despite this pledge, nothing has taken place.KLMC chairman Dubat Amey yesterday said the programme has not picked up as anticipated since its launch in Garissa town.He further expressed outrage that livestock owners whose 30 cattle were slaughtered during the launch have not been paid two months later. This is most disheartening, Amey said.Farmers hard-hit by the current drought were happy that the programme would help them dispose of their emaciated livestock, instead of losing them.Amey, who addressed the press in Garissa town, wants the government to honour its promise. He was accompanied by other officials. &ldquo;We are under pressure from frustrated livestock farmers in remote areas calling to enquire about the off-take programme and when the near-death animals will be purchased,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;We have no answers to these questions because we are in the dark. Let the government come out clear on what is going on.&rdquo;A KMC senior official, who sought anonymity, acknowledged that the programme has not gone as anticipated.Speaking on the phone, he cited financial problems as their undoing. The official also confirmed that owners of the 30 cattle have yet to be paid.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true we have not done much since we launched the programme. But we are expecting funds in the next one or two weeks,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;We shall settle with the livestock owners and kick off the second phase.&rdquo;During the launch, the government, through the commission, urged pastoralists with emaciated livestock to take advantage of the programme.
