MPs on Thursday night secretly approved a landmark law that paves the way for anyone with a D-minus to enrol for a degree course.In the late night conclave, soon after Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich had presented his Sh2.6 trillion Budget estimates, they unanimously passed the University Education (Amendment) 2017 Bill, which now clears the way for any Tom, Dick and Harry to have a college degree.The Bill &ndash; sponsored by Education Committee boss Sabina Chege &ndash; lowers the minimum university entry grade from C+ to D- to raise the number of students locked out of university by the strict high standards.The session, attended by less than 100 MPs, was not gazetted as required of extraordinary sessions held outside the official parliamentary business hours between 9am-6.30pm. Some ODM MPs, conscious of the travails of Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho, readily backed the Bill. MPs claimed the Bill was crucial and would help many Kenyans locked out of university education to access higher education with no hustle.All the MPs present supported the change with uncharacteristic enthusiasm. The new law was hurriedly rushed through all the three stages without public participation.With every clause where they needed it, the papers were rushed to State House for President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s approval, despite objections from Speaker Justin Muturi and majority leader Aden Duale. Both held the view the change was unconstitutional. Some MPs pushed ahead, and, ignoring all protocol, drove in a convoy of Toyota Prados and delivered the papers to State House.Uhuru was still behind his desk when the bundle arrived. He has been agonising on whether to append his signature or kick the stuff back to the MPs &ndash; with amendments.
