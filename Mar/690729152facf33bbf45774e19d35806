Eveready East Africa has told a court that Energizer PLC failed to disclose important information in contract renewal negotiations, leading to massive losses.Eveready, a Kenyan company, terminated its near half-a-century distribution agreement with Energizer in December 2016, saying the deal was tilted in favour of the American firm.Eveready has sued Energizer at the commercial court in Nairobi seeking to block it from continuing to distribute its products in Kenya until the case is concluded.Eveready&rsquo;s lawyer Andrew Musangi told Justice Joseph Ongutu on Monday that Energizer employed unethical and underhand methods to award the distribution agreement to another company, Hasbah Kenya Limited.Musangi said last year, Energizer controlled 90 per cent of Eveready business, nominated two members to the Eveready board, and has had a say on the senior management of the firm since inception.&ldquo;Because of the control, Energizer, like a director, therefore owed a fiduciary duty to the company to act in its best interest and not engage in self dealing under the corporate opportunity doctrine,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The duty is aimed at preventing a controlling shareholder from perpetrating a fraud against the minority shareholders.&rdquo;Energizer, in its replying affidavit by director Paul Scott, said the distributorship agreement was initially for three years, and would thereafter continue for one year unless either of the parties issues a notice to terminate it. Scott said there was no exclusivity clause in the deal.&ldquo;It is therefore perplexing that the plaintiff is now looking to establish a claim, based on rights it claims accrued to it from the dealings with the defendant before the agreement was executed,&rdquo; Scott said. &ldquo;The terms of the agreement were therefore conclusive regarding its rights and duties as distributor of Energizer products. The plaintiff&rsquo;s current claims are therefore disingenuous and unfounded.&rdquo; Energizer wants the case dismissed.Eveready managing director Jackson Mutua told a press briefing in Nairobi, when he announced the termination of the deal with Energizer on December 22, that the firm&rsquo;s new range of batteries will largely be manufactured in China and marketed under the Turbo brand.&ldquo;The Turbo will include portable flashlights, light bulbs and car batteries,&rdquo; he had said. Mutua said the new brand is expected to support the company&rsquo;s diversification agenda, adding the growth in sales has nearly been stagnant in the past two years.The Energizer supply contract, Mutua had said, had been restrictive and they will instead introduce their own dry cell brand and have control of the supply chain.
