A women leaders' meeting was marred by chaos on Friday after one of them began campaigning for Jubilee Party.Trouble started when Gender PS Zeinab Hussein asked the women to back President Uhuru Kenyatta's second term bid.The PS was shouted down by a section of the women when she asked those affiliated to Jubilee to ululate.The group was angry that the meeting, held under the banner of 'Ni Mama', was being turned into a vote-hunting ground.It took the intervention of Narc Kenya leader Martha Karua to restore peace and order.She condemned the clash and urged the women who were still trying to settle to "avoid tribal disagreements".The meeting was aimed at getting more women elected in August 8 poll.Kisumu Deputy Governor Ruth Odinga, former Judiciary Chief Registrar Gladys Shollei and legislators Zipporah Kittony and Alice Wahome were among those who attended.
