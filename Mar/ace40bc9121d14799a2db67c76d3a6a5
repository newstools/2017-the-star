Senate Health committee chairman Wilfred Machage, the senator from Migori, was right when he yesterday described the national government s withdrawal of a Sh14.5 billion offer to the strike doctors as drastic.Making it clear that he did not agree with the strikers uncompromising stand, he called on government to give them a second chance and reconsider the withdrawal of the offer.On Wednesday, Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Union secretary general Ouma Oluga spoke of a near-solution to the stalemate that is now in its 96th day and described the cancellation of the government offer as a hurdle .KMPDU has urged that the doctors be given a second chance to resolve the issue.The doctors may not be paid as well as MPs, but they are paid more than most middle class Kenyans earn and they should pursue a compromise that enables them to return to work and alleviate the mass suffering across Kenya.President Kenyatta needs to reinstate the offer and meet the medics halfway.
