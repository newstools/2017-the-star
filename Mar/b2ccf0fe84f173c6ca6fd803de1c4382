The NGOs&rsquo; council yesterday accused Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho and his Turkana counterpart Josphat Nanok of provoking President Uhuru Kenyatta in unnecessary show of power. Chairman Stephen Cheboi blamed Joho, Nanok and other leaders for attempting to demean the President, but also cautioned Uhuru against engaging his critics in unguarded exchanges. &ldquo;We condemn any disrespectful utterances between some leaders [governors] and the head of state at public meetings. Reckless utterances among leaders are not healthy for the nation,&rdquo; Cheboi said.
