Budalang&rsquo;i MP Ababu Namwamba on Friday rebuked his critics, saying they will not succeed in bringing down the Labour Party of Kenya.Speaking in Eldoret, the MP said he is still in charge of the party and accused ODM of trying to smear him.&ldquo;Let me clear the air as an LPK leader. There are no factions in our party. We know what is happening &mdash; some people are being used to disrupt our activities,&rdquo; Namwamba said.&ldquo;Those behind it are being used by my former party ODM. They can&rsquo;t succeed in their dirty game. We moved on a long time ago and they should accept it. I cannot get embroiled in juvenile antics with political amateurs who are barking for their master. I will ignore the barking dogs and go straight to their owner and deal with it.&rdquo;He said LPK is confident the party will win seats in the general election.LPK has 100 aspirants for various seats countrywide, Ababu said.&ldquo;Our agenda is making the party popular and listing candidates. We will not concentrate on sideshows,&rdquo; Namwamba said.He spoke on the second day of his North Rift tour to promote the party.On Tuesday, Namwamba was suspended from carrying out business for LPK. The decision by the Political Parties Tribunal followed an application by LPK member John Makokha.Makokha says Ababu is still a member of ODM and annexed minutes of the party&rsquo;s NEC on February 10. Ababu&rsquo;s chairmanship of the meeting infringed upon his membership rights, Makokha said.He said Ababu was illegally trying to form alliances with other parties, though he was not an LPK member.Labour Party chair Julia Ojiambosaid on Tuesday said the petition was not sanctioned. A party statement said, &ldquo;LPK has full confidence in Hon Ababu Namwamba and attempts to misuse the good name of our party and besmirch the character of our leaders deserve contempt.&rdquo;
