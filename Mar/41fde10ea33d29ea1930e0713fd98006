NASA wants the IEBC to disclose details of its contract with a French firm that is to deliver elections management technology for the August 8 poll.It says the IEBC has yet to make known the cost of the tender with Safran Identity &amp; Security.&ldquo;We have a lot of integrity issues with the company. For free and credible elections, the IEBC must come clean to the taxpayer,&rdquo; principal Musalia Mudavadi said in an interview with the Star on the phone.The electoral agency last week terminated the Kenya Integrated Elections Management System tender awarded to Gemalto. It cited budget constraints and said it would go for direct procurement.&ldquo;Kenyans are asking questions and the IEBC must respond by telling us how much has been paid, and what their expectations and terms of reference are,&rdquo; Mudavadi said.&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want anyone to change the election date, but the poll must be credible, free and fair.&rdquo;He said Safran (previously Morpho) was fined $630,000 by a French court in 2012 for bribing public officials in Nigeria to win a contract in 2000-03.Mudavadi said the firm lacks the high moral ground to be engaged by the IEBC.He said, &ldquo;The same firm was hired by the IEBC in 2013 and all the gadgets failed. Kenyans were forced to go back to manual voting.&rdquo;
