The water shortage in Mwingi town has forced residents to buy water from traders, some of whom fetch the commodity from streams through which sewage passes. The traders are making a killing charging exorbitant prices.Residents said there is no water in any of the eight kiosks in Mwingi. Yesterday, trader Kithuku Kimanzi said he draws water from River Tyaa, a kilometre away from Mwingi. He said some traders fetch water from streams near the Mwingi mortuary.&ldquo;Its unfortunate residents buy water whose source they don&rsquo;t know. Before you buy water from a stranger, ask him to drink it so you know it is safe,&rdquo; Kimanzi said. Some residents have complained the water sold has a bad smell and cannot be used for cooking.
