Government spokesman Eric Kiraithe on Saturday asked the media to help calm political tension and promote peace ahead of the August polls.He urged the media to move away from the habit of marking some areas as hotspots, adding that this will avoid whipping up emotions.The spokesman said peoples&rsquo; behaviour is determined by the information they get for which the media plays a key role in passing the same."You have a great role to play in ensuring that the process we shall go through is peaceful and that there is social and economic stability in the country," Kiraithe said.Kiraithe told journalists in Mombasa that sensational reporting is not only a recipe for chaos but also scares away investors and tourists."The minute we start implying and spreading information showing that we are unstable, then we are killing the future on this nation," he said."This country is ours after August 8. What Kenyans want is an opportunity to improve their status."He said this will not be achieved if the media is either complacent or fail to actively take part in ensuring that there is no violence in the country.Read: We won&rsquo;t let media houses relay parallel election results to avoid violence - CAAlso read: Media regulator disputes CA directive on election coverageKiraithe also assured Kenyans that police will provide security during the ODM's rally in Mombasa on Sunday.He, however, warned politicians against hiring goons to disrupt their opponents&rsquo; meetings saying those found culpable will be dealt with accordingly."When we catch up with you, don&rsquo;t try to hide behind your political party or candidacy," he said.Kiraithe similarly sounded a warning to the general public to keep off political rallies of politicians whose ideologies they don&rsquo;t agree with.He said this will be a sure way to avoid creating scenarios for violent clashes."You don&rsquo;t need to attend meetings to create riots. Keep off meetings of leaders you don&rsquo;t like," Kiraithe said.He allayed fears that the ruling coalition might use police officers to intimidate opponents during the electioneering period."I have not seen any signs or symptoms that the Jubilee administration is keen on using police officers," he said.Kiraithe pointed out that officers who won't execute their duties impartially will have a date with the law.He said any misconduct will be investigated by the Police Oversight Authority and the officers concerned held accountable.The spokesman made the comments even as police in Mombasa cancelled the Jubilee rally planned to counter ODM's.County commander Peterson Maelo said they had not been notified of the meeting which was to be held 4 kilometers away from the ODM event.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
