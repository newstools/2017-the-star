Across all political parties, most aspirants are giving voters a lot of money from undisclosed sources, with the express purpose of buying leadership solely for selfish or enrichment reasons.With the banning of Harambees in which aspirants used to bribe voters to elect them, giving handouts during the campaign period, as many are doing right now, is bribery and illegal and those who engage in it should be indicted and barred from vying for any positions of elected leadership.But bribing voters is happening despite the law banning it and President Uhuru Kenyatta pleading that campaigns should not be guided by money and negative ethnicity but by &ndash; sera &ndash; ideology, policies and party manifestos, which should also be built upon political ideologies.Without ever saying so, aspirants who bribe voters to buy leadership, do so because they have no policy or vision other than self interest and cannot disclose they bribe for self gain and enrichment.Tragically, where bribing of voters is happening, the people involved are mainly the poorest of the poor and desperate youths who only pay attention to money and none to policy, or even to ideology meant for their liberation. Consequently, when hungry voters elect leaders, it is not the best but the worst choices. Their perpetual enslavement continues.Indeed, when the poor elect bad leaders into power, they endorse their own enslavement and oppression after poverty has made them blind to their interests and liberation, or after making them believe their oppression and exploitation are inevitable and must be endured.It is after poverty has succeeded in making the poor insensitive to their misery that what Julius Nyerere said becomes eminently true, &ldquo;Poverty corrupts, and absolute poverty corrupts absolutely.&rdquo;But bribing poor voters is not only bad because it lands them in the hands of leaders whose rule can only make them poorer. It is bad because voters end up electing leaders who are against any change that could save them from poverty. Indeed, this could very well be why, despite boasting of change, since Independence and multiparty democracy, our poor continue to increase in numbers and get poorer.Aspirants pretend the small cash they give to voters to influence their voting is not bribery but generosity, except that it is only given and demanded during election time. And, by the way, feasting voters or buying them with handouts is no generosity. It is bribery that no democracy should permit or allow, and which we have never seen in the US, the UK, Germany or other advanced democracies.Speaking frankly, when voters elect those who give them money, they are selling leadership to them and when aspirants seduce voters with bribes, it is buying leadership and they will subsequently use those positions to make themselves rich by impoverishing the voters who are powerless and defenceless.Aspirants do not buy leadership ever to serve voters. It is to serve and enrich themselves at the expense of voters, who must dearly pay for whatever services they might get from them such as tenders for government business or helping their sons and daughters get jobs with the police, army or ministries.Unfortunately, even as voters in other countries do the exact opposite by raising money for candidates whom they believe they need in leadership, selling leadership by voters and buying leadership by aspirants has become a most negative culture in Kenya. Indeed, it is the culture that will eventually destroy Kenya.Compared with other countries, selling and buying leadership is a tragedy that would never have allowed Barack Obama of America to become president without tons and tons of money with which to bribe voters who in America made small contributions to help put Obama into the presidency.Yet selling and buying leadership is committing suicide by Kenyan voters, who know once the deal between them and their leaders &mdash; to whom they have sold leadership &mdash; is done, each will go their different ways because there is nothing more left between them. Indeed, the next election is the next time they will meet to transact similar business with similar consequences for both parties.Again selling and buying leadership should be avoided like leprosy because it does not only make a farce of our politics, but it also greatly subverts our economy, which only allows development of leaders while completely undermining development of voters who never ask for their progress to be part of a contract between themselves and the leaders they have sold leadership to.
