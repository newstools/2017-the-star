After criticisms for blocking Governor Hassan Joho from attending the Mtongwe Ferry relaunch in Mombasa, President Uhuru Kenyatta on Sunday sought to absolve himself from blame that he hates opposition governors.He invited Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero to address golfers at an event that marked the end of the 49th Kenya Open at the Muthaiga Golf Club.&ldquo;I had to allow Kidero to speak because after Mombasa, people might say I do not allow governors to speak in this country,&rdquo; the President was quoted by his press team.The Presidential Strategic Communications Unit sent out the dispatch separate from what they had prepared from the event.To emphasise the significance of the Kidero address, the unit said other senior government officials were not accorded similar treatment by Uhuru.Joho was blocked from attending a presidential function a few weeks ago.In what was a growing public spat between them, Uhuru told the county boss to &ldquo;stop following me around like I am your wife.&rdquo;The President was criticised for the action, with NASA principal Raila Odinga saying he is &ldquo;a bully in need of our prayers.&rdquo; But Uhuru has dismissed this, saying he does not have anger problems, adding that he was just out to tell people the truth.The President also sparked public outrage after his outburst while on a tour of the Turkana county.He is alleged to have snapped at Governor Joseph Nanok for demanding a better method for sharing oil revenue between the national government and the county.
