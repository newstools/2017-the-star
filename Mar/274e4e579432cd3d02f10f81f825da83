Eastleigh hawkers yesterday complained they were ordered to move into a derelict building on an overgrown plot opposite Pumwani Maternity Hospital.&ldquo;There were no documents to show permission to occupy the land. Hawkers who ventured into the land were chased away by violent street urchins who have occupied the dilapidated house and land,&rdquo; Jeff Oteba said. He is chairman of the Eastleigh Hawkers&rsquo; Association.The hawkers were ordered to relocate after mall owners complained they inconvenience motorists and pedestrians and block mall entrances.But Oteba said each hawker pays Sh50 daily revenue to City Hall officials, despite being illegal street vendors. A court on Monday ordered the hawkers off Eastleigh streets. Police have moved in to enforce the directive.
