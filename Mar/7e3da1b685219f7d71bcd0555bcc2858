President Uhuru Kenyatta has urged Kenyans to shun politicians who have vested interests in spreading hatred and violence.The President, who spoke when he presided over the graduation of 1,991 General Service Unit officers at the GSU Training School in Embakasi, said the police bear a bigger responsibilityto ensure inciters do not set Kenyans against each other. We must spurn their ideology and stand fi rm against their advances. We must be vigilant to keep the sparks of reckless rhetoric - of hate speech and idle talk - from evolving into furiousfires of political violence.That is a burden we all bear, but it weighs especially heavy on you, Uhuru said.He said experience worldwide shows it is only secure, stable nations that have succeeded in achieving and sustaining shared prosperity. Our Vision 2030 will remain a mere dream unless we secure our nation. We have to cultivate trust and confi dence of our inventors, both domestic and foreign, if our economy isto continue to grow rapidly and create the jobs we badly need for our youth, he said.Uhuru said Kenya has made significant progress since the 2007-08 post-election violence, which was caused by politicians with vested interests in violence.
