The prime suspect in the killing of Laikipia rancher Tristan Voorspuy failed to be formally charged with murder yesterday after the state asked for more time to complete investigations.Samson Lokayi will be detained at Nyahururu police station for seven days.Earlier, principal magistrate Waititu Gichimu referred the case of Lokayi to the High Court in Nanyuki for direction. The suspect is alleged to have killed Voorspuy on March 5 at Sossian ranch and arrested three days later.The prosecution says the initial investigations show the suspect was involved in the murder and is also alleged to have set ablaze three cottages in the ranch.The suspect was charged in court two weeks ago and had been remanded at the Nanyuki police station as police continued with investigations.Lokayi appeared before Nanyuki judge Mary Kasango, where the state was expected to charge him with murder of the co-owner of Sosian Ranch.The prosecution filed an application seeking 10 more days to enable them complete investigations.&ldquo;The investigators are yet to complete their work on the matter and I am applying to have the suspect detained. It will also give time to the investigators to take the suspect for a psychiatric examination,&rdquo; principal state counsel Lucas Tanui said.Lokayi, through lawyer Maobe Maotsetung, opposed further detention, arguing that police had two weeks to complete their investigations. &ldquo;Continued detention of the suspect is violation of his constitutional rights. He has been in police custody since his arrest on March 10 and there is no justification in the prosecution asking for more time to do what they should have done,&rdquo; Maotsetung argued.In her ruling, Kasango said the accused is facing serious charges and there is a need to accord time to the prosecution to prepare adequately. However, she said she could not grant the 10 days requested by the prosecution but would allow police to hold him for seven days. Voorspuy&rsquo;s widow Lucinda was in court and was accompanied by family lawyer Amaan Kassam.The accused only understands his native Pokot language and the court had to hire an interpreter.Two weeks ago, senior resident magistrate Evans Ngigi granted the order to the police to continue holding the suspect.Police noted that Lokoyi had no known permanent resident and releasing him on bond was not advisable. A week earlier, Laikipia North MP Mathew Lempurkel was released on Sh200,000 bail as police also sought to have him held for 14 days in connection with the murder.The court however declined to have the MP held but ordered that he be visiting the Laikipia East DCIO office three times a week.Lempurkel had been charged in the same court with incitement and the case is still ongoing.
