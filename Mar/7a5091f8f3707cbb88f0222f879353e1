Jose Mourinho has likened Manchester United&rsquo;s chances of signing Neymar to the &lsquo;impossible&rsquo; task of breaking into a safe.United are admirers of the Brazilian and would be keen to add him to their arsenal at Old Trafford but Mourinho claimed such a move would be &lsquo;impossible&rsquo;.The Red Devils boss insisted that Barca would have no intention of allowing one of their prized assets to leave the Nou Camp.&ldquo;I always try to be objective and pragmatic with the clubs and ask the clubs for what can be given to me. Neymar is absurd,&rdquo; said Mourinho. &ldquo;A club like Barcelona cannot and will not lose Neymar.&ldquo;Although Messi is still a young player with years to go, he is already 30, and Neymar will be the great player of Barcelona after Messi. I think (trying to sign him is like) going to try to break into a safe, impossible.&rdquo;Recently, Spanish newspaper Sport claimed United would be willing to activate the &pound;173m (Sh22bn) release clause written into the Brazilian&rsquo;s contract to bring him to the Premier League.On top of the huge fee they would give Barca, the paper suggested United are also willing to pay Neymar &pound;416,000 (Sh53m)-a-week to make the switch to England.Last week, Neymar admitted he admired a number of Premier League sides - including United.&ldquo;The Premier League is a championship that amazes me,&rdquo; Neymar said. &ldquo;I like the playing style and the teams. And who knows, someday, I would like to play at it, yes.&rdquo;&ldquo;I admire Manchester United, Chelsea, Arsenal, Liverpool &mdash; these are the teams that are always there fighting. And then you have high-level coaches like Mourinho and Guardiola. These are coaches with whom any player would like to work.&rdquo;Meanwhile, Zlatan Ibrahimovic has dropped a heavy hint that he will remain at Manchester United next season.The Sweden international says he &lsquo;never leaves a job unfinished&rsquo; having previously vowed to win a Premier League with the club who are very unlikely to do so this season.Ibrahimovic, 35, has an option on his &pound;250,000 (S32m)-a-week contract for another year at Old Trafford.It is yet to be triggered but the club&rsquo;s leading scorer appears set to remain in Manchester.&ldquo;I enjoy it,&rdquo; Ibrahimovic, who will complete a three-match ban against West Bromwich Albion tomorrow, said of his time at United so far.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a person when I go into something I put my head 200 per cent, and I do what I&rsquo;m good at. I go in, I go for the kill and I go out. And when I go out there is no complaints, that&rsquo;s what I do. I never leave a job unfinished.&rdquo;&ldquo;I always go in, do my job, and in the way that is a fair play, a fair deal, that is what I do.&rdquo;
