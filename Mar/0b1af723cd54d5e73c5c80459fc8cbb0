Three Cabinet Secretaries and an MP yesterday faulted the opposition for spreading lies and propaganda against the Jubilee Government.They are CSs Fred Matiang i (Education), Mwangi Kiunjuri (Devolution) and Charles Keter (Energy) and Nyaribari Chache MP Richard Tong i.They spoke on Sunday in Nyambera, Kisii, during a special offering in aid of Kisii Town Parish Catholic Church.They said President Uhuru Kenyatta s administration has implemented many development projects but the opposition does not recognise them. They cannot be standing on platforms cheating Kenyans. It is good for them to speak the truth, Matiang'i said.Kiunjuri said the Kisii community should learn from history where they and the Kikuyu community have been working together since President Jomo Kenyatta's administration.He urged the faithful to support Uhuru's reelection bid because he has the interest of Kenyans at heart. Some guys in the opposition are engaging in politics that has been passed by events. We should dwell on politics of development, Kiunjuri said.Keter told the leaders to stop provoking the President in his meetings and instead organise theirs. He [Uhuru] has a right to react on the same, he said.During the special offering the CSs gave Sh500,000 each to help in the ongoing construction of a modern church.
