Sh2 million property was destroyed on Tuesday night when fire gutted the famous Pork Centre Butchery in Uthiru, Kabete constituency, along the Nairobi-Nakuru highway.Proprietor Mukiri Gitau said the source of the 8pm fire is not known. Speaking at the scene yesterday, he said his 25 staff screamed for help as customers ran away. Residents responded and helped put out the fire, Gitau said. Uthiru MCA Ndiba Thande said they called firefighters who responded swiftly and assisted residents before the fire spread to adjacent structures. &ldquo;I was in Naivasha when residents informed me there was fire at the butchery. I called firefighters to intervene,&rdquo; he said.Residents urged the Kiambu county government to station fire engines near villages, trading centres and estates so they can respond in time whenever there is a fire.Trader Ann Njeri said they fear more losses if firefighters are not stationed nearby. Gitau said he will have to move quickly to rebuild the structure to avoid losing his customers, who are mainly residents and motorists.
