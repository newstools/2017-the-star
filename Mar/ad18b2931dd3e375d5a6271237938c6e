The African Centre for Women, Information and Communications Technology has launched a programme &ndash; Vusha &ndash; for young women to undertake vocational training. Vusha targets women living and working on Lake Victoria and those from Nairobi slums.&ldquo;We are targeting girls from poor background who cannot afford fees to continue with their education after primary school,&rdquo; programme manager Boniface Onyango said.&ldquo;The young women are in transition from school to work life. Due to lack of white collar jobs, we have decided to train them in fields mostly dominated by men, to make it easy for them to get jobs,&rdquo; Onyango said. He said the training is free of charge and candidates will be vetted before enrollment. Young women have enrolled in numbers. &ldquo;People laughed at me, thinking I didn&rsquo;t know what I was doing when I chose to pursue the course,&rdquo; said Lilian Wanjiru, a motor vehicle and mechanics student at Kangemi Youth Vocational Training Centre &ldquo;Many women are afraid of getting their hands dirty, but I want to stand out. I cannot wait to own my garage,&rdquo; said Florence Okoth, a student. Ninety are pursuing motor vehicle mechanics, ICT, building and construction, and electrical and electronics courses, while 82 are being trained on catering. Fifty three are in hair dressing and beauty therapy.
