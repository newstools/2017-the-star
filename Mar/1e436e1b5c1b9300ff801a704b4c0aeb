Parliament has received a petition seeking the removal from office of National Land Commission chairman Muhammad Swazuri (pictured) for violation of the Constitution.The petition, signed by Mugo Njeru, was submitted to the National Assembly by Kuresoi North MP Moses Cheboi, a move that kicked off the process of sending Swazuri home.The petitioner cites three grounds for Swazuri&rsquo;s removal.Njeru accuses Swazuri of failing to practice prudent, responsible and clear use of public funds and delivering determinations on behalf of the commission without requisite quorum.He also alleges that Swazuri has failed to uphold a high level of integrity in his conduct during his tenure in office by using his influence to have land compensation money paid to him through a conduit.The petitioner also avers that the NLC chairman has used his position to enrich himself.Njeru says Swazuri defrauded his wife, not named in the petition, out of an unspecified amount of money she had been awarded as compensation by the NLC.Swazuri is on the spot for having later used his powers to fraudulently revoke the wife of the petitioner&rsquo;s legal title in favour of another company, thus violating the right to Article 40 of the Constitution.The petitioner wants Parliament to concur with him that he discloses sufficient grounds as set out in Article 251 of the Constitution to compel the House to ask the President to form a tribunal to investigate the NLC boss.The petition was committed to the Parliamentary Lands Committee chaired by Alex Muiru for consideration.The committee will invite the petitioner, Swazuri and witnesses.The NLC chairman is a holder of an independent constitutional office, which requires that he can only be removed from office through a tribunal.The petition comes at a time when the National Assembly&rsquo;s Finance, Planning and Trade committee suspended its probe into the conduct of Auditor General Edward Ouko following a court order.The court ruled that the committee&rsquo;s probe should be set aside until a case filed in court by Ouko challenging the panel&rsquo;s procedures, is heard on May 10.National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi ruled the House will obey the court order as its lawyers move to the Court of Appeal to challenge the order.
