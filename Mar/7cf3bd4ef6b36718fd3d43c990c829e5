Kenya and Somalia have agreed to resume direct flights between Mogadishu and Nairobi in the next two weeks.This was agreed upon when President Uhuru Kenyatta yesterday hosted his Somalian counterpart Mohamed Sheikh Mohamed for bilateral talks at State House, Nairobi.Mohamed is in the country on a three-day state visit, the first after he was elected Somalia&rsquo;s new President last month.At a joint press conference, Uhuru said their talks revolved around security, trade and investment, civil aviation, agriculture and resource sharing and development.&ldquo;On a bilateral level, we agreed to revitalise our engagement in all areas of mutual interest, including trade and investment, as well as the management of our borders,&rdquo; he said.They agreed to open two entry-exit points on the Kenya-Somalia border to ease movement of people and goods between the two countries.Kenya committed to train Somalian teachers, nurses and administrators to help the country rebuild itself.They also discussed cooperation in livestock development, fisheries, tourism, immigration, labour and health.The two leaders held one-on-one talks before they led their delegations in bilateral talks.&ldquo;The second problem of peace is the recent difficulties with terrorism. Al Shabaab remains ready to kill the innocent in Kenya and Somalia,&rdquo; Uhuru said.&ldquo;President Mohamed and I agree that the fight against these evil criminals must continue until they are no longer a threat.&rdquo;The Somalian leader was accorded full honours, complete with a 21-gun salute.He inspected his first guard of honour mounted by a detachment of the Kenya Army and the military band played the national anthems of Kenya and Somalia.Last month, Uhuru attended the inauguration of Mohamed in Mogadishu and pledged Kenya&rsquo;s continued support to the country.He assured Mohamed that Kenya would remain steadfast in supporting efforts that would bring peace and stability to Somalia.&ldquo;The Somali people have spoken and they have great expectations of the new government in rebuilding and developing the nation,&rdquo; Uhuru said.&ldquo;You, Mr President, also assume office as we face an enormous challenge and we are collaborating to restore regional stability as we face transnational and crossborder crimes. I&rsquo;m confident that God will grant you wisdom to deal with such challenges.&rdquo;
