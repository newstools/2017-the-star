We welcome the positive cooperation between Kenya and Jersey and look forward to an enhanced partnership in future,&rdquo; National Treasury PS Kamau Thugge said when he signed the agreement on behalf of the Kenyan government.&ldquo;The signing of this agreement conveys a powerful message that both Jersey and Kenya are committed to combating issues of historic corruption and financial crime.&rdquo;Senator Ian Gorst, Chief Minister of Jersey, said, &ldquo;The process is one that has understandably taken some time because of the legal complexities of confiscation and asset sharing. The completion of this agreement is a step towards ensuring these funds are returned to the people of Kenya, where they rightfully belong.&rdquo;
