A middle-aged woman is fighting for her life at the Garissa County Referral Hospital after 16 armed militias on Sunday morning stormed their village in Fadiwein in fresh inter-clan clashes.Usuba Noor was shot thrice from behind. Two bullets are lodged in her back.The attackers believed to be from the Bahgere clan from Wajir South attacked Fadiwein village, which is inhabited by Auliyan community.Eleven houses were also burnt and the attackers made away with 300 goats and five camels.They also shot and killed a cow.The two communities are fighting over a disputed boundary with the Bahgere, claiming the area falls under Wajir South, while Auliyan says it is in Garissa county.When the press visited the area, it was deserted and there was no sign of life.Resident Mohammed Yussuf said the attack was the seventh in a span of one year.He said the national government has been favouring the Bahgere community over the Auliyan, claiming no social amenity has been installed in their village.Elder Rashid Garan from Baraki village said the government undertook a disarmament exercise last year, but only the Auliyan clan was affected, leaving them vulnerable.He said the Auliyan clan settled in the area more than 10 years ago, while Bahgere came four years later and started causing mayhem.For now, the village is deserted and all villagers have taken refuge in a nearby Baraki village more than 10km away.In December last year, two men were killed in the same village by armed militias.In August last year, Northeastern regional coordinator Mohamud Saleh chaired a meeting that brought together leaders and elders from the two sides.During the meeting he urged them to remain patient until the process of determining where the boundary is determined.Saleh had said the government would soon show the two communities exactly where the boundary is.Lagdera MP Mohamed Shidiye urged the government to involve the National Land Commission, the IEBC, surveyors and the Physical Planning ministry in its work.
