Bungoma Governor Kenneth Lusaka is distributing more than 32,000 free bags of Minjingu fertiliser to residents.Speaking to the press in Bungoma town yesterday, he said the distribution started in 2013, with 200 farmers per ward, before the number was increased to 400. Lusaka said the public will help identify deserving beneficiaries to ensure no diversion and corruption.Research by the Kenya Agricultural Livestock Research Organisation shows the Nafaka Plus fertiliser, manufactured by Minjingu, led to higher yields than the DAP fertiliser. &ldquo;Application of Nafaka Plus planting and top dressing fertiliser corrects soil Ph and adds nutrients, which significantly improve fertility for maize yields,&rdquo; soil scientist Dr David Mbakaya said.Phosphate in Minjingu fertiliser is of organic origin and is not prone to fixation, unlike DAP, he said. Lusaka said the programme aims to reduce poverty. The rate last year was 55 per cent.&ldquo;We are not confining ourselves to distributing free fertiliser, but also assisting residents by ploughing their farms and carrying out free soil testing to determine the right variety of fertiliser to apply,&rdquo; he said.Felistus Nakhumicha, a widow from Tongaren, said she has received free fertiliser since 2013, increasing production on her one acre from 13 bags in 2012 to 18 in 2013 and 23 last year.
