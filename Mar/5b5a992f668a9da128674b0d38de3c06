Bureaucracy in the counties, not the Jubilee government, is to blame for the slow implementation of projects in Meru, Senator Kiraitu Murungi has said.He was responding to claims by NASA leaders that Jubilee has done little for residents. The opposition made the remarks during its tour of Meru and Tharaka Nithi counties last week. Speaking in Nkubu on Saturday, Kiraitu said President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto are doing all they can to revive stalled projects. &ldquo;There are many development projects initiated by Jubilee. The government promised 20km of road in each constituency. The programme is on course, there have only been a few procurement challenges,&rdquo; he said.Kiraitu added, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that Uhuru has forgotten the people of Meru. I don&rsquo;t know why opposition leader Raila Odinga thinks he can come and say Uhuru has not allocated us money.It is just that there is a process before projects are implemented. And by the way, what has Raila done for Meru?&rdquo;He denied claims that a section of Meru residents support NASA. A large number of people attended the alliance&rsquo;s rallies in Meru. Kiraitu said, &ldquo;Raila is a frequent visitor in Meru and will visit many other times. People will troop to his meetings to listen to him, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean they will vote for him.&rdquo;He continued, &ldquo;I plead with our people to give Uhuru a chance because he means well for us. The very same people who were at the NASA rallies will be the ones coming to dance for Uhuru when he arrives. I&rsquo;m not convinced that Meru residents support NASA. I&rsquo;m not worried about it. This is a Jubilee zone.&rdquo; JP members and MPs Mithika Linturi (Igembe South) and Mpuru Aburi (Tigania East) raised concerns about NASA gaining popularity in the area.
