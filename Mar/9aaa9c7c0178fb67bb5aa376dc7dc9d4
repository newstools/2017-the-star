The Amani National Congress yesterday launched campaigns for its Kakamega governor hopeful Michael Osundwa to unseat Governor Wycliffe Oparanya.Osundwa is the son of former Mumias mayor Patrick Sakwa.The Nairobi-based lawyer on Sunday hosted leaders from Jubilee, Ford Kenya, ANC and ODM at his Etenje home. He promised not to discriminate against anybody on the basis of party affiliation.He said his focus will be to revive the ailing Mumias Sugar Company and create employment for the youth, whom he said have been neglected by the Oparanya administration.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s worrying to see Mumias Sugar Company go under as the county government watches in silence, despite agriculture being devolved. Revival of Mumias requires a leader with an interest inf sugar cane farming,&rdquo; Osundwa said.He said he&rsquo;ll improve road network and ensure residents get county tenders.
