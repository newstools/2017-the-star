Jubilee Holdings yesterday reported a 17.8 per cent growth in net profit to Sh3.68 billion for the full year ended December 2016 compared to Sh3.12 billion in 2015.Profitability was boosted by gross written premium and contributions, which grew by 12.1 per cent in 2016.This was driven by a 43.7 per cent growth in group and individual life business, 15.9 per cent in the medical segment and 4.5 per cent growth in general insurance.&ldquo;We have weathered the tough environment to post the best results in this sector with all business segments and operations posting positive growth. The confidence is due to the firm&rsquo;s stable topline and consistent profit,&rdquo; chairman Nizar Juma said.The group&rsquo;s total asset base was Sh90.6 billion in 2016.Jubilee will continue diversifying its investment portfolio to reduce the risk of volatility from stock market movements, Juma said.The insurer has already made inroads into the energy sector, where it has invested in Tsavo power and Bujagali hydroelectric power station in Uganda.Juma said the two projects have started giving returns.&ldquo;This investment strategy has proven sound during a period of market volatility for the benefits of both JHL&rsquo;s shareholders and pension and life clients and the Group will continue to pursue an investment strategy that is long-term in its outlook,&rdquo; he said in a media briefing in Nairobi.Jubilee Holdings is the only listed insurer that has not issued a profit warning in the last two years despite a bear-run in the Nairobi Securities Exchange.Its share price has stayed above Sh450 even as the NSE 20 Share index fell by 21 per cent for a second consecutive year of decline.Financial services group Britam Holdings recorded impressive performance last year even as its equity assets took another round of losses amid poor performance of the Nairobi Securities Exchange.The group yesterday reported a net profit of Sh2.48 billion for the full year ended December 2016, making a huge turnaround from a loss of Sh1 billion posted in 2015, when the downturn in the performance of the securities market led to a loss of Sh2.8 billion on its financial assets.Audited results showed net realised and unrealised losses on financial assets stood at Sh2.41 billion in 2016 compared to Sh1.86 billion in 2015.The impressive performance was boosted largely by growth in life business. The results show gross earned premiums increased by 19 per cent to Sh8.81 billion compared to Sh7.38 billion in 2015.Non-life business gross earned premiums declined by six per cent from Sh12.2 billion in 2015 to Sh11.5 billion in 2016.
