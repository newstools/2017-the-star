Deputy President William Ruto yesterday ridiculed the opposition for failing to name its presidential candidate as promised.&ldquo;The four who had promised to name their candidate in their rally in Mathare have failed to do so and this was expected,&rdquo; he said.Ruto said opposition members are self-seekers and cannot lead Kenya.He said they are interested in sharing seats.Speaking during a Jubilee rally in Kihoto grounds, Naivasha, Ruto defended government borrowing and said the funds have been used for projects, such as the SGR, road construction and supply of electricity to hundreds of homes.&ldquo;Some of those in the opposition used the borrowed funds to pay Anglo Leasing and Goldenberg and they do not have the moral authority to question our work,&rdquo; he said.National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale criticised Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka over his calls that they would have their own tallying stations.&ldquo;The law is very clear on the issue of tallying and it&rsquo;s only the IEBC that is supposed to have a tallying station and no one else,&rdquo; he said.Duale said a governor opened an illegal bank account to channel funds to finance the NASA campaigns.The MP said he has written to the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission, the National Treasury and the Office of the Auditor General about the matter.Any governor who deposits funds in that account will be charged in court, Duale said.He said Cord leader Raila Odinga defends the governors because they finance his campaigns.Nakuru Governor Kinuthia Mbugua said Jubilee has fulfilled most of its pledges and maintained peace.&ldquo;Jubilee took over power when there was uncertainty across the country, but managed to hold the country together to date,&rdquo; he said.Other leaders who attended the rally are MPs Samuel Arama (Nakuru Town West), David Gikaria (Nakuru Town East), Kimani Ichung&rsquo;wa (Kikuyu), Kimani Ngunjiri (Bahati), Ferdinand Waititu (Kabete), Moses ole Sakuda (Kajiado North), Samuel Gichigi (Kipipiri), Moses Kuria (Gatundu South) and Mary Wambui (Othaya).Narc Kenya leader Martha Karua, nominated Senator Liz Chelule and former Commission for the Implementation of the Constitution chairman Charles Nyachae were also present.
