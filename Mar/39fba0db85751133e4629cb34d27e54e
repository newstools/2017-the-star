Residents of Ndemi, Michore, Kieni and Rukuma villages in Kipipiri have accused flower and vegetable firms of blocking the Malewa river and discharging raw sewage into it.The residents also accuse Mahee Flowers Ltd, Golden Tulips Farm Ltd and Laurel Flowers of polluting the water with chemical effluent. They said this exposes them and their livestock to danger. On Monday, the residents demonstrated along the river, blowing whistles, screaming and dancing. They vandalised Mahee Flowers water pump and destroyed pipes.The demonstrators planned to invade Golden Tulips Farms and Laurel Flowers, but a contingent of police officers, led by Kipipiri OCS William Leting, stopped them.Resident Kibunja wa Teresia said they took the law into their own hands when they realised the government is &ldquo;not willing to resolve our problems, yet we and our livestock are exposed to grave danger&rdquo;.&ldquo;No one cares about us. Our governor is sufficiently informed of our problems, but he continues to sit pretty as we suffer. Our MP Samuel Gichigi and Nyandarua woman representative Wanjiku Muhia are also aware of our suffering. Are we not bona fide residents of Nyandarua? resident Joseph Karuri said.He said they have been visiting hospitals daily with head and stomach problems. &ldquo;We have bought all the medicine from the chemists around.&rdquo;
