The NGO board director, Fazul Mohamed, yesterday said Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka&rsquo;s Foundation has been served with a letter to explain how it has violated financial regulations.Speaking to the Star on the phone, Mohamed said the foundation is still within the 14-day ultimatum to respond to the queries.&ldquo;We are expecting the response from Kalonzo Musyoka so we can act on it. The time we gave him to respond is not over,&rdquo; he said.Last week on Sunday, Kalonzo (pictured), through his publicist Dennis Kavisu, said he will only respond to the NGO Board&rsquo;s claims that his foundation has violated rules once he is served with proof. He threatened to ignore the ultimatum issued by the board, insisting that it&rsquo;s directive were mere allegations. &ldquo;The first mistake the board made was to serve the media before him. It is clear proof of Jubilee&rsquo;s political gimmicks and propaganda. As a lawyer, Kalonzo will have to see the documentation first because he is reading mischief,&rdquo; Kavisu said. There was no comment from Kalonzo&rsquo;s office on whether the former Vice President has responded to the letter. Last week, he had alleged that the move was a Jubilee machination to impede his chances of becoming the NASA flagbearer. Mohamed wrote to the Kalonzo Musyoka Foundation to file documents regarding all secret foreign bank accounts and local and foreign funding agreements the foundation has received since January 2010. He said the foundation unlawfully received millions in foreign currency from unidentified donors.
