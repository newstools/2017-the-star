The Siaya government will launch a free milk project for nursery schools before the end of the month, Governor Cornel Rasanga said yesterday.Some 200 dairy cows have been distributed to farmers in Gem, Ugenya and Ugunja, who will supply the milk.&ldquo;A director has been appointed and he is already working on modalities and structures that will sustain the programme,&rdquo; Rasanga told the Star on the phone. The programme will cost Sh27 million. The milk will be provided on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. There are similar programmers in Embu, Mombasa and Migori counties. The governor urged farmers to either castrate their bulls or sell them and use the money to buy high-yielding dairy cows.
