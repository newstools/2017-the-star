Several new faces have been drafted into the Harambee Stars squad that will go into camp on March 19th for the twin friendly matches against Uganda and Congo DR.Stars&rsquo; coach Stanley Okumbi, back from taking charge of the SportPesa All Stars team freindly against Hull City, has called up 26 local-based players ahead of the team&rsquo;s international friendly matches which will serve as preparation for the upcoming 2019 Afcon qualifiers against Sierra Leone in June 2017.&ldquo;We have called up an initial squad of 26 local-based players who will report for camp at the Kasarani Stadium on March 19,&rdquo; said Okumbi, who also watched national football team captain and Tottenham Hotspur midfield mainstay Victor Wanyama in their English Premier league contest against Everton last Sunday.&ldquo;A further list of foreign-based players called up for the same will be availed in due course as we don&rsquo;t expect them to link up with the rest of the squad until the commencement of the Fifa friendlies window,&rdquo; explained the tactician.Chief among the new call ups is SportPesa Premier League Player of the Year, Kenneth Muguna as well as AFC Leopards new signing Whyvonne Isuza, both seen as instrumental in the national team set up in the future.Robinson Kamura, who was impressive in the All Stars duel against Hull has been given a chance to cement his place in the senior squad, having been a regular in the age groups for the national team. Defender, Joakins Atudo is among the familiar faces in the team alongside first choice custodian Boniface Oluoch and his Gor captain Musa Mohammed, team-mate Francis Kahata and Humphrey Mieno.Patrick Matasi, previously uncapped, has the chance to give Oluoch a run for his money between the post having done himself and his reputation a world of good in the match against Hull.Injury-prone left back Sammy Meja of Thika United returns to the national set up but will face stiff competition from a starting berth from Mathare United&rsquo;s David Mwangi. Sharks&rsquo; highly-rated forward Ovella Ochieng also makes up the over two dozen party that will congregate for residential camp in 10 days. Earlier, Football Kenya Federation (FKF) CEO Robert Muthomi had pointed out that the Kenya vs Uganda friendly that was set for March 22 has been rescheduled to March 23, following consultations and subsequent consensus between the two associations.
