Baringo livestock farmers want the government to pay Sh180,000 debts for the emaciated cattle they delivered last month for sale.Ten farmers on Wednesday expressed their displeasure in Kabarnet town, saying they have unsuccessfully followed up their dues.The aggrieved farmers were from Kapyemit, Kakwane, Kipsoit, Sesyane, Serwok and Sormoi villages in Kabarnet-Soi, Baringo Central subcounty.Led by Joseph Noti, they said each person sold 12 head of cattle for Sh15, 000 each. The programme is intended to dispose of emaciated animals to reduce farmers&rsquo; losses.Noti said they have received only Sh150, 000 for 15 cows.&ldquo;This is the only amount paid to our M-Pesa accounts on the auction day. Since then, we have yet to receive the remaining amount totalling Sh180,000,&rdquo; he said.Besides the pay delay, the farmers criticise the programme. They say they were promised a standard rate of Sh18,000 per cow, but this was reduced to between Sh10,000 and Sh15,000.
