A meeting convened to appoint the Nairobi county elections board by the Jubilee secretariat ended in chaos after two groups of aspirants and their supporter clashed.The groups, Team Nairobi and Team Peter Kenneth supporters, clashed after a section of Team Nairobi aspirants alleged that the secretariat had a list of preferred members that would represent the election board.The Jubilee Party election board had outlined that the aspirants who had paid for the nomination were the only ones mandated to undertake the exercise.According to the board aspirants were required to come up with 17 names each to represent the 17 constituencies in Nairobi and the election board was to act as an observer.Jubilee Party election board member Michael Waweru said the two groups &mdash; Team Nairobi and Team Peter Kenneth &mdash; had been instructed to give two names before settling on one that was to be agreed upon by the aspirants.&ldquo;We had 34 names and these were given by both aspirants supporting Team Nairobi and those supporting Peter Kenneth, but today the aspirants were to agree on one name, thus giving us 17 names to represent the county election board,&rdquo; Waweru said.Waweru said the officials of the county election board were not to supervise the Nairobi nominations.&ldquo;The officials of the board we are choosing are not even going to oversee the nominations in Nairobi, they will be taken to areas like Mandera and Eastern and others from other regions brought to Nairobi to increase transparency,&rdquo; Waweru said.Starehe MP Maina Kamanda said the party has clear outlines and they followed the right procedure in coming up with the names.&ldquo;The party constitution is clear that the board is the one mandated to oversee the appointment of the county election board but we had included the aspirants in the process to assure transparency,&rdquo; Kamanda said.
