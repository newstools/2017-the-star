The Foreign Affairs ministry has refuted claims the government has abandoned four Kenyans jailed in Juba, South Sudan, over fraud.Boniface Chuma, Ravi Ghaghda, Antony Keya and Anthony Mwadime were working in the country when they were arrested on May 29, 2015.They were charged with various offences related to financial misappropriation and given 72-year jail sentences.Foreign Affairs CS Amina Mohamed told Parliament that she would follow up the matter but the families of the four said no action had been taken.Via Twitter on Tuesday, the ministry said: "It is not true that the [South Sudan four] have been ignored."It added that it has been following the proceedings keenly but "cannot prosecute the case in public at the risk of jeopardising negotiations and an appeal pending at the Juba High Court."The families were promised a full briefing but it was noted that the case is "extremely sensitive" due to the "colossal amounts involved" and aspects touching on the office of the South Sudan president.Read: Kenyans sentenced to life in South Sudan were not helped by State, kins claimThe ministry said Kenyan ambassador to South Sudan Cleland Leshore visited the four earlier in the day."Ambassador Leshore has personally visited them and the families have been kept informed," read the tweet.Leshore said he visited often and that negotiations for the release of the Kenyans were ongoing.The families asked President Kenyatta for help in a letter on Monday, saying their direct approach came after Amina's ministry denied them audience.The Kenyans and their boss were among 16 convicted in South Sudan for stealing Sh1.4 million from President Salva Kiir's office.Former executive director Yel Luol and national security officer John Agou were also incarcerated.
