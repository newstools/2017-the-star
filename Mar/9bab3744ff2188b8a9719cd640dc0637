Party leaders should allow voters to use their national ID cards during Jubilee primaries, three MPs have urged. The nominations are slated for next month.Ruiru MP Esther Gathogo, Kiambu woman representative Anna Nyokabi and her Murang&rsquo;a counterpart Sabina Chege said the Jubilee Party smartcards will lock out many voters from participating in the exercise, especially those in remote areas.The three spoke on Friday at Kahawa Wendani, Ruiru constituency, during the official opening of the first public primary school in the area funded through the National Government Constituency Development Fund.Gathogo said it will be unfair to stop the voters from nominating their preferred candidates for lack of smartcards. &ldquo;The nominations are around the corner and not every eligible voter is in possession of the smartcards. The party officials should ease the matter by allowing voters to use their IDs during the primaries to ensure that all citizens are accorded their democratic right and space to vote,&rdquo; Gathogo said.Chege said use of IDs will be a win-win for voters and aspirants. &ldquo;We also insist that the party nominations officials should ensure the primaries will be free and fair so as not to taint JP&rsquo;s name,&rdquo; Chege said.The woman representative said she is optimistic that Jubilee will retain power because it has a large support base than the opposition.&ldquo;What the Jubilee government has done to develop the country for the last three years has won them hearts of many Kenyans, even in the NASA&rsquo;s strongholds. We are sure Kenyans will give UhuRuto another term,&rdquo; she said.Nyokabi said the smartcards will disadvantage residents in rural areas, most who are not technology aware. Meanwhile, Chege who is also the chairperson of the Education committee in the National Assembly said Sh13.7 million has been included in the budget for the implementation of the CBA signed by the two teachers&rsquo; unions, Kenya Natonal Union of Teachers and KUPPET, and the Teachers Service Commission in October last year.&ldquo;This means that there will be no more picketing by the teachers,&rdquo; she said.She said Gatong&rsquo;ora area in Ruiru constituency will be marked as a hardship area for teachers this year.Kahawa Wendani Primary school, is an initiative of Gathogo.
