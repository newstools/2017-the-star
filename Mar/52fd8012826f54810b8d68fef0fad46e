Two employees of Ecobank Ltd and a businesswoman were yesterday charged in a Nairobi court with conspiring to steal Sh55.6 million from the institution. Kevin Kathurima, the operations manager, Norman Karungo a relationship officer, and businesswoman Eucabeth Booko appeared before chief magistrate Francis Andayi and denied the charges. The prosecution said the $54,000 (Sh55.6 million) theft occurred on Monday at the Ecobank Towers branch. The court heard that on the day, the stolen money was traced to Booko&rsquo;s account as well as that of Peter Mutonyi, who is still at large. Kathurima, who was in charge of the vault, had reported the cash was missing. Police said Karungo was the holder of the keys and had access to the strongroom and vault. He was also transaction inputter. Booko, who is a client, was arrested at Ecobank Towers as she allegedly withdraw the cash. When Booko appeared in court on Monday, she claimed she was arrested over an incident she was unaware of. &ldquo;I was arrested and dragged to court over something l don&rsquo;t know about. l received an alert on phone that l have deposited cash in my account. l haven&rsquo;t withdrawn anything,&rdquo; she said. The three were released on Sh2 million bail each.
