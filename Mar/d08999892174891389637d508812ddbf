Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga has faulted the EACC for including his name in a list of county chiefs being investigated for alleged graft.He accused the agency of being on a witch-hunting spree to taint incumbents&rsquo; image as they seek reelection.&ldquo;The law states that everyone is innocent until proved guilty. That is why President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto were elected despite having cases at The Hague,&rdquo; Rasanga said yesterday He said he cannot be barred from running because he has not been convicted. But Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo said some governors have stolen a lot of public cash.&ldquo;The fact they have not been prosecuted for compromising the courts does not mean they are not criminals,&rdquo; he said.
