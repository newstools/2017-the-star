MCA Mohamed Muhumed urged the MPs to be objective during campaigns.Deputy Speaker Adan Guracho said Abdullahi deserves to be reelected because &ldquo;he has transformed the county.&rdquo;Mps are &lsquo;petty&rsquo;He said the anti-Abdullahi MPs are petty and do not know the realities on the ground about how the governor&rsquo;s administration has changed residents&rsquo; lives.Guracho accused the MPs of hiring Nairobi residents to pose as MCAs from Wajir during the press conference to announce the withdrawal of support.&ldquo;It is dishonest and unethical of our MPs to present some people they have picked from the streets as MCAs and tell them to speak badly of the governor,&rdquo; Muhumed said.The MPs held a press conference in Nairobi on Saturday and announced they had withdrawn their support for Abdullahi.They accused him of failing to consult them on county affairs.Elmi accused the governor of failing to put in measures to deal with drought.&lsquo;A governor under siege&rsquo;Abdullahi accused the MPs of disrespecting him, despite doing a good job.The MCAs and MPs have been holding parallel rallies.
