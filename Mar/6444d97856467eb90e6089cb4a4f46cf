Police in Nairobi are helping to investigate a case in which a former banker and three other people are charged with defrauding the TSS family of Sh10 billion.Assistant DPP Alexander Muteti yesterday said he needs more time since officers from Nairobi have joined the probe.Muteti told senior principal magistrate Francis Kyambia to set another date for consolidation of the matter.So far, four people have been charged with the fall of the TSS business empire. They are Aweys Mohammed, Zein Mohammed, Zahir Khaku and ex-banker James Muturi.The four denied the charges and were released on Sh3 million bond each.The case came up for consolidation yesterday since those charged were arrested separately.Muteti also wants the lawyer representing the four suspects disqualified after he was accused of representing the complainant in another matter pertaining to his business.Gikandi Ngibuini has asked the court to dismiss the application, adding it is his right to represent anyone.Twahir Sheikh Said was buried on January 11, leaving his business empire in debt running into billions of shillings.Meanwhile, his children are in court fighting for the ownership of his property. Sabir has accused his brother Noorein, of Transmara Logistics, of fraud. Sabir, through his lawyer Muriu Mungai, alleged the transfer and registration of vehicles and trailers by Noorein&rsquo;s company was done fraudulently.Mungai said Sabir is the bona fide owner of the vehicles, registered under TSS&rsquo;s Pop In Service company in Nairobi.The case will be mentioned on March 23.
