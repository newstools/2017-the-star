Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko yesterday submitted his nomination papers at the Jubilee Party headquarters and affirmed his candidature as Nairobi governor hopeful. He was accompanied by ‘Team Nairobi’ leaders Bishop Margaret Wanjiru, Dagoretti South MP Dennis Waweru and Nominated MP Johnson Sakaja. Sonko said he had been forced to submit his papers on the last day given by the party after ‘forces’ tried to prevent him from beating the deadline. Sakaja had on Thursday stepped down from the governor race and opted for the Senate seat in what he said was a way of uniting the team. “I was forced to come today after the many hurdles put before me, but I’m thankful to God that I got the papers. For instance I applied for a certificate good conduct two weeks ago together with Bishop Wanjiru and she got hers an hour later. But I got mine yesterday, I don’t know who had tried to bar me from being cleared,” Sonko said. “As you can all see, we as Team Nairobi have the numbers and we will prove to the people trying to use tribal politics to block us from vying to send them where they belong.” On Thursday, the senator posted photos of the documents on social media, as well as those of his certificate of good conduct from the DCI. Receiving the papers on Friday, Head of the Jubilee Party Secretariat Raphael Tuju congratulated the members. “I congratulate the people who have brought the papers today. The nomination will be a fair process,” he said. Tuju said the Jubilee Party’s focus is to get Nairobi to become a Jubilee county. “The party will do anything in its position to ensure that we have a Jubilee aspirant for Nairobi county to ensure we clinch this position,” he said.
