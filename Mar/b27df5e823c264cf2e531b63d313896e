Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua would be reelected if election were held today, new survey indicates. The survey released yesterday by the Trends and Insights for Africa shows that Governor Mutua is still the preferred candidate with 75 per cent approval. He is followed by Wavinya Ndeti with 8 per cent. In a survey conducted between February 15 and 19, 600 respondents were interviewed in Machakos county. The survey indicates that 54 per cent of the respondents felt closer to NASA, compared to Maendeleo Chap Chap's 27 per cent and Jubilee's 10 per cent. Out of 54 per cent NASA supporters 38 per cent were more closer to Wiper, ODM five per cent and ANC three per cent. The margin of error is +/-4 per cent. TIFA managing director Maggie Ireri said only eight per cent of the respondents were undecided on which candidate to vote for as governor. In a poll conducted in August last year, Mutua had 81 per cent support for the governor's race followed by Wavinya Ndeti with five per cent and Johnson Muthama three per cent. Ireri said Mutua's drop could be attributed to his fallout with Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka. It is rather obvious that the scuffle between the two led to the popularity drops of Mutua, Ireri said. The survey further shows that Muthama is still the preferred candidate for the Senate seat with 54 per cent. He is followed by Wavinya Ndeti with 13 per cent. Ireri said Muthama's popularity has improved from 34 per cent in the previous poll to 54 per cent. The number of undecided voters had, however, risen from 35 per cent last year to 39 per cent. The support for Susan Mbinya as the woman representative had increased from 36 per cent last year to 42 per cent. The number of undecided voters for the woman representative had reduced from 44 per cent to 39 per cent.
