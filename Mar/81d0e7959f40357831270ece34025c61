Barely two days after Governor Kenneth Lusaka warned his officers of consequences if they engaged in corruption, the anti-corruption agency has pitched camp in Bungoma.The Star has established that the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission has written to the county secretary and the county government to provide details of companies suspected to have won tenders irregularly.EACC director of investigations Abdi Mohamud said the companies in question are M&rsquo;big, Multi Business Shooters Investment, Barowest Investment, Ambition Enterprise, Galco Agencies and Two Calves.&ldquo;To assist the commission with the investigations, you are required to provide certified copies of the approved procurement plan for 2014-15, purchase requisition for the subject tenders, approved prequalification list of contractors and suppliers, and set evaluation criteria,&rdquo; Mohamud said. The anti-graft agency says other documents required for the investigations include all bid documents submitted by the bidders, approval for the use of restricted tendering method and appointment letters of the tender opening and evaluation committees and their contact details.Lusaka has in the past been tough on his staff, saying they will face the sack and eventually the full force of the law if they steal public resources.&ldquo;I am tired of my name being stained by a few selfish officers who do not want to drive the development agenda, but steal public money,&rdquo; he said at a political rally in Bukembe Market earlier this week.The county boss said he will work in close collaboration with the anti-corruption agency to make Bungoma a &ldquo;corruption-free&rdquo; zone. Currently, some county officers have been taken to court over the infamous wheelbarrow scandal.
