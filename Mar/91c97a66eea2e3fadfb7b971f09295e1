Sir Alex Ferguson admits he still gets nervous watching Manchester United play against their old rivals Liverpool and Manchester City.The 75-year-old Scot has been a regular spectator at United games since retiring in 2013 when he accepted a role as director and club ambassador at Old Trafford.Ferguson was known for his explosive temperament during a period of unprecedented success at United, but insists that he keeps calm in the stands these days &ndash; unless United are up against Liverpool or City.&ldquo;Being at the club for 26-and-a-half years I didn&rsquo;t want to wipe it out of my life,&rdquo; said Ferguson. &ldquo;When they made me a director and an ambassador, I thought that was the perfect position to be in &ndash; watching the team, enjoying it and travelling with them at times.&rdquo;&ldquo;Strangely enough, I don&rsquo;t get over-excited about it. I enjoy watching because they&rsquo;re a great club to watch. There&rsquo;s always something exciting about that club, there&rsquo;s always something going to happen. No matter whether they lose or win, there&rsquo;s always something really exciting about it.&rdquo;&ldquo;The only time I get a bit anxious is when we play Liverpool and Man City because those are the biggest games. The things about English football is the tribalism. You&rsquo;ve got the London clubs, the Midlands clubs and the Yorkshire clubs. That creates a real competitive edge to matches.&rdquo;&ldquo;But nothing compares to the Liverpool game. Of course, Manchester City now have risen to a very prominent position in the game and those games have become very important too.&rdquo;Ferguson praised current boss Jose Mourinho for winning the League Cup in his first season and claimed that adding the Europa League probably represents United&rsquo;s best chance of returning to the Champions League next season.He added: &ldquo;I get on well with Jose and I think he&rsquo;s doing a really good job. He&rsquo;s been a bit unlucky because they&rsquo;ve been absolutely brilliant in most of their home games and drawn (seven of) them. If they had got the wins they deserved they would be challenging for the league, no doubt about that.&rdquo;&ldquo;Their season is still alive. They&rsquo;ve won the League Cup, they&rsquo;re in the Europa League and I think they have a great chance there. It&rsquo;s very important now because if you win it you are in the Champions League.&rdquo;&ldquo;In the Premier League at the moment, there is a real fight for the positions behind Chelsea &ndash; Tottenham, Arsenal, Liverpool, ourselves. It&rsquo;s not going to be easy to get into the top four.&ldquo;They could do it. But I look at the Europa League as a great chance. First of all, they&rsquo;ve never won the Europa League. We&rsquo;ve not been in it many times but none the less it adds to the CV.&rdquo;&ldquo;Winning a trophy at United is the most important thing. That&rsquo;s what the club&rsquo;s history is about, winning trophies. I looked upon the League Cup as the manager did, and his build up to it was &ldquo;this is an important trophy&rdquo;. I was fortunate enough to win it four times. No matter the trophy, if you get to a final you&rsquo;ve got to win it.&rdquo;
