Kisii county is paying for ghost projects, three county assembly committees have said.Last week the committees tabled the 2014-15 County Budget Review Outlook Paper. It showed some projects have stalled, despite allocations of millions of shillings.&ldquo;For instance, some projects are indicated as fully complete but in the real sense they [are halfway] done. This suggests that funds would have been allocated and fully paid without completion,&rdquo; chairman Charles Nyagoto said.He said some projects exist on paper only, but not on the ground. Nyagoto cited Kiango and Kemoreko Early Child Development Education centres, which were paid for but are incomplete.The county assembly warned that contractors who do substandard work will be blacklisted and be ineligible to bid for tenders for five years. The three committees that came up with the report are Accounts, Public Investments, and Implementation.The paper indicates that Gesabkwa ECDE centre is 70 per cent complete but it is listed alongside Masimba, Marani and Sameta libraries, which are nonexistent.The 25-member joint committee established that procurement regulations and laws were violated because tenders were given out secretly, instead of through a competitive process.Nyagoto said there are flaws in revenue collection and accounting.&ldquo;We noted that not all the money was deposited to the common fund from the exchequer and local collections,&rdquo; reads the report. &ldquo;Local collections are sometimes spent at source, which is against the Public Finance Management Act and the Constitution. This affects the budgeting process and implementation.&rdquo;
