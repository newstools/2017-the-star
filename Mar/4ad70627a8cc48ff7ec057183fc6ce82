Today&rsquo;s Budget reading by Treasury CS Henry Rotich marks that time of year traders dread most. It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether you are a small-time or big-time trader. Everyone dreads Budget Day in Kenya.For a long time, there has been a misconception that the only people who fear Budget Day are corporates that sell alcohol, cigarettes and associated products, and their clients. This is because of the ever-changing, punitive tax regime in that sector.But as a kerosene seller who mainly plies his trade in Kayole and the Mukuru and Sinai slums in Nairobi, I can assure that Budget Day is not only a day of anxiety for alcohol manufacturers. It is a nightmare for us too because whatever Rotich says today will determine whether I get or lose more customers.The fluctuating tax environment makes it difficult to plan for my business. I also find it hard to decide on personal expenditures such as going on holiday or buying expensive machines such as motorcycles for deliveries.The fact that I operate my business in a price-sensitive segment of society means that any slight alteration in the tax regime, even by just a few shillings, is enough to send away or bring me new customers. This might seem like paraffin traders crying wolf, until you look at the statistics.Between 2010 and June last year, when kerosene was not taxed, the number of households that directly bought kerosene from my outlets in Soweto, Kayole, was high. In May last year, shortly before the tax hikes on the commodity in June, I was selling about 1,000 litres daily.But when Rotich reintroduced excise duty on kerosene, which was scrapped by President Uhuru Kenyatta when he was Finance minister in 2010, consumption in Soweto, amongst my customers, reduced to about 600 litres per day.Rotich said the absence of tax on kerosene had led to adulteration, a practice where some rogue oil marketing companies mix kerosene with other commodities such as petrol to make unfair profits.The contention was that adulteration denied oil marketers business in the neighbouring countries and gave them a bad reputation.But it is more absurd that in order to discourage this harmful practice, Rotich reintroduced excise duty on kerosene at Sh7, 205 per 1,000 litres. This means that for every litre of kerosene consumers buy, they give the government Sh7.21.Many Kenyans rely on paraffin as a cheaper alternative to LPG and other expensive means of cooking. The question on their minds was why the state had reintroduced tax on kerosene, a commodity viewed as a social good due to its popularity with low income earners?Out of the Sh54 that a litre was sold for before June, 75 per cent (Sh41 ) went to international and freight costs, one per cent ( 50 cents) went to taxes and levies, 17 per cent (Sh9 ) to wholesale and retail margins and five per cent (Sh4 ) to distribution.The current Energy Regulatory Commission&rsquo;s fuel price capping formula puts the price of a litre of paraffin in Nairobi at Sh67.96 and Sh81.77 in Mandera.The uncertainty and unplanned tax hikes mean a reduction in the number of customers, many of whom opt to use cheaper means like firewood. They are also bad for business.It means we cannot plan for the next month or year. As I write this, most paraffin traders have started hoarding stock because of the expected tax increase in today&rsquo;s Budget.The government must come up with a more predictable, fair and just tax regime that not only facilitates fair trade, but also makes life more affordable for the millions of Kenyans struggling to make a living.The writer sells kerosene in bulk in a number of slums in Nairobimeshackodhiambo18@yahoo.com
