Women running for political seats in Turkana county yesterday said they are being harassed, intimidated and threatened by their male counterparts. Some of the women aspirants say they have received threats from male aspirants. However, the more than 35 hopefuls, led by Turkana East MCA aspirant Zainab Lokaale, said they are determined to participate in the polls to the end, despite the threats. “Our society here is not yet as open as in other parts of the country. Here, some men still think leadership is a preserve for them. Things have changed and the Constitution guarantees all of us equal rights,” she said. Lokaale read the statement on behalf of her colleagues after a meeting at Eliye Springs. “Some of us have even been threatened with rape and branded prostitutes just because we are in politics. That is retrogressive and has not space in modern times,” she said. Woman representative Joyce Emanikor said she supports more women to run for all elective seats. “Those aspirants or activists threatening women should stop doing so. We encourage those affected to report those threats to police so that action can be taken,” she said. The women aspirants said winning elections should be at the ballot, not through threats and intimidation. Turkwel MCA aspirant Patricia Kebo said they have no problem with political parties, but their male colleagues. “We will face each other at the ballot and we believe we have the necessary capacity to serve our people as leaders,” she said. Meanwhile, nominated Senator Catherine Mukite has said more women should be given jobs in the counties, where men still dominate. She urged the Trans Nzoia government to employ women in different administrative posts. “The county government should consider employing more women to comply with the two-thirds gender rule, as required by the Constitution," Mukite said. She also wants those aspiring for the position of governor to appoint women running mates.
