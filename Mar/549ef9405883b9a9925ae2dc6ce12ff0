Guus Hiddink says he has had no contact with the Leicester City owners over the current managerial vacancy at the King Power Stadium, but he refused to rule out the possibility of taking over the Foxes.Roy Hodgson held secret talks with owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, who is a long-term admirer of the former England manager.Former Chelsea boss Hiddink is among the candidates being touted for another short-term firefighting mission at the Midlands club, but the 70-year-old remains coy on his future.&ldquo;I have no had contact with Leicester,&rdquo; said the Dutchman. &ldquo;I think Leicester have done very well by going with the assistant manager after Ranieri&rsquo;s dismissal. They proved themselves against Liverpool.&rdquo;&ldquo;I have so much love for football that I do not exclude it. I never go to a club for several years, but I think it&rsquo;s great to be working with young people.&rdquo; Hiddink has enjoyed two interim spells as manager at Chelsea during his illustrious managerial career, winning the FA Cup in 2009 and steadying the ship last season following the dismissal of Jose Mourinho. The Dutchman was approached in 2015 before Claudio Ranieri got the gig, but his knowledge could prove valuable both at the foot of the Premier League and should progress be made in the Champions League. Former manager Nigel Pearson has also been linked with the vacancy, but Leicester made the perfect start to life after Claudio Ranieri by recording a 3-1 win over Liverpool on Monday under caretaker manager Craig Shakespeare.The interim boss is set to be in charge once more for the visit of Hull in the Premier League on Saturday and he remains in pole position as Leicester continue their search for Ranieri&rsquo;s successor.Another victory over the Tigers would steer Leicester further away from relegation danger, and could lead to Shakespeare being handed the reins until the end of the season.
