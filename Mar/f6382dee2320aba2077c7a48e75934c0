The entry of Tunisia to the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa will be a boost to Intra-African trade. The north African country is preparing to sign a treaty to join the 19-member regional trading bloc during its next Summit in October, the secretariat said in a statement. The signature will herald the admission of Tunisia to Comesa as its 20th member state. This comes after the Bureau of the Council of Ministers was mandated to enter into negotiations with the Republic of Tunisia on the terms and conditions of accession to the Comesa Treaty. Tunisian Prime Minister and head of government Yousef Achahed has said his country is ready.
