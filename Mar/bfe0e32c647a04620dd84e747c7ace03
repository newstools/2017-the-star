The Jubilee Party has reaped massively in the Coast, following the defection of prominent politicians from the opposition, including half the governors.Coast has six counties.President Uhuru Kenyatta's JP has raided all Coast counties, in what is seen as the party making inroads in the once perceived Cord stronghold.The latest entrant is Tana River Governor Hussein Dado, who defected from Wiper yesterday. Taita Taveta Senator Dan Mwazo and woman representative Joyce Lay defected from ODM.This now brings to half, the number of governors to have defected from the opposition to join JP.Kwale's Salim Mvurya ditched ODM last year.Lamu's Issa Timamy, who was elected on the UDF party, but defected to Jubilee then later rejoined Musalia Mudavadi's ANC party. But he has been warming up to JP.Timamy has however been quoted saying he is still in ANC, but he will support the government in project implementation. This has been seen by many as a silent endorsement of JP.Only governors Hassan Joho (Mombasa), Amason Kingi (Kilifi) and John Mruttu (Taita Taveta) are still in ODM, a party under the NASA coalition.Yesterday, several buses carrying members from the Somali community in Tana River were seen at State House, Mombasa, moments after reports went round that their governor had defected.Recently, ODM party leader Raila Odinga said defectors have ruined their political careers.The defections began with Kilifi North Gideon Mung'aro, who left ODM after being stripped off the party whip position.Later, the Coast leadership stripped him of the Coast Parliamentary Group chairman title, a war he fought but lost to Kaloleni MP Gunga Mwinga.Speaking to the Star on Friday, Mung'aro said, "We, in Coast, can no longer afford to be in the opposition. We shall be part of the government and that is why I have no regrets leaving ODM. No development or positive agenda is discussed in that party." In Kilifi, Deputy Governor Kenneth Kamto from ODM defected to Jubilee last year.Mombasa Deputy Governor Hazel Katana, who has been at loggerheads with her boss, Joho, ditched the party on January 28, after years of what she said were frustrations within the party at the county level.Katana was received by the President himself."President Uhuru personally receiving Katana is a show that Jubilee can do it and is raiding the opposition backyard," Pwani University don Richard Chimera said.Among the politicians who joined Mung'aro when he defected were Likoni's Masoud Mwahima, Kwale woman representative Zainab Chidzuga, Kilifi South MP Mustafa Iddi, Lunga Lunga's Khatib Mwashetani, and MCAs across the region.Mvurya's deputy Fatuma Amani also followed her boss to Jubilee, and the NASA coalition has been forced back to the drawing board to get a replacement, with former ambassador Chirau Mwakwere's name being fronted.During Mwahima's defection last year, he said, "I will continue working with the government and ensure my people get jobs. Let them talk ill but when they see me enjoying the fruits, they will realise I made the right choice."Most leaders defended their actions, saying Jubilee has initiated many development projects at the Coast, which has been lagging behind and also faces numerous historical injustices including the thorny land issues.In 2015, Suleiman Shahbal who ran for Mombasa governor and lost to Joho, also left Cord for Jubilee.He is now President Uhuru's hope of trouncing the incumbent, after being declared the Jubilee aspirant.His running mate, Ananiah Mwaboza, was in URP that merged with 12 other parties to form JP. He hopes to make a political victory after years of struggle and politician limbo.In a recent interview, Shahbal said the fact that Wiper was still under Cord, and now in NASA, meant that it will never grow politically and there may be no future Some of the politicians felt party nominations in ODM or Cord, and now NASA, will not be free and fair.Mvurya said he felt there was a lot of uncertainty around the party's nominations.A few months ago, the opposition disciplinary committee suspended and expelled several of its former party members for what they said was a violation of the law and the party's constitution. They had been accused of working for and joining rival parties.
