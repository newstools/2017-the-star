Student leaders from public and private universities have threatened to call a demonstration if the lecturers&rsquo; strike persists beyond this week. The strike, which enters its 45th day today, has paralysed learning, forcing some administrators to close institutions indefinitely. Yesterday, Moi University Nairobi campus chairman Edwin Kegoli said their right to education has been violated, because of inconsistencies in the academic calendar.&ldquo;From Tuesday next week, we will camp on Harambee Avenue so that whenever the President comes in the morning and leaves in the evening, he will see how frustrated students are,&rdquo; he said.Kegoli and his colleagues presented a petition in Parliament, urging MPs to intervene.&ldquo;It is our humble prayer the National Assembly will understand the continuation of the lecturers&rsquo; strike limits students from advancing,&rdquo; Kegoli said.He said students pursuing courses with a lot of practical modules are the worst hit because they rely heavily on the guidance of lecturers.Kegoli said privately sponsored students, especially those who have taken study leave, have strict timelines to complete their degrees.Moi University student Paul Abok said, &ldquo;We are concerned government officials have not tried hard enough to negotiate with the lecturers. Students on private programmes are losing the most because they are costly.&rdquo; Jaramogi Oginga Odinga University of Science and Technology student Victor Njeru said, &ldquo;We cannot live in a country where doctors strike, lecturers strike and the country goes on like nothing has happened.&rdquo;The student leaders also raised concerns that students are now engaging in risky activities, including unprotected sex, due to idleness.Meanwhile, lecturers are today set to hold protests in Nairobi to push for the implementation of the 2013-17 CBA.The dons had suspended the demos last week to give room for negotiations, but UASU secretary general Constantine Wasonga accused the government of being &ldquo;noncommittal&rdquo; on negotiations. The tutors rejected a Sh10 billion offer they were given by the government in January, saying it was too little.
