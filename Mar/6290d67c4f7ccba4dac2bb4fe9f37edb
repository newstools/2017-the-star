The National Cohesion and Integration Commission has said not all abusive utterances by politicians qualify as hate speech as some are directed towards individuals rather than a community.NCIC chairperson Francis ole Kaparo yesterday said, &ldquo;When someone calls Kaparo a fool it might be true, but when someone says Kaparo and all Masaai&rsquo;s are fools then that&rsquo;s hate speech and we won&rsquo;t allow it.&rdquo;He spoke during the induction training for the cohesion monitors at Multimedia University, Nairobi.Uhuru outburstKaparo&rsquo;s utterance comes a few days after opposition members, led by nominated legislator Oburu Oginga, complained about President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s utterance towards Turkana Governor Josphat Nanok.Last week, Uhuru angrily abused an unnamed leader in Turkana county, suspected to be Nanok. The video of the perceived altercation went viral.Kaparo has asked politicians to stop using abusive terms as they command huge influence.&ldquo;We are worried this word exchanges might be personal but might spur hate amongst communities as these people are our leaders and have a huge following,&rdquo; he said.No room for hate speechKaparo added that the commission will not tolerate hate speech.The chairman commissioned 47 recording cameras, 47 body cameras that have the power to capture voice 200 metres away and more than 300 voice recorders to be used to monitors inciters.The cameras will be distributed in every county.&ldquo;There is no room for hate mongers; we have seen enough of this. In 1992, they called it land clashes, in 2007 they referred to it as a disputed election, in subsequent years it has evolved to hate speech and we won&rsquo;t tolerate it,&rdquo; he said.Stop incitement to protect economyDeputy director of the Directorate of Criminal Investigation, Joseph Ashimala, IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati and the UNDP resident representative Siddharth Chatterjee warned against hate speech.&ldquo;We always experience a fall in the GDP each election year, but we have to ensure this year will be different,&rdquo; Siddharth said.
