Baringo residents want senator Gideon Moi to explain where the surveillance chopper he promised them in 2013 is.They said on Wednesday that he promised the aircraft during campaigns to help monitor armed bandits who have killed people and animals in recent attacks.&ldquo;You pledged to purchase [it] immediately immediately after winning the seat. Where is it now that we are suffering in the hands of heartless bandits?&rdquo; one asked.The residents confronted the Senator when he landed to console the family of slain Ng'orora location chief Thomas Ruttok.Ruttok was shot by Pokot bandits on February 24 in Bartabwa area.Read: Family of chief killed during DP Ruto Baringo visit living IDP camps, unable to plan burialResident Samuel Kandagor told Gideon that very little has been done to end banditry since it started in 1977.Martha Elijah said she was among 450 displaced Bartabwa residents and that her son sustained a leg injury after being shot on Monday.Many people have either been killed or injured while more than 30,000 have been displaced in Baringo over the last two weeks.In his defence, Gideon accused Jubilee government of frustrating his plans for the chopper."I had already given my own Sh3.8 million towards a visibility study prior to buying the chopper," he said. "I was cut short by a letter from the Interior ministry saying I should refrain from doing so because it is the work of government to provide security."The Senator said he lost his money in the process.Regarding the insecurity, Gideon promised to pay school fees for the killed chief's children and denied claimed that he was opposed to police operations."At no time have I opened my mouth to support the withdrawal of the operation against Pokot bandits," he said, but accused DP William Ruto of using the wave of insecurity to taint his name.BarwessaMCA Joseph Makilap said those who died in the hands of bandits should be heavily compensated, just like KDF soldiers killed in Somalia."If fallen soldiers are paid Sh10 million, our people who have been killed by bandits should be treated the same way," he said.The residents also requested immediate installation of a mobile network booster in the area.Read: Ruto issues shoot-to-kill order after daring bandits disrupt his Baringo visit
