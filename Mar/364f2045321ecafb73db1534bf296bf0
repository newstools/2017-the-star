The Confederation of African Football's
secretary general Hicham El Amrani resigned on Sunday, just over
a week after elections swept long-standing president Issa
Hayatou from power. El Amrani, in a letter to African football associations,
said he would be departing on Monday, but gave no reason for his
decision. The 37-year-old Moroccan had served as secretary general for
the last six years. Issa Hayatou was deposed as CAF president 10 days ago at
elections in Ethiopia, where six of his allies on the body's
executive committee also lost their positions. The 70-year-old
Hayatou had served as president for 29 years. New CAF president Ahmad of Madagascar is due to meet staff
members in Cairo on Monday.
