Bomet MCAs did not attend the Devolution Conference, which started on Tuesday.Governor Isaac Rutto was present and led a team of executives to the function during the summit opening on Monday. President Uhuru Kenyatta opened the conference. The MCAs skipped the event and instead attended a meeting in Nairobi. A message circulated by Bomet clerk Isaac Kitur on Monday evening asked members to attend a meeting to assess the Standing Orders at the Multimedia University in Nairobi. Leaders have criticised the MCAs for skipping the conference. Former Bomet mayor Kipkemoi Barsumei said it was pointless for the MCAs to attend a meeting to discuss house matters a few months before dissolution of the house. He said, &ldquo;It is only a matter of time before members break to start campaigns. It&rsquo;s strange they are busy discussing irrelevant issues.&rdquo;
