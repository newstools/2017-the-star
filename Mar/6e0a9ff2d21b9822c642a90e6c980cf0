The Education ministry and Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development are developing a new school curriculum whose main focus is learners&rsquo; competence.Education CS Fred Matiang&rsquo;i said this is part of the ongoing reforms that seek to promote integrity among students.&ldquo;We are proposing changes to our education curriculum to gradually invest in the change that focuses on continuous evaluation,&rdquo; Matiang&rsquo;i said. &ldquo;To some extent, this will require reforming our current teacher training framework, retraining some of the critical actors in the evaluation chain, and a relook at the whole process of the spectrum of assessment.&rdquo;The pilot phase of the proposed new system, which puts emphasis on students&rsquo; interests, abilities and talents, will kick off later this year. The system will be segmented into technical, talent development, general, and vocational education. &ldquo;These different pathways will enable students to have an opportunity to pursue different career pathways of their interest and, in turn, build a relevant 21st century workforce,&rdquo; Matiang&rsquo;i said. He addressed a symposium attended by school principals from Anglican Church-sponsored secondary schools at the All Saints Cathedral on Thursday.Last year, 577,253 candidates sat KCSE exam but only 88,929 got a mean grade of C+ and above. &ldquo;We must shift from the populist view of white collar jobs,&rdquo; Matiang&rsquo;i said.
