Medium-sized Diamond Trust Bank overcame a tough operating environment in 2016 to post 17.10 per cent growth in net profit largely on increased investment in government securities and increased interest earnings. The group's audited financial results, published late Tuesday, shows that post-tax profit for 123 months through December 2016 rose to to Sh7.73 billion from Sh6.59 billion a year earlier.Loans to customers, however, grew by marginal 4.93 per cent to close at Sh186.30 billion from Sh177.54 billion a year earlier. Net interest income in the review period rose 27.62 per cent to Sh19.39 billion.The lender's investment in government securoities more than doubled, rising 116.58 per cent to Sh74.31 billion.The country's seventh largest lender by market share reported 2.7 per cent rise in customer deposits to Sh238.10 billion from Sh194.05 billion in 2015.The bank&rsquo;s total operating income during the period was Sh24.45 billion up from Sh19.92 billion the previous year, a 22.8 per cent jump. The directors have recommend a first and final dividend of Sh2.60 per share from Sh2.50 previously. The mid-tier lender on Tuesday announced plans to acquire small-sized Habib Bank subject to regulatory approvals, underlining rising consolidation in the industry. In 2015, it benefitted from the collapse of Imperial Bank through increased deposits which propelled it to top-tier league. The Central Bank of Kenya said the transaction is expected to be completed by July 2017. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals in Kenya and Pakistan. &ldquo;CBK will provide further updates as the transaction is progressed,&rdquo; the regulator said in a statement.I&amp;M Bank, another mid-tier lender, has announced a 9.12 per cent growth in full-year 2016 to Sh6.58 billion from Sh6.03 billion in 2015. Speaking following the release of the results, I&amp;M Bank Kenya CEO Kihara Maina said the results were largely satisfactory, given the severe operating environment the industry as a whole was facing. The bank&rsquo;s loans and advances to customers grew to Sh120.92 billion, up from Sh114.93 billion the previous year. The groups&rsquo; assets registered an impressive growth of 10.3 per cent to close at Sh182.1 billion up from Sh165 billion. &ldquo;We are pursuing several strategic initiatives that we believe will place the bank in a better position to counter the various challenges arising from the current operating environment,&rdquo; Maina said. Equity Group managing director James Mwangi said last week that the cap on interest rate last September plunged the banking industry into &ldquo;turbulence from challenges&rdquo; of waning investor confidence following collapse of three lender. He blamed interest controls on the bank's 4.56 per cent per cent drop in net profit for 12 months through December 2016 largely on the interest controls and default on loan by large enterprises.Equity's profit after taxation reduced to Sh16.54 billion from Sh17.33 billion in 2015, the first drop in 11 years.&ldquo;The challenges in the banking industry are beyond challenges. They are turbulence,&rdquo; Mwangi told an investor briefing.
