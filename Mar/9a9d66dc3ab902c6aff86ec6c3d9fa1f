Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry national Chairman Kiprono Kittony says counties are losing investment because of a restrictive business environment.He said businesses at the county level are grappling with double taxation, lengthy and relatively business licensing process, unfriendly trade policies, high cost of credit, poor infrastructure, among other challenges.The chamber, he said, has consequently signed an memorandum of understanding with the Council of Governors in a bid to promote and facilitate increased trade and investment in the counties.This has led to fruitful trade and investment forums in partnership with North Rift Economic Bloc and counties such as Baringo, NOREB, Trans Nzoia, Bungoma, Taita Taveta, Busia, Vihiga, West Pokot, Nyamira ansd Nakuru.Kitonny said the Chamber was advocating for a less restrictive investment and trade environment that makes it easier for enterprises to deliver products to markets. The body is also lobbying for clear business frameworks to expand market value chains, trade standards, and improve collaboration between counties and traders among others.&ldquo;Our focus in the counties is to promote economic growth, help to create jobs, improve living standards, expand the trade opportunities for enterprises growth and develop a robust private sector development in the counties,&rdquo; he said in Kitui. &ldquo;I want to appreciate the commendable work your (Kitui) government is doing in ease of doing business because Kitui was among top counties in the the World Bank report.&rdquo;
