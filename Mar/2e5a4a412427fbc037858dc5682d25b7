Raila&rsquo;s other cousin Carey Orege wants to unseat Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga.The former premier&rsquo;s close allies, including Rasanga, ODM chairman John Mbadi, MPs Junet Mohammed (Suna East), Millie Odhiambo (Mbita) and Edick Anyanga (Nyatike) also face stiff competition.In Kisumu, Ruth faces her boss Jack Ranguma, Senator Anyang&rsquo; Nyong&rsquo;o, businessman Hezron McObewa, Aska Nyangara and Chrispine Ondiek.In Suba, Mbadi will face off with Caroli Omondi, Raila&rsquo;s chief of staff when he was Prime Minister. Omondi, popularly known as Dangote, is said to be the owner of Orange House.Oburu is fighting to unseat MP Gideon Ochanda. He was Bondo MP for 20 years and with his vast experience in politics, he will give Ochanda a run for his money during the April 5 primaries. Ochanda banks on free and fair nominations.Midiwo will face it off with Elisha Odhiambo, engineer Booker Ngesa, Otieno Rading, TJ Okinda and Fabian Oriaro.Millie, one of Raila&rsquo;s strongest supporters, faces Dave Okello, Jim Akali, Ray Obachi, Ayodo Nyabwana and Judy Kamaria at the primaries.raila&rsquo;s BLUE-EYED BOYSuna East constituency, where incumbent Junet is seen as Raila&rsquo;s blue-eyed boy, will fight out with former Migori MP John Pesa.Businessman Patrick Odipo is an independent candidate in a &ldquo;loose alliance&rdquo; with Pesa&rsquo;s supporters to ensure that even if Junet gets the ticket, he will still face competition on August 8.&ldquo;Raila has said this time he will give people a chance to elect leaders of their choice, who he will work with. &ldquo;In the last polls, I won the primaries but the party shortchanged me,&rdquo; Pesa said on January 2, when he launched his bid.According to the alliance, if he is locked out of the primaries in favour of Junet, he will support him, while Odipo will support Pesa to ensure Junet is defeated.&ldquo;I chose to go directly to the people with my development agenda to ensure I get to the ballot, irrespective of how nominations will be carried out,&rdquo; Pesa said.Although Nairobi majority leader and Kileleshwa MCA Elias Otieno has declared interest for the Suna East seat, sources said he was dissuaded to back off in favour of Junet and concentrate on Nairobi politics.Businessman Hezron Onyango will vie on the Ford Kenya ticket. In 2013, ODM lost the Awendo constituency seat to Ford Kenya&rsquo;s Jared Kopiyo, who floored Walter Sirawa.Rongo MP Dalmas Otieno, who was a key decision maker during Migori ODM nominations in 2013 because he was among the architects of Cord, has lost most of his influence after he rebelled against Raila two years ago.He faces strong opposition from businessman Paul Abuor and former student leader at the University of Nairobi David Osiany.In Nyatike constituency, aspirants have called for free and fair nominations. All five aspirants seeking the Orange ticket, including incumbent Edick Anyanga, have urged the party to conduct open primaries.&ldquo;This time round I want to defeat my rivals in broad daylight. Opponents who don&rsquo;t have any political ground have found a scapegoat in primaries, despite always defeating them at the constituency,&rdquo; Anyanga said.Others in the race include Fredrick Ogenga, Tom Odege, Saka Ratteng and Julie Owino. Businessman Olima Bonyo has avoided the ODM nominations headache by joining Ford Kenya.
