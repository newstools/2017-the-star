A Wiper official has dismissed as &ldquo;personal opinion&rdquo; Kitui West MP Francis Nyenze&rsquo;s statement the party wouldquit NASA if leader Kalonzo Musyoka is not picked flagbearer.Leaving is not an option, national organising secretary Robert Mbui told the Star on the phone on Friday.Nyenze&rsquo;s comments &mdash; and seven-day ultimatum issued Wednesday &mdash; raised anxiety the alliance would fall apart.Mbui said Nyenze&rsquo;s assertions were misguided.&ldquo;If it is not Kalonzo, that will be the end of NASA,&rdquo; National Assembly minority leader Nyenze had said. &ldquo;It (NASA) could change into something like Nyanza Super Alliance, because we will pull out.&rdquo; He said he was speaking on behalf of Kalonzo who would not play second fiddle to anyone.However, Mbui said the official party position is to fight it out while still in NASA, not to quit.&ldquo;Nyenze spoke as an Individual and it is within his democratic right to do so, but that is not the position of the party. As a party, we have maintained that we are in NASA to stay and we will fight for presidency from inside, not outside,&rdquo; Mbui said.He said the only people allowed to speak on behalf of the party are the secretary general and the party leader.Mbui said Nyenze&rsquo;s sentiments raised unnecessary anxiety within NASA and the Ukambani region.But some Ukambani residents, told the Star on Friday that ODM leader Raila Odinga to honour the 2013 MoU signed between Cord and Wiper. Under it, Raila would be a one-term President and support Kalonzo in 2017.Machakos town resident Kiilu Mbwika said Raila should sacrifice, just like Kalonzo did in 2013.&ldquo;NASA&rsquo;s formation should not have been to kill the MoU but to strengthen it .... the question of who will fly the NASA flag should be between Kalonzo and Musalia Mudavadi of ANC,&rdquo; Mbwika said.
