Nyamira Senator Kennedy Mong'are yesterday unveiled the National Liberal Party under which he intends to vie for presidency on August 8.He said he stands for the real change that will liberate Kenyans from the yoke of "dynastic leadership for the third and last time.""Jubilee has conned this country for the last five years. We will send them home," he said at Chester House in Nairobi where he launched his party.The symbol for his party is a giraffe, which signifies the towering abilities of his movement to tackle endemic problems facing the country.Mong'are said both President Uhuru Kenyatta and opposition leader Raila Odinga were part of the system that continues to "steal from Kenyans"."They are a cartel bleeding the country dry in turns. You saw how they were smiling at the late Nyeri Governor Nderitu Gachagua's funeral... they know one another," he said.The senator made it clear there is no turning back in his bid to occupy State House. He said he will use his experience as a member of the Senate Public Accounts Committee to deal with corruption."I am the only presidential candidate with a track record, I know which county gets how much and who has stolen," Mong'are said. He blasted governors for overseeing massive looting of public funds, saying their demonstration of might at Gachagua's funeral attested to the same fact."They flew in over 20 choppers yet millions of Kenyans are going starving across the country," he said.Mong'are said Jubilee and NASA exhibits stark similarities."Jubilee and the opposition are one and the same. We have kicked off the long journey that will liberate the country," he said.Mong'are said he will crisscross the whole country to seek for votes."From Kilifi to Mandera, Garissa, Kajiado, Kisumu and Mwingi, we shall walk together," he said.
