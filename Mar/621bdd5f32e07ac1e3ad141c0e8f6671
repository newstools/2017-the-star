Simon Ngige wrapped up his 2017 Barclays Kenya Open campaign with an impressive total of 5 under par 279 to finish joint 35th. The Thika resident professional was indeed the best placed Kenyan among the three, who played in the money bracket category.He shot 5 birdies on holes 4, 15, 16,17 and 18. Ngige&rsquo;s career best performance saw him fire rounds of 67, 73 and 71 in the first three rounds and had his campaign effectively sewn with a last round of 3 under par 68 yesterday.&ldquo;This is my best ever performance in the championship. I have never shot a four under at the Kenya Open. I am usually a morning golfer though and have never been good in the afternoon. I am glad that my game plan worked out really well and I am looking forward to the next year&rsquo;s event with lots of expectations,&rdquo; said Ngige.Rizwan Charania of Windsor savoured his maiden cut on his 13th Open appearance but was not too pleased about his performance in the last round which saw him shoot 4 over par 75. Charania ended his campaign in joint 60th position but believes he gave his all on this year&rsquo;s edition. &ldquo;I started off the last round well but suffered four bogies in a row on holes 5,6, 7 and 8. It must have been a lapse in concentration or mental fatigue. All in all, I think I played really well in the first three days with which I hit the fairways and greens to the best of my ability. I was solid from the green to the tee, only to stumble in the last round. After Kenya Open, I hope to take up some few invitations as I feel much stronger after the Kenya Open. I have never done the Sunshine Tour and would be more than willing if i am invited,&rdquo; said Charania.It was a bad day at the office for Dismas Indiza, who wrapped up his campaign in joint 54th position after a disappointing 5 over par 76 and a total of 1 under par 283. Yesterday&rsquo;s play saw indiza dip 38 places below the leader board.
