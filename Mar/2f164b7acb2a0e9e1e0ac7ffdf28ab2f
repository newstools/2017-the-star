The tourism ministry may have to reduce foreign marketing trips and domestic campaigns after Treasury slashed its activities&rsquo; allocation in the 2017/18 financial year.CS Henry Rotich has allocated the sector a total of Sh2.7 billion for tourism recovery in the next financial year starting July 1, a reduction from Sh4.5 billion in the current financial year (2016/17) ending June 30, and Sh 5.2 billion in 2015/16.The ambitious mapping of the country&rsquo;s minerals has however received a shot in the arm after Rotich allocated Sh 200 million to kick-start the process, giving hope to the initiative which treasury withdrew its Sh 3 billion in December last year.In his budget speech presented in parliament on Thursday, Rotich said under the tourism recovery budget, Sh 1 billion will go towards tourism recovery while Sh1 billion will be channeled towards &ldquo;sustaining new markets and sitting booths&rdquo;.Sh 600 million has been set aside for capital lending to hoteliers, through the Tourism Finance Corporation, for hoteliers to improve and upgrade their facilities. Fort Jesus has received Sh100 million for its refurbishment.&ldquo;The tourism sector has picked up with significant rise in conference activities and foreign tourist arrivals,&rdquo; Rotich said.&ldquo;To further realize the multiple benefits of a robust tourism sector, the government working with key stakeholders in the industry, will continue to promote and develop new areas of tourism including sports, beach and medical tourism.&rdquo;International tourist arrivals to Kenya, between January and December last year, increased by 16.7 per cent to 877,602 compared to 752,073 arrivals in 2015 and 1.35 million in 2014. The number of visitors to Kenya was 1.5 million in 2013, 1.7 million in 2012, and 1.8 million in 2011.The sector has suffered a four-year slump over insecurity.Tourism Cabinet secretary Najib Balala and the Kenya Tourism Board have been on a charm offensive, with increased activities in Europe, the US , Asia and African markets to woo back visitors.The mining ministry has also been allocated Sh150 million for geological databank,Sh 103 million for a mineral certification laboratory and Sh 140 million for mineral audit support. A further Sh140 million has been set aside for acquisition of survey equipment.&ldquo;We expect a further Sh 6 billion support from China for Geo mapping once discussions are concluded,&rdquo; Rotich said.The Treasury has directed the Mining ministry to consider a previous Memorandum of Understanding with China&rsquo;s Geological Exploration Technology Institute, to carry out the survey with a grant from Chinese government.The Mou signed on August 13, 2013, spearheaded by the then CS Najib Balala and GETI president Jia Xuetian, did not materialise as the project failed to take off because of lack of funds.GETI was to undertake an aerial survey for between 24 and 36 months at an estimated cost of $70 million (Sh7.2 billion).Mining CS Dan Kazungu said a team of 16 Kenyan geologists has started putting in place a manual to guide the process.
