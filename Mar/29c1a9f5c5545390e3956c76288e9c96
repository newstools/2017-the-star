Bullying in secondary schools took centre stage during a debate organised by Gatundu North professionals for MP and ward representative aspirants at the weekend.The debate took place at St Francis Primary School on Saturday. National Association of Private Universities secretary general and MP aspirant Vincent Gaitho called for an overhaul of secondary schools.He said the Alliance High School case is only the tip of the iceberg, and other institutions need to be investigated. Gaitho urged students to uphold integrity.Media personality and aspirant Annie Wanjiku urged the TSC to sack teachers who enable bullying. She also urged school administrators to allow students to elect their own leaders.&ldquo;Hearing about bullying in high schools, and especially at one of the most prestigious schools in the country, is appalling and shocking. We pray the right action will be taken against the culprits because the acts performed are tantamount to criminal activity,&rdquo; Wanjiku said.She added, &ldquo;We are living in denial, because these things have been happening and it&rsquo;s high time education stakeholders deal with this menace head on because it all comes down to values.&rdquo;Aspirant Francis Mungai urged parents to teach their children values and encourage them to be their brother&rsquo;s keeper.Hopeful Henry Mbote said it is unfortunate that prefects, who are entrusted with taking care of their peers, are the ones bullying fellow students.He said it is a reflection of tomorrow&rsquo;s leadership.&ldquo;It is a fact that Alliance High School produces the best leaders in the country. Therefore, Kenya&rsquo;s future leadership will be in danger should the inhumanity in the school persist,&rdquo; Mbote said.
