Construction of a 15km road within Mokowe town, Lamu county, will begin in two months, the Kenya Urban Roads Authority has announced. The road will lead to the county headquarters, which has been moved from Lamu Island to Mokowe. Kura acting director general Silas Kinoti said on Monday the road will cost Sh1.2 billion. “Kura is very concerned with the development of marginalised routes in all urban areas. Currently, we are focusing on county headquarters,” he said. “Once we have a road of such magnitude in an urban area, we believe it will make a lot of difference, not only at the Mokowe county headquarters but even the Mokowe trading centre will greatly be transformed.” Kinoti, who was speaking in Lamu on Monday, said the project will be complete in two to three years. Ten young people from Lamu will be sponsored and trained to work on the project. He said they have also requested the Lamu government to provide office space and land for a children’s park. “... very soon there will be many vehicles in this region due to the mega projects that are ongoing. We want to train the children at a young age to enable them manage traffic,” Kinoti said. “These are just a few of the initiatives or the goodies that Kura has for this region.” Governor Issa Timamy praised Kura, saying the road will be a game changer for economic and social development. Kura is a state corporation under the Ministry of Transport, Infrastructure, Housing and Urban Development. It is responsible for the management, development, rehabilitation and maintenance of national urban trunk roads. Its mandate is to provide quality, safe and adequate urban roads network. The authority is funded by the Exchequer and development partners.
