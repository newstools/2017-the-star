Mombasa Deputy Governor Hazel Katana has denied stealing county furniture.Governor Hassan Joho, who has been in the US for a week, is expected to land in Mombasa on Sunday and will be met by controversies revolving his deputy's alleged attempt to take away furniture belonging to the county government.The incident happened on Wednesday evening, when two men were accosted by county inspectorate officers as they carted away some furniture.Katana said the furniture consisted broken chairs that had been outside her office, next to the county assembly building.She said the decision to move the furniture was made by county officials, who called her staff to implement the directive.&ldquo;I received the information last evening and I have nothing to do with the issue ... One of my staff had received a call that the furniture was to be taken to the county yard for disposal. I&rsquo;m currently following it up to know who called,&rdquo; Katana said.Joho&rsquo;s administration yesterday morning said a vehicle ferrying furniture from Katana&rsquo;s office was impounded by inspectorate officers.ODM party has organised a grand reception for the governor, who is seen as a vocal politician against President Uhuru Kenyatta's administration.He has been accusing Katana of betrayal since the March 2016 Malindi by-election in which the deputy governor was said to be campaigning for Jubilee candidate Philip Charo.Joho was campaigning for Willy Mtengo of ODM, who won the polls.Katana decamped to Jubilee on January 8 and is said to be eyeing the Mombasa senator post. She has been accusing Joho of a smear campaign.Yesterday, the Mombasa county director of communication Richard Chacha said two suspects, who were arrested and booked at the Central police station on Wednesday evening, said they had been sent by Katana.&ldquo;Officers from the Mombasa County Inspectorate last evening impounded a truck loading furniture from the deputy governor&rsquo;s office. The officers confronted the men loading the furniture,&rdquo; he said in a statement.&ldquo;It was not established where they were taking the furniture to. However, the furniture is the property of Mombasa county government and is clearly marked.&rdquo;The impounded vehicle was taken to Tudor Inspectorate yard.Katana has rubbished the allegations as a &ldquo;smear campaign&rdquo;.Mombasa is perceived to be an opposition region and Joho is the self-proclaimed Coast political supremo calling shots in all the six counties.Yesterday, the Mombasa ODM chairperson Mohammed Hatimy said, &ldquo;It is now proven that Joho is the Coastal political supremo. Since he left the country for the US, we have seen the political circles to be rather dry. Newspapers are not even selling.&rdquo;He said the governor will make a stop-over at the Akamba handicraft market after he jets back to the country and ill also make a stopover in Changamwe.Changamwe is important for Joho because of its large Kamba population. He needs their votes. Kambas are in Wiper, which is also in National Super Alliance.After Changamwe, Joho will move to Tudor, then Kisauni and Freretown grounds in Nyali constituency.Nyali MP Hezron Awiti of Wiper also wants to run for governor.
