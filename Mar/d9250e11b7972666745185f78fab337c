Scrapping the Senate will not reduce the bloated wage bill, Butere MP Andrew Toboso has said.Toboso, an economist and a member of the Public Accounts Committee, said the parliamentary budget is below two per cent of the country&rsquo;s income.&ldquo;It is not wise to deal with two per cent and entertain corruption which runs into billions of shillings,&rdquo; he said.Speaking at Eshiraha in Butere on Wednesday while giving out CDF cheques, he asked Jubilee not to interfere with the Senate, which is a constitutional legislative institution.&ldquo;What the government needs to do is to revive industries and create employment opportunities so as to improve the economy of the country,&rdquo; Toboso said.He said more money should be invested in the formal sector, blaming the retrenchment policy for the massive layoffs by companies, which has hurt the economy.The lawmaker criticised the government for misusing the Sh6 billion that was set aside for 2013 election runoff, instead of investing it.Toboso said salaries of elected officials should not be reduced in the next government. &ldquo;Cutting down wages is a short-term solution. Reduction of salaries is a defeatist strategy, which suggests that you are defeated in leadership&rdquo; he said.Toboso said President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto are also to blame for the slowing economy, questioning the source of the huge amounts of money they frequently donate at harambees.
