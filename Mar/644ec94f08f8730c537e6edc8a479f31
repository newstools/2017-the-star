Stray Lions capitalised on the absence of Nairobi Gymkhana&rsquo;s top players to extend their unbeaten run in the Nairobi Provincial Cricket Association (NPCA) Twenty20 tournament with a six wickets win.With both teams losing at least two players to the national team that, currently in India ahead of the International Cricket COuncil World Cricket League Championships match against Nepal, it&rsquo;s the visitors who showed intent to maitain their top-of-the-table status right from the start.Chasing 77 runs, Stray Lions won the match with six overs to spare.Despite looking stronger due to the vast of experience their team had, Stray Lions seemed to take it easy over the hosts who were without Karan Kaul, Lucas Oluoch and Rushabh Patel.The leaders had a slow chase of the target losing four wickets on the way and scoring at less than five runs an over.None of the six batsmen who Stray Lions used in the chase was able to get past the twenty runs mark with Abraham Vadada top-scoring with 18 off 20 balls.Others to get to the double figures were opener Neil Narvekar and Charles Waiswa, who scored 14 each.Last week&rsquo;s centurion Shyam Sungar failed to sparkle in the inning, managing six from twenty balls before falling to Bhavya Thakkar who also dismissed Vadada with 27 runs to win to finish with 2 for 11.Roger Mukasa who has been on top form since the beginning of the tournament also had a poor day in the middle, managing only nine from six balls. Jay Mehta remained unbeaten on seven.Mukasa had earlier led his side in restricting the hosts for 76 for 9 with three wickets.Mukasa dismissed Gymkhana&rsquo;s top scorer Murtaza Abbas before clearing the lower order with two more wickets to finish with 3 for 8.Murtaza scored 26 from 43 balls and shared a third wicket stand of 30 runs with Harsh Patel after they had found themselves in danger at 2 for 2 after two overs.Abisheikh Chidambaram who has been enjoying his inclusion in the team with some good performances once again continued that by claiming 2 for 16 with Gymkhana&rsquo;s second top scorer Raj Savala one of his scalps.His other scalp was Ravikant Khetani whom he had caught on five from eight balls.Skipper Maurice Odumbe praised his players for good character in the match that he said was made tough by the opponents&rsquo; fighting spirit.&ldquo;Gymkhana players fought had throughout the match. They made it look like we underrated them but the truth is that they fought had as a team and took their chances,&rdquo; Odumbe said.
