Governor Hassan Joho&rsquo;s unnecessary quarrels in Mombasa have made it impossible to tackle land injustices and he is not working to solve them, Nyali MP Hezron Awiti has said.&ldquo;Huyu jamaa awache ugomvi. Amepewa jukumu kisheria kutatua mashida za ma squatters (This fellow [Joho] should stop fighting/ quarrels. He has been given the duty of solving squatters&rsquo; problems),&rdquo; he said.The Wiper national treasurer said powerful people in the county government are behind the land grabbing syndicate, but Joho has not made any effort to end the problem.Awiti said it does not add up for a non-native to have large tracts, yet those born and brought up in the area are landless.&ldquo;Current occupants of the Kibarani area subjected to abject poverty and have been living on the piece of land [ 23 hectares] for over 20 years and have been neglected by the county government and, instead, are being evicted from the land,&rdquo; he said.The National Land Commission has not taken stringent measures to tackle the issue, Awiti said.Speaking on Saturday in Changamwe, the legislator said most squatters are frustrated by private developers who have acquired land illegally.Awiti complained that about 20,000 Kibarani residents face eviction and no alternative settlement has been offered.&ldquo;You cannot sacrifice 20,000 people for one individual who has acquired the land illegally,&rdquo; he said.Awiti said the state must repossess the land as the lease has expired.&ldquo;The government must revoke any illegal ownership by the private developers and allot the land to the people,&rdquo; he said.The law states that an individual who occupies land for 12 years without being served a notice by the owner is entitled to own the land. Awiti said such a person cannot be forcibly evicted without an alternative resettlement plan.Awiti said if he is elected governor, he will create jobs for the youth and ensure that the welfare fund is given to the elderly.&ldquo;I will deal with the never ending drug menace in the county,&rdquo; he said.Joho was unavailable for comment. County director of Communications Richard Chacha declined to comment on the allegations.
