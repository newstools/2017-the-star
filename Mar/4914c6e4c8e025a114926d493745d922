The parliamentary Committee on Budget has promised to set aside funds in the 2017-18 financial year to resolve the problem of high fluoride content in water consumed in Naivasha.This emerged when members of the committee held a public hearing in ACK Hall, Naivasha, where the issue dominated discussion. Residents said they have suffered for years because of high levels of fluoride in water.&ldquo;Our children cannot be employed in the hospitality and security sectors due to the coloured teeth, a condition caused by high fluoride levels,&rdquo; resident James Mburu said.Reacting to the calls, Kipipiri MP Samuel Gichigi said the problem is sensitive. He said they will recommend that the state allocates funds to construct a dam in Nyandarua county to serve Naivasha residents.&ldquo;The main issue that came from this meeting is water and as a committee, we shall make sure the government allocates funds for a water dam to resolve the problem,&rdquo; he said.Gichigi criticised the defunct Transitional Authority for failing ito educate the electorate on the duties of the national and county governments.
