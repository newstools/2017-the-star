A rescue operation has been launched after a person jumped off Westminster Bridge for the third time since the terror attack at the iconic landmark last week.The bridge was closed as emergency services rushed to the scene to aid the man, who launched himself off the bridge just before 7pm, although it has now been re-opened as efforts are focused on the water.Metropolitan Police boats have been on the Thames for almost two hours but are still yet to locate the man. Westminster Police tweeted this evening: "Police are dealing with a male who has entered the water from Westminster Bridge. @MPSonthewater are working to trace and rescue this male."The Met's boat service account provide an update two hours later, tweeting: "Despite our very best efforts assisted by @TowerRNLI @NPASLondon @LondonFire and MPSSouthwark officers the casualty has not been recovered."In similar scenes, yesterday a man was said to have jumped from the famous bridge, before a woman jumped less than two hours later. The woman was recovered from the water by rescue teams but a search for the man was called off last night. Yesterday's jumpings came just hours before a march over the bridge, in a show of solidarity to the victims of last Wednesday's atrocities. Four people were killed and dozens more injured in the 82-second assault last Wednesday. Kurt Cochran, 54, Leslie Rhodes, 75, and Aysha Frade, 44, died after Muslim convert Khalid Masood drove at pedestrians on Westminster Bridge.The 52-year-old terrorist was shot dead by armed police after fatally stabbing PC Keith Palmer, 48, in the Palace of Westminster's cobbled forecourt.An inquest for the victims opened and was adjourned at Westminster's Coroner's Court yesterday.
