Education CS Fred Matiang&rsquo;i yesterday said the government will work with the Catholic Church to instil integrity and responsibility in learners.He said these are part of the national and social values they have to espouse.Matiang&rsquo;i (pictured) said schools provide opportunities for character building and moderation.He said learning and religious institutions should impart values, such as trustworthiness, respect, care, fairness, courage, diligence and integrity to learners.&ldquo;Sources of good pillars that will enhance character formation include good role models, social responsibilities, volunteerism, commitment to the divine authority, respect and obedience,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;It would be appropriate for a school to assign creative writing projects on these topics to enable students to write and debate them and define the virtues.&rdquo;Matiang&rsquo;i spoke at the Catholic University during the Catholic Private Educational Institutions&rsquo; Head Teachers and Directors Conference in Nairobi.He said education that promotes holistic development of an individual ensures government&rsquo;s investment in access, equity, quality and relevance of education is greatly improved.&ldquo;Since Independence, the government has recognised education not only as a basic human right, but also as a powerful tool for human resource development that should be geared towards ensuring provision of equitable services to all citizens,&rdquo; Matiang&rsquo;i said.
