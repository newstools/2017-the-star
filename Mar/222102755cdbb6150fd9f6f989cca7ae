Only rains will save city residents from the deepening water crisis, Nairobi Water and Sewerage Company has said.&ldquo;We have reduced supply to the tune of 20 per cent. There is still no rain in the Aberdares where we get our water,&rdquo; chairman Raphael Nzomo said.He spoke on Tuesday when he flagged off five excavators at the company&rsquo;s headquarters in Industrial Area. The equipment will be used to dig drainage systems.The company has tightened water rationing because of the fall in water levels at the Ndakaini Dam, now less than 40 per cent..This has been caused by drought in the Aberdares, Kikuyu and Mt Kenya, the main water catchment areas for rivers feeding the dam.Some residents have accused the company of not sticking to the rationing schedule. They say they go for more than a week without water.But MD Philip Gichuki said, &ldquo;We are trying our best to follow the timetable, but there are challenges. When there is a burst pipe, for instance, we have to disconnect supply until it is replaced.&rdquo;Gichuki said the company has put in place stringent measures against big water users to ensure conservation. &ldquo;We have arrested more than 20 people since we banned car wash business. All those drawing water from us to wash cars have been told to stop before we catch up with them,&rdquo; he said.Nzomo said the amount of water wasted has declined by nine per cent, from 40 to 31 per cent, since the company started rationing in January.&ldquo;The problem has not always been shortage. The problem is non-revenue water. This is water we pump into the system but it doesn&rsquo;t give back or residents don&rsquo;t get it,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;We have old leaking pipes. So actually during this rationing we have found out that the amount of non-revenue water has been reduced.&rdquo;
