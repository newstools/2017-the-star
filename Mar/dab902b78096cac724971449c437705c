Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi has demanded that President Uhuru Kenyatta apologise to residents for “lying” to them over state allocations to the county. Kingi said the President misled Kilifi residents that the county has been receiving Sh9.8 billion every year for four years. Uhuru spoke in Bamba on March 13. In Chonyi on Tuesday, Kingi said, “It came to me as a shock to see the President lie to the people over what the county is receiving. The President should make sure that we get the Sh13 billion we have not yet received if indeed Kilifi was supposed to get Sh9.8 billion [every year]. If it is not true, then he should apologise. “There is no financial year I have received such an amount.” He said in the first financial year Kilifi received Sh5.6 billion. Kilifi North MP Gideon Mung’aro on Tuesday gave Kingi seven days to state how much local revenue the county has collected in four years, or he will sue. Last year, Finance chief officer Ben Kai did not state the local revenue collected, when he was summoned by the county assembly. He walked out of the meeting.
