The Jubilee Party has extended the deadline for submission of nomination papers by another five days, starting Monday.Head of secretariat Raphael Tuju yesterday said the extension was a result of wider consultations to give room to leaders in other parties who have shown interest in joining JP. We know we are a strong party and we are confident of winning the August poll. Our doors are open to all Kenyans. We do not want to leave anyone behind, he said.Tuju said by Thursday about 6,500 aspirants had been cleared, adding that the party received about 11 defectors from NASA within a week.He said Pwoka Wanyonyi, a High Court judge, had been confirmed as the party s National Elections Board chairman.Wanyonyi and a team of eight board members will be sworn in and unveiled on Monday, Tuju said.The team will be responsible for dealing with nominations and engagement with the IEBC.Tuju said though the IEBC had said it was not in a position to conduct the party primaries, it will still offer technical support to JP. The IEBC will still be part of our nomination process. They have to audit our entire process to see if what we do meets professional standards, he said.He said the electoral agency will train JP clerks and provide ballot boxes and papers.Tuju said all non-interim officials in every county will likely be moved to different locations to ensure fairness. Nominations are not a walk in the park. We are committed to ensuring we adhere to the highest standards as possible in terms of fairness and transparency, he said.The party is still grappling with activation of smart cards as most members are missing various steps in the process, Tuju said.He said he was not sure to what extent the party will use the cards in the primaries.Tuju said the party has now been vindicated on its insistence of having a manual backup ahead of the election, following recent reports that some hackers had managed to access bank records. We are concerned that some people were insisting we only have an electronic backup, bearing in mind that some of the identified hackers are closely associated with them, Tuju said.He said it was high time all agencies partnered to ensure hackers do not access the voting system.
