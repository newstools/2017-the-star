"Why have you come with these people ? I don&rsquo;t want to be photographed." These were Jackline Mwende's words when Machakos woman representative Susan Musyoka visited her at Machakos Level 5 Hospital yesterday following reports she had given birth.She gave birth to a baby boy on Tuesday through caesarean section.Mwende hit the headlines last year after her husband Stephen Ngila allegedly chopped off her hands for not bearing him children after seven years of marriage.Charitable organisations went to her rescue, with LG Electronics paying for her new prosthetic hands in South Korea.Reports on her pregnancy became public in February, when Taita Taveta woman rep Joyce Lay led a group of women in handing over a newly built house to Mwende.Mwende was then quick to defend her pregnancy saying that she had cheated her husband in order to try and save her marriage.
