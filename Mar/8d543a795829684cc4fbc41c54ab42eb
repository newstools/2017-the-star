Knut secretary general Wilson Sossion has threatened to sue the Nairobian over a story alleging he dumped his "new wife" after she cheated on him.An article in the Nairobian said Sossion, 48,&nbsp;and his wife Vivianne Kenduiywa had broken up and that the situation was "beyond salvage".But in a video recorded in Bomet county, Sossion said the&nbsp;information was "all lies and malicious"."We are here in Bomet and happy. What is in the Nairobian is a lie and we shall sue the newspaper for malicious damage," Sossion said on Friday in the video in which he appeared with his wife."We are at home and are prepared for the day. I will attend prize-giving at a school."The teachers union boss told the Star by phone that he did&nbsp;know why someone "cooked such stories". The couple got married on April 29 last year at the Attorney General&rsquo;s chambers.&nbsp;This was after Sossion's first wife Monicah died in a road accident in 2010.Thereafter, they held a mega wedding that politicians and influential business people attended.Kenduiywa&nbsp;posted pictures on social media of them touring various parts of the country after the ceremony.But the&nbsp;Nairobian&nbsp;claimed&nbsp;Sossion threw her out of their Villa Franca home two months ago. He reportedly hired detectives after suspecting Kenduiywa was having an affair with another man."Sources close to the couple intimated to The Nairobian that Sossion hired private detectives who unraveled her affair with a wealthy man based in Eldoret," the newspaper said. &nbsp; It reported that despite repeated intervention by the woman's family, Sossion was determined to end the marriage.&nbsp;
