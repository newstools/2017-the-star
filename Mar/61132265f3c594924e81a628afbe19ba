Farmers who rely on subsidised fertiliser in Kakamega may for the second year running fall behind on planting because of delayed supplies.They have not received the subsidised fertiliser and seed launched last week by Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya.Oparanya crisscrossed the county in a chopper from Wednesday to Friday to launch the programme in all the 12 subcounties.But on Monday and yesterday maize farmers were turned away at the ward offices as there were no supplies. Not even the application forms for the subsidy were available.Last year, farmers who had registered for the subsidy planted their crop too late as the supply arrived late.They accused Oparanya of playing political games. The farmers said it was unfair and unnecessary to raise the hopes of the peasant community &ldquo;on false campaign promise&rdquo;.A two-kilogramme bag of maize seed will sell for Sh200 and 50kg bag of Mavuno fertiliser for Sh1,800 at designated points.Oparanya urged farmers to visit the selling points in the 60 wards beginning last week.Agriculture executive Kulati Wangia blamed the delay on logistical problems. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m meeting the regional manager to see to it that fertiliser is at designated stores at the wards,&rdquo; he said.This means farmers who rely on the subsidised fertiliser and seed may be forced to wait longer for the supplies.Wangia said the maize seed is not part of the subsidy offered this year.The farmers said they will be forced to buy from local dealers, who sell a 50kg bag of fertiliser for Sh 3,200.
