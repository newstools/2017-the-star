Kipchumba Murkomen has said he warned Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho against following the President to his functions.The Elgeyo Marakwet Senator said via Twitter on Monday that Joho only went where Uhuru Kenyatta was to gain mileage ahead of the August 8 polls."I told Joho last week that the only service he has delivered to the people of Mombasa is following Uhuru and insulting him," he said."For his re-election, Joho is depending on getting a chance to attend the President's functions. What irony for a man who hates his Excellency."But Murkomen's followers attacked him saying projects in his county had failed."Senator, would you kindly start thinking before you post to become relevant. Joho is the head of Mombasa county," ODM communications officer Philip Etale said.Nicera wanjiru said: "Joho is not seeking sympathy from Uhuru. Indeed these are the dark days. What a shame."Rex Francis&rlm; said Joho's political career had seen him through many elections and that this was not the case for the Senator.Charles Lubash told Murkomen to stop being a sycophant.Uhuru gave Joho a verbal thrashing in his county on Monday, saying he followed him around as if he (the President) was his wife.He said once again that Joho had done nothing for the people and was only hanging on to the national government's coat."Clean the city. Do your job, don't follow us. If he plays with us we will flog him," Uhuru said.More on this; [AUDIO] Stop following me like I'm your wife, Uhuru tells Joho at Mtongwe ferry launchJoho was earlier blocked from attending Uhuru's Mtongwe ferry services launch and was reportedly placed under office arrest until the President left.The Governor claimed GSU officers acted on instructions from Uhuru yet all he wanted to do was represent his people and raise their concerns.Joho has severely criticised Uhuru in the past saying he took praise for development projects he had not initiated.He also said the Jubilee government's war on corruption had turned political at the expense of the many victims in his county.More on this: [VIDEO] Agitated Joho scolds Uhuru, Ruto on drug dealing, says war now politicalAlso see: [VIDEO] Joho claims he is under house arrest until Uhuru leaves Mombasa
