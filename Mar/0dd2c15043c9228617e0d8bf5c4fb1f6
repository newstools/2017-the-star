Mombasa tycoon Ali Punjani has urged a Mombasa court to dismiss a case in which he s charged with fighting with the sons of slain drug baron Ibrahim Akasha.His lawyer Francis Kadima produced a letter, seeking dismissal of the case since Baktash, Ibrahim Akasha and Indian Vijaygiri Goswami are out of the court s control.He said it is public knowledge that the brothers were extradited to the Us to face drug trafficking charges. No one knows when their case will be concluded, Kadima said. My client continues to suffer psychological trauma and anxiety due to the pending charges, he said.Punjani, Baktash, Ibrahim, Abdulsalam Akasha and Goswami denied involvement in the fight.Punjani allegedly assaulted the Akashas and the Indian at the Rahjan Bar and Restaurant in Kisauni on January 1.Punjani denied the charges before senior principal magistrate Francis Kyambia and was released on Sh20,000 cash bail.Baktash, Ibrahim and Abdulsalam and Goswami claimed they were lured to the venue and beaten by thugs armed with guns.Police reports say the fight broke out after the group went to the bar at about 6pm with their cousins.Baktash sustained a deep cut in his head and was rushed to hospital.On February 2, the Akashas and their two co-accused appeared before a court in New York and were charged with four counts of conspiring to import narcotics into the US.Kadima said the parties agreed to withdraw the case, but the police pursued it.Prosecution counsel Peris Maina said they have yet to make further applications.The matter will be mentioned on March 23 for further directions.
