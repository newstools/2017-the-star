Nyali MP Hezron Awiti is torn between ditching Wiper for his newly formed Vibrant Democratic Party or staying put and fighting it out with Senator Hassan Omar for the governor ticket.The MP held a series of meetings with his strategists over the weekend to weigh the pros and cons.On the one hand, he does not want to be seen to betray Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka, but on the other, he also does not want to be seen as a pushover.&ldquo;It was a marathon of meetings that even went up to 1am,&rdquo; a confidante of Awiti told the Star yesterday.Awiti told strategists he has spent a fortune in campaigns, which started about three years ago.The Nyali MP has been meeting different communities, including the business fraternity, as he runs on the platform of inclusivity and unity of different communities in the county.Omar, who is also pushing for the Wiper ticket, is running on the platform of economic empowerment of the youth and uplifting the social status of women, which are aligned to his human rights background.Leaving Wiper, a well-known political brand, for VDP, a new outfit, will be a risky affair whose outcome is not clear.&ldquo;We discussed that move at length because it would mean we have to bank more on Awiti as an individual than the new party should he decide to run with it,&rdquo; said a source who attended the meetings.On the other hand, there is still mistrust over a free and fair nomination in Wiper as Omar is the party&rsquo;s secretary general and has influence within the party.Analysts however say Omar, being a human rights activist, is not known for underhand tactics and always wants to maintain his clean record.When contacted on phone yesterday, Awiti said: &ldquo;We are still meeting over the same. There are developments which will be announced later this week.&rdquo;On Thursday, Awiti was to announce his departure from Wiper, but a call from Kalonzo on Wednesday evening or Thursday morning made him change his mind.&ldquo;I am not leaving Wiper. But I am ready for anything,&rdquo; declared Awiti on arrival at the Moi International Airport in Mombasa on Thursday afternoon.He however later added: &ldquo;I want to warn them, The whip I used to whip ODM is the same one I will use to whip Wiper.&rdquo;In 2013, Awiti ditched ODM for Wiper after getting wind of plans to deny him the ODM ticket to vie for the Nyali seat.He went on to beat ODM&rsquo;s John Mcharo.During the phone conversation with Kalonzo last week, the party leader promised a solution to the impasse with Omar will be reached sooner rather than later.At Mwambila ground on Thursday, Awiti said, &ldquo;I will vie for governor. If Kalonzo will not give me a ticket, another person will give me a ticket.&rdquo;This, analysts say, is an indication Awiti is waiting for the right time to bolt out of Wiper if he feels Omar will be favoured.Millicent Odhiambo, a close Awiti ally who is seeking the Nyali MP seat, said the MP is still weighing his options.Another close ally of Awiti on Monday told the Star they are still on the exit door.&ldquo;Our stand remains the same. We have been meeting over the weekend but at the back of our minds, we are leaving the door open. We don&rsquo;t want to be caught by surprise,&rdquo; said the ally.He said the Thursday rally at Mwambila ground was to prepare the people psychologically so they actually embrace the jumping ship without problems.&ldquo;We had wanted to seek their consent to leave Wiper and we got it,&rdquo; said the ally on Friday.&ldquo;We are on the exit.&rdquo;
