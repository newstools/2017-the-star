Meru woman representative Florence Kajuju has disowned a new study that says miraa chewing causes mental disorders.The report by the University of Nairobi and University of Konstanz, Germany, contradicts that of government scientists that said miraa causes no health problems.Kajuju (pictured) said those who authored the report may not have conducted any research at all.&ldquo;I want to tell those who did that research that a proper research by Kenya Medical Research Institute indicated miraa does not harm humans. Where did they get their findings from?&rdquo; she said.Kemri conducted the study through a government facilitation of Sh38 million. The findings showed miraa has no side effects.Kajuju said the research by Kemri found that the mild stimulant keeps the body and mind alert and one is able to perform their duties well.&ldquo;It brings together the community when people sit together to chew miraa. In Meru if you are a man you must chew miraa as part of dowry requirements when you want to marry. We also give it in the church as offering,&rdquo; she said.Kajuju said the study only wants to paint miraa in bad light. She said she was among the leaders who lobbied for miraa to be made a cash crop.
