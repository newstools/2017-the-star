Tullow Oil has expressed interest in the construction of the $2.1 billion (about Sh215.9 billion) Lokichar&ndash;Lamu oil pipeline, ahead of the company&rsquo;s final decision on long term investment in Kenya&rsquo;s oil.The Firm, which first discovered oil at Ngamia 1 in 2012, plans to make its Final Investment Decision by end of 2018.An FID is a final decision of the capital investment, as part of the long term corporate finance decisions to manage company&rsquo;s assets and capital structure.Tullow country manager Martin Mbogo said the company is keen to be part of the consortium to construct the 891-kilometre (heated) Lokichar&ndash;Lamu crude oil pipeline.&ldquo;Conversations have begun on the construction of the pipeline. We have worked out on a MoU with the government to enable early activities to take place,&rdquo; Mbogo said in an interview on Friday.A Joint Development Agreement for development of the pipeline has been negotiated between the government, Tullow and its partners African Oil and Maersk Oil.Mbogo however said the company is currently focused on the Early Oil Pilot Scheme to be conducted in June, which will involve transporting oil from South Lokichar to Mombasa by road.The firm has stored 70,000 barrels at Ngamia 1 and Amosing 1, for the pilot project. Tullow has floated tenders for the project which will involve transportation of the commodity in tanktainers, a journey that will take between 10 and 13 days.&ldquo;The oil pilot scheme is to understand the technical characteristics of what lies below (oil deposits). The government has requested us to support moving the oil which we are closely working together,&rdquo; Mbogo said. &ldquo;The oil is not for commercial purpose.&rdquo;The Kenya Petroleum Refineries Limited is currently modifying its crude oil storage facilities at Changamwe, in readiness for storage of the crude oil.State Department of Petroleum, Ministry of Energy PS Andrew Kamau said Front End Engineering Design and Environmental studies for the pipeline project are ongoing. Construction is expected to be complete by 2020.&ldquo;Infrastructure is being put in place,&rdquo; Kamau said.The company which has so far drilled 30 wells is still on exploration, appraisal and development of onshore blocks in Turkana.Kenya decided to go solo on the pipeline project after Uganda pulled out in a previous planned partnership.Uganda preferred an alternative Tanzanian route announcing last month that it will export its oil to the market through the Tanga port, leaving Kenya to build its own pipeline to Lamu.The government has set an ambitious 2022 target for commercial oil production and export.
