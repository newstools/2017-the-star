Clan politics is expected to play an even bigger role in who gets elected in Kuria West constituency, following Migori Senator Wilfred Machage&rsquo;s announcement he will run for MP.On February 17, Machage officially decamped from ODM, which sponsored him in the March 4, 2013, general election, back to DP, where he was once national chairman.There are two clans in Kuria West&mdash;Abakira and Abagumbe. The Abakira outnumber the Abagumbe by 8,000 votes. The number of registered voters is 45,000, but it is expected to have hit 50,000 by August 8.In 2013 the incumbent, Mathias Robi, from Abagumbe, comfortably won with 13,156 votes, 44.7 per cent of votes cast. He was the sole contender from Abagumbe. Machage is from Abakira.Robi beat Samson Bohoko of ODM, from Abakira, who got 8,467 votes, which was 28.8 per cent of total votes cast. Jane Moronge of UDF and Thomas Nyangi of TNA shared the remaining 24.9 per cent of votes. All three are from Abakira.Bohoko and Moronge will run for the seat again this year, while Nyangi has stepped down for new entrant Mogendi Sayia in the Jubilee Party, who is also from Abakira.Machage&rsquo;s entry has sent the aspirants back to the drawing board. He is not only a respected leader nationally but even among his people of Abakira.&ldquo;Machage is yet to [go on] the ground, but the respect he commands from the Abakira clan will see him win the bloc over in a single meeting,&rdquo; Isebania MCA Charles Nyange said yesterday. &ldquo;His entry is a complete game changer in Kuria West politics.&rdquo; Nyange is from Abakira. He said they were in favour of Bohoko and had even endorsed him two months ago, but Machage&rsquo;s entry has thrown a spanner in the works.
