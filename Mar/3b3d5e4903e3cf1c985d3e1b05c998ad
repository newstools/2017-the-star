Governor Kenneth Lusaka and three Bungoma MPs have pledged to ensure President Uhuru Kenyatta is reelected to continue his &lsquo;winning&rsquo; track record.&ldquo;We as Luhyas voted in 2013 for our brother Musalia Mudavadi in Amani and we failed terribly. We are still nursing the injuries that we sustained and can&rsquo;t pursue that path again,&rdquo; Lusaka said.&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re telling our people to support Jubilee and help form the next government.&rdquo;Lusaka, MPs John Waluke (Sirisia), Boniface Otsiula (Bumula) and woman representative Reginalda Wanyonyi on Monday said the Jubilee administration has done a lot in Bungoma and countrywide and deserves another term.They spoke in Matili, Kimilili constituency. They organised a series of rallies to woo residents to support the President and popularise the Jubilee Party.Lusaka, the JP point man in Western, said the poll will be a two-horse race between NASA and Jubilee.He said during the voter registration, Jubilee managed to register nine million votes in their perceived strongholds, while NASA only managed 1.4 million. He said this clearly shows Jubilee will win.It&rsquo;s unclear how the governor arrived at these figures.&ldquo;We call upon our people to vote Jubilee back in power because of the many things it has done for our people by uplifting their living standards,&rdquo; the county boss said.&ldquo;As Bungoma residents, we asked for the tarmacking of Chwele&ndash;Lwakakaha, Mungachi-Buyofu roads. It is ongoing as we speak. We asked for a charter for our Kibabi University and we received it.&rdquo;The Jubilee administration has assisted residents by reviving the long stalled Webuye Pan Paper Mill, he said.The firm was renamed Rai Paper.&ldquo;I live in Webuye and people have been spreading propaganda that Pan Paper does not work, yet it was opened by the government,&rdquo; Lusaka said.&ldquo;Its first phase operates recycled paper and has employed more than 600 youths. In two years, it will be up and fully operational.&rdquo;He criticised leaders, specifically Ford Kenya boss Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula, for failing the county despite having been in government for many years.&ldquo;Our senator was the Foreigner Affairs minister and did nothing for residents,&rdquo; Lusaka said.&ldquo;Wetang&rsquo;ula has been in opposition for only five years and he is feeling the heat.&rdquo;Lusaka urged the NASA principal to join Jubilee, saying, &ldquo;We are tired of being out in the cold and voting for the opposition every time, with no meaningful development.&rdquo;Waluke said residents will vote for Jubilee because &ldquo;they have opened their eyes.&rdquo;&ldquo;We will ensure we popularise this party across the nine constituencies by having campaigns that will make our NASA brothers escape to Uganda,&rdquo; he said.The legislator said the community can only vote for NASA if Mudavadi or Wetang&rsquo;ula is the alliance candidate.&ldquo;We have been neglected and left out in the cold since independence. The Jubilee administration has remembered us through many development projects.&rdquo;Otsiula urged residents to join Jubilee and promote its agenda.Wanyonyi told JP supporters to unite to strengthen the party and sell its agenda in a civilised manner.
