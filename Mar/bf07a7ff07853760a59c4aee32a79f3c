Naivasha residents were treated to a bizarre incident after a man chopped off his manhood and threw because it was of no value to him.The middle-aged man from Karai trading centre on the Nairobi-Nakuru highway tried to use a razor blade but when he realised it was not effective he turned to a knife.Screams from the Akorino's one-roomed house attracted the public who called the police after they found him writhing in pain.Blood oozing from his private parts had soiled his pair of trousers and household items before he was taken to Naivasha Subcounty Hospital.Joseph Chege, a witness, said the man worked in one of the quarries and never interacted with residents.&ldquo;The Akorino man claimed according to the scriptures, one should discard any part of this body that might deter him from entering into heaven,&rdquo; he said.Chege said despite dismembering his manhood, the man gained composure shortly after and even ate a slice of bread and soda before police came to his rescue.James Kabono, a leader in the area, said they are still trying to come to terms with the man's act. Kabono said the man, who sad he was a born-again Christian, didn't shake hands with people and was always aloof. &ldquo;He has decided to cut the most important part of the body and we are still in shock as to whether he ate it or he threw it in a latrine,&rdquo; Kabono said.A woman at the scene said the man was impotent hence his decision to severe the body part.Speaking on the phone, the superintendent in charge of the hospital Dr Joseph Mburu said the man had been admitted in a serious but stable condition.&ldquo;The man was wheeled to our theatre. We hope he will recover,&rdquo; Mburu said.
