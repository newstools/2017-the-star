The DPP&rsquo;s office yesterday said it will appeal two acquittals of Kabete MP Ferdinand Waititu of charges of hate speech and incitement to violence.Waititu was aquitted on Wednesday of hate speech, incitement to violence and calling for eviction of Maasais from Kayole estate, Nairobi, in 2012.It was his second acquittal in little more than two weeks. On February 20, a court cleared him and Gatundu MP Moses Kuria. The two were accused of alluding to the physical injury and death of opposition leader Raila Odinga at Kasarani Gymnasium on June 13, 2016.They were among eight legislators accused of hate speech.In both cases, the court said evidence was insufficient.But DPP Keriako Tobiko said the ruling on February 20 was a &ldquo;severe setback&rdquo; in the fight against hate speech. He said he would appeal the acquittal.Yesterday, his office said it was preparing to appeal both acquittals.Yesterday, magistrate Joyce Gandani terminated Waititu&rsquo;s case on the grounds the prosecution failed to prove the charges. Waititu was charged after making comments the prosecution said led to the slaughter of two members of the Maasai community. He was also accused of calling for the eviction of the Masaais. Waititu was then the Embakasi MP.The prosecution presented five witnesses, all police officers, but they could not prove those who killed the two Masaais were incited by Waititu. &ldquo;There is no directed evidence the accused incited the public,&rdquo; Gandani said. She said no video recording was produced in court as evidence.The person who took video disappeared.Former Kayole deputy DCIO chief inspector John Wainaina had told the court Waititu urged residents to kick out all Maasais.A man allegedlly had been killed by a Maasai security guard, creating an uproar. At that time, Waititu addressed a crowd.
