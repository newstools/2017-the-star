The Mombasa government has accused the Kenya Revenue Authority of double taxation. The county moved to court seeking orders restraining KRA from instructing two banks to collect Sh173 million revenue on its behalf. Lawyer Paul Buti wants the court to prohibit KRA, its servants or agents from enforcing agency notices of decisions against it.He said his client received a letter from KRA issuing agency notices to Kenya Commercial Bank and Cooperative Bank to recover Sh173 and Sh101 million respectively. &ldquo;By two sets of agency notices dated January 27 and February 3, the respondent demanded the same amounts of money twice in alleged taxes owed by the applicant,&rdquo; reads the application. &ldquo;It is evident and clear that the sum of tax allegedly claimed by KRA is Sh173 million.&rdquo; The county said if the two banks honour the notices at the same time, a total of Sh346 million will have been paid, which will be double the amount claimed by KRA. Buti said on February 3, through Aisha Salim, KRA wrote to his clients via Kenya Commercial Bank and Cooperative bank for recovery of Sh 101 million tax in arrears.
