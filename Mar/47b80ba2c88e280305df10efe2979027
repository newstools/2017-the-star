The Karen and Lang&rsquo;ata District Residents&rsquo; Association has accused Nakuru nominated MCA Alice Ndegwa of illegally putting up hostels in the area.Zoning rules in the area do not allow multiple-storey buildings. The site is near the Lang&rsquo;ata South Road, 300 metres from the Nairobi Academy. A resident said, &ldquo;She is targetting students from the Catholic University of Easten Africa and Tangaza College. These hostels will crowd the area and destroy the serene environment.&rdquo; The group said it reported the matter to the Nairobi government and Nema and a stop order was issued by the county in November last year. &ldquo;We went to court and our views were supported. This area has a local physical development plan that does not allow hostels, apartments or hotels,&rdquo; the association said. Residents said such developments require a stakeholder forum, a change of user and Nema licence, none of which were obtained. Ndegwa was unavailable for comment.
