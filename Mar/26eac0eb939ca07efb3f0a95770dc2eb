Gareth Southgate held heart-to-heart talks with frustrated Ross Barkley in an attempt to assure him of his England future.The Everton man was one of only two players from Southgate&rsquo;s original 26-man squad not to play in the recent internationals against Germany and Lithuania.Indeed, being constantly overlooked has left Barkley deeply frustrated.Barkley knows all he can do is to continue playing well for Everton and hope his chance will arrive.And Southgate has admitted he had a private word with Barkley after last week&rsquo;s defeat in Germany in a bid to keep him positive.&ldquo;I had a good chat with Ross (on Saturday) because he&rsquo;ll be a bit frustrated not to get on against Lithuania,&rdquo; Southgate said.&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a player I&rsquo;d wanted to get him into the game, so firstly he&rsquo;s earned his call back into the squad because he&rsquo;s been playing well with Everton. I think he is a player that can make things happen around the edge of the penalty area.&rdquo;&ldquo;But the changes against Lithuania, I felt we needed to stretch the opposition more and to create space for the likes of Dele (Alli) and Adam (Lallana) to play.&rdquo;&ldquo;I was going to be bringing on another player that plays in front of the defence if I put Ross into it, so that&rsquo;s why I didn&rsquo;t put him into the game. But we like him, he&rsquo;s a talented player and he&rsquo;s just got to keep playing well.&rdquo;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve actually had the chance to work with him. I never worked with him with the Under-21s, so I think it was good for him to get a feel of how we work, how we want to work and he&rsquo;s just got to keep playing well for Everton.&rdquo;
