Drama broke out at Kiandutu slums in Thika on Thursday as angry youths pelted stones at government officials.The officials were in the area to look into the erection of illegal structures along Thika-Garissa road near Broadway High School.The team included security officials, roads and planning officers as well as KeNHA officers.Thika West deputy county commissioner Tom Anjere was unable to address the youths who were armed with pangas and crowbars.The mob demanded to be addressed by their MCA Kennedy Mwangi whom they said allocated them the road reserve for business.They said no amount of force would push them out of the site as it is a "no man's land".Sensing hostility, Anjere and his team fled the scene, leaving the area chief and other officials at the mercy of the unruly youths.No one was injured as youths pelted government vehicles with stones during a hot pursuit that saw the officials take off.When contacted, Kiambu county secretary Fredrick Kitema said the multi-agency team made a decision to clear all road reserves.He said no one would be allowed to put up structures along any highway, citing the Naivasha accident where 50 people died after a fuel tanker crashed into several vehicles."Any politician allocating spaces to vendors along dangerous sections should look for an alternative place to take them," he said.He also said Kiambu county has spent millions of shillings constructing walkways along all major roads in the county and encroachers will not be allowed to put up structures endangering the safety of pedestrians.But the MCA defended his decision, saying his office had already set aside money to construct a fence around Garissa Road Primary School, which borders the controversial area.Mwangi said he had already consulted senior county officers and was given the go ahead to allocate vendors the space.
