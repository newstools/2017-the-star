Flooding in parts of Western Kenya could worsen after the weathermen predicted the rains will continue for another seven days.Several areas have already flooded in the last week, including Budalang&rsquo;i.&ldquo;They are expected to experience sunny intervals in the morning and afternoon showers and thunderstorms over few places throughout the forecast period,&rdquo; acting director of meteorological services Peter Ambenje said.The rains have particularly been intense in the Lake Victoria Basin and parts of the Rift Valley.Ambenje said last week, a station at Chebisaas Girls High School in Uasin Gishu county recorded the country&rsquo;s highest seven-day rainfall of 134.9mm.&ldquo;Compared to the previous review period, there was a significant increase in rainfall amounts over Western Kenya and the Rift Valley, while the rest of the country recorded decreases,&rdquo; he said.Ambenje said the Central Highlands including, Nairobi area, Meru, Embu, and Tharaka are expected to experience sunny intervals in the morning throughout the forecast period. There is a possibility of afternoon showers in a few places throughout the forecast period.Northern Kenya will remain dry throughout, but the Coast could experience light showers.There is hope the rains might continue into the long rains season, which should begin in two weeks time in most parts of Kenya.The meteorological department said distribution of rain between March and May will be poor, but flooding may occur in parts including Budalang&rsquo;i.&ldquo;We are not out of the woods yet. The distribution of the seasonal rainfall, both in time and space, is expected to be generally poor over most parts of the country,&rdquo; Ambenje said.Sunny and dry weather conditions will be dominant over Northeastern and the Coastal regions in March, but a pick up in rainfall is likely to occur over Western Kenya.Ambenje said food security could deteriorate over most parts of the country, especially the Northern areas.&ldquo;Water scarcity is also expected to continue, while the current problem of malnutrition may be on rise in the same areas,&rdquo; he said.President Uhuru Kenyatta declared drought a national disaster last month, and asked for local and international help.He urged stakeholders to support the government by up-scaling drought mitigation programmes.&ldquo;Support from our partners would complement efforts in mitigating the effects of drought,&rdquo; he said at State House.
