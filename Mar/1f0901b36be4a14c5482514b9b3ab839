Lecturers are now demanding that 40% of the Sh10 billion offered by the government be allocated as an increment to their basic salary.This is after the Inter-Public Universities Councils Consultative Forum revised the allocation formula.The team apportioned 16.5 per cent as salary increment for professors and 19.5 per cent for assistant lecturers and tutorial fellows.Previously, IPUCCF had allocated 3.2 per cent as compounded increment on basic salary and 1.6 per cent on house allowance for lecturers and non-teaching staff.This was to be paid to members of the three unions namely Uasu, Kusu, and Kudheia. The tutors later presented a counter-demand for a 30 per cent compounded raise and a 20 per cent compounded increment on house allowance.The house allowance and the raise on basic salaries are the subject matter of the ongoing strike in push for the government to implement the 2013-17 CBA.The lecturers have been on strike since January 19.UASU secretary general Constantine Wasonga said IPUCCF informed them on Tuesday that their earlier demands were squashed by the salaries commission."The government is presenting the Sh10 billion offer but dressed in different mathematics. It addresses nothing other than basic salary. It is an old wine in new wineskin," he said.IPUCCF has however expunged the employer&rsquo;s pension contribution as being part of the Sh10 billion under the new arrangement.Wasonga said scrapping house allowances is unfair to lecturers, adding that the Sh10 billion be spent on academic staff only.The dons want members of their sister unions, which comprises of non-teaching staff, be given their package as well.He spoke after the lecturers marched to Deputy President William Ruto&rsquo;s office to present a petition of their grievances.They also presented a copy to the Ministry of Education at Jogoo House."UASU appeals to the government, specifically the Deputy President&rsquo;s office to assist in this matter," Wasonga said."We think a 40 per cent increment in harmony with other sectors would afford a speedy compromise for learning to resume in universities," he said.Wasonga said that in as much as they appreciate the new offer on the basic salary, the basis for calculating the increment are low and vary in some universities.The dons also raised questions about the fate of the Sh4.8 billion that was given by the National Assembly's Budget and Appropriation Committee."Our strike is still on. We will not bow to intimidation by university administrators," the UASU boss said.Read: Lecturers to decide accepting Sh4.8 billion state offer to end strikeAlso read: MPs cut budgets to cater for lecturers, doctors strike and drought
