The IEBC has opened a window for aspirants who lose at the primaries to run as independent candidates.On March 17, the commission published notices in the Kenya Gazette for the six levels of election - President, senator, MP, woman representative, governor and MCA - and listed the deadlines candidates must meet.Parties are to complete their primaries for all seats by April 26, while independent candidates should present their names by May 10.&ldquo;Candidates intending to participate in the General Election as independent candidates should not be members of any political party by May 8, 2017, being three months before the election,&rdquo; the notice reads.Aspirants who lose at the primaries have 12 days to resign from their parties and run as independent candidates.In September last year, MPs changed the election laws to bar party hopping by adjusting timelines.The changes, however, did not affect the timelines for the submission of papers by independent candidates, creating a window.Many candidates prefer to run on the ticket of the most popular party in their regions to increase support.The Council of Governors filed a case at the High Court, causing the suspension of the party hopping law.The IEBC has urged the court to dismiss the case.Governors said denying politicians the right to move to other parties is unreasonable and unjustifiable.The IEBC said the CoG has failed to demonstrate how the law infringes on anyone&rsquo;s freedom of association.The court issued temporary orders stopping the commission from implementing the law, but the commission said the directive should be lifted.&ldquo;There are alternative avenues, including contesting as an independent candidate, if one is not pleased with a political party,&rdquo; the IEBC said in court papers.Further, the commission contends that the timing of party hopping has constitutional underpinnings.The law barring politicians from ditching parties after losing in the nominations triggered a wave of defections countrywide. The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission has given parties until April 5 to present the names of aspirants who will participate in primaries for publication.The IEBC has also set the official campaign period between May 28 and August 5, which is 48 hours before Election Day.The campaign time is between 7am and 6pm.In the notices, the IEBC confirmed elections for all six elective posts will be held on August 8.
