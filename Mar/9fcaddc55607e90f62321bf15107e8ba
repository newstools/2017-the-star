Some 700 nurses in Homa Bay county have gone on strike over the deplorable state of the Homa Bay Referral Hospital.They held a peaceful demonstration in Homa Bay town on Thursday.Kenya National Union of Nurses branch secretary George Opiyo said they will not get back to work until all the issues raised are resolved."Look at the state of the Homa Bay County Referral Hospital for the past two years since the start of its renovation, there is no improvement. The facility is in a pathetic situation, he said.Other issues include lack of equipment and supplies and irregular disbursement of funds by the county government. The nurses said this has hindered the effective provision of health services."Relatives are most of the time sent to buy medicine and other non-pharmaceutical commodities from outside the hospital at night, which is very dangerous," Opiyo said.Branch chairman Samuel Olang'o Ogalo said, Because nurses are the advocates of the patients in all health care settings, we will not sit back and watch while health facilities are in the deplorable condition and the public is suffering."Secretary Lilian Ogutu urged the county to employ 500 nurses to curb shortage.
