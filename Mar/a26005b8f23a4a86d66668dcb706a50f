Safaricom has invested Sh15 million in sponsoring the tournament over the last three years in line with its desire to support events that raise Kenya’s profile as a choice destination for golf professionals and enthusiasts, as well as create broader appeal for the sport locally. “We have enjoyed a great relationship with the organisers of the Barclays Kenya Open and we are optimistic that the golfers will deliver an excellent show over the four-day tournament,” said Ms. Mulinge.
