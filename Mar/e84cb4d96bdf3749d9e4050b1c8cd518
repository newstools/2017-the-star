In 2016, the EIB made available over Sh235 billion in long-term financing for projects in Africa.The EIB&rsquo;s three-day programme will include a site visit to Lake Turkana Windpark, the largest windfarm in sub-Saharan Africa developed by the private sector, which the EIB helped finance in 2014.The lending institution also committed itself to finance, upgrade and widen the Port of Mombasa access road, between Mombasa and Mariakani, a 42km stretch.The project aims to improve safety on the road and reduce congestion which causes delays for goods headed to Mombasa. The project is co-financed by a concessional loan of Sh5.5 billion approved by the German Government and to be provided by KFDW Development Bank, as well as an EU grant contribution and a loan from African Development Bank.At Treasury, the EIB signed the &ldquo;Last Mile Connectivity&rdquo; project, which will connect nearly 300,000 households (up to 1.5 million Kenyans) to the national electricity grid.EIB Vice President Pim van Ballekom, responsible for operations in East Africa, said Kenya is increasingly becoming a hub for the region on many levels. Other projects the bank has committed to will improve access to Mombasa harbour and support geothermal energy at Olkaria.
