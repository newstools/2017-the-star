Governor Kenneth Lusaka has warned all striking Bungoma doctors that they will lose their jobs on Monday if they do not return to work.Doctors have been on strike since last December in a push for the government to honour a CBA signed in 2013.Their demands include a 300 per cent rise in pay, better working conditions and the provision of facilities for Kenya's public hospitals.The government has made them offers but they have turned them down saying only the fulfillment of the CBA will see them return to work. But the document was not registered.More on this: State withdraws Sh14.5b offer for striking doctors, to hire workers afreshAlso read: Ditch illegal CBA, start fresh talks, resume work SenateLusaka said health workers should return to work as directed by President Uhuru Kenyatta and Council of Governors chairman Peter Munya.He noted that many sick people have died since the strike began on December 5 and said this should no longer be the case."Doctors who have not resumed duty should do so immediately. We will not have any other option but to sack those who will not comply with the President's directive since health is devolved,'' he said.The Governor acknowledged that doctors have needs that need to be met but said they should be humane enough to put the sick before money.He spoke at Sitikho ward in Webuye West constituency on Friday during a ceremony to welcome new Sitikho location chief David Manali.He attended the function alongside Health executive Stephen Kokonya and Education executive Beryl Mutekhele.Kenyatta National Hospital sacked 12 doctors for taking part in the strike and is pursuing disciplinary action against 48 others.Elgeyo Marakwet county will fire 51 striking doctors if they do not resume their duties before Monday, health executive Thomas Ruto said.Read more: Elgeyo Marakwet to fire 51 striking doctorsOn politics, Lusaka asked aspirants to stop campaigning at funeral and respect the dead in line with Luhya customs and traditions.The county chief said some politicians buy cheap liquor for youths and ask them to cause chaos at their rivals' functions and burials.''Have respect and stop fighting at funerals. This is taboo in [the Luhya community],'' he said.''Call a public rally if you want to engage in politics...stop this behaviour of disrespecting the bereaved by causing chaos as was the case in Kimilili last week."Lusaka asked politicians to sell their manifestos instead of causing unrest in the run up to the August 8 general election.He asked Webuye West subcounty commissioner Benedict Munyoli to work closely with the new chief to ensure regular patrols during elections."Let us ensure security is tight to avoid loss of lives and rampant cases of [crime]," he said.Manali said he will work with all stakeholders to ensure services are delivered and that security will be his priority.''We will fight drug use which has ruined many families and youths and are used during political times,'' he said.
