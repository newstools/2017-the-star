Controversial businessman Paul Kobia, arrested yesterday in connection with kidnapping of a Congolese businessman over a gold deal, has been released on Sh100,000 bail.Kobia, a Nairobi Senate aspirant, was arraigned yesterday with four bodyguards before Milimani senior resident magistrate Miriam Mugure.Police reports indicate that on Wednesday night and yesterday morning Kobia and the others abducted Congolese businessman Blanchard Londole.They said Kobia had gone to claim his Sh40 million from Londole, money he had lent him in exchange for gold.Reports indicated Kobia fired twice in the air during the drama at Londole&rsquo;s compound.The victim is hospitalised in serious condition at Nairobi Women&rsquo;s Hospital.Police said Kobia and the others were likely to be charged with abduction, assault, misuse of a firearm and other counts. They were released on similar bail terms or Sh200,000 bond.None pleaded to charges because a psychiatric assessment is required first.Kobia has had other brushes with the law. In 2014 he made threatening statements and reportedly tried to attack Cord leader Raila Odinga. There are also reports of brandishing a firearm.The five were arrested yesterday at about 5am.The court rejected a police request to remand them for 14 days to complete complex investigations.Mugure ordered them to report to Kilimani police station all day for three days.The court heard that Kobia and four bodyguards &mdash; Alvin Anzaya, Nelson Moyi, John Mutwiri and Martin Mwangi &mdash; are being investigated for abducting Londole at his house at Super Lodge along Kindaruma Road, then taking him to Kobia&rsquo;s house along Mzima Springs in Kileleshwa.The prosecution said the five suspects actively participated in the crimes.Constable Mark Ntonja attached to the Kilimani DCI office said the Congolese complainant was assaulted and seriously injured by the suspects.The court heard that on Wednesday at about 10pm Kobia and accomplices went to Londole&rsquo;s house on Kindaruma Road and threatened him with a gun.The firearm has been confiscated by police to establish whether there is a permit for the gun.Ntonja said the suspects forced Londole into their car, while beating him and shouting that they needed their money.Kobia is said to have fired twice in the air after guards at Londole&rsquo;s apartment tried to block their way.Police were then alerted, chased the suspects to the Riverside area and made arrests, the court heard.The case will be mentioned on March 24.
