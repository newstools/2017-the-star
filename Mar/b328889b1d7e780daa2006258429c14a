Six major boreholes that serve 20,000 people in Kitengela and Athi River towns have dried up.A number of homes had connected pipes to the boreholes after the Export Processing Zone Authority started rationing water in January. This was after the Nairobi government announced water rationing.Vendors are making a killing, with a 20 litre jerrycan of hard water selling for between Sh50 and Sh70. Fresh water is sold for Sh100 per 20 litre jerrycan, when available.Most of the people in Athi River and Kitengela are workers at the EPZA and with the little income they get, they cannot afford to make ends meets with the current price of water.Also affected are construction companies, which have stopped work following the shortage of water.Kajiado county has two water towers &ndash; Mt Kilimanjaro and Entasopia River &ndash; but their water does not reach Kitengela because it is far away.Water from Kilimanjaro serves Loitokitok and its environs, parts of Makueni and Machakos, and Mashuuru town in Kajiado East constituency.The water from Entasopia only serves the surrounding irrigation farms in Olkiramatian, Nkurruman and Magadi town.Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company supplies water to the EPZA.Most people in the county depend on boreholes and water pans.
