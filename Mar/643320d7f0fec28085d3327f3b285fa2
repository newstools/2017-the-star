More than 11, 000 integrated internally displaced persons have gotten a reprieve after the government promised to compensate them before the August 8 general election.The IDPs have accused the national government of neglecting them. Nakuru county commissioner Joshua Nkanatha assured their officials at a Nakuru hotel yesterday the government has already set aside Sh6 billion.&ldquo;We want your leaders to verify the names and compensation will be made immediately,&rdquo; he said. Nkanatha said his office is working closely with other agencies, such as the National Intelligence Service, DCI and National Registration Bureau to ensure non-IDPs are not compensated. &ldquo;We are employing the services of other government agencies to ensure only victims of the 2007-08 PEV are compensated. Those who benefited from other government compensations and attempt to benefit from the money will face the law,&rdquo; Nkanatha said. He urged the IDPs to withdraw their statement two weeks ago that they will boycott the election if they are not compensated.
