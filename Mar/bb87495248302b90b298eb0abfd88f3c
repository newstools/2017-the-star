The next head of state after the August polls could spend a whooping Sh9.81 billion from the 2017-18 budget allocations to four offices under the Presidency.The sum involves Sh8.7 billion budgets on recurrent spending such salaries and purchase of goods while Sh1.1 billion will cater for development activities.The proposed budget has seen a Sh1.02 billion increase compared to the Sh8.42 billion allocation in the lapsing 2016-17 financial years.State House Administrative Secretary John Makumi defended the budget before the Kamama led committee on grounds merging of the deputy president's office and other state departments such as the Kenya Vision 2030 delivery unit with the Presidency has led to need for more funds."Key outputs expected for State House Affairs include the fulfillment of constitutional mandate of the President, improve infrastructure within State House and Lodges, improved hospitality services, for the office of the first lady's programmes operationalized and effective communication for presidential functions," Makumi said while requesting MPs to approve the allocations.The Presidency says the increment will ensure there is &ldquo;successful transition of power after 2017 general elections&rdquo; in addition to funding its normal activities. The power transition process entails the swearing in of the President-elect.
