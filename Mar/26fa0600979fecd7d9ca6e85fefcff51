Government spokesperson Erick Kiraithe has defended the police against the allegation that they are being used by the state to frustrate the opposition at the Coast.Speaking in Mombasa on Saturday, Kiraithe (pictured) said police act on intelligence.&ldquo;Some politicians have sometimes become wild when police officers issue orders that they cannot hold rallies. Officers are right to advise leaders on when to hold or cancel rallies,&rdquo; Kiraithe said.&ldquo;Politicians need to cooperate with police officers when advised. Police always intervene to ensure that rival political groups do not violently engage each other.&rdquo;He was speaking at KPA Mbaraki Sport Club to explain why the Thursday&rsquo;s ODM rally in Kinango was thwarted by police.Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho, a fierce critic of Jubilee, has accused the national government of using armed police officers to bar him from holding political rallies at the Coast, a region perceived to be an opposition stronghold.On Thursday, police disrupted political rallies organised by the embattled Joho and his Kilifi counterpart Amason Kingi in Kinango, Kwale county.A combined team of Administration Police, regular police and the General Service Unit dispersed a crowd that had assembled at Kinango ready for the ODM rally. Joho condemned the break-up of his Kwale meetings and accused the national government of being behind the scheme. &ldquo;The era of police intimidation is over. They cannot be used to disrupt meetings and cause chaos,&rdquo; he said.
