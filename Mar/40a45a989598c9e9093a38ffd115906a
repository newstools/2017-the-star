Imenti Central MP Gideon Mwiti has launched another attempt to have a rape case withdrawn.Last year, the Court of Appeal upheld a decision of the High Court that dismissed a similar attempt. But on Friday Mwiti said the charge sheet is defective as the prosecution has not categorically stated particulars of the offences.Through lawyer John Khaminwa, Mwiti accused the prosecution of &ldquo;bringing new offences under the Sexual Offence Act&rdquo;, which he said cannot stand in law. Khaminwa said it was wrong for the prosecution to charge his client with assault and intimidation and fail to indicate how the offence occurred.&ldquo;If they are saying my client used force, what kind of force was used?&rdquo; he told trial magistrate Francis Andayi.The hearing will be on April 19.
