Water CS Eugene Wamalwa will not influence Trans Nzoia politics, whether he runs for governor or not, Governor Patrick Khaemba has said.

He said his performance in the past four years is evident for residents to see and give him a second term to serve. God gave us everything in twos because he knew we need them that way. He gave us two eyes, ears, nose, legs and hands. So I'm requesting the people of Trans Nzoia to give me two terms so that I complete the work I have initiated, Khaemba said.Khaemba said his flagship projects include the Kitale Referral Hospital, which is being put up for Sh1 billion and the Kitale bus park. He said the projects are almost complete.Khaemba said he is ready to face his opponents in the Ford-K nominations since he is assured of victory.Businessman Kakai Bisau, former Cabinet minister Noah Wekesa and former journalist Joshua Sang are seeking JP s ticket.Analysts said if Wamalwa will not run for the JP ticket, the governor race will be a two-horse affair between Khaemba and Bisau.
