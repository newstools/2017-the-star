Director of Public Prosecutions Keriako Tobiko has appointed a new prosecutor in the incitement case against Machakos Senator Johnson Muthama (pictured).The entry of senior Assistant Director of Public Prosecutions Moses Omirera has jolted the trial of Muthama, a day after prosecutor Duncan Ondimu said he was being frustrated by the NCIC officers who investigated the case against Muthama. Omirera told trial magistrate Francis Andayi, &ldquo;Not only have I been appointed to lead two other prosecutors, Ondimu and Eddie Kadebe, but has also been instructed to review all incitement cases across the country.&rdquo;Immediately he joined the prosecution team, Omirera applied to have the case adjourned to acquaint himself with the case, which he said was of exceptional public interest. He said he also wants to review the entire case.Muthama and activist Japheth Moroko have been accused of inciting the public against the government over teachers&rsquo; salary increment.They allegedly uttered the words when they addressed a Cord rally at Uhuru Park on September 25, 2015.But defence lawyers John Khaminwa, James Orengo, Jully Aulo, Harun Ndubi and Antony Oluoch protested, saying &ldquo;Somebody somewhere wants Muthama jailed, yet Jubilee MPs Moses Kuria (Gatundu South), Ferdinand Waititu (Kabete) and Kiambu Governor William Kabogo have been acquitted of similar charges.&rdquo;The case will be heard on November 8 and 9.
