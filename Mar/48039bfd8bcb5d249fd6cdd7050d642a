Arsene Wenger has reportedly rejected a record &pound;30million (Sh3.8bn)-a-year deal to manage in China as he is committed to seeing out the campaign with Arsenal.Reports suggest an unnamed Chinese side were prepared to entice Wenger away from his beloved Arsenal in order to further raise the profile of the Super League.However Wenger has shunned the interest despite his future being up in the air with the Frenchman out of contract in the summer. Wenger is prepared to reject a mega pay-day in China to stay among Europe&rsquo;s elite if he leaves Arsenal this summer.The Chinese Super League have made overtures about adding Wenger to their high-profile roster of managers that already includes Manuel Pellegrini, Luiz Felipe Scolari and Andre Villas-Boas.Any move to China or the Middle East would see Wenger offered deals worth considerably more than the &pound;8m (Sh1bn)-per-year he already earns at the Emirates Stadium.He previously coached in Asia with Japanese side Nagoya Grampus between February 1995 and September 1996 before moving to England. Wenger will instead keep a close eye on the managerial situations at both Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain if he is to leave the Emirates Stadium at the end of the season. The 67-year-old, who has come under criticism from sections of Arsenal&rsquo;s fanbase in recent weeks, said he will consider his future in March or April.His side are fourth in the Premier League but go into their second-leg last-16 Champions League tie with Bayern Munich with a four-goal deficit following their 5-1 defeat in Germany. Arsenal are next in action on Saturday evening when they face Liverpool at Anfield.
