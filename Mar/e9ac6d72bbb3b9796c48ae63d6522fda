Two Murang&rsquo;a governor hopefuls have resorted to using food as bait to woo voters as the Jubilee Party nominations and General Election draw closer.They are incumbent Mwangi Wairia and his main rival and Kigumo MP Jamleck Kamau.Wairia started a maize seed distribution programme two weeks ago with the aim of reaching at least 220,000 residents.He has visited almost all the villages in the eight subcounties as he distributes two-kilogramme packets to each resident.The drive runs from 7am to as late as 9pm. Many residents wake up early to queue for the packet, but some return home empty-handed.The residents are supposed to register at the chief&rsquo;s camp for the seeds, but most go directly to the distribution site. mitigating effects of droughtWairia said the drive aims to mitigate the effects of drought and resulting crop failure that has affected 25,000 residents.&ldquo;We realised we are not able to feed every homestead, so we decided to instead distribute seeds as the rains approach,&rdquo; he said.The maize seeds will yield a harvest that is expected to sustain residents for a year.Kamau has also started a food distribution programme to address the drought situation.On Monday, he distributed five kilogrammes of maize flour, a cabbage and a quarter kilogramme of cooking oil to a group of Ithanga residents.Kamau also distributed 20,000 litres of water to the residents at Ithanga Primary School.He said more than 5,000 residents have received food and water.Kamau said he will also distribute food to residents of Kambirwa, Makuyu, Kakuzi and Gaturi areas.
