Kenya National Police Service and Kenya Revenue Agency clearance certificates should not be used to discriminate against election candidates both inside the ruling Jubilee Party and the opposition.The DCI issues the Good Conduct Certificate and the KRA the Tax Compliant Certificate, without which a candidate cannot run for elective office.But Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho is under scrutiny by the KRA probing his banking transaction details as far back as 2011.Last week, Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko faced the prospect of not being cleared by JP to vie for Nairobi governor, as he lacked the DCI certificate.Sonko received his certificate overnight Thursday after intervention by the powers that be.But Joho&rsquo;s woes look as if they will persist.If one governor faces this level of scrutiny then surely all others should.A return to Kanu&rsquo;s darkest days, when the single party could get even private banks to foreclose loans as a means of invalidating a political candidate, is unacceptable.
