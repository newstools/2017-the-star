Former Starehe MP Margaret Wanjiru has been cleared to seek the Jubilee Party ticket for Nairobi governor. Wanjiru is among those women who have &ldquo;made it&rdquo; in politics in a very patriarchal society, against all odds. She epitomises the idea of &ldquo;strength of a woman&rdquo; in spades!Bishop Wanjiru remains one of the toughest Nairobi women politicians, daring to face Governor Evans Kidero and the likes of Senator Mike Sonko and Peter Kenneth.There is a high probability she will triumph over Kidero if given the JP ticket. Foremost, she is an evangelist who has traversed almost all of Nairobi as a preacher besides being MP. She is popular in the memory of a Nairobi voter unlike Kidero, a newcomer to city politics.Besides, she was in Team ODM Reloaded and traversed the country, which implies that even a voter arriving in the city a few months to the election from upcountry probably knows her, unlike Kidero&rsquo;s.Secondly, unlike Kidero, Wanjiru enjoys the natural support of the tribes that form NASA, with a head start from her Gema community and Starehe constituency. She understands Nairobi politics and as an effective MP, she registered the highest number of votes in the last IEBC exercise.There is the Kikuyu ethnic factor and chances are that Wanjiru will automatically get the backing of this vote bloc, unlike Kidero, who has been branded a Jubilee mole.The second bloc of voters likely to back Wanjiru are all churches in Nairobi and the business community, made up of mostly Kikuyus who are feeling betrayed by the hike in parking fees.Kidero has often been mentioned in graft allegations, which might force the city business community to pull towards Wanjiru.Besides, the NASA fraternity will not want to appear to be setting up a Luo hegemony, where both Kidero and Raila are positioning themselves for the big seats.The enlightened Nairobi electorate and pundits will question where this leaves the Luhya, Kamba and Kisii since NASA ostensibly revolves around these communities.The gender factor is an added advantage to Wanjiru, seeing as she is the most visible woman governor candidate. This may help her transcend the tribe hurdle.Kenyan women are on the path of political enlightenment. They vigorously campaigned for the 2010 Constitution, which guarantees them rights in all spheres of life, including politics.Women happen to make up about 50 per cent of registered voters and as such their political might behind Wanjiru should not be underestimated.Having said that, however, we still live in a patriarchal society where the &lsquo;leader&rsquo; aspect, especially a &lsquo;political leader&rsquo;, connotes &lsquo;man&rsquo;. Women and men have routinely voted for men.This is the sorry state of affairs in most of the world. A case in point being the US, where a very qualified woman, Hillary Clinton, stepped aside for Barack Obama in 2008.Some women might not vote for Wanjiru, especially if the Kikuyu tag sticks.However, the saving grace might be the fact that women are less tribal, and, if properly motivated, it would be easier for them to transcend parochial tribal politics and elect her.If this were to happen, it will kill two birds with one stone: It will deal political tribalism a major blow, uniting Kenyans, and it would start us on the long journey to real gender equality.Gender inequality is a function of power differential, and real power is in politics, where policies are made. Once we have many women in politics, the term &lsquo;leader&rsquo; would gradually gain the hue of &lsquo;personality&rsquo; rather than exclusively man. More women in politics would also lead to gender-balanced legislation.The country would also recognise the many indirect benefits that might accrue to our young daughters in terms of women leader role models courtesy of her leadership.In Wanjiru&rsquo;s candidature the question remains: What will win, gender or tribe?
