A Mombasa-based company has sued the collapsed Imperial Bank Limited seeking more than Sh80 million in rent arrears.Upperview Properties Limited is the registered proprietor of 0.59 acres in Mombasa county. A building known as Mombasa Building owned by Upperview sits on the property.Through lawyer Andrew Wandabwa, the company says it acquired the property from IBL in 2009 and leased it back to the bank, which still occupies the premises.The said property was charged to Kenya Commercial Bank, and the rental income assigned to it.Court papers indicate IBL&rsquo;s lease expired on June 30, 2015, and when IBL was placed under receivership, the collapsed bank refused to pay the accrued rent. Imperial Bank was placed under receivership by the Central Bank of Kenya on October 13, 2015, over massive fraud by the management.&ldquo;By reason of its refusal to execute the lease tendered to it, IBL has become a trespasser, and my client is entitled to mesne profits in respect of the bank&rsquo;s continued unlawful occupation of the premises,&rdquo; Wandabwa says.According to the court documents, Imperial Bank says it is the owner of the property on the basis that Upperview acquired the premises from the dividends declared by the directors of IBL (under receivership), and they knew IBL was not making profits.Wandabwa says Imperial Bank&rsquo;s claim is false, alleging IBL has an ulterior motive to grab the property.He says Kenya Commercial Bank currently holds a charge over the property, a debenture over all his clients&rsquo; assets, and an assignment of the rental proceeds from the property. The company seeks to have IBL evicted or made to pay Sh84,339,682, exclusive of VAT to Kenya Commercial Bank, within a period specified by the court. Imperial Bank was directed to file their response in the case ahead of the hearing on April 21.
