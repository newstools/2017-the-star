The trial against 11 people suspected to have laundered Sh791 million stolen from the National Youth Service began yesterday.At the centre of the hearing was a Range Rover Vogue No. KCB 750Z worth Sh23.4, which the prosecution claims was bought with proceeds of crime.James Charles Oduor, a sales executive at RMA motors, told the court that the high-end luxurious car was bought by John Kago.Prior to Kago clearing the purchase, the court heard that Ben Gethi and an identified woman had enquired for a Range Rover.&ldquo;They wanted a black Range Rover Vogue 5000cc but at that time we had one that had 3000 CC. Ben was not interested. He said it had less features,&rdquo; the witness said.Odour then told senior principal magistrate Martha Mutoko that Kago came later and requested to be shown a car with similar specifications.The luxurious car was only available at the firm&rsquo;s warehouse at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport.And since it was on a weekend, the two agreed to view it the following Monday.That Monday, the two gentlemen visited the warehouse.While questioned during cross examination, Oduor said the contract was in the name of Kago.&ldquo;I never dealt with Gethi. After he was dissatisfied with the features of the car he left and the only person I dealt with after that is Kago,&rdquo; he said.Oduor said Kago took photographs of the vehicle and sent them to an unidentified person, apparently to get an approval to buy it.&ldquo;We agreed to go ahead with the transaction. I told him the procedure and he gave us a bank slip worth Sh10 million from Family Bank,&rdquo; he said.The court heard that Kago also gave him his phone number, ID and pin number and agreed to clear the balance in two instalments.Oduor said the car was handed over to Kago a few days later after he paid the balance.He, however, found himself in a tight position after lawyer James Wagala asked him to explain why his initial statement never mentioned some of the things he said yesterday.&ldquo;I have not created evidence. I have said what I told the officer who recorded my statement,&rdquo; Oduor said.In the case, Kago, Gethi, businesswoman Josephine Kabura, lawyer Patrick Ogola and seven others are facing charges on money laundering.
