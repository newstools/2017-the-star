Is it KSh50 billion, KSh40 billion or KSh33 billion?The Star Newspaper reported a claim made by the Deputy President William Ruto that Turkana County has received more than KSh50 billion since its inception. The claim was a major source of discussion by area leaders who claimed that much of the cash has been wasted or mismanaged under Governor Josphat Nanok&rsquo;s administration.Even before the dust had settled, President Uhuru Kenyatta visited the area and claimed that his government had disbursed KSh40 billion to the county in the last four years.On his part, Governor Nanok has maintained that the county has only received KSh33 billion from the national government in the past four years.Based on these claims, we ask, how much money has Turkana County received since its inception?PesaCheck, with input from the International Budget Partnership (Kenya), has investigated these claims. We find that the claim by the President is partially true, the one by the Deputy President is false, and the claim by Turkana Governor to be plausible.The Kenyan Constitution provides for the equitable sharing of national revenue, where the revenue raised nationally should be shared equitably between the national government and the county governments. The county governments can also receive additional allocations from the national government&rsquo;s share of revenue whether conditionally (conditional grants) or unconditionally.The Constitution also provides for the mechanism to divide the equitable share of revenue through the Division of Revenue Act. The county governments&rsquo; equitable share, and any additional allocation from the national government, is then divided among the 47 counties through the County Allocation of Revenue Act. These two documents should be prepared every year and approved by Parliament within two months before the end of the current financial year.The County Allocation of Revenue Act outlines all the revenue allocations for each of the 47 counties. Each County Allocation of Revenue Act from the financial year 2013/14 to 2016/17 provides the information necessary to follow up on these allocations.For the financial year 2013/2014, Turkana County was allocated KSh7,664,402,594 as equitable share. It received additional revenue as conditional grant from national government&rsquo;s share of revenue totalling KSh229,995,474 . The total amount comes to KSh7,894,398,068.The County Allocation of Revenue Act 2014 allocated KSh9,143,334,208 to Turkana County as equitable share in the financial year 2014/2015. Additional funding in the form of conditional grants from the national government&rsquo;s share of revenue totaled KSh91,802,418. The total allocation comes to KSh9,235,136,626.Turkana County was allocated KSh10,479,033,426 as equitable share and KSh208,793,792 in conditional grants in the financial year 2015/2016. The conditional grants comprised KSh176,237,092 from the national government and KSh32,556,700 in loans and grants from development partners (World Bank, DANIDA). The equitable share and the conditional grants add up to KSh10,687,827,218.The County Allocation of Revenue Act 2016 has allocated KSh11,307,010,771 to Turkana County as equitable share and KSh305,112,887 as conditional grants for the financial year 2016/2017, which is the current financial year. The conditional grants are KSh231,818,905 from the national government and KSh73,293,982 from development partners. Therefore, the final allocations to the county in 2016/17 are KSh11,612,123,658For the financial year 2015/16 and 2016/17, we omitted the conditional grant for leasing of medical equipment allocated to Turkana County that totals to KSh95,744,680 and KSh95,744,681 respectively. This is because the money for leasing of medical equipment does not go to the counties. The Ministry of Health implements the fund on behalf of the county governments.The table below aggregates the dataTotal revenue allocations to Turkana County in the last four yearsTherefore, the total allocations to Turkana County Government in the last four years are KSh39.429 billion. This figure is close to the KSh40 billion claim made by the president. The claim by the Deputy President exceeds this allocation by KSh10 billion.So is there any basis for the KSh33 billion claim by the Governor?The National Treasury reports that the total revenue disbursements to the Turkana County Government from the financial year 2013/2014 to 2015/16 are KSh27,535,608,535. These are inclusive of both the equitable share and conditional grants. The total transfers for the financial year 2013/14, 2014/15 and 2015/16 are KSh7,674,315,857, KSh 9,178,804,658, and KSh10,682,488,020 respectively[JK1] .Through the Kenya Gazette, the Treasury also reports that the actual revenue transfers to the county for the first half of the financial year 2016/2017 (July to December 2016) are KSh 4,805,479,578. This is the latest report on the monthly disbursements to the Counties as published in the Kenya Gazette by the Treasury.Total Financial Disbursements to Turkana County by December 2016The disbursements add up to KS32,341,088,113, which is close to the KSh33 billion claimed by Governor Nanok. On one hand, the President calculated his KSh40 billion based on the total amount allocated to the county in the last three financial years (2013/14 to 2015/16), in addition to the amount for the current financial year 2016/17 that is yet to be disbursed in full. While the president&rsquo;s KSh40 billion is not unreasonable, and because he asked what the governor had done with the money, one can only speak of the money that has already been received.On the other hand, Governor Nanok refers to the total amount disbursed to the county in the first half of the current financial year (July to December 2016) and the amounts disbursed for the other three financial years (2013/14, 2014/15 and 2015/16). The KSh33 billion is the actual amount of money received by (or disbursed to) the county in the last three and a half years (July 2013 to December 2016) and not the four years as claimed by the Governor (with the fourth year ending in June 2017).Therefore, the facts at our disposal show that the Turkana Governor is the only one telling the truth on how much the county government has received as revenue from the national government, which is KSh33 billion.
