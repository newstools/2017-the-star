Anyone who visits health facilities with persistent coughs or other TB symptoms will have to be tested for the disease, the Ministry of Health has said.The decision comes after a survey showed close to 40 per cent of people infected with TB are undiagnosed and therefore continue to spread the bacteria.Most of these are HIV-negative people, whose immunity is stronger.The National TB Prevalence Survey, released last week, found that 82,000 people were diagnosed and treated for TB in 2015, but the actual number of people who contract the disease every year is 138,105.Considering an undiagnosed and untreated individual can infect 10 to 15 people, this pool of missed TB cases continues to fuel the spread of the disease.&ldquo;In light of these results, and in an effort to find the missing TB cases, the government commits to screen all people with respiratory symptoms seeking care at health facilities for TB, carry out targetted screening and active case finding among high risk groups and expand the use of chest X-ray to screen all people presumed to have TB,&rdquo; Dr Izaq Odongo, the head of the department of curative and rehabilitative services at the ministry, said yesterday.Odongo said all presumed TB cases would be subjected to GeneXpert tests.The common diagnosis for TB usually includes taking a chest X-ray and examining a suspected person&rsquo;s sputum under a microscope.But the automated GeneXpert test uses sputum samples and can give multiple results in less than two hours.It can also detect the genetic mutations associated with resistance to the drug Rifampicin.Each machines costs Sh5 million and by the end of this year, Kenya hopes to have more than 300 machines.Last week&rsquo;s survey found 83 per cent of people with TB are HIV negative. This suggests interventions to control TB among people living with HIV have been successful and that a large burden of TB now exists among people not infected with HIV.The prevalence of TB in men was twice as high as that in women with the overall highest burden being among people aged 25 to 34.WHO country representative Dr Rudolf Eggers said the organisation will support Kenya in deriving strategies to end TB based on the study.Tuberculosis is a global health threat.In 2015, before the tuberculosis survey was commissioned, the prevalence of the disease was thought to be 233 cases per every 100,000 Kenyans.
