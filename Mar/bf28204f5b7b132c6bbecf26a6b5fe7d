Baringo Senator Gideon Moi this week was taken to task over a surveillance chopper he promised residents in 2013. "...where is it now that we are [facing] heartless banditry attacks?" resident Samuel Kandagor asked him on Wednesday in Bartabwa. Moi had visited victims displaced by Pokot bandits in Baringo North.
