Wiper will not be party to any joint nomination, secretary general Hassan Omar has said.He said yesterday the fear being propagated by &ldquo;failures&rdquo; that NASA will lose to Jubilee if they filed separate candidate is myopic.He said those spreading fear have failed and want to hide under NASA.&ldquo;Governors feel the burden because of a mistake they have made which created a vacuum for Jubilee to field candidates. Don&rsquo;t call NASA to fix your problems,&rdquo; he said in Mombasa.Omar said in 2013, Cord coalition fielded separate candidates and still defeated Jubilee at the Coast.He cited Mombasa, where ODM and Wiper had candidates for governor.ODM&rsquo;s Hassan Joho beat Suleiman Shahbal, then of Wiper, and Abdalla Mwaruwa, of the now-defunct TNA.But statistics show if Cord could have had a joint candidate in some areas, they would have easily trounced Jubilee, for example the Kamkunji seat in Nairobi.Omar said a joint nomination is similar to party dissolution.&ldquo;Wiper has not ratified any decision to joint nomination,&rdquo; he said.James Orengo, the chairman of the NASA National Coordinating Committee, said they are considering joint nominations and how best it can be done. He said NASA is yet to agree on anything so far, but talks are in progress. But Omar said he will not append his signature to such plans.He said Wiper may go it alone.Orengo said Nairobi and Mombasa are among the areas where NASA is contemplating having a joint candidate. Omar also asked the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission to quickly respond to a letter written on February 20 questioning its level of preparedness for the election.&ldquo;What are the external interfaces connected to the IEBC and the identity of the users and purpose thereof?...Do these include NIS, Jubilee Party, the Immigration Department and other third parties?&rdquo; the letter said.Omar said Kenyans are anxious to know if the electoral agency will hold free, fair and transparent elections in August.
