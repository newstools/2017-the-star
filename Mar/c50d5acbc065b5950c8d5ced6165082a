Former CMC director Joel Kibe has blamed the death of a security guard on the "wrongful erection" of a plastic sentry box on a road in Runda, Nairobi.Kibe lost control of his Range Rover, registration KBQ 959 J, and rammed into a security barrier in the estate on February 2, 2016, killing a guard and injuring another.He was released on Sh300,000 bond after denying charges of causing death by dangerous driving, being under the influence of alcohol and driving carelessly thereby causing injury.More on this: CMC director Joel Kibe denies charges in guard's death, out on Sh300,000 bondKibe defended himself before Milimani senior principal magistrate Benson Nzakyo over the accident that left watchmen Charles Wachira dead and Daniel Omolo injured.He said on Wednesday that it occurred at about 1am as he tried to evade the barrier that had been lifted but "coincidentally dropped" when his car approached.The accident occurred on UN Avenue near Whispers in Gigiri.Kibe said the guards went to the scene a few minutes after he had hit the barrier."Your honour, the guards must have been asleep because I did not see them until I came out of my car. I did not even realise someone had been knocked down. It was the guards who noticed," he said.Kibe further told the court that after the accident, the Nairobi government declared the barrier illegal in a sitting by the county assembly and adopted recommendations for its removal.He added that the Runda Residents Association should be held accountable for the death of the guard for allowing the barrier to be erected at the wrong place.The former director further said he was driving at a speed of between 30kph and 40 kph.The case will be mentioned on April 5, a date by which the defence should have filed written submissions.More on this: Runda guards describe how CMC boss killed officer at barrierAlso see: CMC director kills guard in accident, video shows Kibe was drunk
