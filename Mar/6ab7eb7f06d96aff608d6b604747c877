An activist has sued the Jubilee Party for imposing &lsquo;illegal &lsquo;eligibility requirements on aspirants seeking its tickets. Okiya Omtata says Jubilee, Wiper and Maendeleo Chap Chap violated Article 3 (1) of the Constitution and Elections Act by imposing such a requirement.Under a certificate of urgency, Omtata says the political parties require their hopefuls to be cleared by the KRA, Helb, the DCI, the EACC and the Credit Reference Bureau to qualify for their primaries. He says not all parties have imposed the impugned requirements as they are unconstitutional. Omtata says, &ldquo;When seeking a certificate of good conduct at a Sh1,050 fee, the presumption here is that everybody is a criminal until and unless declared otherwise by the police.&rdquo; He wants the imposition declared unreasonable, illegal and unconstitutional. Omtata also wants an order stopping the state agencies from clearing aspirants.
