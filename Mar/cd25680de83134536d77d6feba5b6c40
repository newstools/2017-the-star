Only Edwin Lavatsa will be unavailable for selection when Bandari FC take on Muhoroni Youth in the SportsPesa Premier League match at the KPA Mbaraki Sports Club on Saturday.The dockers, who settled for a 1-1 draw with Posta Rangers in Thika last weekend, will be happy to welcome back Shaban Kenga and Musa Mudde, who have now been declared fir again after sitting out in the last match. Team manager Alfred Achayo yesterday said the players have been responding well to training and they are hoping for maximum points on Saturday.He said the availability of Kenga and Mudde gives coach Paul Nkata selection options especially in the midfield, where competition has been stiff. &ldquo;We have a very balanced team at the moment and it&rsquo;s just a matter of time before we stamp our Authority in the local league by dominating matches,&rdquo; he said. Achoya said they knew the match against Posta Rangers was going to be tough especially after dominating them last season. &ldquo;We really dominated Posta Rangers last yea. We beat them both ways in the league and also Kecoso games. We therefore expected them to come out very strongly this year,&rdquo; former Bandari and Harambee Stars defender said.He said the technical bench is currently working on a lethal striking partnership between Danny Sserenkuma, Enock Agwanda and Keli who were acquired from Gor Mahia.Achayo said they will approach the Muhoroni Youth game very cautiously considering that they are a very stubborn outfit.&ldquo;Muhoroni Youth have always been very hard nuts to crack especially whenever we play them in Mombasa. We are taking the match very seriously especially after they lost their opening match 1-3 to Sofapaka,&rdquo; he said.
