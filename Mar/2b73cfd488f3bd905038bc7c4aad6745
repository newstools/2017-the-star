Devolution CS Mwangi Kiunjuri on Monday thrilled and entertained mourners at Governor Nderitu Gachagua&rsquo;s funeral when he used Kikuyu proverbs and sayings to drive his point home.The youthful CS, who used the proverbs and narratives in his speech, kept his 30-minute speech live and mourners forgot their grief and laughed.Proverbs are commonly used by the elderly people to make a strong point.His way with words has made him a crowd-puller, as many people like listening to his speeches.On Monday at Gachagua&rsquo;s home in Hiriga, Nyeri county, Kiunjuri told one proverb after another. &ldquo;President Uhuru Kenyatta stick to power like the tail of a lizard. The grandmother of the frogs will vow how she will count the tails of the frogs, although no frog has a tail,&rdquo; Kiunjuri said.Kiunjuri also used parables, saying, &ldquo;When two bananas are being roasted, one being for a neighbour&rsquo;s child and the other for the family&rsquo;s child, the one for the neighbour&rsquo;s child is placed on top of the fire, but that of the child from the family, is roasted under hot ash.&rdquo;The CS was advising Nyeri residents to prioritise Jubilee and ensure the party remains strong.Kiunjuri also told residents, &ldquo;There is a time for jokes and a time to swallow the bone. Locusts are normally hunted in the morning.&rdquo;Narrating how he lost the Laikipia governor&rsquo;s seat, he said although he was running using the GNU ticket, he was sure he would win.Kiunjuri said it was not until the last few days to the 2013 general election when Uhuru and Deputy President William Ruto landed in TNA party branded choppers and convinced residents to elect TNA candidate Joshua Irungu, that his fortunes changed for the worst.He said the wave of GNU immediately changed. The President and his deputy promised residents that if he [Kiunjuri] lost, he would be given a job in the Jubilee administration. &ldquo;I lost the seat and went home,&rdquo; he said.When Ruto rose to speak, he said, &ldquo;Months later, I remembered that I promised Laikipia residents about the issue and told the President about the issue. I told him if I did not work on it, I would appear to have lied,&rdquo; Ruto said.The DP said that is how Kiunjuri landed his Devolution CS job.Kiunjuri also moved mourners when he said former President Mwai Kibaki paid his fees when he was at the University of Nairobi.There was laughter when he said that, &ldquo;there was still fees balance for the final year.&rdquo;
