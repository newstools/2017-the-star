ANC is a party whose ethos fit with my aspirations," he said."I will join hands with the national and local ANC leaders to strengthen the party."While welcoming Makali at the ANC party offices in Nairobi, Bungoma branch secretary Martin Waliaula lauded the move and promised to lobby grassroots support for his senator bid."Makali is a big catch for ANC in Bungoma. He is a candidate we have been eyeing for a very long time," Waliaula said."We will tap into his expertise and experience to grow and expand ANC's influence in the county and beyond."
