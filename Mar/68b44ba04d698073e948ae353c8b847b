Parliamentary Select Committee on Security chairman Asman Kamama is increasing under pressure to resign to pave way for investigations into clashes in Baringo.Human rights activist Amos Olempaka yesterday said Kamama will interfere with the investigations, amid allegations he may be involved in instigating the clashes in the county. The violence has claimed more than 10 lives and displaced 10,000 people in Baringo North and South.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s ironical Kamama chairs such a sensitive committee, when people in his home area are being killed. He should do the honourable thing and resign,&rdquo; Olempaka said in Eldoret.This comes after Kamama on Monday refused to resign and distanced himself from the violence.&ldquo;I cannot quit because of false claims by my opponents. I am ready to support this probe and to investigated because I know I have not done anything wrong,&rdquo; Kamama said.The Tiaty MP on said he does not support banditry and said his committee plays an oversight role and only advances the decisions of the government not individuals.&ldquo;I am not using my position in Parliament to support banditry. I have nothing to gain from having people killed. We should deal with criminals involved not side shows,&rdquo; Kamama said.He also urged the Kenya Red Cross to resume operations in Baringo.
