Kipchumba Murkomen wants election laws requiring elected leaders to meet academic qualifications scrapped.The Elgeyo Marakwet Senator said the electorate has a right to elect people with leadership qualifications without looking at academic requirements.Murkomen, the deputy majority leader in the Senate, noted the law has forced governor aspirants to acquire degrees through questionable means.The Senator added that legal requirements for elective offices are forcing many people running for offices to commit crimes including forging academic documents, just to get the chance to fulfill their leadership dreams.He sympathised with Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho who went to DCI on Wednesday to record a statement over claims that he forged his KCSE certificate to get into the UoN.Joho said he was proud of the D- he got in KCSE and noted that failure caused him to work harder for success.&ldquo;I totally agree that academic success is not the only measure for success in life. I know in Kenya a person who scores a D- cannot even qualify to serve in any sector of our armed forces,&rdquo; Murkomen said in a Facebook post on Wednesday.&ldquo;I have argued before that those who want to be elected should have qualifications determined by voters. My argument is that the voter is wiser and knows what he wants."More on this: I am proud of my D- in KCSE, was not as privileged as Uhuru -JohoAlso see: [VIDEO] 'Fire for fire': Politicians, youths cause frenzy, march to DCI with JohoMurkomen argued in January 5, 2017 during debate on Election Laws (Amendment) Act, 2016 in the Senate, that the law which will be implemented in 2022 should be scrapped in its entirety.Governor and President aspirants are required to be degree holders to qualify to run for office.&ldquo;Who are we to come here and legislate that a person is not qualified to run for office? Let citizens sit down and decide the person they wish to elect,&rdquo; he said during the debate.He decried the acquisition of numerous fake degrees by politicians seeking to meet academic qualifications, saying some leaders have PhDs but do not exhibit matching competencies.&ldquo;Some people have degrees but can&rsquo;t even construct a sentence,&rdquo; he said.Education CS Fred Matiang'i said last November that universities issuing degrees to undeserving politicians in order for them to vie for elective positions risk having their charters revoked,Matiang&rsquo;i said the Commission for University Education would undertake an enrollment audit of all students in Kenyan universities.He said the commercialisation of University education had created the risk of admission of students had no initial qualifications to undertake undergraduate education.More on this: Universities giving unqualified politicians degrees will lose their charters &ndash; Matiang&rsquo;iAlso read: Top politicians with 'questionable' academic papers
