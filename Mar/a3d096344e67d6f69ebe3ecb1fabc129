Former Mungiki boss Maina Njenga has sued President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s Jubilee Party for refusing to accept his nomination papers.Njenga, who wants to vie for Laikipia senator, yesterday said the decision to lock him out is unfair.According to the suit papers, Njenga alleges he spent more than Sh100 million campaigning for Jubilee. He said his rights are not privileges granted by the party leaders and cannot be taken away by individuals.Njenga has also sought an order by the Political Parties Disputes Tribunal compelling Jubilee and the IEBC to be democratic and fair.He said he has not been given a reason why his nomination papers were rejected.Njenga said he paid the Sh50,000 nomination fees and complied with the requirements to get a certificate of good conduct and compliance documents from the Kenya Revenue Authority, Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission and the Credit Reference Bureau.Through lawyer Evans Ondieki, Njenga said he is a registered member of JP. &ldquo;It is unfair for the respondents to reject my nomination papers without giving reasons&rdquo; he said. Njenga said his application was rejected following instructions from President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto.He accused the leaders of being dictatorial. Njenga denied ever being a member of the Mungiki sect.&ldquo;I do not appreciate the animal called Mungiki. I am a God-fearing person,&rdquo; he said.He told the state to produce evidence he was ever a member of the outlawed sect.There have been mixed reactions to JP&rsquo;s rejection of Njenga. His supporters said the decision was unfair, while critics said it shows JP is a party of integrity.
