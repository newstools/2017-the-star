Elders from Garissa Governor Nathif Jama's Aulihan sub-clan clashed at a press conference on Monday over whom they will support for the county top seat.An elder told the Star during the four-hour meeting at a Garissa town hotel, they agreed they would not name their preferred candidates.However, things went south when some elders said they had withdrawn their support for Jama for what they termed as failure to deliver on his mandate as the governor. In attendance were former Livestock and Agriculture executive Hajir Dahiye, Jama's former political adviser Abdikadir Shakur, Ibrahim Ali and Siyad Nur.Ali and Nur enumerated the reasons why they will campaign against Jama.&ldquo;During the 2014 floods in Lagdera, the governor did not set foot in the area to assist residents. Our hospitals have been closed for lack of medicine. Drought is wiping out our livestock and nothing substantial has been done by the governor or his administration. That is why we are withdrawing our support,&rdquo; Nur said.Shakur said the elders' position is that they have had not settled on whether to withdraw their support for Jama or not.&ldquo;We have not agreed to withdraw support for anybody. This was not discussed,&rdquo; he said before storming out of the venue.The other elders left in huff, leaving journalists confused.The elders said they will continue consulting and come up with their preferred candidates for various seats.Jama, who won on the Wiper ticket in 2013, will face stiff competition from long-term administrator Ali Korane of the Jubilee Party.He was Jama's strongest rival in 2013.
