Nairobi&rsquo;s debt has shot up by Sh3 billion in one year to Sh48 billion.A report by the county assembly Finance and Budget Committee showed public debt has increased by Sh16 billion from 2013.The report was tabled by committee chairman Michael Ogada on Wednesday. &ldquo;The committee notes the county public debt would grow to unsustainable levels if nothing is done to reverse the alarming trends,&rdquo; it reads.Ogada attributed the debt to penalties and interest charged on outstanding debt by statutory bodies, to which most of the debt is owed. The report was based on the fiscal strategy paper and debt management.According to the 2017-18 strategy paper, City Hall owed the Local Authorities Pension Trust Sh10.5 billion at June last year. It owes Kenya Revenue Authority more than Sh2.5 billion.Last December Finance executive Gregory Mwakanongo hinted the county could transfer prime property to Laptrust to offset the debt.In February 2013, a month before the city council was dissolved, it signed off on a Sh2 billion estate to Lapfund in a property swap to offset a debt. The council lost at least Sh500 million in the deal.
