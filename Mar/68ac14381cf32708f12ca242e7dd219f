Two Principals Secretaries who have been accused of insubordination were among 12 that President Uhuru Kenyatta shuffled yesterday.Patrick Nduati (Irrigation) and Nicholas Muraguri (Health) have over the last couple of weeks been accused of insubordination by their respective Cabinet Secretaries.State House said the President had "purposed the changes to enhance teamwork".The other reason stated was Uhuru's plan to improve the accountability for results in the execution of responsibilities.The State House statement said, "In the continuing endeavour by Jubilee to improve services, Uhuru has deemed it necessary to make changes to the organisation of government."Nduati was moved from the State Department of Irrigation and will now be at the Industry and Enterprise Development, in the same capacity.The PS has been in the news for the last couple of weeks over a controversy that has hit the tender for civil works at the Sh62 billion Thwake Dam. Differences between Nduati and CS Eugene Wamalwa over the matter played out before the Agriculture Committee of the National Assembly.Wamalwa said he had warned the PS over the tendering. The MPs said the PS would pay if Kenyans paid more for the project.The PS defied the advice of Wamalwa, Attorney General Githu Muigai, MPs and the African Development Bank and awarded the tender to the second-lowest bidder last week.AfDB wrote to the government this week, saying it may have to divert the funds to other projects if the tender goes to the second-lowest bidder.Nduati wants Sinohydro, which is blacklisted by the World Bank, to get the tender, despite having bid Sh3 billion more than a fellow Chinese firm, Ghezouba.Muraguri was moved from the Health ministry and will now be based at Ardhi House, as the new Lands Principal Secretary.Last year, Muraguri was reprimanded for having threatened a journalist writing an alleged Sh3 billion scandal at the ministry.The PS was forced to publicly apologise for his comments to the journalist, saying the incident was regrettable and embarrassing for the government.Controversy faced Muraguri again this year when he was accused of frustrating the talks between the government and doctors that led to 100 days of strike.Again, the PS was made to apologise publicly to his Cabinet Secretary Cleopa Mailu for "undermining" his authority.The CS instructed the PS to attend the talks with the doctors, but Muraguri never attended the meetings.Richard Ekai, who was at the Department of Sports Development, has been moved to Correctional Services.In January, Direction of Public Prosecution Keriako Tobiko recommended that Ekai and Sports Cabinet Secretary Hassan Wario be charged with abuse of office during the 2016 Rio Olympics.Tobiko said the ministry incurred an extra cost of Sh6.6 million for having to cater for six extra people in the delegation to Rio.Another Sh59.153 million was lost on irregular payments on tickets irregularly procured by Ekai and the ministry's director of administration, Haron Komen.Others moved include Micah Pkopus Powon from the correctional centres, to the Devolution ministry, and Peter Kaberia, from Defence, to Sports and Development.Mwanamaka Mabruki (Devolution) was moved to Gender Affairs, Mariam El Maawy from Lands to Public Works and Julius Koris from Industry to Health.Saitoti Torome, who was in Planning, has been moved to Defence, Wilson Nyakera, from Transport to Planning, and Paul Mwangi from Public Works to Transport.
