They normally collect the money from sympathisers, he told the Star in a phone interview on Sunday.The police boss added that the suspect arrested in Majengo may be one of al Shabaab's key financiers. We are still holding the suspects. Investigations are in top gear to establish their links with terror activities," he said.But the family denied the claims that they were linked to al Shabaab and said police harassed them during the raid.Swaleh, who has three grandchildren, said on Saturday that the agents shot in the air upon arrival and demanded to know who she was and who she was staying with. I was beaten when I tried standing up after hearing someone crying upstairs, she said, adding the officers harassed her and did not let her speak.She was later taken to hospital.Fatma Swaleh said they were afraid because they were "subjected to torture" and that the children witnessed the whole operation.
