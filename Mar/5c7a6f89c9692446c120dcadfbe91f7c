NASA has unveiled an elaborate nominations plan mapping the country into four broad zones to eliminate friction and fraction among affiliates and win majority of seats.As for integrity issues, it leaves ethics clearance up to individual parties. This is in contrast with reports the Jubilee coalition that wants to bar from election politicians who are in court for alleged corruption, forgery, rape, assault and other offences.The opposition deposited its nomination rules last week with the IEBC and the Registrar of Political Parties.This comes as affiliate parties ODM and Wiper clash over joint nominations &mdash; some Wiper leaders don't want the &mdash; in a dispute threatening NASA unity even before the presidential candidate is unveiled.Wiper secretary general Hassan Omar and ODM director of elections Junet Mohamed are at odds, despite accord on a document quietly finalised last Thursday.According to rules obtained exclusively by the Star, the NASA National Coordinating Committee has divided the country into four regions guiding the complex nominations process.This is intended to ease or eliminate tension and fractions marring many primaries.Rules list five methods of nomination: consensus, electoral college, primary, open contest and direct nomination.Nairobi University professor Adams Oloo, heading the ODM campaign secretariat, yesterday said NASA had to craft nominations rules "distinct and tailor-made" for specific scenarios. &ldquo;This is a coalition. There are negotiations and middle grounds. There are areas where they can't agree on everything, that is why they have four models that are peculiar and distinct,&rdquo; he told the Star. &ldquo;In young democracies like ours, some people have personal interests as opposed to interests of parties. The four models will minimise frictions and fractures characterising nominations," he said.The first scenario involves NASA strongholds only where one of four affiliates &mdash; ODM, Wiper, ANC and Ford Kenya &mdash; is dominant.These could be Nyanza or Lower Eastern where ODM and Wiper, respectively, command enormous followings. They would hold their own primaries.The second scenario involves opposition strongholds where two or more of the four constituents command popularity. An example is Western where Raila Odinga's ODM, Musalia Mudavadi's ANC and Moses Wetangu'la's Ford Kenya all are strong. In cases where Jubilee has no chance, each party would hold primaries and their candidates would face off on August 8.According to the document, the third scenario is for battlegrounds, but where only one NASA party is dominant.Here, only the dominant party will conduct nominations and the successful candidate will face JP.Then, there are battleground regions in which two or more affiliates are popular. An example could be Nairobi and Northeastern.In this scenario, NASA parties will conduct joint primaries and the eventual winner will be the opposition flagbearer.However, conspicuously missing from the document are the names of areas zoned by the 12-member NCC.Kakamega Senator Bonny Khalwale, an NCC member, said the decision will be made by that committee consulting NASA chiefs.Already, sharp differences have rocked NASA over joint nominations.Omar, a key ally of ex-Vice President Kalonzo Musyoka, announced his Wiper Party would oppose joint nominations, calling them equivalent to party dissolution.Khalwale dismissed Omar's concerns.&ldquo;The people complaining are talking out of ignorance. We have not decided which regions are strongholds, which ones are not. So people like Omar are jumping the gun,&rdquo; Khalwale told the Star.Khalwale added, &ldquo;The NCC where all affiliate parties are represented had 100 per cent concurrence on how this should be done ... NASA is a good idea. We cannot cannibalise ourselves.&rdquo;But nomination rules state NASA parties shall be responsible for procuring the consent of aspirants to participate in NASA joint nominations.Aspirants will be required to sign an official form, giving express consent for joint primaries.This is intended to avoid grumbling leading to fallout and benefitting Jubilee.In an NCC effort to achieve affiliate balance, the document details six criteria to determine party strength.These include presence in a region, for example, through party structures, number of registered members and number of aspirants for its ticket.Other consideration are what NASA terms &ldquo;objective evidence of popularity&rdquo;, such as opinion polls.But in what may give ODM an edge, the document says performance in past elections will also be weighed. This includes number of seats won and votes cast.ODM made a clean sweep in Western, Kisii, Nairobi and Coast where its alliance partners now demand a share.As for methods of nomination, where consensus is chosen, the County Coordinating Committee, an NCC organ, will convene a meeting of all aspirants for each seat to select a candidate amongst themselves."Where consensus by electoral pact is not achieved, the CCC in consultation with NCC and aspirants for particular seats will decide on either electoral college, primary, or open contest," the rules state.Machakos Senator Johnson Muthama said the method would apply where clans are influential.Under electoral college, at least 100 delegates shall vote and the winner will be the one securing50 plus one. Each party picks anequal number of delegates.If no candidate wins, the two top candidates will have a run-off.In a primary, NASA will prepare a consolidated membership register for each electoral area for joint nominations.NASA will hold an open contest where affiliates will be allowed to face each other.
