The problems facing the devolved health sector could soon get a lasting solution after two parliamentary committee bosses backed a petition to set up a commission to address heath workers issues and revert the sector to the state.Health committee chairman Wilfred Machage (Senate) and vice chairman Robert Pukose (National Assembly) yesterday said the petition by a consumer lobby group asking MPs to initiate an amendment to the Constitution to help resolve challenges facing the sector and striking doctors is &ldquo;timely.&rdquo;Pukose said , &ldquo;The spirit of the Constitution did not contemplate on the transfer of functions as it is now. For instance, Schedule Four devolving health does not define county health facilities. The petition seeks to rectify the wrongs done during that time of devolving the sector.&rdquo; Machage said , &ldquo;That is the way to go and I support so long as changes are made to the Constitution. We have to go as per the constitution because the national government has a big crack to put a wedge.&rdquo;The Medical Services Consumers Association chaired by Eric Orina says that implementing their prayers, allows the country to have a universal policy to manage healthcare and doctors&rsquo; union have an undisputed CBA with the Health ministry. Health workers union representatives had alleged the government was opposed to their push to have a commission, similar to the Teachers Service Commission to handle their affairs.
