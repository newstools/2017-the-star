Residents in Ukasi location of Mwingi Central constituency want security beefed up. This is after four residents - brothers Matei Mauta and Kyalo Mauta, Mutambuki Katuo and Muthami Mulonzya - were last week killed during an attack by Somali bandits. Yesterday, the residents said they have had to flee their homes. Last week, Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery issued guns to 80 police reservists.Resident Kilonzi Muange said Mwanzele trade centre, which has forcibly been taken from Kambas by Somalis, should be demolished.He said, &ldquo;The government may have deployed police reservists, but we are calling upon it to compensate the families of the 31 people killed this year. We are tired of living like strangers in our motherland.&rdquo; Muange said the bandits forcibly graze on their land and residents who resist them are killed. On Saturday Kitui Governor Julius Malombe urged the county survey director to set up beacons and establish the border between Kitui and Tana River counties. He also urged the national government to move the Ukasi police post to Katumba, closer to the shopping centre.
