The banking industry regulator expects growth in loans to the private sector to start edging up next month. April is the deadline for commercial banks to present their revised business models for sustainable growth.Central Bank of Kenya governor Patrick Njoroge said yesterday he expect year-on-year growth in credit uptake by the private sector to be at about 5.5 per cent from next month, rising to about 10 per cent by year-end.Growth in private sector credit has stabilised at about 4.5 per cent since December 2016 after a steady slowdown from about 17 per cent in December 2015, largely on rising default levels.The banks will have to satisfy the regulator that their revised business models will withstand increased competition amid tight regulations.&ldquo;All banks are supposed to get back to us by end of April with their revised business plans .There is a lot of dynamism. They (banks) cannot remain in business as usual (mode), they should look at what their comparative advantage is and what their niche is,&rdquo; Njoroge told a press conference in Nairobi. &ldquo;They need to have much more sustainable models that they does not involve charging everybody an arm and a leg.&rdquo;The CBK's Monetary Policy Committee on Monday said that while the growth in private sector credit has stabilised at 4.5 per cent, the share of loans to corporates has increased relative to business and personal loans.However, loan approvals declined by six per cent between December 2016 and February 2017. Private sector credit growth fell to 4.3 per cent in December 2016 compared to more than 17 per cent a year earlier, Central Bank of Kenya data show.&ldquo;Lending to micro, small, and medium enterprises has declined in value terms as reflected in reduced lending by large and medium banks,&rdquo; the MPC saidNjoroge said the reduction is unlikely to affect the general economic growth.The regulator, however, hinted at a possible reversal of the interest cap law to allow more SMEs access credit. Njoroge said CBK will be conducting a survey to determine the impact of the amended law on credit markets.&ldquo;I am a firm believer that we will get back where we used to be. I believe that the data will show it is quite damaging to the economy and to our own people: The people that we expected to help are the ones that are hurt the most,&rdquo; Njoroge said.Treasury CS Henry Rotich on Monday said the government is &ldquo;keenly monitoring&rdquo; the impact of the law to ensure it does not hurt growth in the economy.President Uhuru Kenyatta, who signed into the law the bill in August 2016, has also expressed concern over the credit squeeze to SMEs The Kenya Bankers Association, the industry lobby, last week warned that credit to households, manufacturing, trade and building and construction is likely to fall below four per cent, as lenders continue to prefer risk-free government securities and assets with higher returns.
