The government has announced plans to construct 40 dams to make water accessible.Only 60 per cent of Kenyans have access to clean water, the ministry said.Water CS Eugene Wamalwa said the dams, whose construction in some areas has started, will bring water closer to the people.Wamalwa said the ministry is keen to ensure access to water hits 80 per cent in three years, in line with Vision 2030.&ldquo;The national government is developing the necessary infrastructure to make sure we increase access to water for all by 2020 in the short term, and in 10 years,&rdquo; he said.The CS said the department is working with private-public partners to fast-track the projects.In Nyandarua, the CS said the three dams under construction would provide water to Gilgil and Naivasha residents.&ldquo;It is the duty of Nakuru and Nyandarua governors to work together to see the full realisation of these projects,&rdquo; Wamalwa said.Naivasha has had poor quality water which has discoloured residents&rsquo; teeth. The CS said the new dams will end this problem.He said 23 arid and semi-arid areas are facing severe drought and the solution is to develop water-harvesting and storage mechanisms.
