The owner of Nice &amp; Lovely Paul Muchene Kinuthia fired in the air causing panic at a popular club situated off Kiambu Road, two bouncers on Friday told a Nairobi court.The court heard that Kinuthia fired three live bullets after Eric Wambua and Paul Obwayo denied him entry into Sharks Palace on January 14."The accused arrived at the club at around 11pm and we conducted a search on him and discovered he had a firearm and upon requesting him to produce his firearm licence he did not have one to allow him entry," Obwayo said.However, the two denied having been threatened during the incident.Kinuthia has pleaded not guilty to two charges of going armed into a public place and creating a disturbance in a manner likely to cause a breach of peace.Manager Ongoli Kwang'a told the court that he was in his office at 11pm when he heard three gunshots outside the club premises.He rushed to the restaurant and found some customers lying on the floor and others running out of the club for safety.Kwanga said Kinuthia, who was with his wife, was disarmed, arrested and taken to Muthaiga police station.Earlier reports indicated that Kinuthia fought with his wife in their car outside the club. His wife then got out of the car and ran into the club with Kinuthia running after her. It was claimed he shot in the air as he looked for her.The hearing continues on March 29, when four officers and a ballistic expert will testify.
