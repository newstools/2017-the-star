Opinion polls in Kenya are fake and engineered by corrupt organisations to please their corrupt bosses in NASA and Jubilee to shape the opinion of Kenyans, Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka said yesterday.Some Jubilee and NASA leaders fund these polls to undermine the popularity of some leaders, he said. Your pollsters, and I am mentioning you Ipsos, Synovate, Infotrack, stop misleading Kenyans. Kenyans are tired of being led by your cooked figures," Kalonzo said.He spoke in Gongoni, Magarini, during a rally during his second tour of Kilifi county to make his party popular.Kalonzo said he will deal with the organisations to ensure justice.The Wiper party leader said he was shocked to hear that NASA co-principal Moses Wetang'ula was placed at three per cent, while he stands at 10 per cent in a popularity poll.He urged polling companies to sample a minimum of 100,000 Kenyans in their polls to reflect the opinion of the people.He rejected polls done on a few people and said some of them are paid to give the opinion wanted by their financiers. We are going to deal with you mundu khu mundu (man to man) each time Kalonzo is given 10 per cent. I have been Vice President. I will not allow you to destroy Kenya. I will deal with you," Kalonzo said said.Once the truth unfolds, people will threaten to reveal the names of the poll financiers, he said.The Wiper leader said UK opinion polls done did not work and recently in the US elections, they did not reflect the outcome.He was with Kwale governor hopeful Chirau Ali Mwakwere, Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana, Kisii Governor hopeful Lumumba Nyaber and other Wiper leaders.In Magarini, journalist Johnson Nzai is among those who defected from ODM to Wiper.He will run for Gongoni ward, while Knut's Fred Nguma will contest for Magarini MP on the wiper ticket.Earlier, Kalonzo was at JCC Malindi for Sunday prayers in a summon led by Bishop Thomas Kakala. Kalonzo urged Kenyans to pray for the country to prevent rigging in the election.NASA is expected to soon announce its flagbearer who will challenge the Jubilee Party s President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto.An opinion poll by Infotrack shows that Jubilee is the favourite among Kenyans (40 per cent) and is followed by the newly formed NASA at 32 per cent.Twenty eight per cent of those who were interviewed in the research said they were undecided.On political parties, JP led at 34 per cent, while Raila Odinga's ODM was ranked a distant second.Wiper followed at 3.4 per cent and then came Moses Wetang'ula's Ford Kenya (one per cent), Isaac Rutto's Chama Cha Mashinani (0.8 per cent), ANC (0.5 per cent), Maendeleo Chap Chap (0.4 per cent) and Kanu (0.3 per cent).The poll was conducted from February 2 to 24 and involved 1,500 participants from counties in Nairobi, Coast, Nyanza, Western, Northeastern, Central, Eastern and Rift Valley.
