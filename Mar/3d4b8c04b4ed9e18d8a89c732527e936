Devolution CS Mwangi Kiunjuri yesterday urged counties to embrace the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability assessment by the Kenya Institute of Public Policy Research and Analysis.The PEFA assessment of counties in the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability was launched in Nairobi.Six counties &mdash; Kajiado, Baringo, Makueni, West Pokot, Nakuru and Kakamega &mdash; volunteered to take part inthe first batch of PEFA assessment.Kiunjuri said all counties should take up the scrutiny to strengthen public finance management.The assessment will use budget reliability, transparency of government finance, management of assets and liabilities, policy-based fiscal strategy and budgeting, to determine each county&rsquo;s prudence in expenditure of resources.Other mechanisms to be used include predictability and control in budget execution, accounting and reporting, external scrutiny and audit.Kiunjuri said a similar exercise targeting the national government has recently been concluded.The exercise measures the counties aggregate fiscal discipline, strategic resource allocation, efficient use of resources for service delivery and crucial for reforms to be undertaken in public finance management to ensure maximum delivery of services.&ldquo;With a limited pot of resources, efficient use of what is available becomes critical in the delivery of required services.It has been a learning process to ensure institutional structures are put in place to facilitate efficient and effective public finance management,&rdquo;Kiunjuri said in statement read by PS Torome Saitoti. &ldquo;I am aware that counties have put efforts to strengthen their public finance management system and the National Treasury has been instrumental in building capacity at the county level on public finance management. These efforts are bearing fruits.&rdquo;The CS said the devolved system of government is aimed at taking development and services closer to the people.
