The Council of Governors yesterday dismissed fresh efforts to revert health services to the national government.CoG Health committee chairman Jack Ranguma said the motion in the National Assembly by Bureti MP Leonard Sang&rsquo; is misplaced.Sang&rsquo;, in a private members motion, wants a constitutional amendment to revert health services to the national government.Doctors had been on strike for 100 days, which ended on March 14. &ldquo;That motion is aimed at reversing the gains we have made in health services. We have made a lot of strides, and any effort to revert health services to the national government will be resisted,&rdquo; said Ranguma, who is also the Kisumu governor.He spoke to journalists at Kisii University during the opening day of the Lake Region Health Investment Conference. Ranguma was with Kisii Deputy Governor Joash Maangi.&ldquo;Health is one of the best performing dockets of all devolved services. That was the narrative during the 4th devolution conference in Naivasha. Cases of infant and maternal mortality have gone down according to the latest indicators,&rdquo; Ranguma said.The services can only be reverted to the national government through consent from governors or a referendum. Counties have improved health infrastructure besides investing in modern diagnostic equipment, Ranguma said. &ldquo;County hospitals now offer specialised services which were only available in Nairobi,&rdquo; Ranguma said.&ldquo;We cannot go back. It&rsquo;s impossible.&rdquo; Maangi, the chairman of the Deputy Governors Forum, said the move by the MP is misplaced. He read mischief in the MP&rsquo;s bid to have health services revert to the national government. KMPDU national chairman Samuel Oroko said their primary interest is to have a central agency manage the human resource in the health department.&ldquo;If we have the agency in place, issues of tribalism and nepotism will come to an end in the counties,&rdquo; he said.
