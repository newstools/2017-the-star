Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho has "taken pride" in his D- in the 1993 KCSE examination saying failure pushed him to succeed.Joho has been accused of forging the certificate for the secondary school national exam to get admission to the University of Nairobi.The claim is that he presented a forged 1992 examination result slip with a C+ mean grade for a Bachelor of Commerce degree in Human Resource Management.But the Governor, who has denied the claim, told a press briefing in Mombasa on Tuesday that failing KCSE cannot keep one from succeeding."Why would I want to forge my own certificate... I am holder of a D- but I have changed that to progress. I will progress and you will not stop me," he said. "If you do not do well there are many ways to further your education."Read: I did not forge KCSE certificate, Joho saysAn emotive Joho said failure in KCSE pushes one to work even harder.He said he and President Uhuru Kenyatta differ in the way they were raised and that the latter's education may have been easier than other people's."Kuna tofauti kubwa kimaisha ikiwa utalelewa kwa familia ya kitajiri na familia isiyo ya kitajiri (There is a very big difference between growing up rich and poor)," he said."When he went to kindergarten his father might have issued one cheque to pay his fees up to PhD level. Some of us have had to struggle to get to where we are."The county chief, who has engaged in confrontations with Uhuru, said he worked while studying to pay his school fees."Ilibidi nikitoka shule niingie katika shughuli lingine (I had to engage in other activities after school)," he said, adding he supported his family by selling snacks on the streets.He added that he also worked at the port where he was paid Sh80 to carry cargo."Ni watu wachache sana ambao wanaweza kujilipia karo (very few people can pay their own school fees)... I have paid my own fees and for my brothers," he said.Noting his desire was to inspire others, the Governor said he still has a long way to go."Jubilee wamekuwa kwa comfort zone from the day I was born (Jubilee has been in a comfort zone since I was born," he said.Joho said he will not be intimidated by anyone or by investigations."Nasikia hata wameanza investigations into my birth certificate. Wacha watafute hata ya marriage (I am told they are also looking into my birth certificate. Let them also find the one for marriage)."But the ODM deputy leader asked how a confidential document could reach the hands of people in social media. Politics in Kenya is unbecoming, he said.A letter from Knec purported that the county boss' KCSE papers were forged.Acting chief executive Mercy Karogo said in a letter to the DCI Ndegwa Muhoro, said they proved that the documents presented to the council were fake."Since when have you seen such a document from Knec marked confidential? How did it make its way to the public?" he asked.Joho pointed the finger at Jubilee but said the propaganda will not stop him from achieving his goals. He said he and others in the Opposition will continue pushing their agenda."We will continue putting them on check," he said, adding leaders in the ruling coalition may not want this.The governor said institutions in the country are to serve Kenyans, not side with Uhuru's government."Institutions in this country are supposed to serve us because we pay them. We are the taxpayers...we are watching you...you will individually be held to account one day," he said.On Monday, Serani Secondary School defended Joho over claims that he forged his KCSE result slip.In a press statement, principal Abbas Juma Ulaya said the Governor was a bonafide student at the school.He said Joho was at the school from February 1990 and left in November 1993, having successfully sat his KCSE exams."Joho enrolled at the institution on 22/02/1990 under admission number 326," Ulaya said.More on this: Joho was our bonafide student, Serani principal saysAlso read: DCI summons Joho to record statement over forged exam slip claims
