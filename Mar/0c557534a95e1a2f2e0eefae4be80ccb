Televangelist Gilbert Deya is at the centre of fresh investigations after a court in Nairobi disowned an order purporting to quash his prosecution for child trafficking.Justice Roselyne Aburili yesterday directed investigations into the matter after she was informed that Deya has furnished a UK court with a fake order. The order, the court heard, purports that all cases against him before the Kenyan courts have been terminated.Prosecutor Edwin Okello told Aburili that the UK has since been notified the order is not genuine.Yesterday, it also turned out that the case file has gone missing, prompting the judge to order reconstruction of a skeleton file.&ldquo;The DPP should carry out investigations as appropriate and the two deputy registrars of the division should find out where the order originated from,&rdquo; the judge said.The judge said the preacher&rsquo;s lawyer should also explain where the order came from and how it ended up in the court in the UK.&ldquo;We are discouraging this kind of monkey business...&rdquo; Aburili said.Deya, whose warrant of arrest was issued on September 12, 2005, lives in the UK, where he runs the Gilbert Deya Ministries, which is said to have more than 36,000 followers and is linked to the &ldquo;miracle babies&rdquo; infamy.Extradition proceedings against him are in the City of Westminster magistrate&rsquo;s court.On December 18, 2007, the foreign court ordered that he be extradited to Kenya, but he appealed.&ldquo;The appeal was heard by the High Court of Justice Queen&rsquo;s Bench Divisional Court and was dismissed on October 31, 2008,&rdquo; a court document, lodged in the proceedings in Nairobi, reads. Before Aburili, he is seeking to quash the decision by the Inspector General of Police to prosecute him with child trafficking on grounds that his wife was acquitted of similar charges.
