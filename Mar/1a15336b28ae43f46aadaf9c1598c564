Fans of AFC Leopards and Ulinzi Stars will have to wait a little bit longer to see their clubs in domestic action after the Kenyan Premier League failed to announce the date for their opening clash in the SportPesa Premier League.KPL&rsquo;s league and competitions administrator, Michael Kirwa said they are yet to agree on the date for the clash. &ldquo;We are yet to get a confirmation on when the match will be played,&rdquo; Kirwa responded tersely. The match was expected to be played today after the soldiers returned to the country over the weekend following their 4-0 mauling at the hands of Egyptian side, Smouha in the first round, first leg clash of the CAF Cup. The league clash pitting the two sides had been slated for Machakos.Also yet to get league action are Kakamega Homeboyz and Western Stima, who continue to wait for their opponents depending on the decision by the Sports Disputes Tribunal. Sofapaka, Muhoroni Youth, KCB or Vihiga United are waiting to get the STD green-light on which two teams will feature in the expanded 18-team Premier League.Meanwhile, after seeing his side come from a goal down to edge Thika United 3-2 in a pulsating encounter last Sunday, Mathare United coach Francis Kimanzi has exuded confidence in his squad despite the departure of several key players among them Eric Johanna and Robinson Kamura and Whyvvone Isuza, both of whom joined AFC Leopards.Kimanzi had in place a new loom midfield but it was the eye-catching performance of David Owino capped that ensured they bagged maximum points.&ldquo;When we finished the recruitment process, I kept thinking that ours is a squad of very young players out to learn the ropes on the rigours of this league but they have shown maturity and I can see a lot of potential in them. Our defensive organisation was not up to scratch and I can&rsquo;t blame the goalkeeper only. We have to do more in the next match but I believe the players will improve as time goes by. This is a team with huge potential,&rdquo; Kimanzi said in his post match comments.
