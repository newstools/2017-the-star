The idea of leadership inheritance does not apply here," he said.The aspirant added that Kenyans should be allowed to exercise their democratic right of electing their leader."Locals have the right to elect whoever they want. It is not upon a family to bring us a person and say he is the one who will lead us," he said.Bulushi said he was ready for a joint nomination with other candidates from other parties under the National Super Alliance and would respect the outcome of the exercise."We will follow laws governing parties under NASA," he said.The don, who was accompanied by Lungalunga MP hopeful Kassim Juma, said he will accelerate development in Kwale if elected.Juma said it was unfortunate that unemployment, diseases and a high level of poverty still stalk the Coast region."We are not happy that our people still rely on relief, succumb to cholera and have no clean water yet we have leaders joining Jubilee," he said.
