IT was always a question of when, not if, politically rejuvenated Wiper supremo Kalonzo Musyoka would bolt out of NASA over the presidential ticket.With all signs clear that Raila Odinga will run away with the NASA ticket, Kalonzo has taken the plunge in the opposite direction and will now run for President under the secure umbrella of his own surrogate party ticket.That he has prepared meticulously for this eventuality is not in doubt.Main story: Wiper threat to leave NASA if Kalonzo is not selectedAlso read: Wiper downplays Nyenze's claim of 'Kalonzo going it alone' over NASA ticket rowHe first formed a coalition in his backyard with erstwhile would-be political nemesis Charity Ngilu, shed his political image of a weakling by charting his own political path away from his backers senators Johnson Muthama and David Musila, and captured Makueni Senator Kivutha Kibwana to stabilise the ship.So why is Kalonzo so fixated on printing his name on the Presidential ballot?At 63, Kalonzo is no longer a young baby-faced politician. He has been in government for 30 years, been vice president, a globetrotting Foreign Affairs minister and a latter-day opposition apologist.Now his eyes are firmly on the ultimate political prize, buoyed by the fact that he delivered the Ukambani vote to Raila by a cumulative percentage of 99.8 percent in 2013.His ego soothers say factually that Ukambani delivered better percentages to Raila than the latter&rsquo;s Luo backyard, a scenario that has driven Kalonzo to grow hard political horns to enable him to square it out with both Raila and President Uhuru Kenyatta.It&rsquo;s a political fact that the Kamba nation will want to vote for Kalonzo to a man. He is also likely to run away with a huge chunk of the coastal counties&rsquo; votes and grab neutral and sympathy votes from across the length and breadth of Kenya.What&rsquo;s his motivation?Kalonzo is a professional politician. He has whipped up the emotions of the Kamba community to maddening levels.Using this political bloc as a human shield, Kalonzo has or will do a political deal with Jubilee for purposes September 2017.Suffice it to say that this year&rsquo;s election is furiously shaping up as a repeat of 2007, when Kalonzo quickly joined then President Kibaki to form a government.Should Kalonzo starve Raila of the Kamba vote, then President Kenyatta will have a field day on August 8 because the lower eastern nation is a critical statistic for Raila.Mulila is a communications consultant
