President Uhuru Kenyatta should direct security forces to stop abusive operations as well commit to implement the Truth Justice and Reconciliation report, a state rights agency has urged.This comes as the government issued as shoot-to-kill order to deal with bandits in volatile areas.Hundreds of documented cases of extrajudicial killings in the counterterrorism operations across the country continue to dog the Jubilee administration.In a statement to the President ahead of his planned State of the Nation Address today, Kenya National Commission on Human Rights called for robust public participation that guarantees free prior consent before the start of the project.&ldquo;In your State of the Nation Address of 2015, you made a public apology to the victims of past historical injustices and setup a Sh10 billion restorative justice fund. To date, the fund is yet to be operationalised,&rdquo; said KNCHR chairperson Kagwiria Mbogori.She urged the President to expedite the fund by enacting regulations to guide reparations for victims and survivors.The delayed implementation has hurt thousands of survivors and victims who continue to suffer immense neglect and feel traumatised.The agency told Uhuru to support a working mechanism between the executive and the legislature to facilitate adoption of the TJRC report.Mbogori said the report has not seen been implemented, two years since he directed Parliament to discuss it.&ldquo;The TJRC report was a culmination of extensive hearings around the country aimed at unearthing historical injustices and fostering reconciliation,&rdquo; she said.Mbogori added, &ldquo;Our commission believes failure to adopt the recommendations continues to contribute towards the current wave of violence, insecurity and polarisation, and may persist as long as historical injustices remain unaddressed.&rdquo;The agency said its evidence-based work has seen a pattern of irregular conduct, especially by the police and Kenya Defence Forces, amounting to grave violation of human rights behind the prevalent cases of extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances.Other violations committed, especially against individuals and groups who are suspects of cases related to terror, include arbitrary arrests, extortions and illegal detention.The commission says the incidents cause mental and economic hardship to families of victims, urging Uhuru to direct the security forces to strictly operate within the rule of law.
