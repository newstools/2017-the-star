Former TNA secretary general Onyango Oloo is on the spot for illegally signing and inflating a contract by a staggering Sh1.41 billion.Oloo has found himself on the wrong side of the law after documents tabled in Parliament revealed he signed a contract for the building of the Lake Basin Development Authority mall in Kisumu yet he was not an executive chairmanUnder the laws governing the management of state corporations, non-executive board chairpersons are not allowed to execute contracts.But Oloo - who dumped President Uhuru Kenyatt&rsquo;s Jubilee Party in January for ODM and will run for Kisumu Central MP - inflated the value of the contract from Sh2.45 billion to Sh 3.86 billion.The variation was 33 per cent way above the 15 per cent allowed under procurement laws.According to documents tabled before the National Assembly Public Investments Committee, Oloo signed the revised contract on February 17, 2015.LBDA chief executive Kabok Aguko&rsquo;s signature was also appended in the varied contract.The documents were tabled by Lake Victoria Basin Board CEO Alfred Amombo.The current bank debt for the mall stands at Sh4.2 billion.PIC chairman Adan Keynan said Oloo&rsquo;s actions are reminiscent of illegal activities by former Youth Enterprise Fund boss Bruce Odhiambo.&ldquo;Why was a non-executive chairman allowed to execute a contract for the construction of the mall? This is another super chairman who is politically correct like Bruce Odhiambo, who wielded immense power which they didn&rsquo;t have legally,&rdquo; he said. MPs said the contract was null and void.
