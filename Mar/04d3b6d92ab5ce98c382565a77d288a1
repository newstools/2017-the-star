Dethroned Nairobi Provincial Cricket Association (NPCA) Twenty20 champions Kanbis will have a tough outing when the league&rsquo;s preliminary matches come to an end this weekend.Kanbis will be away to leaders Stray Lions and defending champions Swamibapa in the top of the bill fixtures on the last weekend of the first round.Despite having qualified for the semi-finals alongside their weekend opponents, Kanbis will be seeking to revenge their first leg predicaments against the two.While Swamibapa beat them heavily at home in Eastleigh, it&rsquo;s the walk out in the match against Stray Lions that made headlines.With a couple of runs to win in their chase, Kanbis players walked off the pitch protesting the umpires&rsquo; decision to give their batsman a run out, forcing the abandonment of the match. Stray Lions were awarded the match and Kanbis deducted four points.The following day, Swamibapa came calling at the same venue and rounded up Kanbis&rsquo; weekend to forget with a huge defeat, bowling them out for 81.As the three teams clash today and tomorrow at Nairobi Jafferys and Peponi School, Kanbis will be seeking to avenge that outcome, which played a significant role in as far as their current third place is concerned.The three teams will, however, be without a couple of their key players who are away with the national team in India for build up matches ahead of their crunch ICC World Cricket League Championship match against Nepal.Kanbis are without batsmen Rakep Patel and Dhiren Gondaria, all rounder Nelson Odhiambo and spinner Pushpak Kerai.Their today&rsquo;s opponents Swamibapa, will turn up at Jafferys without opening bowlers Nehemiah Odhiambo and Elijah Otieno as well as batsman Alex Obanda.At Peponi School, hosts Stray Lions will be without spinners Shem Obado and Collins Obuya.Stray Lions secretary Thota Sreenivas said the absence of their two key players is a blessing in disguise for the fringe players who have been waiting on the wings for a chance to showcase their talent.&ldquo;We have a number of players who have been waiting for a chance to play in the first team. I believe this will be a great opportunity to prove themselves,&rdquo; said Sreenivas.Obado&rsquo;s absence might not be significant since his understudy, youngster Abisheikh Chidambaran, has been impressive with the ball. He has played almost all the matches in the campaign and has lived to the expectations of the selectors.The youngster will be assisted by experienced spinners like Maurice Odumbe and Hiren Varaiya, who have continued to give him moral support whenever things don&rsquo;t seem to be going right in the middle.Despite missing their opening bowlers, Swamibapa are full off options with the ball. Lameck Onyango and Emmanuel Bundi could be entrusted with the role before they turn to their spinners, who have been impressive.They might not miss Obanda, anyway, since they too have reliable batsmen who could take up the task with ease, led by Maurice Ouma. Others are Naman Patel and Rikesh Kahar.Of the three teams, Kanbis will be hit the hardest by player absence since Rakep, Gondaria and Nelson have been some of the team&rsquo;s main contributors. They will turn to Narendra Patel and Vinod Rabadia for the much needed uplifting.Stray Lions also visit fourth-placed Nairobi Gymkhana, who will also be without Lucas Oluoch, Rushabh Patel and skipper Karan Kaul.
