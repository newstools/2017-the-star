ODM yesterday denounced President Uhuru Kenyatta as unfit for the top job following his onslaught on opposition governors and claimed his &ldquo;loose tongue&rdquo; is a sign of desperation.Seven ODM MPs led by chairman John Mbadi accused Uhuru of being hell-bent on frustrating and sabotaging Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho and his Turkana counterpart Joseph Nanok.Yesterday, Joho was barred from an event attended by Uhuru and locked up "under office arrest" until the President left town."I feel really sorry for the President because he is frustrated by the fact that he is about to leave office. All this outburst are a sign he knows he is about to lose elections," ODM director of elections Junet Mohamed said at a news conference.They called Uhuru's "rants" against the two governors "inflammatory, derogatory, contemptuous and unpresidential." On Wednesday, Uhuru called Nanok to his face a "foolish devil".Yesterday he said Joho "isn't my wife" and said he would "deal with" and "discipline him."&ldquo;The ODM Party rejects and will not allow any further unwarranted treatment our leaders are being subjected to by the Jubilee regime,&rdquo; Mbadi said at Orange House.&ldquo;It is hypocritical for the President to keep telling leaders to stop insults, yet, when cornered, he resorts to the use of unpalatable and unprintable words like &ldquo;mjinga&rdquo;, &ldquo;mshenzi&rdquo; &ldquo;shetani.&rdquo;"Going to the counties to insult, intimidate and harass Governors who are working round the clock to ensure service delivery to the people is unacceptable," Mbadi said.For some time now, the ODM official said, Jubilee has been claiming Turkana county received Sh50 billion from the national Treasury, without providing proof."We challenge the Jubilee regime to provide this data. In Mombasa, they claimed the county government has received Sh40 billion. We again challenge them to provide the evidence to this. These are utter lies. Three things cannot be hidden here in Kenya today: the sun, the moon and Jubilee incompetence," Mbadi said.On Wednesday last week, Uhuru told Turkana residents they could keep their votes on August 8. He was angry Nanok suggested Uhuru might have a personal financial interest in depriving the county of funds. He also said county-national revenue sharing over oil discoveries was unfair.At the Coast, the Jubilee machine, and the President himself, fulminated against Joho, the ODM deputy party leader."Why does he want to follow me? Am I his wife? Uhuru said after the police blocked Joho from attending the Mtongwe Ferry relaunch.Suna East MP Junet Mohamed said Uhuru was bitter because he was staring at the likelihood of being a one-term head of state.The MPs challenged Uhuru to declare his interest in Mombasa and Turkana counties and claimed he has sent anonymous people to trail the governors.&ldquo;When somebody is clearly losing, he would clutch on anything&hellip;I sympathise with him [Uhuru] because he is a frustrated man,&rdquo; Mohamed said.ODM Treasurer Timothy Bosire claimed Uhuru was using crude force to confuse Kenyans after failing to deliver for a record fours years.Bosire said the Jubilee administration has been known for nothing but blatant tribalism and big money graft &ldquo;It's shameful and wrong for a sitting governor to be denied his constitutional right in his own county (to attend a public function) Mbalambala MP Abdikadir Aden said.Yesterday, Bosire recalled how Uhuru&rsquo;s father, President Jomo Kenyatta hurled insults at Nyanza residents in a visit to Kisumu in 1969. It turned violent.Kenyatta told Jaramogi, father of opposition chief Raila Odinga, that had they not been friends, he would have "crushed him like flour" and then continued in unprintable language.
