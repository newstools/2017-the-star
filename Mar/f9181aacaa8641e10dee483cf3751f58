Tension is still high in the Marioshoni and Kiptunga areas of Molo after irate youths set ablaze 15 vehicles belonging to Comply Industries Limited.Molo police boss Daniel Kamanza said security has been beefed up to calm the situation.&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of tension but we are urging residents to remain calm. Investigations into this matter have started to bring the culprits to book. We are at the scene of the incident [inside the Kiptunga Forest] to tow the vehicles to Elburgon police station and clear the scene,&rdquo; Kamanza said.The head of Mau Conservancy, who is also a senior assistant director at the Kenya Forest Service, Cosmas Ikiugu, said the issue had been politicised.He said the Ogiek community should not complain of not benefitting from the forest because the section Comply Industries personnel were harvesting trees in could not be allocated to them for lack of capacity to cut them.Ikugu said two licenses had been given to the Ogiek to manage a blue gum plantation within the forest and that the local community forest association was aware of that.On Monday, six lorries, six loaders, one Land Cruiser, a small truck and a bulldozer were set ablaze. This was after a Comply Industries truck transporting logs from the Kiptunga Forest ran over two passengers, riding on a motorbike and killed them on the spot. The Land Cruiser was set ablaze at Marishoni trading centre, while two other lorries were burnt at the scene of the accident.Locals, led by Kiptunga Forest Association chairman Joseph Lesingo, blamed KFS for cancelling a timber harvesting license given to the locals.They blamed the death of the two people on speeding and carelessness.Timber Manufacturers&rsquo; Association National Chairman Bernard Gitau condemned the incident.&ldquo;We regret the loss of lives. It could have been an accident. Residents should not have taken law into their hands by burning the vehicles,&rdquo; Gitau said.Comply Industries, a sister company to giant timber manufacturing companies Timsales and Raiply, is based in Nakuru and is a leading manufacturer of timber products such as plywood, blockboard and hardboard, among others.
