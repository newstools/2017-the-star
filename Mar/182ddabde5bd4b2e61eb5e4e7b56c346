Athletics Kenya relay series continue tomorrow with the second of the five-legged competition at Nairobi West Prisons grounds.More elite sprint runners are expected in the half-day competition as the craving for standard qualifying times to the 2017 World Relays Championships in Bahamas dictate their training.As it happened last weekend during the opening at the same venue, the sprinters will continue warming-up in their specialties during the first three meetings before forming their respective teams.The opening three meetings are open to individuals running in 100m, 200m, 400m and 800metres while the last two legs will be dedicated toteam relays.Newcomers will be testing their new-found sprinting abilities with Ferdinand Omanyala, Emmanuel Lentukunye, Rose Watakwa and Patricia Isisi billed to better their timings.Apart from those who participated last weekend, a better transmission will come from big timers in Mary Tanui, Maureen Thomas and Eglay Nalianya who joins Sylvia Chesebe and Grace Kidake in the women&rsquo;s entries.In the men&rsquo;s edition, Mark Otieno and Peter Mwai will have worthy challengers in Gilbert Otieno and Mike Mokamba while one-lapper, Boniface Mweresa, the All Africa Games silver medallist, will face off with Stanley Kieti and Alphas Kishoyan, both of whom were missing in action last Saturday.The relays build-ups, spread over one month, will conclude with the national trials on April 1 where Team Kenya will be selected to represent the country at the IAAF World Relays Championships set for Nassau, Bahamas on April 22 and 23 this year.
