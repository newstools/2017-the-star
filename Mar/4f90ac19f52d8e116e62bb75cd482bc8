City Hall spent Sh16 million to hire a road grader instead of using Sh610,000 to repair a grounded one because it does not have enough machines. Transport executive Mohamed Abdullahi yesterday said the Sh16 million was not spent on leasing one equipment, but "a number of them" for one year.&ldquo;We have four graders but only one has a few problems because of its age. The others are working but they are not enough,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;So we contacted a firm that we are paying Sh16 million per year. And I think that is not bad.&rdquo; Two weeks ago Transport chief officer Michael Ngare told MCAs that the city spent the amount to lease the equipment last year, but he did not explain why it did not repair the grounded one. He said that the county has three graders &mdash; one is broken, while the other two have been withheld by the supplier over nonpayment of Sh46 million. &ldquo;One has been grounded due to lack of tyres,&rdquo; Ngare said.He was responding to Kahawa West MCA Ngaruiya Chege's question about the number of graders the county owns and, if any were grounded. Ngaruiya said he was disturbed by the poor state of roads.But speaking to the Star on the phone, Abdullahi said the county leased the equipment because it does not have enough machines for road repairs.The MCAs urged the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission to investigate the transport officers.&ldquo;Someone must be benefiting from the hiring of these machines. What is the priority and why is public money being spent this way?&rdquo; Ngaruiya said.But Abdullahi accused the MCAs of "playing politics with development.&rdquo;Last week, the Kenya Alliance of Resident Associations told Governor Evans Kidero in meeting at Crowne Plaza that they are grappling with bad roads, traffic congestion and poor drainage.&ldquo;Sh610,000 will be used to repair the stalled grader, which requires six tyres.&rdquo; Ngare said.
