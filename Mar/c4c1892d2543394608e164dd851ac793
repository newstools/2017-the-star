Paul Were thus has been called up to camp in light of the aforementioned,&rdquo; said the statement from FKF. The call up of Were provides him with the opportunity to cement his place in the national set up, having been one of the bright spots at the start of Stanley Okumbi&rsquo;s reign Yesterday the national team had a closed double session at 10am and 4pm respectively. Congo, meanwhile, began jetting into the country yesterday and are being hosted at the Kenya School of Monetary Studies facilities.

Uganda Cranes on the other hand, were expected to jet into the country yesterday morning and will also be staying at KSMS for the duration they will be in Kenya.

Who had influenced Lamptey to help South Africa win the match was not addressed in Fifa&rsquo;s statement on Monday.However, the world ruling body did say: &ldquo;Further information concerning the South Africa v. Senegal match in question will be provided once the decision becomes final and binding&rdquo;.Fifa officials, who did not want to be named, told Reuters match-fixing was uncovered following irregular betting activity.South Africa&rsquo;s Football Association (SAFA) did not respond on Monday to questions about the match-fixing allegations.The revelation follows allegations that South Africa paid a $10 million bribe to help secure the rights to the 2010 World Cup and that officials were duped by an Asian betting syndicate over the results of warm-up matches before the finals.Although South Africa&rsquo;s Sports Minister Fikile Mbalula rejected the bribery allegation a year ago, the scandals have tarnished the legacy of the World Cup, said local experts.
