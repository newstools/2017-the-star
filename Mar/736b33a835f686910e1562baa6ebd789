Sirisia MP John Waluke has said the Luhyas will not support NASA if either ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi or Ford Kenya&rsquo;s Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula are picked as the joint presidential candidate.Speaking yesterday at Mayuba Stadium in Sirisia, Waluke said failure by the opposition to pick one of the two will benefit Jubilee.&ldquo;We have no business supporting the opposition if another person is nominated. Let the four principals agree and pick either Mudavadi or Wetang&rsquo;ula,&rdquo; the Jubilee MP said.Waluke was elected on an ODM ticket but defected to Jubilee. He said Luhyas will not vote for Raila Odinga anymore.The interim Jubilee Party Bungoma town chairman said the community will support JP, but not a candidate who will lose the election.The lawmaker said Jubilee is doing well in the county and they are going to launch a massive campaign to ensure they win the majority of seats on August 8.&ldquo;We will support President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto if the opposition does not pick a Luhya for the top seat,&rdquo; Waluke said. He added that NASA is showing signs of picking Raila as the flagbearer and Wiper&rsquo;s Kalonzo Musyoka his running mate. Wetang&rsquo;ula and Mudavadi do not seem to have a chance, the MP said.Waluke said Jubilee has initiated mega projects in Western, reason for the region to reelect him.&ldquo;We are telling our people not to gamble with their votes but choose a development-conscious administration.&rdquo; he said.
