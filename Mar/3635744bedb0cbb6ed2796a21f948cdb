The management of a freight business associated with Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho said the company is not evading tax and should be granted time to clear its arrears.Portside Freight Terminal moved to the High Court in Mombasa seeking a 30-day extension to allow it pay Sh90 million tax demanded by the Kenya Revenue Authority.Lawyer Paul Buti urged the court to hear the suit expeditiously so the company does not suffer as a consequence of KRA&rsquo;s &ldquo;unlawful&rdquo; actions.KRA had made an immediate tax demand to the freight terminal. The money demanded includes accumulated taxes, penalties and interest.Buti asked the court to prohibit KRA from demanding, collecting or issuing agency notices for tax for 2008-2011.A February 3 KRA letter says, &ldquo;You are also requested to avail the financial documents, including copies of bank statements for the years 2013, 2014 and 2015 as requested earlier.&rdquo;Buti said his client does not agree with the amount of money stated as tax accrued. The company also says the requirement to pay the taxes immediately is against the law.Buti said if the tax amount is deficit, it should be carried forward under the Income Tax Act for the period.On January 28, KRA closed Portside and Autoports Freight Terminal, also associated with Joho&rsquo;s family, accusing the firms of handling smuggled goods, including sugar, ethanol and rice.The matter will be mentioned on March 28.
