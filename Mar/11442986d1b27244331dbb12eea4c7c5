Only petitions contesting presidential poll results will be allowed at the Supreme Court if fresh amendments to the Election Act are passed.The Elections Laws (Amendment) Bill 2017 seeks to ensure petitioners only appeal decisions of one lower court.The Bill was tabled for the First Reading yesterday by National Assembly Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs chairman Samuel Chepkonga.For instance, someone challenging the election of an MCA would only be allowed to seek redress at the High Court, if his petition was unsuccessful at the resident magistrate&rsquo;s court.The High Court&rsquo;s decision would be final.MP and governor petitions can go up to the Court of Appeal and the decision made there will be final.Petitions on the election of MPs and governors initially go to the High Court.The Elections Act has been silent on what happens to an unsuccessful petition once it is heard at the Court of Appeal.After the 2013 election, aspirants whose petitions were unsuccessful at the High Court and Court of Appeal ran to the Supreme Court.The Bill also outlines provisions that allow for petitions concerning the allocation of party list seats for nominated MPs.Such petitions are to be filed in the High Court and its decision challenged at the Court of Appeal, whose decision will be final.The Bill also amends Section 40 ( 2 ) of the Political Parties Act to empower the Political Parties Disputes Tribunal to determine disagreements from party primaries.Section 41( 2 ) will also be amended to allow an appeal from the decision of the tribunal to be filed in the High Court. The decision will be final.Last month, the Judiciary said 188 election petitions were filed in courts, following the March 4, 2013 General Election.The first petition was that of then Cord principal Raila Odinga in which he contested President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s win.In a strategic plan published by the Judiciary Committee on Elections covering 2016 to 2019, the committee anticipates the number of the petitions to go up after the August 8 election.The JCE was formed in 2015 to replace the Judiciary Working Committee on Election Preparations, which was initiated in 2012 as a temporary agency to help prepare for the 2013 polls.Its task was to advise the Judiciary on the administrative arrangements and dealing with election-related disputes.Chief Justice David Maraga said the Judiciary is determined to hear petitions fairly.Last December, Maraga said there are likely to be more petitions because the Judiciary has taught citizens their democratic rights.He said elections have attracted enormous public attention and legal battles.
