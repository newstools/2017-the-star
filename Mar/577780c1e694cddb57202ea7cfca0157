It was funded through a grant from the Japanese government.Expansion includes building a four-vehicle lane and service roads, as well as pedestrian and bicycle lanes.A special lane will be built for public service buses. Automated traffic lights will be installed at major intersections.&ldquo;We need to bring to an end the suffering of many Kenyans who ...
