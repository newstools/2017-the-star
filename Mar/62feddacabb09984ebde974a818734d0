South African airport
customs officials have confiscated male sexual enhancement
tablets worth 20.6 million rand ($1.63 million) en route to
Swaziland from India, the revenue service said on Monday. Customs officers found 80,000 tablets and 126,000 oral
jellies in transit sheds at Johannesburg's OR Tambo airport on
Sunday. The pills were wrapped in brown sacks sent from Mumbai. "These tablets are restricted and controlled substances and
must have permits when being imported," the South African
Revenue Service (SARS) said in a statement. "The shipment has been handed over to the Medical Council of
South Africa for further investigation." SARS spokesman Sandile Memela said the police would
investigate who had sent the pills and the intended recipient.
