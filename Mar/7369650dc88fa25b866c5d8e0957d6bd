Sirisia MP John Waluke has accused executives of letting Bungoma Governor Kenneth Lusaka down.He said has said the executives have sabotaged Lusaka.Waluke was speaking in Mayuba Stadium on Wednesday during celebrations to mark the International Women's Day.He said the executives have done things that have ashamed Lusaka and made him look bad in the eyes of the electorate.''As our first governor, Lusaka is a very cool guy who is development-oriented, but his weakness of being very polite and soft has made these ministers turn against him, doing things that one cannot understand,'' Waluke said.He urged residents to vote Lusaka back and let him accomplish the development projects he has started.''We want Lusaka to finish his two terms and let us assist him in selecting a good cabinet that will be loyal and work together to lift the county,'' he said.Waluke said executives and county officials have been doing shoddy projects across the nine constituencies and do not invite MPs for "some very important events".''It is alleged Sh1 million had been set aside for this event, yet it looks like it cost Sh50,000. That is why even the MPs were not invited,'' he said. Waluke said Lusaka made a terrible mistake by appointing some executives who have worked day and night to see his administration painted as a failed regime.He urged residents to vote wisely on August 8.
