Matatu owners have threatened to block highways countrywide if Probox cars working as PSV are not removed.Matatu Owners Association chairman Simon Kimutai said the presence of the 5-seater cars was hurting their business.He said the Proboxes have continued to operate despite attempts to engage the police in efforts to get rid of them."We will not sit and see our business die. We can't wait to die. We are not going to the graveside without any action," Kimutai said.Kimutai said the vehicles do not pay for PSV licenses and do not have insurance cover for passengers."While this goes on, they have been allocated pick-up and drop-off points by some county governments," he said.The transporter spoke during the MOA governing council meeting at a hotel in Nairobi on Friday.Kimutai said corrupt traffic cops have left the illegal business to thrive since they are pocketing millions of shillings from the operators."Use of Probox as PSV is an illegal business," he said, adding that trumped up charges by cops costs the matatu sector billions of shillings."The law enforcement officers are collecting revenue for their own benefit," he said.He said all MOA members have been instructed to provide their crews with cameras to record activities of the police on the road."The footage will be shared with relevant authorities for action," Kimutai said.He said the paltry Sh80,000 earned from PSVs per month cannot help owners meet loan obligations which amount to Sh120,000."We also have to pay insurance and other charges. The police are killing our businesses," Kimutai said. Read: You can t ban Probox, youth need them to earn income Rutto
