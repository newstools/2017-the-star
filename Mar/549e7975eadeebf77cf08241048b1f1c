Jubilee will roll out vigorous campaigns in Western to popularise the party, Bungoma Governor Kenneth Lusaka has said. ''We are waiting for the NASA people to name their preferred candidate and then we meet them in the field. I want to tell them that it's going to be more fire,'' he said on Thursday. Lusaka, who is Western region's Jubilee point man, said the party is
not taking chances and will work hard to retain victory in the August 8
polls. ''We are one thing and we have begun our campaigns. They
are going to feel the heat because we are not interested in this petty
funeral politics that our opposition brothers are engaged in,'' he said.
