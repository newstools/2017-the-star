Agriculture CS Willy Bett has assured farmers who applied for government-subsidised fertiliser they will receive it.He said there is demand for 650,000 tonnes of fertiliser, but the government can only afford to buy 200,000 tonnes.Bett spoke in Kitale town on Sunday after launchign the fertiliser distribution programme. He urged farmers to join cooperatives to have easier access to fertiliser.The government has spent Sh5.3 billion to supply subsidised fertiliser to farmers this year.Bett said that although the subsidy programme was targetted towards smallholder farmers, large-scale farmers will also have access to the fertiliser.The CS said farmers who need more bags than will be allocated should liaise with the managers of depots for vetting.Bett said, &ldquo;If the number of famers who register with cooperatives increases, the fertiliser will be brought down to the subcounties to cut the cost of transportation.&rdquo;He said this will reduce time wasting.Bett said the government will help the areas worst affected by the drought.&ldquo;The government will buy animals and the meat will be taken to the Kenya Meat Commission,&rdquo; Bett said.
