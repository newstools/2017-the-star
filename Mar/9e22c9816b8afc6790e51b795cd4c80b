Bandari striker Dan Sserenkuma is back in Mombasa after an unsuccessful month-long trial in South Africa.The pint-sized proven goalgetter returned to Mombasa on Monday and immediately joined the rest of the squad in training in readiness for the yet to be scheduled Kenyan Premier League.While confirming Sserunkuma&rsquo;s return, Bandari secretary Edward Oduor expressed optimism that he will be of great help to the squad.&ldquo;We had wished him well but I think the time was too short for him to convince the hosts, coupled with the fact that the transfer period was almost ending,&rdquo; Oduor said.He said Sserenkuma will link up with Enock Agwanda and Jacob Keli, previously of Gor Mahia in an attack that is is expected to trouble their opponents once action commences.&ldquo;I think we are now good to go and could have wished that the fixtures are released as soon as yesterday to show our opponents what we are made of,&rdquo; Oduor said.Odour appealed to Kenyan Premier League and Football Kenya Federation to drop their hardline stands to allow for the league kick off.&ldquo;This standoff is not good for any sport and it&rsquo;s therefore high time the two groups realised this and dropped everything for the sake of the game,&rdquo; Oduor said.
