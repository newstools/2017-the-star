The governor race in Baringo, the birthplace of retired President Daniel Moi, is heating up, with incumbent Benjamin Cheboi, trying to shrug off Kanu&rsquo;s growing influence.Cheboi, who is seeking reelection on the Jubilee ticket, is facing competition from Knut Koibatek branch executive secretary Stanley Kiptis and former Kenya School of Government director Isaac Chebon.The incumbent is a bit relieved after his main rival, Betting Control and Licensing Board director Simon Chelugui, was reportedly convinced by Deputy President William Ruto in December, to vie for Senate. The seat is occupied by Kanu chairman and fierce DP Ruto critic Gideon Moi.Chelugui was Kiptis running mate in 2013, after losing the URP ticket to Cheboi, a former Higher Education Loans Board chief executive officer. Kiptis came second and will be no pushover in the August.DP RUTO&rsquo;S ALLEGED INTEFERENCEDP Ruto has been criticised for &ldquo;interfering with the county politics&rdquo;, with leaders telling him to let the people elect the leaders they want. But Chelugui&rsquo;s decision to stand for senator, according to many, will not give Cheboi a guaranteed win, given he will still face Kiptis in the Jubilee primaries.&ldquo;Cheboi has to up his game because Kiptis is working very hard, if he is to buoy his popularity to the end,&rdquo; a resident told the Star on Friday.Although his opponents acknowledge various projects such as ECDE classrooms, roads, water and health have been done, issues about the quality of workmanship and delayed completion have been raised.They also claim acute water shortage, especially in the arid and semi-arid areas is still persistent.In his defence, Governor Cheboi has told his rivals to get to the ground and see the transformation the county has the undergone rather than relying on hearsay.&ldquo;Everything that we have done is visible for those who want to see,&rdquo; he said.KANU&rsquo;S INFLUENCE AND POPULARITYAlthough Kanu&rsquo;s influence and popularity is growing in the county, Governor Cheboi categorically said Baringo remains a Jubilee zone.This position is supported by seven area MPs &mdash; William Cheptumo (Baringo North), Sammy Mwaita ( Baringo Central), Grace Kipchoim (Baringo South), Moses Lessonet (Eldama Ravine), Hellen Sambili (Mogotio), Asman Kamama (Tiaty) and Woman representative Grace Kiptui .But Senator Moi has teamed up with other Rift Valley leaders, among them Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto of the Chama cha Mashinani, West Pokot Senator John Lonyangapuo, former Information minister Samuel Phogisio, former Inspector General of Police David Kimaiyo and county speaker William Kamket to chip away at Jubilee&rsquo;s popularity.The anti-Jubilee group argue that other than neglecting the region in terms of development, the government has not remained silent as residents die and lose their livestock due to the ongoing drought and banditry attacks.&ldquo;The people of Baringo and West Pokot, counties purported to be Jubilee zones, have been left in destitution by the government,&rdquo; Senator Lonyangapuo says.ABOUT THE COUNTYThe county also has minerals treasures such as rubies, manganese and diatomite deposits, which are expected to be opened up to investors.Tullow Oil is currently undertaking groundwork logistics in readiness for exploration of crude oil in the Kerio Valley, Baringo North, and parts of Tiaty.The Geothermal Development Company is also exploring how to harness 7,000MW of geothermal power at the Silale Belt in Tiaty.DEVELOPMENT PROJECTSIn an interview at his office late last month, Governor Cheboi said he has won public trust and support in the past four years because of the development projects he has initiated.He said his government has constructed 440 ECDE classrooms, and hired 1,860 teachers. He has allocated Sh120 million for secondary school and Tertiary and Vocational Education Training bursaries.Cheboi said his government, in collaboration with the Japan International Corporation Agency, has sunk 127 boreholes, 25 water pans, all spread across the lower arid and semi-arid areas.In addition, he said over 146 water projects to reach communities in the highlands and lowlands through the gravity system, pipeline extensions and construction of storage tanks have helped 65 per cent of the people have access to water.&ldquo;We acknowledge the fact that 70 per cent of the county is ASAL, and we have managed, with little resources we gave, to increase access to water from 25.9 to 65 per cent,&rdquo; Cheboi said.The governor said the county targets to irrigate 10,000 acres of land, up from the current 2,500 acres, spread in 13 irrigation schemes, mostly in Baringo South, Mogotio, Baringo North and Tiaty.On roads, 60km have been upgraded to bitumen standard in Kabarnet, Kabartonjo, Mogotio, Marigat and Eldama Ravine.&ldquo;Some 2,800km more require upgrading and we urge the national government to fast-tract the Marigat-Mochongio-Karandi, Tenges-Oinobmoi-Kinyach and Kipsaraman-Kinyach and Mogotio-Lake Bogoria roads that residents have always complained about.Additionally the county, according to the governor, has embarked on a two-year Sh300 million interest-free loan plan in partnership with the Kenya Commercial Bank, under the &ldquo;Mifugo ni Mali&rdquo; programme. It is aimed at upgrading livestock from local breed to pedigree.&ldquo;The animal&rsquo; value addition initiative will help farmers improve their livestock and increased meat and milk production,&rdquo; the governor said.In health, 27 new dispensaries have constructed,15 of them in Tiaty and Kabarnet Hospital has been upgraded to a Level 5 facility with CT-scans, dialysis services, digital X-Ray, ICU unit and an oxygen plant, which is underway. Refurbishing of buildings and wards has also been done.Construction of a five-storey casualty wing, with a 380-bed capacity is on course. In Eldama Ravine Hospital, a new 32-bed modern maternity wing with CT-scans and a digital X-ray has been built.The new Mogotio Level 4 Hospital is now awaiting equipping and staffing. Theatres in Kabartonjo, Marigat, Emining and Chemolingot are under construction.As agreed by the county and the nurses union, 117 new staff have been employed, those under ESP programme were confirmed and others promoted. More personnel are required, but the governor said money is still a challenge.
