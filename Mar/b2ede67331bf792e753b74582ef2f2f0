ODM leader Raila Odinga has asked their Jubilee competitors to stop meddling in the affairs of the National Super Alliance.He urged members of the President Uhuru Kenyatta's party to 'concentrate on their losing campaign'.Raila said the issue of the coalition's presidential standard bearer will be resolved as soon as possible."Let NASA be. The flag bearer issue is our problem. Not yours. Don't be worried," he said in Mombasa on Saturday.Jubilee has been pushing NASA to name the candidate who will take on Uhuru and Deputy President William Ruto on August 8.Ruto recently dismissed the opposition outfit as clueless, saying they have no clear vision for Kenyans.Read: Ruto scoffs at NASA&rsquo;s parallel poll tallying centre planRaila told Coast ODM aspirants that they are closer to naming the alliance's candidate, adding it is the reason Jubilee is panicking."Soon, you will see the white smoke," Raila said, dismissing the 'black smoke' coming from the NASA matter as a smokescreen."The black smoke you see is our strategy. We have been doing that on purpose. That is our game plan," Raila said.The opposition chief, who was accompanied by deputy party leader Hassan Joho, said they are confident of victory after the polls.He said Uhuru and Ruto are only turning a blind eye to the anger Kenyans have against them."Sometimes, I ask myself which country they live in," Raila added.Uhuru and Ruto have said on many occasions that they are confident of beating the NASA team.The lot says they did it while out of government in 2013 and therefore it will be easy when they are at the helm.However, Raila on Saturday the two only got sympathy votes due to the cases at the International Criminal Court.Uhuru, while in Kisii on Wednesday last week, said Raila was the one who ignited the fire that led to the 2007/08 post-poll chaos.At the said time, the country exploded following the declaration that President Mwai Kibaki, now retired, won the election.The incident left at least 1,333 dead and 650,000 displaced from their homes and businesses.Raila said Uhuru is only being a hypocrite on matters related to the post-election skirmishes."Kenyans have now seen their (Uhuru and Ruto's) true colours. They have failed to deliver on their promises.""What work have they done apart from spreading propaganda to hoodwink Kenyans?" Raila asked.He said the Standard Gauge Railway was a project of the Grand coalition government which he and Kibaki headed."We designed it and awarded the tender to a company. They [Jubilee government] cancelled the tender, re-advertised it and gave the same company the tender but this time with a different price," Raila said."If the 7,000km of roads Jubilee claims to have constructed were true, all roads in the country would be tarmacked today," the NASA co-principal added.[VIDEO] Raila 'ignited fire' that led to 2007/8 post-election violence, says UhuruRead: Raila lashes out at 'desperate' Uhuru over post election violence claims
