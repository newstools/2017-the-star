Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua has asked the EACC to audit all leaders and not selectively scrutinise governors for corruption.He said, however, he supports the EACC plan by the EACC to audit governors, who have been linked to graft. &ldquo;If you have pocketed public money and you are a governor, MCA, senator, MP, or a CS, you are a thief,&rdquo; Mutua said. He spoke on Saturday in Embu after opening the Maendeleo Chap Chap offices. Mutua said the lifestyles of most leaders changed after they took office. He said some of them built magnificent residences, industries and hotels, yet their public servants&rsquo; salaries cannot finance their changed circumstances.
