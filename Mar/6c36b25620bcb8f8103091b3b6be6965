A third of the food available never makes it from the farm to the table, according to the Food and Agricultural Organisation, this is enough food to feed all of the world&rsquo;s 1.2 billion hungry or undernourished people.The UN food agency has said 40 per cent of losses occur before the food hits the market. It is lost during and immediately following harvest, as well as in processing and transport. Agriculture CS Willy Bett said there is little or no research done on post-harvest loss in Africa.Stakeholders should come up with ideas and solutions that can reduce food loss, he said. About 30 per cent of the grains produced and close to 90 per cent of fruits and vegetables are lost before they reach the consumers, owing to inadequate post-harvest management, lack of structured markets, inadequate storage in households and on farms, and limited processing capacity.Bett spoke yesterday during the first All Africa Post-harvest Losses Congress in Nairobi attended by 600 delegates. The congress was hosted by the University of Nairobi in partnership with a consortium of Kenyan universities.
