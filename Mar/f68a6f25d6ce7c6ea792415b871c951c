A mother-of-five at Mororo slum, Madogo, Tana River county, urgently requires Sh200,000 for her baby’s head surgery. Faith Kasangi’s three-month-old son suffers from congenital hydrocephalus, which is the buildup of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain. Normally, this fluid cushions the brain. An unusually large head is the main symptom of the condition. Baby Jeremiah Chuma needs to be operated on to drain the fluid. Well-wishers can reach Kasangi on 0701 534 714. Kasangi said Jeremiah started to develop the condition two weeks after she gave birth normally at the Garissa Referral Hospital on December 4. The single mother took Jeremiah to Garissa Referral, where he was admitted for a month after he was diagnosed with pneumonia. His head started to swell while he was undergoing treatment. Last month the hospital referred her to Kijabe Mission Hospital,where she was asked for a Sh200,000 deposit before the child could be admitted. She had no choice but to go back to Garissa, whose doctors were on strike. Kasangi does manual work. She said she cannot fend for her children because Jeremiah totally depends on her. “Already my eldest daughter has been sent home and she staying with my parents in Ukambani,” Kasangi said.
