Some Jubilee Party MPs yesterday dismissed reports that they are in panic mode after NASA &lsquo;raided&rsquo; their strongholds.Speaking at Parliament Buildings, the legislators said President Uhuru Kenyatta will beat the NASA presidential candidate and JP will win most parliamentary and ward posts at the August election.They include MPs Aden Duale (Garissa Town), Joyce Laboso (Sotik) and Oscar Sudi (Kapseret), senators Kimani Wamatangi (Kiambu), Peter Mositet (Kajiado), Martha Wangari (nominated) and Joy Gwendo (nominated).Duale said it is a farfetched dream for NASA to think that the huge crowds at their rallies in Jubilee zones are a sign that they support the opposition.&ldquo;Cord or NASA must be in slumberland to think that they are eating into Jubilee&rsquo;s support base,&rdquo; he said &ldquo;They were in Bomet county the other day, where a huge crowd attended their rally, but as soon as they left the county, the residents told them that they were behind Uhuru and [Deputy President William] Ruto. NASA will only think so to their own disadvantage.&rdquo;Wamatangi said Jubilee&rsquo;s traditional bastions of Masaailand, Meru and Elgeyo Marakwet are still intact and more counties that did not support Jubilee in the 2013 elections have now joined &ldquo;the winning team&rdquo;.&ldquo;The opposition should be made aware that Jubilee will win the August election and many Kenyans are aware of that,&rdquo; he said.Wangari and Gwendo said the opposition should be ready to face another defeat as JP&rsquo;s game plan is way ahead that of NASA.NASA leaders Raila Odinga (ODM), Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper), Musalia Mudavadi (ANC) and Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula (Ford Kenya) have held rallies in Uasin Gishu, Meru and Tharaka Nithi counties, attracting huge crowds. But Jubilee leaders have said the crowds do not translate into votes.
