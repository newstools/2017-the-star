The High Court yesterday reduced a life sentence imposed on a Ugandan millionaire businessman to 30 years in jail for drug trafficking after a successful appeal.John Mugisha has been held in Kenya prisons since 2010 and he was in the news headlines after cocaine worth Sh85 million stashed in UN diplomatic bags intercepted at the JKIA was linked to him.The drugs were being transported from Peru to Uganda through JKIA, Nairobi.The court also gave him a Sh120 million fine, a significant reduction from the earlier Sh254 million in the former conviction. If he does not pay the fine, he will serve an extra year in default.He had been sentenced to serve life imprisonment alongside Anne Bisaso, who was found with the drugs. Bisaso did not file an appeal.Justice Ngenya Macharia said the drugs were never directly found in Mugisha&rsquo;s possession, but that he had been nailed on the strength of &ldquo;circumstantial evidence&rdquo; relating to an address that confirmed that he would be recipient of the drugs.Mugisha&rsquo;s appeal is pegged on the fact that no drugs were found in his possession, but the prosecution proved that he processed Bisaso&rsquo;s travel documents and the keys to the diplomatic boxes that were impounded were found on him.In sentencing them, a magistrate concurred that they were co-conspirators in drug trafficking.The court said Mugisha has a previous conviction in Kenya for attempting to stage a jail break from Kamiti Prison and is serving a two-year sentence for the offence.But the judge said yesterday, "The parcel was addressed to you and I am convinced that the recipient was yourself as you would not have booked travel ticket. The investigation was meticulous and it chained you to the events."
