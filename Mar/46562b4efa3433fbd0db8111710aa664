On Thursday, National Super Alliance co-principal Raila Odinga dismissed the plan saying it was misinformed, considering the high number of young qualified Kenyan doctors who lack jobs."It is disappointing that the government is seeking to recruit 500 foreign doctors yet there are hundreds of doctors looking for work," Raila said."We need to invest in resolving our policy problems in a way that leaves our citizens motivated and willing to serve our country."He said the recent doctors strike was brought about by the many hiccups in the management of the health sector.More on this: Shelve plan to hire 500 Tanzanian doctors, employ jobless graduates - RailaAlso read: NASA threatens to stop importation of doctors from Tanzania
