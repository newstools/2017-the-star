Youth Affairs CS Sicily Kariuki has told politicians to stop politicising the National Youth Service projects.She accused some politicians, whom she did not name, of fighting empowerment projects initiated by the national government.Kariuki underscored the importance of the initiative and urged leaders to support it, saying it has the capacity to transform many lives.She said the projects resolve joblessness and provide livelihoods for many Kenyans.Kariuki spoke on Friday during the launch of the Youth Empowerment Programme on Budera Farm in Budalang&rsquo;i, Busia.She described the NYS project as one of a kind, adding that it has benefitted 106,000 youths in 107 constituencies.Kariuki cautioned politicians against interfering with the project, saying no amount of intimidation or cheap politics out to derail the project will be entertained.&ldquo;The major aim of this viable project is to empower the youth to be self-dependent economically,&rdquo; she said.The CS urged the youth to own the project and be its first line of defence so that it meets it goal.&ldquo;I will blame you if the project fails,&rdquo; she said.Budalang&rsquo;i MP Ababu Namwamba lauded the NYS for doing a lot in Budalang&rsquo;i since 1964 on matters of flood mitigation.He said the CDF committee will allocate cash to buy land for construction of an NYS centre.Namwamba said the 900 youths who have been recruited into the project, will, among other things, rehabilitate dykes, rural access roads and water channels.Namwamba also praised the national government for initiating development projects in Budalang&rsquo;i, citing ongoing construction of the Sh1billion Sigiri Bridge.Last month, the CS said they target to cover all constituencies to reach as many young people as possible.&ldquo;This programme is one of the government&rsquo;s flagship projects aimed at achieving Vision 2030,&rdquo; Kariuki said.&ldquo;This is not just any other normal project, but one which will bring a positive impact to the lives of our youth.&rdquo;
