More than Sh200 million was raised on Thursday evening in a party to strategise on Governor Evans Kidero s reelection campaign.The invite-only event at the Nairobi Club was attended by 300 people, including the governor s family, friends, politicians and businesspeople.NASA principals Raila Odinga, Kalozo Musyoka, Moses Wetang ula and Musalia Mudavadi did not attend but sent representatives. The law bars politicians seeking elective seats from contributing to harambees. Kidero already has a formidable war chest.Kidero is expected to be the NASA candidate, as no one else has declared interest. It is said he has assembled his team and will soon launch his reelection campaign. We don t need to publicise everything we do. The kind of campaigns we are going to mount, I assure you, nobody will match. Let the others make noise, we are studying them, a source familiar with the campaign, said.The Jubilee ticket has attracted five candidates , including Senator Mike Sonko, Dagoretti South MP Dennis Waweru, nominated MP Johnston Sakaja, former Starehe MP Margaret Wanjiru and former presidential candidate Peter Kenneth.
