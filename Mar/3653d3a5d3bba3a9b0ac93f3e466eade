The government has extended the 12-hour curfew imposed in Mandera on December 27 last year by three months.Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery said the order applies to Mandera Town, Omar Jillo, Arabia, Fino, Lafey Kotulo, and Elwak.The curfew also applies to environs of the said locations, extending 20km from the Kenya-Somalia border. In a special Gazette notice, Nkaissery said the curfew will be effective between 7pm - 5am daily.The previous one was enforced from 6.30 pm to 6.30 am. "Persons living in the area are expected to remain indoors in the premises at which they reside or such other as authorised," Nkaissery said. "Exceptions from this requires a written permit granted by the respective deputy county commissioner of the affected areas."The curfew is as a result of security measures placedby government to ward off al Shabaab, whose operations are mainly executed at night.The restrictions were issued following an attack targeting non-locals at a lodging in Bishaare that left 12 people dead.The attackers used improvised explosive devices to break the lodging's metallic doors.Earlier this year, al shabaab attacked Kulbiyow KDF base, an incident that left a number of soldiers dead.Read: Kulbiyow deaths surpass KDF number, al Shabaab releases photos On Monday, KDF killed 31 militants during an ambush targeting al Shabaab bases.
