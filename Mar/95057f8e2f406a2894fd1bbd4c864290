Massive corruption in the counties derails development, Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka has said. It also slows down the achievement of gains envisaged in devolved governance due to wastage of public funds, he said yesterday.Kalonzo added that inflating the cost of goods harms economic growth, as rogue contractors have a field day in the counties.Delays by the national government to disburse funds to the counties is the biggest avenue to corruption, the Wiper leader said.&ldquo;The delays mean that contractors bribe county officials to expedite their payments,&rdquo; Kalonzo said.He spoke during the ongoing devolution conference at the Kenya Wildlife Service Training Institute in Naivasha.Jail term for corrupt leadersThe NASA co-principal said that NASA would jail those found guilty of corruption and other economic crimes once they assume power.Kalonzo warned that governors would be held personally accountable if their counties are found to be ravaged with graft.&ldquo;I will give an example of Nigeria where almost all the first governors are spending their life in jail due to corruption. And while I am not threatening you, you should be cautious of how you spend public money,&rdquo; he said.Fruits of devolutionKalonzo said devolution is making positive impacts to Kenyans, even in far-flung areas in Kenya.The former Vice President said some counties have used the little resources counties they get for development and to improve residents&rsquo; lives.He cited Wajir, Murang&rsquo;a and Turkana counties.&ldquo;Wajir has had the first tarmac road under devolution, while 32 maternity wings, including dispensaries, have been put in place. Murang&rsquo;a has started a cooperative society where farmers will be selling their milk. I believe each county has a positive story to tell,&rdquo; Kalonzo said.He said under the NASA government, revenue share to the counties would be increased from the current 15 per cent to 45 per cent.
