Counties in Western Kenya have been urged to exploit Lake Victoria’s tourism potential. Kenya Tourism Fund CEO Joseph Cherutoi said the lake is the world’s largest fresh water body, but the counties around it have underutilised it. He said it is absurd that the only economic activity around the lake is small-scale fishing. “There is a huge tourism potential for Lake Victoria and governors and leaders in counties around the lake should be innovative enough to come up with projects that will help this region grow economically,” Cherutoi said. He was speaking on Tuesday during the launch of the profiling and registration of hoteliers in Migori town. The exercise will be rolled out across the country to generate revenue to fund KTF’s activities. “We are currently only realising 50 per cent in our operations but we are optimistic that with this registration exercise, we will improve to about 80 per cent,” Cherutoi said.
