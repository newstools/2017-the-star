Students from technical institutes can now apply for higher education loans.This is contrary to what many people have been made to believe, where only university students qualify for the HELB loans. Education CS Fred Matiang&rsquo;i said the higher education board is receiving applications for the loans from students joining technical institutes.He spoke during the first graduation of Kenya Coast National Polytechnic, formerly the Mombasa Technical Training Institute. The CS said last year, funds budgeted by the HELB board for technical institute students was returned back to the ministry after they failed to apply for loans. Matiang&rsquo;i said Sh10.3 billion was set aside, but only Sh715 million was spent. This only benefited 22,000 students. He said the ministry will increase the amount to Sh14 billion this year.
