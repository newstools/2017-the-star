In the run-up to the last presidential election in the United States, Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton was so loathed by many, even within her own party, that some didn&rsquo;t bother to show up and vote while others opted to vote for Republican Donald Trump.This, in a nutshell, is why Clinton lost, and we now have someone who has converted the US presidency into something no different from the reality TV show he used to host.The question is, why was Clinton so hated or at least not favoured even by Democrats in her own party? The short answer is fatigue: A number of Americans were tired of the same old clans hogging power to the point they said &ldquo;enough is enough&rdquo;.This is also the reason why Jeb Bush, brother of former President George W Bush, couldn&rsquo;t gain traction in the Republican primaries, because many Americans could not take yet another Bush as President.Fatigue syndrome is something one must assume former Prime Minister Raila Odinga is or must be aware and have in place a strategy to counter it.Indeed, just the other day, when having lunch with someone from a neighbouring country, the friend noted that opposition chief Raila, like his Uganda counterpart Kizza Besigye, &ldquo;has vied for the presidency four times and lost each time.&rdquo;I corrected my friend, noting that Raila has stood for President thrice, won on two of the three occasions, but was not sworn in.That it&rsquo;s time for Raila to move on is not new. We hear it all the time, especially on social media. It is a misplaced notion.The reality is that one other than Raila can defeat President Uhuru Kenyatta and his state machine. No one.And therein lurks the danger if NASA were to make a mistake and give the ticket to someone else to be the joint flagbearer, that person will not only lose big time, but Jubilee may as well rule for another 50 years, as they arrogantly postulated following the last flawed elections.Why?This is because Jubilee will be emboldened to get rid of Deputy President William Ruto, and line up yet another one of their &ldquo;own&rdquo; to take over from President Uhuru in 2022 &mdash; a task which will be made much easier because Luos to a man will refuse to back whoever the opposition candidate would be, as payback for not nominating Raila.The converse is not true. Other tribes would not punish the opposition flagbearer in 2022 because NASA backed Raila in this election, simply because that would not make sense even among the politicians prone to peddling some of the dumbest things.For his part, Uhuru is already acting as though Ruto is irrelevant, and thus the effort to keep Baringo Senator Gideon Moi in the fold. Interestingly, Uhuru has managed to do what Raila failed to do in 2012 &mdash; to keep someone in the family, who otherwise was a stumbling block, outside the fold and that was none other than RutoThis writer dedicated hundreds of blogs and opeds pleading with Raila to woo Ruto back to the fold but was time and again resisted by several of his advisers, who in hindsight were extremely shortsighted and obviously dead wrong in their underestimating the damage Ruto would do.One such adviser point blank dismissed a strategy I proposed as &ldquo;too complicated&rdquo; to be implemented in Kenya when, in reality, it easily could have and allowed Ruto to remain with Raila.The point is, Raila cannot afford to make the same mistakes again. He should be hands on and be prepared to ignore some of the bad advice he will certainly get, while making sure there&rsquo;s a disciplined messenger to deliver the message home.He is the man and the country is doomed without him and, more importantly, without NASA rallying behind him, it is hello to continued domination by you-know-who.It&rsquo;s also how he beats back against those peddling the narrative that the opposition chief is fatigued.Samuel Omwenga is a legal expert and political commentator in the United States
