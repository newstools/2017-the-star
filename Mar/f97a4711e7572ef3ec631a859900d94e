Muhoroni MP Onyango Koyoo has hit out at his predecessor Ayiecho Olweny and Kisumu Senator Anyang Nyong&rsquo;o for failing to fight the privatisation of sugar firms.On Sunday, he said the two failed to fight for the welfare of farmers when the Privatisation Bill was presented in Parliament during the Grand Coalition government.Koyoo said Nyong&rsquo;o and Olweny should have mobilised MPs from the cane-growing region to shoot down the Privatisation Bill.He said, &ldquo;Nyong&rsquo;o was the minister for Medical Services and Ayiecho was the assistant minister for Education. What did they do to fight for our desperate farmers? They should stop pretending to now be concerned by the privatisation of the local sugar factory.&rdquo;Koyoo spoke after inspecting CDF projects.He said Nyong&rsquo;o and Olweny should apologise to residents for failing to address their problems.Koyoo said, &ldquo;Where were they when a huge chunk of land belonging to Miwani Sugar Factory was fraudulently sold in a nonexistent auction by affluent businessmen from the cane growing zones?&rdquo; Nyong&rsquo;o and Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo moved to court in April last year to block the privatisation of the Chemelil, Miwani, Muhoroni, Sony and Nzoia factories.
