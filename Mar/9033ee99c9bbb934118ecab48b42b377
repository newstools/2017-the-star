Nasa is set for a battle in Bungoma county after ANC accused Ford Kenya of spreading falsehoods about joint nominations.ANC county secretary Martin Wailula said Ford Kenya is using the information to deter its aspirants from running."It has come to our attention that Ford Kenya officials have been misleading our aspirants that only they will field candidates in the Nasa coalition after joint nominations," he said on Saturday.He termed the allegations as baseless, saying Ford Kenya has lost popularity on the ground and is only trying to use the Nasa flag to redeem itself."It is apparently becoming clear that Ford Kenya has lost its grip with majority of its MCAs in Bungoma joining ANC. It is against this backdrop that they are busy trying to scare our aspirants into joining them," he added.More on this: Mudavadi gains 'firm grip on Western' after Jubilee, ODM and Ford Kenya defectionsHe accused Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang'ula and deputy Boni Khalwale of initially fighting the Nasa arrangement, only to pretend to own it later on.He said ANC will field its own candidates and will not accept joint nominations in Bungoma.Wailula asked aspirants not to buy into propaganda by Ford Kenya officials and urged them to continue with their campaigns.He also expressed optimism that Nasa will pick Musalia Mudavadi as its presidential flagbearer as he was "the most accepted among all Kenyans".Read: Jubilee Party will beat NASA hands down, say Duale, Laboso and SudiAlso read: Raila declares vote-hunting war, says Nasa will raid more Jubilee zones"We are asking our brother Raila Odinga to do the honourable thing by supporting Mudavadi rather that push and lost to Jubilee," he said.He said since Mudavadi was Nasa's brainchild, he should be given the chance to lead the party.
