Jubilee Party has rejected former Mungiki leader Maina Njenga's nomination papers for the Laikipia senator seat.Njenga went to the party's headquarters to present the documents on Friday."The officers said they were acting under instructions from President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto. They said the two will call me," Njenga told the Star by phone.He added that he was confident he would win the nomination for the seat held by G.G. Kariuki.Njenga's brother Maina Njoroge told the Star that a man identified only as Limo declined to receive the papers."He was told that there were instructions from the party leadership not to accept them," said Njoroge. "We think we have been denied [the opportunity]."A source within the party said the papers were rejected because of integrity issues.Njenga said two weeks ago that he would take power by force if the party refused to give it to him.The former Mungiki leader made promises including ending the cattle rustling menace at Laikiapia-Baringo border, when he announced interest in the seat.He also said he will also conduct road shows to teach the public why it is important for communities to live together peacefully.More on this: Ex-Mungiki leader Maina Njenga bids for Laikipia senator seat, plans to end cattle theft
