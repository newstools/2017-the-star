Contractors of two roads at the centre of Jubilee campaigns in Bungoma have been rushing the projects ahead of President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s visit.Uhuru was scheduled to tour the region yesterday and today but postponed.The official reason: JP requested him to delay, to allow JP aspirants to verify their nomination documents.Party sources confided, however, the visit was rescheduled to allow contractors to finish the Musikoma-Mungatsi and Chwele-Lwakhaka roads.Political analyst Philip Wanyonyi yesterday told the Star it would be suicidal for the President to visit the region if at least 50 per cent of the roads are not complete.The contractor of the 55-kilometre Musikoma&ndash;Mungatsi road yesterday said they will cover five kilometres in the next one week.&ldquo;We acknowledge we had challenges during the initial stages,&rdquo; Omollo Billy, the engineer in charge of GAB constructions, said.He did not say whether the big rush was because of Uhuru&rsquo;&rdquo;s visit, only saying, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll complete the road in line with the contract, which gave us 30 months.&rdquo;The project was handed over to the contractor in April last year.A spot check by the Star revealed that tarmacking had reached Nambaya. Work is on day and night.The contractor of the 37-kilometre Chwele&ndash;Lwakhaka road has also in the past few days stepped up construction.The project manager of the China National Aerotechnology Company said they had finished doing the base and only tarmacking remains.He said they will not spend much time there as it would be very costly.&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to waste time. We&rsquo;ll ensure we finish the road even before the time of the contract elapses,&rdquo; the project manager said.
