The government has deployed 850 new Kenya Police Reservists in four counties of the North Rift affected by banditry.An additional Armoured Personnel Carrier has also been deployed in the area, increasing the number of APC&rsquo;s to three.The heavy deployment of security personnel will be sustained to ensure the August 8 elections are uninterrupted.&ldquo;We are happy with the deployment because it will restore peace, and ensure the campaigns will go on peacefully as in other parts of the country,&rdquo; Pokot South MP David Pkosing said.He has differed with some of the leaders in West Pokot county over the deployment of the KPRs to deal with the insecurity on the border of West Pokot, Turkana, Baringo and Elgeyo Marakwet counties, where more the officers have been deployed.Pkosing defended Deputy President William Ruto over claims he favoured some communities when he ordered the deployments.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not true that the KPR are from one community and were hired before training. Some people want to politicise this security issue for their personal gain,&rdquo; Pkosing said.The MP said the government has deployed the KPRs in all the counties that are experiencing insecurity in the North Rift region.&ldquo;The Jubilee government has the Pokot community needs at heart. This is contrary to the lies being peddled by certain leaders to create tension and mislead our people,&rdquo; he said.West Pokot Senator John Lonyangapuo had accused the DP of sidelining the Pokots in hiring the KPRs and in putting in place measures to end banditry in the region.&ldquo;We are in the government and we know what is going on. We are here to defend our people. It is therefore, wrong for some of the elected leaders to politicise security matters so that they make capital out of it,&rdquo; the MP said. The legislator said the government had deployed 250 new KPRs in Pokot, to add on 685 hired in the past and in all parts of the county. &ldquo;West Pokot deployment is the largest addition in the region. Marakwet has 242 KPRs, Turkana has 170 and Baringo 195. The KPRs are expected to work with their colleagues across county borders to stabilize security,&rdquo; he said.Elders from communities in the region led by former assistant minister Francis Mutwol have also backed government measures to deal with insecurity in the region.
