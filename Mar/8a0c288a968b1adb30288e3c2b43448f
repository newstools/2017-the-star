Nairobi has the most cases of child neglect and abandonment and children below the age of five years suffer the most, a survey by Childline Kenya indicates. It details a case of a three-year-old boy who was neglected by his siblings following the death of their parents. His siblings discovered he was HIV positive.The report says the boy used to survive on tea and mandazi because his siblings were not willing to cook for him. The child was rescued by Childline and was treated for severe malnutrition and tuberculosis. Sam, as identified by the report, later died. His siblings had refused to visit him in hospital.The study shows 75 per cent of child neglect was perpetrated by immediate family members followed by parents and extended family at 17 per cent and eight per cent. It also shows that more than 13,878 cases of child neglect and abandonment have been reported over the last 10 years. The survey says neglect and abandonment ar ethe root causes of all forms of child abuse. The implementation of the parenting programme has contributed to the reduction of the child neglect cases from 2014. &ldquo;The most reported forms of child neglect is in the form of prohibition from school, lack of medical attention and denial of food. As a result of these forms of abandonment, a child is left open to other forms of abuse,&rdquo; said Kidenda. Since 2006, Childline Kenya has been running a 24-hour National Child Helpline 116.
