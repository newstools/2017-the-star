Nairobi Jubilee governor aspirant Peter Kenneth has described Senator Mike Sonko as a foolish man known for &ldquo;epic hooliganism&rdquo; and gangster politics. &ldquo;We are not in the same league. We are different. I offer leadership, he offers hooliganism. I offer a way forward, he offers cheerleading to gangs. I went to school and perhaps some school went through him. But we should not score own goals. We should score goals on the other side,&rdquo; Kenneth said.He added, &ldquo;I told him [Sonko] that if we cannot have a consensus among the candidates who want the governorship on the Jubilee ticket, Jubilee is a very democratic party. We will go for nominations and we finish the matter once and for all because I am confident we will banish him from politics if we go that way, so it is up to him.&rdquo; Kenneth said people should stop assuming the differences between him and Sonko are an indication of strife within Jubilee.He spoke at Crowne Plaza Hotel during a meeting with the National Muslim Leaders&rsquo; Forum on Saturday.Kenneth said the incident in which Sonko and his supporters disrupted a football match in Dagoretti on Sunday last week demonstrates his &ldquo;foolish&rdquo; style of leadership.&ldquo;I offered my candidature to provide better options and I said I will put my CV on the table. I think it is very clear among us in Jubilee which candidate offers the best solutions and that is the candidate for Jubilee in Nairobi,&rdquo; he said.Kenneth added, &ldquo;A lot of times, we get provoked and people say, why don&rsquo;t you respond, why don&rsquo;t you react? And I keep on saying, if we react to foolish acts, people will not notice the difference. We will confuse the fraternity.&rdquo; He said he cannot retaliate by disrupting Sonko&rsquo;s events. Kenneth said he has no time to engage hooligans.He said incumbent Evans Kidero is his main competition. Kenneth accused Kidero of mismanaging the city.
