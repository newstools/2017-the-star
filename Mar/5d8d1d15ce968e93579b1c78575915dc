"He said he lived above a guitar shop in Birmingham but he's not originally from the Midlands and had a London accent,' the source said."But he said London wasn't like what it used to be."Police told us later it was definitely the Westminster attacker."It is understood Masood stayed at Preston Park last Friday night before checking out on Saturday morning, and then on Tuesday night after asking for a cheap room.The source added: "On both occasions he was asking for a cheaper rate. You would have thought if you were hellbent on committing a terror attack you&rsquo;d chuck it all on a credit card and forget the cost."He reportedly had a takeaway kebab on Tuesday night before checking out of the room on Wednesday. Speaking to MailOnline tonight, an employee of the hotel said: "The police have gone and there are guests staying in the hotel tonight. I don't know if the room he [Masood] stayed in [number 228] is closed. I can't comment on that."According to local reports, Brighton and Hove City Council planning officers had given their backing to close the hotel last year and convert it into flats.Bosses claimed the 34-bedroom hotel was running up unsustainable annual losses in excess of &pound;100,000 trying to compete with larger hotel chains.
