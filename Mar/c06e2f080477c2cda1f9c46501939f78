The Laikipia Peace Caravan has recruited morans to help in the fight against cattle rustling and acquisition of illegal weapons in Laikipia and Isiolo counties.The young men drawn from the Maasai and Samburu communities will preach peace and harmony for three months.Caravan chairman Mark Lereruk and his deputy Godfrey Putunoi on Sunday presided over the commissioning of the 24 peace ambassadors at Bishop Albino Mensa Pastoral Centre in Isiolo town.Lereruk said many morans engage in cattle rustling, and the best way to reach out to them is to get their own to preach peace.&ldquo;There is a need to engage them directly. They steal cattle, invade private property and engage in all manner of crimes,&rdquo; he said.Lereruk said a chairman has been appointed from each community to spearhead the campaign.The Laikipia-Isiolo border has been volatile for months, despite elders&rsquo; efforts to preach peace.Lereruk said elders have done their best, but it is wise to involve youths.He said some youths told the caravan young women fuel cattle rustling by singing war songs to morans as they raid private property. This motivates the youths.Some of the areas worst affected by cattle rustling include Sang&rsquo;a, Nandung&rsquo;olo, Ngare Ndare and Ilng&rsquo;wesi, where scores of people have been killed, others injured, cattle stolen and property destroyed.The peace ambassadors have urged partner Northern Rangelands Trust to avail a vehicle so they can traverse the county easily.
