President Uhuru Kenyatta on Wednesday will deliver a speech to Parliament in his last State of the Nation Address before the August poll.Speakers Justin Muturi (National Assembly) and Ekwee Ethuro (Senate) have notified their members on the planned special sitting through a gazette notice dated March 10.The sitting will be in the National Assembly chamber from 2pm. The speakers have allowed MPs to be accompanied by their spouses as long as they registered their names with the clerks by Thursday last week.The State of the Nation Address is an annual constitutional requirement. It obligates the President to address Kenyans on matters of national interest.&ldquo;The President shall, once every year, report, in an Address to the Nation, on all the measures taken and the progress achieved in the realisation of the Constitutional values,&rdquo; the Supreme Law reads.The President is also to publish in the Kenya Gazette details of the measures taken and submit a report for debate in the National Assembly on the progress in fulfilling international obligations.The Constitution gives the President the discretion to address MPs at any time that he deems appropriate.This year&rsquo;s address comes barely five months to the August 8 election, amid heightening political temperatures as politicians intensify campaigns.On March 31 last year, Uhuru&rsquo;s State of the Nation Address was disrupted by whistle-blowing opposition MPs.
