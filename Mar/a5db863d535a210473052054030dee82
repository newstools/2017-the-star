Senators yesterday passed the Division of Revenue Bill after increasing allocation to counties to Sh352.8 billion contrary to what the National Assembly had given the devolved units.The National Assembly two weeks ago allocated ShSh323.8 billion for the 2017-18 financial year and the resolution of the senators is likely to set the stage for a clash between the two Houses.The Senate Finance committee chaired by Mandera Senator Billow Kerrow (pictured) in a report tabled in the House increased county equitable share allocation to Sh314 billion from the Sh291 billion passed by the National Assembly.The committee further recommended that the Senate adopt a conditional allocation of Sh38 billion, including allocations from loans and grants amounting to Sh5.5 billion.It seems to have agreed with proposals by Commission on Revenue Commission and the Council of Governors, which last week pleaded they be adopted.Now that the Senate passed the Bill with amendments, it will be reverted to the National Assembly for consideration. If members concur, it will be adopted and forwarded to the Present to sign it into law.If they disagree with the changes, the Bill will be subjected to mediation.
