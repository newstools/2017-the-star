The threat to sack striking doctors has become a reality as governors yesterday started issuing dismissal letters.This came as it emerged the counties are already seeking the services of medics from Tanzania and Cuba to bridge the gap left by the striking workers.A day after the county and national governments said they were withdrawing out the offer made to the doctors, the Council of Governors insisted they will pay only those who will resume duty. Chairman Peter Munya said intern doctors have been directed to resume duties as the government has been paying for their education.&ldquo;The doctors dismissed from duty as from today will not enjoy the benefits. The strike has been illegal, but those who have already resumed work will be paid their allowances and backdated to January,&rdquo; he said.Munya said those sacked could be reemployed but in line with specific county guidelines under new terms and conditions. He denied claims that the government will deregister the doctors&rsquo; union, saying it has no mandate.Addressing delegates during the ongoing Fourth Devolution Conference in Naivasha, the Meru governor said the doctors were given a far much better offer but refused to go back to work, leaving them with no option other than firing them.&ldquo;Employers, too, have a right and you cannot hold them to ransom because Kenyans have the right to healthcare that the doctors are denying them,&rdquo; Munya said.
