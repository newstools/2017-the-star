The world's first 'smart condom' which rates a man's sexual performances and can detect STIs has been created by scientists.The i-Con Smart Condom is billed as the newest form of wearable technology in the ever-growing market.Providing a range of statistics, including duration, speed and girth measurements, male users are able to assess their sexual prowess. The device also records the amount of calories burnt, different positions and can detect chlamydia and syphilis. All information will be kept anonymous - but users 'will have the option to share their recent data with friends, or, indeed the world'.In a similar way to other health monitoring devices, it will use nano-chip and bluetooth technology to relay the data to a smartphone app.Over 90,000 people have already pre-ordered the product which will be released later this year at the price of &pound;59.99.The ring - which comes with a one year warranty - is worn at the base of the condom, is adjustable for size, and can be worn multiple times.It has an integrated micro USB port so it can be recharged, with each charge lasting about six to eight hours.British Condoms, which has been delivering condoms and other products since 1999, revealed last year that it was developing the unique product.Adam Leverson, lead engineer on the i.Con project said: 'Not only have we innovated the world's first smart condom ring - that'll measure pretty much every aspect of performance in the bedroom - but now I'm pleased to confirm that it will also have built-in indicators to alert the users to any potential STIs present.'Aaron Slater, spokesperson for Nottingham-based British Condoms, added: 'We knew we were on the cusp of creating something special with i.Con, and bringing a new meaning to "wearable tech".'But being advocates of safe sex, we wanted something more, and the addition of an STI indicator has certainly done that.'With over 96,000 pre-registrations for the product, we know that this is a complete game-changer.'The i.Con is currently in final stages of testing before its release later this year.Those who pre-register will receive updates and be offered the chance to buy before the product gets launched to the general public.
