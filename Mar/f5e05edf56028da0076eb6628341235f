Five Vihiga MCAs have told Wiper secretary general and Mombasa Senator Omar Hassan to stop threatening the opposition on nominations.They are Ben Ombima, Vincent Athiaya, Maureen Ambasa, Wilberforce Kitiezo and Tom Atingo. Yesterday, they urged Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka to come clean on whether the party will remain in NASA or will go it alone.At the weekend, Omar said the party will leave NASA if it is forced to participate in joint nominations.He said joint nominations are similar to party dissolution, adding, &ldquo;Wiper has not ratified any decision to hold joint nominations.&rdquo;Analysts have said separate primaries would be dangerous for NASA and the safest route would be joint nominations to avoid splitting opposition support.
