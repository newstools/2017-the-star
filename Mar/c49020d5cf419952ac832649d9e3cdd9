Kenyatta University has emerged winners in the national chapter of the Global Management Challenge. Team Yeshuas will represent Kenya at the GMC International finals to be held in Doha, Qatar in April. &ldquo;This is the third time we are holding the competition in Kenya, and we are seeing the level of interest from competitors and potential businesses partners continue to grow,&rdquo; co-founder of the local GMC chapter Asim Shah said. The competition is aimed at offering alternative business leadership platforms outside the classroom or the rigid corporate structure. &ldquo;Businesses get the opportunity to support and closely mentor high potential men and women, contributing to the development of the local human resource talent pool,&rdquo; Shah said. Other teams that performed well at the national finals include the team from Profiles International who were runners up, Militarium from the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture &amp; Technology who took third place, and the management team from Antarc Furniture in fourth place.
