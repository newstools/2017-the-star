AFC Leopards have gone about their business this season in truly, Leopards fashion not attracting attention to themselves until the mauling they dished out on supermarket chain store giants Nakumatt a fortnight ago.That resounding 3-0 victory made all and sundry stand up and notice. Not that Leopards will mind being in the spotlight for the right reasons. No! Today, Stewart Hall&rsquo;s charges get another opportunity to lay down another marker in the SportPesa Premier League when they take on high-flying new boys Nzoia Sugar.In their two matches since there return to the top flight league, Bernard Mwalala&rsquo;s men have churned two remarkable results against former champions not least the opening day walloping of holders Tusker.The element of surprise they had then has disappeared but Nzoia still pack a dangerous punch that Ingwe should be wary of.Misery loves company and they seem to have found a good one in Muhoroni Youth.No sooner had they freed themselves from the yoke of relegation, brought on their neck by the federation&rsquo;s strict club licencing rules, than they were slapped with a huge bill by the Sports Disputes Tribunal for breaching the contracts of three of their former players. Today, as they prepare to face Bandari, another disciplinary action emanating from their abandoned tie against Kakamega Homeboyz awaits them.The tie was handed to Homeboyz on a 2-0 basis.New-comers Kericho Zoo meet Nakumatt tomorrow in their third match at Kericho Green stadium.Zoo lost two of their opening matches to both Posta Rangers and Gor Mahia and are optimistic of registering a first win against visiting Nakumatt.Zoo manager Ibrahim Muganda welcomed the approval of Kericho Green Stadium by security committee which had hindered the home team from playing their opening match against Posta, switching the encounter to Afraha Stadium, Nakuru where they were beaten 1-0.The team went on to lose to Gor Mahia in a 1-0 scoreline at Moi Stadium, Kisumu in the second match.
