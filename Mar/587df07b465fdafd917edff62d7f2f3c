Manager Eddie Howe focused his Bournemouth training sessions on improving their defence this week as they face free-scoring Manchester United striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic in the Premier League today.Bournemouth have conceded 51 goals, the second highest in the league, and have lost their last four matches. They are in danger of being dragged into the relegation battle, with just four points separating them from the bottom three.&ldquo;My focus was on keeping a clean sheet. We have done a lot of work on defending in training,&rdquo; Howe said yesterday.&ldquo;We&rsquo;re a better attacking team than defending at the moment so we need to close those margins. We&rsquo;re working hard.&rdquo;Ibrahimovic has been in fine form this season and inspired United to victory over Southampton with a brace in Sunday&rsquo;s League Cup final to take his goal tally to 26 this season.&ldquo;I was impressed with Ibrahimovic when we came up against him back in August. We have to be prepared,&rdquo; added Howe, whose team were beaten 3-1 at home by United in their first game of the season.Howe is sure 14th-placed Bournemouth will soon register their first league win of the year.&ldquo;We&rsquo;re as confident as we can be with this run of fixtures. We know that a win is needed to fully feel good about ourselves, hopefully (a win is) not too far away,&rdquo; Howe said.Meanwhile, United midfielder Michael Carrick hinted he could call time on his career if the club do not offer him a new contract for the next season.Carrick, who is out of contract at the end of the campaign, has been reduced to a bit-part role in United&rsquo;s squad under manager Jose Mourinho, having made just 11 Premier League appearances so far.&ldquo;(Retirement) almost depends on how long I&rsquo;m here. I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s many places I&rsquo;d want to play, if any, after this anyway. I probably would say yes - that would be it if I left in the summer,&rdquo; said Carrick.The 35-year-old Carrick, who was awarded a June 4 testimonial by United on Thursday, has spent 11 years at the club, winning 16 major trophies, including five league titles.&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t really had that much of a conversation with him (Mourinho) at the moment. Obviously that will happen pretty soon. That&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;m really relaxed about. I&rsquo;m sure he is as well,&rdquo; Carrick added.&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had such a time here, that I don&rsquo;t think (I would go elsewhere). I feel really good, to be honest. You&rsquo;ve just got to judge how you go. It can change quite quickly. I feel fine.&rdquo;
