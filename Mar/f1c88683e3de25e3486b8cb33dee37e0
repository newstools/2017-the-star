Influence over the two largest of the Samburu&rsquo;s nine clans, ability to mobilise financial resources and newly registered voters will determine the next governor of Samburu on August 8.The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission had registered more than 22,000 voters by the end of last mass voter registration in addition to 61,114 who had registered ahead of the 2013 general election.Political analysts say incumbent Governor Moses Lenolkulal, who is defending his seat on the Jubilee Party ticket, will have a hard time convincing the electorate to reelect him, due to accusations that he has neglected some clans during hiring.Analysts argue the Samburus have not fully embraced the Jubilee Party due to the approach with which the herders-ranch owners conflict in Laikipia county is being handled.However, the majority of the Samburu political aspirants, apart from those seeking election on the ODM ticket are campaigning for President Uhuru Kenyatta's reelection.Others argue that as it happened in 2013, money to run a well-oiled campaign will determine the winner in the August 8 poll.President Uhuru's TNA was initially the party of choice in the county in the last general election, but many of its candidates ended up losing those of William Ruto&rsquo;s URP.Opposition leader Raila Odinga also enjoyed considerable support in the county.This delicate situation could repeat itself with parties such as Baringo Senator Gideon Moi's Kanu fronting a governor candidate, MP aspirants and MCAs.Kanu enjoys huge support in the county, with many aspirants showing their interest to seek elective posts on the party&rsquo;s ticket, including woman representative Maison Leshoomo.Tribalism and clan loyalty are also likely expected to influence the outcome of the elections.The two frontrunners in the governor race &mdash; the incumbent and former Teachers Service Commission chief executive officer Gabriel Lengoiboni &mdash; come from the Lmasula, the largest of the Samburu&rsquo;s nine clans.Whoever between Lenolkulal and Lengoibon gets the support of the Lorukush, the second largest clan will have an upper hand in becoming the next governor.Former Samburu West MP Simon Lesirma has also expressed his interest to stand for the top county job on the ODM ticket.Lengoibon is largely seen as a manager and not a politician, with those close to him saying he is being pushed to join politics.But his agenda and vision for the people of Samburu is based on education, insecurity and food security.Despite being from the largest clan, and enjoying a lot of support across the county, Lengoibon's challenge is limited financial resources, which might derail his governor bid. He doesn't have a lot of cash to run an intensive campaign.Lesirma has not campaigned actively and the only time he appeared in public and declared his interest was when he accompanied ODM leader Raila Odinga to Baragoi and Maralal town.During the tour, Raila said that Lesirma was his preferred candidate for governor.Unlike in the past elections, development record and integrity are also expected to influence the choice of the next county boss.Lenolkulal&rsquo;s government has been accused of abuse of office, flouting the Public Procurement Act, questionable procurement of vehicles and authorisation of the renovation of Wamba Stadium.A section of MCAs have also accused the governor of unhealthy reshuffles of county executives, which affects continuity in administration.Governor Lenolkulal says he has completed 500 projects, on which basis he is seeking a reelection.In the health sector, he says he has modernised the Samburu District Hospital, which is now a referral facility complete with a renal unit. He says he has built enough dams complete with submersible water pumps as a way of curbing water shortage. He has also given plastic water tanks to all public schools.In the education sector, Lenolkulal says he has built ECDE classrooms in every ward across the county, and employed teachers on permanent basis.In agriculture, he has bought tractors to promote mechanisation, ease tillage and enhance food production.He pened up open air markets, tarmacked and installed floodlights in Maralal town.In the Senate race, Samburu assembly speaker Steve Lelegwe will battle it out with incumbent Sammy Leshore.Lelegwe, a young turk who is banking his support on the youth, is a political greenhorn, while Leshore is seen as an elder whose advice in the Samburu leadership is still needed.Woman representative Maison Leshomo will defend her seat on the Kanu ticket.She will face ODM's Pauline Lenguris and Jubilee's Rebbeca Lengupae.Nominated Senator Naisula Lesuuda wants to succeed Lati Lelelit as Samburu West MP on the Kanu ticket.Lelelit is said to be under pressure to vie for governor but he maintains he is yet to finish the projects he started for the Samburu West constituents.Opinion leaders, including activist John Lenkulate, argue that although people in 2013 considered money, party wave and tribalism, people are now wiser and will go for leadership qualities.
