The late Olympic marathon champion Samuel Wanjiru had a strained relationship with his wife days before he was found dead, his mother now says.Hannah Wanjiru told an inquest into the death that Triza Njeri had given her son outrageous demands, including a Sh100,000 monthly maintenance fee.She told chief magistrate Francis Andanyi that her son would hear none of it. &ldquo;He said he couldn&rsquo;t pay Njeri Sh100,000 every month because she was his wife and other men do not pay their wives,&rdquo; she said.Hannah on Monday said Njeri also asked Wanjiru to change her national identity card and acknowledge her as his only legal wife.She had demanded the athlete leave his second wife Mary Wachera and kick her out of a house he bought for her. The conditions were made to have her drop a gun charge case she had lodged against him in court.&ldquo;The two were fighting because Njeri was not happy that Wanjiru had married a second wife. It is that time that she took him to court, saying he had threatened her with a gun&rdquo; Hannah said.Wanjiru died on May 15, 2011. No one was directly linked to his death, necessitating the inquest. Police said he fell from his balcony.The multi-millionaire athlete was arrested and charged in December 2010 after his wife told police he threatened to kill her using a gun believed to have been acquired illegally.The case was later withdrawn.Hannah said her daughter-in-law left their matrimonial home in February and was living in Ngong in a house bought by the marathoner.Three days to his mysterious death, Njeri came back allegedly to pick up her children&rsquo;s birth certificates, the court heard. Hannah said six men were caught on CCTV cameras on the fateful night and were let in by the watchman just a few minutes after Njeri had arrived.She produced Njeri&rsquo;s ID card that had the names Triza Njeri Kamau, but said her original ID read Triza Njeri Muturi.Njeri is expected to give her side of the story when the case resumes.
