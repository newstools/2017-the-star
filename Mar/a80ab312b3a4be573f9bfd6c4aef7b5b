The ever-green Jackline Mwangi scored a hat-trick as champions Orange Telkom humiliated United States International University-Africa 10-0 during the Kenya Hockey Union (KHU) women’s Premier League match yesterday at the City Park Stadium. In a one-sided clash, on-form Irene Okumu, Barbara Simiyu and Caroline Guchu added a brace each as captain Betsy Omalla sounded the boards once. This was the second win for the 18-time local and Africa champions, having defeated Chase Amira 3-0 in their league opener two weeks ago. Under the watchful eyes of Josephine Ataro, Simiyu scored for the champions barely two minutes into play through before speedy Okumu opened her scoring account in the 13the minute through a field goal. Omalla, who was away for the better part of last season due to personal reasons, was next on target in the 26th minute as Orange dominated the proceedings. Guchu then scored the fourth goal three minutes later and returned with goal number five in the 32nd minute heading into the break. On resumption, the script was not any different as barely nine minutes into play, Okumu scored her second goal in the 44th minute to put Telkom 6-0 ahead before Mwangi scored in the 51st minute to ensure her name was on score-sheet. Mwangi returned to inflict more pain on the students two minutes later with Simiyu adding then ninth goal in the 54th minute. Mwangi completed her hat-trick in the 63rd minute to seal a 10-0 win for Orange. Coach Ataro lauded the team’s performance and remained optimistic of a good season. “I am happy with the three points. This time, we made use of the many scoring chances that came our way unlike our first match against the bankers. We hope to built on this result going forward,” said the former national team goalkeeper.
