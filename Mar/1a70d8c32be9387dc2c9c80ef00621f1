The murder of Dr David Chege has similarities with that of lawyer Willie Kimani, who was killed mid-last year alongside a client and a taxi driver.Both Dr Chege and lawyer Kimani were pursuing justice when they were killed. And there is considerable circumstantial evidence they were killed by Administration Police officers.Chege went to the AP camp at Kianyago, where his son had vanished while in police custody, only for him to disappear too &ndash; and then turn up dead.Kimani, his client and taxi man, were killed by AP officers and their bodies thrown into the Ol Donyo Sabuk River.It is one thing to kill alleged criminals, but quite another to kill the parents of the suspects when they go looking for their missing children.The Independent Police Oversight Authority should investigate Dr Chege&rsquo;s killing and get to the bottom of the matter. At this rate, being taken into AP custody, whether one is innocent or guilty, is a chilling prospect.
