Some Kwale ODM leaders want a mlolongo (queue) voting system used in the April 11 party nominations.They said the secret-ballot method has loopholes that can be used by some hopefuls to rig out their rivals.They call themselves Team Kwale.Matuga MP Hassan Mwanyoha on Friday led the team in the Jogo Grounds, Gombato.He said some hopefuls are preferred by top ODM leaders from Mombasa, and they can unfairly clinch the tickets if the ballot system is used.He did not name the Mombasa leaders.Former Msambweni MP Omar Zonga, an aspiring Lungalunga MP, said the secret ballot method can easily be used to manipulate the outcome.He said boxes will be carried from Mombasa stuffed with already marked ballot papers in favour of preferred candidates.&ldquo;Stand with us and don&rsquo;t allow the secret ballot. The mlolongo system will give us the candidate preferred by the electorate,&rdquo; Zonga said.&ldquo;We know that ODM National Election Board chairperson Judy Pareno has declared that voting will be through the ballot, but we want to tell her to treat Kwale as a special case and allow mlolongo as other counties use ballot voting.&rdquo;The sentiments were shared by nominated MP Zuleikha Hassan, a woman representative hopeful, and Gombato Bongwe MCA Omar Boga, who added they are in ODM because they respect its leader Raila Odinga.&ldquo;Otherwise, we could have ditched the party a long time ago,&rdquo; he said.
