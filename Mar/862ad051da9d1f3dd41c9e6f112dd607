School lessons were unexpectedly interrupted when one of the
stars of the hit TV series Tahidi High paid a surprise visit to Melon Mission
in Nakuru. Geoffrey Githea, who plays the role of Teacher Karimi in the
popular Citizen TV programme, spent almost the entire morning at Melon Mission,
a non-governmental haven for over 450 destitute
children. During his visit, Githea gave pupils a
series of inspirational talks, stressing the need to get a good education,
learning English for skills in business and to stay away from the dangers of
alcohol and drugs. “I was certainly impressed with the set up
at Melon Mission and its very well behaved pupils”, said Githea. “These hard working boys and girls are an
important part of our future, and at Melon Mission they have created a caring
and very positive environment for these young people who have not had the
easiest start in life, to say the least.  Melon Mission set an excellent
example in education that we Kenyans should be proud of”, he added. Githea’s appearance at the school, which
was greeted with initial shock then huge enthusiasm by the pupils, came about after
a meeting with a volunteer from the UK-based Younique Travel Adventures, which
supports Melon Mission. “It was a memorable day for the school, a
wonderful treat for our pupils and for our staff.  Geoffrey Githea is a
tremendous role model.  He spoke from the heart, inspiring our children to
place a very high value on their education.  We are extremely grateful to
him and also Younique Travel Adventures for their tireless support”, commented James
Kagema, Executive Director of Melon Mission.
