The presence of playmaker Evans Kiwanuka in the Western Stima attack will go a long way to plug the attacking role left by the reigning SportPesa Premier League Player of the year Kenneth Muguna, coach Henry Omino has pledged.Kiwanuka, brought in from Ushuru, will have big boots to fill if Stima are to replicate last year&rsquo;s form that saw them remain outsiders for the league title until the last couple of months when their challenge fizzled out.&ldquo;Kiwanuka is progressing well with the new demands placed on him and we are confident he will go a long way to take up Muguna&rsquo;s role. He is a player, who is comfortable on the ball and is always ready to learn and those are good characteristics of a footballer,&rdquo; remarked Omino.The wily tactician also pointed out the fact that Fred Shimonyo has stuck with the club and that he will be pivotal to their ambition of finishing better than the sixth placed finish they managed last season.&ldquo;Shimonyo will be equally important more than he was last year to help our new players settle in and his experience will be vital to our goals,&rdquo; added Omino.The soft-spoken coach also took time to empathise with his left back Wesley Onguso, who was left distraught after clashing with a Hull City player during their friendly with the SportPesa All Stars on Monday.&ldquo;Everybody could see how Onguso was affected and we can only sympathise with him because it goes to show he was concerned about the welfare of an opponent. We are glad that his experience out there will continue to help in his development and we look forward to having him back after in the week,&rdquo; offered Omino.The Stima boss voiced his frustrations at the continued delay in the start of the league over disagreements between the league mangers and the federation, pointing out that it has left him needing to organize friendlies in order to keep his players sharp and focused. This weekend, they will play Zoo Kericho.Apart from Kiwanuka, Stima also brought in experienced trio of Moses Arita (Muhoroni Youth), Jackson Saleh (Gor), Ezekiel Otuoma (Ulinzi) as well as Dan Omondi (Timsales), Maurice Ojwang (Bondo United), Gad Mathews (Palos FC), George Odhiambo (Nairobi Stima), Stephen Odhiambo (Posta Rangers), Mohamed Mulisya (Chemelil), John Oruko (Julu Nyabangu), Samwel Odhiambo (Chemelil Sugar), Wycliffe Abuga (Muhoroni Youth) and the duo of Salim Odeka and Jeconia Ogendo from Agro Chemical.
