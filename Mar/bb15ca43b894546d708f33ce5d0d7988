Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero&rsquo;s hopes to use the Senate to intervene in a disputed 3,000 acres worth Sh61 billion were dashed yesterday.The Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights declined to hear the petition.In a report, it said the matter is pending in court. The committee, chaired by Busia Senator and former Attorney General Amos Wako, however, said there is a need to quickly have legislation to provide for alternative dispute resolution mechanism between the national and county governments.&ldquo;The committee, therefore, recommends a review of the law and the formulation of legislation to address this gap,&rdquo; the report reads. Kidero (pictured) said the now-defunct Nairobi City Council bought the Embakasi land from Kayole Estates Ltd in 1997 and shortly after, the Department of Defence applied to be allocated 988 acres. He said the application was considered and approved by the council on condition that DoD would pay a standard premium of Sh40 million within 30 days of allotment. The matter has been pending in the High Court since 2012.It is, however, not clear how the Senate cleared the petition to be committed to the committee as the Standing Orders stipulates that when a matter is pending before a court of law it should not be heard. Nairobi may have lied to the Senate by stating that the matter was not in court. The committee observed that the Ministry of Defence, in its objection, indicated it was not keen in participating in any alternative dispute resolution as proposed by Kidero in the petition.
