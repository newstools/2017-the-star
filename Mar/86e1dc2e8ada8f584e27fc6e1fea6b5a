All public secondary schools in Nairobi will soon have free Wi-Fi.Governor Evans Kidero yesterday said the county government has set aside Sh100 million in 2017-18 for the project.&ldquo;We are going to bridge the electronic divide between private and public schools in the county and make sure computers are useful. This can only be achieved by providing connectivity to all public secondary schools in Nairobi,&rdquo; he said. Kidero said the county government had partnered with two international firms &ndash; Bridge the Gap and Computers for Schools Kenya &ndash; to avail 2,000 computers. The partnership with Bridge the Gap will ensure each of the 85 schools get at least 20 computers as soon as the project is rolled out in July. This, he said, would help boost e-learning.Kidero spoke at Marura Primary School in Kariobangi. Last week, Bridge the Gap donated 20 desktop computers to Ushirika Secondary School in Kariobangi valued at Sh1.2 million. Mathare Secondary School has also benefited from the programme.
