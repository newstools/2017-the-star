Chelsea manager Antonio Conte has earmarked Arsenal star Alexis Sanchez as one of his summer transfer targets - but the Gunners have resolved to sell their wantaway forward to a foreign club.The Italian, who looks set to lead the Blues to the Premier League title in his debut season in English football, has already discussed summer transfers with the Stamford Bridge hierarchy.Among the players Conte would like to sign is Chilean international Sanchez, 28, who looks very likely to leave Arsenal after three seasons with the club.However, Chelsea are well aware that Arsenal will be extremely reluctant to sell Sanchez to another Premier League club, let alone a fierce London rival.This seems to be the conclusion reached by Chelsea director Marina Granovskaia and technical director Michael Emenalo, who have heard Conte&rsquo;s squad-strengthening intentions.Sanchez&rsquo;s agent, Fernando Felicevich, is understood to be aware of Chelsea&rsquo;s interest but there hasn&rsquo;t yet been a bid from the league leaders.The Chilean, whose contract at the Emirates Stadium has 15 months to run, is demanding an increase in salary from his current &pound;130,000-a-week to something in the region &pound;250,000 (Sh31m)-a-week.That would place him within the wage structure of only Europe&rsquo;s elite clubs, with Paris Saint-Germain, Juventus and Inter Milan touted as potential destinations if Arsenal sell him.Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has stated that contract talks with Sanchez are on hold until the end of the season, which his future in north London largely dependent on whether they qualify for the Champions League.If they decide to let him leave, it is highly unlikely that Sanchez will cross the London divide, and he will return to the continent.Inter&rsquo;s new Chinese owners, Suning, are keen to make a statement in the transfer market in an effort to challenge Italian champions-elect Juventus and Sanchez would fit the bill.
