A parliamentary joint committee retreats today to draft a report on the striking doctors&rsquo; disputed 2013 CBA.The walkout in its 95th day today has disrupted and stalled services in public hospitals. The National Assembly&rsquo;s Labour and Health committees will meet in Mombasa to consider submissions by former Public Health and Sanitation PS Mark Bor, doctors&rsquo; union officials, the Council of Governors, the Health ministry, Salaries and Remuneration Commission and the Public Service Commission.Health Committee chairman Robert Pukose (Endebess) yesterday said the recent turn of events to unlock the impasse facing the health sector cannot stop them from mediating and making recommendations to resolve the strike.Speaking in Naivasha, President Uhuru Kenyatta and Council of Governors chairman Peter Munya (pictured) on Tuesday ordered all medics to return to working, or be sacked. They announced withdrawal of the Sh600 million doctors&rsquo; risk allowance offer to be backdated to July last year. &ldquo;What has happened in court and sentiments from the President and CoG does not interfere with our work as a committee,&rdquo; Pukose said.
