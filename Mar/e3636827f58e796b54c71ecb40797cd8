I'm very grateful and call for your support," she said.The legislator urged residents to vote for her.Mbarire said that despite the village residents always voting for Wambora in her 10 years as MP in the area, she has never neglected the area and still fund projects in the village.She said she is sure of winning the governor seat and asked the Wambora backyard to join other county residents in electing her.Mbarire said she supported Wambora in the March 4, 2013, general election, but he has not fulfilled his pre-election pledges and helped achieved residents dreams for a developed county.She said she will develop the whole county when elected.The lawmaker added that she has done a lot with the Sh80 million that her CDF receives annually, compared to what Wambora has done, yet he has received more than Sh17 billion allocation in four years.Mbarire said she had constructed schools in the village despite their opposition to her, initiated water and many other projects.She said governor's office requires a go-getter career politician like her, dismissing her opponents as persons seeking retirement shelter from other jobs.Mbarire said none of the other aspirants can match her experience as a seasoned politician, arguing that she can go anywhere to seek resources for Embu people without fear.Senator Lenny Kivuti also wants to run for governor.
