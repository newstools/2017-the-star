Embu Governor Martin Wambora would retain his seat if elections were held today.A survey conducted by Trends and Insights for Africa shows Wambora is the most preferred governor candidate with 48 per cent.In the survey conducted between February 16 and 18, some 400 registered voters were interviewed with a margin error of +/- 2 per cent and 95 per cent degree of confidence.The interviews were conducted face to face with respondents sampled from households.The poll shows 19 per cent of the respondents prefer Senator Lenny Kivuti as governor and 13 per cent support Cecile Mbarire.Though fout per cent of the respondents are undecided on whom to vote for, another 11 per cent want Kithinji Kiragu, three per cent want Leonard Njeru and one per cent prefer Cyrus Njiru.The survey shows although the incumbent senator Kivuti is running for governor, 35 per cent of the respondents prefer him as senator, with 29 per cent yet to make up their minds.Another nine per cent would vote for Joshua Kanake, four per cent for Pitts Mugambi, while Geoffrey Kiringa and Leonard Muriuki, each have two and one per cent respectively.The survey indicates 38 per cent of the respondents prefer incumbent Rose Mitaru as women representative.Dorothy Nditi was second with 10 per cent followed by Susan Nyaga at nine per cent. Thirty-seven per cent of the respondents are yet to decide.The ruling Jubilee Party enjoys popular support at 81 per cent, followed by NASA at five.Another two per cent are not affiliated to any party compared to 12 per cent who support other parties apart from Jubilee and NASA.The Jubilee Party and any other political outfit supporting the reelection of President Uhuru Kenyatta, ethnicity, financial muscle and the number of registered voters will determine the next Embu governor. In 2013, the county had 227,286 registered voters and by the end of the last mass voter registration ahead of August polls more than 61,587 more enrolled. Political analysts say the candidate who will clinch the Jubilee Party nomination will have the highest chance of winning the seat because he or she will associate with Uhuru and the dominant party.However, as happened in the last general election, money to run a well-oiled campaign will determine the Jubilee candidate and the overall winner on August 8.Analysts say although Uhuru&rsquo;s TNA was the party of choice in 2013, many candidates lost to APK because they had the financial muscle to reach, influence and mobilise voters.
