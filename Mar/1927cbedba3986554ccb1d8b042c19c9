The still-simmering issue of whether the doctors should be paid for the 100 days they went on strike highlights a uniquely Kenyan situation that should be resolved once and for all.All over the rest of the world, the principle of going on strike is you do not expect to be paid for the time you do not work.However, in the case of the doctors&rsquo; strike, the return-to-work formula held the medics be paid for the days they stayed away from work. Both sides signed the formula and government simply must pay.But Kenyans have to break this cycle of going on strike and still being paid. This is the crux of the matter when it comes to why there are virtually no strikes in the private sector but the public sector is beset by industrial action annually &ndash; teachers, college lecturers, nurses, etc.An official announcement should be made that there will henceforth be no pay to be on strike.
