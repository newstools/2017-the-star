A magistrate in Shanzu, Mombasa county, has threatened to dismiss a case against the widow of slain Muslim cleric Aboud Rogo and three others as the prosecution has not presented evidence in court concerning terror charges.Rogo&rsquo;s widow Haniya Sagar (pictured), Zamzam Abdi and sisters Luul Ali and Nasteho Ali were charged with aiding terror activities and failing to give information which would have stopped the commissioning of a terror attack.They are accused of aiding three slain terrorists to attack the Central police station in September last year.The attack was said to have been led by Tasnim Yakub, who allegedly received funding from Sagar.Shanzu resident magistrate Diana Mochache said she was giving the prosecution the last chance to present evidence before the court or discharge the accused. She said the prosecution, led by state counsel Daniel Wamotsa, should present the remaining eight witnesses in the next hearing.Wamotsa had asked the court to adjourn the matter after the intended witnesses failed to appear before the court.He said the witnesses had promised to turn up and testify, but they did not.Mochache said it was unfair to the accused for the matter to continue dragging on as they have been in custody after the prosecution appealed her decision to release them on bond.Last week, the High Court stopped Mochache&rsquo;s decision to release Sagar and the other three but gave the prosecution 30 days to file an application at the Court of Appeal.
