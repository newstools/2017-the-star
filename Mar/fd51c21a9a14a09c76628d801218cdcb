Wilson Lokoruka looks up to the clear sky momentarily before calling out for the weak and emaciated women to come to a grass-thatched makeshift house.Being an assistant chief for Ngilukia, Turkana county, he commands a lot of respect. The community relies on him to fight the dreaded bandits from the Pokot community, whenever they get wind of a looming raid.&ldquo;I'm also the doctor since this area has been marginalised for a long time,&rdquo; he says, telling residents that God will stand with them, despite all the problems they are facing.Marginalised, insecure Lokoruka represents Sukuta, the valley of death where several policemen have been killed by bandits in the recent past. He carries with him all the hopes and aspirations of the society.For him, it is difficult for one to understand what marginalisation means without having experienced it.Turkana remains a vast plain of sand and stones, interspersed with mountains of various sizes and heights, with poor road networks, if any, and scattered houses.The mountains provide the best manoeuvring terrain for the dreaded bandits, who hit when least expected.No sooner had the women noticed three lorries belonging to the Kenya Red Cross Society than they momentarily forgot their problems.They immediately burst into song and dance, praising God, who even they believe denied them rain but had now provided them with food.The women, clad in their traditional regalia, praised the Society for coming to their rescue during their hour of need, their faces filled with resilience and hope.The Red Cross on February 21 provided the more than one thousand residents with relief food.Lokoruka said businesses have been cut off as those who tried their hand at it have given up due to insecurity.The journey from Kapedo to Ngilukia at first seemed a walk in the park until when reality sank in that Pokots in the area are heavily armed and cannot allow any other ordinary vehicle to pass through their territory.Amazingly, word spread as fast as wild fire that two vehicles belonging to the Kenya Red Cross Society will snake their way through the area in a short while.No roads Road networks from Nguyinga junction towards Kapedo are almost non-existent. In Kasarani, for instance, the driver has to use his or her driving experience to navigate.There are basically no roads. The driver has to rely on the tracks previous vehicles made.Boys as young as six could be seen standing near the road with bows and arrows, but we were told that they were just surveying the area and who were in the entourage.At the scene, described as the most dangerous, is a KDF camp before the bridge that separates the Pokot and Samburu communities.Within the bridge that also acts as a watering point, armed morans from the Pokot community could be seen in the hills, monitoring the area as their livestock take water.Just after the bridge, we noticed four heavily armed morans, one with two G3 riffles. They moved around, monitoring their livestock and the hills.Shortly before the bridge are young boys taking care of their livestock.Even though they are as young as five, they have been baptised to hardened lives. They are not only armed with bows and arrows but they also have a whistle they blow whenever they notice something unusual.The whistle summons morans, who include sharp shooters, out of their hidden place to respond to imminent threats.At Kapedo, two security camps belonging to APs and the GSU stand out, even though the whole bridge is under the control of the heavily armed morans.To our surprise, even lorries belonging to the police have to be given armed escorts.More experienced and armed morans with sophisticated weapons are hidden in the thick forest.Bandits in charge The first camp we find before crossing the bridge is Lomelo camp.From Lomelo, we are told that the distance to Kamunge is about 40km.The assistant chief says that not all vehicles can access the area, as it under control of bandits waylaying those attempting to cross.&ldquo;Magadi, Barakoi and Lokorio used to be business hubs, but the area has been cut off. From November, no school, no healthcare. It is God&rsquo;s favour that I&rsquo;m a doctor, an assistant chief and a security personnel as well,&rdquo; he said.Lokoruka said he has appealed to the Samburu community not to retaliate as they are law-abiding citizens.The assistant chief said fruits called mkoma have helped residents, but they are not fit for children as they make them diarrhoea and lose a lot of water.He said coming to the valley is not for the faint-hearted, as it involves a lot of planning and manoeuvring.&ldquo;You cannot come to the Sukuta valley if you are not strong. Those who have come have come with blessings,&rdquo; he said.North Rift programmes coordinator Daniel Langat said Turkana and West Pokot remain the worst-hit regions, currently at the alarming stage.Langat said the malnutrition rates for Turkana stand at 30.7 per cent.&ldquo;Turkana North and East are the worst affected by drought,&rdquo; he said.Residents are now using water scooped from sand and are fearing the last scoop may soon dry up.Math and science teacher Augustine Losekon says he has lost his job after his school Kamuge was deserted due to drought.The only children left behind are those still breastfeeding and for now, they cannot go to school, as there is no food that used to attract them.&ldquo;When the drought came, people moved from Ngelu, and this affected the school as well as health facilities,&rdquo; he says.He said the school used to have 460 pupils before drought ravaged the area.Losenkon said Kapedo used to have seven teachers, who have since moved to Lokorio. This has put education in the area at risk of stalling.
