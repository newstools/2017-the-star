The Sh62.3 billion Thwake Dam project was thrown into doubt after Water PS Patrick Mwangi defied advice and awarded the contract to the second-lowest bidder.Mwangi ignored advice by Attorney General Githu Muigai, key project financier African Development Bank, EACC and CS Eugene Wamalwa to award the tender to China Gezhouba.INQUIRY ONGOINGThe National Assembly Agriculture committee chaired by Adan Nooru has been inquiring into the tender award.It warned Mwangi last week that he will be held to account if Sh3 billion more is spent with the awarding of the tender to Sinohydro.The committee had promised to keenly follow Mwangi&rsquo;s decision.In his advice to the PS, Githu warned that the project may not take off because AfDB, which is financing 35 per cent of the project, has threatened to chanel the funds to another project should procurement controversies remain unresolved.The ministry&rsquo;s Tender Evaluation Committee recommended the contract be awarded to China Gezhouba after its Sh36.9 billion bid. It disqualified Sinohydro Tianjin Engineering whose bid for the project stood at Sh39.5 billion.Overruled decisionBut the Ministerial Tender Committee appointed by Mwangi overruled the decision to award Gezhouba citing integrity concerns. These included the blacklisting of its subsidiary firm by World Bank but AfDB wrote to the committee and PS clarifying the company had been cleared.Letters seen by the Star from Mwangi to Sinohydro demand that the firm accept renegotiation of the bid to Sh36 billion, which is equivalent to the evaluated lowest bidder.&ldquo;In this regard you are invited for a negotiation meeting on March 28 at the State Department&rsquo;s Committee room 639 on 6th floor at 2pm,&rdquo; reads the letter signed by the PS.He informs the company that the tender award will be formalised upon Muigai&rsquo;s approval and confirmation by Treasury of the availability of funds for the contract.The Star has learned that Wamalwa, US Ambassador Robert Godec, Turkana Governor Josephat Nanok, his Marsabit counterpart Ukur Yattani and USAid officials were launching the ground water mapping programme and irrigation scheme at Muruelle in Turkana when Mwangi awarded the contract to Sinohydro.The multi-purpose water project is set to supply Makueni and Kitui county residents.
