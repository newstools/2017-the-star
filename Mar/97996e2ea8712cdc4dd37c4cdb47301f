Two groups have said political goodwill is the only way to implement the contentious two-thirds gender rule in 60 days as ordered by a court.The National Gender and Equality Commission and the Kenya Women Parliamentary Association on Friday criticised MPs for dismissing the order on grounds the &ldquo;time frame is not practicable.&rdquo;National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale and deputy minority leader Jakoyo Midiwo termed the Wednesday ruling by Justice John Mativo an &ldquo;intimidation&rdquo; of Parliament.&ldquo;There has never been political goodwill to implement the two-thirds gender rule and I will forever go on record. The political goodwill should come from the government of the day, but the pattern of those who voted or absented themselves was equal from both sides,&rdquo; NGEC chairperson Winfred Lichuma told Star on the phone.A bill on the two-thirds gender rule has suffered major setbacks in the National Assembly and the Senate since 2015, due to lack of required votes. Twice, the National Assembly failed to achieve 233 votes of its 349 members. The Senate could not get 45 votes from its 67 members to pass it.The proposed law seeks to have more women in political leadership to comply with the Constitution. The law demands that not more than two-thirds of elected MPs and other leaders be of the same gender.&ldquo;The solution is there if we think outside the box. It can be implemented before the August polls. We still have the window within these 60 days if the political goodwill is there,&rdquo; Lichuma said.Duale and Midiwo, however, maintain the House cannot act on orders from the courts, saying Parliament is independent and free from interference by other arms of government.
