Clinical officers have threatened to stop offering emergency services if the SRC does not review its decision not to pay them allowances.The clinical officers held protests yesterday. They accused the Salaries and Remuneration Commission of refusing to approve allowances agreed on with the government last year.In January, the Health ministry said the allowances would be paid from this month. But the SRC has only approved health service, not emergency call, allowances. Kenya Union of Clinical Officers chairman Peterson Wachira said the SRC looks down on them. &ldquo;We have been working for the 90-plus days other medics have been on strike,&rdquo; he said.
