The Nairobi government said on Friday it is prepared for flooding and disasters, such as collapsed buildings, caused by the long rains.Governor Evans Kidero told reporters the county has mapped out flood-prone areas and opened up drainages.Critical areas are near the Nairobi River, Kirichwa Kubwa and Kirichwa Ndogo, and Ngong rivers, Kidero said.Buildings have been put up irregularly by influential people on riparian land, blocking river flow and causing flooding during rains.The governor said 1,200km of drainages have been unclogged,.A disaster management unit has been instructed to come up with strategies and respond to emergencies.Earlier this week, the weatherman announced the long rains would begin on Friday. The city has previously experienced flooding and the governor had been blamed for lack of preparedness.But Kidero says his administration will employ 8,000 youths to open clogged drainages. &ldquo;We have always been prepared. All our hospitals have enough drugs and our fire equipment are functioning,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think the coming rains will be heavier than in the past.&rdquo;On April 30 last year, a building collapsed in Hurma estate in heavy rains, killing 51 people.Last month, residents near Outering said the area had been flooded earlier after the short rains.They said drainages got blocked because of road construction in the estates. Officials said the contractor had been ordered to unblock them.In 2015, more than 10 people were killed after a wall collapsed in South B due to a downpour. Some people drowned in the floods.Commuters and motorists were stuck in traffic during heavy rains. Affected areas included Nairobi West, Lang&rsquo;ata, South B, South C and Kileleshwa. In April last year, Kenyatta Avenue was badly flooded and impassable.
