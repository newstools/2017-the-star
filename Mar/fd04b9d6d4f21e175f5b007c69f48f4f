Jubilee Party aspirants say they are sure the party will win the Mumias West and Mumias East MP posts, despite the areas being perceived as ODM strongholds.Former ODM youth leader Rashid Mohammed wants to run for Mumias West MP, while Benjamin Washiali is defending the Mumias East post, which he won in 2013 on the UDF ticket.They want to run on the JP ticket.Speaking separately, the two have pledged to ensure Jubilee gets the two slots in Kakamega county.They urged ODM to stop zoning the county, saying each party has a right to seek votes from any part of Kenya.&ldquo;Our intention as Jubilee members is to disabuse the notion that Kakamega county is an ODM zone. We want to ensure Jubilee produces leaders from this zone. We want to ask the governor to stop zoning Kakamega as an ODM zone, but let the people decide who becomes their leader,&rdquo; Washiali said.On Saturday, Mohammed asked residents not to vote on party euphoria that has given rise to incompetent leaders.&ldquo;In 2013 we were convinced to vote the ODM six-piece and this gave us wrong leaders who have failed the electorate. Weak candidates used the ODM euphoria to achieve political mileage and ascend to power. We must change from this mentality and focus on an individual in the August 8 election,&rdquo; he said.He said if elected, he will turn Mumias into a productive constituency &ldquo;because we have a lot of resources which only require to be tapped for profitability&rdquo;.Mohammed asked residents to shun tribal politics and vote for credible leaders.
