The Kenya Revenue Authority on Tuesday told the court a company associated with Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho owes Sh90 million. Judge Eric Ogolla issued an interim injunction stopping KRA from seeking taxes from the company until the matter is heard and determined.In an affidavit sworn by Jesse Kamau, KRA indicated that Portside Freight Terminal has not paid its income taxes for 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012.He also swore that KRA requires the company to remit the taxes without further delay. Kamau also advised that Portside should have written to the commission, seeking extension of time to pay the arrears.Kamau told the court the commission was right to summon the directors of the company for failing to remit the self-assessed taxes.&ldquo;The commissioner acted within the law by summoning company directors for an interview,&rdquo; Kamau said.Joho says he is being persecuted by the Jubilee administration for criticising it.Management of the business said it is not evading tax and should be granted time to clear the arrears.Portside Freight Terminal moved to the High Court in Mombasa March 2, seeking a 30-day extension to allow it pay the arrears.Company lawyer Paul Buti urged the court to hear the suit so the company does not suffer consequences of KRA&rsquo;s &ldquo;unlawful&rdquo; actions.KRA had made an immediate tax demand to the freight terminal. The money demanded includes accumulated taxes, penalties and interest.Buti asked the court to prohibit KRA from demanding, collecting or issuing agency notices for tax for 2008-12.A February 3 KRA letter says, &ldquo;You are also requested to avail the financial documents, including copies of bank statements for the years 2013, 2014 and 2015 as requested earlier.&rdquo;Buti said his client disputes the amount stated as tax accrued. The company also says the requirement to pay the taxes immediately is against the law. The case will be heard on May 15.
