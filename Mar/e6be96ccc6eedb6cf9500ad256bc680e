Election of illiterate leaders in 2013 is to blame for the failure of county assemblies to come up with laws that help ordinary wananchi, Iftin MCA aspirant Mohamed Gabow has said.The biggest mess was in the county assemblies where Kenyans elected MCAs with little education who cannot fulfil their responsibilities, he said.&ldquo;What happened in the last election, particularly in regard to devolution and election of MCAs, was an accident and a disaster. Our people did not realise their roles were almost equal to the National Assembly,&rdquo; Gabow said yesterday.&ldquo;Many Kenyans assumed that these are just low-level seats ... Five years down the line, there is a lot of regret.&rdquo;The former Garissa mayor said some MCAs blackmailed governors.&ldquo;Most MCAs saw an opportunity to enrich themselves. They resorted to arm-twisting the governors and that is why today MCAs are some of the most widely travelled individuals,&rdquo; he said.The MCAs forgot the role of oversight, representation and legislation, he said. Some governors also took advantage to loot public resources &ldquo;because there was no one to check them&rdquo;, Gabow said.He said Kenyans have now realised that they gambled with democracy and made a mistake in electing such leaders, and they are now ready to elect better leaders on August 8.Gabow said he can make a good leader, he is educated and has experience. &ldquo;The message we are sending today is correcting the mess that started with devolution,&rdquo; he said.Political analyst Mustapha Khalid said it will be difficult to stop the trend of electing semi-illiterate individuals, as most Kenyans vote for their kinsmen rather than quality leaders.
