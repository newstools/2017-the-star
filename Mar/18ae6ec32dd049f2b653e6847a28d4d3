The bullying of form one students in Kenyan secondary schools has reached crisis proportions.It takes many forms, including corporal punishment administered by prefects and senior students with the full knowledge of administrators and managers.David Kariuki, principal of the historic and prestigious Alliance High School, has just quit, following allegations of bullying that left scores of students injured.Horror stories of casual cruelty and domineering behaviour, much of it traumatising and injurious, have emanated from Alliance and many other high schools in recent weeks and days.This is unacceptable. The authorities should move with speed and investigate this scourge thoroughly.The perpetrators should disciplined and the administrators on whose watch bullying goes on unabated should be suspended &ndash; and even sacked.Bullying can have lifelong negative effects. As the poet WH Auden wrote: &ldquo;I and the public know, What all schoolchildren learn, Those to whom evil is done, Do evil in return&rdquo;.Bullying prevention strategies in schools need to be implemented without delay.
