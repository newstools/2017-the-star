The history of female genital mutilation (FGM) is not well known, but the practice dates back to at least 2,000 years ago.It is not acknowledged when or where the tradition originated from. It is believed that it was practised in Ancient Egypt as a sign of distinction amongst the aristocracy.Largely, in the history, it was believed that FGM would ensure women&rsquo;s virginity and reduction in the female desire.Moreover, some African women suppose that if their daughters are not circumcised, they will be rejected by men.Ingrained culture In Kenya, the recently marked &lsquo;International Day for Zero Tolerance&rsquo; to FGM, which was held in Garissa county early this week, has exposed habits that evenly discourage or abet FGM practice across the country.Even as the government, through the Anti-FGM Board, intensifies its synergy in fighting the practice (for example, in Garissa county, whose prevalence rate stands at 97 per cent), the myth that FGM is a rite of passage among girls is yet to leave the minds of many residents.This harmful tradition which is guided by taboos from generation by generation is supported by traditional beliefs, values and attitudes.In many countries, FGM is a prerequisite to marriage, and marriage is vital to a woman&rsquo;s social and economic survival.Additionally, perpetrators believe that the practice establishes control over the sexual behaviour of women.In countries like Sudan, Egypt and Somalia, communities value it as a means of preserving a girl&rsquo;s virginity until marriage.Given the magnitude to which many communities in Garissa believe in the practice, it&rsquo;s proving hard to convince them to dispose of FGM.For instance, in Garissa county, there are three major sub-clans under the Ogaden, namely Samawathal, Abdiwaq and Auliyan. Their opinion on whether to discard FGM practice among girls and women is determined by elders, as clanism reigns supreme.The elders&rsquo; influence and make final decisions for the community. So if they can be educated on the dangers of FGM to girls and women, its prevalence rate in Garissa will plummet.But the shortcoming is that among them, some think that FGM makes it easier for girls and women to attract suitors. They go a long way to influencing young girls to undergo the cut.Secondly they believe that girls passing through the cut are not only accepted by the society but have their character also shaped up.Setback to plans This mindset is derailing the pace at which the practice should be fought, given that Kenya is projected to have zero tolerance to FGM by 2030.However, efforts by the government to eradicate the practice in some regions are succeeding.Much work has been done in the past few years at government level, including the establishment of the national Anti-FGM Board, the introduction of a reporting hotline, a national road show programme and the formation of a team of 20 dedicated FGM prosecutors.Nationally, statistics indicate that FGM practice has dropped to 21 per cent, as compared to 38 per cent in 1998.Although there is notable progress towards making Kenya free from FGM, much has to be done to weed out the outstanding 21 per cent.This includes allocating more resources to agencies mandated to fight the practice. Furthermore, the government needs to decentralise its fight to all the 47 counties across the country.Opening up Anti-FGM Board offices in the 47 counties is key. It empowers county governments to identify and prosecute FGM perpetrators.Enforcing the Anti-FGM Act in the grassroots can also play a pivotal role of transforming people&rsquo;s minds and stands.
