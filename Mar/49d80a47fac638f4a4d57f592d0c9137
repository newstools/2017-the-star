Lamu leaders have accused the national government of discriminating against communities in delivering services. The Boni minority community in Lamu has urged the national government to ensure it treats all communities equally.Governor Issa Timamy, Lamu East MP Athman Shariff and Boni MCA Mohamed Delo said for a long time the Bonis have been discriminated in acquiring IDs, birth certificates and passports. They said they are delayed or denied.The community has several times missed out on health outreach programmes such as polio vaccinations and aid services. The politicians spoke in Lamu on Wednesday. Timamy said he has a hard time explaining to his people why they are discriminated against. &ldquo;In Kiunga, security officers have said they will not recruit local youth into the army or police simply because the area has been linked to al Shabaab. That is unfair,&rdquo; Timamy said. Shariff said the problem has been forwarded to President Uhuru Kenyatta and ministries for help.Boni MCA Mohamed Delo said more than 50 per cent of adults from Boni community do not have IDs and that the few who do have them are lucky.However, they also had to wait longer than the stipulated time to get the documents, unlike other regions, Delo said.
