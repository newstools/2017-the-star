Four fishermen drowned after their boat capsized in Bunyala South ward, Busia county on Thursday. Six people survived the 5.30pm incident that occurred between Naandeekhe fishing village and Runyu area. They are recuperating at Port Victoria Hospital. Three bodies were recovered at the time of going to press, and a search mission is on for the fourth casualty. Relatives braved the cold weather overnight as they waited for the missing body to be recovered. "I am not sure of the exact number of passengers the boat was carrying when the accident occured. I am yet to confirm," said John Odongo chair of Save Fish in Lake Victoria Association. He said the occupants did not have life saver jackets and the abrupt change of weather and strong winds, which caused the boat to overturn. He asked the county government to provide fishermen with life saver jackets as it is a major challenge. Area chief John Kudombi asked fishermen to be more careful especially in the rainy season.
