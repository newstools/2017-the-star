The three teams will come hard at us but if we match their physicality and execute better in attack and defence, then we will be in a strong position to qualify for the Cup quarterfinals,&rdquo; said Simiyu.He revealed that their target is to get ten points in each of the remaining legs.&ldquo;I am confident the boys can redeem themselves and get ten points in Vegas and Vancouver,&rdquo; added Simiyu.Skipper Andrew Amonde said the boys must bring intensity and avoid lapses in concentration. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t play one good and one bad half. Our concentration levels must be for the entire match if we are to win anything. Our mentality also needs to change,&rdquo; said Amonde.The team has been boosted by the return of Oscar Ayodi and Frank Wanyama, who played pivotal roles last season. The Kenyans will be buoyed by the thousands of fans who have travelled to Vegas to catch a glimpse of the action.Las Vegas FixturesTodayFiji v Japan (3:09am) Australia v Scotland(3:31am), Argentina v Russia (3:53am), New Zealand v Kenya (4:15am) USA v Samoa (4:37), England v Chile (4:59am), Wales v France (5:21am), South Africa v Canada (5:43am), Fiji v Scotland (6:08am), Australia v Japan (6:30am,) Argentina v Kenya (6:52am), New Zealand v Russia (7:14am), USA v Chile (7:36am), England v Samoa (7:58am), Wales v Canada (8:20am), South Africa v France (8:42am)TomorrowJapan v Scotland (12:28am), Australia v Fiji (12:50am), Russia v Kenya (1:12am), New Zealand v Argentina (1:36am), Samoa v Chile (1:58am), England v USA (2:24am), France v Canada (2:46am), South Africa v Wales (3:08am)
