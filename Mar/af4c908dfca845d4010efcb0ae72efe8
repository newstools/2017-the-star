The Japanese striker, Kazuyoshi Miura, has become the oldest professional footballer to score a competitive goal, beating Sir Stanley Matthews&rsquo; 52-year-long record.Miura, nicknamed &ldquo;Kazu&rdquo;, turned 50 last month and scored the only goal of the game as Yokohama FC recorded a 1-0 win over Thespa Kusatsu in J-League 2.The former England international Matthews held the record for the oldest professional goalscorer at the age of 50 years and five days in 1965. Miura set the new record aged 50 and 14 days old on Sunday.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to contribute to a win,&rdquo; Miura said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m always looking to score but had a good feeling about today&rsquo;s game.&rdquo;Miura took control of a deflected ball and fired an angled shot past the outstretched arms of goalkeeper Keiki Shimizu.Matthews set the previous record when he played for Stoke City against Fulham in 1965.The former Japan international, now in his 32nd season, made his professional debut in 1986 with the Brazilian side Santos before spells in his homeland with Tokyo Verdy and Vissel Kobe. Miura, who joined Yokohama in 2005, has also played for Dinamo Zagreb, Genoa and Sydney FC. He relaunched his career in the Japanese league in the late 1990s after an unsuccessful trial with Bournemouth.Despite scoring 55 goals in 89 appearances for his country, Miura is still remembered as one of the best Japanese players never to appear at a World Cup.
