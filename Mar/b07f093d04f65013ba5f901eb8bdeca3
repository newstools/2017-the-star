IEBC has extended the deadline for political parties to submit their membership lists by another seven days. In this regard, the lists are required to be with the electoral agency by March 27, and not March 19 as earlier stated. Those who miss the deadline will not be allowed to switch membership of parties. Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission posted the announcement on Twitter on Friday. The law provides that independent candidates must not have been members of a registered political three months to the polls. This means that those who fear being shortchanged by their parties must make a decision by March 27. But the extension did not go well with Kenyans who chided IEBC for changing its timelines haphazardly. Justus Onyango, a twitter user, said: "@IEBCKenya we hope you won't extend the deadline for presidential result declaration." "Stick to timelines ala! Next, you will complain of lack of time to go through process A B C," another user said. Kennedy Okeyo said: "@IEBCKenya Update Kenyans on the Progress of the Audit of the Voter Register. Thank You." IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati said at least 67 political parties submitted their nomination rules to the commission by March 2. "The commission will soon meet parties to iron out any outstanding issues that may have arisen on compliance with nomination rules," he said.
