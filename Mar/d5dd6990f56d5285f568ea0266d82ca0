Kenya yesterday became the 19th African country to commit to the African Union&rsquo;s campaign against child marriage.It declared zero tolerance to violence and discrimination against women and girls, as it joined the rest of the world in marking the International Women&rsquo;s Day.First Lady Margaret Kenyatta and UN secretary general Ant&oacute;nio Guterres led hundreds of Kenyans in the launch of Gender-Based Violence Joint GoK-UN Programme and the African Union End Child Marriage Campaign in the Comesa grounds, Nairobi.Last year, Unicef reported that about 23 per cent of girls are married before their 18th birthday.The highest number of underage marriages was recorded in Northeastern and Coast. Nairobi and Central have the lowest numbers.AUC Commissioner for Social Affairs Mustapha Sidiki said the campaign will raise public awareness and reduce child marriage.President Uhuru Kenyatta, in a speech read by the First Lady, said the two initiatives will ensure Kenya reduce sad and harrowing experiences of FGM, child marriage and sexual abuse that women and girls have endured in the past.He said women empowerment will add significant value to society.&ldquo;This administration commits to continue to address structural barriers that hinder women&rsquo;s advancement, recognise and act on women&rsquo;s unpaid care burden and invest in women&rsquo;s reproductive health services,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Additionally, we&rsquo;ll continue to ensure women get equal chances in decision-making and strive to end gender-based violence.&rdquo;Uhuru said Kenya has adopted legal and policy frameworks to protect the rights of women and girls. This aids in tackling harmful cultural practices, including FGM, which declined from 27 per cent in 2009 to 21 in 2015, he said.Uhuru urged concerned agencies to take full advantage of the legislative and policy frameworks to empower and protect women.Guterres said women&rsquo;s rights are human rights. He urged the government to empower women to protect their rights.&ldquo;Denying the rights of women and girls is not only wrong, it has serious social and economic impact that holds us all back,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Gender equality has a transformative effect that is essential to fully functioning communities, societies and economies.&rdquo;
