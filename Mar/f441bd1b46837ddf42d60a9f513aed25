Zuku Fibre has more than tripled its internet speeds over the past year making it the fastest in the country.The Wananchi Group-owned firm said it is offering customers speeds of up to 250 megabits per second under its new package dubbed Home Advanced 250Mbps. Last year the company invested Sh2.6 billion to upgrade its infrastructure including expansion of the bandwidth on the Customer Access Network, boosting connections with the world. The firm's decision to increase the speed was triggered by new ways of streaming short videos, movies, real-time gaming and live video chat. &ldquo;It is notable that other leading home Internet providers in the world are also upgrading their speeds due to changes in consumer patterns towards the consumption of fresher streaming content and an exponentially increasing demand for video on demand services,&rdquo; Zuku Fibre CEO Thomas Hintze said.
