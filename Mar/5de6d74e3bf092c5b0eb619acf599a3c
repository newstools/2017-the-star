ODM yesterday said it targets to register eight million members who will participate in the party primaries next month. The party said it will stagger its nominations between this month and April 20. Executive director Oduor Ong&rsquo;wen said the party has listed four million members since the inception of digital membership registration in May 2015. Some 1.7 million registered through the party&rsquo;s digital application for mobile phones, 800,000 through an SMS platform and the rest through manual applications. &ldquo;We hope to double the number,&rdquo; he said at a press conference at Orange House. Acting secretary general Agnes Zani said the final round is ongoing and will be closed on March 15. The party temporarily stopped the recruitment in January to allow members to register as voters with the IEBC.
