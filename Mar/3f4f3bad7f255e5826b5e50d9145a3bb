I ditched Jubilee Party for Maendeleo Chap Chap because of the political dynamics in my constituency, Tiaty MP Asman Kamama has said.Kamama said he settled on the decision after wide consultation with his supporters.&ldquo;I faced myriad accusations from my people while I was a Jubilee diehard,&rdquo; Kamama told the star on the phone on Monday.He said his people have accused him of not doing enough to ensure the Pokot are not discriminated against in the operation sto end the ongoing violence in the region.Residents say other warring communities have been favoured.Kamama said his supporters are not amused in the way people want to link him with the deaths of his political rival Engineer Pepe Kitambaa, who was a Jubilee aspirant, and Loyamorok MCA Kibet Cheretei.He said he ditched Jubilee so the public does not accuse him of having influenced Kitambaa&rsquo;s death to secure the Jubilee Party ticket during nominations.His people questioned why he is in Jubilee, which they say has done little to address banditry, volence and famine in the constituencies.Drought has cut water supply, food and pasture.Kamama said, &ldquo;Although I have crossed over to Maendeleo Chap Chap, my support still remains intact for President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto.&rdquo;He said he joined Maendeleo Chap Chap because it shares similar ideologies to that of Jubilee Party.&ldquo;I am using it as a vehicle to win the August elections, otherwise my head is still buried in Jubilee,&rdquo; Kamama said.He will face Baringo county assembly speaker William Kamket (Kanu) and Rev Simion Kiuta (Jubilee Party), eyeing the Tiaty seat.The MP joined Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua&rsquo;s party on Monday at the party headquarters after he on Friday dismissed claims that he has ditched Jubilee Party as propaganda by his opponents.Kamama had said his documents at Jubilee were intact and that he was not planning to leave Uhuru&rsquo;s party.It had been said Kamama lost prospects of getting the Jubilee ticket after people associated with him were arrested over the killing of Kitambaa and Cheretei.On February 26, Kamama narrowly escaped death when residents in his constituency attempted to lynch him. They accused him of failing to name the six gunmen from Tugen who allegedly killed the two.
