Kiambu Governor William Kabogo has urged residents to support him so he can complete projects his administration has started and ensure completed projects are successful. He said on Thursday many issues are politicised by aspirants so they can divert voters’ attention, confuse them and make them believe the government has done nothing. “I’m a true believer of God. I’m telling you some people seek political seats because they want to be rich, but I seek it to transform this county to be a role model to others,” the county boss said. Kabogo spoke at Kambaa ya Wakahoi village, Lari constituency, at the funeral of musician Muigai wa Njoroge’s cousin Samuel Njenga. The governor said many people listen to aspirants who even lie to get followers quickly. “Let us all be very careful when we deal with issues to do with development ... Many aspirants will promise you anything. We have been with you and you have witnessed what we have done and what we are doing,” Kabogo said. “Vision is God-given, and mine is very clear. I want to transform this county so that every resident will enjoy living [in it], services will be even closer than how we have brought them and more accessible; [I’ll] create more jobs than we have done.” He said he does not like politics in funerals, but added that his office started the Kiambu Biashara Fund that has helped many people start and improve their businesses. Kabogo added that his administration has upgraded hospitals. He urged residents to vote for him. Kabogo said he is optimistic he will win.
