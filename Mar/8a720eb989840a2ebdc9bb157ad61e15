The Kenya Red Cross Society is feeding over 3,000 starving families in Baringo county, as the number continues to increase on a daily basis due to the ravaging drought and insecurity.Red Cross Rift Valley official Said Anwar on Saturday distributed bags of maize flour, cartons of cowpeas, cooking oil and salt at Moinonin in Baringo North and Ameyan in Tiaty subcounty.Anwar said initially, the organisation targetted 1,500 people but the number has shot up to 3,300 families, due to the increase of deadly banditry attacks.The attacks by armed bandits saw 10 people killed and 30,000 displaced in Baringo North and South subcounties.Anwar said the number is expected to increase and called on the government, local and international institutions to join in and help get more relief&ldquo;Our contribution is but a drop in the ocean in cushioning the victims. A lot of assistance is still needed as long as the drought and insecurity are ongoing,&rdquo; he said.Besides mobile health clinics, Red Cross has also given Sh3,000 to every affected family to buy themselves some basic items.The hunger situation is worsening by the day. Many more families are living in deplorable conditions in the IDP camps.Loruk sublocation assistant chief Samuel Kamuren told media on Saturday at Moinonin that the displaced were yet to go back to their deserted homes in the volatile Yatya, Kagir, Loruk, Ng&rsquo;aratuko, Chemoe, Chepkesin, and Kapngetio areas in Baringo North, as well as in Chebinyiny, Arabal, Mukutani, Chepkalacha and Nyimbei in Baringo South. Esther Cherutoi a resident at Loruk, said she still lives in Marigat town. &ldquo;I fear for my life and children because I saw my neighbour killed in broad daylight by the armed bandits,&rdquo; she said, urging the government to beef up security in the county.
