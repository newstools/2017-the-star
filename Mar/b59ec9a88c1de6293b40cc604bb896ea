Politicians have been cautioned against violating the law and daring the Judiciary during the election campaigns. “Don’t try to test us because we are ready for you,” Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu said yesterday during the ongoing Second Annual Legislative Summit. The Judiciary is prepared to handle all disputes arising from the August 8 poll. On Friday, Chief Justice David Maraga appointed 92 special magistrates, who will deal with election offences. Mwilu said the Judiciary is aware of the critical role it plays in protecting integrity of electoral processes through resolution of election disputes and adjudication on cases. She urged politicians to read and understand the Election Offences Act. “You will conduct yourself within the law because one step outside, we are ready and waiting for you,” she said. The infamous 2007 poll dispute evolved into post-election violence. It was largely blamed on politicians. Mwilu said all disputes will be resolved within the stipulated constitutional timeframes. Previously, there have been delays in resolving cases resulting in the loss of public confidence. The deputy CJ said cohesion should be advocated during campaigns. “We have only one Kenya. Please, preserve it for our children and prosperity,” she said, adding that election will be peaceful if those conducting it stick to the law. Dispute resolution through courts will be available through a decentralised system. She said they are refurbishing some courts and added that High Court station in nine counties will be completed by next year. The Judiciary will continue to establish magistrate courts in 290 subcounties by continuous recruitment of judges, magistrates and support staff. “The Judiciary is prepared and ready to handle all disputes. We have undergone rigorous preparation that commenced after the last election,” she said. Judges, magistrate and support staff have been undergoing training on election dispute resolution.
