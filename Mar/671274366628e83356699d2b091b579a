A Senegalese Islamic channel
shocked viewers with half an hour of hardcore pornography in the
middle of the day, in what the TV station on Wednesday
attributed to a "criminal act". Privately run Touba TV generally broadcasts religious
programs, including prayer sessions, sermons from prominent
imams and in-depth theological discussions. But viewers were horrified on Monday afternoon when its
regular transmissions were interrupted with a hard porn movie. The West African country's media watchdog, CNRA, has
demanded an explanation. "We have asked Touba TV how this
unacceptable mistake could happen for almost 30 minutes," an
official told Reuters. In a statement, Touba TV denounced what it called "a
criminal act by people with a hidden agenda." It gave no further
details on the criminals or how they got access to its
broadcasting unit.
