Governor Jackson Mandago and businessman Bundotich Kiprop aka Buzeki are battling for the non-Kalenjin vote in Uasin Gishu.They have met representatives of the Kikuyu, Luhya, Luo and Kisii communities residing in the cosmopolitan county. The non-Kalenjins make up a third of the county&rsquo;s voters hence, are considered a swing vote.Last week Deputy President William Ruto cautioned Mandago and Buzeki to avoid clan politics and dividing the Kalenjins. Buzeki&rsquo;s entry into the governor race sparked rivalry between the Nandi and Keiyo, the main Kalenjin subtribes in the county. Mandago is a Nandi while Buzeki is a Keiyo.Yesterday Buzeki said, &ldquo;We all should work for the unity of all residents of Uasin Gishu. All of us deserve equal opportunities in the county.&rdquo; He spoke to the Star on the phone.
