Kenya is among countries grappling with increased insecurity because of reduced natural resources.FAO and IGAD said ravaging drought has triggered mass cross-border migrations in search of feed and water.&ldquo;Eighty-five percent of livestock from cross-border areas are on the move. Insecurity is increasing as tensions rise over access to natural resources,&rdquo; the two organisations said in an assessment.In the cross border areas, 6.5 million livestock are at high risk of death, the report said.The assessment was conducted between January 12 and 18.FAO and IGAD visited 32 locations in the cross-border areas of Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia.Some herders in the Northern parts of West Pokot county are said to have crossed into Uganda in search of water and pasture as the dry spell continues to ravage.Fighting over resources has been witnessed in various parts of the country. The assessment, released yesterday, sought to determine the impact of drought on livelihoods, food security and nutrition to inform appropriate and coordinated responses in affected areas. In the cross-border areas, the assessment revealed 380,000 agropastoral households are at a high risk of starving.The assessment shows drought has caused widespread deficits of water and pasture, contributing to weak and emaciated animals.FAO and IGAD said the movements are likely to increase the rate of disease outbreaks and mortalities, especially among sheep and cattle.Pastoral and agropastoral incomes have plummeted with low livestock value, demand and prices.The report showed access to food is decreasing. Milk and meat production is extremely low and market prices for cereals have significantly increased because of below-average harvests.
