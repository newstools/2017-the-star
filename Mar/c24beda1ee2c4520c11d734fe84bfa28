Musalia Mudavadi has distanced himself from calls by Wiper leaders for NASA talks to respect the Cord agreement.Francis Nyenze, who is National Assembly minority leader and Kitui West MP, told the Star in an interview that the Cord MoU must be part of the talks.The MoU demanded that Opposition chief Raila Odinga (ODM) supports Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka&rsquo;s presidential bid after serving the first term, which was expected to end this year.The MoU brought together Raila, Kalonzo and Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang'ula (Bungoma Senator).But Raila did not win the 2013 election.Mudavadi, who is Amani leader, noted in an address to journalists on Wednesday that he was not part of the deal.&ldquo;I was not part of the agreement signed by Cord parties so I cannot comment on it,&rdquo; he said during a meeting at his party's headquarters in Nairobi.NASA signed an agreement that nullifies all others among member parties after the dissolution of the 11th Parliament.More on this: Nasa to hold first rally in Ruto's backyard, lists seven pillars to 'Okoa Kenya'Five months to the polls, the National Super Alliance is in turmoil and facing an acrimonious split that could hand victory to President Uhuru Kenyatta.Despite a facade of unity and camaraderie among the four NASA affiliates, Wiper declared either Kalonzo is named the alliance presidential candidate &mdash; or "NASA is dead."Multiple interviews by the Star have lifted the lid on deep animosity, rivalry and mistrust among partners &mdash; ODM, ANC, Ford Kenya and Wiper &mdash; that could soon explode, killing the opposition's unity dream.For the first time since NASA's formation, Nyenze publicly insisted the 2013 MoU must be honoured to allow Kalonzo fly the Opposition flag.More on this: NASA facing split over Raila, Kalonzo MoUBut Mudavadi said parties in the National Super Alliance are united and will transform Kenya after winning the August 8 election."In Nasa, we are working together for a common goal. Everyone has his strategy. I don&rsquo;t need to stand on every podium to say I should be the NASA flag bearer,&rdquo; said the Amani boss.He added that everyone in the party had a right to use his strategy to campaign for himself.&ldquo;When Kalonzo stands up and says he should be a flag bearer, maybe he wants to up his stake,&rdquo; he said.Mudavadi said Opposition parties will focus on the primaries st for April and choose a flag bearer before May 10.
