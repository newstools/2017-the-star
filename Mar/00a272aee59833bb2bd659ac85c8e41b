President Uhuru Kenyatta is using his fifth and final budget before the August polls &mdash; Sh2.62 trillion &mdash; to appeal to the common man.The proposed budget is Sh340 billion higher than the Sh2.26 trillion for 2016-17.Treasury CS Henry Rotich yesterday announced drastic measures to bring down the cost of living and the cost of food, which has been shooting up.But he also slapped a uniform 50 per cent 'sin tax' tax on all forms of betting and gaming, saying they have negative social effects.The theme was help for wananchi.Maize and wheat flour will be exempted from VAT.Households, manufacturers and low-income earners were among the biggest winners in the budget presented to Parliament.The budget also seeks to grow the manufacturing sector and create jobs.Maize imports will be tax free for four months, a move to ease the effects of ravaging drought.&ldquo;Manufacturers, wholesaler, and retailers who sell such goods will be expected to reduce the prices of these basic commodities, failure to which, I will reverse the policy,&rdquo; Rotich said. &ldquo;In addition to further lower the cost to wananchi, the importation of maize during the next four months will be duty free. I expect, therefore, to see a reduction of prices for these basic commodities enjoyed by majority of our people.&rdquo;Rotich also proposed to amend the income Tax Act, increasing the number of low-income earners exempted from tax. The lowest taxable income would be raised from Sh11,135 per month to Sh13,486.&ldquo;This measure will to a large extent increase the take home income of a majority of low-income earners,&rdquo; he said.On industrialisation, Rotich has proposed a number of amendments to the Income Tax Act.They include reducing withholding tax from 15 per cent to five per cent on interest payable to non-residents by Special Economic Zones Enterprises, to promote Foreign Direct Investments.Motor vehicle assemblers will enjoy a corporate rate of 15 per cent for the first five years, down from from the current 30 per cent.Inputs used to manufacturei pesticides will also be exempted from VAT.Rotich proposed to amend the Excise Duty Act to allow refund of excise duty paid on illuminating kerosene used to manufacture paints and resin by registered producers.Last year, Rotich last year reintroduced excise duty on kerosene, which had been scrapped in 2011, at a rate of Sh7,205 per 1,000 litres.The window for wealth declaration by Kenyans living aboard &mdash; who wish to repatriate their wealth &mdash; has been extended to June 30, 2018, from December 31, this year. Medical equipment and apparatus for use in specialised hospitals have also been exempted from tax.SIN TAXRotich has however hit hard betting firms in the wake of increased betting activities in the country.Taxes for betting, lottery, gaming and competition will be increased from the current rates of 7.5 per cent, five per cent, 12 per cent and 15 per cent, respectively, to a uniform tax rate of 50 per cent for all categories.&ldquo;Betting and gaming have become widespread in our society in an environment that is inadequately regulated,&rdquo; Rotich said. &ldquo;Its expansion is beginning to have negative social effects, in particular on the young and vulnerable members of our society.&rdquo;The Treasury expects KRA to raise Sh1.7 trillion in ordinary revenues and appropriation-in-aid from July 1.This is about Sh188.5 billion on top of the Sh1.5 trillion revised target for the current financial year ending on June 30.The proposed budget is 15.9 per cent larger (about Sh340 billion) more than the Sh2.26 trillion budget for current year.Total expenditure and net lending are projected at Sh2.287 trillion, equivalent to 26.3 per cent of GDP.To meet the revenue targets, Rotich has also gone after manufacturers and importers of distilled liquor.Spirits will be taxed at Sh200 per litre, up from 175 per litre.Taxation of beer has not changed Excise duty will drop by 80 per cent on local beer made from locally produced sorghum, millet, or cassava or any produce, excluding barley.The move aims to discourage consumption of unsafe illicit alcohol.Locally produced low-value cigarettes have also been protected from competition. The CS proposed a two-tier tax structure of Sh2,500 per mille for cigarettes with filters and Sh1,800 per mille for plain cigarettes &ldquo;to cushion local cigarette manufacturers from adverse financial effects due to loss in market&rdquo;.&ldquo;This tax measure will ensure equity and fairness in the tobacco industry and prevent job losses in this sector,&rdquo; he said.Meanwhile, the Jubilee government plans to spend Sh1.347 trillion on recurrent expenditure and Sh640.3 billion on development.The budget defict will be Sh524.6 billion, six percent of GDP.This will be financed through borrowing from both external and domestic sources.Net external financing will amount to Sh256.0 billion, 2.9 per cent of GDP, and will be mainly on concessional terms. Domestic borrowing will account for Sh268.6 billion.&ldquo;Non-concessional external borrowing will be limited to projects with viable expected returns and ceilings in the medium-term debt strategy,&rdquo; he said.Infrastructure, security, energy, agriculture and health are among the government&rsquo;s priorities.Sh134.9 billion has been allocated to roads, including Sh63.6 billion for ongoing road construction, Sh44.3 billion for foreign financed roads and Sh27 billion for low-volume seal roads.Treasury allocated Sh49.3 billion for maintenance from the Road Maintenance Levy.&rdquo;Geothermal projects will get Sh6.4 billion, the.Last Mile Project will get Sh9.7 billion, and the standard gauge railway will get Sh75 billion.Sh8.1 billion is for leasing police e vehicles, Sh24.8 billion for police and military modernisation and Sh12 billion for security operations.
