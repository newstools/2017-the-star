Bungoma Governor Kenneth Lusaka has urged residents to shun tribalism and live together in harmony. “I want to humbly appeal to all the tribes in Bungoma to let us cooperate and live together as one people, especially as we head towards the general election,” he said. Lusaka was addressing the press on Thursday at Webuye East constituency after meeting members of the Abhabhiya clan of the Tachoni subtribe. He said tribalism is a major obstacle to development and should not be tolerated. Lusaka urged residents not to elect leaders who try to divide the county along tribal lines. “You will hear them in their campaigns as the election nears trying to tell you tribal vibes in the name of asking for votes. Do not even listen to such politicians,” he said. Bungoma is predominantly made up of the Bukusu, Iteso, Tachoni, Sabaot and Batura communities. fairness Lusaka said he has tried his best to incorporate all the tribes in Bungoma in his government. He urged residents to ensure every region has a representative in an elective post for balanced leadership. “We want a scenario whereby if the governor comes from this region, the deputy should hail from the other region, a senator from another region and woman representative another one,” he said.
