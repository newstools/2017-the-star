The counties will not be allocated extra money since they mismanage funds, the National Assembly Budget Committee has said.In February, the Senate sided with the governors and amended the 2017-18 Division of Revenue Bill, which now gives the counties Sh20 billion more.However, the National Assembly raised concerns, saying the governors have failed to adequately account for the funds received.Speaking on Saturday in Kiritiri, Mbeere South, Budget Committee chairman Mutava Musyimi said the governors have no justification in their demand for more funds.He said MPs will not give in to the governors&rsquo; demands. He said their performance in the four years they have been in office has been poor.&ldquo;The money we give and the projects we are seeing on the ground are not adding up. So for them to come to us asking for more money, we say &lsquo;no&rsquo;,&rdquo; Mutava said.He said the governors have failed to deliver services, which was the main objective of devolution.&ldquo;The governors&rsquo; demands for more funds from the national government are tantamount to embezzling public funds,&rdquo; Mutava said.This comes less than one week before the National Treasury presents the 2017-18 budget.During the fourth annual devolution conference, held on March 4 to 6, governors rekindled the push for more funds for the counties.They vowed to amend Article 203 of the Constitution to increase the equitable allocation to 45 per cent, from the current 15 per cent of national revenue.&ldquo;If there&rsquo;s a major function for [the] governors, the first thing to do is to ensure there is enough parking for choppers, then vehicles, then motorcycles and finally bicycles,&rdquo; Mutava said.&ldquo;Where have these helicopters come from in four-five years?&rdquo;
