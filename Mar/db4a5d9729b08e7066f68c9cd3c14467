The government's withdrawal of a Sh14.5 billion offer for striking doctors was drastic, the Senate Health committee chairman has said.Wilfred Machage said he did not agree with the uncompromising health workers but that the government should give them a chance and reconsider the cancellation."I think the government should have waited a little longer before taking these drastic measures," he told the 4th Annual Devolution Conference in Naivasha, Nakuru county, on Thursday."You cannot replace doctors [who have been practising in Kenya] with those who have no experience."The chairman, who is Migori Senator, said he hoped President Uhuru Kenyatta would rescind his decision.The government had proposed the "good gesture" of backdating health workers' risk allowances to July 2016, a package that would cost a total of Sh600 million.The alternative was backdating the emergency allowance to October 2016, an expense that would have added up to Sh570 million. Council of Governors chairman Peter Munya, who announced the cancellation, said the offer also included a 50 per cent increase in salaries.Munya said the government will immediately take disciplinary action against staff who absconded duty to facilitate the hiring of new workers. But he said doctors who had been on duty and those willing to return to work would benefit.The President also warned the medics saying that offer was the only one the government could extendRead: State withdraws Sh14.5b offer for striking doctors, to hire workers afreshAlso read: We will have a problem if pay talks flop, Uhuru warns striking doctorsMachage scolded the doctors in February and asked them to take the government's offer of a 40 per cent rise in their salaries.The lowest paid doctor would be going home with Sh196,989 up from the current Sh140,244. But unions rejected the offer and walked out of talks."Don't let the 40 per cent offer go. Soften a little...have somewhere to start... it is something to start with," Machage said at the time. "Soften a bit...do not just stick with the implementation of the CBA."During the conference, Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya supported the chairman saying county bosses had not agreed to hire doctors afresh."During the meeting we did not resolve to hire doctors from specific countries. Foreign doctors might even ask for more than we can afford," he said.
