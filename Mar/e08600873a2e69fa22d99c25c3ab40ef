Nyeri Senator Mutahi Kagwe has declared interest in becoming governor.He said his decision followed wide consultations with leaders and wananchi, which lasted more than a year.Kagwe said he will vie on the Jubilee Party ticket. His announcement comes barely a week after the burial of Nyeri&rsquo;s first Governor Nderitu Gachagua, who died in a London hospital.Gachagua&rsquo;s successor Samuel Wamathai has also declared his interest in the seat.Mathira MP aspirant Rigathi Gachagua, the former governor&rsquo;s younger brother, has abandoned his bid to vie for governor, although he is yet to officially launch his campaign.This has raised political temperatures in the county ahead of the April 20 Jubilee Party nominations. Others in the race include former director of Vision 2030 Wahome Gakuru, industrialists Githinji Cocorico and Thuo Mathenge (owner of Brade Gate Poultry Industries), hotelier Patrick Munene and Wachira Keen (the Athi Water Services chairman).Kagwe made the announcement outside his office at Muringato on the outskirts of Nyeri town yesterday. He was with more than 100 leaders.The senator did not announce his running mate, saying he will do so after the nominations. Kagwe said he understands both national and local politics.&ldquo;Devolution aims to manage resources the best way possible. I will be brave enough to walk a new path since a new paradigm shift is needed in Nyeri. All my voters and the Lord are behind me,&rdquo; he said.Kagwe said he will set aside more resources for the youth and women, and champion value addition for agricultural products such as milk, coffee, tea and vegetables.He said his real passion is managing the people&rsquo;s resources, but &ldquo;I could not do this as a senator because the role of implementation was not mine.&rdquo;
