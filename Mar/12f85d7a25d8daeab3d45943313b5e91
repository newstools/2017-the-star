Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen is right when he says the election laws requiring leaders to meet academic qualifications should be scrapped. Murkomen argues the electorate has a right to elect people with leadership skills and track records without reference to academic qualifications.He says he feels for leaders who have been compelled to acquire academic papers through questionable means just to qualify to stand for office.There is such a thing as a worthless qualification and Kenya increasingly has graduates who have never read a book cover to cover - and never will.If you read Hansard, you will find that the quality of lawmaking in Kenya was much better and more thoughtful in the 1960s, when few MPs were graduates.The legendary Tom Mboya and Martin Shikuku were non-graduate parliamentary debaters who are remembered to this day.Microsoft founder Bill Gates and the novelist-essayist Gore Vidal would not qualify to run for MP in Kenya. Degrees don&rsquo;t make people better leaders.
