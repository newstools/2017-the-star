A man wants the courts to abolish legal fees for filing cases to enforce rights.Jacob Nyandega Osoro has sued Chief Justice David Maraga and Chief Registrar of the Judiciary Anne Amadi. His main complaint stems from procedure rules put in place on June 25, 2013 by CJ Willy Mutunga.The rules in question provide that courts handle all cases presented before it to achieve timely disposal of proceedings at a cost that can be afforded by parties.The rules known as the Constitution of Kenya Protection of Rights and Fundamental Freedoms Practice and Procedure Rules 2013 also provided that in case anyone wishes to be exempted from paying court fees, he or she may apply to the registrar.If allowed this will attract many Kenyans who have always wanted enforcement of the Bill of Rights to approach the court and seek interpretation.It will lead to development of jurisprudence and open the justice system doors to the poor, who have been kept at bay by legal fees.Currently, judiciary officials at every court registry assess the documents filed in court and impose a fee, which is paid before the documents are stamped and placed before judges for hearings.Osoro says because of these rules, his rights to institute court proceedings in relation to the Bill of Rights have been denied. He says the rules violate Section 22 (3) of the Constitution, which provides that the CJ shall make rules, which shall satisfy the criteria that no fee may be charged for commencing proceedings.
