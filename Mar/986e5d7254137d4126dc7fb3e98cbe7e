The energy the Opposition uses to attack President Uhuru Kenyatta should be directed to the general election, Kigumo MP Jamleck Kamau has said.Kamau told NASA chiefs, led by Cord leader Raila Odinga, that their claims on lack of development were insincere."Uhuru means well for this country. If Raila wants to beat him he should sell his agenda rather than waste time saying nothing has been done," he said."NASA has no candidate. They do not know who will fly their flag but are focused on criticising everything the government does. It leaves a lot of question on what their priorities are."He told the National Super Alliance to focus on issues that affect the common good of Kenyans. "We all have a stake in our nation...fighting the sitting President does not make them better leaders," said the Murang'a governor aspirant.He spoke on Friday at Kigumo Social Hall where he issued Uwezo fund cheques worth Sh6.1 million.But Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang'ula said yesterday that all NASA chiefs were better than the President. The other two are Wiper's Kalonzo Musyoka and Musalia Mudavadi of Amani National Congress.He told the press on Friday that they were all capable of saving the country from oppression by Jubilee Party.Opposition leaders formed the super coalition with the aim of having a force strong enough to remove Uhuru power.They have accused Uhuru of failing Kenyans in matters including corruption, health, resource distribution and the presence of Kenya Defence Forces soldiers in Somalia.Regarding the flag bearers, Wetang'ula asked the public not to be unduly anxious as a special committee is still doing its work.More on this: All NASA chiefs are better than Uhuru, Wetang'ula says on flag bearer debateKamau praised the ruling Jubilee coalition citing road projects, the Standard Gauge Railway and electricity supply.He said the Uwezo fund Uhuru initiated has significantly transformed the lives of women, youths and people living with disabilities.

If Raila wants to beat him he should sell his agenda rather than wasting time saying nothing has been done," he said.The legislator added that Kenya's image abroad has improved going by the number of world leaders who have visited and signed deals with Uhuru.Read: Kenyans don t want tribal cocoons and conflict, they want development Uhuru[VIDEO] Uhuru, Ruto use projects to weaken Raila
