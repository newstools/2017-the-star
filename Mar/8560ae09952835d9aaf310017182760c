Celebrity cop Linda Okello who shot to fame after pictures of her curvy shape went viral on social media has been fired from the Traffic department and moved to the Molo police station.She was transferred yesterday. This comes 13 months after she was demoted from a corporal to a constable after she was accused of taking a bribe. She allegedly was found with a Sh1,000 note during an operation by Traffic headquarters. Okello&rsquo;s two colleagues escaped but she stayed put. Okello has been serving at the Kiambu Traffic department. She will now perform general duties. Following the transfer, her new assignments will include patrol and guarding and ferrying suspects to and from court. Okello became famous for her tight skirt. Kenyans joked that security had never been tighter. She was later voted one of the best woman representatives in the service.Traffic commandant Jacinta Muthoni, Okello&rsquo;s supervisor at the Traffic department, in January declined to comment on demotion. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t comment on administrative issues. Who leaked the information? I&rsquo;ll not comment. Ask the higher authorities,&rdquo; she said on the phone. An officer, who sought anonymity, said it was unfair to demote Okello without evidence of corruption.
