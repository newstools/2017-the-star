National Super Alliance leader Raila Odinga has dismissed Jubilee&rsquo;s claims linking him to the single-sourcing of a Sh3.8 billion elections management system to a French firm by the IEBC.Raila yesterday denied the claims by National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale and Water CS Eugene Wamalwa that he could have influenced the award of the tender to Safran because the owners of the firm are his close allies.Duale and Wamalwa demanded Raila to come clean on the matter during their Sunday rally in Malindi.They said he knows much about the firm, including how it won another contract in 2013 by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission headed by former chairman Issack Hassan.Duale also put the IEBC chaired by Wafula Chebukati on the spot over claims Raila played a role in the awarding of the tender to Safran last Friday.&ldquo;That is just Jubilee propaganda that I don&rsquo;t want to get involved in,&rdquo; Raila said after addressing an ODM women aspirants meeting at Multi-Media University.Homa Bay woman representative Gladys Wanga termed the claims &ldquo;baseless&rdquo; and challenged Jubilee to give evidence.&ldquo;We are not going to respond to such Jubilee propaganda intending to delay the August 8 election,&rdquo; Wanga said.Raila, during the meeting attended by women drawn from 47 counties, said they are the &ldquo;hardest-hit&rdquo; in political representation, hence assured them of free, fair, peaceful and credible party nominations starting April 13.He said ODM has put in place measures, including reducing nomination fees for women aspirants to Sh15,000 and the right environment for them to compete in clinching tickets.&ldquo;We have issued firm instructions to the National Elections Board that ODM does not condone any form of violence, intimidation and fraud during nominations,&rdquo; Raila said.He added, &ldquo;As party leader, I have instructed the National Elections Board to take firm action, including disqualifying aspirants who use violence in the upcoming nominations. Our policy of zero tolerance of all forms of political violence, especially against women aspirants, must come alive in the primaries.&rdquo;The ODM leader asked women to come out in large numbers and contest, saying only 775 women contested in the 2013 polls, out of the 12,488 candidates nationwide.&ldquo;This is a dismal record that ODM does not want to be associated with in the August election.&rdquo;
