The Communications Authority of Kenya, the telecoms regulator, said yesterday it had no plans to break up any company in the sector. This came weeks after a leaked draft report on competition it commissioned recommended that Safaricom, the country's biggest operator, be split."It is not the authority's intention to punish success," CA chairman Ben Gituku told a news conference.Gituku said they were discussing the report with telecoms operators and asked the public to ignore the recent reports in local newspapers that the draft findings recommended that Safaricom's mobile money payment M-Pesa be separated from its Safaricom's telecoms business.He said the report on competition was being finalised and it would be released in May.The authority's comments cement the government's position, given earlier this month, when the information minister said he was opposed to a move by a legislator to amend the law to break up Safaricom.ICT CS Joe Mucheru on March 9, however, opposed the proposed legislation, saying the government was keen fully enforcing infrastructure sharing, interoperability and price changes to address issues of dominance if they arise.Safaricom marked 10 years since the launch of M-Pesa on March 6, 2007 by UK's Vodafone, which holds a 40 per cent stake in East and Central Africa's most profitable company.A draft report commissioned by the CA was leaked and published in one of the dailies on February 23. The document, by UK's research and advisory firm Analysys Mason, is said to have recommended the separation of M-Pesa from Safaricom because the firm is too dominant.&ldquo;The government has been very clear that it does not want to split M-Pesa from Safaricom, it has been one report by an external party and we don&rsquo;t even have sight of that report,&rdquo; Safaricom's director for financial services Ronald Webb said in an interview last Friday.Safaricom is also Kenya's biggest firm by market capitalisation and dwarfs the two other operators in the mobile market: the local subsidiary of India's Bharti Airtel and Orange, which the French telecoms company agreed last year to sell to London-based Helios Partners.The smaller operators have long argued that Safaricom enjoys a dominant position because it accounts for 90 percent of revenues in areas such as voice calls and text messages.Safaricom rejects the accusations of dominance.
