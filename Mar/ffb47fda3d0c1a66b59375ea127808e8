I hesitate. Mr N has just asked me whom I have feelings for and I&rsquo;m not sure what to tell him. I&rsquo;d prefer to steer the conversation back to the Arab and his alternative sexual tastes. Why does he care anyway?Me: It doesn&rsquo;t matter. When do I meet my mark?Him: No time like the present. Today after work.Me: Ok. See you then.Him: And it matters.Me: Why?He doesn&rsquo;t respond. We meet after work and drive to a Lebanese restaurant that the Arab likes to visit. Mr N doesn&rsquo;t bring up our earlier conversation. I&rsquo;m relieved but also irritated. I thought he&rsquo;d badger me a little more at least.The Arab is already waiting for us and is accompanied by his younger brother. My mark is very tall, overweight and not very attractive. The genetic lottery was kinder on his brother. They both clearly like what they see and I&rsquo;m disappointed that the older brother is the mark. He is smoking shisha and offers me some.&ldquo;Sit next to me, let&rsquo;s smoke,&rdquo; he says.I shake my head. &ldquo;No, thanks,&rdquo; I say.&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t smoke?&rdquo; he asks. &ldquo;Not shisha,&rdquo; I respond. &ldquo;A little reefer, though, never hurt anyone.&rdquo;&ldquo;Reefer?&rdquo; he asks.Mr N smiles. &ldquo;That can always be arranged.&rdquo;&ldquo;Here?&rdquo; I ask, surprised.&ldquo;No, not here,&rdquo; he scoffs. &ldquo;But we can take this party to his place later,&rdquo; he says, turning to the Arab. His name is Nabil, and with Mr N&rsquo;s words, he turns his huge girth towards me.&ldquo;Yes, I live down the road,&rdquo; he agrees. &ldquo;But this reefer, what is it?&rdquo;I look towards Mr N, who doesn&rsquo;t seem to be in a hurry to explain.&ldquo;A reefer is God&rsquo;s most glorious gift to mankind,&rdquo; I say. &ldquo;You may know it by a different name.&rdquo;I then name for or five other slang words that describe the herb. Understanding washes over his face quickly and he starts to explain to his brother in Arabic what I want. Mr N comes to sit next to me.&ldquo;So who is this guy you have feelings for?&rdquo; he asks.&ldquo;Oh, beware my lord of jealousy; it is the green-eyed monster that doth mock the meat it feeds on,&rdquo; I respond.&ldquo;You read Shakespeare?&rdquo; he asks.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m an editor of a magazine. You keep forgetting,&rdquo; I say.&ldquo;I read that play for my literature exam in school. Othello. A gullible character who blindly trusts his subordinate, Lago, rather than his wife, Desdemona,&rdquo; says Mr N, sipping his drink.&ldquo;His life ultimately becomes a tragedy as a result of this,&rdquo; I say. "It is tragic. He had incredibly low self-esteem."Nabil is still talking to his brother.&ldquo;Who are you in this story?&rdquo; Mr N asks, shifting his gaze to me.&ldquo;Desdemona,&rdquo; I reply.He pauses. &ldquo;Not Lago?&rdquo; he asks, and then laughs at my frown.&ldquo;First of all you don&rsquo;t blindly trust me,&rdquo; I say. &ldquo;Secondly, you ask whom I have feelings for when it is obvious they are for you. Thirdly, I think you&rsquo;re jealous, which is self-defeatist because I need to sleep with other people to make you money.&rdquo;Mr N raises a sardonic brow. &ldquo;You are not Desdemona. Lago manipulates with his words, as you do. You expect me to believe you have feelings for me and you&rsquo;re about to screw my friend here?&rdquo;Just at that moment, all the conversation at the table has halted and the song that was playing in the background has just ended. His words are heard clearly by all.&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on, bruh?&rdquo; Nabil protests. &ldquo;I thought you brought her for me?&rdquo;
