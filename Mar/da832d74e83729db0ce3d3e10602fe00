West Pokot Senator John Lonyangapuo has dismissed claims politicians are behind fights among pastoralist communities as debate on the violence found its way to the Senate.He said the banditry attacks in the North Rift are as a result of scarcity of pasture and water.&ldquo;I think we are blaming the wrong people&hellip;. When a politician questions what is happening, instead of responding, you say they (politicians) are covering up the issue,&rdquo; Lonyangapuo said.He was contributing to a debate on the President&rsquo;s State of the Nation Address as the Senate resumed sittings on Tuesday.Lonyangapuo faulted the move by President Uhuru Kenyatta to deploy the military to Baringo, Marakwet and Laikipia to combat armed bandits, saying there were better ways to end the fighting.He urged the state to work with reformed cattle rustlers and the clergy to initiate peace talks.&ldquo;We have to use strategies that make sense. We have reformed warriors and pastors. Why can&rsquo;t we use them?&rdquo; Lonyangapuo said.The state should concentrate on mitigating the drought that caused shortage of food for animals and humans or the conflict will degenerate into an inter-ethnic war, he said.Lonyangapuo urged the government to tackle the menace with the same vigour used to fight drug trafficking.Catholic Diocese of Eldoret Bishop Cornelius Korir, who spearheaded peace talks in the region, on Friday said only dialogue will end the persistent attacks.
