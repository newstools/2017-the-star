An Embu woman representative aspirant has pledged to fight disinheritance of widows and single women. Businesswoman Edith Gatugi on Friday said women suffer after the death of their husbands and fathers. “We have a major problem, where women whose husbands die or whose fathers die ill-motivated brothers chase them out of the family to disinherit them of land and other property. This is a fight I will help women to carry to the bitter end if elected woman representative,” she said. Gatugi pledged to set up programmes to teach women about their right to ownership of family property. She said the programme will provide financial assistance to widows facing disinheritance to seek legal redress. Gatugi denounced child marriage. She said she will ensure everyone who marries an underage girl is prosecuted. Other hopefuls are Deputy Governor Dorothy Nditi, Jane Wanjuki, Mary Marigu, Monicah Cyombua, Sophia Muthoni, Susan Njamiu and the incumbent Rose Mitaru.
