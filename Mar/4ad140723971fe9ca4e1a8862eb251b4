Besieged Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho has admitted he scored a D-minus in the 1993 KCSE exam results.He said a low score does not mean one cannot prosper hence his quest to be President in 2022.On Monday, Joho, through his aide Richard Chacha, said he did &lsquo;several&rsquo; courses before being admitted at the University of Nairobi for a degree course.He had said Joho scored a C-plus, raising more questions over authenticity of his degree certificate that has seen Jubilee sustain efforts to have him blocked from defending his governor seat.D minus is way below the cutoff points for one to be allowed to enroll in any college.&ldquo;You will hear it. Let&rsquo;s wait,&rdquo; Joho said yesterday, when asked if he bridged courses to enable him to pursue a degree course. He said the law allows poor performers to explore alternative options, but only cited bridge courses.The governor will be questioned today by assistant Inspector General Pius Macharia over his academic papers row.Joho criticised government officials for releasing confidential information to the public, making him a laughingstock on social media. The governor says his woes are Jubilee&rsquo;s desperate attempt to drive public agenda and put him on defensive and at fault.&ldquo;They will not succeed,&ldquo; Joho said. &ldquo;I pray to God that during the election, Kenyans will show President Uhuru Kenyatta that the will of the people prevailed.&rdquo;Addressing a press conference yesterday, Joho said Jubilee is persecuting him and has unleashed all manner of tactics to silence him because he has asked the goverment &lsquo;hard&rsquo; questions.He cited queries over the privatisation of the Kenya Ports Authority, the exorbitant cost of the standard gauge railway, the dry port in Naivasha, and land and historical injustices. He said every agency within the Jubilee administration is investigating him, with the latest intrusion by the Ministry of Health to have his birth certificate scrutinised.&ldquo;Sleuths have been sent to my nursery school &ndash; Tononoka &ndash; and former primary school Tom Mboya,&rdquo;Joho (pictured) said. &ldquo;They can even go ahead and check my marriage certificate if they want.&rdquo;
