The race for Wajir governor is gaining momentum, with aspirants criss-crossing the vast county to sell their agenda to the electorate.Former Ambassador to Saudi Arabia Mohamed Abdi on Tuesday said if elected, he would strive to unite all communities living in Wajir.A day earlier, Governor Ahmed Abdullahi addressed residents in Wajir town. He was with leaders and elders.Abdi addressed residents in Qorahey grounds accompanied by Degodia clan members and three MPs, MCAs and businesspeople.He said he would bring the much-needed change, accusing Abdullahi of doing little to improve the living standards of the "suffering" people.The Fafi sub-clan of the Degodia clan a month ago dropped its governor aspirant nominee Ugaas Sheikh and picked Abdi, whom they said is stronger.MPs supporting Abdi include Mohamed Elmi (Tarbaj), Abass Sheikh (Wajir EAst) and Adan Keynan (Eldas).Elmi, who has said he is retiring from politics, said the clan resolved to support Abdi because he is a veteran politician capable of uniting all the communities.Keynan warned against use county resources to campaign.&ldquo;It in unfortunate to see staff and county vehicles involved in campaigns. This is not fair at all. It will not create a level playing ground for aspirants. We ask the police to take note of that,&rdquo; he said. Abdullahi defeated Abdi in the 2013 general election with a margin of 4,000 votes.
