The heated debate as to whether Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo is the greatest footballer on earth is coming to an end.It&rsquo;s neither.The new kid on the top is Neymar da Silva Santos Junior. If Barcelona could be bullied, threatened or blackmailed into selling him the enormity of the money would make that assessment as difficult to argue with as Neymar&rsquo;s inspiring of Brazil to become the first nation to qualify for the 2018 World Cup finals.Neither the size of the transfer fee nor the scale of the weekly pay packet is the most reliable yardstick by which to measure genius.That is manifestly the case with Paul Pogba, currently the record purchase at &pound;89.3m (Sh11.4bn).But when Manchester United are ready to virtually double that deal &ndash; a dubious one given Pogba&rsquo;s posturing form at Old Trafford to date &ndash; by shipping out &pound;173m (Sh22bn) to Catalonia then who are we to argue with the judgement of Jose Mourinho?Less so when apparently they are ready to pay Neymar &pound;416,000 (Sh53m) a week, a rise from his current seven-day stipend of &pound;260,000 (Sh33m) which would leave Leo and Ronnie feeling they are earning peanuts.Spanish newspaper reports of United&rsquo;s all-costs desire to buy this sunshine boy gain credibility when the Special One tells ESPN television that dearly as he would love to recruit Neymar &lsquo;it would be like me trying to break into a safe.All the more so, since Messi is close to imploding even as he approaches renewal of his own Nou Camp contract. The highs &ndash; most incredibly of late in the historic four-goal overhauling of Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League &ndash; have been outnumbered of late by indifferent results against lesser teams which leave Barca trailing Real Madrid in La Liga.And although Ronaldo has much to do with Real&rsquo;s ascendancy, he does not have the same global platform with Portugal as Neymar with Brazil. This 25-year-old&rsquo;s lithe, deft, electrifying interpretation of what his luminous forefather Pele called the Beautiful Game is reviving football&rsquo;s faith in the legend of Brazil.The innocent delight with which Neymar has assumed the mantle of greatness is bringing back the romance, capturing hearts and minds the world over.The old samba spirit enlivens his happy celebrations &ndash; witness him shimmying with his girlfriend late into the night after Brazil stamped their passport to Russia 2018 &ndash; but when he goes clubbing it is a soft drink which he is seen to be clutching in his spare hand.Messi&rsquo;s frustrations, meanwhile, spilled over into foul-mouthed abuse of an assistant referee as Argentina lost on the rarefied heights of Bolivia to plunge their hopes of qualification into jeopardy.Tut, tut Senor Role Model.Given that Messi, for whatever reason, has so far failed to apply to his formidable club legacy the hallmark of a World Cup-winning performance, the chalice of greatness would seem destined to be passed to his Brazilian club-mate in Moscow next summer. If so, few will begrudge this delightful young man that distinction.It should not be long before England&rsquo;s footballers follow Brazil in stamping their Russia 2018 visas. Among the young hopefuls in that queue we should find the veteran goal-scorer who played a major part in bringing World Cup qualification ever closer by notching the opening goal in Sunday&rsquo;s Wembley win over Lithuania.Which begs the question of why Jermain Defoe was left largely idle as England floundered in recent World Cups. An embarrassing question for a couple of Gareth Southgate&rsquo;s predecessors as the national team manager.
