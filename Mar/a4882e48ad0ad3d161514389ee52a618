Liverpool midfielder Philippe Coutinho cannot see his side slipping below local rivals Everton by the end of the season as the teams gear up for a Premier League Merseyside derby on Saturday.Everton, currently three places behind their fourth-placed city rivals in the league table, can cut the gap to just three points with a victory at Anfield.Coutinho, who is away on international duty with Brazil, said he was concentrating only on Liverpool&rsquo;s progress.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think about (Everton&rsquo;s form) or worry about that,&rdquo; said Coutinho. &ldquo;We will be ready. The derby is a very special match for everyone, the fans and the players.&rdquo;Liverpool are unbeaten in Merseyside encounters since 2010 but will face a Ronald Koeman side that have picked up 23 of 30 points since the turn of the year.Coutinho acknowledged Everton&rsquo;s recent progress and said it would mean a lot more to the fans if Liverpool could find a way to win the derby.&ldquo;We know what it means... this time it is even more because Everton have improved so much in recent weeks,&rdquo; he added.&ldquo;We know it won&rsquo;t be easy but we know we have to win, for our fans, for our morale and for everybody.&rdquo;Liverpool have lost just one out of their 14 league games at Anfield this season, scoring 36 goals and conceding 13 in the process.
