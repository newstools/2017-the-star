Garissa will engage doctors on strike and not rush to sack them as the county cannot afford to be without medics, Governor Nathif Jama said yesterday.&ldquo;Recruiting the current doctors took us time and a lot of convincing, given the hardship conditions. We cannot therefore just sack them with the stroke of a pen. We know what it takes to employ a qualified doctor in Northeastern region,&rdquo; he told the press in his office.All the 22 doctors in Garissa county took part in the strike and have not reported for duty, despite threats to sack them.Nathif said the county is concerned about the continued push and shove between the doctors and the national and county governments, terming it &ldquo;unhealthy&rdquo;.&ldquo;We pray that doctors find sense and report back to work and relieve Kenyans of the suffering they have undergone since the strike started. We&rsquo;ll go the extra mile to sit and talk with them,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;The issue of terminating their services should not be the only option we have. We would like to see this fiasco come to an end.&rdquo;The governor was with Health executive Hubbie Hussein.He thanked the more than 49 clinical officers and doctors in the management team for ensuring that health services, especially emergencies, were attended to.The county wrote to aid agencies requesting medical services assistance during the strike, but none of them responded to the appeal, Hussein said.She said each of the seven sub-county hospitals had at least two doctors before the strike.President Uhuru Kenyatta has maintained that the government will only negotiate with the doctors if they call off the strike.Doctors have agreed to go back to work if the return-to-work formula is signed by all parties.
