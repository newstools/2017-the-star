The Trump administration said on Friday it is suspending action on an Obama administration decision in October to probe a long-time practice by some airlines of preventing various travel websites from showing their fares and whether to require transparency in airline baggage and other fees.The US Transportation Department said in a notice Friday it is suspending a public comment period on the review of the practices to "allow the president&rsquo;s appointees the opportunity to review and consider this action."Airlines generated $3.8 billion in baggage fees in 2015 and the Obama administration said in October it was formally exploring requiring airlines and ticket agents to provide consumers with prices that include service fees for baggage and other services alongside fares at points of sale.Separately, the Trump administration is also extending the compliance date for a new regulation requiring reporting of data for mishandled baggage and wheelchairs in aircraft cargo compartments for one year - until January 1, 2019.Airlines for America, the industry trade group representing American Airlines Group Inc, United Continental Holdings Inc, Southwest Airlines Co and others, praised the decision."Today&rsquo;s action is a common sense measure reinforcing that the airline industry is capable of making the decisions that best serve our customers, our employees and the communities we serve," the airlines' group chief executive Nicholas Calio said in a statement.The group added the "airline industry operates under 13,000 regulations across 13 agencies, many of which are outdated, obsolete and in need of reform."President Donald Trump met with airline chief executives last month and asked them to identify regulatory hurdles preventing job growth in the industry.A study commissioned by a travel agencies' trade group, the Travel Technology Association, in 2014 found that restricting the ability to comparison-shop would result in ticket prices increasing more than 11 percent.
