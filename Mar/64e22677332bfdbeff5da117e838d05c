I stopped suddenly in the forest near the Langata gate. In front of me near the edge of the road was a tiny animal that at first glance looked like a mouse. Then as it turned to reveal its long snouted nose and blue-silver/grey fur, I realised it was a shrew. Sitting quietly with the engine off, I watched as the shrew relaxed and began to hunt for food among the dry leaves on the ground.It should be noted that shrews are not rodents, even though they have a mouse-like body. There are estimated to be as many as 12 sub-species of forest shrews in Africa. The particular species I saw in the Nairobi National Park is found in central/eastern African highland forests and parts of Kenya. It&rsquo;s called Grants forest shrew (sylvisorex granti, from the Latin &lsquo;silva - forest&rsquo; and &lsquo;sorex - shrew&rsquo;) and named after the Scottish ornithologist and explorer William Robert Ogilivie-Grant, who scientifically classified the species in 1907. Forest Shrews are carnivorous and eat continually as they have a high metabolic rate. They have sharp, spiky teeth, and eat mainly insects. So they are therefore not vermin and do much good in their forest environment. Due to massive deforestation in recent years, they are now classified as threatened on the IUCN red data list.This was a rare sighting. With over 4,500 visits to the park over many years, this was my first and only sighting of Grants forest shrew.So next time you are in the park, how about taking a slow drive through the forest section?It is very enjoyable and rewarding to drive slowly and observe as the hidden treasures of the forest such as Grants shrew and many others are revealed. The park is open daily from 06h00 to 19h00 .For more information on the park you can link to the following websites www.kws.org or www.nairobigreenline.com or on Facebook &ndash; Nairobi National Park
