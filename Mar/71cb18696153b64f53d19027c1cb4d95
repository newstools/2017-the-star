Auditor general Edward Ouko has sued President Uhuru Kenyatta and National Assembly seeking to block his removal from office over graft allegations.Ouko has moved to court under a certificate of urgency and wants decision of Speaker and Clerk of National Assembly to commit petition seeking his removal before parliament departmental committee be quashed.The embattled Auditor general was being investigated in relations to a Sh100 million tender. Ethics and Anti Corruption Commission had recommended that he be charged but the Director of Public Prosecution cleared Ouko.Yesterday Ouko further asked the high court to restrain the Speaker and the National Assembly from debating the petition seeking his removal from office.Ouko is further seeking to prohibit forwarding of any recommendations to the head of state for constitution of tribunal to investigate him.He also wants court to bar the President from acting on recommendations of parliament.He based his application on grounds that the petition for his removal is flawed and inadmissible. It contravenes the national assembly standing orders, he argues.The process of his removal is also unlawful and unfair as it denies him fair administrative action and access to information, he said.According to Ouko he wasn't give sufficient time to defend himself.The auditor general contends that he was never told who his accusers were and neither was he told the nature of allegations he was facing."The committee failed to observe the applicant's (Ouko's) to cross examine the accuser thereby flouting the provisions of sections 4(3) and 4(4) c of the fair administrative action act," read the suit papers in part.Through lawyer Otiende Amollo the auditor general said that the house committee shifted the burden of proof contrary to principle that he who alleges must proof.He says he is apprehensive that the committee might forward a recommendation to the President who will immediately suspend him.Ouko claims that a petition aimed at removing state officer must allege unequivocally that the officer had conducted serious violations and in his case what was brought before parliament was just glib and most fundamentally did not allege serious violations.He holds the view that National Assembly lacks jurisdiction to entertain allegations of criminal nature which the director of public prosecution has pronounced himself with finality.
