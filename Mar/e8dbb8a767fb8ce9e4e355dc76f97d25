On Sunday rancher Tristan Voorspuy was shot dead by armed pastoralists as he investigated a burnt down building on his Sosian ranch.The Samburu and Pokot pastoralists are not just seeking pasture during the drought, but want to permanently evict ranchers from north-west Laikipia. Why else would they destroy property and gun down local residents, including small farmers?The invasion of Laikipia by at least 130,000 cattle and 10,000 herders has been going on for six months.In October Cabinet ordered the immediate eviction of pastoralists from Laikipia. It has not happened. Yesterday the police at Sosian even said it was too dangerous to collect Voorspuy&rsquo;s body using two armoured cars.Deputy President William Ruto has now sent 750 police reservists to Baringo to restore order. That is a good step but more needs to be done.President Kenyatta needs to order out the army to restore order all across northern Kenya - from Kerio and Laikipia right across to Kitui and Tsavo.Quote of the day: "I tend to admire dead people more than the living.
