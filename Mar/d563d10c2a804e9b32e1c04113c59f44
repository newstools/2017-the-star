On-form Homeboyz RFC welcome champions Kabras at Jamhuri Show ground in the weekend&rsquo;s standout Kenya Cup tie at 4pm.The two clubs are separated by two points on the log with Homeboyz third on 47 points while Kabras is joint fourth with Impala on 45 points.The deejays are unbeaten since the start of the year and will fancy their chances against the holders, who are notoriously poor travellers from their fortress in Kakamega.Host coach Paul Murunga expects a tough clash against the champions. &ldquo;This will be a difficult match since both teams are playing well currently and it may boil down to who controls the game and makes less mistakes in the course of the 80 minutes,&rdquo; said Murunga.Murunga will be without top try scorer Collins Shikoli who has a slight knock in the ankle and will be repalced on the wing by Cyprian Kuto.Prop Thomas Okidia drops to the bench for Dennis Mukabi and so is lock Wallace Odhiambo for Andrew Chogo who has had a fantastic season.Charles Omondi, who ruptured knee ligaments during last year&rsquo;s Christie Sevens, has made full recovery and will start on the bench.Captain Emmanuel Mavala, Steve &lsquo;Security&rsquo; Otieno and Phillip Ikambili will be the key players upfront with scrumhalf Kelvin Masai, Alvine Otieno and Max Kangeri starting at the back.On their part, Kabras will rely on Nick Barasa, Brian Tanga, Phillip Wokorach and Jone Kubu in the backs with Hillary Mwanjilwa, George Otieno and Duncan Mwangi in the forwards.In other fixtures, Resolution Impala Saracens travel to face Nakuru at the latter&rsquo;s backyard with the top of the table KCB hosting Nondies at the Lions Den in Ruaraka.Mean Machine host second-placed Quins at the UON grounds.
