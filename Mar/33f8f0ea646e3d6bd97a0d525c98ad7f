Lamu county commissioner Joseph Kanyiri (pictured) has warned politicians and residents against using children in demonstrations. He said &ldquo;harsh&rdquo; legal action will be taken against anyone found engaging students in such actions.Kanyiri on Thursday said it had come to his attention that primary and secondary students are being used to in demonstrations. He spoke in his Lamu office. Kanyiri cited an incident earlier in the day in which squatters from Poromoko and Majembeni used nursery school children to barricade roads.More than 600 squatters took to the streets to protest against alleged oppression by ranchers and landowners.The squatters accused chiefs of colluding with the landowners to dupe them. &ldquo;Supposing something happened and the kids got injured? Supposing such demos turned rowdy, what would have happened to such kids who can&rsquo;t even run or defend themselves?&rdquo; Kanyiri asked. He said they are investigating and will soon apprehend those behind the demonstration. Kanyiri also warned politicians not engage schoolchildren in demonstrations or campaign rallies, saying they will be punished.
