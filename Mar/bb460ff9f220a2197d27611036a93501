Former Energy minister Chris Okemo and ex-Kenya Power and Lighting Company MD Samuel Gichuru had earlier put up a spirited fight to block their extradition to the British island of Jersey to face charges of money laundering.In May 2011, then Attorney General Amos Wako submitted extradition requests from the UK to the Director of Public Prosecutions to have the two handed over to Jersey authorities for laundering about Sh900 million.However, the two raised objections before the magistrate&rsquo;s court, saying their intended extradition was improper as the DPP lacks powers to authorise the move.After hearing lengthy submissions from parties, the court dismissed their arguments and ordered the extradition request be heard in full.But the two, through their lawyer Fred Ngatia, moved to the High Court arguing that there was no legal basis to extradite them to Jersey Island.Ngatia said the extradition proceedings against the two should come to an end in the absence of the authority of the AG. They argued that it was unreasonable for them to be prosecuted for offences committed more than 20 years ago.The lawyer said the proceedings were fatally defective because the DPP was constitutionally challenged to commence trial against the two.In 2015, Justice Isaac Lenaola dismissed their plea saying the matter was properly before the magistrate&rsquo;s court and the duo can have their grievances heard and determined by the same court.The judge said the DPP was within the law in instituting the extradition proceedings against Okemo and Gichuru, adding that their rights had not been violated.And in February 2016 the two lost their money after authorities in Jersey Island confiscated them.Okemo served as Kenya&rsquo;s energy minister from 1999 until 2001, and as finance minister until 2003. Both men are accused of storing illegally earned money &mdash; including bribes and misappropriated public funds &mdash; in British bank accounts.Yesterday, Kenya and Jersey Island signed an agreement to return the cash stashed in the island. The Sh380 million is suspected to be proceeds of corruption.
