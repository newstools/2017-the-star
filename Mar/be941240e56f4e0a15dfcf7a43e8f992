Kenya Power's credit exposure is approaching alarming levels triggered by a huge increase in electricity bills which are yet to be cleared.This has forced the utility firm to undertake an intensified meter reading campaign to urge customers to pay outstanding bills which currently amount to billions.&ldquo;We appeal to members of the public to settle their outstanding bills at Kenya Power banking halls, appointed banks, mobile money service providers and Easy Pay partners,&rdquo; it said in a statement on Friday, noting customer should be cautious of fraudsters who are taking advantage of the exercise to solicit for bribes.The company's corporate communications manager Johnstone Ole Turana could not say exactly what they are owed by customers currently, noting that this would be known after the meter reading exercise is completed.&ldquo;We can neither say we have a credit exposure,&rdquo; he said in a telephone interview.A company that has exposure to credit risk bears the risk that a counter party might be unable to pay debt in full when its due.For Kenya Power, credit risk mainly arises from electricity receivables.The main classes of electricity receivables are industrial, government ministries, local authorities, parastatals, commercial and domestic customers.Disclosures published by Kenya Power in its annual report indicate the total amount of outstanding bills stood at Sh32.75 billion as at June 2016.These included electricity receivables amounting to Sh15.16 billion which were neither past due or impaired, in addition to Sh13.34 billion outstanding and impaired bills for over 90 days and another Sh4.24 billion which was impaired for over a year.Past due amounts are those beyond the maximum established credit period and represents slow but paying customers.The report shows the fair value of the collateral held by the Kenya Power as security and other credit enhancements amounted to Sh7.49 billion last year compared to Sh7.60 billion in 2015.Kenya Power says all customers are required to deposit an amount equivalent to two times their monthly consumption being security in the form of a cash deposit depending on the load supplied.&ldquo;The receivable balance continues to be serviced even though this is not done on the contractual dates. Treasury and finance departments are actively following up on these receivables. In addition, the company holds deposits or a bank guarantee, depending on the electricity load supplied which acts as collateral,&rdquo; Kenya Power said.
