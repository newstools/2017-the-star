Chief Justice David Maraga has blasted MPs following plans to slash the Judiciary budget by Sh200 million.Maraga said they viewed the plan as an attempt by the legislators to "punish" the courts for extending mass voter registration beyond the February 14 deadline.The extension by Justice Chacha Mwita granted the electoral commission five more days for the exercise.This followed a successful petition filed by activist Okiya Omtatah against the IEBC.Maraga said on Thursday that slashing the budget will only be a punishment to the electorate.The courts will be greatly crippled if starved of cash, he noted when he officially closed the second annual legislative summit in Mombasa."Who do you want to punish? It is your people. You will hamper delivery of justice," he said.Read: Judiciary to lose Sh200m to IEBC for longer voter listingAlso read: Parliament to amend budget to deny judiciary development fundsMaraga further rebuked politicians castigating the Judiciary for issuing orders against the national and county assemblies.He said the Judiciary cannot stop or interfere with Parliament or the Executive unless there is a quasi-judicial function."At times I am surprised because the statements have been issued by lawyers," he said.He noted that Article 165 of the Constitution gives the High Court powers to intervene when the due process on legislation or impeachment is not followed.In December, Majority leader Aden Duale threatened to table a motion in Parliament to discuss Justice George Odunga.This followed Cord's application to stop Parliament from debating amendments to election laws.Duale said then: "And I want to tell one judge Odunga that when we open on January 24, I will introduce a motion to discuss you. We will expose you. You cannot be a member of the bench and play tribal politics."Regarding cases filed against county assemblies, Maraga said they are always prioritised by the courts so that services are not disrupted.The CJ further said the Judiciary has resolved to deal with hate speech cases firmly and decisively.He urged NCIC chairman Francis ole Kaparo to ensure evidence is gathered to build strong cases and ensure those found guilty are jailed.Maraga also asked police to provide evidence for matters in court. He said judges should not be blamed for the rulings they make when evidence is lackign.The Chief Justice said all disputes that might arise during the August 8 election will be handled within stipulated timelines.Concerning whether MCAs will get severance apackages, Maraga said they should wait for a determination on April 18.
