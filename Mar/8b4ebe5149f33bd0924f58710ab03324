The government is unlikely to provide alternative routes for motorists who cannot afford road user fees in a planned multi-billion-shilling road tolling programme on five major highways, it emerged yesterday.Director of Public Privater Partnerships Unit at the National Treasury Stanley Kamau said the tolling policy, which has been approved by the Cabinet, does provide for alternative freeways.In a development that could elicit a constitutional debate on free movement, Kamau said the targeted highways do not have enough space for building alternative routes, among other challenges. The targeted highways include Nairobi&rsquo;s Southern by-pass, Nairobi-Nakuru highway, Nairobi-Mombasa and Thika Superhighway.Kamau insisted that road user fees, which were introduced in early 1980s but scrapped in mid 1990s in favour of Road Maintenance Levy, would bring back predictability on roads by eliminating traffic jams.&ldquo;Where there are no free alternatives, we need to discuss with them (key stakeholders) and agree what are the benefits we are going to get from this process because it is the benefits that we are going to going to sell,&rdquo; he said during an infrastructure financing forum in Nairobi. &ldquo;There is need to bring predictability on our roads and predictability means we are managing that road in a sustainable way, managing traffic, adding more lanes&hellip; and that has a cost implication.&rdquo;Motorists already pay Sh18 per litre of diesel and kerosene for road maintenance, with Sh3 of that going into 10,000 annuity road fund. The annuity fund has accumulated about Sh20 billion since it was introduced in the financial year 2015-16, Kamau said.The proposed road tolling programme gathered steam last month when the Kenya National Highways Authority prequalified 10 firms for expansion of the 175 kilometre road from Rironi to Mau Summit into a four-lane dual carriageway highway. The successful concessionaire will also take over the Southern by-pass, head of PPP division at at Kenya National Highways Authority George Kiiru said.&ldquo;The biggest concern for investors that the toll fund has to be established by the time these projects are ready for signing,&rdquo; KPMG head of infrastructure for Africa James Woodward said. &ldquo;So if you do not have the fund ready by that time, then you can end up with a gap and that gap is not necessarily tenable by the investors. &rdquo;
