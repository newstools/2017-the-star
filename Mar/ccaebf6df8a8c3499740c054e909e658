At least four of the National Olympic Committee of Kenya officials will not be defending their seats come the eagerly awaited May 5 elections.Long serving treasurer, Fridah Shiroya is among the four, who have thrown in the towel and will not be defending their seats.Others are Nock second vice chairman, Pius Ochieng and executive committee members, Anne Njambi and Resham Bains.Their exit leaves current president, Kipchoge Keino, first vice chairman Ben Ekumbo, secretary FK Paul, assistant treasurer, Stephen Soi and assistant secretary James Chacha as those likely to go for a stab at the elections. Also to vie for various positions are Paul Tergat, who is also an IOC member, athletes&rsquo; representative Catherine Loroupe and member Tegla Loroupe.In an interview, Ochieng said he is happy to have served his term as vice chairman and welcomed the passing of the new constitution. &ldquo;I have been in sports management for a long period and I am happy to call it a day,&rdquo; said Ochieng, who was elected in Nock in 2013.Ochieng said the passing of the new constitution and stripping the executive committee the voting power will create a level playing field for the contestants.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy that the new document was passed. It will be a game changer come the elections because everyone now must look for votes from the federations and affiliates,&rdquo; added Ochieng.Shiroya said she will now concentrate on her role as the national chairperson of the Kenya Softball Federation. &ldquo;I made my decision last year when we came from Rio and so I will not defend my seat. I wish the organisation well going forward with the new constitution,&rdquo; she added.Njambi has also declined to seek re-election as an executive member. &ldquo;It has been a tough challenge at Nock and I made my mind long time ago to serve one term and not seek re-election,&rdquo; added Njambi.Sources familiar with the intrigues at Nock said legendaru Tergat, who is also the five-time cross country champion, is tipped to take over Nock as the president. The sources said the election of Tergat as Nock boss will no doubt save face for incumbent, Kipchoge Keino, who is seeking another term. &ldquo;Kipchoge is fresh from winning a major Laureus award in Rio and should now pass over the baton after a well done job,&rdquo; the source hinted.Stakeholders and the affiliates believe Tergat is a principled man, who will bring breath of fresh air to Nock and can be trusted with the leadership of the organisation.The source noted that by virtue of Tergat being the IOC member, the country will be making a big blunder to entrust any other official with the leadership of Nock.&ldquo; In case of anything IOC can only hold Tergat responsible by virtue of being their member. So why not give him the mantle?&rdquo; the sourced asked.The source revealed that Athletics Kenya&rsquo;s president Lt (Rtd) Jackson Tuwei would be making a big mistake to vie for Nock top job as he holds an equally senior position at AK and he is just settling in. &ldquo;All Tuwei needs to do is to front someone from AK to be part of Nock because he has quite a lot on his hands as the leader of the successful athletics body,&rdquo; the source noted.The source divulged that the some affiliates will be comfortable with the some of the current office bearers staying in office like secretary FK Paul to safeguard the intellectual memory and relationships they have had with IOC over the years. Kenya Table Tennis Association (KTTA) chairman Andrew Mudibo has thrown his hat into the ring for the position of Secretary General with Kenya Hockey Union (KHU) vice chairman, Elynah Shiveka, eyeing the treasurer&rsquo;s seat.However, the source warned delagates to be wary of officials, who run their associations from the briefcases and want to take advantage of the current confusion to sneak into Nock. &ldquo; As we seek to push out the current officials, we need to look for officials who are up to the challenge to take over Nock. Not everyone who was not in Nock leadership can lead Nock.&rdquo;
