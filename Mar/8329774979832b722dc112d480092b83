After the shock of their opening day loss at home to Western Stima has subsided, coach Henry Omino has vowed that his charges will bounce back in their difficult second league fixture at home to current league leaders Gor Mahia on Sunday.Stima slumped to an unexpected 3-1 loss at home to Sofapaka but Omino was quick to point out that the result was a blip that they would rectify in due course.&ldquo;Of course we were disappointed by the outcome of the match on Sunday. But we made many mistakes and conceded many free kicks and Sofapaka capitalised on that. We have been working on the errors that we made and hopefully on Sunday, we will see a very different side,&rdquo; Omino promised.Experienced attacker Charles Okwemba scored the opening goal for Sofapaka midway through the first half before Humphrey Okoti doubled the lead five minutes to the break. Fredrick Nyarombo pulled a goal back for Stima minutes later as they looked to mount a comeback only for Ezekiel Okare&rsquo;s strike to end the affair as a contest with Sofapaka&rsquo;s third goal.Stima resumed training yesterday and Omino said it was important that they recover quickly from the disappointment of their weekend loss or they would be on the end of another unwanted result. &ldquo;We have a very tough match against Gor and yesterday we were working on our recovery to ensure the players are in good physical and mental condition for our next game,&rdquo; offered the coach.The experienced tactician while refusing to hang on it as an excuse also lamented the late start to their season as a key factor in last Sunday&rsquo;s loss.&ldquo;It was obvious that our opponents (Sofapaka) were match fit compared to us. Their reaction was quicker while we struggled on the second balls. The late start to the season has in some way disoriented us but we are confident that as the season goes by, we will improve,&rdquo; Omino explained.Against the record, league winners Stima will be without goalkeeper Samuel &lsquo;Abawa&rsquo; odhiambo, who was sent off for handling the ball outside the area.While the rest of the teams in the now expanded 18-team SportPesa Premier League have played two matches each, Stima, Kakamega Homeboyz, AFC Leopards and Ulinzi Stars have only one game to their name.
