Former Central Imenti MP Gitobu Imanyara has joined the Maendeleo Chap Chap. He said he consulted widely before joining the party. Imanyara received Njuri Ncheke on Monday at his home in Mariene, Central Imenti, who blessed him and dressed him in traditional regalia. "I had retired from politics, but I was called by the elders and residents who told me that development projects have stalled. They asked me to make a comeback in politics," he said.
