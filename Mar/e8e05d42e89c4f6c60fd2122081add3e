Embu residents should elect leaders based on their qualities and ability to develop the county, and not on political party affiliation, Deputy Speaker Ibrahim Swaleh has said.But he also urged them vote for individuals or parties that support President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto.Swaleh said some good leaders who support Uhuru have defected to other parties, fearing unfair JP nominations. They should be chosen as leaders if the residents feel they can bring development, he said.The Kirimari MCA was elected on the TNA ticket in 2013 and he wants to run for reelection on the Jubilee Party ticket. It will be wrong for us to mislead residents that voting in the 'suit pattern' is important. In today s era what we should know is that our President is Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy is William Ruto. But if there is a leader who is supporting President Kenyatta, it does not matter what party he belongs to, as parties are vehicles to take us to the ballot box and offices we want, Swaleh said.He urged residents to reelect the President, as he has fulfilled most of his pre-election pledges.Swaleh spoke at the Embu Talent Academy when he presided over issuance of Sh12 million bursaries for 1,354 students in the ward.
