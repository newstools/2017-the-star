Over 100 guests gathered at Australian High Commissioner John Feakes&rsquo;s residence to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Australian Education Consultants (AEC). Gracing the colourful ceremony were dignitaries, alumni of various Australian universities, and representatives from 23 Australian institutions participating in the 17th edition of the Australian Higher Education Fair. The expo was running between March 1 and March 7 in Mombasa, Nairobi, Nakuru and Eldoret counties. AEC director Mahul Shah said: &ldquo;In the past 20 years, more than 10,000 Kenyans have been guided to travel to study in Australia to achieve their dreams through Australian Education Consultants. Enrolling in quality education has allowed these students into employment and achieving great things for them and their families.&rdquo;
