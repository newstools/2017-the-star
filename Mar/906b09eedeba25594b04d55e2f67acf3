In the world of film remakes, the successor is often thwarted by the discontented comparisons to the predecessor. The same can be said of the remake of the 1991 Disney animated film Beauty and the Beast. Although most of the film&rsquo;s cast was live characters, the film still heavily relied on CGI as it unravels the mysterious romance of a sweet Belle and a mighty beast. Bill Condon does a great job of maintaining the iconic shots, such as the magnificent waltz in the grand ballroom. Emma Watson did not &lsquo;play&rsquo; her character; she was in fact the embodiment of Belle. Star Rating: 4/5
