Saboti MP Alfred Agoi has cautioned against disposing of the mobile clinics at the centre of the Afya House scandal.He said the containers will act as exhibits in a case over a health scandal.Regional coordinator Nelson Marwa on Friday ordered 97 of the 99 containers stored at the National Youth Service in Miritini be removed.&ldquo;Only two should be left here for the rehab. I don&rsquo;t care where they will be taken. I don&rsquo;t want to see them here. From next week [this week] the process of removing them should start,&rdquo; he said.One hundred fully kitted mobile clinic containers were imported in June last year for Sh1 billion to improve access to healthcare in far-flung areas. One container had been taken to Nairobi for demonstration on how they will operate.In the health scandal, top ministry officials reportedly stole more than Sh5 billion through diversion of funds, double payment for goods, and manipulation of the Ifmis. Auditors say the amount of money lost could be higher.Speaking in Mombasa on Saturday, Agoi said disposing of the containers will complicate investigations.He said a report on the probe will soon be tabled.
