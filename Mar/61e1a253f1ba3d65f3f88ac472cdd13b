Aden Duale has called for the unmasking of an Opposition politician whom he claims is part of a cartel named in attempts to hack into IEBC's systems.The National Assembly Majority leader said the person should be identified and arrested to avert plans to rig the August 8 poll."We need answers on whether the politician was also involved in the hacking of banks and whether proceeds of crime are being used to finance the individual s activities," he said in a statement on Saturday.The National Super Alliance has expressed doubt the IEBC can deliver an honest General Election and raised fears the data centre could be hacked.It said the polls stand impugned, the timelines breached, the voter register polluted and without a credible independent audit.In an eight-page letter dated February 20, NASA says the August 8 polls could be legally compromised even before they are held.More on this: NASA fears hacking of poll databaseBut Duale, who is also Garissa Town MP said: "All the noise about rigging was meant to divert attention to hoodwink Kenyans to look the other way when they were the busy attempting to interfere with the election."He asked for a full investigation by relevant parliamentary committees and the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission"This is not the first time individuals in Cord, and now Nasa, have attempted shortcuts to get power. Nothing can be more bizarre and criminal than attempting to subvert democracy to suit a few power-hungry individuals, he said.This was after more suspects were arrested by the Flying Squad over the banks hacking scandal that led to the loss of hundred of millions of shillings. Some of them named prominent Kenyans.NASA chiefs are demanding answers in 11 areas involving security and integrity of the IEBC data centre, including any external connections to critical electoral database and servers.The allegation of server security rekindles memories of the 2013 polls when Cord alleged that President Uhuru Kenyatta's TNA hacked the results transmission system.IEBC has not answered the questions but it said, following the theft of BVR kits in Mandera county, that their data cannot be affected.
