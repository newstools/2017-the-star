MCAs were left frustrated yesterday after they were given no clear response on their promised car grants and whether they will leave office on March 4 next year. President Uhuru Keyatta’s speech, read by Devolution CS Mwangi Kiunjuri did not touch on the car grant. Uhuru, during the first Annual Legislative Summit, promised the MCAs grants, saying they should be accorded equal treatment with MPs. National Assembly members are given grants, instead of loans, to buy vehicles, as recommended by the Salaries and Remuneration Commission. Kiunjuri’s calls to have a team formed to negotiate with Uhuru through him were trashed. He instead urged MCAs to have laws and regulations in place to ensure they do not miss the grants, their successors will benefit. He was heckled. “I want to remind the President that members are still in office and we shall be looking for away to communicate this,” Kiunjuri said. The MCAs vowed to campaign against the President for failing to honour the promise. Kiunjuri wants the court to rule on the election dates so MCAs can know their fate.
