Embattled Auditor General Edward Ouko yesterday received the backing of civil society regarding a petition seeking his removal from office.The groups told the National Assembly Finance committee chaired by Benjamin Langat (Ainamoi) inquiring into the petition that the claims against Ouko are &ldquo;vexatious and cannot be substantiated&rdquo;.Transparency International Kenya executive director Samuel Kimeu said, &ldquo;The petition falls short of constitutional and legal standards regulating fair administrative practice and the removal of public officers. It is, therefore, a waste of parliamentary attention and valuable public resources.&rdquo;Other groups present included the Society for International Development led by associate director Irungu Houghton, Mzalendo Trust, Inuka Kenya Ni Sisi! Ltd and Organisation for Development and Empowerment.&ldquo;The petition further seeks to disable an important constitutionally mandated oversight office vital for upholding integrity and the fight against corruption. The committee is advised to dismiss the petition in the public interest,&rdquo; Irungu said.Petitioner Emmanuel Mwagambo wants Parliament to recommend to President Uhuru Kenyatta that he forms a tribunal to probe Ouko&rsquo;s conduct on claims of violating the Constitution by failing to submit reports to the Head of State and the House.Mwagambo alleges the auditor has failed to prevent massive waste of public funds, propagated nepotism in staff hiring at his office and wants him held accountable for violating the procurement laws.He further wants Ouko kicked out for procuring regional offices in Mombasa, which were unoccupied for one year despite spending Sh10 million in rent from public coffers and allowing a fictitious office partitioning contract amounting to Sh25 million. He also cites inflation of audit software from Sh18 million to Sh100 million.But the civil rights groups said Mwagambo could not establish ouster grounds and failed to furnish the committee with evidence to remove Ouko from office.They took Mwagambo to task, questioning if he was the owner of the petition or was a gun for hire to push the agenda of certain individuals following his Tuesday submission.The groups questioned the petitioner&rsquo;s motive, yet the EACC and the DPP cleared Ouko of all charges after intensive probes. Kimeu said, &ldquo;How can the committee be sure this petition is not motivated by a person or persons that have been adversely audited or have a conflict of interest?&rdquo;
