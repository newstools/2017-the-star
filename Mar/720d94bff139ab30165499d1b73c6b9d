Garissa Township MP hopeful and ODM member Nassir Dolal has dismissed a rival who said his endorsement by party leader Raila Odinga is inconsequential.&ldquo;It is an open secret that I am the strongest candidate to beat [incumbent Aden] Duale. I lost the race in a suspicious manner in 2013. I will win the seat, regardless of which party&rsquo;s ticket I run on ,&rdquo; he said.Dolal was reacting to former National Assembly Deputy Speaker Farah Maalim&rsquo;s statement he is not worried by ODM&rsquo;s move to field a candidate to run against him. Maalim moved from ODM to Wiper last month in a move viewed as a way of targetting the Kamba voters in Garissa Township. There has been tension around whether NASA will field a single candidate for posts, or each member party will present a hopeful.Dolal said, &ldquo;Politics is a game of numbers and my sub-clan are the majority in Garissa Township.&rdquo;Farah&rsquo;s sub-clan is predominantly found in Dadaab. Both candidates come from the larger Aulian clan.Dolal said, &ldquo;ODM is the party to beat in Garissa Township because it enjoys massive support. Out of the four MCAs, three were elected on the ODM ticket in 2013.&rdquo;On joint nominations being pushed for by a section of leaders from NASA strongholds, Dolal said he would not participate in the process because Maalim is a member of the technical committee. Maalim represents Wiper in the panel.
