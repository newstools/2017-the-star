The Laikipia Farmers&rsquo; Association yesterday dismissed claims some ranches and conservancies are obstructing security operations to flush out invading herders and bandits.The claims, which circulated on social media, said they encourage shooting cattle in the north and west of the county. But chairman Martin Evans said the association fully supports ongoing state-backed operations to restore order and the rule of law.More than 30 people have been killed in six months. Hundreds more have suffered loss of livelihood and been displaced. Herders from outside Laikipia have driven more than 200,000 cattle, sheep, and goats into the county in search of pasture and water during the drought. They have violently invaded land, destroyed property, stolen livestock, slaughtered and poached wildlife and retaliated with armed force when confronted. Police and KDF officers are in charge of the operations.In a statement, Evans said the government is free to enlist their help should it deem necessary.LFA represents private investors, community group ranches, land owners, property managers and businesses operating 58 enterprises.It employs about 4,000 people. It injects Sh4 billion into the economy, spends Sh500 million on social development projects and draws significant foreign direct investment annually.&ldquo;The relevant command hierarchies of these security agencies direct the actions of all officers who take part in these operations. The LFA has absolutely no influence or voice in their planning or execution, and anyone suggesting the contrary is spreading falsehood,&rdquo; Evans said.&ldquo;No one in the LFA would condone the action we&rsquo;re being accused of. Our members &mdash; along with Laikipia pastoralists, smallholder farmers, wildlife and business community &mdash; are victims of the crisis, not its instigators.&rdquo;
