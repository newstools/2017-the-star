Kenya Police men and Orange Telkom women s teams headline this weekend s fixtures as 2017 Kenya Hockey Union league gets underway today at the City Park Stadium.Orange begin their title defence against Chase Amiras in the women category today while 2013 men s premier league champions Police battle Kenya College Accountancy University tomorrow. Orange welcome back former team-mate Betsy Omalla having missed the better part of the last season due to personal commitment.The last time the two sides met, Orange won 4-0. However, coach Jos Openda is aware it might not be business as usual and complacency is bound to cost them heavily.Openda said their opponents in today s match have had a massive recruitment ahead of the season hence they will give the tie the seriousness it deserves,. Last season, we didn t live up to our objective of not conceding a goal in the season as we ended up conceding two goals against Strathmore University. We have set the same objective again this season and we are determined to fulfill it this time round, said the tactician.He added: It s always good to start on a high. The players are still in a competition mood having won the Africa Club Championship title for the ninth time recently, he said.The law enforcers, who settled for third place behind Butali Sugar and overall winner Strathmore University last season, will also be seeking to start on a high. The side, coached by Kenneth Kaunda, will be buoyed by their second finish in the Club Championship, where they succumbed to eventual winner Eastern Company of Egypt.
