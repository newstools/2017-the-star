Tharaka Nithi governor hopeful Muthomi Njuki has named Francis Kagwima
as his running mate. He made the announcement at the launch of his manifesto on Friday in Nyangumi Stadium, Marimanti town, Tharaka constituency. The event was attended by more than 5,000 residents. Njuki is the current Chuka Igambang’ombe MP. He had been hesitant to name a running mate before finally choosing Kagwima, former Tharaka MP, out of four potential candidates from Tharaka. In his manifesto Njuki says he will automate revenue collection within first 100 days to reduce pilferage and increase collection. He pledges to reduce licence fees for boda boda operators and stock all health centres with quality drugs. Njuki said he will re-engineer Nithi Bridge, provide ample water to Kathwana, the county headquarters, and move the county administration, including the governor’s residence, to Kathwana. The announcement of the choice of running mate was filled with suspense. Njuki arrived at the stadium alone, while Kagwima was in the nearby Baobab hotel. Njuki then went on read his manifesto, and it was at this time that Kagwima came into the venue unnoticed. When he was done reading his manifesto, Njuki turned to the crowd and said, "all this will not be accomplished without a running mate". He then called Kagwima’s wife to the podium and told the crowd, “this is my running mate [do you think] she is capable?” “[But] this is john the Baptist, I want to unveil the real messiah,” he said, and announced Kagwima's name as the crowd cheered. According to the manifesto, a new effective scheme of service for health workers, ECDE teachers and youth polytechnic instructors will be introduced. Njuki pledged to establish a welfare kitty for people with disability; launch an investment drive; operationalise cereal depots at Mitheru and Mukuuni and initiate construction of a new one at Marimanti and Mukothima; as well as launch agriculture and trade fairs.
