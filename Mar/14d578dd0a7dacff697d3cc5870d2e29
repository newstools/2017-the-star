The Lands ministry will partner with international donors to ensure the digitisation of its registries is completed this year.Lands CS Jacob Kaimenyi said they are at an advanced stage and by the end of June, they will have digitised 18 registries. The digitisation of land records is aimed at improving efficiency, taming corruption and eliminating cases of missing files.It will also improve monitoring and control of cartels that pose the biggest danger in the war on land grabbing.He said the drive will require billions of shillings as the country has about 57 registries.&ldquo;This exercise will cost us a lot of money, I cannot estimate as yet, but within less than a year we should have finished digitising the registries countrywide. It will definitely make our services more efficient, effective and retrieval of information will become easier,&rdquo; Kaimenyi said.The ministry has also introduced biometric access control cards that will eventually be spread out to all land registries.The amendment of the Valuers Act is also another reform measure within the ministry.Kaimenyi said there are many brokers masquerading as land valuers, who end up robbing Kenyans of their hard-earned money.&ldquo;This idea of people selling land in a foreign country needs to stop. It should be done by professionals, not quacks. We shall deal with them because the country only recognises 318 registered land valuers,&rdquo; Kaimenyi said.He spoke during a ceremony to award a Presidential honour to Dr Pankaj Patel on Wednesday in his office.In July last year, the ministry carried out a similar process across 13 land registries.The land registries digitised are in Mombasa, Kilifi, Kwale, Machakos, Kajiado, Nakuru, Kisumu, Eldoret, Bungoma, Meru, Thika, Kiambu and at Ardhi House in Nairobi.
