It is often difficult to come across a well-made piece of art that is spiritual, entertaining, with great social and moral impact. In today&rsquo;s day and age with several distractions of all sorts, a spiritual and moral ray of light is extremely vital. Morality is often questioned and decided by several factors. But one constant factor that forms the sub-structure of this belief is humanity.The source of humanity can be anything, inspirational art, motivational words, a simple action or a spiritual well-being. Many run away from the concept of spirituality, some find it absurd, some find it untruthful and some find it unnerving. On the contrary, majority find it peaceful, some make it their foundation, and for some, it&rsquo;s a way of life. Several case studies and journal articles have proven that the right amount of spirituality induced in one&rsquo;s day-to-day life enables one to be a better person for yourself and the world at large. A spiritual piece of art that&rsquo;s an example of unprecedented human spirit is a film called Mystic India. This story of Indian culture, it&rsquo;s people and spirituality, is told through the 12,000km barefoot journey throughout 18th century India undertaken by the Hindu adolescent ascetic Nilkanth, later known in life as Lord Swaminarayan. Through his journey, we visit majestic mountains, dense forests, mighty rivers, fertile plains and peaceful coastlines of India. Through this story, we discover India as a mystic land of silent spirituality. Spirituality that changed millions of lives and still does, and plants a vital seed of humanity in the consciousness of several. The film is directed by Keith Melton and produced by BAPS Charities.
