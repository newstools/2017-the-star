Kamukunji MP Yusuf Hassan says Senator Mike Sonko is not mature enough to be governor and Peter Kenneth is a much better candidate.&ldquo;There is a reason why all city leaders support Kenneth. It&rsquo;s because Sonko and his group are not mature and are fond of hooliganism,&rdquo; he said on Sunday. &ldquo;Last week, they disrupted the Bomas event. You saw what happened. They are not the kind of people to be entrusted with power.&rdquo;Hassan spoke in California ward, Kamkunji, where he issued Sh24 million bursary cheques to 4,168 students. Since 2013, 17,000 students have benefitted from the bursary kitty, he said.Hassan also urged his constituents not to trust MP hopeful Simon Mbugua who is running against him. Mbugua is a former area MP. Both men seek the JP ticket.Hassan said during Mbugua&rsquo;s tenure, several public utilities, including land designated for a chief&rsquo;s camp, were sold and school land grabbed.&ldquo;My mission is to empower residents. My vision is to ensure all students get quality education.&rdquo;
