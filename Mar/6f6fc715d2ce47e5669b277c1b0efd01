The Kenyan private sector growth recorded nearly zero growth last month, a business survey released yesterday shows , signaling the impact of a prolonged drought and a continued credit squeeze by banks.The Stanbic Bank's Markit Purchasing Manager&rsquo;s Index posted its lowest reading since the inception of the series in January 2014.The index posted a reading of 50.1 in February, down from 52.0 in January, the lowest seen over 38 months of data collection.&ldquo;As we pointed out in our previous report, the ongoing drought and decline in private sector credit access will inevitably lead to deterioration in business conditions within the Kenyan private sector. This month&rsquo;s historic low reading is symptomatic of the risks that we are flagging,&rdquo; said Jibran Qureishi, regional economist at Stanbic Bank.&ldquo;In addition, potentially higher input costs over the coming months could also hinder the private sectors progress. More importantly, the long rains season beginning in March will be pivotal for the agricultural sector, and in the event that the rains are inadequate, we may potentially see an entrenched slowdown within the business operating environment,&rdquo; he said.According to the survey, there was a marginal drop in output while growth in new orders eased to the second-weakest in history.Employment increased only fractionally, which contributed to a further rise in backlogs of work.Firms raised their input buying at a modest pace to cater for an increased volume of new orders.Output charges rose slightly, reflecting efforts by some firms to stimulate demand despite a further increase in input costs.The fall in the PMI index was partly driven by reduced output, Stanbic said, which declined for the first time since the inception of the survey in January 2014.Fewer than expected sales and cash shortages among clients were cited as the key reasons behind lower output.Data indicated that growth of new business eased to a 17-month low.On the prices front, output charge inflation eased to a four-month low.&ldquo;Greater market prices for raw materials were reported to have driven input costs higher, while staff costs also rose in February,&rdquo; Stanbic noted.
