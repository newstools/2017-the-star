On Friday morning a lady by the name Mellen Musinya surprised many on Radio Jambo when&nbsp;she revealed that she locked herself up in a toilet, knelt and prayed for CORD leader Raila Odinga upon receiving news that he had been taken ill as a result of food poisoning on Wednesday.Mr. Odinga was&nbsp;rushed to Nairobi&rsquo;s Karen Hospital on Wednesday&nbsp;morning after complaining that he was feeling unwell.The news shook Kenyans among them Mrs. Musinya, a great admirer of the former Prime Minister who took the news with utmost shock and couldn&rsquo;t help herself but look for a safe haven, her toilet, where she knelt and interceded to God for the opposition leader.&ldquo;I am a staunch supporter&nbsp;of Raila Odinga and I was utterly shocked the moment I received the news&hellip; I was shocked and all I did was rush to my toilet, locked myself up and knelt down praying for his quick recovery. I am happy that God heard and answered my prayers.&rdquo; Said Mrs. Musinya, who hails from Lang&rsquo;ata in Nairobi, a constituency which Raila Odinga served as Member of Parliament between December 1992 and January 2013.Raila has since sent a heart-warming thank you note to Kenyans after his recovery.&ldquo;I wish to sincerely thank Kenyans for the prayers, messages of solidarity, sympathy, love and support on learning of my brief hospitalization yesterday.Those prayers and messages of love have continued to flow today, many hours after I was treated and discharged. Your prayers worked. I wish to assure everyone I am fully recovered and ready to hit the road again. We thank God for that.&rdquo;&nbsp;The note reads in part.Mrs. Musinya&nbsp;was speaking to Radio Jambo breakfast presenters, Joseph Ogidi and Jacob &lsquo;Ghost&rsquo; Mulee on Friday morning.
