Zlatan Ibrahimovic is prepared to stay at Manchester United until 2019.The 35-year-old striker has set the Premier League on fire since his arrival from Paris Saint-Germain in the summer despite doubts over his staying power given his age.The Swede has a 12-month option to extend his current deal at Old Trafford, and the expectation is that he will trigger the clause at the end of the season.But sources close to Ibrahimovic insist the global icon is enjoying life under Jose Mourinho so much that he would be willing to extend his stay beyond next season.It remains to be seen whether United would be open to offering Ibrahimovic a two-year extension, which would take the forward to 37.Meanwhile, United right back Antonio Valencia believes their League Cup triumph over Southampton has boosted their belief that they have the ability to add both the Europa League and FA Cup to their trophy haul this season.United have a tricky two-legged last-16 Europa League clash against Russian side Rostov this month and they face formidable Chelsea in their FA Cup quarter-final on March 13.&ldquo;This is the mentality that we have - that trophy has given us much confidence. We are thinking about these three trophies. I think we can do it,&rdquo; said Valencia.&ldquo;We have to realise we are Manchester United and that we can go on to win these three trophies.&rdquo;Since the 2013 retirement of Alex Ferguson, who won more than 30 trophies during his 26-year spell in charge, United have managed just one major piece of silverware - the FA Cup last season - prior to Sunday&rsquo;s League Cup win.Valencia said United have come closer to recreating the &ldquo;fear factor&rdquo; they had during the Ferguson-era under current manager Jose Mourinho.&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s the same atmosphere. We have that security of playing under a top manager,&rdquo; the Ecuador international added. &ldquo;I think the fear factor we have to create ourselves, we have to put the fear into teams every time they come to Old Trafford.&rdquo;United, currently sixth in the league, host 14th-placed Bournemouth on Saturday.
