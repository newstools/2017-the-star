I rushed to her shop and found her on the ground. The attacker was still there. When he saw me enter the shop, he dropped the knife and fled through the back door,&rdquo; a carpenter who sought anonymity said.A cyber caf&eacute; attendant, only identified as Grace, said, &ldquo;I heard commotion and rushed to the scene. I found cucu [grandmother] in a pool of blood.&rdquo;It was not immediately established how much, if anything, was stolen.Traders chased after robber Raymond Mwangi, 31, who tried to hide in an uncompleted septic tank at Karau MCA Kamau Ngotho&rsquo;s residence.Police retrieved him from the tank, and had a hard time dispersing the crowd which was ready to lynch him.Police chief Mark Maside was injured in the right wrist during the fracas.At one point, the other officers wanted to shoot in the air to disperse the crowd, but Masinde convinced them otherwise.Maside convinced the mob to let the police take away the culprit.Nyandarua Central OCPD Wilson Kosgei said it not clear if Mwangi took away anything from the victim as nothing was recovered from him.He described the crime as an isolated case, adding that Ol Kalou is a safe place.&ldquo;This criminal is very daring,&rdquo; Kosgei said
