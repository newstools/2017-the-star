April rains are likely to be below average, but will still mitigate water and forage deficits, a new report says.Famine Early Warning Systems Network in the report yesterday said the short rains in some parts of the country will not help much due to the delayed March to May long rains.This, FEWS NET says, will worsen dry conditions in pastoral and marginal agricultural areas, hurt output from livestock, delay land cultivation and planting."Since households have livestock far from homesteads, and are in poor health, productivity is likely to remain below normal, limiting milk production and consumption," the report says.FEWS NET says due to low income, with few livestock for sale, food crisis is expected.Turkana, Marsabit and Garissa, Samburu, Isiolo, Mandera, Wajir, Tana River, Baringo, Laikipia, and West Pokot are likely to be the hardest hit.The Kenya meteorological department acting director Peter Ambenje said rains in most parts of the country will be depressed.He was speaking to the star at Lilian Towers, Nairobi, yesterday during the department's quality service improvement programme.
