Murang'a Governor Mwangi wa Iria has denied reports he was summoned by Jubilee Party's disciplinary committee over chaos in county board elections.Wa Iria said he only learned of the summons on social media and would not therefore appear to offer explanations."There is no way the party can summon one person from a meeting that was attended by 100 aspirants. Let them charge us all. We can defend ourselves," he told journalists at the party's headquarters on Wednesday."If there are issues against me they should write to me and say why I am the only one being summoned."Wa Iria was summoned alongside Kirinyaga's Joseph Ndathi, Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko and Nakuru East MP David Gikaria.He is said to have forced himself into the venue with his supporters resulting in chaos.In Kirinyaga, a meeting ended in disarray after some of the participants hurled objects at JP officials and aspirants.A meeting convened to appoint the Nairobi board ended in chaos after two groups of aspirants and their supporters clashed.Supporters of Team Nairobi and governor aspirant Peter Kenneth clashed after a section of Team Nairobi aspirants alleged that the secretariat had a list of preferred members of the board.More on this: Jubilee summons Wa Iria, Sonko over chaos at county board electionsThe Governor accused Kigumo MP Jamleck Kamau of leading the chaos at Muranga Teachers Training College last Saturday."The MP and his team stood up and insisted that the elections continue yet officials had called it off.
