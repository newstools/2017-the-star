Gor Mahia showed the mettle of champions as they chalked up a second successive win to claim top spot as the SportPesa Premier League negotiated the second round of fixtures.Reigning Footballer of the Year, Kenneth Muguna, was the toast of town as he scored the lone goal in Kisumu, where Gor pipped new boys Zoo Kericho 1-0. The Saturday performance marked out Ze Maria&rsquo;s side as the team to beat in the battle for the title as their likely challengers Tusker continued to falter.The brewers suffered the second loss on the trot as they were beaten 2-0 by Thika United&mdash;a result that left them propping up the league table. It has not been a rosy start for Ugandan tactician George Nsiimbe after the achievements of his compatriot Paul Nkata, who is now at Bandari.Their results could not be more different as the dockers are among five teams with four points but sit in fifth due to an inferior goal difference after their goal-less draw with Posta Rangers.Nzoia United, who notched the standout result of the campaign so far with the opening day walloping of the league holders, lie second as they were held to a goal-less draw by third-placed Mathare United.That outcome continued to show that the second division champions have what it takes to compete in the elite league. All honours, however, belong to highly underestimated AFC Leopards, who started the season with a 3-0 thumping of supermarket giants, Nakumatt.Ghanaian striker Gilbert Fiamenyo scored Ingwe&rsquo;s first goal on his debut after getting on the end of Robinson Kamura&rsquo;s delivered free kick before Marsellus Ingotse, who replaced Fiamenyo in the second half, extended Leopards&rsquo; lead in the 84th minute, picking Paul Kiongera&rsquo;s pass to beat Nakumatt custodian Sammy Okinda with aplomb.Kenya international Kiongera turned from provider to scorer a minute later with a lovely, explosive finish to give Stuart Hall a dream start at the Den.Nakumatt&rsquo;s defeat means that apart from Nzoia, none of the three other teams promoted to the top flight league have picked up a point.Just like Zoo, Kariobangi Sharks were beaten 1-0 by Muhoroni Sugar. Ambrose Ayoyi struck from the penalty spot to inflict a second defeat on William Muluya&rsquo;s charges.Sofapaka made a disappointing return to top flight football as they lost 1-0 to Sony Sugar.George Abege, who had been summoned as a second half replacement, scored a fine individual goal that was worthy of being the game winner. Sofapaka should have drawn level minutes to the end but Moses Odhiambo fluffed his penalty kick after Sony&rsquo;s Joseph Omweri had been penalised for handling the ball inside the box.
