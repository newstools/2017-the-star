Recently circumcised men do not necessarily adopt riskier sexual practices because of perceived protection from HIV after the procedure, a study conducted in Kisumu shows.Policymakers have been concerned the goal of circumcision could be frustrated through risk compensation &ndash; increases in HIV-risk behaviour stemming from perceived lower risk of contracting HIV. &ldquo;There was no association between circumcision status and sexual behaviours, HIV knowledge, or indicators of risk perception,&rdquo; the study says. It is published in the current edition of the Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes.Walter Jaoko, Matthew Westercamp and other researchers conducted three cross-sectional surveys of randomly sampled households in Kisumu.They said 7,507 people took part in the three surveys, between 2009 and 2013.The prevalence of male circumcision in Kisumu increased steadily from 32 per cent in 2009 to 49 per cent in 2011 and 60 per cent in 2013. This was associated with a fall in sexually transmitted infections in the community, especially in circumcised men.But there were no differences observed between circumcised and uncircumcised men in sexual behaviour - including condom use and number of sexual partners - or in knowledge about HIV or perception of HIV risk. &ldquo;HIV prevalence in circumcised men was half that of uncircumcised men, and there was no or minimal sexual risk compensation,&rdquo; Jaoko said.The results affirm that voluntary medical male circumcision is an effective tool in reducing HIV infections in Kenya.County health director Dickens Onyango said the number of new infections has declined. &ldquo;In 2013, the county had 10,349 new infections, which dropped to 8,790 in 2015,&rdquo; he said.Kenya launched its voluntary medical male circumcision programme in 2008, and close to one million men have been circumcised to prevent HIV. A recent modelling study showed the country will reach the break-even point in 2026 and start saving more money that would have been spent on treatment.In total, the voluntary medical male circumcisions already provided will avert 160,000 new HIV infections by 2030.
