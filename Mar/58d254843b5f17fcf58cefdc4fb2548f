Tycoon Raj Harikrishna Devani, who has been charged with assaulting his mother, will appear in court today for bail rulingYesterday he denied assaulting Bambi Harikrishna Devani on February 28 at Runda estate. He was arrested on Tuesday and arraigned in court yesterday. The prosecution, led by Diana Orago, urged the court not to grant Devani bail since he has other cases. "The accused has failed the tests of attending court sessions, where two other courts in Milimani and Narok have issued warrants of arrest against the accused," Orago said.She told the court the accused lives with his mother in the same house. "... the accused assaulted her there [and] she is afraid if the accused is released on bail he can abuse or assault her in the house," Orago said.The court heard that Harikrishna has received threatening SMSs from her son since he was arrested and he had emotionally abused her in the past."The complainant received threats from the accused through text reading that "You will remember this day" when she reported the matter to the police," the court heardBut Devani's lawyer Steve Kimathi said he is charged with a misdemeanour, which is bailable. He said the prosecution was relying on speculation not supported with an affidavit."The prosecution should not be prejudicial with the rights of the accused while relying on information of the victim which can be put to tests, since there is no verification of the information," Kimathi said.He asked the prosecution to put the victim in witness protection.Kiambu senior principal magistrate Stella Atambo said she will rule on bail at 11:40am after the prosecution provides the affidavits.
