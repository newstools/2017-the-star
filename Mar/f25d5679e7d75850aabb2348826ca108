Title deeds for Moi University and the Eldoret International Airport have been cancelled following an order by the High Court affecting 25,000 acres of land, including that owned by the family of former nominated MP Mark Too.In total, 14,822 title deeds will be revoked following the court order that affects more than 200,000 people living on the land.The family of Too, through his widow Sophie Too, has said the former legislator owned only 2,000 acres of the land and not the entire 25,000 acres.High Court judge Anthony Obwayo had on February 8 ruled that the land belongs to squatters who had sued Too and the Commissioner of Lands. They said the land was allocated to them by the government during retired President Daniel Moi&rsquo;s administration.&ldquo;As a family we are still mourning the death of Too, but we have been forced to come out and explain the land matter because it's being reported erroneously by the media that Too owned 25,000 acres whose titles have been revoked by the court,&rdquo; Sophie said.She said Too was sued by the squatters because he previously worked as an employee of the East Africa Tanning and Extract Company, that was a subsidiary of Lonrho East Africa. The company initially owned all the land then sold it to many individuals and firms, Sophie said.&ldquo;Too bought 2,000 acres and registered it under Fanikiwa Limited. All the other 23,000 acres belong to different people and institutions, including Moi University and the Eldoret Airport,&rdquo; she said.Sophie explained that part of Too&rsquo;s land registered as EATEC/ 9608 was affected by the court order. The land belonging to the airport is registered as 9606 and 9607 and 745, which is also listed in the court ruling as part of the title deeds to be cancelled.Moi University land measuring more than 4,300 acres is also listed as part of the title deeds to be revoked and is registered as number 10794.Moi University was established in the area following orders by Moi in 1984, while the airport was put up in 1997 on the same land at a cost of more than Sh4 Billion.&ldquo;This land is a big issue and it&rsquo;s not good that journalists and other people should sensationalise the matter by always writing that Too owned the entire 25,000 acres yet that is not true,&rdquo; Sophie said.Too's family and all other people who bought the EATEC land will meet today at the farm to discuss the court ruling and appeal against it.Mark Too died on December 31 and was buried on his farm on January 9 on the land near the airport.The court ruled that the family will only retain 60 acres of the land.
