Lecturers&rsquo; union officials yesterday ignored the call by a Senate committee to call off their strike as it intensifies arbitration to resolve the negotiation impasse with the state. The UASU officials, led by secretary general Constantine Wesonga and chairman Muga K&rsquo;Olale, told the Senate Education committee they will only end the strike once the government agrees to enhance the Sh10 billion offer to address the pay rise demand in their 2013-17 Collective Bargaining Agreement.The Universities Academic Staff Union representatives said they are ready to resume duties immediately if their CBA is signed and the government accepts to add about Sh9 billion. The officials, however, cast doubt on the availability of the Sh10 billion offer on grounds the Inter-Public Universities Councils Consultative Forum, negotiating with the Education ministry on their behalf, has refused to give them documents from the Treasury to prove the money is released. The K&rsquo;Olale-led team told the committee chaired by Kirinyaga Senator Daniel Karaba the IPUCCF has been impeding negotiations to end the strike because it has been forcing the union to agree with its predetermined stand, including the amount to be offered in their engagement. &ldquo;Other sectors within the Public Service are well catered for,&rdquo; K&rsquo;Olale said.
