Star are using the friendly matches as build up for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers which start in June with a match against Sierra Leone.Kenya are in Group F where they also meet four-time Africa champions Ghana and Ethiopia.Most pundits aver that five time champions and beaten finalists Ghana present the biggest stumbling block to Kenya&rsquo;s aspirations of qualifying for the sixteen nation biennial showpiece to be held in Cameroon. Home form, where Stars have only won one qualifier against Congo Brazaville and lost twice against Zambia recently will be crucial to Kenyas hopes. With reasonable away fixtures against Sierra Leone and Ethiopia to contend with and better preparations than ever being planned, its not far-fetched for Okumbi&rsquo;s charges to qualify, either as long shot group winners or one of the three best placed runners up in the group stages.Stars defeated DRC 1-0 in October last year in Kinshasha in another friendly courtesy of former Gor Mahia striker Michael Olunga. Kenya last faced Uganda in August last year in Kampala with the match ending in a goalless stalemate.Both matches will be played at Nyayo stadium as the Kasarani stadium is under renovationStars are ranked 87th in the FIFA rankings and wins over the two sides will be crucial in improving the same.Football Kenya Federation president Nick Mwendwa said with good preparation Stars, can end their 13 year hiatus from the Africa Cup of Nations by qualifying for the Cameroon showpiece.&ldquo;We have a good chance of qualification since the pool looks favourable and with good preparation by playing such friendlies, we should be in a good position to qualify for Cameroon,&rdquo; added Mwendwa.
