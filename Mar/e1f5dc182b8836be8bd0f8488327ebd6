Lands Cabinet Secretary Jacob Kaimenyi has accused some politicians of instigating land invasions to gain political mileage. He said the government will not seat back and watch such people deny rightful owners their land entitlement.&ldquo;Politicians must not make political capital out of land as we won&rsquo;t allow that in Kenya,&rdquo; he said. Kaimenyi said the government will defend all genuine landowners, be they local or foreign. The CS said there is &ldquo;increasing appetite&rdquo; for any open space.Lease hold property owners have in the recent past been a target of a cartel, which in collusion with Lands ministry and county officials, fraudulently processes extension and renewal of land leases. To deal with this, the ministry has set up a team to review land leases.&ldquo;The scope of the task force is to look at leases issued between 2010 and 2016 to see if due diligence was done. Gaps, weaknesses and those culpable for renewals done against the law will be disciplined,&rdquo; he said at his Ardhi House office. The 11-member task force is chaired by Ibrahim Mwathane, an expert on land matters as well as the chairman of the Land Development and Governance Institute.The task force will analyse and review the existing policy, legal and institutional framework on processing of extension and renewal of leases.They will also establish the status of leases held by investors in various sectors and make recommendations on the actions to be taken against all individuals who have been involved in the fraudulent renewal and extension of leases.Members are Christine Ileli, Shadrack Omondi, Duncan Okubasu, Nancy Mwangi and Pauletter Achieng. Others are Mucai Kunyiha, Palkash Shah,Patricia Mbugua,Mercy Njamwea and John Nthuku.
