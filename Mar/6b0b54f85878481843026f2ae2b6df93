Kiambu residents have been urged not to turn away firefighters when they arrive late to scenes of fire.Lari subcounty administrator Michael Mutuku yesterday said residents have developed a culture of insulting firefighters without considering the distance they cover before they can arrive at a scene.He urged them to appreciate the fact that the government has bought several fire engines for all subcounties. Mutuku was reacting to a Monday incident in which firefighters were insulted after they arrived late to put out a fire at the home of Wangui King&rsquo;ori in Roromo village.He said the engine used in the area had broken down and they had to hire another from Kiambaa, 30 kilometres away. King&rsquo;ori is cousin of former head of Civil Service Francis Kimemia. &ldquo;We should not conclude that the firefighters wanted to be late deliberately. The officials were angered by a group of youths who started hitting the vehicle, calling the officials names,&rdquo; Mutuku said. It was reported that the youths turned away the vehicle at the Roromo trading centre, about 500 metres away from King&rsquo;ori&rsquo;s home. King&rsquo;ori said the fire started at around 6pm. She heard children scream.Residents came and assisted the family to put it out, but it was fuelled by wind, king&rsquo;ori said, adding that the wooden house was gutted down and Sh1 million assets destroyed.
