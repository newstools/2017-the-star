The delay in naming NASA flag bearer is good for the opposition but bad for Jubilee, Vihiga Senator George Khaniri has said.Khaniri said the only reason Jubilee is eager to know NASA's presidential candidate is because they want to start ruining his chances of election ahead of August polls. &ldquo;We want to remove a sitting government. You cannot place all the cards on the table. You must do it in doses. That is what we are tactically doing as long as we meet the set IEBC timelines,&rdquo; he told the Star on the phone yesterday.He said Kenyans know the alliance's four co-principals and are ready to support one who will be given the presidential ticket. The four include Raila Odinga (ODM), Musalia Mudavadi (ANC), Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper) and Ford Kenya&rsquo;s Moses Wetang'ula.&ldquo;They are ready for any of the four regardless of his party because they know only NASA will redeem them,&rdquo; he said.But Emuhaya MP Wilbur Otichilo on Tuesday said the delay in naming the opposition candidate could cost NASA victory as it is in favour of the opponents.Speaking on breakfast show on a local TV, Otichilo said opposition aspirants and supporters want to know the candidate so that they can start campaigning for him.Khaniri defended Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka over claims that he was blowing hot and cold over his commitment to NASA.&ldquo;Kalonzo has unequivocally stated that he is in NASA to stay. By demanding that he be named flag bearer is meant to raise his stakes for the ticket, which all principals are free to do,&rdquo; he said.Khaniri said if any of the four leaves NASA he will be &ldquo;finished&rdquo; politically as Kenyans will never forgive them.Speaking during a NASA rally in Mathare last weekend, Mudavadi said opposition supporters who will shun NASA's presidential candidate on the account of his tribe are working for Jubilee.He said Kenyans are ready for any candidate among the co-principals who will run for president as long as the opposition remains united.
