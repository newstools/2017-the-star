Corruption and bad leadership is the reason Kenya is ranked amongst the poorest countries in the world at position 133, Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua has said.He said Kenyans are to blame for this predicament saying citizens have continuously voted for leaders who lack vision every election year."We are the fools who elect bad leaders every five years and expect change. Let the leaders show their scorecards before you give them another contract," Mutua said.He spoke on Saturday when he met delegates to popularise his Maendeleo Chap Chap party in Busia county.The governor said most legislators are out to grab public resources yet they earn more than Sh1.5 million every month.Mutua further condemned the country&rsquo;s corrupt leaders, calling them selfish and self-centered people who put the welfare of citizens last. "Kenya is a rich country with too much politics. But the problem is not the leaders. It is us who keep on making the same mistake," he said.He said his administration has transformed Machakos in five years, adding that it is possible for other counties to emulate the same by joining Chap Chap."We only need development-oriented leaders in MCC. We cannot embrace corrupt leaders who will continue fooling us and end up finishing our country," Mutua said.He further called on Kenyans to vote for parties based on their development records and not on tribal lines."Petty politics cannot develop our country. Our youth need employment, education and better services. We cannot achieve these through politics of self-interest," Mutua said. He assured MCC members that the party is ready with all the campaign materials and will support its aspirants throughout the campaign period.He said his party will find a lasting solution to the problem of water scarcity in Busia, urging the members to reach out to residents to win votes."God uses leaders to reach citizens. I am ready since God has chosen me," Mutua said.He added that the outfit will field candidates in all elective posts but support President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s re-election bid.Read: Gitobu Imanyara ditches ODM for Maendeleo Chap ChapAlso read: Blow for Jubilee as Embu leaders defect to Maendeleo Chap Chap
