Friends and foes joined hands on Monday to give an emotional send off of Nyeri First Governor Nderitu Gachagua. Over 20,000 mourners led President Uhuru Kenyatta, Deputy President William Ruto, Former President Mwai Kibaki and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga joined hands and spoke in one voice for the first time publicly. And they kept their political differences and spoke good of devolution with them lauding Gachagua as one the best Governors who championed devolution. "Gachagua has for the first time made me to agree with my friend Raila Odinga about devolution," Said President. Uhuru expressed shock that it was unfortunate that some MCAs block Governor&rsquo;s manifestos and fail to pass even budgets leaving wananchi suffering. "Governor has his program and his manifesto but MCAs oppose, add and deduct it instead of playing oversight role. Your role is to ensure that public funds are not stolen," he said.He pleaded with Nyeri MCAs to ensure that this year&rsquo;s supplementary budget is passed adding that they should unite with the second Nyeri governor Samuel Wamathai to ensure the projects that Gachagua had started are completed.Wamathai had earlier told the crowd that the Nyeri County assembly has delayed in passing of the supplementary budget where crucial funds to develop the county are included.Odinga had earlier told mourners that elected leaders have abused devolution by misusing funds travelling outside countries in the name of bench marking and bonding and holding ransom Governors.
