Kamaria was present.Mattah said, &ldquo;Kamaria&rsquo;s leadership will ensure equitable distribution of resources. We want the Mbita and Suba people to stand behind her.&rdquo;Jakakimba hails from Mfanga&rsquo;no Island, as does Kamaria.He said, &ldquo;She is our only hope, so we need to support her.&rdquo;Kamaria warned her rivals against using Raila&rsquo;s name to gain mileage because he has not endorsed any candidate.&ldquo;We have promised that party primaries will be free and fair so let nobody cling to Raila&rsquo;s coat and claim to be closer to him than others. All ODM members have access to Raila,&rdquo; she said.Kamaria criticised the current leadership for failing to promote fishing.
