The Suba community in Suna West and Suna East subcounties have endorsed Migori Governor Okoth Obado for another term.A few months ago, Kuria, Nyatike and Kanyamkago elders supported Obado when he was installed as an elder.Addressing the public at Buembu in Suna West on Tuesday, the elders urged leaders to respect them and their advice. &ldquo;We are lucky to be at the county headquarter as a community. Our decisions should be respected by any leader,&rdquo; Suba Community Council of Elders chairman Japheth Riogi said. The elders have threatened to disown ODM leader Raila Odinga if any of the community's decision is not followed. Riogi accused youths of disrespecting the elders' decisions.In 2014, President Uhuru Kenyatta was heckled by youths and shoes thrown at the dais while addressing the public in Migori town.
