The Director of Public Prosecutions has slapped a new charge against nominated Senator Ben Njoroge over the gun drama on the Nairobi-Nakuru highway last month.The senator, who represents people living with a disability, was charged at the Naivasha law courts with carrying a firearm while being disorderly.On February 7, at the Naivasha View Petrol station, Njoroge behaved in a disorderly manner while carrying a Ceska pistol.The charge sheet states the senator shot at Vivo Energy Kenya personnel who had come to repossess the station. The senator, represented by lawyer Francis Mburu, denied the charge before Naivasha chief magistrate Dominica Nyambu.The lawyer applied to have the previous bond terms extended, saying the accused is a respected member of the Senate and could not abscond proceedings.The magistrate extended the bond terms until May 15 when the case will come up for hearing. Last month, the senator was charged with creating a disturbance in a manner likely to breach the peace by firing at the workers. The senator is out on Sh50,000 bail.Soon after he left the courts, the senator drove to the Naivasha police station where he lodged a complaint about missing cash and goods from the petrol station. Njoroge said after he was kicked out of the petrol station, the management carted away some goods. He alleged that the fuel company broke into a safe where thousands of shillings and important documents were kept.Speaking at Naivasha police station, Njoroge said he would sue the fuel company for ignoring a court order and breaching a legal contract.Last month, the senator clashed with the MD of the fuel company, Polycarp Igathe, and opened fire at a group of youth who had been hired to close down the petrol station.The oil company had moved in to shut down the petrol station after the senator allegedly violated some rules.
