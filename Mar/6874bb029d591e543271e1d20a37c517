A fierce fire destroyed hundreds of indigenous trees at the Menengai forest in Nakuru on Friday.The inferno, which spread in more than 220 acres of the forest, caused panic among residents.The raging flames were fanned by wind, raising fears it could spread to the neighbouring homes.Kenya Forest Service officers responded to the incident and put out the fire before it could spread to Nakuru GK prison.It took the officers more than three hours to put off the flames.KFS Central Rift commandant David Mtoro said the cause of the inferno is yet to be established."We were tipped about the incident and informed the county fire brigade who responded swiftly," Mtoro said.Richard Rop, Nakuru Environment CEC, said: "We suspect acts of arson by those trying to access the forest for timber."A similar incident was witnessed in March 2015 where more than 300 acres was destroyed.Read: Fire consumes 49 acres of Ruma Park in Homa BayAlso read: KFS warns not to start fires in tinder-dry land
