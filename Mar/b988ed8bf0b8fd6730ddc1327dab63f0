More men than women are visiting religious and traditional leaders, a survey released by the UoN's Institute of Development Studies has revealed.The study by Afrobarometer reported that 61 per cent of men visit religious healers compared to women at 60 per cent.Another 38 per cent of men visit traditional leaders compared to women at 29 per cent as per the study conducted between September and October 2016.Though the survey does not indicate what the men specifically seek help for, both men and women prefer the two as their first stop when faced with troubles.The study further posits that more men contact their local MCA, MP and political party officials compared to the women.The men were rated at 23% for contact made with MP, 13% (MCA), 12% (party official) compared to women's 12, 6, 5 per cent respectively.The survey further reveals that 54% of Kenyans fear political violence and intimidation."Women are less likely than men to discuss politics, contact political leaders, join activism groups and attend community meetings," the study reveals.Prof Winnie Mitullah, director UoN Institute of Development Studies, on Wednesday said it was worth noting that 15% of women say they have personally suffered discrimination or harassment based on gender.She said another 78% of Kenyans said wife beating was never justifiable compared to about 10% who said it was somewhat justifiable."About two thirds of Kenyan women (63 per cent), and men (68 per cent) said the government has performed well in promoting opportunities and equality for women," she said.She said though 56% of Kenyans say women's equality has improved in recent years, more than 63% did not agree that only men should be given priority in hiring if jobs are scarce."While 9 out of 10 Kenyans say that girls now have the same opportunities to access education as boys, perceptions of gender equality dropped to 7 out of 10," Mitullah said.Read: Clerics alarmed by &lsquo;witchcraft&rsquo; killings, missing children
