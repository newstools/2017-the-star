Homa Bay county ODM branch aspirants on Wednesday warned the National Elections Board against merging polling centres during party nominations. They said this will automatically lead to violence since there will be a lot of confusion. The aspirants said they are ready to fund the process to allow their supporters to participate at their respective polling centres. “... this has always led to violence in the past and we do not want to witness such incidents this time round,” Kabondo Kasipul MP aspirant Ouma Muga said. “The money we will use to ferry our supporters to different polling centres is enough to sponsor the party to conduct nominations per every polling centre we are ready to fund.” They were speaking at ACK Guest House during a peace meeting. The aspirants promised to hold peaceful campaigns.
