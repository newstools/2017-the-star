The proposed Kenya Anglican University in Embu will get a Sh60.8 billion grant from the US-based Global Trade and Finance Company. Company president and CEO Kon Lee said the the cash will be donated in the next two years for infrastructural development. She said part of the money will be disbursed soon after financing formalities are finalised. The grant includes Sh30.8 billion for the university’s internal design. Lee said it will be modelled on world-class universities. She said the remaining Sh30 billion will construct external facilities. Embu Senator Lenny Kivuti (pictured) hosted the company’s directors at Kanyuambora Secondary School in Mbeere North subcounty, where the university will be located. He said when complete, it will transform the region into an internationally recognised technology hub, complete with innovation centres. The team, which visited the venue for inspection, included 22 technocrats, international engineers and architects. “The university will have a medical school, research development centre, high technology engineering complex and an industrial and commercial park,” Kivuti said. He said unique innovations, modelled along internationally accepted techniques, will be developed at the university, in partnership with Korean and United States universities. Kivuti said conceptual designs were conceived three years ago and were earlier in the week presented and approved by the Board of Trustees of the Anglican Church, chaired by Archbishop Jackson Sapit.
