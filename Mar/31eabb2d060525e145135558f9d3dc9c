Kenya will have chaotic elections if sporadic conflicts in some cosmopolitan counties are not resolved, IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati has said.He said the root cause of intra- and extra-county conflicts is stiff competition for different positions.In a speech, Chebukati said impunity, legal actions and pressure from citizens and civil society groups on IEBC threaten August polls.His speech was read by Commissioner Margaret Mwachanya during the ongoing Second Annual Legislative Summit in Mombasa.Chebukati said availability of small arms is increasing insecurity.The chairman said Kenya&rsquo;s military presence in Somalia makes Kenya vulnerable now and during the election period. &ldquo;The threat by al Shabaab that they will disrupt the elections sends a chilling signal,&rdquo; he said.The IEBC concerns comes as the military has been sent to the troubled North Rift to help police restore law and order.KDF has been deployed to parts of Baringo, Elgeyo Marakwet, Pokot and Laikipia counties. Many civilians in these areas have illegally acquired guns.Chebukati said Kenya is still recovering from the 2007-08 post-election violence that left more than 1,200 dead and 600,000 displaced.&ldquo;It was self-destruction,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;A free and fair election is the outcome of complex processes, requiring participation of players with key roles of forging peaceful outcomes.&rdquo;The IEBC boss said ethnic politics, weak governance and unemployment will ignite violence.Chebukati asked politicians to campaign and leave the running of the election to the IEBC. &ldquo;Questions on whether there will be a free and fair election have been asked many times. I reassure you the IEBC is ready,&rdquo; he said.The IEBC will focus on and adopt good electoral standards that deter electoral impunity, Chebukati added.ODM secretary general Agnes Zani cautioned against manipulation of results and said they will dispute results if elections are not credible.&ldquo;Justice is that, as a Kenyan, when I vote for candidate A, my vote should count. I don&rsquo;t want to vote for candidate A and my vote goes to candidate B and [I&rsquo;m] told not to talk,&rdquo; she said.Zani said they do not have confidence in the IEBC, as its processes from the voter registration have been flawed.&ldquo;With the number of IDs duplicated and procurement processes that have been there, we have a right to say there is a problem. We shall point out and not be muzzled,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;Our problem is how the results are transmitted. We want nothing short of a transparent process.&rdquo;The government has banned mass action after the polls, incitement, zoning areas exclusively as belonging to particular candidates or parties, engaging criminal gangs to intimidate opponents, bribery of voters and disruption of opponents&rsquo; campaign meetings.
