Maendeleo Chap Chap leaders have resolved to use direct nomination and consensus to pick aspirants.The party, which has said it will field candidates in all elective seats apart from that of President, will hand out direct nominations in regions they are sure of victory.Consensus will be in regions where the party has more than one aspirant.Party leader Alfred Mutua told members at Kasarani yesterday they would only go for ballot nominations if consensus fails.&ldquo;In areas where there are two or more aspirants, they will have to sit down and they can negotiate on who to vie and maybe agree that one candidate runs next time,&rdquo; he said.The party will begin nominations in mid-April.He also said his party would not allow plans to shelve the election to a later date.&ldquo;The election has to be conducted on August 8 and this is constitutional. No one is allowed to make changes to it unless through a referendum,&rdquo; Mutua said.This comes as a section of politicians allied to the Jubilee Party spoke out, saying the opposition is planning to push for change of election date.
