A judge has barred Parliament from considering a petition for removal of Auditor General Edward Ouko from office over a Sh100 million tender.High Court judge Chacha Mwita issued the temporary orders following an application by activist Okiya Omtatah.This means the parliamentary committee investigating Ouko will have to put on hold its work until the case is heard. The committee held its meetings last week and was supposed to resume sittings this week to complete its work by March 20.Omtatah&rsquo;s case is the second challenging Ouko&rsquo;s removal. The other was filed by Ouko himself. The petition for his removal, which is pending before Parliament, was lodged by Emmanuel Mwagambo.Mwita also gave orders restraining National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi from forwarding any resolution of the August House to President Uhuru Kenyatta.In his suit papers, Omtatah argues that Mwagambo&rsquo;s petition is an attempt to drag the National Assembly into the ongoing malicious campaign to hound Ouko from office through unfounded allegations. Some of the allegations include impropriety, but the activist says Ouko has been exonerated in most of them after thorough inquiry by competent investigative agencies.&ldquo;Muturi and Mwagambo are seeking to use Parliament to precipitate an extrajudicial attack on an innocent independent constitutional office holder in broad daylight,&rdquo; Omtatah said.He terms the attempt as a deliberate violation of Ouko&rsquo;s rights to a fair trial and good reputation.&ldquo;It is in the public domain that Ouko is a marked man for diligently performing his duties under the law, hence this matter is of extreme public interest and an urgent one as the actions complained of contravene the Constitution, yet it is being fast-tracked,&rdquo; Omtatah said. The case will be heard on May 10.
