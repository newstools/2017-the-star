President Uhuru Kenyatta yesterday cancelled his trip to Tharaka Nithi and Meru counties, just a day after State House announced it.State House attributed the cancellation of the two-day trip, which was to start today, to &ldquo;unavoidable circumstances&rdquo;.&ldquo;President Kenyatta will, however, make a visit to the Western region later in the week. This will include Trans Nzoia, Bungoma, Busia and Kakamega counties. A detailed programme will be issued in due course,&rdquo; State House spokesperson Manoah Esipisu said in a statement.On Sunday, Esipisu said Uhuru would visit Tharaka Nithi and Meru counties to commission and inspect development projects.These would include provision of diagnostic medical equipment to hospitals, construction of roads and provision of electricity to residents and schools.The President has been making trips to different parts of the country, especially those perceived to be opposition strongholds.He is preparing for the August 8 election.Accompanied by Deputy President William Ruto, Uhuru has used the opportunity to highlight the government&rsquo;s achievements, while popularising the Jubilee Party.Last week, he visited Nyamira and Kisii counties, where he commissioned projects.In Nyamira, Uhuru launched the Nyamira divisional police headquarters that has been refurbished and construction of police housing.He launched construction of the Sh3.1 billion Chebilat&ndash;Ikonge&ndash;Chabera road.State House said the Jubilee administration is spending Sh22 billion to improve the road network in the county.In Kisii, the President launched construction of the Nyamira&ndash;Igonga-Teso&ndash;Itibo&ndash;Kiabusura&ndash;Mwata&ndash;Bogitaa&ndash;Riana&ndash;Iyabe&ndash;Ekiendege-Chisaro road.Ruto presided over the launch of the Kajauri&ndash;Nyansiongo&ndash;Metamaiywo road.The presidency is on a public relations mission to showcase the Jubilee administration&rsquo;s achievements over the last four years.The opposition has accused the Uhuru administration of failing to deliver on its promises to Kenyans.But State House has dismissed these claims, saying the opposition has chosen to turn a blind eye on the transformations the country has undergone.&ldquo;The opposition has a narrative that falsely portrays our country as not doing well and down-talks the achievements of the Kenyan people and our economy,&rdquo; Esipisu said.&ldquo;The President is hard at work, building and supporting the institutions entrenched in the 2010 Constitution as the vanguard of our nation state.&rdquo;He said despite a &ldquo;false narrative that is crumbling by the day&rdquo;, Kenya is making and showing progress.Esipisu noted that last year, Kenya&rsquo;s economic growth remained resilient, despite headwinds from a weak global economy, posting an average 5.9 per cent growth in the first three quarters.&ldquo;This growth was largely supported by high government investment in infrastructure such as roads, low international oil prices, improved agricultural performance, particularly in the first half of the year, recovery of the tourism sector and stable macroeconomic environment,&rdquo; he said.The spokesperson said the President is working hard to ensure this positive outlook remains secure, despite uncertainties in the global economy and the outcome of the Brexit negotiations.
