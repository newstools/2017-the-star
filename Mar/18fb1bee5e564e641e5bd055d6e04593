Westlands MP Timothy Wanyonyi has urged residents to welcome all political aspirants, then decide who to vote for.He spoke on Saturday at St Joseph Primary School, a day after Governor Evans Kidero was heckled when opening Thiong&rsquo;o Road. He was with woman representative aspirant Beatrice Kwamboka.The crowd accused Kidero of &ldquo;taking development to Eastlands and sidelining Westlands and its environments&rdquo;. But Kidero said money had been allocated for the tarmacking of the road. Wanyonyi distanced himself from the chaos and condemned those who organised it.&ldquo;Anyone close to me and associates himself with violence should stop being in my company. I neither support violence nor condone it. It&rsquo;s shameful when residents heckle leaders,&rdquo; he said.Wanyonyi was issuing bursary cheques. &ldquo;I am a leader of all residents of Mountain View. I was elected to serve all, irrespective of your standing in society, political affiliation and tribe,&rdquo; he said.
