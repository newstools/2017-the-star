The stage is set for a bruising National Olympic Committee (NOCK) elections on May 5 after the constitution was passed at the third time.The decision was reached after 18 delegates plus the 11 national executive members of the committee voted in favour of the constitution after two previous meetings ended in acrimony and disagreement.The new constitution strips the executive members of voting rights and that has the bone of the contention for the past three months with incumbent members toeing tough line leading to the deadlock.This new development come in the wake of the decision by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to freeze financial support a fortnight ago after the last general assembly meeting failed to pass the constitution.Following the passing of the Constitution, the Nock executive in conjunction with the affiliates are expected to appoint an independent electoral board committee to oversee the elections. Four bodies have already show interest to guide the election process including the Centre for Multi Party Democracy, Law Society of Kenya, Ombudsman and Transparency International.The executive, in conjunction with the affiliates, will meet again next week on April 5 to deliberate on the elections rules and guidelines.Speaking at the end of the meeting, Nock first vice chairman Ben Ekumbo, urged for sobriety and asked members to put hostility aside. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m asking the federations and affiliates to exercise maturity as we go forward. It&rsquo;s been very acrimonious but now we can say that we have the new document and can move forward and conduct peaceful elections,&rdquo; added Ekumbo.&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s embrace this spirit of accepting to do things as required. Change is inevitable and sometimes I think that&rsquo;s a good thing,&rdquo; noted Ekumbo.Ekumbo down played IOC move to withdraw funding, saying: &ldquo;There is nothing to worry about. Scholarships with federations and other programmes will continue.&rdquo;Nock chairman Kipchoge Keino asked the affiliates to look the bigger picture and not just themselves going forward. &ldquo;We all represent the interest of these sportsmen and women in the country. Nock is not myself or Ekumbo or Soi it&rsquo;s is bigger than all of us and we must champion the interests of our sportsmen and women,&rdquo; added Keino.Kipchoge and Ekumbo confirmed they will defend their respective seats in the May polls.Kenya Table Tennis Association (KTTA) chairman, Andrew Mudibo, termed the passing of the constitution as a new dawn in the Kenya sports fraternity.&ldquo;We have been pushing for reforms for a long time and finally, there is light at the end of the tunnel and I am glad that good reasoning has prevailed and we have a new Constitution,&rdquo; added Mudibo. He said federations&rsquo; were crying for governance and accountability and this is the right time to elect people who can take Nock forward.
