ODM has changed its nomination rules to avert possible fallout and chaos. Party leader Raila Odinga and National Elections Board chairperson Judith Pareno on Saturday said any aspirant who causes chaos will automatically be disqualified and will not take part in the nominations. The two spoke in the Jubilee Hall, Mombasa, where they met aspirants from the coastal region. “Nominations can build or destroy parties,” Raila said, adding that they want to avoid a repeat of what happened in 2013. In the run-up to the March 4, 2013 election, ODM lost popular candidates to other parties, which went on to clinch crucial positions, including governors, senators, MPs and MCAs. In Migori, Governor Okoth Obado ditched ODM for the People’s Democratic Party, citing flawed nominations. He went on to beat ODM’s Akongo Oyugi. The same happened in Mombasa, where Senator Hassan Omar, Nyali MP Hezron Awiti and Jomvu’s Badi Twalib all ditched ODM for Wiper and went on to beat ODM candidates. According to its NEB, ODM has attracted 5,000 hopefuls across the country. The party has staggered its nominations, and will process three counties a day. Pareno said this will ensure maximum concentration and due diligence to avoid “monkey business”. In the past, parties have conducted their nominations in one day, except in areas with logistical problems. “We have put in place measures to ensure the nominations are free and fair,” Pareno said. The party has created the County Elections Committees to comprise three people each. They will oversee nominations in the counties. There will also be County Dispute Tribunals made up of five people to settle any emerging disputes by recommending the next course of action.
