Nearly 2,000 condemned buildings are still standing, most of them occupied, almost a year since the Huruma estate collapse disaster.The city pledged to pull down all death traps.Despite these time bombs, the city has halted demolitions, citing court injunctions obtained by owners, high costs, political interference and lack of support by the national government.Lands executive Christopher Khaemba said only 41 of 2,000 have been pulled down.&ldquo;We face many challenges. The county alone lacks financial capacity to demolish all these houses. There&rsquo;s no political goodwill and the state isn&rsquo;t supporting us,&rdquo; Khaemba said.On April 29 last year, 51 people were killed and tens of others injured after a building collapsed in Huruma estate.Khaemba told the Star on Friday at City Hall some owners of unsafe structures sued the city for Sh250 million compensation. They argue the county demolished their property without proof the structures were unsafe, he said. &ldquo;They said we demolished their houses based on physical appearances. This was a strong argument because we had not conducted scientific audits of the buildings,&rdquo; Khaemba said.&ldquo;But we had to appeal the ruling because none of those who took us to court had approval documents.&rdquo;Khaemba said demolition costs Sh1 million per day, extremely expensive.&ldquo;The [national] government has capacity to do this. The NYS has sophisticated machines to do this. But they decided to withdraw,&rdquo; he said.Some 14 developers obtained orders restraining the county from knocking down their buildings. Khaemba said 11 of the orders were fake.&ldquo;We had to go to the Registrar of the Judiciary to ascertain their authenticity because every building we went to had court orders pinned to them,&rdquo; he said.
