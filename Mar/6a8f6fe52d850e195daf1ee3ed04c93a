Four Administration police officers and three security guards are in police custody over a Sh4 million heist at a Nairobi supermarket. The four were arrested Saturday evening over the alleged theft from Naivas supermarket, Mountain Mall branch. Police said the decision to arrest the four was reached after CCTV cameras at the supermarket captured the officers in a relaxed position at the time of the alleged robbery. &ldquo;You can tell from the CCTV footage that it was a stage managed robbery" said a senior detective in Nairobi. The officer said two of the four APs entered the supermarket&rsquo;s strong room while the other two waited outside. The alleged robbers were armed with pistols and were said to have walked past an armed officer without any gun fight from the police. The incident happened at around 7.45 pm. An officer at Kasarani said the two AP officers waiting outside the supermarket entrance started shooting almost 10 minutes after the criminals had disappeared through a back door.
