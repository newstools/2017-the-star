Laikipia North MP Mathew Lempurkel has been directed to report to the DCI every Monday, Wednesday and Friday.This is after he appeared before a Nanyuki law court on Wednesday. He did not take plea.Laikipia East deputy DCIO Jacob Muriithi yesterday told the Star on the phone the decision will aid investigations into the murder of Sosian ranch co-owner Tristan Voorspuy.On Wednesday, the court rejected an application by the state to have Lempurkel (pictured) detained at the Nanyuki police station for 14 days.Principal prosecution counsel Lucas Tanui said the MP would interfere with the evidence.He said some time between last month and early this month Lempurkel incited residents to invade Sosian ranch and burn property. Are you burning hotels in Loisaba, Mugie and in other areas? The government is our enemy and we have people who give us money to buy guns, Lempurkel is allegedly quoted as having said.Tanui said a number of culprits were yet to be arrested and if the MP would be released, he would interfere with the investigation.Principal magistrate Waititu Gichimu rejected the application.Lempurkel was represented by senior counsel James Orengo and Norman Magare.The magistrate on March 30 will give a ruling on whether the legislator will be charged with murder or incitement to violence.
