The Housing ministry has given a 12-week ultimatum to a contractor to complete and hand over 250 civil servants’ housing units on Kisumu’s Shauri Moyo estate. PS Aldha Munano on Thursday said if the project is not turned over on time, the contractor will pay a Sh1 million monthly penalty for breach of contract. She said they cannot afford to joke with the Sh730 million project. “This is a commercial project. The government has spent a lot on it and the more it delays, the more the government loses,” Munano said. She spoke when she toured the site and expressed frustration, urging the contractor to speed up the remaining work. Munano said the ministry hopes to sell the houses by year-end and the proceeds will support similar projects elsewhere in the country. The National Civil Servants’ Housing Scheme was launched in 2014. It has benefitted 3,000 civil servants countrywide, with more than 120 units. Munano defended the pricing after county civil servants complained of the price tags. She said their concerns would be considered. Last month a three-bedroom unit was advertised for Sh6.4 million, two for Sh4.3 million and one at Sh2.7 million.
