Youth and Gender CS Sicily Kariuki has warned the opposition against politicising the National Youth Service projects. Kariuki said projects initiated by the government are meant to benefit wananchi and improve their living standards.She was speaking at Matungu headquarters, Kakamega county, on Sunday when she launched the NYS Economic Empowerment Programme. Kariuki told the opposition leaders they should not incite the public against supporting government&rsquo;s initiatives.&ldquo;It cannot be that everything the government is doing is bad. Isn&rsquo;t there any single project implemented by the Jubilee government that the opposition can single out as being useful to Kenyans?&rdquo; Kariuki said.She denied claims that Jubilee is plotting to use the National Youth Service Empowerment Programme to youth to rig the August general election. The CS said the programme is aimed raising the living standards of youth, and promised to continue with the initiative. &ldquo;In Kibera, Anyango who gave birth and was ostracised by her family is now a landlord after she joined this programme. She was trained on how to save her earnings through the national sacco. She is no longer feeling abandoned and lonely. This is how we want our youth to prosper,&rdquo; she said.She said through the programme, youths have acquired business skills and many are reformed alcoholics who are responsible citizens building the economy. Matungu MP David Were praised the programme, saying it has created jobs.
