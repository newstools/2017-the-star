The Kenya Pipeline Corporation management has dismissed allegations that it has exposed taxpayers to a possible loss of Sh40 billion under the new 450-km Mombasa-Nairobi pipeline.This follows news reports in the Daily Nation from &lsquo;whistleblowers&rsquo;, that KPC is throwing away good infrastructure and buying capacity the country has no use for.This is under the ongoing upgrading of the Sh43 billion Mombasa- Nairobi pipeline and a second Sh48 billion Line 5 to the Western region.KPC has been accused of increasing the size from 16 to 20 inch and buying pumps and equipment for projects that are not required.In a statement to newsrooms, managing director Joe Sang&rsquo; yesterday defended the expansion and choice of a 20-inch Mombasa-Nairobi pipeline. He said it was informed by a study by an independent expert consultant-Shengli Engineering &amp; Consulting Co Ltd.The survey, KPC said, established the petroleum demand for Kenya in 2013 was four billion litres, with a projected demand of 5.7 billion litres in 2016, and 6.8 billion litres in 2020.On the other hand, the demand for the export market of Uganda,Rwanda and Eastern DR Congo stood at 2.5 billion litres in 2010, but has risen to 3.5 billion litres in 2016, he said.&ldquo;At no time did KPC conceive of laying a 16-inch pipeline between Mombasa and Nairobi, this allegation is a total fabrication,&rdquo; Sang&rsquo; said.He said the current Line 1 (built in 1978 ) is 39 years old and 14 years beyond its lifespan.&ldquo;An in-line inspection carried out by NDT Middle East Co Ltd in 2010 indicated it was not operational and economically feasible to carry out repairs to the aging pipeline beyond 2014. This meant that Line 1 had to be replaced,&rdquo; he said.He said Zakhem Ltd, the contractor of Line 5, competitively won the tender. The contract sum was Sh48 billion and not Sh58 billion as alleged, Sang&rsquo; said.KPC is funding the project to the tune of Sh13.4 billion ( 30 per cent) while the company obtained funding of Sh35 billion.&ldquo;No money has been lost. As at March 28, 2017, KPC has paid 75.6 per cent of the contract sum amounting to Sh34 billion against certified completed work of 82 per cent,&rdquo; he said.KPC has also dismissed allegations that almost half of the Hydrant Pit Valves for refueling at JKIA have malfunctioned.
