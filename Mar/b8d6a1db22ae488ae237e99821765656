Picture this. Hands reach through smoke to grab scared children from rubble in the half-light.The White Helmets hurtle around the streets, pointing their van towards every new mushroom cloud on the horizon, dedicated to pulling their stricken brothers and sisters from the remains of hospitals and markets and cafes. The attacks are daily and target civilian life at its most mundane: shoppers shopping, workers working.You see hints of the men&rsquo;s own families, toddlers left at home not knowing if their fathers will come back, brothers killed in attacks even while their sibling is hurtling towards another explosion across town. Crackly mobile phone conversations, a lifeline or not, depending on the news at the other end of them.Crying kids stumble out into the street and babies with bleeding heads are carefully handed from one man to another. They&rsquo;re determined not to leave a bomb site until they have accounted for everyone. MIRACLE BABYA tiny baby, only a week old, is born a second time; still alive after 16 hours under rubble, the child is dragged through a narrow passage made in the dust by a frantic volunteer. The &ldquo;miracle baby&rdquo; becomes a talisman of hope, another reason for them all to keep going despite the nature of their task, like a child patiently standing up dominoes while a bully follows behind, knocking them over.Their belief in better times is genuine, but where does the hope come from? In a once-colourful city of Syria bleached grey by dust, they live on the rush of another life saved.This is the Oscar-winning short The White Helmets. An account of a messiah group in Syria, who believe that saving one soul, is saving the entire humanity.
