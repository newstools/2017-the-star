More than 1,000 livestock have died of starvation in Baringo as residents in IDP camps housing victims of banditry complain of hunger.The deaths were reported between Monday and Wednesday in Bartule, Chapin, Kaporion, Rondinin and Siblilo in Baringo North, and Nyimbei and Tuyotich in the South.The dwindling number of livestock has caused panic among the more than 30,000 IDPs. They said they have only received a little food from the government and well-wishers.On Wednesday, Chapin resident Kobilo Chebor said, We have to trek down steep hills to fetch the little water in drying streams. The water is not enough for domestic consumption and livestock. She said she has lost 20 goats and the remaining are emaciated. Kobilo said many children sleep hungry. We fear we could die because the one kilogramme of maize meal we receive cannot sustain our large families, she said. Kobilo praised the Kenya Red Cross and World Vision for the food they have distributed, but asked for more.Resident Richard Chepchomei urged the government to act.It has been two weeks since schools were closed because of banditry.Chepchomei urged the government to offer healthcare services to pregnant women. He said 10 women have given birth in the camps.Baringo North assistant county commissioner Njeru Ngochi said 450 IDPs in Bartabwa need relief food urgently. During a meeting attended by Baringo Senator Gideon Moi, he said the government is expected to supply food, but there is no transport. I don t even have an official vehicle to help transport food, Ngochi said.Pokot bandits have killed 10 people, injured many others and displaced more than 30,000 Tugens in two weeks.The government has deployed police reservists to restore calm.
