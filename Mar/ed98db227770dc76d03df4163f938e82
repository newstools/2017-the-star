Immediate former executive director of the Export Promotion Council Ruth Mwaniki is on the spot following accusations that foreign trade fairs were turned into a cash cow.Documents in our possession show that other than irregular purchases, hiring and misuse of funds that total more than Sh30 million, Mwaniki and seven top managers spent a record eight months at an expo in Milan, Italy, in 2015, spending a staggering Sh530 million of taxpayers&rsquo; cash.Even though the Italian government was paying full upkeep for the eight during the expo that ran from May 1 to October 31, each of the officers still drew full per diem of about Sh40,000 to Sh60,000 daily, instead of taking half per diem as per regulations.Instead of small and medium enterprises making up the largest percentage of the delegation to market Kenya and its products, the Milan delegation mainly had senior council members, who travelled with their aides and family members.Furthermore, the giveaways, which included catalogues, coffee, cashew nuts, handicrafts and T-shirts, were sold, instead of being gifted to guests who visited the Kenyan stands as free samples.The money was never accounted for.&ldquo;Expos are a preserve of SMEs to promote Kenya as a tourism, trade and investment destination. The SMEs take centre stage by using the platform to forge trade deals and market their wares to increase exports, the Council only plays a facilitating role,&rdquo; a source familiar with the Milan Expo said.&lsquo;promoted personal interest&rsquo;&ldquo;Since she came in, delegations to any Expo have been made up of the same faces of staff who are her cronies, and many exhibitions are to promote her personal or friends&rsquo; business. This is a direct conflict of interest and abuse of office.&rdquo; The source explained that there were only four SMEs against about 10 council staff accompanied by their drivers, personal assistants and family members, who are not supposed to be on such tours.The commercial crafts sold at the exhibition, the source alleged, were sourced from Tanzania by Mwaniki&rsquo;s nephew, a staffer at the Council.This comes as the Council plans to spend more than Sh230 million on Expo 2017 Astana, scheduled for June 10 to September 10 in Kazakhstan.Even though the Asian country is not a leading market for Kenyan exports, the Council has set Sh500,000 as commitment fees for SMEs willing to exhibit at the Expo, a ploy some said is aimed at locking them out so Council members can take up the slots and exhibit their personal products.Sources who attended the Milan Expo told the Star it was poorly organised and hosted at a basement kilometres away from where the main exhibition was. They said this infuriated the President when he joined the delegation during Kenyan Week.&ldquo;The place was stuffy, with heat, they had to use papers to fan the President and guests. It was an embarrassing moment. An audit on the organisation was ordered, but, to-date, no one knows what became of it,&rdquo; a source said, alleging that the reason for booking exhibition stands miles away from the main expo was to cut costs so organisers could pocket the cash.Target of witch-hunt?Mwaniki dismissed the claims, saying the issues were being brought out to slow her political ambitions.&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve insulted and fought me all through for the last six years I was at the EPC. Now that I&rsquo;m leaving for a political office, they&rsquo;re using you as a gun for hire to taint my image,&rdquo; she said.Mwaniki remained hesitant to respond to our specific questions concerning the Expos, and whether she used her position as CEO to recruit her sister, nephew and cronies at the EPC. She also declined to answer whether she intimidated, victimised or fired employees who challenged her management style.Internal statistics indicate that export trends have been on a nosedive, despite increased budget allocations to the EPC since 2011, with Ruth at the helm.
