Former Heritage minister William ole Ntimama’s daughter Lydia Masikonte and eight Narok MCAs have defected to Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto’s Chama Cha Mashinani. Masikonte on Monday made good her threat to leave Jubilee after she raised concerns about the fairness of the nominations. “My late father held my hands and took me to Jubilee but they seem to have a preferred candidate already,” Masikonte said. The MCAs are deputy speaker Stephen Kudate,(Naroosura), former Minority leader Bob Maren (Ololulunga), former deputy speaker James Kiok (Nkareta), Francis Rono (Kapsasian), Joseph Barusei (Ilmotiok), Nenkai Karkar (Jubilee nominated), Mercy Keiwa (KNC nominated), Jackson Kapei (Jubilee nominated). Narok West MP Patrick Ntutu officially joined CCM from Jubilee Party on Thursday. The MCAs were welcomed by Rutto, during Ntutu’s governor bid launch at his Olopirik home on Monday. The event was attended by Baringo Senator Gideon Moi, his West Pokot counterpart John Lonyangapuo and Kanu secretary general Nick Salat. Masikonte made good her threat to leave Jubilee after she raised concerns about the credibility of the party nominations, saying that they would not be fair. “My late father (Ntimama) held my hands and took me to the Jubilee Party but they seem to already have a preferred candidate,” Masikonte said. She said they decided to settle on CCM party after wider consultations. “My manifesto is to ensure devolution is strengthened and CCM is the only party fighting for the devolution of more resources,” she said.
