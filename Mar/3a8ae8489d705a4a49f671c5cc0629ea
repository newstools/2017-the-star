Chief Justice David Maraga has termed as false claims by politicians that the Judiciary meddles in the national and county assemblies&rsquo; affairs.He said the Judiciary cannot stop Parliament and county executives from discharging their mandate unless they fail to follow the law when carrying out their work.He said when impeaching any leader, the legal procedures must be followed at every stage and failure to do this will render the whole exercise null and void.The CJ said Article 165 gives the High Court powers to intervene when due process on legislation or impeachment is not followed.&ldquo;At times I&rsquo;m surprised because the statements have been issued by lawyers,&rdquo; he said.Maraga spoke on Thursday when he closed the Second Annual Legislative Summit at Pride Inn Hotel, Mombasa.National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi said he will appeal the order stopping the hearing of a petition seeking the removal of Auditor General Edward Ouko.He said attempts by the High Court to stop the House from discussing the petition are premature.
