A magistrate was dismayed by the absence of former anti-corruption czar John Githongo, who was to testify against former Finance minister David Mwiraria, three former PSs and three businessmen in the Anglo-leasing case. Githongo's absence caused adjournment. Milimani magistrate Felix Kombo said &ldquo;he had ample time to notify the prosecution&rdquo; he would not be available. The court heard that the witness skipped the attendance because he was out of the country.
