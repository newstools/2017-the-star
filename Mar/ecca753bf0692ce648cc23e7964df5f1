Poor infrastructure and many private schools are to blame for low education levels in Nyandarua county. This came up during a meeting on Monday between leaders and board members of Raichiri Primary School, Ndaragwa, in Naivasha. Addressing the press afterwards, Bishop David Thagana from Glory Outreach Assembly said something needs to be done. He said Nyandarua was once a leader in education. Thagana blamed high levels of poverty for the failing standards. "As leaders from Nyandarua we are concerned about how the levels have dropped over time. We should all work to restore the lost glory," he said. Thagana praised the government for scrapping exam fees for both private and public schools. "[This] means we can compete in public schools and achieve the much-desired results," he said. Thagana said Raichiri Primary is in bad shape, with a few dilapidated classrooms. "To address some of the challenges in that school the board meeting today has decided to bring together all alumni to chip in and construct new classes," he said. Board's chairman Rev Lawrence Ndung'u said, "Ndaragwa constituency is a very poor area and the parents cannot afford to build even one classroom. That is why we are calling on former students to help us construct modern classrooms." Thagana said despite the school being in a rural and poor setting it has produced brilliant minds who now want to be involved in its refurbishment.
