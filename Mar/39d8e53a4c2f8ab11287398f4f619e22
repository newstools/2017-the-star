Taxpayers could save or lose Sh3 billion in the Thwake Dam project from a decision Water and Irrigation PS Patrick Mwangi will make in awarding a contract to one of two disputed companies.Water CS Eugene Wamalwa and a parliamentary committee yesterday told Mwangi to choose between the two firms, but warned he will be held to account for any loss of public funds. As the accounting officer, the PS has the final say on who gets the Sh62.3 billion contract for the multi-purpose dam project.There has been controversy in awarding the contract for the project&rsquo;s phase one implementation between two evaluated firms &ndash; China Gezhouba Construction Group Corporation at a cost of Sh36.9 billion and Sinohydro Tianjin Engineering Co Ltd at Sh39.5 billion.The PS has insisted Sinohydro should get the contract, arguing that Gezhouba had been blacklisted by the African Development Bank.But yesterday it emerged that Sinohydro was on June 28 last year blacklisted by the World Bank for one year for suspected bribes to government officials. &ldquo;The Sanctions Board found that it was more likely than not that the respondent had recklessly misrepresented commissions paid or to be paid to an agent in order to influence the procurement process for a World Bank-financed contract,&rdquo; James Spinner, chairperson of the World Bank Group Sanctions Board, wrote to Sinohydro on June 29 last year.Firm clearedDocuments before the committee show that AfDB had already cleared China Gezhouba and lifted its suspension.Implementation of the Ukambani-based project to benefit Makueni and Kitui counties is among the Vision 2030 flagship projects. It was to kick off in September 2013, but it has been delayed due to a myriad of controversies in procurement.&ldquo;I have advised the PS, the Attorney General, AfDB and the EACC have also advised him. There is no need for this committee to spend a lot of time cracking its head on the procurement mandate given to an institution,&rdquo; Wamalwa said.He added, &ldquo;Even in the Bible, the Son of God during His lowest time prayed and said remove this cup from me. He [PS] took the cup to me, the Attorney General, the EACC, and AfDB, but it was returned to him. This committee should also return the cup to him. The decision of this committee is important as to whether this project will collapse or stand.&rdquo;The ministry&rsquo;s Tender Evaluation Committee recommended the tender be awarded to lowest bidder, China Gezhouba.The Ministerial Tender Committee appointed in February this year by Mwangi overruled the recommendations in favour of the second lowest bidder, Sinohydro Tianjin Engineering Ltd.The Ministerial Tender Committee rejected China Gezhouba on grounds it had integrity issues and had been debarred.No objectionHowever, African Development Bank, funding 35 per cent of the cost, wrote to the ministry informing the PS and his committee it granted a &ldquo;no-objection&rdquo; recommendation for the company after scrutinising it.AfDB director general for Eastern Africa Regional Centre Gabriel Negatu informed the ministry that 18 months of debarment placed on Gezhouba&rsquo;s subsidiary firm, Gezhouba Group No 1 Engineering, expired in October last year, before the deadline for submission of bids on December 21 last year.&ldquo;The bank has noted that this does not apply to this particular case since this particular bidder or its subsidiaries do not appear in the bank&rsquo;s list of debarred firms. For the list of debarred firms, you may refer to the AfDB website,&rdquo; Negatu said.Wamalwa told the National Assembly Agriculture committee chaired by Adan Nooru (Mandera North) that Attorney General Githu Muigai also issued an advisory opinion of &ldquo;no-objection&rdquo; in awarding the lowest bidder the contract as required by the law and procurement regulations.In his legal opinion, the AG also warns the Ministry of the risk of the project failing if AfDB makes good its threat to reallocate its funding to other projects.The CS also told the committee that the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission recommended the ministry proceed with awarding the tender to Gezhouba after failing to establish any integrity issues with China Gezhouba.Mwangi has been expecting the parliamentary committee to pronounce itself on the matter as the last arbiter and he will be forced to decide on his own in issuing the contract while vowing to &ldquo;keenly watch the decision the PS will make.&rdquo;Nooru told Wamalwa that his committee on Wednesday advised Mwangi that he should &ldquo;strictly&rdquo; observe the procurement laws and regulations in awarding the contract.
