President Uhuru Kenyatta returns to the Coast today for his third tour in five months to launch projects and hunt for votes. The visit will also gauge whether Coast allegiance is likely to tilt away from the opposition and toward Jubilee.Uhuru&rsquo;s Coast visits, especially in Mombasa, have always caused tension and often confrontation between him and Governor Hassan Joho.The governor has several times accused the President of taking credit for projects not initiated by the national government.With just five months until the August 8 elections, Uhuru&rsquo;s will tour five counties until Sunday. The trip will end with a rally at Tononoka Grounds, Mombasa.Senior communications director at State House Munyori Buku said Uhuru will visit Lamu, Kilifi, Kwale, Taita Taveta and Mombasa. &ldquo;Tentatively that&rsquo;s the programme, but it may be adjusted depending on other factors,&rdquo; Munyori told the Star on the phone.Joho and Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi have said Jubilee cannot take over the Coast since it is a Cord zone that voted overwhelmingly for the opposition in 2013. The President was in Mombasa from Christmas Eve last year and stayed &lsquo;indoors&rsquo; up to the new year.He then toured regions and commissioned projects, including the Buxton footbridge, which sparked controversy between him and the county government.Kilifi North MP Gideon Munga&rsquo;ro said Uhuru will commission the construction of the 135km Lamu-Witu-Garsen Highway Road in Witu town.The road, which is the main entry point to Lamu, has been dilapidated since Independence.The Sh10.4 billion tender for the road construction was awarded to China Wu Yi Construction Company in 2016.The completed road will open up Lamu county for more and bigger industrial and economic investment.The projects will include the Sh2.5 trillion Lamu Port-South Sudan-Ethiopia-Transport Corridor at Kililana, the Sh200 billion coal-fired power plant at Kwasasi and the Sh21 billion wind power project at Baharini in Mpeketoni.Deputy county commissioner Stephen Sangolo has said all is set to receive the President.He said security is adequate all county leaders have been notified.&ldquo;The President will be at Witu between 9am and 10am. He will launch the road project after which he shall fly out to another county,&rdquo; Sangolo said.Uhuru visited the Coast after the African Union meeting in Addis Ababa last month.He issued IDs to the previously stateless Makonde community and won votes.This was shortly after the extradition of the Akasha brothers and two foreigners to the United States on January 31 to face drug trafficking and related charges.Uhuru talked tough on rampant drug use and sales and announced another crackdown.He also had declared all-out war on drugs on August 27, 2015. He said no one would be spared, but not much happened.Mung&rsquo;aro said Uhuru is expected to commission water projects in Magarini and Kilifi North and the tarmacking of the Malindi-Salagate road.&ldquo;He will be in Taita Taveta and Kwale for similar road projects. This region must enjoy proper infrastructure that can only be delivered by Jubilee,&rdquo; Munga&rsquo;ro said.He said the President would tour Kakuyuni for the water project.Uhuru will also launch other projects, including the Sh2.7 billion tarmacking of 113km from Kakuyuni to Gongoni.
