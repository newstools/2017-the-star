The experienced trio of Hudson Chesoli, captain Ibrahim Odour and Dennis Mokua were equally impressive in their respective departments, catapulting Prisons to win the first two sets 25-20 and 15-19. The side, coached by Gideon Chenje, then stalled as the Central Africans overtook them to take two consecutive sets 25-22 and 23-25 to set up a tie breaker. The only Kenyan representative at the annual championship led 8-4 as teams switched sides before they extended the lead to bag 15-13 win in the final set. Prisons will now face Esperance of Tunisia in the fifth and sixth position today after winning against Ssarya of Libya 25-18, 25-13, 25-13. Prisons will head into today’s match well aware that they have made a remarkable improvement in this year’s event after they finished in the 11th position in their last oiting in 2015. Prisons captain Odour said they will give the tie the best shot. “It was a tough match but I am glad we were the eventual winners.
