Opposition chief Raila Odinga yesterday said the August 8 polls will not be won on a tribal card, saying he will raid Jubilee strongholds for votes.He said no political grouping should lay claim to owning a certain region as its vote basket under wraps. Raila has led other NASA bosses Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper), Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula (Ford Kenya) and Musalia Mudavadi of ANC in storming perceived Jubilee strongholds where they have addressed huge crowds.Last week, NASA leaders were in Eldoret. They then pitched camp in Meru and Tharaka Nithi counties for two days in a vote-hunt mission.Yesterday, Raila said Kenyans are more informed about the kind of leadership they want. He heads to Wajir county today. &ldquo;There is nothing like this is my vote basket. This is a Kikuyu, Luo, Luyha or Kalenjin basket. All Kenyans have seen the light,&rdquo; the ODM leader said.Raila said Kenyans&rsquo; disillusionment with the Jubilee regime is palpable, given that the ruling alliance has failed to address serious challenges. He named the problems as insecurity, doctors&rsquo; strike and corruption. &ldquo;Kenyans have made a decision to join NASA because all of them whether Jubilee or NASA share the same plight of unemployment, insecurity and inflation,&rdquo; Raila said.Speaking at Orange House, he said the opposition will sell its agenda to all Kenyans wherever they are across the country without fear. &ldquo;We will storm all regions, our friends from Baringo have invited us and we will be there because NASA is a national movement,&rdquo; he said.The opposition chief spoke when he received Kennedy Ayabei who defected from Jubilee to challenge Kanu chairman Gideon Moi for Baringo senator.Kanu last week announced it would support President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s second term bid.The move ended the Independence party&rsquo;s dalliance with NASA.
