Nyaribari Chache parliamentary hopeful Zaheer Jhanda wants to become the first non-local to be elected MP in Kisii county. He seeks to unseat incumbent Richard Tong’i on the Kanu ticket. The youthful aspirant first ran for the seat in 2013 on the URP ticket and lost to Chris Bichange. He supported Tong’i in a by-election in 2014. “In 2013, I was still a greenhorn in politics. I have come of age and will give my opponents a run for their money,” he told the Star on Wednesday. “The people of Nyaribari Chache see me as one of their own. I was born and raised in Kisii town.” Others seeking the seat are former MPs Bichange of ODM and Robert Monda, Rachel Otundo of KNC and Ben Mogaka of KSC.
