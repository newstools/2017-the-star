The Employment and Labour Relations Court has suspended plans by the government to hire 500 doctors from Tanzania.Justice Nelson Abuodha issued the temporary orders yesterday after a group of doctors told the court the decision to employ non- Kenyan medical practitioners was illegal.Certifying the suit as urgent, the judge directed the doctors to serve the Health and Interior CSs, the Council of Governors, the Public Service Commission and the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union with the suit papers within 21 days. &ldquo;Let this matter be mentioned on April 19 for further directions. In the meantime leave is hereby granted to operate as stay against the respondent,&rdquo; reads parts of the ruling.Doctors Lilian Magara, Okware Oriema, Victor Mutisya and Adrian Flavian further said both the national and county governments ought to have considered the availability of the more than 1,000 jobless Kenyan doctors before turning to foreigners.The doctors said Kenyans ought to have been given first priority of employment and deployment, as outlined in the Constitution.&ldquo;The government ought to have considered the availability of persons with comparable skills locally before going ahead with the recruitment exercise&rdquo; Magara said in an affidavit.HIRING DONE IN BAD FAITHThe doctor said the decision to hire foreigners is unlawful and was made in bad faith.&ldquo;It is unreasonable, improper, oppressive, malicious and an abuse of power,&rdquo; the doctors states.According to the practitioners, the country has doctors with comparable skills to engage in local employment.The doctors are seeking several orders, among them one that will compel the government to absorb 1,400 medical practitioners who are currently jobless, but are trained and qualified.They also want the state completely blocked from hiring foreign doctors as well as other medical practitioners.The contention of the doctors is the decision to import doctors from Tanzania fails to meet the threshold as prescribed by law. Health CS Dr Cleopa Mailu recently defended the government&rsquo;s decision to employ foreign doctors, saying it will help address the current shortage and improve doctor-patient ratio.
