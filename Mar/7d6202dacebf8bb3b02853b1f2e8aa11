Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi has dismissed reports that he is being probed by EACC over the loss of Sh1 billion at the county.He said on Wednesday that claims of anti-graft agency investigating possible misuse and wastage of the county's billions are false.In a press statement, Kingi termed the allegations as part of a wider scheme by his competitors to discredit his reelection bid."We are not under any investigation on corruption allegations as claimed in the media," the statement reads in part.The media report showed that Kingi is under probe following the purchase of the 11-acre Mtwapa bus park and market land.The county, according to the reports, inflated the cost of an acre of land to Sh28 million up from the market rates of Sh3 million.Kilifi was also reported to have lost Sh1.8 billion and not Sh51 million to Nairobi-based companies."We confirmed that only Sh51 million was irregularly paid to the companies. EACC had even seized of the matter," Kingi said.He further clarified that the Sh1.8 billion payments made by the county were genuine and had been verified.In December last year, three suspects believed to have defrauded the county of Sh51 million were charged with conspiracy to commit a crime.Lucy Kibogo (Zohali Services), Sarah Kamau (Daima One Enterprises) and Stephen Ngunzi (Kilingi investments) denied the charges.Kilifi senior resident magistrate Leah Wasighe released them on Sh5 million bond or Sh1 million cash bail each.Read: Three suspects charged in Kilifi's Sh51 million scamAlso read: Mungatana at EACC over Sh51 million Kilifi county scamMore on this: Kilifi county denies loss of Sh1.18 billionOn Mtwapa land, Kingi said the government's valuation put the price at Sh310 million but the county awarded the tender to Future Links which quoted Sh308 million."In a bid to promote transparency, the county engaged a private valuer, who valued the same land at Sh 295 million," he said.The claim was that the bus park payments were wired to 10 different entities.
