Governors yesterday warned the Foreign Affairs ministry that they will sue it if it fails to help them get US visas.Council of Governors chairman Peter Munya in a statement to media said the directive by CS Amina Mohamed that all county officials no longer qualify for official visa is &ldquo;discriminatory and unconstitutional&rdquo;.&ldquo;It is the Foreign Affairs ministry that issues diplomatic notes for foreign missions in Kenya for travel by state officers, hence it is discriminatory and unconstitutional for it to deny diplomatic notes to a section of [constitutionally recognised] state office holders,&rdquo; the letter addressed to the principal secretaries in the ministries of Foreign Affairs and Devolution says.&ldquo;To this end,CoG demands that you accord county government officials the facilitation and assistance they require when travelling for official functions in the US and other foreign countries. Note that noncooperation on your part in fulfilling these legal obligations will attract a court challenge from CoG.&rdquo;On February 14, the Foreign Affairs ministry wrote to the counties indicating that the US Embassy in Nairobi will no longer issue official visas (category A). Instead, county officers will be issued with visitor visas, which are category B1-B2 . Visitor visas are nonimmigrant visas for people who want to enter the United States temporarily for business (visa category B1), tourism, pleasure or visiting (visa category B2), or a combination of both purposes (B1-B2).The ministry said the officials will only be issued with category A visas if they are on national government business. Those travelling for county government business will not qualify for the official visa, whether they are on diplomatic passports or not. This means they will follow the normal visa application procedures, which includes physical appearance at the embassy for payment of visa fees, interviews, and fingerprints. But Munya said Article 260 of the Constitution categorises governors, deputy governors, MCAs and CECs as state officers and therefore the national government should facilitate their travel outside the country.&ldquo;The Constitution provides that the governments at national and county levels are interdependent and should conduct their mutual relations on the basis of consultation and cooperation,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;In this regard, national and county governments should work in mutual cooperation to ensure their powers and functions as outlined under the Fourth Schedule of the Constitution are fulfilled.&rdquo;
