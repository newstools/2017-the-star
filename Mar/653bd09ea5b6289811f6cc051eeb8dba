Devolution CS Mwangi Kiunjuri has lashed out at Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho for using fake documents to get to university.Kiunjuri said it is unfortunate that even opposition leader Raila Odinga is glorifying the behaviour of such leaders.He spoke during the launch of the policy on the devolved system of government.Kiunjuri said leaders should be faithful when it comes to matters of integrity.&ldquo;If you got a D- you should be happy with your grades but ashamed that you forged other credentials without even bothering to do any bridging courses,&rdquo; he said.Joho has been under attack following a series of reports that he allegedly used fake documents to apply for a Bachelor of Commerce degree at the University of Nairobi in 2009.The development into Joho&rsquo;s case open up criminal liability on the part of the governor known for taking on President Uhuru Kenyatta.He may be shut out of the Mombasa governor race if his degree certificates are invalidated. Governors are required by law to be university graduates.Lands CS Jacob Kimenyi said if leaders can observe the law, there will be fewer cases of fake certificates and degrees.As a university chancellor for nine years, Kaimenyi said it is impossible for one to be admitted for any course with a D-.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s high time we searched our hearts and did the right thing. You can&rsquo;t fight something that is unlawful. Engaging in acts of forgery to fraudulently acquire things is wrong,&rdquo; he said.Kiunjuri was with Mining CS Dan Kazungu and Garissa Governor Nathif Jama.
