The attackers who stormed the Westgate Shopping Mall on September 21, 2013 mercilessly sprayed children with bullets at a party on the top floor, a Nairobi court heard yesterday.Charles Ogeto, a senior superintendent attached to the Anti-Terrorism Police Unit, told Milimani law courts chief magistrate Francis Andayi the four gunmen&rsquo;s sole intention was to kill everyone in the building, not to steal.He said the gunmen entered the main gate of the mall and first threw two grenades at the people seated outside, before splitting into two and stationing themselves at the main entrance, while a group attacked the children.&ldquo;The two attackers who entered the mall through the parking area which was on the top floor killed children mercilessly before they proceeded to the lower floors,&rdquo; the witness said.He said the attackers arrived at the mall in a grey saloon car, registration number KAS 575X.The witness testified in a case in which Mohammed Abdi, Adan Dheq, Abdullah Omar and Hassan Mustafa are accused of assisting the mall attackers.Sixty-seven people were killed during the attack.The witness, led by senior state counsel James Warui, said, &ldquo;There were several senior officers involved in the investigations from foreign countries, namely Norway, the American Federal Bureau of Investigations, Uganda and others.&rdquo;The witness said Norway is of special interest as one of the attackers who died at the mall had called accomplices in the country and had travelled to many countries prior to the incident.He said after the operation to secure the mall mounted by Kenyan security forces, crucial recoveries were made, including burnt AK-47 rifles, five SIM cards, the car used by the terrorists, shredded papers and an incomprehensible Safaricom form.&ldquo;At the back of one of the Safaricom forms, there was some writing - I am not for anything sorry my people, all my parents I can request five things, one, to pay to that... pray other prayers to Allah, to go to ....to go the travellers ,&rdquo; the witness said.The officer said initial reports of a robbery at the mall were disputed after the attackers started throwing grenades and attacking the children and other people.
