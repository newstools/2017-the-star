Kenyans living abroad have sued the IEBC for locking them out of the August polls, in another hurdle for the crowded electoral timelines.Only Kenyans holding valid passports and living in the East African Community and South Africa will be allowed register and to vote in this election because of logistical challenges.The Kenya Diaspora Alliance filed suit on Tuesday to compel the IEBC to register them as voters.The initial voter listing was to include Kenyans livng in many countries, but it was cancelled at the 11thhour by the new IEBC team led by Wafula Chebukati. The commission cited logistical constraints.Registration ended on Tuesday in Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda and Burundi.KDA global chairman Shem Ochuodho told the Star they are pushing for contempt proceedings against the IEBC for deliberately failing to implement a Supreme Court directive. The Supreme Court in May 2015 said the polls agency should put in place necessary infrastructure to ensure Kenyans in the diaspora register and vote.Ochuodho said many Kenyans, even in the five African countries, were disfranchised because the IEBC made it mandatory for applicants to have valid passports. A passport is not a requirement to travel to some EAC countries.&ldquo;Every Kenyan who was coming with an ID to register was being chased away because they didn&rsquo;t have regular passports...The diaspora went to court for contempt and to compel the IEBC to respect and implement the Supreme Court decisions,&rdquo;Ochuodho said. The High Court has fixed the hearing date for March 21, but the KDA is pushing for an earlier date. &ldquo;We are working on an appeal and ask the matter be heard urgently,&rdquo; Ochuodho said.The KDA chairman has previously challenged President Uhuru Kenyatta, Cord leader Raila Odinga and ANC boss Musalia Mudavadi to state whether they want Kenyans abroad to vote. &ldquo;We are also taking the battle to the doorstep of the President,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Whenever he has been abroad, he has told the diaspora, you are my 48th county, you are my richest county, my government cannot ignore you. We are not seeing this now.&rdquo;
