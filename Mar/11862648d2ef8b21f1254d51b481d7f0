The Garissa University College will mark the second anniversary of the 2015 attack on Sunday.One hundred and forty eight people, the majority of them students, were killed during the April 2 attack by al Shabaab.Seventy-nine people were injured. The attack started at around 5.30am. Two unarmed guards were killed at the entrance before the attackers proceeded. College principal Ahmed Warfa yesterday said security has been tightened. There is a police post inside the institution manned by 42 officers, 24 hours a day. A biometric identification device has also been placed at the entrance of the college, restricting strangers from accessing the institution.The perimeter wall under construction will be completed by the end of April or in early May. The university administration will remove all grilles in the hostels so students can easily escape to safety in case of an emergency.Warfa said the institution has introduced lectures on radicalisation to prevent students from being brainwashed by militants. There are 585 students at the college and 200 live on campus.A staffer who sought anonymity said the institution should do away with anniversaries because they bring back bad memories.&ldquo;The anniversaries traumatise students and scare away those considering enrolling at the college. They should gradually be done away with to give the university closure to move on,&rdquo; he said.
