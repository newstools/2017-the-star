A parliamentary team was yesterday divided on whether foreigner traders who suffered losses during the 2007-08 post-election violence should be compensated first before their Kenyan counterparts.MPs in National Assembly Committee on Administration and National Security were inquiring into a petition by Ugandan and Rwandese traders.The traders are seeking Sh538 million compensation.They had different views with some maintained the government should pay locals, before the foreign nationals.The amount traders demanded initially was Sh4.7 billion, but they reduced it to Sh538 million following Attorney General Githu Muigai's revelation that most of the claims were questionable. &ldquo;An inter-ministerial committee established that some of the claims were fake and only Sh538 million of the claims were found to be verifiable. The matter is now before the Cabinet,&rdquo; Githu said.Homa Bay Town MP Peter Kaluma said, &ldquo;The mention of PEV causes tears to many Kenyans, including IDPs, returnees, those with dead relatives and the maimed who should first be compensated as a matter of public interest before the government can deal with non-Kenyans.&rdquo;Muigai warned that failing to settle losses suffered by citizens of EA nations will compel relevant countries to raise the matter under the East African protocol and Kenya could be held responsible for violating the laid down laws.&ldquo;The country seems not to learn its lesson because 15 years after failing to pay the Anglo Leasing by claimants it was forced to do so after it decided to float the Eurobond. If we bury our heads in the sand, we could in future be forced to settle the payment when the country decided to float an international instrument in future,&rdquo; he said.Committee chairman Asman Kamama (Tiaty) asked the state to pursue a &ldquo;win-win situation&rdquo; for Kenyans and citizens of regional countries to be compensated for losses they suffered.Treasury Director General of Budget and Economic Affairs Geoffrey Mwau, however, pointed out that there is no policy direction on how to settle such payments. He said the matter has to be forwarded to cabinet and that Parliament would appropriate the funds once the issue is approved by cabinet.Mwau also called for a &ldquo;clear framework&rdquo; to deal with such compensation in the region because the losses are happening every day in the various East African countries, not just the 2008 skirmishes.
