The National Drought Management Authority has given out Sh2 million to feed more than 300,000 Pokot North and Pokot Central residents suffering in the drought. They the money will buy water, food, and fodder for livestock. Speaking to the press at Nyangaita, Pokot Central, on Friday county NDMA officer Tim Letooyia said about 60,000 households have lost almost all livestock and depend solely on relief food. He said the authority with the European Union has completed the first phase of distributing food and water. A spot check by the Star revealed a grim picture of the drought-stricken subcounties with livestock carcasses littering the area. The NDMA gave one 5,000-litre water tank to Nyangaita Primary School to increase storage. Letooyia said more tanks have been distributed in the two subcounties. “The dry spell is worst in Pokot North and Pokot Central. Water bowsers have been sent to the two subcounties and we are filling all available tanks,” the officer said. He said some rivers and dams are almost dry as pastoralists lose their livelihoods. “The small rivers feeding the mains ones have dried up, posing serious threats to human beings and livestock,” Letooyia said.
