Former Lands CS Charity Ngilu is finally free after a criminal charge against her, relating to a Sh8 billion Karen land scandal, was yesterday terminated.She forgave her detractors, whom she did not name.&ldquo;I told you I was clean. I have forgiven my aggressors as I knew from the beginning that the case would be withdrawn . It is over now. Let me move on with my life.&ldquo;There is no doubt the events have been aimed at smearing my character, reputation and long public service. What stood between my detractors and me is the truth,&rdquo; she said.Ngilu was removed from the Cabinet based on the suit. The charge sheet said Ngilu on June 19, 2015 obstructed investigations into 134 acres in Karen, Nairobi.She said the Karen land was double-allocated to one Horatius da Gama Rose of Muchanga Investments and Jos Konzolo of Telesource.com Limited before her tenure at Ardhi House.&ldquo;This happened long before I became Lands Cabinet secretary,&rdquo; she said.The Karen land along Hillcrest Road and the Southern Bypass, is estimated to be worth about Sh8 billion.The case against Ngilu was terminated by the state before chief magistrate Lawerence Mugambi of the Milimani Anti-Corruption Court. This followed an agreement by both the prosecution and the politician that was recorded at the Court of Appeal.Her lawyer, senior counsel Paul Muite, presented original Court of Appeal orders issued on March 6, in which appellate judges Alnashir Visram, Wanjiru Karanja and Jamila Mohamed declared Ngilu&rsquo;s trial unconstitutional and directed the Anti-Corruption Court to terminate the charge.Muite said the orders were reached by consent, hence this automatically supported termination of the case.&ldquo;The purpose of this mention is to hand over the original copy of the Court of Appeal orders and to request to formally terminate the criminal case against Hon Ngilu,&rdquo; Muite told the trial court. The charge sheet was amended.
