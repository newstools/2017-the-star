Kiambu Governor William Kabogo has denied allegations that the county government has blocked NASA from holding a rally at Thika Stadium. He said claims that the county ordered the group locked out of the grounds is 'part of the larger National Super Alliance propaganda machinery'. Kabogo said NASA was free to visit and hold rallies in the county on grounds
that they do not misbehave. "We love visitors. They can come and spend their money in our good county," the governor told journalists on Wednesday. "But let them be advised against causing trouble as Kiambu people will stop them," he said. Kiambu Sports executive Machel Waikenda had said on Tuesday that the stadium was closed for renovations. NASA, while in Eldoret last weekend, announced plans to hold its maiden rally in Central at the stadium on
Saturday.

Kabogo further accused NASA of using propaganda to discredit the independent electoral and boundaries commission. He said the group was mounting accusations of vote rigging against IEBC since they have sensed August 8 poll defeat. "Raila should know he is an experienced loser. That is why they are hyping the public to think that Jubilee will rig elections," he said. "NASA is
all about power-sharing. They know that they will
automatically lose the election," Kabogo said. He said that the opposition leaders have no interest of Kenyans
at heart compared to Jubilee which is keen on improving lives. "NASA leaders are experts in complaining just about everything and offering nothing," Kabogo said. "People
like Kalonzo have been in government for over 30
years yet have nothing to show for their worth," he said. In regards to Kiambu politics, Kabogo said none of his competitors can match him. "We are far apart, they cannot match my game," he said.
