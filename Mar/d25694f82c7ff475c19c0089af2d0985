A huge snow storm which battered the US yesterday, killing at least two people, is now heading for the UK.Storm Stella brought more than 2ft of snow and 70mph winds along the north-east coast of America, cutting off power for many and causing travel chaos.More than 8,000 flights were cancelled, including dozens from the UK to New York, Washington and Boston.The storm will work its way across the Atlantic and is set to hit Britain tomorrow with gale force winds of up to 50mph.The Met Office said it may issue wind warnings in the North West, but that the storm will be weaker than in the US.Six states were put under a state of emergency including New York and Connecticut. Drivers were banned from the roads and schools shut. In Milwaukee, Wisconsin, two elderly men died after collapsing while shovelling snow.Stella dumped 30 inches of snow on the Hudson Valley, the worst affected area.Met Office forecaster Emma Sharples said tomorrow the UK would see the &lsquo;remnants&rsquo; of Stella, which will lose strength as it crosses the Atlantic.She said that after mild weather earlier this week, it will become cooler and windier, with up to 60mm of rain between Friday and Saturday.
