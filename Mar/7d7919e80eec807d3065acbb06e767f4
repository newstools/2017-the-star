A section of Wiper MPs has dismissed claims party leader Kalonzo Musyoka will bolt from NASA if he is not declared the opposition presidential candidate.The lawmakers from Ukambani on Friday said the remarks by National Assembly minority leader Francis Nyenze were his &ldquo;personal views&rdquo;, not the party&rsquo;s position.&ldquo;The comments have caused a lot of anxiety and we want to put the record straight. The comments were Nyenze&rsquo;s democratic right, but they are not representative of Wiper,&rdquo; Kathiani MP Robert Mbui said.&ldquo;Wiper can only speak through its internal organs and party leader,&rdquo; he said. Mbui is Wiper organising secretary.He spoke at Parliament Buildings alongside Machakos woman representative Susan Musyoka and Mavoko MP Patrick Makau.Homa Bay MP Peter Kaluma was also present.&ldquo;Nyenze spoke out of excitement. There is nothing wrong with saying Kalonzo should be named the NASA presidential candidate, but we are in NASA to stay. We are not about to move,&rdquo; Musyoka said.Nyenze, she said, should have raised issues in the National Coordinating Committee, where he represents the party on the team tasked to pick the presidential flagbearer.On Wednesday, Nyenze said Wiper will walk out of NASA if Kalonzo is not picked the flagbearer in seven days.He asked ODM leader Raila Odinga to honour a 2013 MoU signed with Kalonzo. They had agreed Raila would be a one-term President, then back Kalonzo for President in 2017.
