The Senate resumes its sittings today amid mounting pressure from governors and MCAs to pass Bills that will give the next set set of governors and MCAs a smooth take-off.The Senate will focus on the County Allocation of Revenue Bill and just like the budget, the timelines for the passage of the Bill have been changed to factor in the August election.The House will also be keen on ensuring key laws touching on devolution are passed.The Bills tracker published by the Senate on March 6, the House, since its inception in 2013, has handled 125 bills, most of which have been recorded to have lapsed, while others were passed by senators but gathered dust in the National Assembly.Late last year, senators threatened not to pass legislation from the National Assembly unless it fastracked their Bills.Eleven Bills are currently pending for first reading and with less than four months to the election, they are likely not to see the light of day.Of the 70 petitions that have been filed in the Senate since March 2013, only 31 have been dealt with and responses given to the petitioners pursuant to Standing Order 228.Essentially, the House committee which the petition is directed to has 60 days to dispense with the petition.With elections imminent, quorum hitches are bound to be experienced in the Senate from time to time, further stalling passing of crucial legislation such as The County Retirement Scheme Bill.At the close of the second Legislative Summit in Mombasa on Thursday last week, MCAs appealed to the senators to fastrack up to 10 Bills which they said hold the key to successful devolution.Among the Bills the MCAs asked the Senate to pass before end of the session in June included The County Pensions Scheme Bill, the Intergovernmental Relations (Amendment) Bill, 2014 to entrench the Council of County Assemblies in law, the Impeachment Procedure Bill, 2016 to clarify the impeachment process and the Public Participation Bill, 2016.Other Bills the 47 county assemblies want the Senate to push the National Assembly to consider and pass include County Attorneys Bill, 2014, Office of the County Printer Bill, 2014, the County Public Service Bill, Petition to County Assembly (Procedure) Bill, 2014 and the Access to Information Bill, 2016. They include Division of Revenue Bill, the County Allocation of Revenue Bill, the Kenya Roads Bill, Constitutional (Amendment) Bill, the County Boundaries Bill and the County Government (Amendment) Bill are also some of the key Bills that are expected to feature in the sittings.Others are the Physical Planning Bill and the Land Value Index (Amendment) Bill.Yesterday, Majority Whip Beatrice Elachi said she will work with her Minority counterpart Johnson Muthama to have the quorum to pass the Bills.&ldquo;We are entering a crucial stage where our legacy as a inaugural Senate will be accessed. From now henceforth we will ensure all pending business on petitions and Bills are dispensed of,&rdquo; Elachi told the Star on the phone.
