So who actually appointed Chief Justice David Maraga (pictured) to the high-profile job? This is the question some civil society activists are increasingly heard asking. In Kisii, President Uhuru Kenyatta wooed the Abagusii, saying it was payback time after &ldquo;giving you&rdquo; the CJ job. Civil society is wondering why the Judicial Service Commission has not come out to denounce Uhuru&rsquo;s claim. They say Maraga himself ought to have come out to correct the perception being created by Jubilee that he is a Presidential appointee, if only to safeguard the independence of the Judiciary. ***** Some Jubilee governors are quietly pushing for direct nominations. We are told some, who have been funding party activities, are asking the party to &ldquo;pay back &ldquo; because they have spent a lot of money and their time popularising President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s outfit. ***** Critics of Jubilee campaigns warn that the ICC narrative will not work for the August 8 election, despite the party&rsquo;s top brass pushing it for sympathy votes. Some MPs were overheard saying President Uhuru Kenyatta is trying to reintroduce the ICC narrative, as the duo did in 2013 to rally their tribesmen against Opposition Chief Raila Odinga. According to the MPs, Kenyans are now concerned about the price of Unga and the many election promises that Jubilee gave. In fact, they think that the dropping of the charges, while good for Uhuru, Ruto and their families, was bad for their politics. ***** The more than 100 staff who were appointed in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to serve in various diplomatic missions abroad may have to wait for more luck next time. Corridors understand that the appointments, which were suspended, may never be approved after all. It&rsquo;s said that some of the senior officers in the ministry recently found themselves in trouble after being asked about the training of those who had been named. It&rsquo;s understood the decision to stop the appointments was made following differences between the ministry&rsquo;s top two - and the bad blood seems to be huge trouble in Jubilee. ***** Why did the National Super Alliance shift its rally scheduled for today in the historic Uhuru Park Grounds to the informal settlement of Mathare? Well, sources whisper to Corridors that the organisers were afraid the attendance would be poor, being a weekday. Mathare has many jobless residents who cannot even afford the fare to get to town for the rally.
