A farmer in Suguta on the Samburu-Laikipia counties border is counting Sh10 million losses.A group of armed herders broke the fence, grazed their cattle on her farm at night and destroyed crops.The 10 herders were armed with guns, spears and clubs. They destroyed the electric fence and two other fences before they sneaked in their livestock.They scared off the caretaker who left at around 9pm.&ldquo;I found about 200 head of cattle being grazed on the crops. The owners were angered when I questioned them, and I had to run for my life,&rdquo; Wilson Lenyakopiro said.Lydia Lengees said she lost onions, tomatoes, nappier grass, bananas and watermelons.The herders also vandalised her property, she says.&ldquo;I cannot believe that my green garden is now an empty field. The cattle ate everything. The herders have also destroyed pipes that supplied water to our homestead,&rdquo; she said. Residents want the national government to take action against the herders.
