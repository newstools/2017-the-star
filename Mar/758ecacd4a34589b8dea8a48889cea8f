The wife of Westminster terrorist Khalid Masood spoke for the first time today to say she is "saddened and shocked" by his actions.Rohey Hydara spoke out after Masood's mother, Janet Ajao, said she had 'shed many tears' for her son's victims.In a statement released through the Metropolitan Police, Hydara said: 'I am saddened and shocked by what Khalid has done. I totally condemn his actions."I express my condolences to the families of the victims that have died, and wish a speedy recovery to all the injured."I would like to request privacy for our family, especially the children, at this difficult time."Masood got behind the wheel of a rented Hyundai 4x4 and drove at speeds of up to 76mph as he ploughed into victims on Westminster Bridge on Wednesday last week.His attack took a mere 82 seconds but left four people dead and more than 50 injured.The British-born jihadi, 52, was on Whatsapp at 2.37pm, approximately two minutes before hitting people on the bridge and four minutes before he was shot dead by armed officers outside the Palaces of Westminster.He stabbed PC Keith Palmer to death with two knives outside parliament after killing 43-year-old mother-of-two Aysha Frade, 75-year-old Londoner Leslie Rhodes, and US tourist Kurt Cochran, 54, as he ploughed along a crowded pavement on Westminster Bridge.ISIS initially claimed responsibility for its first attack on British soil and said the crazed knifeman was its 'soldier', but yesterday police insisted Masood was not linked to the terror group.Scotland Yard said the British-born jihadi copied ISIS techniques but there was no evidence he was in contact with them.Yesterday, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu revealed more about the investigation into the attack. He said: "His attack method appears to be based on low sophistication, low tech, low cost techniques copied from other attacks, and echo the rhetoric of IS (Islamic State) leaders in terms of methodology and attacking police and civilians, but at this stage I have no evidence he discussed this with others."Whilst I have found no evidence of an association with ISIS or al-Qaeda, there is clearly an interest in jihad."
