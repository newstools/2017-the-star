Kilifi Senator Stewart Madzayo on Wednesday condemned what he called continuous persecution by the state of its fierce critic, Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho.Madzayo said Joho is being harassed to silence him from speaking his mind.&ldquo;If Joho has admitted that he did not do well in his KCSE exam but he worked hard to be where he is today, what else do they want from him?&rdquo; he told the Star.Joho could be charged with forging a KCSE exam result slip for admission to the University of Nairobi.Officers handling the case told the Star in confidence that the file will be forwarded to the DPP for action.Detectives at the Directorate of Criminal Investigations said they are almost finalising the probe.Madzayo said it is ironic that the few individuals trying to silence Joho are making him popular. &ldquo;Every person now wants to know who this Joho is and yearn to shake his hand,&rdquo; he said.It is unfair for the government to question Joho&rsquo;s papers, yet there are other politicians whose academic papers are questionable, Madzayo said. &ldquo;Joho admitted he came from a poor background, meaning he did not enjoy the things a student needs to pass his exams,&rdquo; he said. He said Joho is a living example of those who did not do well in their examination but are successful today.
