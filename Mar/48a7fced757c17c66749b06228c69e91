The Inter-religious Council of Kenya will participate in the mediation in the doctors&rsquo; strike impasse.Through lawyers James Orengo and Philip Murgor, officials of the doctors&rsquo; union told the Court of Appeal the religious leaders might be better-placed to help end the stalemate on pay and allowances. &ldquo;The report is ready, but there have been new developments. Religious leaders have sought to take the negotiations to another level, following the mediator&rsquo;s failure to end the standoff,&rdquo; Orengo said yesterday.The final report on mediation between the Ministry of Health, Council of Governors and the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists&rsquo; Union was tabled in court.KMPDU claims it has revised its position and reviewed proposals on basic salary and allowances twice before, but the government has refused to review its position.&ldquo;We have indicated willingness to continue presenting other scenarios within this mediation process. These offers have been rejected by the government, who would rather have the strike continue than table an alternative offer,&rdquo; the union said.KMPDU said that on February 23, Health PS Nicholas Muraguri failed to appear for negotiations, and the government delegation was led by &ldquo;juniors&rdquo;.The union said the ability to progress the negotiations was hampered by the absence of CS Cleopa Mailu and Muraguri.&ldquo;The current offer by the government has been presented for more than two months now. The union&rsquo;s position has been that the offer should be improved, but hopes the mediation does not collapse,&rdquo; KMPDU said. It added, &ldquo;Our position on the previously tabled offer has not changed.&rdquo;
