Security officials in Murang&rsquo;a county have raised concerns about the rising cases of bhang smoking in the region.County Commissioner John Elungata said, &ldquo;In some villages like Ngurwe-ini in Murang&rsquo;a East, the smell of bhang is drenched in the air.&rdquo;He spoke on Friday, when Nacada chairman Julius Githiria paid him a courtesy call.Elungata said the majority of youths have turned to bhang following the crack down on illicit liquor. He said politicians supply bhang to youths to woo them into supporting them.Elungata said youths are not afraid of being arrested because they go right back to smoking bhang once released.Last month, police seized Sh300,000 bhang at a house in Maragua town.Three youths found packaging the drug were arrested. They are suspected to have been working with a major supplier.Elungata said the Aberdare Range and Mt Kenya Forest are notorious for the trade.&ldquo;Some of the bhang being sold here is suspected to have been imported from Tanzania. We are questioning some suspects,&rdquo; he said.Police commander Naomi Ichami said the majority of youths prefer to alcohol. She said a Tanzanian woman, who lives in Maragua and runs a grocery store, is suspected to be one of the main bhang suppliers in the county.&ldquo;We are investigating. The police are doing their best to minimise the usage of the drug and we need residents to volunteer information on suspicious activity,&rdquo; Ichami said.Githiria urged residents to work with the police to end drug and alcohol abuse.&ldquo;Families are being ripped apart by the these substances,&rdquo; he said.Githiria said the National Authority for the Campaign Against Alcohol and Drug Abuse is working on setting up structures to fight substance abuse in the grassroots. &ldquo;But our efforts have been frustrated because there is no clear data system,&rdquo; he said.
