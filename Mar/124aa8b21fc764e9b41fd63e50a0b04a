The Jubilee government has intensified efforts to woo Western voters ahead of the August 8 election. President Uhuru Kenyatta faces stiff competition in the region, seemingly a NASA stronghold.NASA is yet to name its flag bearer in what opposition chief Raila Odinga said on Saturday is a deliberate tact.Youth and Gender CS Sicily Kariuki was in the region on Friday and Saturday to launch the National Youth Service Empowerment Programme in Budalang'i, Navakholo and Ikolomani constituencies.This appears to be a strategy to help Jubilee secure the Western's vote as UhuRuto seek another term in office. The government also distributed relief food in Ikolomani ahead of President Uhuru Kenyatta's visit.The campaign strategy is also seen as an effort to entice voters to reelect MPs Emmanuel Wangwe (Navakholo) and Bernard Shinali (Ikolomani) who are among politicians defending their seats on the Jubilee ticket.The programmes have been launched in Jubilee-friendly constituencies.Ben Washiali, the Jubilee pointman in Kakamega county, said Uhuru will tour the region this week to inspect and launch more projects. &ldquo;The date has not been fixed but the President and his deputy will be a three-day visit; either from Thursday or Friday,&rdquo; he said.Western regional co-ordinator Mwongo Chimwanga said the date has not been confirmed.Uhuru last visited the region in December last year when he commissioned the revived Pan Paper Mill, now known as Rai Paper.He also commissioned tarmacking of Lurambi-Nambacha-Musikoma and Ibokolo-Shianda-Malaha-Nambacha roads.Wangwe and Shinali said the NYS programme will benefit the youth and make them feel part of the government.&ldquo;I am in Jubilee to stay. These developments you are seeing launched here is what a leader is elected by his people to advocate for,&rdquo; Shinali said.Wangwe and Shinali who were earlier said to be talking to Kakamega governor and ODM deputy leader Wycliffe Oparanya to switch camps denies the reports terming them mere propaganda by opponents.
