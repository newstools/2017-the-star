The man accused of the torture killing his sister after a quarrel over a bowl of Weetabix has denied the murder charge. Charles Kibe Mwaura is accused of murdering his sister Grace Nduta on January 25 at their family home Kahawa Sukari, Ruiru subcounty. Nduta’s body parts were found stuffed in a bucket hidden in the home on February 2. Other parts were found eldewhere. The 22-year-old victim was an engineering student at the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology. Kibe, who looked calm, took a plea on Monday before Justice Joel Ngugi at the High Court in Kiambu. The court did not discuss bail terms. It set a status conference for March 13. Last week Kibe was not allowed to take a plea as he lacked legal representation. He waited four days in the cells before he was provided a state lawyer. Nduta was reported missing on January 29. Police in Juja found her body parts, including her limbs and intestines, stuffed in a bucket and hidden in the ceiling of the house. Her eyes had been gouged out, her body and face were skinned and her tongue had been cut out. Kibe went into hiding at his aunt’s house in Mihang’o, Dandora, Nairobi, where he was arrested. He tried to commit suicide by stabbing himself seven times in the stomach and chest and was admitted to the Aga Khan Hospital. Police say the murder was premeditated. Kibe allegedly bought the knife he is believed to have used to stab Nduta with two days before the murder.
