Resurgent Harambee Stars extended their unbeaten run to nine matches after 1-1 draw against Ugandan Cranes in an international friendly match played at the Kenyatta Stadium in Machakos.Michael Olunga fired in the opener 10 minutes from half-time as Kenya continued their upward mobility since Stanley Okumbi took charge of the national team despite Cranes leveling matters three minutes from time courtesy of Moses Wasswa.Just like he did in the All Stars team that lost to Hull City X1, Patrick Matasi was preferred in goal with the familiar quartet of Musa Mohammed, Robinson Kamura, Brian Mandela and Aboud Omar up front.Coach Stanley Okumbi executed a twin striking partnership between Michael Olunga and Jesse Were, hoping the former international scoring streak would rub off on his compatriot.Red hot Ulinzi Stars attacker Samuel Onyango was rewarded with a starting berth after impressing in the soldiers&rsquo; Caf Cup victory over Egyptian side, Smouha. Familiar faces of Geoffrey Walusimbi and Shafique Batambuze lined up for the region&rsquo;s best outfit.Stars were comfortable with the ball early on with Teddy Akumu and Johanna Omollo giving the Cranes&rsquo; midfield the run around but clear cut chances were hard to come by as the duo played with purpose in the midfield that was short of skipper Victor Wanyama.Uganda struggled to get a stranglehold in the match and when Matasi launched a hopeful ball forward, Olunga showed his lethal left foot could still do the damage, rifling home what proved to the winner in the 35th minute.Cranes sent on Brian Majwegga for Tusker&rsquo;s Batambuze while Stars&rsquo; soon followed with a plethora of substitutions with Simon Mbugua, John Makwata and Paul Were taking the places of Musa, Noah Wafula and Olunga.Cranes were to have the last word though with Waswa sparing Cranes the blushes with the equaliser in the 87th minute. Stars now turn attention to Sunday&rsquo;s second friendly against Congo DR when Wanyama, David Owino are expected to return to the starting line up having been omitted from the match day squad yesterday.Stars line-up: Patrick Matasi, Musa Mohammed, Robinson Kamura, Brian Mandela, Aboud Omar, Anthony Akumu, Johanna Omollo, Samuel Onyango, Noah Wafula,Micahel Olunga, Jesse Were; Subs: David Okello, Simon Mbugua, Osborne Monday, Kenneth Muguna, Bernard Mangoli, John Makwatta and Paul Were
