President Uhuru Kenyatta is set to visit Turkana, Lamu, Kilifi, Mombasa and Taita Taveta counties to commission and inspect projects, State House spokesman Manoah Esipisu said yesterday. He said the projects that will be launched include the Witu-Lamu Road, Baricho Water Project and Sala Gate Road.Esipisu in a statement said the President will also commission medical equipment at Malindi Hospital and the Mariakani-Bamba Road.The head of state will also inspect the progress of the Moi Airport-Changamwe Road. &ldquo;These activities will build up to the President&rsquo;s State of the Nation Address to a Joint Sitting of Parliament on March 15. The State of the Nation Address is an opportunity to review implementation of his development agenda for the year and also to give an outlook of what he expects going forward,&rdquo; Esipisu said.He also assured Kenyans that Uhuru is committed to devolution.Esipisu said Uhuru&rsquo;s commitment is backed by evidence.He said devolved functions were handed over to the counties well ahead of schedule and the national government provided funds in terms that even exceeded the prescribed criteria. &ldquo;Constitutionally, the county governments are to be given at least 15 per cent of the total national budget. Currently, 42 per cent of the budget is allocated to the counties,&rdquo; Esipisu said.He said devolution is indeed working in the country. &ldquo;For instance in Nyeri county, Sh13 billion has been transferred to the county from the national government since 2013,&rdquo; Esipisu said.
