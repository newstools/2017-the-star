Yaya Toure believes Barcelona&rsquo;s miraculous Champions League comeback has served as a warning to Manchester City that their last-16 tie with Monaco is far from over.City are favourites to secure a place in the quarter-finals as they go into Wednesday&rsquo;s second leg at the Stade Louis II holding a 5-3 lead over Monaco after a thrilling encounter in Manchester three weeks ago.But having seen his old club Barca overturn a 4-0 deficit to beat Paris Saint-Germain 6-5 on aggregate in the greatest Champions League comeback ever, Toure insists City are not taking anything for granted.&ldquo;Our two goals are nothing for a team like Monaco, who are winning all their league games four or five nil,&rdquo; said the Ivory Coast midfielder. &ldquo;In football it&rsquo;s never enough. You saw Barcelona and PSG, I don&rsquo;t need to say any more. It was 4-0 and then it&rsquo;s 6-1.&rdquo;&ldquo;It was unbelievable. It was the sort of game you can&rsquo;t imagine. We can&rsquo;t go there relaxed. In the dressing-room, those kind of games are warnings.&rdquo;&ldquo;After the game against Stoke (last Wednesday), we went into the dressing-room and saw Barca win 6-1 and you cannot imagine how the European Cup is so serious this year. We can&rsquo;t underestimate Monaco.&rdquo;City twice fell behind in a pulsating end-to-end clash at the Etihad and Toure believes another classic could be on the cards because attack will be the best form of defence &ndash; even though Guardiola&rsquo;s side have kept a club record six clean sheets in a row away from home.Asked if City will go for a draw, he replied: &ldquo;Definitely no. We don&rsquo;t have to be in that position, otherwise we&rsquo;re going to be wrong. The best way to defend is to attack. When I watched PSG-Barcelona, PSG had fantastic players up front but they were trying to defend.&rdquo;&ldquo;When you play games like that and you are four goals in front, that is the wrong thing to do. We are going to attack, we never do it the other way. We will attack and they will expect that as well. The best defence is try to score and they know that. They will be careful with us as well.&rdquo;&ldquo;Sometimes it&rsquo;s difficult but you have to be positive because we know people are waiting for us to fail. What we have to do is try to keep going and working hard.&rdquo;
