The Jubilee Party has been asked to discipline leaders fuelling chaos in meetings.Kigumo MP Jamleck Kamau said the party's constitution stipulates that breaching peace and causing pandemonium at meetings or gatherings convened by leaders is punishable.The Murang&rsquo;a governor aspirant said some leaders are fond of using goons to disrupt meetings, and this has tainted the party's image.He spoke on Monday while distributing relief food to residents in Ithanga, Gatanga constituency.&ldquo;There are some politicians who have developed the culture of hooliganism and are using their goons to cause violence in their show of might. The party should rein in on such leaders and take the necessary action by ejecting them from the party,&rdquo; Kamau said.Kamau spoke two days after a meeting to select nine JP board members at Murang&rsquo;a Teachers Training College ended in disarray after mayhem broke out.He denied allegations that his supporters and those of Governor Mwangi Wairia clashed at the meeting.&ldquo;We all know that the Governor brought in his hooligans as he always does in meetings. The fight was between the goons and the police officers who were trying to restore sanity in the meeting,&rdquo; Kamau said.He said Wairia has panicked and has resorted to use goons.&ldquo;Actions speak a lot. He has now resorted to violence in meetings so that he can taint [the] Jubilee Party&rsquo;s name. He has sensed a defeat in the party primaries and the August election and he is doing all he can to hamper party matters in the county,&rdquo; Kamau said.In a press statement from the party secretariat on Monday, secretary general Raphael Tuju reprimanded leaders and aspirants who misbehave and cause violence in their respective regions.He said that the party will rein in on the leaders, and warned of dire consequences such as disqualification from the nominations.&ldquo;It is most illogical that we should witness all the aggression during this simple exercise,&rdquo; reads the statement.
