Infotrak was clearly paid to attempt to convince Kenyans that Jubilee is more popular than NASA, Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula has said.Infotrak on Saturday released a poll suggesting the Jubilee Party is the most popular countrywide, at 39 per cent, compared to NASA&rsquo;s 32 per cent.On Sunday the Bungoma senator rubbished the poll, which ranked him as the least popular of the four NASA principals.The poll put Raila at 68.3 per cent, Wiper&rsquo;s Kalonzo Musyoka 13.1 per cent, ANC&rsquo;s Musalia Mudavadi 12.3 and Wetang&rsquo;ula at 2.2 per cent.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Kenyans who will elect their leaders and [they will] not be influenced by polls,&rdquo; Wetang&rsquo;ula said. He was addressing rallies in Bisunu, Tulienge and Kosiandeti in Sirisia constituency.Kalonzo was of the same opinion on Sunday. He said Kenya&rsquo;s opinion polls are fake and engineered by corrupt organisations to please their corrupt bosses in NASA and Jubilee.Some Jubilee and NASA leaders fund these polls to undermine the popularity of some leaders, he said.Wetang&rsquo;ula said, &ldquo;We know what they are up to by coming up with doctored opinion polls to try and change the mind of the electorate, but Kenyans have made up there minds and can&rsquo;t wait to vote jubilee out of power.&rdquo;He said there is no way Jubilee can be more popular in Western than NASA. That is &ldquo;total rubbish and lies,&rdquo; Wetang&rsquo;ula said. He said Kenyans are weary of debts, the high cost of living, rampant corruption and theft of taxpayer money by the national government and by the counties. Wetang&rsquo;ula said NASA will address all these issues. Wetang&rsquo;ula was accompanied by Kwanza MP Ferdinand Wanyonyi, Eseli Simiyu (Tongaren), Wafula Wamunyinyi (Kanduyi) and James Lusweti (Kabuchai).
