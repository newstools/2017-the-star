Credible nominations and the spirit of &ldquo;standing together&rdquo; will guarantee NASA&rsquo;s victory in August, analysts say.Both NASA and Jubilee are faced with the headache of conducting hotly contested primaries in April.Politicians who fear being locked out of primaries are defecting from one party to the other within NASA and from the Jubilee Party to friendly outfits assuring them a place on the ballot.Political scientist Prof Frank Matanga of Masinde Muliro University yesterday said, &ldquo;The best way for NASA is to hold joint nominations and only front a single candidate against Jubilee on every seat to avoid splitting opposition support.&rdquo; He said the primaries would be dangerous for NASA without a clear binding agreement on the conduct of the losers.Parties had until yesterday to submit nominations rules to the IEBC. Parties must submit membership lists from March 9-19. They have until April to submit the names of candidates for their primaries.Political commentator Martin Andati said the insistence by individual NASA affiliates on separate primaries shows lack of proper party structures and mistrust.&ldquo;I am seeing a repeat of 2013 when primary losers defected and ran on different tickets or supported the opponent,&rdquo; he said.
