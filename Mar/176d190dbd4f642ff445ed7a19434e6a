ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi yesterday told off President Uhuru Kenyatta for his statement that loans obtained by Jubilee are used to fund public infrastructure.He said said the loans are becoming a burden to the taxpayer.&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not opposed loans. But I&rsquo;ve said the scramble for commercial instead of concessionary loans is ruinous to the country&rsquo;s economic well-being,&rdquo; Mudavadi said, adding that commercial loans attract higher interest rates and shorter repayments periods than concessionary ones. &ldquo;I spent my tenure as Finance minister in the early 1990s cleaning up the mess caused by similar unregulated loans.&rdquo;He said Kenya&rsquo;s high debt levels are a result of gobbling up loans, which are punitive to taxpayers in the long run.&ldquo;I also know that these loans are expensive because of the high markup that unscrupulous contractors exert on project costs,&rdquo; Mudavadi said.He said the Jubilee regime prefer glamorous projects that result in punitive taxation and high cost of living and make room for corruption.
