A police officer attached to the Dog Unit at Mombasa's Kisauni area swallowed Sh2,000 on Friday after he was nabbed by EACC officers.Kepha Momanyi is said to have demanded Sh3,000 from a Tuk Tuk rider at Kongowea after which the anti-graft officers were alerted.The officer had ordered the vehicle towed to the police station unless he is given the cash.It was at this point that the rider called the Tuk Tuk's owner who informed the officers.Momanyi, according to an EACC detective who asked not to be named, was arrested at the Dog Unit's canteen."Upon being taken to the OCPD's office, he removed his pistol and threatened to shoot us," the detective said."He swallowed the money and in the confusion, managed to escape and is still on the run," the official said.Mombasa EACC boss George Ojowi told the Star on Phone that the officer "can run but he will not hide forever"."We will get him even if it takes one year," Ojowi said.Kisauni Police boss Christopher Rotich said he is waiting for communication from the EACC detectives over the matter.Also read: You can run but will not hide forever, EACC tells Homa Bay clerk
