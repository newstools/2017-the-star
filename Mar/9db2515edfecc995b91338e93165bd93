Kenya's average cotton production per hectare is lower than the world's average due to higher cost of input and little mechanisation, the Ministry of Agriculture said yesterday. Cotton farming is mainly practised by smallholder farmers. The country's average yield per hectare is 572 kilos against the world's average of 726 kilos, Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Willy Bett said in a speech read by the ministry's director of crop management Johnson Irungu.There is about 384,500 hectares of irrigated and rain-fed land for cotton farming, with only 10.4 per cent under irrigation, he said. The ministry has, however, put in place mechanisms to increase the yield of the cash crop. They include giving farmers subsidised seeds, training and partnering with local and international players to lobby for better business environment.&ldquo;We have partnered with other players and currently we are employing and implementing solutions that will allow us to revive the sector,&rdquo; Bett said.He said the ministry will introduce new irrigation methods to enable it cultivate 100,000 hectares by 2021.Bett spoke during the Africa Cotton Association 15th annual conference in Nairobi which brought together players in the cotton sector.The CS further said the ministry has certified three new varieties of seeds, which are resistant to pests such as termites. He said the government will enhance relationships with researchers to advise on the seeds that will produce quality cotton.
