Sanlam Kenya, formerly Pan Africa Holdings, yesterday reported a 158.21 per cent growth in net profit for the full-year ended December 2016, reversing three years of nose-diving earnings. The non-bank financial services group said net income climbed to Sh70.62 million from Sh27.35 million a year earlier on improved general insurance business performance.It joins a handful of Nairobi Securities Exchanges listed firms which have thus far posted growth in half- or full-year trading period that fell in the second half of 2016 when the firms experienced a tough investment environment. Sanlam said profitability was largely driven by the general insurance business where gross written premium grew by 58 per cent to Sh1 billion from Sh633 million achieved in 2015. However, gross written premium in life insurance business declined by five per cent to Sh4.4 billion from Sh4.6 billion achieved in 2015. Audited financial statements indicate policyholder benefits and claims in general insurance decreased by 75 per cent from Sh538 million to Sh135 million, which the firm attributed to the strategic decision to discontinue underwriting of the PSV line of business and improved non-motor to motor business mix. &ldquo;The post-acquisition business transformation programme for the general insurance unit has started to bear fruit with significant improvement attained in our engagement with customers and business partners,&rdquo; chief executive Mugo Kibati said. Sanlam, a South African financial services company, acquired its underwriting business from Pan Africa Insurance Holding.
