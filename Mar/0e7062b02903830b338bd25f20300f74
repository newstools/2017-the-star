Consultants at audit and business advisory firm PKF see the National Treasury focusing more on indirect taxes to raise the projected Sh1.74 trillion revenue for the financial year 2017-18.PKF tax experts said Treasury CS Henry Rotich is likely to dwell more on Excise and Value Added Tax in spelling out new measures to increase tax collections when he presents the Budget Statement to Parliament on Thursday next week. The new measures are also likely to ensure more businesses and individuals in informal sector are roped into tax bracket.&ldquo;In terms of looking at the different taxes, a lot of emphasis should be more targeted on indirect taxes because consumption is a must regardless of wealth or the status as opposed to focusing on direct taxes,&rdquo; PKF Kenya senior tax manager James Mulili said yesterday.With the country&rsquo;s tax compliance rate ranging between 40 and 45 per cent, Mulili said the Kenya Revenue Authority should streamline its administration processes and establish clear guidelines for filing returns to increase collections.&ldquo;It is only three weeks ago that we had visibility on the guidelines with regards to the amnesty on foreign earned income introduced under the Finance Act 2016, for example. Honestly speaking, those guidelines are not practical,&rdquo; said Mulili. &ldquo;The amnesty provision is one area that has not been fully capitalized on by the government.&rdquo;The 2017 budget policy statement shows that government expenditure during the 2017-18 fiscal year will amount to Sh2.29 trillion.PKF projects that 67.7 per cent of the budget will likely be allocated to recurrent expenditure, while 32.2 per cent will go to development expenditure.Some of the other changes the firm feels should be tackled in the 2017/18 include, betting and gaming as well as digital economy to be captured in the income tax act, interest on late refunds by KRA, review of capital gains tax, industrial building allowance and increased incentives in the manufacturing sector.
