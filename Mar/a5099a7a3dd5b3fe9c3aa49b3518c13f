IS Nairobi Deputy Governor Jonathan Mueke's political career headed for rocky ground? There is talk among Wiper leaders in Nairobi that the young ambitious county boss needs to be stopped before he becomes too big. And the way to stop him in his tracks is by replacing him with lawyer Kethi Kilonzo as Governor Evans Kidero's running mate at the August 8 general election. The party officials have been holding secret night meetings to discuss the issue, which their party leader Kalonzo Musyoka may not even be aware of. Question is: Will the officials succeed in their plan? ===HAS one of the Jubilee governor aspirants for Nairobi agreed to be paid off to drop out of the race? Our moles are now suggesting that the man may have been given a huge sum of money to step down in favour of one of the other candidates. However, the man has yet to receive the money and the one offering the cash may be reconsidering the deal for fear that the recipient may change his mind and use the cash to continue with his campaign.===A parliamentary committee that had a retreat in Mombasa recently is reeling with shock, wondering why a Principal Secretary from one of the Mt Kenya region counties showed up at the hotel. Those in the know say the powerful PS wanted to accompany the committee so that he could be close to his girlfriend, an MP and member of the committee. It&rsquo;s said the PS, a gubernatorial candidate who is also an MP and several other politicians contributed cash towards the launch of the female MP's reelection bid.===IT seems that when ODM leader Raila Odinga is out of the country, the opposition "calms down". During his trip to South Africa, US and Europe, the opposition has remained low key. Only the drama between Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho and President Uhuru Kenyatta has hit the headlines. Question is, who and what constitutes a vibrant and serious opposition?
