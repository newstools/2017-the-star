Low-income earners could get affordable housing if MPs adopt a new Bill compelling the government to develop laws that encourage investors to build cheap houses.The Bill, tabled last week by Budalang&rsquo;i MP Ababu Namwamba, demands the Housing CS ensure incentives and tax waivers are given to housing and construction players.Namwamba, who seeks to amend the Housing Act, proposes that a corporation in the construction industry be empowered to operate housing finance institutions to get funding from various donors, including the state, towards realising the setting up of low-cost houses.The proposed housing programme would benefit thousands of slum-dwellers in Nairobi, Kisumu and Mombasa.Reports indicate that about 70 per cent of Nairobians live in informal settlements.
