Kabete MP Ferdinand Waititu s new name is Ferdinand Ndung u Waititu Babayao.A gazette notice, number 2325, shows the legislator consented to the change through a deed poll drafted by his lawyer.A deed poll is a legal document binding only to a single person or several persons acting jointly to express an active intention. Notice is given that by a poll dated January 13, 2017, duly executed and registered in the Registry of Documents at Nairobi by our client Ferdinand Ndung u Waititu Babayao, formerly known as Ferdinand Ndung u Waititu, formerly renounced and absolutely abandoned the use of his former name Ferdinand Ndung u Waititu, the notice reads in part. Instead, he has adopted Ferdinand Ndung u Waititu Babayao for all purposes and authorises and requests all persons at all times to designate and address him by his assumed name Ferdinand Ndung u Waititu Babayao only. Babayao is in the race for Kiambu governor, seeking to wrest the seat from incumbent William Kabogo. His identity was at the centre of a suit filed against him by Kabogo, who questioned his university education. Judge Joseph Onguto dismissed Kabogo s application.
