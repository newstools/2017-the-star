Prominent city lawyer Apollo Mboya (pictured) might be charged with assault and creating a disturbance after allegedly forcing his way into the Kibera court and causing a woman guard to injure herself. Mboya was told to park his car outside the compound and as the guard closed the gate, he allegedly drove through. &ldquo;The lawyer forced his way into the compound after I explained there was no more parking inside. As I closed the gate, he drove in at a high speed and I jumped out of his way and hurt myself in the leg,&rdquo; she said. The guard reported the matter at the Kilimani police station. Mboya denied the allegation. He said he was denied parking and told it was for police and the prosecution. Mboya said, &ldquo;I followed a prosecutor in and they tried to lock the gate but I had already passed.&rdquo;
