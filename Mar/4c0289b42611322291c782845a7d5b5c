Business owners at Musaiga Place, near Nakumatt Prestige in Kilimani, are counting huge losses after fire gutted their premises yesterday. The mid-day inferno razed a saloon, barbershop, bar and restaurant. No death or injuries occurred. The fire was put out after 2pm by county firefighters. “The fire started a few minutes past noon and I think because of the hot weather, it spread very fast,” a police officer said. “But a fire brigade crew from the county contained it.” Witnesses said the fire originated from Musaiga Restaurant and might have been caused by an electric fault. “It was huge. There were gas cylinders in that restaurant so it exploded like a bomb,” one witness said. Mane Mwangi, the owner of the building, said police are investigating to establish the cause. “We just called that there was fire, but we still don’t know the cause,” he said. Capricorn Salon and Barbershop proprietor Carolyne Kabua said she lost Sh4 million property.
