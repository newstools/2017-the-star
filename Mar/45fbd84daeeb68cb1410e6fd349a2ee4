Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo (pictured) and politician William Oduol have broken ranks, less than three months after they teamed up to remove Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga. In December last year, Midiwo brought together Oduol and Rarieda MP Nicholas Gumbo, both of them seeking the Siaya governor seat. Oduol and Gumbo agreed to support whoever wins the ODM ticket.But on Friday Midiwo accused Oduol of betrayal and changing his tune. He criticised Oduol for announcing that he is a lone ranger in the race.Midiwo spoke in Ndere village. Oduol, however, dismissed Midiwo&rsquo;s remarks as propaganda meant to divert his supporters&rsquo; attention ahead of the ODM primaries. He admitted they were in talks with Gumbo through Midiwo until he realised the two only meant to enrich themselves and not Siaya residents. Oduol was speaking in Umina village, Ugunja constituency, on Saturday.
