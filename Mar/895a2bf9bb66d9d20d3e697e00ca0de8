Budalang&rsquo;i MP Ababu Namwamba has said his political opponents cannot match his two-term development record.In a statement on Saturday, he said he has transformed Budalang&rsquo;i and taken the constituency to greater heights. Five aspirants want to replace him.Namwamba said major reduction in flood risk is his outstanding achievement. &ldquo;When I took office, Budalang&rsquo;i was pretty much the other name for floods, but today, almost a decade down the line, it is transformed,&rdquo; he said.Namwamba said one-time floodplains are now lush rice fields providing a good foundation for food security and improved quality of life.Namwamba said a decade ago, the education sector was in bad shape, characterised by poor school infrastructure, low teacher morale, toxic politics defined by victimisation and community indifference.&ldquo;The area had only five secondary schools and not a single post-secondary institution. But today, Budalang&rsquo;i constituency boasts of a university campus in Mundere, Bunyala Technical Training Institute at Budebu, a revitalised Busagwa Youth polytechnic, the new Bukoma Polytechnic and Sango Teachers Training College in Lugale, Busia county&rsquo;s first public TTC,&rdquo; he said.
