The four NASA co-principals should speed up naming the coalition flag bearer, Butere MP Andrew Toboso has said.He said Raila Odinga, Musalia Mudavadi, Kalonzo Musyoka and Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula are wasting time.Kenyans are eager to know who will contest against President Uhuru Kenyatta in the August polls, the MP said.Toboso spoke when he distributed bursary cheques to secondary and university students at Butere Girls High School on Tuesday.The MP said the time for campaigns is running out as candidates for governor, senator, MP and MCAs need to be focused on which NASA candidate they should be campaigning for.&ldquo;We must avoid confusion in campaigns early enough by identifying our flag bearer,&rdquo; said Toboso, who doubles as the Kakamega ODM secretary general.He said the party is ready for its primaries seeing as the elections board has already developed mechanisms.Toboso said many candidates have paid nomination fees and assured those who will have qualified that the exercise will be free and fair.He said those who may be disqualified should not give up and lose confidence in the party.Toboso said vetting in the party is meant to identify strong candidates who will win.&ldquo;At least in every constituency, we have more than three candidates who have paid nomination fees and we need to get strong people who can defeat the Jubilee favourites in their respective seats,&rdquo; he said.
