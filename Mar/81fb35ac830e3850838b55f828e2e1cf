A video doing the rounds shows him shooting at his son. He denied the charge.Kibor, 86, said he wants to enjoy his hard-earned wealth until his death.&ldquo;I worked hard to buy all this land. It still belongs to me and my children have no right to fight for it or disturb me, claiming they want a share of it,&rdquo; he said.I&rsquo;ll share it on my own terms&ldquo;At the moment, all the wealth, especially land, belongs to me and they should wait [until] I die so that they fight for it, [but] not when I am alive.&rdquo;Kibor said he will write a will to share out his assets, but some of his sons are already opposed to it.&ldquo;Those who think I&rsquo;m so old are wrong because I know what I&rsquo;m doing,&rdquo; he said.Kibor is locked in a court battle with four of his sons over ownership of 1,250 acres of land at Kabenes.He owns more than 3,000 acres of land in Uasin Gishu and Trans Nzoia counties and has prime plots and buildings in Eldoret town. He also owns plots in Nairobi. He married four wives, one of whom is dead, and each of them was allocated 800 acres.The businessman moved to court last year to bar the transfer of the 1,250 acres to his sons, 20 years after subdivision of the same parcel.The hearing of the land dispute continued on Wednesday at the High Court in Eldoret.Illegally subdivided my landKibor has accused 20 parties, including his six sons, of fraudulently subdividing and processing title deeds for his 1,547 acres.&ldquo;I am still the owner of the entire parcel,&rdquo; he argues in the case.He says his sons illegally and fraudulently acquired his land and unprocedurally consolidated the two parcels before subdividing them and obtaining invalid title deeds.Kibor also accuses the defendants of continued trespassing, encroaching on and developing the land, and neglecting an order from the District Land Registrar requiring them to vacate and to surrender the invalid title deeds.Kibor has also filed a divorce case against his second wife Josephine to whom he has been married for 52 years. He accuses his wife of cruelty, adultery and interfering with his 800 acres farm at Kipkabus, which he wanted to sell.
