The National Land Commission will issue a special title deed for all water catchment areas in Lamu county to protect them from grabbers.Commissioner Silas Kinoti said grabbing water catchment areas in Lamu has become rampant and the only way to guarantee their safety is to have them gazetted.He spoke in Lamu on Saturday.Kinoti said the NLC, together with the Water Resources Management Authority and the county government, have identified seven water catchment zones. Efforts are being made to rescue them through conservation, he said.The catchment areas are in Shella mountains, Kiongwe, Mbelembele, Chomo, Lake Kenyatta, Amu ranch and Kibokoni ranch.Kinoti said the commission has directed Warma to work with the county government in identifying more catchment areas to be conserved before the NLC starts their gazettement and issuance of title deeds.
