Aspirants seeking the Kisii governor's seat are using the incumbent's unfulfilled pledges and stalled projects to campaign against him.The stalled projects include avocado and sugar factories.The department of agriculture supplied farmers with avocado seed. The crop is almost ready for harvest but farmers have nowhere to take their harvest.Ongwae commissioned the avocado plant in 2014. It was meant to process juices, pulp, soap and oil for export to Europe, Asia and Arab countries.Investor Levert Alkan from Australia pledged to invest Sh700 million in the plant, but he is still waiting for it to be completed.Agriculture executive Vincent Sagwe on Monday told the Star they will terminate the tender since the contractor has taken too long. The county government has set aside Sh3 million in next year s budget to enable a new contractor complete the project, which will be leased to the investor to start production, he said.He said the cost of the plant increased from Sh9 million to Sh12 million due to variation.
