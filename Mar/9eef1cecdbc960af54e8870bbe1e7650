It's a beehive of activities at the Garissa livestock market, but business is not booming for the livestock buyers and sellers due to the ravaging drought. Garissa is one of the 23 counties that has been severely affected by drought, according to the National Drought Management Authority. Abshir Mohammed Abdi, a trader at the Garissa market, said there are a few buyers and the prices have declined drastically. He said a three-year-old heifer that costs Sh20,000 is now being bought at Sh10,000, while a three-year-old camel that costs between Sh40,000-Sh30,000 is now going for as low as Sh13,000. “Last week, a camel was bought at Sh13,000 which was very disappointing,” says Mohammed. Livestock PS Andrew Tuimur yesterday said the government has disbursed Sh220 million for the livestock off-take. “We are buying a cow at Sh18,000 and sheep or goat is being bought at Sh5,000 to Sh3,000 in the entire pastoral drought affected counties,” he said. He said that to help farmers offload the affected livestock, the ministry has procured 6,004 heads of cattle, the Kenya Meat Commission was issued with Sh170 million and has bought 4,500 heads, while ADC bought 1,504 heads and was issued with Sh50 million. Ogle Gure, the cess collector at the market, said on a good day, he collects cess of Sh400,000 to Sh500,000 from the livestock business. “Today few livestock have been brought to the market due to drought and I have only collected Sh150,000 to Sh100,000,” he says. Each seller pays Sh80 per cow while buyers pay Sh210 per cow and the livestock market takes place every Wednesday. Gure says pastoralists come from as far as Somalia, Mandera, Wajir, Liboi, Masalani and Fafi, and once they are bought, they are taken to Nairobi, Thika and Mombasa counties.
