The Westminster ISIS-inspired fanatic has been unmasked as violent extremist Khalid Masood who was nicknamed 'the vampire' because he stalked the streets at night wearing all black.Masood, 52, was born Adrian Elms in Kent and has an appalling history of violent crime including stabbing someone in the face before converting to Islam in jail and moving to Saudi Arabia.He unleashed his murderous rampage after turning his back on his family in the Home Counties and living under five different names including Adrian Ajao and Khalid Choudry among others.After amassing a lengthy list of criminal convictions, the father of three changed his name to Masood and spent years living in a series of terrorist hotbeds across Britain.At one stage he was investigated by MI5, but was considered a "peripheral" figure and "not part of the current intelligence picture". And he did not feature on a secret blacklist of up to 3,000 people thought to be capable of mounting an attack. Scotland Yard today launched an urgent appeal to ask the public for help to find any accomplices as they try to piece together his path to terrorism.But his neighbours in Birmingham believe it is unlikely he was working alone and described him as a "strange character" and called him "the vampire" because he would only come out at night wearing only black clothes.He was born in Dartford, Kent, on Christmas Day in 1964, to 17-year-old single mother, Janet Elms, who is estranged from her son.She sells hand-made bags and cushions from her rural west Wales farm which was raided last night. His brothers have denied knowing him.Read: Lone London terror attacker was on WhatsApp two minutes before unleashing carnageMailOnline revealed last night that Masood stabbed a man in the face in 2003 following a street row outside and a nursing home and was sent to prison where he turned to Islam and met Masood, then 39, who was running a television aerial installation business at the time, also faced two charges of possessing an offensive weapon, namely a knife and a baton.His victim required plastic surgery on his nose and Masood, then under his birth name Elms, is believed to have been sent to prison where he may have converted to Islam. He had already spent time in Lewes jail, East Sussex, Wayland jail in Norfolk, and Ford open prison in West Sussex.After his release from 2004 he married Muslim Farzana Malik after converting to Islam.But even after finding religion MailOnline can reveal that his brushed with the law continued.In 2006 he jumped out of the third floor of his home in Crawley to avoid arrest as police chased him with former neighbours describing him as violent, abusive and generally 'bad news'.But despite his string of convictions for violent crimes, starting in 1983, he still appears to have secured work as an English teacher in Saudi Arabia and later Britain claiming he had a degree in economics.More on Daily Mail
