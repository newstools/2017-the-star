Mediators in the doctors' strike now want spiritual intervention to address three issues that they say are key to ending the stalemate that has lasted about three months now.The Law Society of Kenya asked that they be allowed to bring in Cardinal John Njue and Anglican Archbishop Jackson ole Sapit.Lawyer James Orengo said they reached an agreement on Wednesday but noted that the issues needed the attention of religious leaders."Give the religious leaders a chance and see whether they can help with the sticky issues," said Orengo.He was among the lawyers who Opposition leader Raila Odinga asked to appeal the one-month jail sentence doctors' union officials were to serve for contempt of court. The appeal lead to the release of seven officials from jail, a day after their sentence began.The lawyer who is Siaya Senator added: "We don't want good work done by any institution tarnished. Even the trial court has done its best and that is part of the record."More on this: Appeals court frees doctors' union officials, talks to resumeAlso read: Raila happy with Court of Appeal ruling, says Jubilee humiliating doctorsThe mediators did not narrow down to the three issues but among those they raised were four concerning the talks.These were whether they have decision-making powers, the introduction of neutral persons to make the decisions, the roles of other relevant parties and the matter of engaging the media.They also identified critical issues for the Health ministry, Council of Governors and the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Union.CoG lawyer Eunice Lumalias told the court that parties had failed to agree on key issues since the mediation began."We have no objection to a new party in the mediation process but that will have to be a fresh party. It is in everyone's best interests that this matter is resolved," she said.Judge Martha Koome granted the mediator's request saying "these are extraordinary circumstances that require divine intervention".Koome gave the doctors two days to involve religious leaders in their efforts to end the strike and said they should return to court with a solution on March 7."We are hopeful that [the stalemate] will be solved. The report they will present will be treated as an interim report," she said.But Treasury CS Henry Rotich claimed doctors were stalling because they were receiving orders from individuals he did not identify.But KMPDU secretary general Ouma Oluga and other union officials were chased from Treasury on January 6 after reporting that the National Governing Council had rejected the government's latest offer to end their strike. The meeting lasted 10 minutes.Read: Doctors' union officials receiving orders from 'certain quarters' says CS RotichDoctors downed their tools on December 5 last year saying theirs would be the longest strike in Kenya's history. The union, which has about 5,000 members, wants the government to give doctors a 150 to 180 per cent rise in basic salaries, review working conditions, job structures and criteria for promotions and address under-staffing in state hospitals.Their demands are in line with a Collective Bargaining Agreement signed with the government in 2013.Read: Inside the striking doctors&rsquo; 2013 collective bargaining agreement
