Senior Counsel Paul Muite has opposed a decision by the High Court barring him from representing former Mungiki leader Maina Njenga in a robbery with violence case.Muite said Justice Ngenye Macharia erred when she upheld the decision of a lower court that blocked him from defending Maina and appearing as a witness in the case.&ldquo;It is expected that judges will make mistakes from time to time. That is why there are appeal courts,&rdquo; he said.Muite said Njenga is being denied his constitutional right to be represented by a lawyer of his own choice.However, he indicated it&rsquo;s up to Njenga to decide whether to appeal the ruling and have the case heard by the Supreme Court as there is a fundamental principle of law that needs to be addressed.Macharia delivered the ruling on Thursday last week and barred Director of Public Prosecutions Keriako Tobiko from calling Muite as a witness in the case.She said there will be a conflict of interest if Muite is either allowed to defend Maina or appear as a witness.Njenga has, however, insisted that under the law he is entitled to be defended by a lawyer of his choice. He filed the application at the High Court after trial magistrate Dolphin Okundi disqualified Muite from representing him on grounds that Muite was a state witness in the case.In the lawsuit, Njenga, Francis Mwangi, Daniel Wanjohi, Ngare Njogu and Stephen Kuria have been charged with robbing police officers and a businessman of cash, guns and bullets inside the Hope Church on Thome Estate, Nairobi, on April 22, 2013.Macharia declined to declare Njenga&rsquo;s trial null and void and directed it be heard on a day-to-day basis until its conclusion. The Laikipia Senate aspirant had asked the court to terminate his trial, saying it will take too long to be concluded.
