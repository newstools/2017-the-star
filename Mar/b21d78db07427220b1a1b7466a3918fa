We sat in an open verandah, looking out over magnificent scenery of the Silole Sanctuary. It was hard to believe we'd arrived less than an hour ago, after literally &ldquo;escaping&rdquo; from the city. As we arrived, we saw two herds of eland with impala, plus the many birdsongs were very therapeutic medicine for our weary souls. We were so close to Nairobi, and yet it seemed so far away, as we sat in this timeless, wonderful place. Positioned on the edge of the Nairobi National Park next to the Maasai Lodge, it is a great &ldquo;get away from it all&rdquo; place. Silole has a rustically wonderful little cottage with a wonderful view of the park, and the most wonderful verandah to sit and watch amazing sunrises and scenery, including a large variety of wildlife. We had an enjoyable evening in the form of a &ldquo;braai&rdquo; (barbeque) and listened to stories of leopard visits on the roof at night, and occasional lions seen from the lodgings. We awoke to a natural orchestra of bird calls. As I walked outside a tiny dik-dik antelope was near the cottage.The sanctuary is an important part of the &ldquo;buffer zone&rdquo; adjacent to the national park, supporting a diverse range of flora and fauna. Day visits into the park are easy to arrange as the Maasai gate is nearby.The two-bedroomed solar-powered Silole Cottage is well worth a visit at only Sh15,000 per night.
