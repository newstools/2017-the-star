Maendeleo Chap Chap leader Alfred Mutua has said the party will neither support Jubilee nor NASA at the August 8 election. He said on Saturday that MCC will field candidates for all posts but the presidency. ‘’Maendeleo Chap Chap is a development-oriented party that does not support Jubilee or NASA. It’s in the hearts of the people to bring about real change,’’ Mutua said. He spoke at the Mabanga Farmers’ Training Centre in Kanduyi, Bungoma, where he met party members and aspirants. Mutua urged residents to join MCC and back its candidates on Election Day. The Machakos governor said the party targets to improve the living standards of the common wananchi. ‘’We’ve for a long time suffered due to poor and corrupt leadership that has been so much rooted in our systems. It has made us lag behind.”
