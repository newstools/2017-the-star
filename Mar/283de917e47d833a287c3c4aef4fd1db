Kenya&rsquo;s network of 61 public libraries is set to assume an additional role as centres of technology innovation, a concept adopted from Silicon Valley in California.Culture CS Hassan Wario said there has been a massive growth of the world wide web, and mobile telephony greatly eroded Kenya National Library&rsquo;s traditional profile as a book lender. He said there is a need to adopt initiatives to make the state corporation relevant in the Information Age.Wario spoke in Kisumu town on Friday, when he launched a 150-page technology innovation guide.The guide was developed by USAID, the University of Nairobi, Maseno University, the Ministry of Industrialisation, Land O&rsquo; Lakes, and Kemri over five years.The Feed the Future Kenya Innovation Engine was allocated $17 million (Sh1.74 billion) from the United States Presidential Initiative.The manual has 670 innovation applications and has created nearly 3,000 jobs.
