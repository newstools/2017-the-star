Treasury CS Henry Rotich has allocated Sh2.55 billion to support leather, textile and food processing.In what is seen as a move to revive stalled industries, Rotich has allocated Sh800 million to the Leather Industrial Park Development in the 2017-18 financial year. The funds will go towards kick-starting infrastructure works at the proposed 500-acre Leather Industrial Park in Machakos, which has attracted three Indian investors interested in setting up tanning factories. The government invited bids for the project in November last year as it seeks to have the private sector inject Sh17 billion into the project. Industry, Trade and Co-operatives CS Adan Mohamed said on February 28 said that works at the park has commenced and the first tannery is expected to be operational &ldquo;in the next 18-24 months.&rdquo;&ldquo;The leather park will provide a one-stop shop for processing of leather and finished products. It will be open for domestic and foreign investors,&rdquo; Mohamed said. Textile development will also receive Sh800 million in Rotich&rsquo;s budget. This comes as the Industry and Trade ministry embarks on renewed efforts to enhance partnerships with local textile and apparel sector in a bid to improve quality of products. Mohamed last week said the recent waiver of duties and taxes on the apparel, clothing and garments will be captured in the country&rsquo;s Export Processing Zone entities.This will allow products be sold in the local market without VAT and duties.About Sh450 million and Sh250 million have been allocated to modernisation of the Rift Valley Textile and the New KCC, respectively.In March 2016, Rivatex East Africa received a Sh3 billion loan from the Indian government through the Exim Bank to purchase new machines. The government this month released Sh500 million to pay 130,000 milk farmers who were owed by the New KCC before the company collapsed in 1998.In his budget, Rotich has also set aside Sh250 million for &ldquo;Ease of Doing Business&rdquo; as part of his plan to &ldquo;promote the development of industries and extractive sectors of the economy.&rdquo;Kenya is ranked 92nd globally in the World Bank&rsquo;s latest Ease of Doing Business Index , largely helped by the implementation of regulatory reforms in resolving solvency, starting business, protecting minority investors and getting electricity, the World bank report states.
