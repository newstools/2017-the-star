A 99-year-old woman was subjected to a terrifying sex attack by a man who walked into her home because her door was unlocked.The grandmother was in bed at her home in Hampshire when sick Paul Mepham, 62, made his way in and forced himself upon her.A shocking court hearing at Portsmouth Crown Court heard Mepham kissed and groped the woman in an attack lasting half an hour.Mepham has now been jailed for three years after admitting sexual assault. He will serve half of his sentence behind bars.The victim's family now fear Mepham may have other victims who are too scared or unwell to go to the police.Judge Claudia Ackner said the ordeal must have felt like a "lifetime" for the victim."This would have been a terrifying ordeal for her and it's no wonder that at that point in time she thought she was going to be raped," she said.The victim is now too scared to return to her home, and told her family she is scared of sleeping as she just sees Mepham walking towards her.Prosecutor Matthew Lawson said Mepham, formerly of Waterlooville, Hampshire, left two cans of Guinness behind."She then heard the door shut and thought to herself 'thank God he's gone'," she added.Even Mepham's own barrister, Howard Barrington-Clark, branded the incident "inexplicable".Speaking after the case, Detective Constable Amanda Layton of Hampshire Constabulary said: "This was a disturbing, albeit rare case which involved an assault on an elderly and vulnerable woman."I hope that now Mepham has been jailed, the victim and her family have closure."
