I must report for training with my new team,&rdquo; said Owili, who led his old team, Diamond Valley in the rebounds and was also second in blocks.However, Uganda-based trio of Brian Namake, Frank Ogolla and Mike Makiadi are in town and are training together with the rest of the squad for the tournament that throws off on March 12-18 in Cairo. Seven men and four women&rsquo;s teams have confirmed participation.But while the men&rsquo;s side got a blow, the women team coach David Maina confirmed that two key players will be available from today. Purity Odhiambo and Vilma Owino will beef up the squad when they report to camp from Asia and Uganda respectively. Maina said Kenya Ports Authority&rsquo;s centre, Yvonne Akinyi is yet to be released but everything was being done to have her in Nairobi soonest.&ldquo;Once all the girls are in camp, we will then start serious training,&rdquo; he noted.TeamsWomen: Natalie Akinyi, Susan Manya, Georgio Odhiambo, Mollete Achieng , Mercy Wanyama, Grace Wanjiku, Selina Okumu, Felmas Adhiambo, Beryl Okoth, Catherine Akinyi, Rita Odhiambo, Samba Mjomba,Hilda IndasiMen: Griffin Ligare, Joseph Khaemba, James Mwangi, Brian Namake, Felix Odhiambo, Frank Matoti, Kevin Chogo, Victor Bosire, Evans Leting, Kevin Kigotho.
