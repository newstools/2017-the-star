Former NYS Deputy Director General Adan Harakhe yesterday told an anti-corruption court that he was hounded out of office after he fell out with his seniors.His woes at the NYS began after he raised concerns that his password for the Integrated Financial Management System (IFMIS) system had been hacked.The former NYS officer has already been charged with abuse of office over a Sh47 million tender.He, together with former Devolution ministry senior secretary Hassan Noor faces various counts of conspiracy to defraud public funds, abuse of office and failing to follow the right procedure in awarding the contracts to Bluestar Enterprises Ltd.But yesterday, he was called by the prosecution to give evidence against former Deputy Director General Claire Lwali who is separately charged with abuse of office.Lwali is accused of acquiring accommodation and conference facilities at Naro Moru River lodge at Sh 4,476,000 without the approval of the Ministerial Tender Committee.While giving evidence against her, Harakhe said proper procurement procedures were not followed.But he told trial magistrate Kennedy Bidali that the procurement process was not part of Lwali job hence she cannot be faulted.During cross examination by lawyer Dunstan Omari , he further said although nearly all senior officers from NYS attended the conference, he was not invited and only learnt about it after.&ldquo;After the conference, the Director General came and told me that they had discussed to remove me as an AIE holder (authority to incur expenditure)&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;One day, the transport officer was sent to come and collect my car so that the driver could not drop me to work the following day&rdquo;He also said his two secretaries were also transferred and lockers in his office changed.&ldquo;I was thrown out of office but I am not bitter. In life there is ups and down. The truth will come out one day. I fully defended the law but I got hounded out&rdquo;.
