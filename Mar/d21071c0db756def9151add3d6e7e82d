Parliament is fighting to have the government increase the annual Constituency Development Fund allocation from the current Sh25 billion to Sh35 billion.Parliamentary committee on CDF chairman Moses Lessonet has said the problems that resulted in the reduction of the allocation by Sh10 billion have been fixed. The reduction resulted from a court ruling by Justice Mumbi Ngugi after an NGO last year filed a suit seeking to have the kitty declared unconstitutional. The court ruled that we can only get a maximum of Sh25 billion, but we ve dealt with the issues that led to the reduction, which emanated from the Division of Revenue Bill, Lessonet said on Friday.He said the CDF kitty received Sh31 billion in 2014 and Sh33 billion in 2015, but the court ruling ensured every constituency got an equal allocation of Sh81,896,551 million, a reduction from the Sh120 million they were to get.MPs had passed an amendment to the CDF law that required the allocation to be shared equally among all constituencies. They removed a provision that required part of the money be shared according to the poverty index.Out of the Sh81.9 million, Lessonet said every constituency is required to set aside Sh4.9 million for emergency.He spoke when his committee conducted a tour to assess the impact of CDF on Maragua constituency residents. The Eldama Ravine MP said the tour will also be used to educate residents on the benefits of the kitty.He said a number of residents approach MPs for development projects that are within the purview of the county governments. They don t know that the roles of CDF were reduced to national government functions only, Lessonet said. We want to find how the kitty has changed the lives of people since it was launched in 2002, he said.
