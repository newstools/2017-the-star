CoG chairman Peter Munya yesterday said President Uhuru Kenyatta should blame Deputy President William Ruto if he loses this year&rsquo;s poll.He said Ruto attacks leaders as he tries to ensure he is on the ballot in 2022.Munya said Ruto&rsquo;s &ldquo;unnecessary fights&rdquo; taint Jubilee&rsquo;s image.He said Ruto should be checked so he does not compromise Uhuru&rsquo;s reelection bid.&ldquo;Number two has been engaging in all sorts of machinations to cut us to size, but I can tell you they will not work,&rdquo; Munya said.He said Ruto fights every ambitious politician because &ldquo;he wants an easy win.&rdquo;&ldquo;Some of us are unstoppable. In fact, I will vie in 2022 for the country&rsquo;s top seat on the PNU ticket,&rdquo; Munya said.He described PNU as a political Tsunami.&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t win elections by antagonising people. You win when you bring everyone on board so the country can move ahead together,&rdquo; Munya said.He said Jubilee is a sister party to PNU because the latter supports Uhuru&rsquo;s reelection.&ldquo;We have a few people who are creating rivalry. We will field candidates across the country,&rdquo; Munya said.He added, &ldquo;Even Duale (National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale) is having sleepless nights in Garissa. We have candidates in all places across the country.&rdquo;Munya said Ruto has failed JP. He said, &ldquo;Let the public judge him on how he runs the government.&rdquo;
