The Makonde community on Thursday celebrated being granted citizenship by the Kenyan government.President Uhuru Kenyatta issued the Makonde community with 1,176 IDs, 1,731 birth certificates and 1,496 citizenship documents in February.Daudi Tikinika thanked the government for helping them get ID cards and citizenship, saying at last they can walk freely like other Kenyans.&ldquo;My grandchildren were getting problems without IDs, but now I am happy they move around freely after getting IDs. The President did us a favour by listening to us when we went to State House,&rdquo; he said.Amina Kassim said, &ldquo;Now we will not hire people to help our children to get birth certificates. We have saving groups and other government benefits that we can get directly.&rdquo;She said the Makonde will choose leaders of their choice, which will remain their secrets as voters.Martin Mkogo said he had a hard time trying to secure a birth certificate because his parents were stateless.&ldquo;For us, getting jobs was a problem because we lacked documents, but now we are happy and live without fear,&rdquo; he said.Makonde chairman Thomas Nguli said they experienced lots of hardships.He praised the national government for recognising them. Nguli pardoned government officials who blocked them during their walk to State House in October last year, saying they were only doing their work.He said they are ready to assist other stateless people, including the Pemba and Rwandese, to get citizenship.&ldquo;Makonde will elect whoever they want from MCA to President without me directing them because they know who helped them,&rdquo; Nguli said.Muhuri official Hassan Abdile said the remaining stateless people should also be recognised.He said the Makonde should be given the 30 per cent tenders set aside for youths, women and people living with disability.Kwale county Public Administration chief officer Nurein Mwatsahau said the county will ensure Makonde students get secondary school sponsorship like other locals.Kenya Human Right executive director George Kegoro said the stateless issue is an Africa matter and not just Kenya.He urged Uhuru to take the lead in addressing the issue in the region.Coast region coordinator Nelson Marwa asked the Makonde to make use of the citizenship to develop the country.&ldquo;Take loans and start working. You can do business anywhere because you are now Kenyans. Those studying can do it anywhere. Apply for passports as well,&rdquo; he said.He urged the Kwale county assembly to nominate members of the community as a marginalised group.
