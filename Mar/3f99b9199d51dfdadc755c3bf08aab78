The Prisons Department yesterday asked MPs to compel the National Treasury to give it an adequate budget to clear its pending bills and run smoothly.Correctional Services PS Micah Powon told the Administration and National Security committee, &ldquo;There are accumulated pending bills in the recurrent budget, inadequate housing for prisons officers and increased congestion in penal institutions.&rdquo;The pending bills stand at Sh4.7 billion on food, rations and wood fuel.The department has a deficit of Sh11.2 billion for recurrent spending and Sh5.1 billion for development. It requested Sh38.5 billion but was given Sh22 billion.Powon told the committee that lack of funds has made them unable to lease vehicles or fuel the available ones, making it difficult to take suspects to court.The department wants to be given 751 vehicles under the current government motor vehicle leasing programme. Powon says it has yet to receive the 100 cars it was to get this financial year.
