Nairobi governor aspirant Peter Kenneth is not seeking consensus to be the Jubilee Party candidate, and is ready for nominations, he has said. He also said he will not stoop to exchanging insults with rivals and other politicians. "People are insulting me hoping that I will retaliate, but I am sorry to disappoint them as I was well-trained to know that people will tell the difference between myself and others by what we speak," Kenneth said. "I am only interested in discussing issues and agendas and not discussing who looks whatever way and we have no apologies to make to anyone." Kenneth will start grassroot campaigns on Monday. "We are asking the party to start preparing to have every Jubilee aspirant in the nomination because we cannot sit and be insulted by people who have no idea what they even stand for," he said on Wednesday. Kenneth spoke at a meeting with more than 500 aspirants. He was with Linnet Mirehane, who is said to be his running mate. "As we start this journey we will sit together, all aspirants and incumbents equally, so that we walk together and rescue Nairobi from the drains," Kenneth said. He said his first agenda if elected governor will be to decentralise all services from City Hall to the constituencies.
