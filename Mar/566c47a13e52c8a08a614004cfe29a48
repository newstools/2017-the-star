In early February, President Uhuru Kenyatta declared war on drug barons and peddlers. During his visit to the Coast, Uhuru said his government is going to eliminate drug barons who have wiped out segments of the Coast population.Their days are numbered, Uhuru warned during his stopover at GPO in Mombasa, adding authorities will not hunt "small fish".&ldquo;We shall not allow the lives of youth and those of their families to be destroyed by drug barons,&rdquo; he said, adding that and youth should look for jobs and shun the menace.Main story: No drugs no rehab: Agony of addicts in Mombasa prisonsAddict numbers About 100,000 youths in the Coast region are addicted to hard drugs, with Mombasa alone having at least 70,000 drug addicts.Uhuru said the county has been turned into a drug capital, so immediate action must be taken.However, this was not the first tough talk from the President. In 2015, he issued similar threats.Uhuru took it a notch higher by overseeing the destruction of MV Noor, which allegedly smuggled Sh1.3 billion heroin into the country, and MV Baby Iris (Sh22m heroin).However, a Mombasa court declared both destructions unconstitutional and that Uhuru and other security agents defied court orders, stating that the vessels should not be destroyed as they were meant for exhibits in cases where several people were charged with smuggling narcotic drugs.Deputy President William Ruto acknowledged that some security officers have been compromised by drug barons but said action will be taken against them.Ruto told the media in Mombasa that the laxity of officers in the area must end for the war to be won."The laxity must be dealt with firmly. Combined efforts by security personnel are ongoing. Our position on drugs has not changed. It has been clear and consistent," he said.Ruto said the war on drugs was not geared towards elections and it did not matter what it takes to win the fight.The DP said that money from drug dealing is used to fund terrorists.Akasha's extradition These tough talks came a few days after two sons of slain drug baron Ibrahim Akasha were extradited to the US alongside their two foreign associates.Ibrahim and Bhaktash Akasha, Indian Vijay Goswami and Pakistani Gulam Hussein are expected to be charged with drug-related crimes.The war on drug barons aims to eliminate drug abuse, which has caused tears and pains to not only the drug addicts but also their families.
