Kenya s Visiline Jepkesho and Eunice Chumba paced Bahrain s Olympic silver medallist Eunice Kirwa to victory during the Nagoya women s Marathon yesterday.This was Kirwa s third straight year, becoming the first three-time winner of the IAAF Gold Label Road Race.Jepkesho and Chumba were under instructions to reach the half-way mark in about 1:11 while the third pace maker s target was 1:12. Kirwa, who fell at the start of the race, won in 2:21:17 to break her own 2:22:08 course record from 2015. Her time is also a personal best and a Bahraini record. I am very happy to win three in a row, despite falling at the start, said Kirwa. I was bit worried immediately after the fall. The pace makers did a good job of keeping up the pace and it was good that the pace did not slacken after they are gone. Yuka Ando, a marathon debutante who was 10th at the IAAF World Half Marathon Championships Cardiff 2016, finished second in 2:21:36, the fastest marathon debut by a Japanese runner and good enough for fourth on the Japanese all-time list behind Mizuki Noguchi, Yoko Shibui and Naoko Takahashi.As her time was faster than the 2:22:30 target set by the Japanese federation, Ando clinched a spot on the team for the IAAF World Championships London 2017. Since it was my first marathon, I was planning to run an aggressive race, said Ando. In order to challenge the Olympic silver medallist, I knew I need to stay with her. I told myself that if I can t stay with Kirwa, I can t be world class, but at the end I could not keep up with her. My weakness has shown at the end. Kirwa took a tumble just after the start, but apparently came out unscathed. The first kilometre was covered in 3:22 and by three kilometres, reached in 10:11, the lead pack was split into two groups with Kirwa, Ando, Kiyota and Ishii all in the first group.The first 5km was reached in 16:51 and when the ninth kilometre was covered in 3:08, Kiyota and Ishii started to drift behind Ando and Kirwa. After passing 10km in 33:14, Kiyota bridged the gap and caught up with the leaders, but after passing 15km in 50:05, Kiyota fell behind again. She caught up to Kirwa and Ando once more, but soon fell behind them for good.The leaders went through the half marathon point in 1:10:21, faster than scheduled time of 1:11, and both pace makers dropped out, leaving Kirwa and Ando to duel it out for the rest of the race. Naturally the pace slowed after the pace makers left the race. The 22nd kilometre took 3:30 and the 5km segment between 20 and 25 kilometres took 17:02, the slowest of the race.
