ODM has refilled the party vice chairman position following Eldas MP Adan Keynan&rsquo;s defection to the Jubilee Party on Monday.Keynan was welcomed to JP by President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto.A few weeks back, Keynan led a group of opposition leaders to Ruto&rsquo;s Karen residence, where they discussed their possible shift from the opposition.Sources within ODM told the Star the party has also decided to kick him out of the Public Investments Committee of the National Assembly.Keynan, who is PIC chairman, is to be replaced by Wajir woman representative Fatuma Ibrahim.&ldquo;We think Keynan has betrayed the party and therefore has no business remaining a member,&rdquo; said a source familiar with the issue. Keynan was one of the three Wajir ODM MPs who led the Degodia community to the Jubilee Party, saying they can longer continue being in the opposition.The other defectors are Abass Mohamed (Wajir East) and Mohamed Elmi (Tarbaj) Other defectors include 15 Wajir MCAs, led by speaker Bishar Omar.They said their decision to join the ruling party was informed by the development agenda being implemented by the government throughout the country. During the defection meeting at State House, Nairobi, Keynan said Wajir county resolved to join the Jubilee Party because &ldquo;it is the winning team.&rdquo;&ldquo;Your Excellency, you know us. We are always clear on our decisions. When we were joining the opposition, we declared it in daylight. That is the same thing we are doing here. What we are doing here is building an inclusive county,&rdquo; Keynan said.During the function, Uhuru said he has always been keen on working with Wajir residents for the sake of unity and stability of the region.&ldquo;I am happy about the decision you have made. This has been my prayer since 2013. It was our intention to work with you,&rdquo; he said.Uhuru added &ldquo;The most important thing in development is unity and stability. Where there is no unity and peace, there can be no development in the country.&rdquo;
