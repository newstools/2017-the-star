Retail store Uchumi Supermarkets is closing down on a strategic investors and partner who will inject Sh5 billion to the company in its turn-around strategy.Uchumi Chief Executive Officer Julius Kipng'etich yesterday said that the company has narrowed down to three investors from a list of 39, who had expressed interest in partnering with the organisation.The strategic partner is expected to inject funds for stocking the retailers stores countrywide."Plans to have an investor to partner with Uchumi are ongoing and by mid this year, the company will reveal the most suitable investor that we will work with to bring life back to the company," Kipng'etich said.The company management said part of its turnaround strategy also includes adoption of a franchising model, funding through a shareholder loan, ICT improvement and supplier support."Apart from the strategic investor we will be employing other tactics to make sure that the company manages to make a comeback to profit making," Kipng'etich said.The company has managed to reduce its losses by nearly half in the past six months. On February 28, the publicly listed firm reported a 46.22 per cent drop in half year net loss from Sh1.01 billion, to Sh547.31 million in the six months ended December 2016.This has renewed hope of returning the loss-making retailer to a break-even point after a series of losses and stand-off with its suppliers, who last year had refused to stock its shelves over delayed payments.The management attributed the good performance to strategies, such as closure of five non-profitable stores across the country among them the Uchumi Ngong-Road. In July last year, the company was allocated a Sh1.2 billion capital injection by the government through the National Treasury. It received the first tranche of Sh500 million in January 2017. Kipng'etich said the retailer expects the government to release the second tranche of the funds in April this year, which would be used to re-stock its stores."The money we will receive from the government will be used to increase the stock levels to help the company regain footfall and consequently increase revenues with the aim of returning to profitability," Kipng'etich said.The retailer plans to venture into franchising as it seeks to increase sales, as risks will be transferred to the management of new outlets.The model will be implemented by setting up smaller outlets (Uchumi Express and Uchumi Mini) through which Uchumi Supermarket will earn royalties of approximately four per cent of the sales.Kipng'etich said they will continue to pursue strategies aimed at stabilizing the retailer's performance including the sale of non-core assets, sourcing for a strategic investor, building supplier confidence and enriching customer experiences.
