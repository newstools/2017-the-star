Wildlife affected by the raging drought in the country will be translocated to other parks, the agency said on Wednesday. Paul Gathithu, Kenya Wildlife Service deputy director, said they are mapping areas where animals are perishing. He pointed out Lake Kenyatta in Lamu, Hindi Dam where more than 15 hippos have died as a result of water shortage. The agency is also studying Ijara area in Boni where five buffaloes perished as a result of the drought. "We are supplying water to the affected national parks. We will move some of the animals to reduce pressure on water and pasture," Gathithu said. He said that the wildlife agency is concerned about the wave of the invasion of private ranches and conservancies in Laikipia. On Sunday, the invaders shot dead Tristan Voorspuy, co-owner of the Sosian ranch. The Briton was killed while on an inspection of the property following an incident on Friday where three houses were torched.Read: KWS begins mission to rescue hippos stuck in drying Lamu water sources
