NGO Save the Children has partnered with the Mandera county Health department and other players to reduce maternal mortality.Speaking in Takaba town when he officially launched programme, Health executive Ahmed Mohamed said maternal mortality is still high in Mandera.The Sh2 million programme will run for 30 months in Mandera West, Mandera South and Banisa subcounties under Save the Children, while EPAG/HPA covers Mandera North, Lafey and Mandera East subcounties respectively.Mohamed said the county is building modern maternity wings for 24 new health facilities in all the six subcounties.According to statistics from the Health ministry, Mandera is the worst place for a mother to give birth and for a child to be born in and live in Kenya.Maternal mortality ratio is estimated at 3,795 deaths per 100,000 live births, against a national estimate of 362 deaths per 100,000 live births.&ldquo;We inherited poorly serviced facilities from the national government, coupled with the challenges of insecurity. We have, however, tried to do our best despite all these challenges and we are determined to improve our healthcare system,&rdquo; Mohamed said.The programme targets more than 260,000 mothers and 190,000 children below the age of five.At least 90 birth companions, formerly known as traditional birth attendants, and 90 religious leaders will be trained to spearhead campaigns to enncourage women to visit hospitals.Save the Children project officer Abdalla Sharif said the programme will contribute towards improving maternal and child health.
