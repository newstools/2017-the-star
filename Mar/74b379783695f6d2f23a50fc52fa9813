Days are gone when most weddings were held in the church where one worshiped. This was simply to give everyone who worshiped in the church a chance to attend whether invited or not. It was also a chance to help increase the church ratings but nowadays things have changed. People prefer garden or beach weddings and can invite fewer guests, unlike the previous years where one would invite the whole village, constituency or even county to witness him say ‘Yes I do’ to his partner.
