As the August August 8 poll nears, a bruising battle for both the Nakuru governor and Senate race is shaping up, with aspirants leaving nothing to chance. Intense rivalry is already playing out in the one of the country&rsquo;s political hotbed as candidates eyeing the Jubilee Party ticket comb villages and trading centers soliciting for votes from over the 700,000 registered voters.With Jubilee enjoying huge following in the county, the party nominations slated for April 20 are expected to be intense, because the candidate who will clinch the ticket, for both the Senate and governor race, will have a higher chance on August 8.Governor Kinuthia Mbugua is facing stiff challenge for the Jubilee ticket from Nacada boss John Mututho and former National Transports and Safety Authority chairman Lee Kinyanjui.Mbugua, a former AP Commandant before he plunged into politics in 2012, has been on the receiving end over his development record, corruption allegations and nepotism in his administration.Former Nakuru Town MP Kinyajui is urging residents to vote out the incumbent, citing the poor state of infrastructure in most parts of the county, and drawing comparisons with neighbouring devolved units.Critics have, however, also accused Kinyanjui of running a lackluster campaign, which is unlikely to give Mbugua any sleepless nights. Kinyanjui ran against Mbugua in 2013, but lost in the TNA nominations.The former AP boss has wide networks in the county, having served as a district commissioner in the area during the Kanu era. Those are the networks he activated ahead of the 2013 general election to romp into victory.His administration has, however, been dogged by allegations of misappropriation of funds, irregular hiring and Mgugua's globetrotting and senior officers, under the guise of looking for investors.Mututho, a vocal crusader against alcohol and drug abuse, has promised to mount an aggressive campaign to unseat Mbugua and "save the county from mismanagement&rsquo;Both Mututho and Kinyanjui are also pegging their hopes of defeating Mbugua on unfulfilled campaign promises, exaggerated wage bill and underdevelopmentMututho is making a political comeback after he was beaten &mdash; by a huge margin &mdash; in the TNA nominations in 2013 by newcomer John Kihagi, ending his first term stint as Naivasha MP. Controversial nominated Senator Paul Njoroge who recently literally shot to fame, has announced he will stand for governor on the Kanu ticket.DEVELOPMENT RECORDThe governor aspirants have challenged Mbugua to list his development track record.&ldquo;There is nothing residents can pinpoint that stands out as being done by Mbugua. He does not have a clear development track record he can speak of since he was elected four years ago,&rdquo; Andrew Nyabuto, a Nakuru political analyst, said.Mbugua, who was overwhelmingly voted in 2013, has somewhat lost favour with the electorate largely because of unfulfilled promises.Njoroge says he wants to offer transparent leadership. He has anchored his campaigns on development, coexistence and tolerance.CHOICE OF RUNNING MATESBesides the party being a key factor in the governor race, the choice of running mate is also a determinant on who wins.The county hosts more than 10 tribes, with the Kikuyus and the Kalenjins being the majority.With all the leading candidates in Jubilee being from the Kikuyu community, it is expected that their running mates will be from the Kalenjin.&ldquo;Kalenjins will support a Kikuyu in the governor race, but to get this support, they will have to pick one of their own as his deputy,&rdquo; Nyabuto said.The National Super Alliance is expected to field a candidate, who can upset the delicate ethnic arithmetic.&ldquo;For NASA to make an impact in the governor race, they have to come up with a candidate who will appeal to their base and at the same time, eat into Jubilee support,&rdquo; Nakuru town-based political analyst said.Mbugua's reelection campaign has been also been saddled by some of his policies, which have alienated some groups such as hawkers, who form a critical and influential voting bloc.The governor fell out with the traders after he removed them from the streets two years ago, "to restore the town&rsquo;s lost glory".Though the clean-up exercise received support from most of the residents, the hawkers are still bitter with him, and have vowed to teach him a lesson come August.WOOING VOTERS In an attempt to reconnect with the voters, Mbugua lat year initiated the Gavana Mtaani programme, in which his entire administration would camp for two days in the 11 subcounties to listen to the public.The programme, however, attracted a lot of criticism from residents, who said Mbugua was misusing the taxpayer&rsquo;s money since the initiative was not approved by the assembly. But Mbugua in his defense maintained the programme was all about taking services closer to the people.&ldquo;This programme brings services to our residents at the subcounty level. No other county has such an initiative and this is because we care about our people,&rdquo;Mbugua told the press in a past media briefing.Mututho and Kinyanjui have increasingly been under pressure from their supporters to join hands to enhance their chances of beating Mbugua. The argument is that if Mbugua and Kinyanjui run, they will split the votes, handing Mbugua an easy and outright win at the nominations and on August 8.The incumbent has started a door-to-door campaign and is expected to run a well-oiled one as we approach the polls. He has a lot of resources at his disposal.SENATE RACEMore than six aspirants have expressed their interest in running for the Senate. The incumbent is James Mungai, who has maintained a low profile since he was elected in 2013.The six are veteran politician Koigi Wamwere, speaker Susan Kihika, Engineer Jack Waihenya, lawyer-cum-businessman Karanja Njoroge, businessman Andrew Yatich and Davynisius Matagaro. All are eyeing the Jubilee ticket.Waihenya, a cost engineer and businessman unsuccessfully run for Rongai MP in 2007 on the PNU ticket but lost to Raymond Moi of Kanu.

He has a bachelors degree in Building Economics from the University of Nairobi, a masters degree in project management and is currently doing his PhD at JKUAT.

He has based his campaign on restoring &lsquo;Nakuru Voice in Parliament&rsquo; message, by effectively oversighting the executive and exposing the rot in the county. Interestingly, Koigi defeated Kihika Kimani in the Nakuru North parliamentary 1979 and is now set to take on the latter's daughter for the Senate, 38 years later.Koigi has been using his radio station and his column in this paper to reach out to voters and sell his policies. He relies on his experience as a politician and has activated his political connections across the county.Kihika, nicknamed &lsquo;Nakuru&rsquo;s Iron Lady&rsquo; is relying on her performance as speaker and family ties that cut across the county.The US-educated attorney is running a well-oiled campaign and is enlisted the support of youths who have been active on social media marketing her bid.Kabage, a veteran lawyer, is not new to politics. He unsuccessfully run for Molo MP in 2007 . In 2013, he vied for Njoro MP and lost to John Kiuna. He is reaching out to sitting MPs and other aspiring candidates for various seats to support his Senate bid.
