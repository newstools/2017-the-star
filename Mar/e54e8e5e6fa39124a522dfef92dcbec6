The delay in naming a flagbearer could cost NASA votes, Makueni Senator Mutula Kilonzo Jr has warned.&ldquo;The undecided category of voters is very high, with only 130 days to election. It is my view that [the] majority of them support the opposition and delays in naming a presidential candidate can easily make them to be swayed,&rdquo; he said.All NASA principals &ndash; ODM party leader Raila Odinga, Wiper&rsquo;s Kalonzo Musyoka, Ford Kenya&rsquo;s Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula and ANC&rsquo;s Musalia Mudavadi &ndash; are eyeing the presidential ticket.Speaking to reporters at Wote yesterday, Kilonzo said there is need for the principals to move with speed and agree on one candidate to end speculation that they will separate before the August polls. &ldquo;The faster we get a flagbearer, the faster we will be able to manage the anxiety that has gripped our supporters and do our campaigns properly,&rdquo; he said.Kilonzo said the principals should go to a secluded place and make a decision.&ldquo;[The] time has come for the four principals to go far away, leave their phones and the people who follow them, if possible, and sit and agree on a candidate because time is up,&rdquo; he said.no reckless statementsHe warned the principals against being influenced by the 12-member technical committee tasked with advising on a formula for picking the flagbearer.Kilonzo said the committee is too large and it will be easier for the four principals to determine the flagbearer without much fuss.&ldquo;The committee should expedite the technical aspects of forming government and leave the decision to come up with a flagbearer to the four principals who have the key to it and who will make the ultimate sacrifice on the decision,&rdquo; he said. The senator cautioned members of the committee against making unnecessary press statements.&ldquo;I disagree with the technical committee members Francis Nyenze, Senator [James] Orengo and any other member issuing press statements on the issue,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;We will start thinking the committee is not working and the moment we discover that, I will be the first one to ask for its disbandment.&rdquo;A proper functioning team would not be exchanging statements in public, he said.He urged NASA supporters to be prepared to accept whoever will be chosen, adding that the alliance is the surest way of dislodging Jubilee from power.&ldquo;The four principals cannot be a President or Deputy [President] at [the same time] and if we have to beat Jubilee in [the] August polls, our supporters must remain intact,&rdquo; Kilonzo said.
