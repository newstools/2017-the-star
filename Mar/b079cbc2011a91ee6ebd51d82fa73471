Armed Pokot bandits launched a fresh attack in Baringo North subcounty yesterday, driving more than 300 animals away.This happened a few hours after Deputy President William Ruto declared Baringo North and Baringo South 'disturbed' zones' and ordered full-scale security operation to flush out the bandits.He also gave a shoot-to-kill order against the bandits, who have already killed 10 people, injured two and displaced more than 30,000.Kabosgei location chief Richard Chepcheng Kaplegit said the bandits raided Kipnai village near Kinyach in North Baringo and stole animals.Forty-four of the animals belong to Kenya Police Reservist Nelson Cherop and 40 to resident Lawrence Aengwo.Chepcheng said the bandits daringly fired in the air before fleeing with the animals towards Chebelion village in Tiaty subcounty."We followed the animals all the morning with help of police and KPRs, but our efforts were futile because the more than 100 bandits were heavily-armed," he said.Chemoe resident Richard Chepchomei told the Star in Kabarnet town the bandits burnt houses in Yatya and Kagir on Monday night, a few hours after Ruto's speech in Kipsaraman.Baringo county commissioner Peter Okwanyo condemned the raid.He was addressing a peace meeting at the Kenya School of Government. Kenya Red Cross Society secretary general Abbas Gullet and Baringo Governor Benjamin Cheboi attended.Okwanyo said the bandits are boys aged between six to 14 years who have dropped out of school."There are 5,000 to 6,000 illegal guns in the county, making it difficult for the government to deal with runaway insecurity," he said.County leaders apologised for the raid on Red Cross vehicles on the Kambi ya Samaki-Kapedo road.Gullet questioned why the attacks have been left to escalate, saying "uneducated children are recipe chaos".He said Red Cross does not demand an apology from anybody, but he wants communities to allow it to do its work in peace."Darfur in Southern Sudan is the worst IDP camp, but Red Cross is the only humanitarian organisation living there. Why attack it in Baringo? Gullet said.He urged Baringo residents to be peaceful and concentrate on development.On Monday, DP Ruto announced deployment of 381 first patch of security officers among them 230 Adminstration Police (AP), Rapid Deployment Unit (RDU) and 151 Kenya Police Reservists(KPR) to hit the ground on Tuesday.
