Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho yesterday suffered another blow after the High Court barred him from withdrawing or transferring money held in six bank accounts.Justice Hedwig Ong&rsquo;udi of the Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Division of the High Court said Joho should not touch close to Sh37 million held at Stanbic Bank until the KRA completes a tax returns assessment.Following the freeze orders, the money will be preserved for at least a month, pending the assessment of income for purposes of taxation or until further orders.The taxman filed an urgent application saying it was investigating Joho after realising he last filed returns in 2014.Justus Kiuvu, one of the officers investigating tax evasion, states in an affidavit that his last returns were for the years 2008 - 2013.Kiuvu further said Joho filed nil returns for all the years, except in 2010 when he returned Sh1,000 only.&ldquo;Despite declaring nil tax, he is the registered owner of two high-end motor vehicles - Rolls Royce KBR 001R and Porsche Cayenne KCG 001J,&rdquo; the investigator states in court documents.The officer said it was apparent the governor has been earning income for which no taxes have been charged, and it is for that reason KRA intends to tax him.
