Two MCAs have asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to give Kenya’s first Education minister Joseph Otiende a state burial. Central Maragoli MCA Abdallah Chogo and his Walugaga Muluma counterpart Wilberforce Kitiezo yesterday said Uhuru should attend the burial on Saturday or they will heckle anyone who will represent him. Chogo said, “The former minister and the founding father Mzee Jomo Kenyatta were good friends, so why should Uhuru skip his father’s friend’s burial?” “We will heckle and shout down anyone who will try to speak on behalf of the President,” the Central Maragoli MCA said. Chogo, whose middle name is Otiende, pointed at a huge tree and said, “That tree was planted by Uhuru’s father, which is a clear indication of how the two were close.” He said, “Mzee Jomo Kenyatta was heckled in 1969 while coming from Otiende’s home.” The President had toured Nyanza and Western to inspect development projects. Kitiezo said Uhuru has room to adjust his schedule to attend the burial. The two spoke at Kegoye Friends Church during a funeral service for Otiende. They asked Amani leader Musalia Mudavadi to attend the burial dressed in the tradional regalia that he was given by the elders when he was made the Luhya spokesman in December last year. Interior PS Karanja Kibicho on Tuesday paid the hospital Sh1.1 million bill. Vihiga county commissioner Pauline Dolla said the government paid an additional Sh350,000 for funeral expenses. The county boss said the government will offer any other support needed by the family in terms of logistics and security.
