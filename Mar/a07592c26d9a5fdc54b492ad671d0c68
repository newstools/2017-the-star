Kajiado governor aspirant Joseph Lenku has pledged to end clan animosity if elected.He accused Governor David Nkedianye of failing the youth. Nkedianye took office after he was elected in 2013 on the belief he had promised the youth he will stand by them and even empower them economically, Lenku said. Yet our youth have no say in this government of Nkedianye. I am promising my supporters that I will not follow that path of lies to gain leadership. He spoke on Saturday at the Maasai Technical Training Institute in Kajiado town. Lenku accused Nkedianye of funding politicians Tarayia Kores and George King ori to ruin his (Lenku s) bid.But Nkedianye s personal assistant Jackson Sinkeet said the former CS s remarks border on hate speech and he should be reported to the police.
