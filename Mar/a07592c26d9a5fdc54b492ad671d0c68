Kajiado governor aspirant Joseph Lenku has pledged to end clan animosity if elected.He accused Governor David Nkedianye of failing the youth.&ldquo;Nkedianye took office after he was elected in 2013 on the belief he had promised the youth he will stand by them and even empower them economically,&rdquo; Lenku said.&ldquo;Yet our youth have no say in this government of Nkedianye. I am promising my supporters that I will not follow that path of lies to gain leadership.&rdquo;He spoke on Saturday at the Maasai Technical Training Institute in Kajiado town. Lenku accused Nkedianye of funding politicians Tarayia Kores and George King&rsquo;ori to ruin his (Lenku&rsquo;s) bid.But Nkedianye&rsquo;s personal assistant Jackson Sinkeet said the former CS&rsquo;s remarks border on hate speech and he should be reported to the police.
