Jurgen Klopp is adamant that Liverpool must &lsquo;show a reaction&rsquo; to their dire 3-1 defeat by Leicester on Monday night when they host Arsenal at Anfield this weekend.The Reds have won just one of their previous seven league games, and have slipped 14 points behind league leaders Chelsea in the process.The recent slump leaves Klopp&rsquo;s side facing a fight to seal a top-four finish and the Champions League riches that accompany it.Klopp insists he remains positive as he targets Champions League qualification.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very, very positive about the whole thing, how much time I can get I have no idea. But I am in close talks with our ownership, and so we are all fine. Qualifying for the Champions League would be a big success, 100 per cent. Qualifying for the Europa League, I&rsquo;m not sure I could sell it as a success, but it would be OK, and a step in the right direction,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;But it is too early to say what would be a success, because we have to learn from the last games very, very quickly.&rdquo;The German admits his side have conceded too many goals, with defensive issues a recurring problem during his time in charge.The Reds have kept just three clean sheets in 2017, with first-choice defensive partnership Joel Matip and Dejan Lovren playing together only once so far this year.&ldquo;We had to change a lot, especially on the centre-half position. Do we concede too many goals? Yes, absolutely,&rdquo; Klopp admitted.And the Liverpool boss has his fingers crossed that his side can once again show their class against a top-four rival.&ldquo;First of all we have to make sure we are really good against Arsenal again, because if we want to stay in their reach in the table we need to bounce back. That&rsquo;s how it is. We have no alternative, we have to deliver and show a reaction.&rdquo;
