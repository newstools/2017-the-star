Kigumo MP Jamleck Kamau is likely to be elected Murang'a governor if polls were held in the county today, a survey released on Wednesday has revealed.The legislator, according to the poll conducted by the League of Kenya Women Voters, will be in a tight race with the incumbent Mwangi Wairia.In the survey conducted between February 21-28, 56% of the respondents said Jamleck is the best bet for the county.At least 43.7 per cent of the respondents, in a sample of 2,134 electorates with a margin of error of 0.01 drawn from the seven constituencies, said Wairia will retain his seat in the August 8 polls.The poll further revealed that Jamleck commands support in five constituencies namely Maragua (68.3%), Kigumo (59.1%), Mathioya (67.2%), Kiharu (52,3%), and Gatanga (58.6%). Wairia, on the other hand, enjoys massive support in Kandara (53.8%) and Kangema sub-county (58.3%).The survey also revealed that Senator Kembi Gitura might retain his seat, having earned the support of 47.3 per cent of those interviewed.Of those polled, 37.7% believe Kiharu MP Irungu Kangata is best placed as the county's next senator while Peter Njangi (an aspirant) was backed by 1.7 per cent.Muranga woman representative Sabina Chege was backed by 75.5% of the respondents who said she might win the vote by a margin of over 50 per cent.The county, according to IEBC, had 453,725 registered voters ahead of the March 4, 2013 voters. This is likely to go higher following the recent mass listing.The league of women voters, in its summary, expressed concerns over the situation of the low number of women coming out to seek elective positions.The non-partisan political women's membership organization urged more women to be involved in Murang'a county politics, especially in the governor race."As at the end of February 2017, a majority of the wards manifested male dominance in regard to those contesting for elective seats," the survey states. Only 2 of the 33 wards had at least one female aspirant already known to the electorate.At the constituency level, there were 6 female candidates for MP seats against 62 male candidates from the entire county.
