The DPP has said it will appeal the acquittal of political analyst Mutahi Ngunyi on hate speech and ethnic contempt charges. Senior assistant to the DPP Moses Omirera yesterday said his office is not satisfied with the High Court ruling which dropped the incitement to violence charges against Mutahi. He said the Office of the DPP is preparing appeal papers to be filed at the Court of Appeal soon. On February 27, Justice Joseph Onguto stopped the DPP from prosecuting Mutahi. He said the trial was an abuse of the criminal justice system, and prohibited further proceedings. Onguto said the NCIC was in a hurry to prosecute Ngunyi without giving the petitioner room to pursue the alternative window of conciliation, which is why the commission was formed. On August 19, 2015, Ngunyi described Luos as &ldquo;poverty-stricken&rdquo;.
