Mesut Ozil did not train on Wednesday, with Arsenal&rsquo;s star suffering from illness ahead of Saturday&rsquo;s showdown with Liverpool.The Gunners are preparing for the Premier League game and hoping their German playmaker will be passed fit to play.Ozil missed two games in January due to illness but Arsenal hope he will be back at London Colney before Saturday. The 28-year-old has made 29 appearances for Arsenal this season, scoring nine goals. Despite missing Ozil, Arsene Wenger&rsquo;s side were handed a triple injury boost as Aaron Ramsey, Laurent Koscielny and Olivier Giroud all took part in first-team training.France centre back Koscielny, 31, picked up a hamstring injury in Arsenal&rsquo;s disastrous 5-1 Champions League last-16 first-leg defeat by Bayern Munich last month.Manager Wenger was forced to withdraw his stand-in captain with the score at 1-1 and his team promptly capitulated in the second half.Koscielny missed last week&rsquo;s 2-0 FA Cup win at non-League Sutton United but now appears to be close to a first-team return.Meanwhile, Germany team manager Oliver Bierhoff believes Mesut Ozil was unfairly made a scapegoat by Arsenal after their 5-1 mauling in the Champions League by Bayern Munich.Arsenal&rsquo;s hopes of advancing in Europe&rsquo;s elite club competition are all but over the first-leg defeat. They started strongly and got an away goal through Alexis Sanchez but when Koscielny went off injured, Bayern took full advantage. And Ozil, as well as manager Arsene Wenger, took a lot of criticism for the result which Germany team manager Bierhoff insists is unfair. &ldquo;If I look at Ozil, who was singled out following the 5-1 loss to Bayern, in that match there was not much support for a player like Mesut, who lives on his footballing qualities,&rdquo; said Bierhoff. &ldquo;The team let him down a bit.&rdquo;Arsenal responded to the Bayern defeat by defeating Sutton 2-0 to reach the quarter-final of the FA Cup. They are next in action on Saturday when they head to Anfield to take on top-four rivals Liverpool at Anfield. Arsenal are a point above Jurgen Klopp&rsquo;s side with a total of 50 from 25 games.Their return leg against Bayern is on Tuesday.
