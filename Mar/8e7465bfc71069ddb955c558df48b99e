Trans Nzoia and Bungoma counties have become the bedrock of political activity, amid aspirants&rsquo; shifting alliances as they seek endorsements from their clans and communities.The Luhya and Sabaot councils&rsquo; of elders in Trans Nzoia signed a peace agreement in 2012, known as the Mabanga Accord, after a series of tribal clashes among the communities. Luhya Council of Elders&rsquo; chairman Peter Masinde on Tuesday in Kitale said there was negotiated democracy to guide major communities in the two counties in sharing out of political seats. The elders did not, however, agree on individuals, but on communities holding the positions. The communities were to identify one of their own to fill the positions agreed on.Masinde said based on this, the elders agreed to leave the position of governor in the two counties to Bukusu candidates. The reason was because the Bukusus dominate the region.The positions of deputy governor were to go to the Sabaot. For Trans Nzoia county, the Senate seat was left for the Sabaot community. The Sabaot were also to get representation in the National Assembly. It was agreed the Saboti and Mt Elgon MP positions be left to them. The Iteso were given senior positions in Bungoma.Masinde also denied remarks made on Monday by Trans Nzoia ODM secretary John Simiyu that the party had endorsed Governor Patrick Khaemba of Ford Kenya to run for a second term. Simiyu said they have picked Protus Chemonges for deputy governor and Kipruto arap Kirwa for senator. &ldquo;Kirwa is from the Nandi community. He cannot snatch the only seat we [Sabaot] have. Senator Henry Ndiema is the only person in a top seat representing the Sabaots,&rdquo; Masinde said.
