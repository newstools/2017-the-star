Defence lawyers spent Thursday afternoon poking holes into claims a mobile phone belonging to a policeman was used to plot the murder of human rights lawyer Willie Kimani and two others.The prosecution said the phone belonging to Richard Nyakundi, an officer attached to Mlolongo police station, was used to make at least 15 calls at Mavoko law court.Specifically, the Director of Public Prosecutions said the calls were made between 9am and some minutes to noon, the time Kimani, his client Josephat Mwenda and driver Joseph Muiruri were last seen before they went missing and eventually found murdered. The defence tried to tear into that claim, questioning the duration each call took in attempts to show nothing meaningful would have been conveyed.&ldquo;Can you confirm how long the calls took,&rdquo; asked lawyer Cliff Ombeta.&ldquo;The calls took between 18 seconds to 54 seconds,&rdquo; Nyakundi said.Nyakundi earlier admitted giving a man identified only as Brown his Samsung phone.Brown, according to the prosecution, is police informer Peter Kamau, who is facing charges alongside Fredrick Leliman, Leonard Maina, Sylvia Wanjiku and Stephen Chebulet.&ldquo;Were you ever called for an identification parade to ascertain if the person you gave the phone is among the accused?&rdquo; Nyakundi was asked.He replied, &ldquo;I confirm that no one called. After officers from the Flying Squad took my phone on September 19, no one has ever called me. I am seeing the phone for the first time today in court since then,&rdquo; the witness said.It was also revealed that Nyakundi saw Leliman and Brown having a chat at a restaurant at Mlolongo police station days before June 23, when Kimani, Mwenda and Muiruri were killed.&ldquo;Brown was introduced to me as an AP officer by Leliman. I met Brown four times, when he asked for my phone, that was the third time and I saw him later when he returned the phone,&rdquo; he reaffirmed.Asked if he could point Brown from the dock where the five accused were seated, the officer said Brown was not in the dock.&ldquo;Brown was tall and built and very brown. If I see him I can identify him, but he is not in court today,&rdquo; the witness said.
