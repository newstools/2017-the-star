The National Super Alliance yesterday fine-tuned its nomination rules in a rush to beat the IEBC deadline for submission of their nomination guidelines.According to the IEBC timelines, political parties were to submit their nomination rules between February 20 and March 2.This means the deadline for submitting the rules officially elapsed yesterday.Sources told the Star the National Coordinating Committee was scheduled to meet at 1.30pm yesterday to agree on a few issues before the document is taken to Anniversary Towers.&ldquo;The priority now is to finalise the nomination rules, which we are finalising today,&rdquo; a member of the 12-member committee said.The coordinating committee is also mandated by the NASA Captains &mdash; Raila Odinga, Kalonzo Musyoka, Musalia Mudavadi and Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula &mdash; to pick the joint opposition flagbearer.NASA has been grappling with how to handle its nominations headache, especially in its strongholds, where affiliate parties have strong candidates.These include regions like Mombasa, where Governor Ali Hassan Joho will be facing off with Senator Hassan Omar.In Kakamega, ODM deputy leader Wycliffe Oparanya is locked in a fierce political battle with Ford Kenya deputy leader Boni Khalwale.In its coalition agreement signed last week, NASA said in special circumstances, it will allow more than one coalition candidate in its strongholds.This would be so provided that such a scenario will not undermine support for NASA&rsquo;s presidential candidate or jeopardise the coalition winning the that particular seat.It lists consensus among affiliate parties at the counties and joint primaries as the two major modes of its primaries.&ldquo;The county coordinating committees and the national coordinating committee in consultation with the summit will determine the method to be used in each county and the electoral areas, where exceptions to a single coalition ticket will be granted,&rdquo; the agreement reads in part.NASA is expected to name a nine-member elections board, besides the four parties&rsquo; internal election boards.The super alliance will also have an independent coalition election appeals&rsquo; board of 13 members.Some leaders have expressed fear that forcing a joint nomination under NASA might cause a fallout that may benefit Jubilee. Some want each party under NASA to be allowed to field candidates independently.
