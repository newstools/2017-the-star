South African Geoff Bell is among foreign drivers enlisted for the African Rally Championship Safari on March 17 and 18.Bell will be testing his Datsun 260 Z machine ahead of the 2017 East African Safari Classic Rally slated for November 23 to December 1. The South African oldie who has over the years developed a penchant for marathon rallies will be partnered by regular co-driver, Tim Challen of Kenya.The duo will again do battle in a Datsun 260Z which has been Bell&rsquo;s weapon of choice for three of his five previous Safari Classic rallies.He narrowly missed overall Safari Classic victory in 2011, eventually finishing second behind the late, great Bj&ouml;rn Waldeg&aring;rd in a Porsche 911. Having rallied their 260Z on several continents, Bell and Challen will be a formidable force and real spectator favourites in the Classic category of the forthcoming Safari which will start at KICC on March 17 and finish at Afraha Stadium on March 18.KMSF general manager Mwaura Njoroge said over 10 foreigners have handed in their entries.&ldquo;We have received 52 entries so far. Its good to see Bell back for the umpteenth time. The number of foreigners is quite encouraging. We anticipate some cut-throat competition given that most of the foreigners will be at it to score ARC points,&rdquo; said Mwaura.This year&rsquo;s edition returns to the ARC calendar after a two year hiatus and will traverse the Great Rift Valley region which is synonymous with the defunct WRC Safari.Other foreigners entered for the &ldquo;Worlds Toughest Rally&rdquo; include the Singh siblings of Zambia Muna and Jassy, Jas Mangat of Uganda and Ahmed Huwell of Tanzania.Reigning African Champion Don Smith has entered a Subaru Impreza N14 and will be navigated by current co-drivers champion, Bob Kaugi.Former Britain and Finland rally champion Tapio Laukkanen will be the man to beat at this year&rsquo;s edition. Laukkanen, better known as the &ldquo;Flying Finn&rdquo;- is the defending KNRC Champion and currently the fastest driver on the Kenyan series. Kenyan bigwigs include Carl &ldquo;Flash&rdquo; Tundo, Baldev Chager, Onkar Rai, Manvir Baryan, Quentin Mitchell and the legendary Ian Duncan.Safari Rally 2017 will count towards the second round of the ARC coming after Rallye Bandama of Ivory Coast. It will also serve as the second round of the 2017 Kenya National Rally Championship after Mombasa Rally.
