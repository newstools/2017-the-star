Former Rift Valley politician Jackson Kibor has turned down a judge&rsquo;s suggestion for mediation in a land dispute.Justice Anthony Ambwayo of the Environment and Land Court had asked Kibor and his six sons to settle the dispute out of court with the help of elders.But Kibor (pictured) said he is not ready and willing to settle the row out of court and that he will follow the legal route to its conclusion.&ldquo;There is no way I will mediate with my sons over land which is legally mine as they have continued to trespass on my property, despite a court order barring them to do so. I will soldier on in my bid to reclaim my land through the court process,&rdquo; he said.He said his sons have become a threat to his life and they have blocked him from ploughing a section of his land in preparation for the planting season.Kibor sued seven months ago to block the transfer of 1,250 acres to his sons, 20 years after sub-division of the land in Ziwa, Uasin Gishu county.In his application, he accused his six sons and nine people who used to work on the vast farm of fraudulently subdividing and processing the title deeds. Kibor said he is still the legal landowner.His sons Edwin Kipkoech, Elkana Kipleting, Eric Kipchumba, Evans Kipkosgei, Ezekiel Kipng&rsquo;etich and Raymond Kibitok, together with his third wife Naomi Cheptoo, have denied the allegations. Kibitok said Kibor allocated 20 acres to Samitoi Girls&rsquo; Secondary School, one acre to Seiyo PMCA Church and 22 acres for the construction of a dam.The judge will rule on the status of the feud on April 10.
