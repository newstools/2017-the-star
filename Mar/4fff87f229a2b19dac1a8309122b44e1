IF NASA organises itself very well, reaches out to the people with a clear message, then it will be very difficult for Jubilee.I believe that Jubilee has the capacity and the ability to make inroads into Gusiiland.My conviction and belief is that out of the 30 per cent votes they got at the 2013 general election, they have done a few things which might end up increasing their numbers. If they continue to visit Kisii like they do, it will increase their political dividends because it will give the public more accessibility to the President and his deputy.The roads which the President has authorised to be done in Kisii should continue and if they don't continue, then I doubt whether Jubilee will have any impact whatsoever in Kisii.What is advantageous to the Jubilee team is that the older generation above the age of 30 years are more Jubilee-inclined than ODM.ODM has more younger and youthful people who have been ODM supporters for quite a while.My conviction is that if the President were to engage the community at all levels, the education sector, agriculture, infrastructure, and if the lead Jubilee team from the region would actually settle down in Kisii and get out of Nairobi, they may be able to have an impact. If the President would sustain his campaign to personally engage the community, they may have a soft spot for him, given his history.The Kisii community has always had a soft spot for the Kenyatta family and there is a likelihood that they may have a rethink.I believe the Kisii community is cautiously watching what is happening in the National Super Alliance.If Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka moves out of NASA, then the community may have to rethink their strategy &ndash; and this may favour Jubilee.Historically, the Kisii community has voted on how they know individuals, they may not necessarily vote for someone because of a party.Kisii Governor James Ongwae, Senator Chris Obure and woman representative Mary Otara were all elected on the ODM ticket, yet the party only managed three MPs out of nine in the whole county, while the rest were TNA affiliates.In the county assembly, out of 45 members ODM has 40.All the MPs elected on the ODM ticket have all shifted to Jubilee except me, and that will also definitely have a positive impact.Kitutu Chache South MP
