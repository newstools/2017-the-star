Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli has urged the Luhya community to vote for NASA because it has the winning formula. Speaking to the Star on the phone yesterday, he said ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi and his Ford Kenya counterpart Moses Wetang ula are moving in the right direction. It is important for our people to understand that even if we don t get it, it is better to remain with the winning side than to find ourselves with people who do not care about us, Atwoli said.NASA co-principals Mudavadi, Wetang ula, ODM leader Raila Odinga and Wiper s Kalonzo Musyoka are all eyeing the presidential ticket.Atwoli urged the co-principals to stick together regardless of who wins the ticket to ensure victory against Jubilee.On affiliate parties failing to merge, he said this is a strength. Atwoli said squabbles are part of democracy.
