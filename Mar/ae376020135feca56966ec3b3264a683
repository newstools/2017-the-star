Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli has urged the Luhya community to vote for NASA because &ldquo;it has the winning formula.&rdquo;Speaking to the Star on the phone yesterday, he said ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi and his Ford Kenya counterpart Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula are moving in the right direction.&ldquo;It is important for our people to understand that even if we don&rsquo;t get it, it is better to remain with the winning side than to find ourselves with people who do not care about us,&rdquo; Atwoli said.NASA co-principals Mudavadi, Wetang&rsquo;ula, ODM leader Raila Odinga and Wiper&rsquo;s Kalonzo Musyoka are all eyeing the presidential ticket.Atwoli urged the co-principals to stick together regardless of who wins the ticket to ensure victory against Jubilee.On affiliate parties failing to merge, he said this is a strength. Atwoli said squabbles are part of democracy.
