Nyaribari Chache parliamentary hopeful Zaheer Jhanda wants to become the first non-local to be elected MP in Kisii county. He seeks to unseat incumbent Richard Tong&rsquo;i on the Kanu ticket.The youthful aspirant first ran for the seat in 2013 on the URP ticket and lost to Chris Bichange. He supported Tong&rsquo;i in a by-election in 2014.&ldquo;In 2013, I was still a greenhorn in politics. I have come of age and will give my opponents a run for their money,&rdquo; he told the Star on Wednesday.&ldquo;The people of Nyaribari Chache see me as one of their own. I was born and raised in Kisii town.&rdquo; Others seeking the seat are former MPs Bichange of ODM and Robert Monda, Rachel Otundo of KNC and Ben Mogaka of KSC.
