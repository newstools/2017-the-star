NLC chairman Muhammad Swazuri will be questioned today after a petitioner seeking his removal from office over fraud told MPs he bribed him with Sh1 million.Swazuri was to be questioned by National Assembly Lands Committee chaired by Alex Mwiru (Tharaka MP) yesterday afternoon over claims he received the sum.He asked for more time because &ldquo;I am unwell.&rdquo;The NLC chairman with his lawyer Tom Ojienda told the committee Swazuri arrived in the country from US on Monday night and that he did not have time to prepare to respond to the petition.&ldquo;I received instructions two hours ago and I have no sufficient time to defend Swazuri. A petition seeking to remove a public officer from office requires adequate time to consult,&rdquo; Ojienda said after MPs demanded that his client responds to the petition.Ojienda asked the committee to give them five days to prepare but Mwiru said, &ldquo;Tomorrow [today] at 10am Prof Swazuri should appear before this committee.&rdquo;Petitioner Mugo Njeru and his wife Edith Wairimu accused Swazuri of demanding a bribe of Sh1.2 million to be compensated for their plot which the government acquired for the SGR project.Njeru accompanied by his lawyer Ndegwa Njiru told MPs Swazuri agreed to a Sh1 million bribe after informing him that he could not raise an extra Sh200,000. He confirmed that Swazuri&rsquo;s aide Elijah Fadhili received the cash as instructed by his boss during the meeting at Rotus Hotel in Mombasa in December 2015.&ldquo;I agreed to give the money because I was under duress. I was desperate to get paid from the compensation. In fact that year we did not celebrate Christmas because after taking the money, my account almost remained nil,&rdquo; Njeru said. He added,&rdquo; I met Swazuri but after confirming that I have brought mbuzi [the money] he refused to take and said I should give it to his aide who knows how the money will get to him,&rdquo; Njeru said.The petitioner&rsquo;s 80 acres is located off Mombasa Road in Nairobi. He told the committee a surveyor from the Lands ministry surveyed the disputed land and wrote a report confirming that he was the owner.MPs took issue with Njeru&rsquo;s fraudulent revelations in NLC and demanded he comes clear whether he sought the committee&rsquo;s intervention after his deals with officials at the commission &ldquo;went sour.&rdquo;
