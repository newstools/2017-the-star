Hungry Murang&rsquo;a residents have urged politicians looking for votes to carry food donations during their rallies.Residents of Ithanga in Gatanga constituency said they will not be addressed by leaders who don&rsquo;t leave them food.&ldquo;The situation here is worse. The wild fruits we have been depending on have been exhausted. Every leader seeking votes or holding campaign rallies in this area must come with some food for us, otherwise no one will attend their meetings or listen to them,&rdquo; said Kaguku resident Pauline Wangari.Speaking to the Star on Friday, residents said they have nobody to turn to as the ravaging drought continues. They said the only hope is politicians seeking support at nominations and the August 8 polls.Wangari said hunger has forced their children out of school to assist their parents to gather fruits and fetch water. &ldquo;All wells are dry and the nearest place we can get clean water for domestic use is 20km from our home. Our children can&rsquo;t concentrate in school due to hunger,&rdquo; she said.The mother of two said the region depends on rain-fed agriculture and the poor rains received last year led to massive crop failure.
