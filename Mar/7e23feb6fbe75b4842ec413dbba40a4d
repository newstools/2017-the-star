The US government is monitoring volatile areas in the Rift Valley ahead of the coming elections.This came as the US said it would donate Sh8.5 billion to the IEBC for civic education and peace building campaigns.This emerged when US ambassador Robert Godec held a two-hour meeting with leaders in a Naivasha hotel.Among those that met the ambassador were politicians, representatives from pastoralists and the fishing community, farmers and traders in the hospitality industry.During the meeting, Godec enquired on the political status ahead of the elections, saying in 2007 the town was among those hardest hit by the post-election violence.The ambassador was concerned about the situation in Naivasha where some communities have fled prior to the elections.Speaking after the meeting, former Naivasha mayor Pharis Chege said they assured Godec Naivasha was peaceful and safe.Chege termed the 2007-08 PEV as the darkest moment for the town and added that the town would never follow that route again.&ldquo;We had a very fruitful meeting with the US ambassador and we have assured him that we are committed to peaceful elections and no community is fleeing,&rdquo; he said.David Kilo, who represented the fishing community, said various issues, including the coming elections, compensation for IDPs and civic education, were discussed.He said unlike other victims of the post-election violence, those from Naivasha were never compensated and are still suffering, 10 years down the line.Kilo urged the US government to chip in to conserve Lake Naivasha, terming it the mainstay of the lakeside town and the horticulture industry.Enock Kiminta from the Water Resource Users Association accused KenGen of overusing lake water.Kiminta, who also represented pastoralists, warned that the massive abstraction of water is one of the major challenges facing the water body.&ldquo;The ambassador was very candid and promised that he would try to assist in some of the many issues that were raised during the meeting,&rdquo; he said.
