The removal of Football Kenya Federation Nyanza North branch chairman, Joseph Andere from the powerful position of finance committee boss at the national football body has brought to the fore simmering tensions within the federation. Andere was replaced by his Nairobi counterpart, Chris Amimo in that position and declined to take the &lsquo;lesser&rsquo; docket of youth committee as well as a role in the Local Organizing Committee for the 2018 Chan Cup.While refusing to wade into the decision by Andere not to take the positions offered to him by the Nec, FKF CEO Robert Muthomi revealed that the move to replace him as a normal one. &ldquo;Reshuffles do happen in the committee and this one was a procedural one. However, I can&rsquo;t comment on why Andere declined to take up his other position because it was a personal decision,&rdquo; Muthomi remarked.The federation chief executive also refuted insinuations that the change of guard was done behind the Nyanza Nec members back, revealing he had been invited to the meeting but he sent his apologies as he was held up elsewhere. FKF Nyanza North branch secretary general, Dickson Oruko, said the region was now disadvantaged since they had no representation in the committee after the dismissal of Andere from the key position.&ldquo;We voted for the new office but unfortunately, Nyanza now doesn&rsquo;t have any representation in any of the committees after Andere was relieved off the finance docket, before declining the youth committee docket,&rdquo; said Oruko. Andere, who didn&rsquo;t want to disclose his reasons for declining the two new appointments is believed to be angered by the football chiefs&rsquo; move to replace him during a NEC meeting convened in his absentia.Andere has not been enjoying a good relation with the rest of his executive members, especially after bad blood between the football chiefs and top league organisers Kenyan Premier League (KPL) Limited escalated following the league expansion debate and the Club Licensing implementation.Some top federation bosses see Andere as KPL sympathiser, owing to the fact that he doubles up as the deputy finance manager at KPL, having been appointed when Agro Chemical were playing in the top flight league while he was team leader.
