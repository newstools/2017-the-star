The Education ministry will establish the National Open University of Kenya to provide quality education for people who work long hours and cannot attend regular classes.NOUK was proposed 20 years ago, but has never been implemented.It is expected to offer programmes on open and distance learning module.The decision was made following a report by the Commission for University Education two weeks ago on the quality of university education.On Tuesday, Education CS Fred Matiang&rsquo;i said the quality education in universities has been compromised and the ministry wants to correct it. He spoke at the Catholic University of Eastern Africa.Matiang&rsquo;i said the ministry is drafting a proposal for the establishment of NOUK, after which a bill will be presented to Parliament. &ldquo;If Parliament approves, then we expect funding in the budget allocation next year,&rdquo; the CS said.The CS said the ministry is working on breaking the barrier between public and private universities for fair competition.
