Nominated Senator Martha Wangari has urged the Public Service Commission and the office of the Attorney General to explain to Kenyans why Council of Legal Education CEO Kulundu Bitonye has stayed in office beyond the mandatory retirement age.She said despite Kenyans raising concerns over Bitonye&rsquo;s tenure, PSC and AG Githu Muigai&rsquo;s office have remained silent. &ldquo;The two offices should end this matter. Kenyans have been seeking answers on the claims that Bitonye has overstayed beyond the stipulated age and no one is providing them,&rdquo; Wangari told the Star yesterday.The Senate Labour Committee vice chairperson urged the National Assembly&rsquo;s Justice and Legal Affairs Committee to expedite the petition filed in December by Anunda Marendi and Vincent Yegon.
