More than 10 officials of teachers’ unions Knut and Kuppet want to run for election. They include Kuppet national chairman Omboko Milemba, who wants to replace Emuhaya MP Wilber Ottichilo. The MP wants to run for Vihiga governor against Moses Akaranga. Knut Busia executive secretary Mark Oseno wants to replace Funyula MP Paul Otuoma, who wants to run for governor against incumbent Sospeter Ojaamong. Omboko and Oseno are seeking the ANC ticket. Knut Kakamega East chairman Patrick Chungani wants to be Shinyalu MP. Knut Lugari woman representative Fatuma Osundwa has joined the contest for Kakamega county woman MP. Chungani on Friday said most of them are joining politics to influence formulation of policies and regulations friendly to teachers. “We have realised we assist politicians using our networks but they abandon us once elected,” he said. “We want to use the same networks to enter Parliament so we have an opportunity to push the teachers’ agenda at a higher level.” Some analysts say unionists are attracted by politicians’ hefty salaries.
