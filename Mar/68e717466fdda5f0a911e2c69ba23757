Kenyatta National Hospital has sacked 12 doctors for taking part in the strike that enters its 95th day today.CEO Lily Koros said they had been advised against participating as the strike was illegal and assured that they would be protected under the law.She said 48 doctors were issued with show-cause letters in January and are undergoing disciplinary action.&ldquo;The management is now fast-tracking the disciplinary process to have cases determined expeditiously to the full extent provided by the law,&rdquo; Koros said.She directed all striking doctors employed by the hospital to return to work.Failing that, the medics will face disciplinary action that includes summary dismissal, eviction from hospital quarters and other administrative action, Koros said.Some doctors at the hospital have been treating patients in critical condition since their strike began on December 5 last year.A nurse told the Star yesterday that KNH medics have also been responding to distress calls.&ldquo;The management has, on several occasions, called doctors to attend to severe cases. They have been responding positively,&rdquo; she said.Kenya Defence Forces&rsquo; doctors deployed to the hospital have also been attending to patients and processing admissions.KMPDU has maintained that the government has to implement the amended 2013 CBA on salaries and working conditions for the strike to end. Talks hit a dead end after the government said it will not meet the doctors&rsquo; demands, adding that the strike was illegal. It accused doctors of blackmail.President Uhuru Kenyatta on Tuesday said the Sh14.5 billion offer doctors rejected was all the state could give. He ordered the doctors to go back to work and threatened to take action against those who will not.The opposition yesterday accused the government of high-handedness in dealing with the crisis. NASA principal Kalonzo Musyoka said doctors have a right to call for higher pay.He spoke at the Fourth Devolution Conference in Naivasha. Kalonzo said threatening doctors with sack notices is an indication that the Jubilee administration is taking Kenya back to the dark days.
