Religious leaders yesterday asked the electoral agency to tell Kenyans the truth about its preparedness to conduct a credible, free and fair election in August.The leaders, under the Multi-Sectoral Forum, said it was contradictory for the IEBC to claim it has sufficient time to conduct the polls and at the same time complain of having lost significant time.Secretary general Canon Peter Karanja said the current court injunctions against the IEBC in relation to preparations for the polls are a clear indication that if measures are not taken, the IEBC might deliver a compromised election. &ldquo;It will be so unfair for the IEBC to deliver compromised results because it failed to adequately prepare,&rdquo; he said.Karanja said public confidence in the IEBC, Judiciary and National Police Service is very low.&ldquo;We are worried that such low levels of trust have the potential to inspire politicians competing for power to reject the entire electoral process, regardless of the quality of the work done by the institutions,&rdquo; he said.The IEBC should set things right by cleaning up the voter register and party nominations, Karanja said.The leaders said it was worrying that with only 137 days to the general election, the electronic voter identification devices and result transmission systems have not been procured.He also cautioned leaders against inflammatory statements that could incite violence.
