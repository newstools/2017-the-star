Ford Kenya secretary general Eseli Simiyu has accused the office of the Registrar of Political Parties of registering people into political parties they do not want to be in. The Tongaren MP said NASA will streamline and clean up the office if it captures power on August 8. He was addressing a press conference after a meeting with the party's National Elections Board and aspirants at Mabanga Farmers Training Centre in Kanduyi on Saturday.''We have noted with concern that in various counties we have been traversing popularising our party, we have so many of our members registered in parties they do not belong to or wish to be in without there knowledge,'' he said. ''If you are recruiting party members, there must be a proper direction to do so, not without there knowledge.''Simiyu said half of the more than 60 political parties in Kenya did not recruit members in the right manner.He urged registrar Lucy Ndung'u to clean up her office or leave it for NASA to do it if it is reelected.Simiyu said the problem might not be as simple as she might think.He said in NASA, everything is okay ahead of nominations.Simiyu said all parties will conduct fair nominations as a sign of democracy.He said it is unfortunate that some candidates want direct tickets, which will not happen.Simiyu warned members not to be used by Jubilee to disrupt and bring confusion in NASA, adding that he is aware Jubilee will sponsor some Ford Kenya members.
