Could politician Mike Mutembei be the man behind NASA&rsquo;s increasing popularity in Meru and Tharaka Nithi counties, which have been considered to be Jubilee Party strongholds?Mutembei, who was involved in an accident eight years ago which left him paralysed, is a businessman and philanthropist.After Tigania East MP Mpuru Aburi and Igembe Central MP Kubai Kiringo decamped from ODM and joined Jubilee, the opposition settled on Mutembei to market it in the region.On Saturday, Mutembei, popularly known as Makarina, said the Meru community has been used by Kikuyus for years, but they have not benefitted from the friendship.&ldquo;The people of Meru are tired of being used by our Kikuyu neighbours. The reason why Meru and Tharaka Nithi have shifted to supporting NASA is because we have nothing to be proud of and our people are suffering,&rdquo; he said.Mutembei said he is not interested in running for office. &ldquo;I have been helping people for free and I don&rsquo;t seek any elective post. Al I want is to educate Kenyans, especially our Meru people. Raila is the best person to lead this country. He understands the challenges of every region,&rdquo; he said.
