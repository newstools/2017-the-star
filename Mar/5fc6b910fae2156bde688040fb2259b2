Kenya Pipeline coach Japheth Munala has admitted he is spoilt for choice even as he prepares to name a 14-member traveling squad to the Africa Club Championship set for April 5-8 in Kelibia, Tunisia.The local champions, who settled for bronze medal in the 2016 edition in Tunis, are hoping to go a step higher and win the title. The provisional squad of 18 players are currently undergoing residential training at the Safaricom Indoor Arena, Kasarani.Munala said unlike the previous events where he has had easy time picking the team, this time the competition for slots is on another level.&ldquo;There is no room for wildcards. The youngsters in the team have shown growth and maturity and really it is hard to decided who will make the cut. But all in all, I must admit this is the strongest squad I have ever had in years and that is a good thing,&rdquo; said Munala, who has guided the local champions to win the Kenya Volleyball Federation national league title back-to-back since 2014.He added: &ldquo;It is a good thing to have a pool of players, who can equally perform well when called upon in their respective departments. We hope the good preparation we have had will reflect in our performance.&rdquo;Captain Triza Atuka will fight for the centre position alongside Violet Makuto, who was voted the best blocker in the last edition, Valentine Chepkoech, Yvonne Sinaida and Beldine Akinyi.Esther Wangeci, Gaudencia Makokha, Jane Ochoo and fast-improving Christine Njambi will be eyeing the right attackers&rsquo; position while the fight for the left attackers slots will revolve around Noel Murambi, Monica Biama, Leonida Kasaya, Naomi Too and Edina Mwombe.Libero slots will pit former national team libero Mildred Odwako, KVF best libero Agrippina Kundu and fast-raising Cellestine Nyongesa who was part of the under-23 women&rsquo;s team that qualified for this year&rsquo;s World Championship to be staged in SLjubljana and Maribo in Slovenia.
