The number of new vehicles sold in the first two months of this year fell by more than a third in the first two months of the year, industry data showed yesterday.Fresh data from the Kenya Motor Industry Association shows the country's industry sales volume dropped by 35 per cent to 808 units from 1,243 units in February last year.Market leader General Motors February 2017 sales closed at 261 units compared to 403 units sold in a similar period in 2016, a 35.23 per cent.This comes in the wake of American giant General Motors announcement to exit the East African market next month, with the sale of its entire 57.7 per cent stake in General Motors East Africa to Isuzu Motors of Japan.GMEA, however, dominated the market with a 32.6 per cent market share despite a 0.3 point drop from last year&rsquo;s 32.9 per cent share. The exit of GM marks an end to its operations in the region spanning more than four decades.Toyota sales in the two months dropped by 9.5 per cent year-on-year to 362 units compared to 399 units sold in February last year, despite light trucks remaining the most bought vehicles in the market.Simba Colt sold 258 units down from 481 units by February 2016, a 46.4 per cent drop. CMC sold 121 units down from 231 sold in a similar period in last year.DT Dobie sold 71 units down from 111 units, Tata 99 from 107 units while Crown sold 76 units, a 32 per cent drop from last years&rsquo; 112 units. Other models accounted for 69 units a drop from last February&rsquo;s 177.The market has continued to feel the heat from the capping of interest rates which has squeezed credit access in the private sector, as banks opt to invest in government securities.Most buyers of new vehicles, such as light commercial trucks, rely on asset financing facilities by banks, but the capping of interest rates in August last year has led to reduced loans to the private sector.
