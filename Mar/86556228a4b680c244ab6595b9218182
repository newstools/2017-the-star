The Jubilee politician, who lost during the Malindi MP by-election last year, has made a grand return to the ground to campaign. Philip Charo lost to ODM's Willy Mtengo in March last year. Charo came second with 9,000 votes, against Mtengo's 14,000. Charo has said he is now confident of winning the seat, saying the one year Mtengo has served as MP has "proven he is incompetent and has no vision" to take Malindi constituency to the next level. Charo has been holding meetings to bring people together and push his bid for election in August. On Friday, Charo met leaders from Shella ward in Kasufini and urged them not to reelect Mtengo. â€œMalindi people made a big mistake by electing Mtengo. How can one be a leader who operates alone without the support of MCAs, this hinders development," he said. Charo said gave Mtengo time to prove his leadership skills and unite people . He said he is the only candidate who can transform Malindi to a better constituency. During last year's by-election, there was only one Jubilee Party candidate. But this year, there is a newcomer in politics Peter Mwawana, also seeking the Jubilee ticket for the Malindi seat. Charo and Mwawana will battle it out during the nominations next month. In ODM, Kilifi woman representative Aisha Jumwa will battle it out with Mtengo during the nominations, which are expected to be tough. In Wiper, parliamentary hopeful Rashid Odhiambo will not be going for nomination as he is the only one in the race. Charo was accompanied by Chistine Zawadi, a nominated MCA who is vying for the woman representative seat on the Jubilee ticket. Others were Wanje Baya an aspiring MCA Shella ward and Justin Rafiki a party official.
