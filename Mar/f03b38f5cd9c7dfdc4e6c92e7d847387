"This is the closest we will ever get to repealing and replacing Obamacare," Ryan added.McConnell had a similar message for fellow Republicans: "We need to deliver.""When you have a president of a different party, you can freelance all you want to," McConnell told an event sponsored by the Politico news organization.
