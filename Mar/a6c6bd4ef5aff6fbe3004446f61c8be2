A brother has taken his stepsisters to court over the estate of his late mother.John Kioi is accusing Mary Wangui and Salome Njeri of trying to alienate matrimonial property belonging to his late mother Rhoda Wairimu and wants the court to stop it.The two stepsisters were appointed executors of the estate by their late father, but Kioi says, this does not give them any right to his mother&rsquo;s matrimonial property left for him.Court documents say Wairimu owned land in Dagoretti, 2.02 hectares in Gilgil, a plot in Naivasha, land in Karai, 0.9 hectares in Karen, Kenya Breweries shares and money in two accounts &ndash; one in Hurlingham and another in Kikuyu. The estimated value of the estate is Sh50 million. In her will, Wairimu mentions her son as the executor and left her matrimonial property to him. His mother died on April 22, 2013.At the time of her death, she was living in her matrimonial home, where she had stayed for 37 years.The title deed to the land was in the name of her late husband James Karanja. Before his death, Karanja wrote a will dated February 6, 1992, in which he appointed Wangui and Njeri executors.
