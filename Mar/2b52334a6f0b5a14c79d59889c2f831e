The Senate yesterday gave more time to Kenya Pipeline Company and its Lebanese contractor to shed light on the controversial Sh43 billion deal for the ongoing construction of the Mombasa-Nairobi pipeline.KPC and Zakhem International Construction, the main contractor, failed to appear before the Committee on Energy yesterday. The two were directed to appear before the committee on March 14.Committee chairman Gideon Moi yesterday said the committee &ldquo;was now suspecting elements of international fraud&rdquo; after the two failed to show up. Moi said his committee has given Zakhem, KPC and their sub-contractors two weeks to appear, failing which it will issue a summon.&ldquo;We feel there are elements of fraud that have been perpetuated,&rdquo; Moi told a reporter. &ldquo;We have given them another two weeks to appear.&rdquo;However, KPC said in a statement to newsrooms that Zakhem has begun installation works for the eight mainline pumps which have arrived in the country.Managing director Joe Sang said the project is on course and will be ready for commissioning by mid this year, two months behind the initial target of April 2017. &ldquo;The new line once complete will adequately serve the country&rsquo;s demand which is projected to be 6.8 billion litres in 2020,&rdquo; Sang said.Zakhem officials were reportedly out of the country while KPC told the committee that its officials had been given a short notice. Moi said the committee is contemplating ordering for a complete audit of the entire Sh43 billion pipeline project, to ascertain if there was value for taxpayers money.Only three sub-contractors &ndash; Quality Inspectors Limited, Straccon Engineering Ltd and Dynamic Green Technologies Ltd &ndash; appeared. There were reports that Audi Okullo, infrastructure general manager at Kenya Pipeline, who was in charge of the project, has resigned due to internal and external pressure.Zakhem, the main contractor, has made a cost variation claim demanding an additional payment of Sh11 billion. It is reported to have received Sh30 billion for 65 per cent of the work.On February 2, the Parliamentary Public Investments Committee ordered the KPC to halt the additional payment.
