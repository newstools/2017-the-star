Nyatike MP Edick Anyanga has faulted ODM leader Raila Odinga&rsquo;s spokesman Dennis Onyango for critcising his reelection bid.Anyanga said on Tuesday the same people behind the shambolic nominations in the constituency are at it again, using their relatives and godfathers in the party.On Saturday, Onyango, who is from Nyatike, posted on Facebook that he is sure Anyanga will be kicked out during the primaries on April 19.He said it is not by accident that Nyatike will be among the first constituencies to hold nominations.&ldquo;Nyatike must get a new MP. It is my expectation that the new MP will have the courage to go after our money and have every coin accounted for,&rdquo; Onyango wrote.He was reacting to a Facebook post by Kennedy Okong&rsquo;o, a lawyer and former Nyatike CDF chairman, who lost to Anyanga in 2007.Okong&rsquo;o had posted that although he lost, Nyatike residents should use their voting power wisely to elect leaders, adding that their collective future depends on it.But Anyanga said, &ldquo;If you work at the [ex-] Prime Minister&rsquo;s office, do your role. You should not use your position to attack politicians. Some things are best left to politicians to say.&rdquo;He said only one politician has been behind shambolic nominations in Nyatike, where ballot boxes were kicked and destroyed in the last primaries.&ldquo;My rivals are lucky because they have their relatives in high offices to push through their nominations. I have been lucky to survive by support of the people,&rdquo; Anyanga said.He spoke in Sori town when he flagged off two school buses worth Sh11.6 million for BL Tezza and Kanga Onditi secondary schools.The buses were part of his campaign pledges in 2013.
