The youth have been urged to apply for the 30 per cent government tenders set aside for them instead of engaging in crime. Tourism PS Fatuma Hirsi urged women and persons with disabily to take up opportunities availed by the national government to access credit and other investment opportunities. She spoke on Saturday in Wajir during an Access of Government Procurement Services campaign. Youths were taught procurement procedures, accounting and auditing, finance and legal issues pertaining to registration of companies. Hirsi said this will play a major role in protecting young people against radicalisation, which is rampant in Northeastern counties. â€œI believe through access to these services the youth will get an opportunity to earn a living and also contribute positively to the society," she said. Hirsi urged the national and county governments to provide equal opportunities to all the genders in leadership and elective positions, as stipulated in the constitution.
