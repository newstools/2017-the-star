Safaricom will from next week halve commissions for Lipa Na M-Pesa merchants to 0.5 per cent of the transaction value from one per cent. Lipa Na M-Pesa merchants will be charged a flat fee of Sh200 for any payments above Sh40,000, the giant telco announced yesterday. Safaricom&rsquo;s reduction of the Lipa Na M-Pesa tariffs and inclusion of more financial institutions under real time settlements largely targets small and micro businesses such as kiosks, bodabodas, matatus, newspaper vendors, hawkers, hotels, restaurants and small eateries.Lipa Na M-Pesa paybill, gaming merchants and petrol station tariffs will not be affected by the changes. &ldquo;We trust that this development will boost the attractiveness of the Lipa Na M-Pesa platform to more small and medium enterprises while making the service more affordable compared to other alternatives in the market,&rdquo; CEO Bob Collymore said in a statement.The telco also said it will expand the M-Pesa Kadogo tariff announced in October 2016 for Lipa Na M-Pesa buy goods, to enable merchants to receive all transactions of Sh200 and below at no cost. Merchants will also enjoy the convenience of instant processing of payments made through Lipa Na M-Pesa to their bank accounts, with the service now available at 23 participating banks. This will cut down the time that it takes to move money from a Lipa Na M-Pesa till to a bank account from as much as 28 hours down to seconds.
