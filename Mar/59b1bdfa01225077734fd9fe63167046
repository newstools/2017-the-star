State House has said the government will only negotiate with doctors to end their long strike if they agree to return to work as ordered.Spokesperson Manoah Esipisu reiterated President Uhuru Kenyatta s message on Sunday, saying the government would not longer entertain games on an illegal strike. Uhuru has directed that all doctors resume duty before any further negotiations can be convened, he told the press at State House in Mombasa. We note the union s statement on the subject. Uhuru s resolve and message remains the same: no more chicanery."Doctors made the request after the President last week said he had come to the end of his patience with them as they rejected the best deals ever offered to Kenyan public servants.The doctors had rejected a 40 per cent salary increase and a further Sh600 million as backdated allowances.The government has now ordered the doctors to return to work or face the sack.Uhuru told governors at the devolution conference in Naivasha that doctors will have a problem should the mediation led by church leaders bear no fruit.He said the health workers were only out to blackmail the government by staging a health crisis, a situation he said is not acceptable."If the mediation by religious leaders fails, we will have a problem with them and we will sort them out," he told the meeting last Tuesday.More on this: We will have a problem if pay talks flop, Uhuru warns striking doctorsAbout 5,000 doctors in public hospitals have been on strike since December 5, 2016, demanding implementation of the 2013 CBA they signed with the Ministry of Health. It covers higher pay and better working conditions.The government said it was ready to negotiate a new CBA but insisted that the one the doctors signed in 2013 cannot be implemented because it was not registered.
