The parliamentary committee investigating embattled Auditor General Edward Ouko over a Sh100 million tender can go on with its work if it wishes as there is no order stopping it for now.Ouko had sued president Uhuru Kenyatta and the National Assembly seeking to block his removal from office.High Court Judge George Odunga only granted him permission to seek injunctive orders but did not, at this stage, grant any order blocking the committee.But he directed that the matter be placed before constitutional division judge Chacha Mwita on Monday.This means Ouko can try convincing the court why he deserves an order stopping his investigation. The committee is expected to question the Director of Public Prosecutions Keriako Tobiko over the saga.Read: Fresh plot to remove Auditor OukoAlso read: Can&rsquo;t a Luo have a big state job?
