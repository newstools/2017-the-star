Kwale woman representative Zainab Chidzuga &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t know&rdquo; her work and has spent her term fighting, sabotaging and disrespecting Governor Salim Mvurya, an aspirant has said.Former Kwale Public Service Board vice chairperson Fatuma Tabwara yesterday said she wants to take over as woman representative to ensure services and development.&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t know your work I am ready to take over from you, Mama Chidzuga. Residents want services and development, not insults,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;We should elect leaders who are ready to deliver on their mandate because residents want services.&rdquo;Tabwara wants to run on the Jubilee Party ticket, as does Chidzuga.&ldquo;I know there is a women rep in Jubilee already, but I want to tell her that there are nominations and I am ready to face her,&rdquo; she said in Lunga Lunga.Tabwara is said to be Mvurya&rsquo;s preferred candidate for woman representative.Chidzuga and Mvurya have been at loggerheads for a long time, even when they were both in ODM. Their differences escalated when they joined Jubilee.Tabwara said the county wants leaders who will work together and not those who want to override others&rsquo; work.Chidzuga has maintained that she is ready for the nominations and optimistic of winning.She and senator aspirant Mshenga Ruga dismissed claims that Kwale is a NASA zone.Kwale residents have not benefitted from supporting the opposition and they should carefully select leaders who will deliver, Ruga said.He said residents have now shifted their goals and are supporting the government.Kwale Jubilee deputy organising secretary Khatib Mtengo said the county is no longer a Cord zone.&ldquo;Parties don&rsquo;t serve the electorate, but leaders do and so citizens should be careful when electing leaders,&rdquo; he said.
