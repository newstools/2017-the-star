Wanjiru got nine votes out of the 15 cast. Irungu got eight votes.Members accused Kamau and Macharia of gross misconduct, lack of transparency and conducting the party&rsquo;s affairs unprofessionally.Speaking at a press briefing in Kenol town on Tuesday, the new officials said officials resolved to kick out the two after a meeting in Murang&rsquo;a town on February 21.&ldquo;Party members, aspirants and stakeholders from across the county have been registering complaints on the conduct of the two officials.

A member who asked for anonymity said that during the February 21 meeting Kamau admitted he had taken money from an aspirant.&ldquo;He told us to our faces that he had pocketed the cash.
