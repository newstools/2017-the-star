Treasury CS Henry Rotich is responsible for budget ceilings in various state ministries and departments, a parliamentary oversight committee has said.The Parliamentary Budget Office yesterday said the National Treasury has been ignoring its recommendations on budgets of state departments to observe the ceilings when the ministries allocate funds.The Public Finance Management Act demands Rotich consider the resolutions passed by Parliament in finalising the Budget for the relevant financial year.&ldquo;However, for the period under review, 2017-18, the Cabinet Secretary did not adhere to the ceilings of the BPS,&rdquo; an official from the Parliamentary Budget Office told the Labour committee.Given more cash than allowed&ldquo;For instance, the budget allocations for the state department for Sports Development exceeded ceilings by Sh60 million for Labour, Sh845.4 million for Social Protection, Sh21 million for Arts and Culture, Sh571.75 million for Public Service and Sh453.6 million for Youth Affairs,&rdquo; the official said.Sports Development has been allocated Sh2.76 billion, Labour Sh3.07 billion, Social Protection Sh24.25 billion, Arts and Culture Sh3.85 billion, and the Public Service and Youth Affairs Sh26.28 billion in the 2017-18 budget estimates. The PBO was briefing MPs on the performance of state departments the committee approves annual budgets for and oversights.The departments under the committee&rsquo;s watch include Sports, Labour, Public Service (comprising of Gender and Youth Affairs) and the National Gender and Equality Commission.Rotich usually says his ministry remains committed to ceilings by undertaking austerity measures across all government institutions.Proposal to reduce allocations&ldquo;There is need to reduce the amounts allocated to these departments in order to adhere to the Budget Policy Statement ceilings,&rdquo; the official said.She added, &ldquo;The committee needs to advice the agencies to formulate more laws, including Acts and guidelines, that will guide the operations of the state departments for better results.&rdquo;The committee was told huge pending bills caused by delayed, non-exchequer releases or reorganisation of government leading to later transfer of funds take a bulk of the departments&rsquo; budgets.&ldquo;There is need to evaluate the level of pending bills for every state department before approving the allocations,&rdquo; the committee was told.MPs were, however, told huge pending bills are attributed to Treasury&rsquo;s austerity measures reducing their budgets.The departments are also put on the spot for failing to account for funds and projects initiated in the previous financial year and again requesting for funds for similar projects in the current financial year.
