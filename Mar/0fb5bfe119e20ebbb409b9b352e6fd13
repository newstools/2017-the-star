The regional capital markets regulators have agreed to support the establishment of a Capital Markets Advisory Centre to help small and medium enterprises raise funds for growth and development.The dominant SMEs have long been deprived of funds from commercial banks, with the launch of Growth Enterprise Market Segment at the Nairobi Securities Exchange in 2013 doing little to help the SMEs raise capital.Under the umbrella of the East African Securities Regulatory Authorities, CMAC is expected to provide technical support to SMEs with a view to developing a credible pipeline of entities, able to access private and public market- based finance.&ldquo;The decision to set up CMAC was made with the recognition that SMEs need to be supported to access alternative forms of long term capital, thereby reducing their dependence on short-term bank financing in order to spur their growth and boost employment,&rdquo; EASRA said in a statement yesterday.The institution&rsquo;s support is expected to focus on pre-listing, listing and post-listing support services.&ldquo;EASRA members will engage with private equity, accounting and other associations, development partners, academia, think tanks, and civil society organisations. Partners will be called upon to provide advocacy and technical support,&rdquo; Kenya&rsquo;s Capital Markets Authority said in a statement.The regulators are also mulling over full implementation of risk-based supervision and regional capacity building programmes through partnership with the Chartered Institute for Securities and Investment to ensure certification of industry players.The region is also pushing for harmonization of the legal and regulatory framework for capital markets. The advisory centre will be a boost for SMEs in the region majority of whom cannot afford technical services like legal and corporate restructuring.Capital Markets Authorities of Kenya and Uganda, and the Capital Markets and Securities Authority of Tanzania signed a Memorandum of Understanding and adopted a common blue print on the integration of the East African Capital Markets in 1997. The Capital Markets Authority of Rwanda later joined EASRA in 2009.
