A group of more than 700 people is claiming part of the 27,000 acres in Eldoret occupied by former nominated MP Mark Too&rsquo;s family, after 3,000 squatters won a case over the land last month.Too died on December 31 last year at the age of 64. Too was buried on the disputed land on January 9, while the case filed by the squatters was still going on at the High Court.Squatters own Too&rsquo;s landOn February 8, judge Anthony Obwayo declared that the squatters own the land and ordered that all title deeds issued on the 27,000 acres be cancelled.He ruled that Too&rsquo;s family will only retain about 60 acres of the land located between Eldoret Airport and Moi University.Too&rsquo;s family has moved to the Court of Appeal to challenge Obwayo&rsquo;s ruling. The family insists that Too had bought the land and fully owned it.However, the new group say members bought 1,000 acres of the land from the East African Tanning and Extract Company, which was owned by Lonrho East Africa Ltd.&ldquo;We have stayed on the land for more than 15 years as the rightful owners and we will not accept to vacate,&rdquo; the new group&rsquo;s spokesman, Kibyego Sawe, said.He said they all have title deeds for the land they bought.&ldquo;We bought the land genuinely from Eatec and the government is fully aware of how we acquired it,&rdquo; Sawe said.Squatters have been threatening to invade the 27,000 acres occupied by Too&rsquo;s family after a court ruled that the land belongs to them.Moi gave them landObwayo ruled on Wednesday that the squatters had been genuinely allocated the land during President Moi&rsquo;s regime and it should be given to them.He said documents show the land should have been distributed to 800 families.When the ruling was made, the squatters&rsquo; chairman, Benjamin Rono, said, &ldquo;We are happy that Justice has finally been done and we will act as per the court order.&rdquo;He said they had been holding meetings to ensure the court order is enforced.
