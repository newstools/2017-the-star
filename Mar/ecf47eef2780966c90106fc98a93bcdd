Hundreds of Kisumu residents took to the streets on Friday to protest alleged plans to sell the Sh4.2 billion Lake Basin Development Authority mall.Led by Youth Reconciliation Forum of Kenya director Erick Okello, they demanded to know why the mall has not been operationalised. They accused Devolution CS Mwangi Kiunjuri of deliberately delaying to pay the contractor upon receiving a report on the mall. Okello accused powerful individuals in Jubilee government of plotting to buy the mall but said this will not be tolerated.&ldquo;We are the taxpayers and that mall must benefit locals. Those who think they can maneuver to buy the mall through illegal deals are in for a rude shock,&rdquo; he said.He said AG Githu Muigai, in his capacity as government adviser, and Auditor General Edward Ouko have on occasion asked Kiunjuri to pay the contractor.&ldquo;We are also aware that Sh2.5 billion owed to the contractor is deliberately not being paid so as to accrue interest to make interested parties purchase the mall at the expense of Kisumu residents,&rdquo; he said.The delay has seen the project accrue Sh1.5 million interests per day to Cooperative Bank &ndash; the projects' financier &ndash; per day, Okello added."We are sending a strong signal to anyone who may want to sell or buy the mall that it will be brought down or burnt if it does not benefit the people of Kisumu," he said.Resident Hassan Abdalla asked President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto to "come clean" over the allegations."It is unacceptable and unconstitutional to frustrate the process of handing over the premise to serve its purpose...public funds were used to build it," Hassan said.Read: LBDA director told me to stop query on cash &ndash; SavulaOn Thursday, Nyando MP Fred Outa threatened to reveal the names of those interested in buying the mall.Outa said, following the budget reading, that the government should offset the debt that has delayed the mall's hand-over.He said Jubilee administration was secretly planning to auction the mall but that Nyanza leaders will not allow this.&ldquo;We know they have been stealing a lot of projects in Kenya. This one in Kisumu county will not be sold. It is therefore upon the government to clear the debt within a week,&rdquo; Outa said.In December 2016, Outa and Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi raised the alarm over plans to transfer the mall's ownership to &ldquo;well-connected individuals within the Jubilee administration&rdquo;.More on this: Wandayi, Outa allege plot to auction Kisumu's Sh4bn Lake Basin Authority mallThey termed the plan "yet another scandal of the Jubilee administration" and accused the Devolution ministry of being used in the execution of the plot.Furthermore, they said the delays have seen the project accrue Sh145 million interest to Co-operative Bank &ndash; the projects' financier &ndash; per day.The MPs asked Uhuru to immediately intervene on the matter so as to safeguard public interest on the multi-billion project situated at Mamboleo junction on Kisumu-Kakamega highway.Early this month, former TNA secretary general Onyango Oloo was on the spot for illegally signing and inflating a contract by a staggering Sh1.41 billion.Oloo found himself on the wrong side of the law after documents tabled in Parliament revealed he signed a contract for the building of the Lake Basin Development Authority mall in Kisumu yet he was not an executive chairman
