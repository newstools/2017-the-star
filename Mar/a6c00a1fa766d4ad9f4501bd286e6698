The state has gazetted 19 areas in Baringo county as disturbed and dangerous, paving way for police operation to weed out bandits.In a notice issued on February 28, Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery said the order shall remain in force for the next 30 days.He said this will be subject to revocation or extension, probably depending on the state's assessment of the situation in the clash-torn Kerio Valley."In exercise of the powers conferred by Section 106 (1) of the National Police Service Act, 2011, the Cabinet Secretary for Interior...in consultation with the National Security Council, declares that certain administrative locations of Baringo County as disturbed and dangerous," the gazette notice reads in part.Those listed include; Kerio Valley has suffered a spate of bandit attacks for the past four months, leaving a trail of deaths and destruction of property.On Monday, Deputy President William Ruto installed an additional 255 police reservists to help security officers in containing the attacks.This came after the DP's meeting was disrupted after suspected bandits fired shots barely a few metres from the meeting.Read: Ruto issues shoot-to-kill order after daring bandits disrupt his Baringo visitAlso read: Bold bandits kill chief during DP Ruto's Baringo visit The attacks, whose motive remains unknown, have left 10 dead, many others injured with another 30,000 displaced from their homes.Baringo county commissioner Peter Okwanyo says there are 5,000 to 6,000 illegal guns in the area, making it difficult for the government to deal with runaway insecurity.Read: Defiant bandits drive away 300 animals amid security operationKenya Red Cross was forced to cut short relief operations in the county after its staffs were attacked, only restoring the same on Tuesday amid assurance of improved security.The fights escalated after the killing of Loyamorok MCA Kibet Cheretei and Pepe Kitambaa (Tiaty MP Jubilee hopeful) two weeks ago.The two were shot at close range, sparking protests by residents.More on this: Heartless bandits kill mother, three-day old baby in Baringo North
