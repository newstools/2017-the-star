There are claims that the police are burning Pokot homes and granaries in Operation Dumisha Amani in Baringo.Officially, the special operation is aimed at flushing out bandits from Baringo North and South subcounties.But residents say the cops are torching homes and granaries and demanding bribes.More than 2,000 families have fled Baringo in the face of this operation.Something is seriously wrong somewhere: Dumisha Amani means Restore Peace. Why burn homes and granaries in the name of restoring peace and policing? At the end of the day, these cops are no better than the marauding bandits they say they are dealing with. Burning homes and granaries is thuggery, it is not police standard operating procedure anywhere in the world outside of civil war zones, in which case it is a crime against humanity.County AP commander Robinson Ndiwa denies everything, saying that the police are in hot pursuit of bandits into their hideouts.The truth needs to be unearthed &ndash; speedily.
