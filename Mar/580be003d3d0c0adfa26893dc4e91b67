Kenya are the inaugural world cross country mixed relays champions as the quartet of world champion Asbel Kiprop, Beatrice Chepkoech, Nancy Nzisa and Bernard Kipkorir claimed the title at the Kololo grounds yesterday.Asbel was the anchor-man for Kenya and did what he is mostly known for, front running as he led right after the gun. Asbel opened a sizeable gap half-way through the race but Ethiopian Welde Tufa caught up with him and took the lead.Asbel reacted successfully, hitting the front once more, buoyed by the sizeable number of Kenyan fans in the crowd.With about 200m to go, Asbel increased the pace with a defeated Tufa failing to respond as the Kenyan clocked 5:19, Tufa had 5:23 and Aras Kaya of Turkey (a former Kenyan) came home third in 5:31.He handed the wristband to Nancy Nzisa who raced down the lawn to increase the gap ahead of Ethiopia&rsquo;s Bone Cheluke. Nzisa took advantage of the gap created by Asbel and brought the wristband home in a 6:07 minute cruise over Cheluke&rsquo;s 6:16. The script was always certain in the third set as Kipkorir faced off with a more fancied Yomif Kejelcha. There was no looking back for the Kenyan as he maintained the over 50-minute gap to clock the fastest time of the event at 4:58minutes.Chepkoech had the toughest task of the quartet, to deliver gold for Kenya in line up that had multiple Olympic champion Genzebe Dibaba of Ethiopia.Despite clocking the joint slowest time of the afternoon at 5:58 minutes, Chepkoech did exactly as expected as Kenya hit 22:22 minutes for gold.Ethiopia were second in 22:30 while Turkey, composed of a former Kenyan quartet of Kaya, Maryam Akdag, Ali Kaya and Yasemin Can finishied third in 22:37.&ldquo;I am very happy to be among the pioneers of the mixed relay race and more so to win gold. It will remain in the books of history that Kenya won the inaugural mixed relay gold medal,&rdquo; said Asbel. &ldquo;I am back in cross country, for the second time and lucky enough to have won another gold as a team and I find it an important addition to my profile as an athlete.&rdquo;&ldquo;The shorter course is quite a beauty for me and I will continue doing this for the next five year or so before I decide to upgrade and maybe follow in the footsteps of Eliud Kipchoge.&rdquo;&ldquo;Winning the way we did is a sign of togetherness and that is why you saw us hold hands at the end of the race.&rdquo;He added that the cross is an important build-up heading into the new track season with the World Relays next in line in Bahamas next month and the World Championships in London in August.
