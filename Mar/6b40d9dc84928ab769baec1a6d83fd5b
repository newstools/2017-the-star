Two politicians have asked Wiper to keep the deal signed between ODM leader Raila Odinga and party leader Kalonzo Musyoka out of NASA.They are Lugari MP Ayub Savula and Kakamega Senate hopeful Cleophas Malala. Savula said the persistent demands by Wiper that the deal that is yet to be made public be honoured are misplaced since Cord &ldquo;died&rdquo; and NASA is a new outfit.Savula and Malala said Raila and Kalonzo should disqualify themselves from the NASA race and leave it to either ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi or Ford Kenya&rsquo;s Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula. On Wednesday, National Assembly minority leader Francis Nyenze gave NASA a seven-day ultimatum to name Kalonzo the flagbearer or Wiper will leave NASA and go it alone.&ldquo;If it is not Kalonzo that will be the end of NASA. It [NASA] could change into Nyanza Super Alliance because we will pull out,&rdquo; Nyenze said. The remarks fuelled speculations that NASA could be on the verge of a breakup. But Wiper secretary general Hassan Omar and Machakos Senator Johnson Muthama assured opposition supporters that Kalonzo is in NASA to stay, terming Nyenze&rsquo;s remarks personal.Mudavadi said he could not comment on the agreement between Raila and Kalonzo because he was not party to it and it was not signed under NASA. Mudavadi, last weekend, said NASA supporters threatening not to vote for a candidate who is not from their community are working for Jubilee because NASA&rsquo;s primary goal is to remove President Uhuru Kenyatta from power. Speaking in Kisii town on Thursday, Raila assured opposition supporters that Kalonzo is firmly in NASA. Malala said Wiper leaders are importing excess baggage from Cord to NASA, who are now tired of being threatened.&ldquo;Kalonzo is a lawyer and should tell his people that the pact he signed with Raila died a natural death when NASA was formed.&rdquo;
