More than 2,000 families have fled their homes in insecure Baringo, accusing security officers of using excessive force in their operations.They claimed police burned about 20 houses during operation 'Dumisha Amani', which is aimed at disarming and flushing out armed Pokot bandits who are killing people and animals.Resident Ann Mukoino alleged that officers who torched houses ended up displacing at least 400 people in Mukutani on Sunday.Mukoino also claimed the officers stormed Lonyangai village in Chepkalacha at about 3.30pm and stole livestock."They did not utter a word. This has resulted in the mass movement of innocent and peaceful Pokot locals," she said. "They also stole more than Sh20,000 cash from the homesteads."More than 30,000 Tugen residents have been displaced by the bandits. Fearing for their lives, the people have sought refuge in the neighbouring Laikipia and West Pokot counties.Reached for comment, county AP commander Robinson Ndiwa denied the allegations against police.Ndiwa warned residents against spreading the "rumour" that innocent people have been displaced."Journalists should also desist from propagating lies that could frustrate efforts by security agents pursuing criminals," he told the Star by phone.He said they were pursuing the bandits into their hideouts.The operation took off immediately after DP William Ruto toured the county on Monday.He announced that Baringo North and South were "disturbed" areas and issued a shoot to kill order against the armed bandits.A total of 19 areas in Tiaty subcounty have been gazetted as dangerous and disturbed areasRead: Baringo North, South are declared &lsquo;disturbed&rsquo; for full-scale operationMore on this: Ruto issues shoot-to-kill order after daring bandits disrupt his Baringo visitOn Wednesday, Rift Valley regional coordinator Wanyama Musiambo assured that people's rights would not be violated during the operation."We are only targeting armed bandits who have terrorising residents.
