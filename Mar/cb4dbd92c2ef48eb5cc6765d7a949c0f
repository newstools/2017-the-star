The government has criticised the plan by the opposition to set up a parallel tallying centre during the August 8 election.Speaking at State House, Nakuru, yesterday, spokesman Manoah Esipisu accused the opposition of sustained attacks on the Jubilee administration.He, however, urged Kenyans to support the IEBC as it prepares to conduct and deliver a credible election.Esipisu said there is need to appreciate the good work being done by the electoral agency. &ldquo;We ask all Kenyans to support the IEBC. Anyone who casts doubts on the work of the IEBC cannot claim to be a champion of the new Constitution,&rdquo; he said.He also said the ongoing security operation in Baringo and Laikipia counties will be sustained until normalcy is restored. Esipisu, however, said security agencies will carry out the operation while taking into account the need to uphold human rights values.He did not comment on the claims that the IEBC awarded a tender to a French company that was fined for alleged bribery. The IEBC has awarded the Sh3 billion tender for voter identification and transmission of results to Safran Identity Ltd, after cancelling that of South Africa&rsquo;s Gemalto. It has emerged that a French court had in 2012 fined the company over bribery of public officials to win a contract in 2000-03.Esipisu also dismissed claims by some opposition leaders from the Coast opposed to the government&rsquo;s plan to construct an inland port in Naivasha.He said contrary to claims, the project will enhance operations at the Mombasa Port by reducing the waiting time.&ldquo;Despite the false narrative that the economy is not doing well, Kenya&rsquo;s economic growth has remained resilient and has posted robust growth in 2016,&rdquo; Esipisu said.He also said the government has distributed relief food to three million people and initiated a cash transfer programme. Esipisu said although the overall inflation has shot up above the government&rsquo;s target, the state has put in place measures to tame food inflation.
