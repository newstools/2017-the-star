The Education ministry has directed secondary school principals to provide receipts for funds allocated to students under the Free Day Secondary Education Programme.Under the programme, the ministry pays Sh12,780 for each student in public secondary schools.Speaking to the Star on Saturday, Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang&rsquo;i said schools are expected to issue block receipts for the total amount received.&ldquo;A list signed by each student indicating their official names as they appear in the school register, class, admission number, and amount received should be forwarded by the school principal, with appended signatures, to the ministry headquarters through the subcounty directors of education,&rdquo; a circular spelling out the rules reads.The principals are further required to issue receipts to each student for the amount the school received.Matiang&rsquo;i said receipting students for the capitation funds and displaying the amounts schools receive on institutions&rsquo; noticeboards is required for accountability and transparency.In February, the ministry said Sh15.2 billion will be spent on FDSE to benefit 2,354,786 students in 8,041 public secondary schools.The money pays for tuition and expenses schools incur while providing education to learners in basic education institutions.Matiang&rsquo;i said school administrations should ensure students sleep in a clean and secure environment.
