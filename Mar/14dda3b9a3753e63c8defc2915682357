The licensing standoff between Kenya Revenue Authority and clearing agents is set to take a defining twist this week if the agents make good their threat to paralyse operations from Wednesday.Under their umbrella body, the Kenya International Freight and Warehousing Association, more than 1,200 members gave KRA a seven-day ultimatum to renew their licenses unconditionally or they will be forced to paralyse the sector.The ultimatum was given on last month and is set to end this week.Road, sea and air cargo entry points will be affected by the strike where the taxman could lose up to Sh3 billion.But there is also another angle to the matter, as a case by the KIFWA members against their management board comes up for hearing today at the magistrate&rsquo;s court which had issued restraining orders barring the officials from acting for or on behalf of the association until the matter is heard and determined. Times Tower has maintained it will not renew the agents&rsquo; customs agents licenses for 2017, rolling out a raft of new regulations and fresh vetting procedures that the agents have dismissed as a move by cartels colluding with Commissioner General, John Njiraini, to frustrate small companies and push them out of business.They further accuse customs officials of favoring multi-national firms in fraudulently obtaining exemptions and direct release from treasury as a way from evading tax.The former officials are Auni Bhaiji, Phillip Arunga, Reuben Ndegwa, Eric Gitonga, Francis Omondi have been accused by majority members of working against their interests in agreeing to the new regulations without consulting the members.However, KRA maintains the agents must be vetted by April 1st as part of efforts to clean up the sector that has been riddled with corruption but the agents have held their own that the clean-up has to begin by vetting the customs officials, starting with the commissioner general, who is the chairman of the panel established to vet them. The agents, during their meeting held in Nairobi a fortnight ago, appointed a nine-member task-force chaired by former Nyaribari Chache legislator Chris Bichage which has been pushing for negotiations with KRA in vain. They are accusing Njiraini of conspiring to kill SMEs while protecting multinational companies in which he has interest, especially in securing the lucrative Standard Gauge Railway business.The new requirements are contained in a Stakeholders Bio-Data form which requires agents to disclose crucial information about their business operations and clients.Other data sought to be submitted in the form is the number of employees and whether or not they are paying statutory labour contributions on behalf of those who work for them, like Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE), NHIF and NSSF. KIFWA membership claims the form is not an official KRA document, suggesting it is cartels that authored the &lsquo;illegitimate&rsquo; document in cahoots with customs officials in exchange for favorable treatment by KRA. In the case filed by at least 41 members of KIFWA who had gone to court to seek the orders against the officials.KRA who they want compelled to renew their licenses unconditionally is enjoined. If the court grants the order against KRA, then the sector will breathe a sigh of relief as the boycott will be avoided but that is only a matter of if.According to sections 145 and 149 of the East African Community Customs Management Act and Regulation 150 of the EACCMA Regulations 2006, all validly licensed customs agents are supposed to have valid their licenses automatically renewed annually upon application to KRA subject to the requirements of Form C20.
