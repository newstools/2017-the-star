Airkenya Express, the Wilson Airport-based scheduled and charter flight services, has acquired a $2.5 million (about Sh256.5 million) Airbus AS 350 B3 helicopter in a fleet expansion programme.This is in the wake of growing demand for helicopter scenic flights and safaris in East Africa.The helicopter was delivered by Airbus, South Africa, last Month.Airkenya&rsquo;s general manager Dino Bisleti said the latest helicopter in its fleet will bolster operations, as the airline continues to offer scheduled flights to major game parks and beach resorts in the country.&ldquo;The new helicopter can fly with both doors open offering the ultimate scenic flight for photographers and clientele who wish to experience safaris differently, that is, up-close and personal,&rdquo; Bisleti said in a statement.Airkenya has in the last three years developed helicopters for scenic flight.Bisleti said the new helicopter will serve Airkenya well in &ldquo;the hot and high altitude in which we operate&rdquo;.&ldquo;Whilst the average cost of operating a helicopter in the local market per hour is $2,000 (about Sh205,200 ), the over $2.5 million investment will put Airkenya helicopters in a good stead to offer competitive rates,&rdquo; Bisleti said.
