The proposed amendments to the National Cohesion and Integration Commission Act involve the enhancement of penalties for convicted hate mongers (up to 10 years) and fines for convicted media organisations (up to Sh10 million). The courts rely on Acts of Parliament to mete out penalties. However, the NCIC has never secured a hate speech conviction and fears are going to be widespread that the tougher penalties will only make it harder to nail hatemongers. It will be a tragedy if VIP hatemongers, for instance, continue to be taken to court on plenty of multimedia evidence only to be let off the hook. Haters, whether VIP, lowly or nondescript, should not continue walking free and making a mockery of all the best efforts of the police, the Directorate of Public Prosecutions and the Judiciary. Government needs to get serious about convicting hatemongers. The chances of conviction are easier when the penalties are not so strict.
