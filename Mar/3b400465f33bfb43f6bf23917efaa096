Opposition chief Raila Odinga was yesterday taken ill and rushed to the the Karen Hospital for treatment.Raila, who was diagnosed with food poisoning, was treated and discharged. Reports of his illness, which were downplayed by his spokesman Dennis Onyango as &ldquo;nothing serious&rdquo;, came as a shocker to his supporters.Three weeks ago, Raila's daughter Rosemary Odinga was admitted for what is said to be brain tumour.Rosemary, Raila's most politically active child and aspirant for Kibra MP, was admitted at the Aga Khan and Nairobi hospitals, then later flown to South Africa. "He [Raila] is okay and he is resting at home after being treated for food poisoning. He also went for a check-up, which is a normal thing. He will continue with his activities tomorrow," Onyango told the Star yesterday.However, the ODM leader who is seen as the fulcrum of the National Super Alliance, will miss this year's Fourth Devolution Conference, which he had been invited to close.Instead, Raila will fly to South Africa to visit his ailing daughter, who was moved there on Tuesday last week.The former Prime Minister will be represented at the conference in Naivasha by his NASA co-principal and Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang'ula.Raila has had a series of political engagements since Rosemary was flown abroad, from rallies in Meru, to a visit to Nigeria for the grand opening of his long-time friend Olusegun Obasanjo presidential library. The opposition supremo is known for energetic campaigns that can run into many consecutive days.In 2010, Raila had a brain operation after days of grueling campaigns for the 2010 constitutional referendum.He underwent a procedure to remove fluids that were putting pressure on his brain, his family doctor Oluoch Olunya said then.Its said that Olunya is among those who accompanied Rosemary to South Africa.Others were his mother Ida Odinga and sister Winnie Odinga.
