Machakos Senator Johnson Muthama has criticised the newly formed Wiper Express outfit, saying its members are being used by Jubilee Party to divide Wiper.He spoke at a rally in Machakos town on Monday.The senator said calls by the Wiper Express team to have Kalonzo Musyoka named NASA presidential flagbearer are not genuine.He said their agenda is to have Kalonzo ditch NASA and go to the ballot alone or join Jubilee.&ldquo;If there are people who want to deny this community and Kenyans their deserved victory, they are the ones insisting that Kalonzo must be NASA&rsquo;s presidential candidate,&rdquo; Muthama said.He said if all the other three parties in NASA made similar demands, the unity of the coalition would be at stake.&ldquo;People should understand that all the four NASA principals have a following and if each side comes with the same demands the coalition will be torn apart,&rdquo; he said.Muthama was with Kitui Senator David Musila, MPs Makali Mulu (Kitui Central) and Mutua Muluvi (Kitui East) among a host of Machakos MCAs. He accused Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana of being behind the Wiper Express outfit.He told Kivutha to go slow on Wiper Party matters as he is only a newcomer and has nothing to show as having fought for the party.&ldquo;Even if our party leader entered into an agreement with Kivutha, let him go slow on some Wiper issues. In any case, he has been an enemy to the party before some of us sacrificed a lot to build it,&rdquo; Muthama said.His sentiments were dismissed by Wiper National Organising secretary Robert Mbui, who asked Muthama to leave Kivutha alone.Mbui is a member of the Wiper Express team. He dismissed Muthama&rsquo;s claims that the outfit is a Jubilee affair.Mbui added that they are only doing what Muthama has failed to do, and that is to defend Kalonzo. &ldquo;As a party we nominated Muthama to go and represent Wiper&rsquo;s affairs in the committee responsible for picking the NASA presidential candidate, but when he went there he started saying other things. We are only doing what he has been unable to do,&rdquo; he said.Mbui said Muthama&rsquo;s attack on Kivutha is confirmation that he has been dishonest with his calls to have all small parties fold up and join Wiper.&ldquo;If Muthama was honest with his calls to have all other party leaders join Wiper, why then is he now fighting Kivutha, yet Kivutha has already joined Wiper?&rdquo; he said.
