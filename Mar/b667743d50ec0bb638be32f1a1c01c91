Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong yesterday said he will not quit ODM if he loses the nominations, as claimed by Funyula MP Paul Otuoma.He said it is the likes of Otuoma who cannot be trusted since he quit the party once before he returned "through the window"."My faith in ODM is beyond reproach. Being a seasoned politician for 25 years is no mean achievement . The role of my opponent is to try and malign me to the Teso community forgetting that I am a cosmopolitan leader," Ojaamong said.Otuoma has expressed his interest in the governor seat. Ojaamong said, "I am ready to face Otuoma in the primaries with Kizito Wangalwa as my running mate. Irrespective of the outcome I will remain loyal to the party contrary to the imaginations of my opponent."Otuoma criticised the governor for poor leadership. He said Ojaamong has done nothing for the people of Busia."Ojaamong, I want to tell you openly that you have been an embarrassment to the people of Busia. You have been mentioned [many times] in corruption-related cases and you even risk being locked out of this year's general election," Otuoma said.
