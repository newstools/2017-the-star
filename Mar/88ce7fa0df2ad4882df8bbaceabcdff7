Wiper is set to end the feud between Mombasa governor hopefuls — Senator Hassan Omar and Nyali MP Hezron Awiti — when it holds nomination on Saturday in Nairobi. Party leader Kalonzo Musyoka on Wednesday said 600 delegates will be involved. By 12pm yesterday, Wiper officials, including the two aspirants, were still locked up in a meeting in Nairobi, discussing how the primaries will be conducted. Dispute and confusion over the list of delegates remains unresolved. There have been fears the primaries will not be free and fare. But Kalonzo assured it will be credible and transparent. Awiti said he is ready for the nomination and no one will rig him out. “We will issue a press conference when we land in Mombasa,” he said on the phone. Calls to Omar went unanswered. He did not also respond to a text message sent to him. Omar, as Wiper secretary general, is authorised to sign nomination certificates. Critics view this as a conflict of interest. There had been suggestions of joint nominations by the NASA National Coordinating Committee, but these were shelved when the hopefuls supported Wiper’s internal process. Both Omar and Awiti say they havewhat it takes to defeat incumbent Hassan Joho. Omar’s camp boasts of vocal support by MCAs and residents. Awiti’s team stakes claim on higher voters numbers, but adds it has the resources to conduct multimillion-shilling campaigns. The loser, in the primaries, can accept results or defect. The High Court last month suspended implementation of a law that tames politicians from party hopping in the run-up to the polls. This stands until a case filed by the Council of Governors is concluded.
