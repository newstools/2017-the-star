Three houses were burned down at Sosian Ranch in Nanyuki following invasion by herders seeking to displace owners of the property from their homes.Two houses belonging to the conservancy's directors were razed on Thursday while the third one owned by a rancher was set ablaze on Friday morning.A fierce shoot-out ensued between guards at the ranch and the heavily armed raiders at the time of the attack.The violent invaders have disrupted business, especially tourism, in Nanyuki as well as in most parts of Laikipia county.Fifteen Australian tourists had to be evacuated from the area using a helicopter following an attack in early February.The Thursday and Friday incidents are the latest in a string of arson attacks, murders, farm invasions and rampant stock theft that have spun the area out of control.The ranchers feel that the state has neglected them, coming in the face of being left out in the recent declaration of areas in Baringo as 'disturbed and dangerous'.Read: State gazettes 19 'disturbed and dangerous' areas in BaringoThe On February 19, armed herders raided the 24,000-acre conservancy and outnumbered 15 police officers who attempted to drive them out of the area.Large numbers of Pokot and Samburu moved into Sosian having nearly run down and exhausted pasture at the 44,000-acre Suyian conservancy.The conservancy directors say the Pokots at least only graze their animals but the Samburus have gone a step further to vandalise property.More on this: Samburu building permanent boma on Suyian ranchLaikipia North MP Matthew Lempurkel's meetings with the pastoralists have borne no fruit as the attacks are yet to dissipate.Sosian Ranch had been by 2001 abandoned after the land became so degraded that it could not support the pastoralists need for grass for their animals.Six shareholders came together to restore the ranch with combined ranching and wildlife conservancy.At least 100 workers from the local community are employed at the facility which may be totally run down unless the state acts, one of the directors told the Star on Friday.Read: Herders invade Suyian ranch and burn lodge
