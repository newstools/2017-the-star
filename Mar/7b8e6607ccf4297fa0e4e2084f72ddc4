A fierce fire spread by strong winds has consumed more than 50 acres of Gikohi forest in Kinale, Lari constituency, in three days.People living around the forest have been battling the flames to prevent the blaze from reaching their homes or Kinale Forest.Kiambu ecosystem conservator George Njenga said they are treating the fire as arson. He said the forest is only visited by women fetching firewood, young men who graze sheep and cows and Kenya Forest Service guards.Njenga said trees had been harvested in the area the fire destroyed. &ldquo;The fire was set up by people with ill motives. We suspect it was started in three separate positions,&rdquo; he said.Residents say the fire started on Saturday. They saw smoke and rushed to check what was going on. They moved their cattle from the forest and reported the incident to the KFS.Community forest association member Robert Mugo said two firefighters from the Kiambu government were unable to put out the fire as the water from their little tanker was insufficient. &ldquo;These firefighters carry little water to contain such huge fires. They fetched water at Gatamaiyu and Bathi dams, but the fire was too much,&rdquo; he said.Gikohi Forest neighbours Kinale Forest and they both join at Kamae Forest, which is the foot of the big Aberdare Forest to the South.
