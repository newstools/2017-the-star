Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga is a man under siege in his reelection bid amid simmering differences with politicians who supported him in 2013. They helped Rasanga garner more than 160,000 votes against his fierce critic and challenger William Oduol, who got 64, 000 votes on the little known National Agenda Party of Kenya (NAPK) ticket. Oduol has since decamped to ODM and warned Rasanga to brace for a fierce mother of all battles in the Augsut poll.Five elected leaders among them Siaya Senator James Orengo, MPs Jakoyo Midiwo (Gem), Dave Ochieng (Ugenya), Gideon Ochanda (Bondo) and Nicholas Gumbo (Rarieda) have openly retracted their support for Rasanga. The combined team of the Siaya leaders bankrolled and campaigned for Rasanga, who was then a political green horn from the public service to become governor. Siaya Woman rep Christine Ombaka is playing her cards close to her chest, not to be seen endearing herself to Rasanga. She might throw her weight behind another aspirant. Currently, Rasanga has the support of Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi, who is also facing a similar stiff challenge from politician Otieno Alur perceived to be Orengo and Midiwo&rsquo;s project. Nominated MP Oburu Oginga, who has been an ardent supporter of Rasanga is said to have expressed his reservations about the incumbent, after the governor allegedly backed his rival team. Political pundits claim that Wandayi, who has vowed not to relent in supporting Rasanga, does not impress Orengo and Midiwo.&ldquo;How will he manage to win the hearts of the electorates in the five constituencies without their elected leader&rsquo;s endorsement,&rdquo; Jim Achich, a former Siaya ODM youth leader, asks.The fallout comes in the wake of perceived strained relations with Cord leader Raila Odinga&rsquo;s family. This is after Peter Odima retracted his support for Rasanga. Odima is the second family member, after Midiwo, to disassociate himself from Rasanga&rsquo;s re election campaign. Midiwo cited poor leadership and runaway corruption in Rasanga&rsquo;s administration as a reason why he opted out. The elder who has immense influence in the larger Kakan family, where Rasanga comes from, accused the governor of engaging in underhand dealings with the family&rsquo;s political rivals. Odima claimed Rasanga has been supporting the rival Jo Ka nyasmwa clan from Bondo, who are against MP Oburu&rsquo;s bid for Bondo parliamentary seat. The clan is backing the re election of the incumbent MP Gideon Ochanda.Rasanga has on numerous occasions been seen attending and funding the rival groups meeting, led by Mwai Andiwo, yet it is Oburu who helped him become governor,&rdquo; Odima said.&ldquo;We may decide to support Oduol for governor since he also hails from the Alego community together with Rasanga,&rdquo; Odima said.Midiwo has since made public his support for Gumbo and Oduol bids for Siaya governor seat.Odima took a swipe at the Alego\Usonga ODM branch chairman Orwenjo Umidha saying the former Siaya mayor was part of self seekers out to enrich their selfish interest in the guise of supporting Rasanga&rsquo;s reelection bid.His sentiments come barely a few days after elders, led by chairman Nicholas Nyadiang&rsquo;a representing members of Kakan , the largest clan in Alego/Usonga constituency, resolved to unite. Speaking during the meeting at a hotel in Siaya town, they agreed to unanimously rally behind Governor Rasanga.Rasanga has, however, told his two warring sides of the uncles from Kakan clan that it was not the right time to engage in divisive politics.He warned that the continued division among them is an affront towards NASA principal Raila Odinga&rsquo;s chances of becoming the outfits presidential torch bearer.&ldquo;The perceived squabbles among my uncles are not good for Raila&rsquo;s candidacy, mine and that of his brother Oburu, who is seeking for Bondo parliamentary seat,&rdquo;Rasanga.He said the county has provided tractors, which were available at a subsidised fee, and his warring uncles should seize the opportunity and use them to cultivate and produce a surplus harvest for the future.His administration purchased more than 50 tractors to be used in farming through a subsidised fee of Sh2,500 to enhance food security in the county.The governor said the perceived disagreements should be discussed instead of tearing at each other in the public.Rasanga is anchoring his reelection bid on Alego/Usonga constituency&rsquo;s vote bloc, from where he will start seeking votes from the the swing constituencies, irrespective of his relationship with their elected leaders.The governor has installed solar power lights in virtually every market centres in the six subcounties and tarmacking of more than16 km road within the towns. Critics argue the projects are funded by the national government in collaboration with the World Bank.Rasanga's administration has been accused of failing to revamp the collapsed cotton farming, which was a major cash crop earner in the region. He has constructed over 100 ECDE centres across the county and recruited teachers.However, the skewed employment of county employees has resulted in a backlash from leaders, especially in Ugenya, since no executive position has been allocated for them.Governor Rasanga faces abuse of office charges for allegedly buying family members, politicians and relatives air tickets, according to the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission. The governor, who exuded confidence of winning the case, said the law states that an individual remains innocent until proven guilty adding that he will contest in the next polls. This was in reports that the EACC may bar governors facing corruption charges from contesting in August polls.The governor was mentioned alongside Mwangi Wairia (Murang&rsquo;a), Aden Nadhif (Garissa), Sospeter Ojamong (Busia), Evans Kidero (Nairobi) Alfred Mutua (Machakos) and Godana Doyo (Isiolo) as politicians likely to be barred from contesting for elective posts over corruption claims.Rasanga added that he would use the lapse in the judicial process to ensure that his name appears in the ballot box in the forthcoming general elections.He claimed that the Kenyan judicial system can only be used to bar a candidate from contesting only if he has been convicted and jailed for more than one year prior to the elections.Rasanga added that with the general elections a few months away, the law will not be applicable in blocking them from seeking political offices.&ldquo;Between now and August I do not think it is possible to convict us because the time is even less,&rdquo; added Rasanga.With the latest development, Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo and politician William Oduol have since broken ranks hardly three months after they agreed to team up to oust Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga.The move viewed to lead to the leaders to retreat to a drawing board is viewed by many that it might tilt the way voters will cast their votes.The duo&rsquo;s silent memorandum agreed with Rarieda MP Nicholas Gumbo to work together has hit a snag after Oduol and Midiwo cited betrayal.In December last year,Oduol and Rarieda MP Nicholas Gumbo who are both eying the Siaya gubernatorial seat came together with Jakoyo Midiwo as the mastermind of the alliance, to dethrone Governor Rasanga.The two had vowed to support either of them who shall have clinched the ODM party ticket, with a common goal of sending Rasanga home due to what they termed as poor leadership and mismanagement of public funds.In a twist of events, Midiwo who endorsed the Gumbo-Oduol partnership and promised to either triumph or fail with them has now turned against businessman Oduol accusing of him of betraying their course.Midiwo speaking at Ndere village in his Gem constituency, claimed that even after walking together in several occasions and vowing to work together with a common agenda of changing Siaya County leadership, Oduol turned against the will and started singing a different tune.He accused Oduol of having announced that he (Oduol) is now a lone ranger in the race dampening their spirit of collectiveness to hound Rasanga out of office.The National assembly deputy minority leader,said Oduol allegedly announced that he would support governor Rasanga&rsquo;s re-election in case he fails to win the ODM party primaries.Oduol however dismissed Midiwo&rsquo;s claims as sheer propaganda well coined to divert the attention of his supporters&rsquo; ahead of the ODM party primaries. The politician admitted that they were in talks with Gumbo through Midiwo on how to remove Rasanga only to realize that it was skewed towards their own benefit and not that of Siaya residents.&ldquo;I realize that the talks were aimed at finding avenues of how to enrich ourselves after clinching power and not for the good of Siaya residents,&rdquo; added Oduol hence his decision to jump ship.Oduol, who was speaking at a separate function at Umina village in Ugunja constituency on Saturday, stated that he opted to pull out after realizing that partnership was aimed at advancing selfish interests.He stated that as a person he welcomes guided democracy but maintained that Midiwo cannot convene a meeting of only two leaders and claim to be finding a way of shaping the destiny of Siaya County.Oduol added that if Midiwo was wise in his zeal to change the future leadership of Siaya County, he ought to have engaged other elected leaders as well.He cited Siaya Senator James Orengo who is a senior politician in the region, Oburu Oginga) Nominated),Dave Ochieng(Ugenya),Omondi Muluan(Alego/Usonga) among others.Oduol claimed that he would not be hoodwinked and betrayed again by Midiwo who in 2013 reneged from an earlier agreement to market him as the potential governor aspirant.&ldquo;It is Midiwo who came up with propaganda that I beat up my wife to death yet he had earlier introduced me and even campaigned for me before shifting allegiance to Rasanga,&rdquo;added Oduol.He exuded confidence of dethroning Rasanga in the party primaries saying he did the same while in a little known NAPK party while this time he was contesting on an ODM ticket.The other governor aspirant in the race is former Regional Development PS Carey Orege from Bondo and a cousin of Raila.Orege is said to enjoy a soft spot from Raila whom they have worked closely with since the advent of the multi party politics led by the late doyen of opposition politics Jaramogi Oginga Odinga.Orege has also worked closely with Raila when he(Raila) was the minister for roads hence initiating many tarmac roads in both Bondo and Rarieda constituencies.The former PS who is also vying on an ODM ticket, has denied claims of being the preferred candidate for ODM nominations saying he has offered his candidature out of resolve.
