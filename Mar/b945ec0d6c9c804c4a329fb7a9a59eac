A judiciary auctioneer was on Monday charged in a Kwale court with stealing Sh500,000 from a lawyer. Joel Muasya (pictured) is accused of stealing from George Mungai, a former state prosecutor. He denied the charges before Kwale senior resident magistrate Betty Koech. Muasya allegedly committed the offence on February 15 at Umbi Plaza in Kwale county. He was Kamau&rsquo;s agent. The court was told Muasya was entrusted with property worth Sh500,000 to deliver to Kamau. Muasya&rsquo;s lawyer Jack Matheka objected to his client taking a plea, but state prosecutor Timothy Musyoki said they were following the law in prosecuting Muasya. &ldquo;The accused stole the money as an agent, so the case is prosecutable and we are within the law,&rdquo; he said. Koech ordered Muasya to pay Sh1 million bond or Sh200,000 bail to secure his release. The mention was set for March 29 and the hearing for April 24.
