City Hall has assured Nairobi residents it will not increase taxes and levies, despite the county budget swelling by Sh1.5 billion.Finance executive Gregory Mwakanongo on Monday said the county will instead revise the valuation roll and re-evaluate underperforming revenue streams to fund the Sh35.9 billion 2017-18 budget.The Ratings and Valuation Roll Bill has been pending in the county assembly since last year. If passed, all property will be revalued.Currently, the city uses the valuation roll developed in 1983 which requires property owners to pay Sh100,000 per acre of undeveloped land.&ldquo;We will not be overburdening you further. We will not revise any rates upwards,&rdquo; Mwakanongo said during a public participation forum at Charter Hall. There were concerns, especially among the business community and property owners, the county government would increase taxes.The budget has increased from Sh34.4 billion to Sh35.9 billion. About Sh24.1 billion will be used on recurrent expenditure and Sh11.7 billion will go towards development. The transport sector has been allocated the lion&rsquo;s share of the development fund &mdash; Sh4.9 billion. Head of budget James Ngunjiri said the money will be used to complete infrastructure projects that have stalled since 2013.A report released by the Budget and Appropriations committee early last year showed 181 projects have stalled for lack of funds.Ngunjiri said the county will complete the construction and maintenance of 1,330km of road, drains and bridges. It will also build 4,500km of non-motorised public transport and instal 2,320 streetlights.The health sector has been allocated Sh1.2 billion for development. This includes Sh484 million to bu ydrugs and Sh800 million to rehabilitate of health centres.
