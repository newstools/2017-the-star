Former Uriri MP Ojwang' Omollo died at Nairobi hospital on Thursday morning.Omollo's cousin Josie Ayieko told the Star that he had been receiving treatment at the hospital for two weeks.Current MP John Kobado condoled with the family, terming the death a big blow to the constituency."He was a very likable politician. Despite losing in the last poll, he supported my leadership and never undermined me," he said.Omollo garnered 12,875 votes against Kobado's 21,795 in the 2013 general election.He got off the political limelight until a year ago when he began campaigns for re-election on an ODM ticket in the August 8 election.Godfrey Odiwuor, a former councillor, said the former MP was a close ally who transformed Uriri's education sector.He said the former legislator built a water system at Uriri High School and helped start Anding'o and Piny Owacho Secondary Schools."Before the project, students used to draw water from a nearby open pit dam, which was dangerous. He was a gentleman who took care of his supporters when in power," Odiwour said.Sony Sugar MD Jane Pamela described Omollo as a dedicated board member who served the company diligently.
