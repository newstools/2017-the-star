Daystar University has closed its Nairobi and Athi River campuses indefinitely after student protests over poor meals and facilities. Vice chancellor Timothy Wachira also said the student government has been suspended. "The decision was arrived today following the disruption of studies by students that took place since Thursday (November 16, 2017), and refusal by Student Government to enter into any dialogue over this matter with Senate, Management and Council," he said in a statement on Friday. The notice also asked undergraduate and diploma students to vacate the premises immediately. Students staged peaceful demonstrations on Thursday saying they are served poor meals. They accused the institution of giving them rice and ugali all through and said the meals are sometimes stale. The learners at Athi River and Valley Road campuses also complained against the administration's decision to increase tuition. Protesters added thatÂ over the years, fees have been increased without proper notification and amid deteriorating services. They noted they pay millions of shillings to earn degrees yet the management is taking them for granted. "With the millions we are paying, we are forced to use broken hostels and other facilities exposing our lives to danger." The learners said they have been raising the issues since 2011 yet the vice chancellor claims he cannot be questioned. Wachira said, however, that postgraduate students will continue with their programmes. More on this: [VIDEO] Daystar students protest poor meals, facilities despite paying 'millions'
