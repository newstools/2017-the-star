Former US President Barack Obama, UN boss AntÃ³nio Guterres and a host of heads of state have been invited to the swearing-in ceremony of President-elect Uhuru Kenyatta. Uhuru wants to use the ceremony set for next Tuesday to show he has support locally and abroad. Malta’s Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, in his capacity as the Commonwealth chairperson, is also among those who have been invited.

The source said the guests will stream into the country from Monday morning. The event will be at Kasarani Stadium, Nairobi. “A blanket invitation has been sent out to all heads of State from Africa and other parts of the world. As of now, it’s difficult to tell who will attend, but as a tradition, most of those under the AU will be present,” the source said. Upon arrival at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, the heads of states will inspect a guard of honour before being driven to State House for lunch. Since Monday when the Supreme Court upheld Uhuru’s October rerun victory, a sub-committee in charge of security, protocol and logistics has been working round the clock to ensure all preparations are complete by Saturday.  Addressing journalists after touring Kasarani Stadium, Joseph Irungu, who chairs the sub-committee, said many diplomats and heads of states across the globe are expected. “It is a little early to come to who exactly will attend, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is handling the invitation,” Irungu, who is also the Administrative Secretary in the Ministry of Interior, said. He said hundreds of thousands of Kenyans are expected to attend, but the stadium can only host 60,000 people.  The rest will watch from outside on mounted screens, he added. The sub-committee is under the Committee of the Assumption of the Office of the President, which is chaired by Head of Public Service and  Secretary to the Cabinet Joseph Kinyua. The Constitution demands the swearing-in takes place seven days following the day the apex court renders its decision. It says the ceremony must be in public before the Chief Justice or the DCJ in the absence of the CJ. Apart from Kinyua, the 22-member committee also has the Attorney-General, the CS in charge of registration of persons and immigration, Interior CS, and CSs for Finance, Foreign Affairs, ICT, Constitutional Affairs, Devolution, and Culture and Social Services.
