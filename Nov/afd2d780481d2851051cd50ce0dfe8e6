Kabuchai MP James Lusweti has asked Luhya leaders to stop "washing each others dirty linen in public". He said this is shaming the community. Lusweti said he has been irked by the continuous attacks and insults by a section of Luhya leaders drawn from the Jubilee camp. "All of us have done wrong things and no one is a saint, but talking about each other in public is total nonsense. It is just exposing our nakedness to other communities who will end up making us their laughing stock," the MP said. He said campaigns are long-gone and it is time leaders come together to develop the region, despite their political affiliations. Lusweti said for Western region to move forward, the leaders must stop maligning each others names. "Leaders from this region should love each other and put a solid love foundation in our politics," he said. Lusweti said NASA co-principal and Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang'ula deserves respect from the community leaders and residents. He urged residents to support NASA in "fighting for the liberation of this country’s leadership", which he said has "gone to the dogs". Lusweti was addressing residents on Friday at Chwele market in his constituency during the launch of a Sh5.6 million toilets and bathrooms construction. The project was funded by the Nzoia Water Services Company in partnership with the Water Services Trust Fund. The money will help build 100 modern bathroom and toilet units at Chwele market. The market is the second largest open air market in East and Central Africa. The project will help prevent disease brought about by poor hygiene. Present were Water CS Eugene Wamalwa, Water Services Trust Fund manager Musikari Kombo, Kimilili MP Didimus Baraza, Bungoma Deputy Governor Charles Ng’ome and Trans Nzoia speaker Joash Werunga.
