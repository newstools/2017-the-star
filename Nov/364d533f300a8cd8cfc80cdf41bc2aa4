Kitui county government and the South Eastern Kenya University are partnering to fight deforestation. Deputy Governor Wathe Nzau (watering a tree) said the county government will prioritise environmental conservation. It will aim for 10 per cent cover, which is an international minimum. Nzau was speaking at Seku on Wednesday when he launched the initiative Growing Trees for Socio-Economic Development to Transform Lives. He was joined by Seku Vice Chancellor Prof Geoffrey Muluvi and Kitui executive for Environment John Makau.
