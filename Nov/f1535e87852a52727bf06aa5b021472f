Police officers on Monday ferried Form Four candidates to their exam centres at Kenyatta Girls’ Secondary school after roads leading to the school were flooded. Heavy rains that have continued to pound the area have flooded the school, making it difficult for the students to access their exam rooms. Led by Thika West deputy county commissioner Tom Anjere, the officers ferried the 152 girls and invigilators in police vans. Anjere said the administration will cooperate with the area leadership to ensure every candidate sits their exams without hitches. “We will do everything in our capacity to ensure the candidates continue with their examinations smoothly,” Anjere said. The administrator, however, urged local leaders to ensure the issue of flooding, especially in the schools, is looked at to avoid causing such inconveniences to students in the future. “Proper drainage systems are needed so that this flooding does not recur,” he said. Anjere was flanked by Thika West deputy director of education Ronald Mbogo, Thika West deputy police boss Bernard Ayoo and deputy AP boss Peter Nzimbi. The floods have hit various estates in Thika, among them Umoja, Kamenu, Makongeni, Kiganjo and Landless, wreacking havoc in the area. The flooding was blamed on a perimeter wall put up by a private developer, who is accused of grabbing land and which had blocked drainage systems. Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu joined Umoja Estate residents in demolishing the wall. Waititu said it was unfortunate for “ and unscrupulous individual to put up the wall without putting in mind the welfare of the poor locals living in Umoja and Matharao Estates.”  “We won’t allow selfish individuals to cause such pain to our people. This is uncalled for and action will be taken,” he said.
