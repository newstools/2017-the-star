The National Police Service should allow opposition leaders Raila Odinga and Kalonzo Musyoka their procession from JKIA to their welcome home rally in Kamukunji. There have been homecoming welcomes at Kenya’s main airport since at least 1961, when the colonial government was still in office. The parties to the Lancaster House series of talks on Independence from 1961 to 1962 were allowed to see off and welcome their leaders at the Embakasi Airport. The colonial police provided security for these comings and goings and none were banned. On May 2 1992, Kenneth Matiba returned to Kenya after being hospitalised in London and was met at JKIA by scores of thousands. There were no uniformed police in sight. When President Uhuru Kenyatta returned home from the ICC in October 2014 he had a seven-hour journey to his office from JKIA, with stopovers and speeches at designated points. The police will be overzealous if they prevent today’s JKIA procession and make the government look weak and the two leaders bigger than ever before.
