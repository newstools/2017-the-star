Some laws in the Constitution have become obsolete, the National Council of Churches of Kenya has said. NCCK secretary general Peter Karanja Wednesday maintained that the Constitution should be amended to get rid of laws that no longer promote the welfare of the nation. He however urged Kenyans to continue respecting the obsolete laws until changes are made. “Disregard of these laws is what leads to breakdown of society and suffering of many people,” Karanja said. He urged leaders to quickly amend the laws for the sake of peace. He spoke at a conference in Limuru on Wednesday. NCCK had previously called for an expanded Executive to include the post of Prime Minister and two deputies. Karanja said political problems cannot be solved by just free and fair elections. “We need inclusivity,” Karanja said. He told MPs to consider the church’s proposal. “We once again reiterate that we are not asking for a nusu mkate government,” Karanja said.
