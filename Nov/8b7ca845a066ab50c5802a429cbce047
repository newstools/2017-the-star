Kilifi MCAs on Monday evening passed a motion for the establishment of a People’s Assembly. The MCAs said the idea of a People’s Assembly is not political, but meant to push for justice. However, yesterday, the High Court in Kitui issued orders barring county assemblies from passing or implementing NASA’s motions on the formation of the People’s Assembly. Justice Lilian Mutende issued the order pending determination of a case filed by a lobby group, Counties Development Group.  The hearing of the case was set for January 2018.  In Kilifi, the People’s Assembly motion was moved by the Leader of Majority and Shella MCA Adamson Kadenge. He termed the August 8 and October 26 presidential elections all invalid, null and void.
