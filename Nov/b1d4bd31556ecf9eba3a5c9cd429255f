Mombasa Health executive Hazel Koitaba yesterday ordered all illegal food kiosks closed. Two people have died of cholera and 25 other cases have been reported. Eighty cases of diarrhoea have also been reported. Addressing journalists at the Public Health Department offices in Mombasa, the CEC said the county government is doing everything to control the disease. “People bringing patients to hospitals should ensure that their vehicles are sanitized,” she said. Koitaba said two patients in Kwale and Kilifi had been hospitalised with cholera symptoms.  She said the first case was reported on October 19. The patients have been isolated at the Majengo, Port Reitz and Utange health facilities.
