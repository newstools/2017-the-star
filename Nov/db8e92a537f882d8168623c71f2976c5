Singer Akothee's daughter Celly Rue Brown was recently unveiled as the new face of Nivea. Celly, who is a student at Strathmore University, was nominated alongside other students and she emerged the top with the most votes. Some social media users claimed that the selection was unfair and that Akothee's daughter didn't deserve the win. Others went overboard and said that she wasn't pretty enough to bag the role. Well, Akothee's daughter responded to the naysayers. "I see no harm in a mother supporting her daughter's dream..if she doesn't support me, then who will?" she posted on Instagram. Adding, "She's my mother and I appreciate and that will never change. Whether she runs mad today she will still be my MOTHER, Akothee I LOVE YOU. You're my strength ."
