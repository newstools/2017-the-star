Kilifi county is united under Governor Amason Kingi more than ever, Kilifi North MP Owen Baya said yesterday. He was reacting to claims by Mining CS Dan Kazungu that Kingi’s (pictured) call for secession of the Coast region has left the county divided. JP leaders are hell-bent on creating rifts by trying to drag residents to their unpopular party, he added. He said their unity was evident when residents overwhelmingly voted for NASA principal Raila Odinga on August 8 following massive campaigns by Kingi. “Had we been divided, Jubilee would have carried the day. That did not happen and our people listened to our voice and did what the governor wanted. That’s what we call unity. Even in last week’s rerun, a few people came out to vote,” Baya said, urging Kazungu to return to NASA “where you belong”.
