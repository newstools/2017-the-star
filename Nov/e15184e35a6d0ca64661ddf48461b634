Tobiko said the culprits should be arraigned under the relevant provision of the penal code adding, "please expedite." Opposition leader Raila Odinga has personally apologised to journalists
attacked by "uninvited" supporters at Wiper Party's office on Tuesday. "I have apologised to Gachuri who was
molested by some rowdy youth who were not invited to the meeting. I have
spoken to [Royal Media CEO] Wachira Waruru and apologised to him," he
said. Editors condemned the assault and asked NASA to identify and hand over to police those who attacked the journalists. "It
is deeply troubling that such an attack could take place within a
supposed secured compound of a party headquarters and in the presence of
some party officials," Kenya Editors Guild chair Linus Kaikai said in a statement on Tuesday. "This was a criminal act and NASA must demonstrate its commitment to the
rule of law by producing to the police the perpetrators of this
incident," he added. Also read: Raila apologises to attacked journalists, Mucheru pledges protection
