Two people were injured on Saturday after an LCD screen set up for the public to follow proceedings at Bishop Cornelius Korir's burial fell on them. It crushed on a section of the crowd a few meters from where DP William Ruto and some bishops were waiting to receive President Uhuru Kenyatta. Strong winds pushed the large screen which was hoisted on huge metal beams. The injured, who are among the orderlies at the event, were rushed to Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital.  There was a stampede as officials and Red Cross workers rushed to save the injured who were trapped under the heavy metals. Read: Thousands gather in Eldoret for Bishop Cornelius Korir's burial Â
