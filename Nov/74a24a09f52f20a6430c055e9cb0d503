Matayos MP Geoffrey Odanga has urged security officers and the DCI to produce in court suspects who were arrested in connection with election-related violence. He said the law states that suspects should not be held in police cells for more than 48 hours without being taken to court. The MP said the government has violated the law. He said if evidence cannot be produced against the suspects, then they should be released immediately. Odanga, who was arrested on Friday evening and held at the Busia police cells for two hours over allegations he sponsored youths to disrupt the repeat presidential election process, spoke when he was summoned at the Busia police station on Monday. Odanga said security officers interrogated him for more than one hour, but found him not guilty. He assured his supporters he will still heed to NASA Raila Odinga’s call when called to conduct peaceful demonstrations. “We need changes at the IEBC and cancellation of the results of the repeat polls conducted on October 26,” Odangatold his supporters. More than 100 supporters, who had accompanied him, said they are behind Raila and vowed to oblige to his call. “President-elect Uhuru Kenyatta should agree to meet with Raila. last Thursday's repeat election was a sham,” supporter George Wanjala said. Odanga also urged Busia police to investigate cases where criminals allied to a "certain politician" have been raiding homes in Marachi area and attacking peopl with pangas. “They are well-known to us. We have already submitted their names at the DCI in Busia. They have repeatedly harmed our people and it hurts us seeing them walk free,” Odanga said.  “Let justice be served equally.”
