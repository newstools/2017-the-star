Lady luck has smiled at Enock Ogega, 30, making him Betin's third winner of the Sh20 million jackpot. The concrete engineer, who has been betting since June 2016, won the millions after placing a bet of Sh99. "I felt like betting and won at the first try. Since then, I have not stopped. There have been many losses and a few wins. This mega win shows that if you keep on trying, you will make it one day," he said. He is a football fan and a die-hard supporter of Manchester United. Betin managing director Leandro Giovando said: "Following our most recent announcement of 24-year-old Evalyne Karaba’s win, we have seen an increase in participation in our Jackpot category and are pleased to have a third winner within such a short period." Karaba, an office assistant, had played for three months when she placed a bet of Sh399. All her 13 predictions were correct. She asked Kenyans to continue betting as they could win but to live within their limits.
