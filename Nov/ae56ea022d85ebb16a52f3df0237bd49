The hearing of a petition by former Yatta MP Francis
Mwangangi, who is challenging the election of MP Charles Kilonzo, started in a
Machakos court yesterday.  The court dismissed an application by Kilonzo's
lawyers to have the petition struck out.  Mwangangi said his agents were denied access to polling stations in
a "conspiracy" that led to his loss. He said his agents are not involved in the counting
of votes and did not sign the forms containing the results.  Mwangangi said some forms were neither
signed nor stamped and the presiding officers did not give reasons
why the agents failed to sign.  He told the court that 87 of the 169 polling
stations in the constituency had irregularities.
