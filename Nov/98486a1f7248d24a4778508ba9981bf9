Kenya needs at least Sh13.4 billion to test and treat children with pneumonia aged five years and below in the next two years. The money will also cover the cost of manufacturing new child-friendly medicine to be used as the first line of treatment in children diagnosed with the disease. Speaking yesterday during the launch of the Amoxycillin Dispersible tablets, Health CS Cleopa Mailu called on other health stakeholders to work together to reduce newborn deaths as well as achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.  “Investing in newborn babies, children and adolescents’ health services is indeed a game changer. Strategic partnerships in dealing with pneumonia in children under five between the public and private sector and other stakeholders is crucial in dealing with the health issues,” Mailu said. Head of the family health unit in the Ministry of Health Mohammed Sheikh said counties play a critical role in strengthening and implementing the management of sick children by use of the national standards and guidelines. “Since we did not meet the millennium development goals, we must know that resources alone cannot reduce these deaths, but we need the right interventions by partnering with various stakeholders to win the fight,” Mohammed said. “Use of optimum treatments like oral antibiotics for the management of pneumonia, injectable antibiotics and oxygen for the management of severe pneumonia should be scaled up to reach all sick children and prevent unnecessary deaths,” Mailu said. Close to 68,000 babies in Kenya do not celebrate their fifth birthdays because they die of pneumonia and malaria. Paediatrician and epidemiologist Ambrose Agweyu said the country needs to invest not only in medication, but also in equipping hospitals with a pulse – oximetry machine which is used in refining pneumonia diagnosis by being able to accurately determine the type of intervention to apply.
