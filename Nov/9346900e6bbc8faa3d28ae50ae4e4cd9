Early one morning, we interrupted a rhino while it was enjoying a delightful mudbath. No doubt the sound of the car engine caused the rhino to decide to get up suddenly and move away.  As this magnificent creature emerged from the mud bath, it was a dark, wet, shiny brown and appeared to look like it could have been made of chocolate ( Perhaps dark Lindt). However, in reality, it was a black rhino. There is often some confusion, with some people regarding the fact that we refer to the two African rhino species as white and black. White rhino are different from Black rhino in a number of ways. They are considerably larger but more placid than the moody and often aggressive black rhino. White rhino are grass grazers, while black rhino eat off scrubs and plants. There is absolutely no colour difference in the two sub-species, they are both grey. Their colour appears at times to vary according to the soil type in the area they live in, so they can also be reddish/brownish/yellowish/whitish at times, all because of the soil on their skin.  The white rhino gets its name from the Dutch (Afrikaans) “Wyd” meaning wide, due to their square mouths designed for grazing. It appears that the English translators might not have heard correctly and perhaps thought the Dutch settlers said “white”. The black rhino is just named the opposite colour of white. They have cleft lips designed for eating leaves from bushes. If we were to rename rhino types again, what would we call them? We could use our imaginations. However, the reality is that they are still called black and white rhino, even though they are actually grey, and sometimes chocolate!
