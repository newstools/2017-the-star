â€‹â€‹Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho has nominated former governor candidate Hezron Awiti’s running mate Hassan Mwamtoa as the executive for Agriculture, Fisheries, Livestock and Cooperatives. The appointment has given credence to rumours Mwamtoa was spying for the incumbent. Three weeks before the August 8 ballot, information was leaked that the banker was being considered for a post in Joho’s administration. Prior to the leak, the Star was informed meetings between Mwamtoa and the governor’s handlers had been held. As a result, Awiti who was then Nyali MP, sidelined Mwamtoa from crucial decision making processes. Awiti’s strategic conventions at Mamba Village, Habo Plaza and other locations went on without Mwamtoa’s input. Fearful of a possible sabotage, Awiti’s strategists removed Mwamtoa from the campaign entourage. Signs of a would-be infiltration sparked when a host of MCA candidates under Awiti’s Vibrant Democratic Party departed him for Jubilee’s Suleiman Shahbal. A member of Awiti’s campaign team said in confidence they blundered by choosing a deputy before their rivals did. “We allowed them to mess us up. They started making advances the moment we unveiled Mwamtoa in Likoni,” he said. Then, Awiti said Mwamtoa’s selection was calculated because he came from a dominant ethnic group – Mijikenda. After the poll, Mwamtoa was not present when a postmortem was being carried out. When reached for comment yesterday, Awiti wished Mwamtoa good luck. “I’m enjoying my business and will not comment on the pertinent issues for now. I have a dossier that will be released soon. The election was rigged,” he said, adding that his VDP remains "neutral, strong and unshaken". Joho’s spokesperson Richard Chacha denied Mwamtoa was their insider. "People should not read too much into his nomination," he said. Chacha said Joho nominated Mwamtoa because he is a qualified Mombasa resident. “When Education executive Tendai Mtana ran against Joho in 2013, he was appointed as an executive. He was not spying for us,” he said on the phone. Awiti got slightly above 4,000 votes while Joho had more than 220,000. Already, former Senator Hassan Omar has filed a petition challenging the win. He had about 44,000 votes. Mwatoa will have to be vetted and approved by the assembly before taking an oath office. He was nominated alongside Seth Odingo (Devolution and Public Service) and Fawz Ali (Trade, Tourism and Investment). The other seven executives have been vetted and approved and will be sworn in today. They are Edward Nyale (Lands, Planning and Housing), Tawfiq Balala (Transport, Infrastructure, and Public Works), Kevin Munyoki (Youth Gender, Sports, and Cultural Affairs) and Godfrey Nyongesa (Environment, Waste Management, and Energy). Others are Hazel Koitaba (Health), Fatma Awale (Water, Sanitation, and Natural Resources) and Maryann Mbaruk (Finance and Economic Planning).
