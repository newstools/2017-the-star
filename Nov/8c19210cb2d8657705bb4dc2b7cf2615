Nakumatt’s main Eldoret branch has resumed operations after being shut down by Eldo Centre on November 3 over Sh21 million in rent arrears. “We hope to restock soon so that our customers can return,” a manager who sought anonymity said. The landlord, Eldo Centre, repossessed the property. Eldoret West OCPD Samuel Mutunga said they received a copy of the closure notice and a letter allowing operations to resume. Nakumatt’s other branch in the town along Ronald Ngala Street remains open. “We urge stakeholders to help Nakumatt resume full operations so we can save jobs and all those whose lives are linked to its operations,” Charles Mose from the Kenya National Chamber of Commerce said. The future of the chain is uncertain.
