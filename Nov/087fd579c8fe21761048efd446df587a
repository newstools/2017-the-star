A teacher and a supervisor were charged yesterday with possession of KCSE exam materials on their phones.  John Kerina, a supervisor at St Patrickâ€™s Kahawa School, and Reuben Mukabane, a teacher at the school, appeared before Nyamira resident magistrate Alice Towett.  DCI officer Stephenson Theuri said they got information about the two.  After arresting them and checking their phones, they found the exam content.  Theuri requested for seven days to conclude investigations.  He also requested that the two be held in police custody, as he gets the person who sent the content arrested. Kerina denied the charge and pleaded with the court to release him.  He said he is allergic to cold and could not cope with the cold conditions in police cells. Mukabane pleaded guilty and said he had not downloaded the content sent to him.  The court ordered that the two be released from custody, as investigations begin.
