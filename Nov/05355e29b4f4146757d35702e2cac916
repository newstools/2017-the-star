A head teacher of a national school in Marakwet recorded a statement yesterday, following suspicions that she engaged in exam irregularities. Moi Kapsowar Girls principal Dinah Cheruiyot (pictured) recorded a statement at the Kapsowar police station, Marakwet West, after allegations that she received a leaked KCSE paper via WhatsApp on Monday. Police boss Apollo Onyonyi said Cheruiyot received a Chemistry paper from David Wafula, a teacher at St Teresa’s Secondary School, Kitale. They have launched investigations and will also look into whether Cheruiyot shared the leaked papers with others. “We have confiscated the principal’s mobile phone as investigations begin. We want to establish whether students received the leaked papers,” Onyonyi said. Elgeyo Marakwet county director of education Joseph Wamoche said the integrity of the exam was not affected by the leakage. He said a comprehensive report will be issued after the conclusion of investigations. “I’ve talked to the principal and she has assured me that she didn’t share the leaked paper because her phone was switched off at the time candidates were sitting the Chemistry exam on Monday,” he said. “I can assure you that the integrity of the exam was not affected at all.”  Senior Education ministry officials in Nairobi are handling the matter, Wamoche added. “This is an isolated case. We’ve been assured by security agencies that measures have been put in place to ensure no exam leakage takes place.”
