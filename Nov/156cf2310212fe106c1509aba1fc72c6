The three-day governors’ induction that was postponed twice will start next Tuesday in Kwale. The meeting will be in Governor Salim Mvurya’s turf. It was moved from Mombasa. â€‹â€‹Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho was stripped of hosting rights because of his hostility to the Jubilee leadership. His push for Coast secession partly contributed to the decision.Yesterday, he said self-rule is irreversible. President Uhuru Kenyatta was earlier expected to attend the meeting. However, he and DP William Ruto will not attend.  Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka will officially open the forum on Tuesday. Others who will attend are Devolution CS Mwangi Kiunjuri, CJ David Maraga and EACC boss Eliud Wabukala. By Wednesday, the Council of Governors hadn’t received cash for the meeting.
