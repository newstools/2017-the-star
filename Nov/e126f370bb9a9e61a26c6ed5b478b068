Kajiado Governor Joseph ole Lenku on Tuesday nominated 12 chief officers after a court blocked vetting of half of his remaining CEC nominees. For about a month, Lenku has been grappling the court decision to stop vetting of five CECs. This followed an injunction sought by outgoing ministers. Lenku (pictured) said he will proceed with half of the CECs because it forms a quorum. Chief officers are usually appointed when the full CEC is in place. The court temporarily upheld applications by six former CECs, who sought a halt to vetting. This is pending outcome of their cases against dismissal before the end of their five-year terms. Florence Mutua, Gladys Marima, Jeremiah Nairowua, Keswe Mapena, Nancy Githua and Ali Letura told a Kajiado court their terms had not expired and vetting and swearing in of new officers would violate their constitutional rights. Almost one-and-half months after a temporary injunction, the case has not been determined. Â
