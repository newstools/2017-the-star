Embu Council of Elders has asked Chief Justice David Maraga to give direction after its members were barred from attending court sessions. On November 16, Embu resident judge Florence Muchemi issued orders barring the elders from attending hearings in a case filed by their chairman Andrew Ireri.  Muchemi said the elders had turned the court into a political forum. The council’s secretary general Patrick Kamwega said the order was illegal and violated their freedom of association.“We want the CJ to explain to uswhe ther he has given a circular barring people from attending court hearings,” Kamwega said. He said Justice Muchemi’s order shocked them because they had not caused chaos in the courtroom.  Muchemi said it was wrong for Ireri to take members of the council to court.  She said the elders were jamming the courtroom. Ireri has filed a petition requesting people to be allowed to represent themselves in court. He is representing himself in the case against the Law Society of Kenya, Embu chief magistrate Maxwell Gicheru and the Attorney General. The case was adjourned for 14 days to allow respondents to file affidavits.
