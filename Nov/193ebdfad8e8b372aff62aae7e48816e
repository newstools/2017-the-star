Two
Petitions, Nos. 2 and 4 of 2017, both challenging the election of the Hon.
Uhuru Kenyatta as President- elect under Article 140 of the Constitution were
filed on 6th November 2017.  By
an Order of this Court issued on 14th November 2017, because of the limited
time, the two petitions were consolidated, and heard together, with each party
being allowed to submit on those issues which the party had separately raised. The
Judges of this Court, thereafter, retired to deliberate upon each of those
issues, which were later summarized as hereunder. Petition
No.2 of 2017 raised five main issues. They are as follows: (i)
 Whether the 1st Respondent was required to conduct fresh nominations
prior to the Presidential election held on 26th October, 2017 and what steps
were required to be undertaken, if at all? â€¨ (ii)
 Were the nominations conducted for the presidential candidates for the
election held 8th August, 2017, valid, after the nullification of that Presidential
elections by the Supreme Court in its decision delivered on1st September? â€¨ When
were the elections held on 8th August, 2017, deemed to have been concluded? Did
another electoral cycle commence? (iii)
 What is the impact, if at all, of the defined time frame provided under
Article 140(3) of the Constitution, for the holding of a fresh election, on the
conduct of nominations? How is this comparable with other forms of Presidential
elections contemplated in the Constitution? â€¨(iv)
 What is the effect of a declaration of invalidity of a Presidential
election under Article 140 of the Constitution? What are the criteria for
qualifying candidates to participate in a fresh election? (v)
 Are the 1st and 2nd Respondents guilty of disobedience of the Supreme
Court Order to conduct the fresh election strictly in accordance with the
Constitution and the applicable laws? Petition
No.4 of 2017 raised nine main issues. They are as follows: (i)
 What is the locus standi of the petitioners, and are they ‘persons’ in
terms of Article 140(1) of the Constitution? Are the petitions properly filed
as Public Interest Litigation? â€¨ (ii)
 What is the legal effect of the withdrawal of a Presidential election
candidate before election? Did any of the Presidential candidates validly or
properly withdraw from the Presidential election held on 26th October, 2017? Did
the 1st and 2nd Respondents conduct the Presidential election held on 26th
October, 2017, in strict conformity with the Constitution and the applicable
laws? â€¨
