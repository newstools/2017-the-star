Kenya Railways has announced changes to the Madaraka Express train service from December 1 as more people will travel. Among the changes are for the train from Nairobi to Mombasa via Athi River, Emali, Kibwezi, Mtito Andei, Voi, Miasenyi and Mariakani to leave the capital at 8am every morning and reach Mombasa at 1am.  The Nairobi bound train will leave Mombasa at 7.15 am and arrive at 1.15pm, after making seven stops along the 472km line. The next trains will leave Nairobi at 2.30pm and Mombasa at 3.30pm. Kenya Railways managing director Atanas Maina noted passenger numbers will increase during the holidays. "Since the inception of the Madaraka Express, we have made notable changes, mostly informed by our stakeholders’ feedback, in an effort to provide smooth service," he said in a statement on Monday. "This timetable revision is a further improvement towards efficient service." The trains move at 120 km/h. The service has been available for five months and has transported 337,000 passengers so far. The government asked the corporation to transport relief food from the Port of Mombasa to the ICD.  This has served as the testing phase for the Freight service and approximately 120,000 tonnes of cereals have been transported to date.
