Thirty-three thousand farmers from Kisii and Nyamira counties have been paid Sh835 million in bonuses through the Wakenya Pamoja Sacco. Sacco CEO Isaac Omwenga said the members have risen from 27,000 last year. At a press conference in Kisii town on Saturday, he encouraged all farmers to open fixed deposit accounts with the sacco to avoid overspending. “I am encouraging farmers to open accounts with our sacco because they are guaranteed the safety of their money,” Omwenga said. Farmers have been educated on the importance of opening accounts. At least 1, 350 groups have accessed loans.  “We have issued Sh437 million in loans. The beneficiaries are those who conduct small businesses and dairy farmers,” Omwenga said.
