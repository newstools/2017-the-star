The Port of Mombasa recorded a 10.6 per cent growth between January and September, despite the prolonged electioneering period, the management has said.
The port handled 22,756,448 tonnes of cargo compared with 20,566,156 tonnes in the corresponding period in 2016, an increase of 2,190,293 tonnes, which is 10.6 per cent growth.
Yesterday, the Kenya Ports Authority managing director Catherine Mturi said despite the political temperatures, the port has remained steadfast in cargo handling. She said the import cargo traffic rose by 10.4 per cent to 19,259,046 tonnes in the nine months of 2017, from 17,441,818 tonnes in a similar period last year.
According to the MD, for the past nine months the rise in import cargo was once again driven by the increase in dry bulk commodities.
The importation of bulk commodities increased by more than 18 per cent in the period under review, said Mturi during the KPA two-day regional media workshop at the Whitesands Hotel Mombasa.
The theme of the workshop is “News Reporting in a Complex Port ecosystem” and KPA-media partnership towards enhancing quality coverage.
Media stakeholders from Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda, DRC Congo, South Sudan are in attendance.
The participants were also told about the global shipping and trade trends and the impact of the standard of the port and the transport sector.
 The MD added, “For example, the importation of wheat in bulk grew by 358,038 tonnes, which is 23.8 per cent followed by fertilisers in bulk which also increased by 87,112 tonnes or 16.8 per cent.”
Refined petroleum and vegetables oils in bulk also registered a positive increase of 4.1 per cent ( 216,639 tonnes) and 22.8 per cent ( 106,120 tonnes) respectively. On the other hand, the export cargo rose slightly by 3.2 per cent.
Last year, KPA handled 2,732,223 tonnes between January and September. However, in 2017 between the same period the port handled 2,820,189 tonnes, an increase of 87,966 tonnes.
“The marginal increase was mainly supported by coffee which increased by 37.7 per cent and tea by 3.6 per cent,” said the MD. She said in the first nine months, container traffic registered 887,412 Twenty-foot equivalent unit up from 804,036 TEUs during the corresponding period in 2016.
This translates to an increase of 83,376 TEUs or 10.4 per cent. Transit cargo also increased from 5,978,090 tonnes in the first nine months of 2016 to 6,487,330 tonnes between the same period.
