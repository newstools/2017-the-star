Evalyne Kabara has joined the list of Kenyan millionaires at age 24 after winning the Betin jackpot of Sh20,621,429. The office assistant had played for three months when she placed a bet of 399. All her 13 predictions were correct. "I took the betting route after a friend introduced me to sport," she said at Nairobi's Kempinski Hotel on Wednesday, when she was declared winner. "After playing multi-bets for some time, I decided try the jackpot with the hopes of winning one day. I didn't expect it to be this soon. I am overwhelmed," Karaba asked Kenyans to continue betting as they could win but to live within their limits. "Check Betin tips as they are helpful," said the winner who received first class treatment at the hotel. Betin will also assign her a financial adviser if she pleases.
