This week the public conversation has been about Kenyans
having a dialogue to break out of the political stalemate. Different ideas have been proposed. The National Council of
Churches of Kenya says we should amend the Constitution and create the position
of Prime Minister and two deputies.  Former Prime Minister Raila Odinga is preparing a People’s
Assembly but no one knows how that will work out.  Some in the ruling Jubilee Party are understood to be
considering amending the Constitution to introduce a Parliamentary system. There have been various other calls for dialogue and
reforming the political system. It is clear the calls for dialogue and change are increasing
and in earnest. President Uhuru Kenyatta should lead this dialogue. Let him
work with the Church, civil society and the opposition, all of whose overriding
objective should be to restore stability to Kenya and we move on together. The Presidency is the symbol of national unity and it is
incumbent on Uhuru to be magnanimous in victory but also tolerant and to work
on his legacy.
