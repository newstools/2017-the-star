President Uhuru Kenyatta has promised to give former Nyeri Governor Wahome Gakuru's a government job. He said he will listen to Catherine, the widow, whenever she seeks his help. Uhuru spoke at Gakuru's funeral service at Kagumo Boys High School, Nyeri, on Saturday. Gakuru, 51, died after a grisly road accident on November 7 near Kabati on the Thika-Murang’a highway. He died at Thika Level 5 Hospital as medics prepared to airlift him to Nairobi. Former President Kibaki was present at the service. Nyeri Governor Mutahi Kahiga had earlier urged Uhuru to give Catherine a job. “Catherine is highly qualified for any job. We are prepared to give her [one], but we fear we shall separate her from the family. We would like our President to look at her in favour,” he said. Catherine, a Human Resource consultant, urged the media to be sensitive to the family when reporting about her husband's demise. Nyeri Senator Ephraim Maina also urged the media to be considerate. The leaders present described Gakuru as visionary, focussed and intelligence. They said he served Nyeri diligently. They included MPs Kanini Kega and Ngunjiri Wambugu. The leaders said they will unite to deliver Gakuru's transformative vision for the county. At least 20 MPs, 20 governors, five senators, five Cabinet Secretaries, Principal Secretaries and 50 MCAs attended the funeral service. Gakuru was buried at his rural home in Kirichu. He has left behind widow, Catherine and three sons – Wangai Gakuru, Mugambi Mwenda and Maina Kimathi.
