Endebess MP Robert Pukose has urged the Trans Nzoia government to train divers to rescue people from floods. He said many drown in rivers during downpours. Pukose (pictured) said many rivers burst their banks and flood, sweeping away property and people.  He spoke on Sunday in Endebess, where he was supporting divers who were searching the body of a 10-year-old child who had drowned on Wednesday. Trans Nzoia rivers have raging waters during rainy seasons. They pose danger to residents, especially where there are no bridges. Pukose cited rivers Nzoia and Sabwani as deathtraps during heavy rains. He said once trained, divers would be on standby to act swiftly and save lives. Pukose urged children not to swim in the rivers and told parents keep them safe.
