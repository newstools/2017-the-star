Webuye East residents have criticised Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati for appointed an “outsider” to head the
county’s Sports and Culture docket.
Residents took to the various social media platforms to reject
Wangamati choice. The governor appointed Evelyne Kakai from Tongaren.
Resident Godfrey Wamalwa on Sunday said
the executive position should be filled by a person from Webuye East. Wamalwa also said Kakai is married in Kisumu and
is rarely seen in Bungoma county. "We all know one of the main reasons former Bungoma Governor Kenneth Lusaka lost in the election is because Tachoni’s were angry with him because he picked Roads executive Stephen Nendela who was living
in Eldoret," he said. He said Webuye East residents want someone who lives in the county and understands their problems. Wangamati’s list
of 10 executive nominees will be vetted from Wednesday next week. Wangamati, while unveiling his cabinet on Thursday, said he picked them from all the nine subcounties in the county. A section of Iteso community have also vowed to move to court to stop Health executive nominee Antony Walela from being vetted. They claim he is not a member of the Iteso clan as said by the governor while appointing him.
