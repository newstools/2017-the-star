The High Court has struck out an election petition challenging the victory of Kamukunji MP Yusuf Hassan. Justice Luca Kimaru ruled that petitioner Ibrahim Ahmed should deposit security of Sh500,000 as required by the Constitution. The judge further ordered Ahmed to pay Sh2 million as cost of the petition. “In view of fact that the parties had prepared for the hearing of the petition and the fact that the actual hearing did not take place, this court caps the costs to be paid to the respondents of Sh2 million,” Kimaru said. He said the requirement for the deposit of security for costs is mandatory. Judge Kimaru said the Constitution does not give a petitioner, who has not deposited requisite security, leeway to choose when to pay security for costs. The petitioner had argued he made an effort to pay the deposit, but was unaware that the cheque he had deposited had bounced.  Kimaru rejected that explanation. He said it is the petitioner’s duty to make sure his account contains sufficient funds. “Requirement for deposit for security of costs is a substantive legal requirement, not a technicality this court can excuse,” he ruled. Ahmed had moved to court challenging Yusuf’s election, asking the court to nullify the election.  He said there were many irregularities that happened during the election. However, Yusuf had asked the court to dismiss the election petition, saying failure by the petitioner to make the deposit for security cost within the stipulated time of 10 days after the filing of the petition renders the petition fatally defective and unsustainable.
