It is extremely expensive to run the Coast Provincial General Hospital and Mombasa county cannot run it on its own, Health executive nominee Hazel Koitaba has said. Other counties from the region must contribute to a common pool or the only referral hospital risk being disabled, she said. Koitaba spoke on Friday when she was vetted for the seat at the assembly. She said conditional grants from the Health ministry are meagre. The fund is also released late, hurting treatment and drug purchase, Koitaba said. Records from Commission on Revenue Allocation show that up to 2016-17 financial year, the county had received Sh1.4 billion. More than Sh262 million had been disbursed for free maternal and health care. Koitaba said despite the hospital serving all Coast residents, only Mombasa incurs the huge operation cost. "There is no compensation from neighbouring counties. We must lobby to find a solution," she said The ballooning wage bill, constant strikes from health practitioners is also troubling the Hassan Joho-led county. The county has severely suffered the brunt of industrial actions and Koitaba said performance contracts must be introduced. "It is difficult to isolate workers from the union and the contract will avert the strikes," she said. Koitaba said the ratio of doctors to patients is 1:18,000, is "absurd". "Recruitment is necessary," she said, defeating her statement that the docket is financially crippled. More staff will mean additional cost. Kenyaâ€™s health sector has been heavily centralised since 1963, with power concentrated in Nairobi.
