The attack on journalists by youths at the joint Parliamentary Group meeting of NASA parties at Wiper headquarters, Nairobi, yesterday was an outrage. The youths were annoyed that Citizen TV’s tallying of voting at the presidential repeat election seemed to confirm the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission’s own count. NASA is completely contemptuous of the IEBC. The Nation Media Group’s crime was recording the unfolding fracas. NASA was quick to apologise and say the youths acted spontaneously and on their own. The apology is accepted, but we must point out the principle in football that sees the bad behaviour of players and fans blamed on the whole team should apply in political parties too. NASA must retrain and discipline their youths. This should not happen again. Attacking journalists at a live news event is dumb. The journalists packed up all their equipment and went away. All the NASA leaders have the contacts of many senior journalists and media managers. Youth-winger groupies have no business engaging the media in this manner.
