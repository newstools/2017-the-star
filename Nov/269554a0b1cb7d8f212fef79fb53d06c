Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja has visited scenes where property was damaged or looted during NASA protests on Friday. "Assessing some of the damage caused today in Nairobi. My heart goes out
to those who've lost loved ones, their property and livelihoods. This must stop," he tweeted. He also posted photos of the shell of a matatu that was burnt on Jogoo road by alleged Opposition supporters. "Nairobi leadership will tomorrow issue a comprehensive statement and direction on the way forward," Sakaja said. Tear gas, gunshots and running battles were the order of the
day for NASA supporters as they welcomed their leader Raila Odinga back
from US. Preparations were in advance and a large crowd was anticipated despite a warning by IG Joseph Boinnet. "We will resist all forms of intimidation," one protester was heard saying. The term 'resist' has not left supporters' mouths since NASA
MPs chanted it while announcing a boycott of products by Bidco,
Brookside Dairies and telecommunication giant Safaricom. Another said: "Mbona wanataka kutuua? Tumefanya nini (Why do they want to kill us? What have we done)?"  Some of the people angered by police response picked up the
canisters they fired and hurled them back. The number of officers
increased as the crowds became more unruly. A Reuters photographer claimed two people were killed in demonstrations, while police claimed five looters were killed by mobs. Police spokesperson George Kinoti has denied the use of live bullets against demonstrators. Read: Amnesty International alarmed over use lethal force on NASA protesters
