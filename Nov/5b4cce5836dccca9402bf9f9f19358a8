Wiper Party has chided an attack on Kathiani MP Robert Mbui on Friday after chaos erupted when Opposition leader Raila Odinga jetted back in the country. In a statement, executive director Jared Siso blamed the Jubilee administration for "beastly violence" meted out on innocent citizens. "The violence which led to deaths of more than five Kenyans, occasioned severe injuries on others and led to wanton destruction of property, could have been avoided had the regime cared to follow the law as well as the dictates of the Constitution," he said on Saturday. He claimed the attack on Mbui was a "plot to terminate him" because of his steadfastness in supporting NASA. "Only a quick intervention by well meaning Kenyans saved Mbui's life. He is currently admitted at the Nairobi Hospital, where he has just undergone a successful surgery on his broken leg." Siso said the attack and any other intimidation by the government "will not deter us from freeing Kenya from the shackles of despotism and dictatorship". Last week, the MP led other party leaders in issuing a statement stating that Wiper remained resolute in ensuring that Jubilee regime is removed from power through legal and constitutional means. He laughed off attempts by Jubilee to split NASA through divide-and-rule tactics. His vehicle was teargassed after which he rolled into a ditch and was injured. Five people were reportedly stoned to death by mobs during the NASA protests, police said. Spokesperson George Kinoti said they were caught stealing and killed by angry mobs. He said two were stoned along Landhies road, two others were killed next to country bus station and another was killed along Racecourse road.
