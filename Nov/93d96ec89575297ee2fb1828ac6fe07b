Argentina's navy says it is worried about oxygen levels inside the submarine that went missing last Wednesday in the southern Atlantic. Forty-four people are on board the ARA San Juan, which vanished after it reported an electric breakdown. A navy spokesman, Enrique Balbi, said a massive search operation would continue until the vessel was located. Better weather conditions on Tuesday, after days of rough sea, have given new hope to relatives of the missing crew. But Mr Balbi cautioned: "We are considering all possibilities and obviously the most critical situation would be the fact that we are on the sixth day of oxygen." The search effort has now been narrowed down to an area of 20km by 20km (12 miles), he added. On Monday, navy officials said that noises picked up by two search vessels did not come from the sub, the second false alarm to hit the search. The ARA San Juan was returning from a routine mission to Ushuaia, near the southern-most tip of South America, when it reported an "electrical breakdown". According to naval commander Gabriel Galeazzi, the submarine surfaced and reported the breakdown, which Capt Galeazzi described as a "short circuit" in the sub's batteries. The sub was ordered to cut its mission short and return to the naval base in Mar del Plata immediately. According to navy spokesman Enrique Balbi, the captain of the ARA San Juan contacted the naval base once more after reporting the problem. In the message, he reportedly said that the problem had been adequately fixed and that the sub would submerge and proceed towards Mar del Plata naval base. The last contact was made at 07:30 local time (10:30 GMT) on Wednesday 15 November. It is not known what happened to the sub after that contact.
