Wahu Kagwi has released her first gospel single, Sifa, after turning over a new leaf. The now gospel artiste says she is closer to God than ever after personal difficulties late last year. "I went through a couple of tough situations, it just reignited a relationship I had with God. I'm so happy about my space right now. My priority right now is my relationship with God." She said she was brought up in a Christian family and is now just reconnecting with her roots. "I am a born-again believer. I have refocused myself in the sense that my relationship with God is my priority. I want my music to speak of where I am right now. I feel the connection and I want it to be a true reflection of where I'm at." The Sweet Love hit maker went on to tell critics to stop judging people and instead focus on their own business. "I can't judge anyone. People need to mind their own business. What should matter is my relationship with God, where my heart is. I know my truth, so let's stop judging each other. The only one who can judge me is God." The mother of two, who is married to fellow artiste Nameless, said her husband is under medication after he was admitted for a couple of days, having undergone a surgery. "He is good. It was quite crazy. He's not the type of guy to be unwell. He's been healthy and from nowhere, he just got sick. I really saw God coming through." The singer, who is also a businesswoman and has had a booming cosmetic business, said young people should stop giving up. "There is a lot of learning that I had to adapt to. In the first years of any business, it is never glamorous, you have to push. Many people give up when they are about to make it."
