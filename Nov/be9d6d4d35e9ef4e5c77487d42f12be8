The Education ministry has deregistered St Theresa Girls Senior School in Nakuru county over allegations of malpractice in  KCSE examinations. The offence was allegedly committed on November 9 and 10. "It has been decided that the registration of your school be revoked with effect December 1, 2017," PS Belio Kipsang said in a letter on Monday. Kipsang said the school should hand its certificate of registration to the county education board secretary. "This should be done with immediate effect. Bring this information to the attention of parents at the school," he said. The letter was copied to to Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i . Earlier today, Matiangi warned private schools against engaging in cheating saying they will be de-registered. He said the ministry and Teachers Service Commission will also punish centre managers and examination officials found culpable.
