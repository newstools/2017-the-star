The Sonko rescue team retrieved the body of Veronica Muthoni, a victim of Lake Nakuru helicopter crash. Led by Moses Owala, the team of 10 led managed to locate and retrieve the body that was later take to Umash Funeral Home. On Friday at noon, the divers had spotted the wreckage of the ill fated chopper that crashed into the lake 29 days ago. Jonathan Keratich, National Disaster Operations desk officer, said the helicopter was 70 per cent intact. The wreckage was located 2.44km on the western end of the lake and was lying about 5.4m deep. He said that since the first two bodies were found to the east and to the north of the lake, there was a likelihood that the other three bodies are trapped in the wreckage. The recovery of Muthoni’s body has rekindled hopes of finding the bodies of Sam Gitau and John Mapozi. But the divers have to comb the the rest of the waters to find the two missing bodies. Earlier in the afternoon there was drama at the Lake Nakuru national park main gate after journalists and some of the relatives to the missing persons were barred from accessing the main rescue camp. Owala assured the families that they will find the remaining bodies. "We feel for the families of the deceased and know what they are undergoing ... they will soon retrieve the bodies since they have combing both the forest area and the waters," he said. He added that the exercise could have been concluded but heavy rains have curtailed them. “We are very optimistic. Actually if it were not for the dirty water and poor visibility, this exercise could be over and all bodies retrieved. "We did this during the Mtongwe ferry tragedy in 1994 where over 200 people perished," said the international diver. The chopper's pilot Apollo Malowa was buried on November 2.
