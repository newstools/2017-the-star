Elders from Garissa have called on President Uhuru Kenyatta to call for a national dialogue. According to them, the forum, whose main aim will be to deliberate on changes to the constitution, should bring together leaders from the different political divide, the clergy, civil society and Kenyans at large. Speaking to the press in Garissa town on Tuesday, the elders, led by Kenya Farmers Federation Vice chair Dubat Amey said that a solution to Kenyan problem lies in the changing the constitution to a hybrid system. “Majority of Kenyans are of the opinion that we change the constitution. it is the genesis of all our problems.this winner takes all mentality is not doing well for the peace and unity of thi country, what happens to the more than 6 million Kenyans who voted for the opposition,” quipped Amey. He added: “Never has our country been so much divided like we are currently witnessing. While we have a section that is celebrating, we another one that is so disgruntled. worse of it is the fact that all this has now taken ethnic dimensions,”. President Kenyatta during his swearing in ceremony at Kasarani said that he was a president of all Kenyans an he will strive to unite. NASA leader Raila Odinga on the other hand while addressing his supporters at Jacaranda said that he will be sworn in as the peoples president on 12th of December. Dubat who read the statement on behalf of his colleagues further said that sharing power was not a lasting solution to the problems bedeviling the county. The elders called on the president to form a cabinet that will be holistic and one which will reflect the face of Kenya. The elders urged Kenyans to embrace unity see each other as Kenyans who belong to one country.
