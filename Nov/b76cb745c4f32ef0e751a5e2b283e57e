Kenya is free from Guinea worms, deputy director of Medical Services Peter Cherutich has said. He said yesterday the country will be certified as a Guinea worm-free country in the next two weeks. “This will mean the country is making progress to have a healthier population. We have also been able to eradicate smallpox. This should be an aspiration for Kenyans to rid ourselves of diseases. Any disease eradication is a step towards health and prosperity,” Cherutich said. A team from the WHO will be visiting the country late this month to provide the certification, he added. “We are confident we don’t have transmission of Guinea worms anymore. We are looking forward for the WHO team to finally confirm that,” Cherutich said. WHO says the last time Kenya reported a Guinea worm case was 1994. During the 2015 National Immunisation Day, 6,135,622 households were searched and no case was reported. Last year, a Sh100,000 cash reward was offered by the Health ministry for the voluntary reporting of cases of Guinea-worm disease. Nothing has been reported.
