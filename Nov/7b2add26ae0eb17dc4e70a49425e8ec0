The Kenya Conference of Catholic Bishops has offered to lead talks that will end the standoff in the country. They asked political leaders to engage in dialogue to end the stalemate arising from the October 26 presidential election. Led by vice chairman Rev John Owaa, the clergymen said the political class have to be mindful of the country and save it from civil strife and anarchy. Bishop Philip Anyolo, in a statement signed by 24 bishops from various dioceses, said that they have resolved to organize a national dialogue forum. "This is aimed at bringing all Kenyans together to look at the true picture of the country and set the agenda for true discussion and resolutions," Anyolo said. The church leader addressed the country during a plenary meeting at Christ the King Cathedral in Nakuru on Thursday. They offered to create a dialogue forum for conversations on electoral reforms, national healing and reconciliation. "We shall offer an opportunity to all Kenyans, religious leaders, civil society groups, political groups for a constructive talk on the way forward for the country." "We will re-look certain areas of the Constitution of Kenya 2010 that still remain problematic," he said. During the meeting, the bishops eulogised all fallen bishops and Bishop Cornelius Korir of Eldoret Diocese. His Eminence John Cardinal Njue also made special prayers to the nation for Kenyans to embrace peace. He emphasized on the scripture on abuse on sanctuaries and discouraged church leaders allowing politicians to play politics in church. "The church members should also stop using mobile phones in church streaming hate speech and sanitizing corruption," the Bishop said. He urged congregates to desist from being agents of hate speech and divisions. "Delete all the hate messages in your phones and never be a source of division," he urged church members. The Catholic Bishops held a gathering for a plenary meeting in Nakuru to celebrate the Holy Mass in memory of the late Bishop Korir. Â
