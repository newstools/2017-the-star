Base Titanium mining firm has not provided jobs or initiated projects for residents, Msambweni MP Suleiman Dori has said. The firm's management says it has employed at least 64 per cent of Kwale residents. But Dori dismissed this as a marketing strategy. He spoke at the CDF offices. "The company has not trained any youth in this constituency as they had promised when they came," Dori said. He said it's only five years to the end of the Base Titanium contract, but youths still fell trees for the company. "They told us they will pass on the management skills to the youth in the county so that they can take over when the contract has lapsed, but there is nothing so far," Dori added. The MP said he was astonished when he heard the company had been named by the national government the best investor for Vision 2030. "How is it possible when our people are still jobless and continue to cut down trees for the company for a living?" Dori said. Â
