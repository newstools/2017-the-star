 Twelve people escaped death yesterday at dawn when two vehicles collided head-on in Manguo, Limuru constituency, on the Nairobi-Nakuru highway. Police said the accident occurred when the driver of a Toyota Probox that was heading towards Nakuru lost control and collided-head on with a matatu. Motorist Geoffrey Ndung'u said they heard a loud bang from behind. "The Probox was behind our van. We helped evacuate the victims from the wreckage,” he said. Ndung'u said the victims were taken to hospital in a lorry, since no other vehicle stopped to assist them. Area police boss Eunice Githure said the driver of the Probox suffered serious injuries and was taken to Kikuyu Hospital. She said the matatu passengers also sustained injuries and they were taken to Limuru Nursing Home, where they were treated and discharged. “We have started investigations to establish what happened before the accident occurred,” she said. Gichure urged motorists to follow traffic rules in order to avoid such accidents.
