Gatanga MP Joseph Nduati has urged the government not to disburse revenue to counties whose assemblies have passed motions to support the People’s Assembly. The MP said the county assemblies have gone against the law by passing the motions that allow the opposition to carry out its protests in NASA strongholds. Nduati said matters regarding the nation can only be discussed in the National Assembly and that using the People’s Assembly is using an illegal shortcut to access power. The MP spoke at Gatura Catholic Church in Gatanga constituency on Sunday. He said the opposition is just intent on causing unnecessary conflict as Kenyans struggle to recover from the divisions caused by the elections. Nduati said the opposition led by Raila Odinga is corrupting the county assemblies and diverting their attention from their primary role of legislating on development matters in the counties.
