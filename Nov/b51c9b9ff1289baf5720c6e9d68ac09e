Two
friends who went out for a picnic before being reported missing two days ago were on Wednesday found
having drowned in a dam in Mbeere South sub-county.
 The bodies of Erick Mutembei and Lawrence Ndwiga, all 20-year-old,Â  were recovered from Katarati dam in Nguru village during a search.  Mbeere
South police boss Ahmed Mohammed said Mutembei's father Samuel
Njeru and a neighbor reported the case of the missing men at the Kiritiri police station. He
said the search team spotted one of the bodies at the dam after which divers combed through the waters to fetch the second one. "They were removed
from the dam and taken to the Embu Level Five teaching and referral hospital
mortuary," Ahmed said.
 "It is suspected that one of the men might have slipped in the dam and the
other one tried to rescue before they both drowned." The OCPD said a postmortem will be conducted on the
bodies to ascertain the cause of the death or whether there was foul
play. Click here for more political news
