The Kenya Union of Post Primary Education Teachers has voiced concern over the concentration of KCSE exam marking centres in Central.  The marking will take place in Nairobi, Murang’a, Kiambu and Limuru.  Kuppet’s Zablon Awange demanded that the Kenya National Examinations Council decentralises the centres as before.  He said Western Kenya centres such as Kisumu Polytechnic, St Mary’s School, Yala, Mukumu Girls’ High, Kakamega Boys, Sigalagala, Lugulu and Moi Girls, Eldoret, were last year abolished in favour of Murang’a, Kiambu and Nairobi.  Awange blamed that on political interests and demanded the centres be restored.  “It was political and we demand that Knec decentralises the centres as before,” he said.  The unionist added that most examiners fear for their safety in case political tension escalates.  He also said examiners from Central get undue advantage in case of a crisis in the transport sector.
