More than 50 grassroot leaders in Nyeri have defended Senator Ephraim Maina over his call for Devolution CS Mwangi Kiunjuri to be dropped from the Cabinet. While acknowledging that appointment to Cabinet is a sole prerogative of President Uhuru Kenyatta, the leaders said Maina was right to demand that one slot is preserved for Nyeri county. They argued that Nyeri and Laikipia are neighbours and that it is time Kiunjuri is dropped for someone from Nyeri to take over. Led by Simon Gitahi, the leaders who met at Anna Bell hotel, said Maina's opinion should be respected. “Laikipia had it’s chance for five years. It is now our chance as Nyeri county to also have our CS,” Gitahi said. Another leader, Margaret Nyathogora, critcised Nyeri elected leaders for castigating Maina. Her criticism was backed by Steve Nderi who asked the leaders to apologise. Meanwhile, two groups have clashed in Nyeri over Maina's opinion. The groups fought on Monday as each defended either Maina or Kiunjuri. Maina was last week reported to have proposed that Kiunjuri be dropped in favour of someone from Nyeri.
