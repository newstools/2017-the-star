President Uhuru Kenyatta has a chance to correct the political mess in the country after being cleared by the Supreme Court,  a varsity don has said.       Prof Sammy Kubasu of Masinde Muliro University told the Star in Kakamega yesterday Uhuru should reach out to NASA chief Raila Odinga. Kubasu said the biggest problem Kenya faces is failure by leaders to respect constitutional institutions and deep rooted  tribalism. “Uhuru has gone over the first hurdle and he must now confront the elephant in the house- how to unify the sharply divided country,” he said. “He should stand firm as the President and put things right. This is his final term, he has to leave a legacy,” Kubasu said.      Supreme Court judges on Monday dismissed two petitions challenging Uhuru’s October 26 presidential rerun win, saying they lacked merit.
