The Bungoma High Court on Thursday stopped the vetting of 10 nominated executives after the minority Teso community complained it had been sidelined. The community obtained an injunction granted by High Court judge Justice Abida Aroni. Teso spokesman David Kapule submitted a petition to block further vetting . Speaking to the press at Chrisinas Hotel in Kimilili town on Friday, Kapule said the community was being marginalised though it voted overwhelmingly for Governor Wycliffe Wangamati on August 8. “We are the third largest community in Bungoma county after the Bukusus and Tachonis. But the governor sidelined us when he unveiled the list of potential executive nominees. The, Iteso community is not represented,” Kapule said. The community earlier had been satisfied by nomination of Anthony Walela for Health and Sanitation. During vetting, however, Walela told the vetting at KIE on Wednesdaythat he is not an Iteso and insisted that he was an original Bukusu. “Chairman, I will disappoint the Iteso elders that am not a Teso but a Bukusu, even if am greeted in Iteso, I can’t answer back,” Walela told the vetting committee. This angered the Iteso elders who sought the court order to stop the vetting until the matter is heard and determined. They obtained the orders on Thursday which was served to the governor, county secretary and the speaker of the county assembly. The committee on appointments chaired by the speaker of the assembly Emmanuel Situma had vetted seven nominees and the remaining three were to face the committee on Friday. Speaker Emmanuel Situma stopped the process, saying they will abide by the law by waiting. “I have stopped the sittings until further notice,” Situma said. The hearing has been scheduled for November 22.
