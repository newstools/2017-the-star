The Executive should be expanded to include the position of Prime Minister to foster unity and peace, the NCCK said yesterday.

The leaders were led by National Council of Churches of Kenya secretary general Canon Peter Karanja. The said the 2010 Constitution perpetuates division by completely locking out the opposition from power. “These divisions are expressions of unresolved grievances and perceptions of exclusion and denial of dignity of the opposition by the arrangement of power as defined in the Constitution of Kenya 2010,” Karanja said. He spoke hours after a lobby group called We The People described the repeat presidential petition as a sham and demanded the disbandment of the IEBC.  Amend law The council urged Parliament to consider constitutional amendments to introduce additional offices and eliminate the winner-take-all scenario.  The churches proposed the creation of slots for two deputy PM who, together with the premier, sit in the Cabinet and may answer questions directly in Parliament.  “We hasten to add this is an expanded Executive of the winning party or coalition and not a nusu mkate arrangement,” Karanja said. “If coalitions are made with parties or individuals who ran for election outside the winning party or election, it would be at the discretion of and under the unequivocal leadership of the elected president.”  To provide dignity to the opposition, the NCCK suggested the creation of a facilitated position of leader of opposition and his or her deputy to hold the government to account.  The council defended last Thursday’s repeat presidential election and urged aggrieved parties to go to court.
