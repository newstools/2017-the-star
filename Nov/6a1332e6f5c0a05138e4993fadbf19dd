Three suspects have been arraigned in a Thika court in connection with the Sh50 million theft at KCB’s Thika branch. Helford Munene Murakaru, 32, Charles Mwangi Murakaru, 30, and Julius Ndung’u, 32, appeared before Thika chief magistrate Theresa Murigi yesterday and pleaded not guilty to three charges. The prosecution told the court between November 18 and 20, the suspects, jointly with others who were not in the court, entered KCB through an underground tunnel and stole Sh52,650,000, AUD95, €185, £1,630, TSh271,000, USh947,000, $5,781, ZAR40 and CAD5. The suspects were also charged with handling stolen property contrary to section 322 ( 1 ) ( 2 ) of the Penal Code. They denied the charge. They were also charged with a third count that on November 25 at Joy Land Estate in Juja, dishonestly handled Sh17,135,000, $1,311, £340, €3,660, CAD5, AUD85, Tsh26,000, ZAR40 and Ush20,000. Plea for bail The suspects were represented by Counsel Opiyo Zacky Odegi, who pleaded with the court to grant the suspects lenient bail and bond terms. “Bail and bonds are constitutional rights and my clients are not exceptional. They were arrested in their house in Thika on Saturday and have been in police custody for the whole weekend,” he said. The lawyer argued that his clients are not flight risks and that they are ready to face justice. However, his application was objected by state counsel Stella Oyagi, who said the prosecution had compelling reasons to deny the suspects bond or bail. Referring to a sworn affidavit by the investigations officer in the case, Oyagi said that the accused were planning to leave the country. Click here for the latest political news
