Results for the Yatta parliamentary election were altered at the constituency tallying centre, the Machakos High Court heard on Monday. Chama Cha Uzalendo chief agent Samuel Mulei said he found IEBC officials altering results at Kithimani tallying centre.  "I found forms being altered at the tallying centre. There were a few people. I was with one of the witnesses who has sworn an affidavit," Mulei said. He testified in a petition filed by Former Yatta MP Francis Mwangangi challenging the election of Charles Kilonzo.  Read: Court dismisses application to strike out Yatta election petition Mulei told Justice Aggrey Muchelule that CCU agents were denied access to some polling stations.  He said they did not sign some of the forms and that they were denied permission to transmit the results.  Mwangangi's lawyers, led by Andrew Makundi, also asked to be shown the polling stations' diaries which indicate what happened at the polling stations.  He said the diaries will also reveal whether CCU agents were present at the stations. The court adjourned to allow the parties time to access the diaries and the KIEMS kit which are in a warehouse. Kilonzo (Independent) was declared winner with 17,888 votes against Mwangangi's (CCU) 11,350 votes. The hearing continues on Wednesday. Click here for the latest political news
