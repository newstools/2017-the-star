Discrepancies affected 196 polling stations out of the 1,126 in Kisii county, a court hearing an election petition heard yesterday. A petitioner challenging the election of Governor James Ongwae said 184 of the affected polling stations were all in Bobasi constituency. Joel Makori said the constituency votes were 3,000 more than the number of registered voters. He said the anomalies affected the credibility and transparency of the August 8 election. Makori, who was cross examined by Ongwae’s lawyers, cited Kemoreko Primary School polling station where he said Form 37A indicated Ongwae had received 264 votes while Form 37C indicated he had garnered 276 votes. Makori is one of two petitioners who have challenged Ongwae’s win. The other is Mochoge Omao. Both have sued county returning officer Sidney Namulungu, the IEBC, Ongwae, Deputy Governor Joash Maangi and Naftal Obwocha as first, second, third, foruth and fifth respondents respectively. On cross-examination by lawyer Omwanzo Ombati, Makori said he filed the petition as a Jubilee party chief agent. The petitioners closed their case yesterday after their main witness finished presenting his evidence. Witness Dennis Nyaundi told the court data from IEBC’s public portal indicated discrepancies in votes cast in various polling stations. Another witness, Brian Omwenga, failed to testify after a document he was relying on was expunged by the court in a preliminary application by Ongwae. Omwenga, an IT expert, was expected to show how results in the portal differed with those used to declare results. Ongwae’s lead lawyer Okong’o Omogeni had opposed the use of the documents, saying the respondents were not served within the stipulated time.  The hearing continues Monday when Namulungu is expected to be cross examined by Omwanza .
