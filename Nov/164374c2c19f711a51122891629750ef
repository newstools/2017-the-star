Poor visibility caused by dirty water, heavy rains and a wide search area have been blamed for the delay in retrieving bodies of Lake Nakuru helicopter crash victims. National Disater Operation Centre officer Jonathan Kertich said heavy silt and mud in the lake and presence of wild animals are also posing challenges in the search of the bodies. A chopper crashed into the lake on October 21 with five people on board. Only two bodies, Apollo Malowa and Anthony Kipyegon, have been retrieved. Three others, Veronicah Muthoni, Sam Gitau and John Mapozi, are yet to be retrieved. Both Malowa and Kipyegon have been buried. They were buried in Siaya and Baringo counties respectively. The wait for the bodies to be retrieved had brought agony to family members of the victims. Kertich said Lake Nakuru had swollen because of heavy rains. He also said the water was dirty, thus hampering divers visibility. He said the rescue team was concentrating on the half of the lake which they had not covered in their search. "We have several search teams with boats. We hope we will
retrieve the remaining bodies and the helicopter wreckage despite the
challenges," Kertich said. More than 40 divers are combing the lake in search of the bodies. Last week, divers from the Mining ministry joined the search. Others in the search are divers from the Kenya Navy, the National Police Service, KWS, Kenya Red Cross, Sonko Rescue Team and Lake Naivasha. "We wonder why such a team of divers has failed to retrieve the bodies for two weeks now," Gitau's father Willy Ngugi said.
