Turkana Governor Josphat Nanok has dismissed reports he was involved in an accident on Waiyaki way in Nairobi. Nanok said it is a pity that social media - Facebook and Twitter - is being misused to spread fake news. "I am well. Ignore the fake news that I was involved in a road accident," he noted on Wednesday. Earlier today, Nanok chaired a meeting of the Council of Governors to make arrangements for the funeral of Nyeri Governor Wahome Gakuru The meeting established a national committee that he will co-chair with ICT Cabinet Secretary Joe Mucheru. The tentative date for the funeral is November 18 and the costs will be paid by the council, the national government and Nyeri county. The Governor said their aim is to give Gakuru a proper send off.
