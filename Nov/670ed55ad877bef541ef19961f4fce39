The Murang’a government has sacked 427 nurses for absconding from duty. They had resumed work following an agreement between the Council of Governors and the Kenya National Union of Nurses to end the five-month strike. In the agreement, nurses’ uniform and risk allowances were increased. All the cases filed against them were withdrawn. Murang’a nurses, however, were blocked from entering health facilities when they reported to work on Friday. The county government directed that no nurse be allowed into the hospitals. Health executive Joseph Mbai said the nurses had been replaced after several pleas to resume work. “We appealed to them to go back to work because the sector was struggling and patients were suffering, but only a few heeded our calls,” he said.  The nurses’ union and the county government have engaged in numerous court fights over delayed salaries and remittance of statutory deductions.
