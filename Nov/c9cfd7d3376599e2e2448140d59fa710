Nyeri Governor Wahome Gakuru will be buried on November 18 at his Kirichu home in Nyeri Town constituency. Deputy governor Mutahi Kahiga yesterday said this is the proposed date, but they want Gakuru's son to have sat all his papers first. He is a candidate at Alliance High School. Gakuru died on Tuesday morning in a horrific accident at Kabata, on the Thika-Murang'a highway. He was on his way to Nairobi for an interview with a vernacular radio station. Kahiga told journalists two burial committees have been formed (national and county). Relatives and friends will be meeting at Gakuru’s Runda home in Nairobi and Kirichu home. A requiem mass has been planned in Nairobi sometime next week. “We want to ensure the governor is given a decent burial. Nyeri should now stay united and ensure an honourable burial is given to our late governor,” Kahiga said. Meanwhile, legal officers are working on Kahiga's swearing-in as governor. Sources from Town Hall, Nyeri, which houses the governor’s office said the deputy governor might be sworn in before tomorrow. Kahiga will be the fourth Nyeri governor to take office in a span of 10 months. The county's first governor, Nderitu Gachagua, died of pancreatic cancer on February 24. He was succeeded by Deputy Governor Samuel Wamathai, as outlined in the Constitution. Gakuru was elected on August 8. Kahiga now takes over as governor. A group of pastors from Nyeri has called for prayers for the county. Led by Nyeri Pentecostal Movement Bishop Erastus Njoroge, they said they will conduct prayers tomorrow to ward off evil from the county. “We need to pray for the bad spirit hovering in Nyeri since we first lost our first governor Nderitu Gachagua and now Wahome Gakuru,” Njoroge said. Bishop Wachira Karani of the Kenya Assemblies of God said they had hoped Gakuru would take Nyeri to new heights. KTDA board chairman Peter Kanyago mourned Gakuru, saying the county has lost a visionary leader.
