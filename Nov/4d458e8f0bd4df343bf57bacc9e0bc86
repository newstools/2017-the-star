Funguo Investments Limited, partly owned by parastatal ICDC, is targeting the mid market investor with an investment offering of Sh100 million, the company has disclosed. The fresh capital raising venture will be used to expand and diversify its investment portfolio, chief executive Kenneth Muchina has disclosed. “We are at advanced stages of these pursuits, and new announcements will be made in diverse sectors,” he said in a statement. The company, whose appeal is the niche market of investors with an appetite for private equity risks and attendant returns, is also exploring managed funds and co-investment programs to mobilize capital for investment programs. There will be consideration for larger and smaller investment amounts in a mix of early stage and established but growing businesses.   Funguo’s strategic plan provides the company with the framework to keep an eye on what is happening in the environment in which it invests, allowing it to adjust tactics within its shorter term plans, such as annual budgets, as needed. “We have over the years intentionally sought to diversify the asset classes that we are invested in, and the sectors of the economy that we are exposed to; which allows us to expand our ‘investee’ client base,” said the chief executive. Most private equity funds in Kenya prefer making investments of at least Sh300 million and up to Sh1 billion.
