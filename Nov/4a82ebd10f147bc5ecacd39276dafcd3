National Cohesion and Integration Commission member Adan Mohamed has urged governors agitating for the secession of the Coast to shelve their plans. He challenged them to use their resources to develop their counties. Speaking during a women’s dialogue forum on post-election healing and reconciliation in Kilifi, Mohamed said the region is receiving billions of shillings which if well utilised can develop the region. “Those who are calling for secession are doing so under the guise of marginalisation. The devolved system of government created the Equalisation Fund which runs for 20 years from 2013,” he said. “Most of the Coast counties are receiving this fund which is meant to bring the region at par with other regions in terms of development.” Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi and his Mombasa counterpart Hassan Joho have been pushing for the secession of the Coast. They are backed by NASA affiliated legislators from the region. Plans are underway to table the secession bill in the National Assembly. The bill will be tabled by Kiilifi North MP Owen Baya. On Monday, Kaloleni MP Paul Katana said they will soon embark on a tour of the Coast to sell the secession agenda. Mohamed warned that this is not the right time to talk about disintegration and urged the leaders to come together and reconcile. “The Coast region heavily relies on tourism as its main economic muscle. The industry is fragile, especially when there is no cohesion. The President spoke on historical injustice and said he would right the wrongs,” the commissioner said. Kilifi woman representative Gertrude Mbeyu said it will be hard for the region to move forward when most people feel they did not get justice during the election. Mbeyu said the only way for the country to move forward is for the President to order a stop to the killing of innocent people.
