A Kiambu MP yesterday described NASA’s National Resistance Movement as “noise made by the last kicks of a dying horse”. Lari MP Jonah Mburu said NASA leaders were looking for relevance when they urged their supporters to boycott some services and products. “NASA’s unacceptable demands and protests are noise. NRM will come to an end. They will get tired. Their problem is that they do not accept the truth, even if there are facts. All they do is try to gain relevance among their supporters,” he said. Mburu said the NASA leadership didn’t have anything else to advise their supporters to do. They were misled to do some activities they cannot completely avoid, he added. Mburu urged NASA to accept the Supreme Court ruling that validated President Uhuru Kenyatta’s victory in the presidential rerun on October 26.
