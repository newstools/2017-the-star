The race to remain in the SportPesa Premier League takes an interesting angle today when bottom placed Muhoroni Youth host Bandari FC at Muhoroni in a round of 32 matches, seeking a win to re-ignite their dwindling fortunes. Muhoroni take on the visiting Bandari who had to take refuge at Ahero Police Station following the ongoing demonstrations witnessed in the Nyanza region.  The dockers were blocked from accessing Kisumu town by demonstrators who took to the streets to express their displeasure following the outcome of the repeat presidential elections hence forcing them to seek refuge at the police station. Muhoroni risk being dropped to the National Super League if their poor run persist and the only way to overturn it will be a win against Bandari.  Muhoroni are currently sitting at the bottom of the standings with 25 points and a win would take their tally to 28 points and hope that Thika United, who have 29 points fall to Sony.  Bandari are upbeat despite their tribulations on their way to Kisumu. According to their head coach Paul Nkata, the squad is made up of men who can handle pressure.   “They are strong men who can handle pressure. I expect them to put behind the bad memories and win the match. They are strong and these scenes are bound to happen it’s life. We hope the match will go as planned.” In other matches lined up for the day, champions Gor Mahia play Western Stima at Moi, Kasarani while Nzoia face Leopards in Mumias.  Nakumatt welcome fellow debutants Zoo Kericho at Ruaraka with Ulinzi Stars playing Kariobangi Sharks. Tusker complete the rosta by taking on Chemelil at their home turf.
