West Pokot Governor John Lonyangapuo has invited the EACC to investigate and identify people conniving to steal public funds. Speaking in Kapenguria on Wednesday, Lonyangapuo said he had suspended the implementation of 23 projects to pave way for investigations. He invited the National Construction Authority immediately he resumed office to conduct an audit on ongoing projects started by his predecessor. “The authority has given us a damning report that showed the costs of most of the projects were highly infiltrated, work is halfway done, the workmanship is poor, but payment had already been made,” Lonyangapuo said. He said some of the contractors disregarded procurement laws, lacked professionalism and were awarded lucrative tenders they had no capacity to handle. “Many briefcase contractors emerged and were awarded contracts without  experience and valid documents,” Lonyangapuo said. He said the past government started numerous construction projects whose sole purpose was not to improve the lives of residents, but to enrich county officials through the arbitrary award of contracts and kickbacks. “A total of 23 projects have been analysed and none of them met the required standards of construction,” he said. Lonyangapuo said the public did not get value for money, adding that most contractors were not registered by the NCA. He urged the NCA to take action against the contractors.
