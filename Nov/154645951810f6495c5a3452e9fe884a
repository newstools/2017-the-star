Tuskys supermarket has invested Sh240 million in the
establishment of two new branches in Kisumu and Kisii, pushing its branch
network to 64 stores.  The two new premium branches with a cumulative shop floor
space of more than 40,000 square feet, will provide an expanded range of
economic benefits to the Nyanza region with direct and indirect employment,
expanded supply opportunities and wider market choice for customers. “At Tusker Mattresses, we remain committed to deepening the
formal retail market in East Africa and will continue to invest heavily on
customer experience and variety of products on our shelves to meet the dynamic
market needs,”  Tuskys Supermarket chief executive Dan Githua said.  The retailer will open Tuskys Echiro along Moi Avenue in
Kisii town and Tuskys Lolwe Supermarket at Mega Plaza to compliment operations
in existing Tuskys Chigware supermarket and Tuskys United Supermarket located
at United Mall, Kisumu.  Githua said the regional retail giant will also undertake
customer experience upgrades in all its branches.  “The opening of Kisii and Kisumu branches provides us with a
good opportunity to enhance our footprint and economic contribution in the fast
growing Nyanza region,” he said. The retailer’s current footprint includes 57 branches in
Kenya and seven in Uganda.
