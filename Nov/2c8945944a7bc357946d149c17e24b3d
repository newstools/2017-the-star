Twelve people died yesterday morning following a road accident at Salgaa, along the Nakuru-Eldoret highway. The 2am accident involved a matatu and a truck. "All the 11 passengers and the driver of the matatu died on the spot," Rongai OCPD Japheth Kioko said. The matatu belonged to the Great Rift Shuttle fleet. It was heading to Eldoret when it hit a cow and the driver lost control. It then collided head on with the truck which was moving in the opposite direction. A resident told the Star that several cows cross the road day and night at the notorious black spot. "The cows normally have no herder. They have caused several accidents in this area," he said. The truck driver and his turnboy suffered serious injuries. They were rushed to Nakuru Level Five Hospital. Bodies of the dead were taken to the hospital's mortuary. The accident happened amid calls by residents for the stretch to be redesigned to end frequent accidents. "We have been asking the government to create a dual carriage road to curb these crashes," resident Benard Sang said. Nakuru Deputy Governor Erick Korir said the Kenya National Highways Authority have set aside funds to construct a dual carriage lane along the road. "It is sad that our people continue to die on this road," Korir said. Korir said the county will collaborate with Kenha to help saves lives on the road.
