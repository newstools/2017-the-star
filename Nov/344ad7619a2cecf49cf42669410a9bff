The Pope has appointed Bishop Maurice Crowley of Kitale as the Apostolic Administrator of Eldoret Diocese. This follows the death of the Bishop of Eldoret, Rt Rev Cornelius Korir on October 30. The Pope’s representative to Kenya, Archbishop Charles Daniel Balvo, said may take time to find the right Bishop to replace Korir because of the nature of the process. The official communication was made through a letter dated November 22, and signed by the Apostolic Nuncio to Kenya and South Sudan, Archbishop Balvo. Bishop Crowley, 71 was appointed Bishop of Kitale on April 3, 1998. In his speech during the funeral of Bishop Korir, Archbishop Balvo said the late bishop had left him with something else to do: to look for his successor, which he called not an easy task. “Certainly in the next few days someone has to be appointed temporarily to guide and direct the diocese of Eldoret as we seek to find the person who will succeed Bishop Korir,” the Nuncio said. Bishop Korir was appointed Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Eldoret on April 27, 1990, and had served the diocese for 27 years until his demise. Korir died from diabetes and high blood pressure and was buried on November 11, in a tomb inside the Sacred Heart Cathedral in Eldoret.  It was a rare kind of burial never before witnessed in the region. The Catholic Diocese of Eldoret is situated in the Rift Valley Province of Kenya, on the western side of the Great Rift Valley. It was carved out of the Kisumu Diocese as the Apostolic Prefecture over 50 years ago on the Feast of St. Peter and Paul on June 29, 1953. The diocese was later subdivided three times, giving rise to the Nakuru, Kitale and Lodwar dioceses.
