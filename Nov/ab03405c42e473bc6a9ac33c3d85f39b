Senior Saudi Prince Miteb bin
Abdullah, a former National Guard head once seen as a contender
to the throne, has been freed after more than three weeks in
detention, according to Twitter messages by royal family members
on Tuesday. Miteb was among dozens of royal family members, ministers
and current and former senior officials who were rounded up in a
graft inquiry at least partly aimed at strengthening the power
of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. It was not immediately possible to confirm the reports of
his release and Saudi officials had no immediate comment. "Almighty, thanks be to you..." wrote Abeer bint Khaled bin
Abdullah in a posting on her Twitter account. Posting an
apparent file photo of Prince Miteb, she added: "May God give
you long life, long life full of health, and keep you for us." Writing on his Twitter account, Moaid Mahjoob, who
identifies himself as director of external relations for
Princess Jawahar Al-Saud, another Saudi royal family member,
said Prince Miteb "had been released and that he was at his home
in Riyadh". Another royal family member, Princes Nouf bint Abdullah bin
Mohammed bin Saud, also posted a similar message on Twitter,
writing over a photo of Prince Miteb: "May you be safe for us,
Abu Abdullah." The posting of a photo and thanksgiving to God indicates the
author of the Tweet believes Prince Miteb has been freed. Before he was sacked by a royal decree on November 4, Miteb
headed the Saudi National Guard, an elite internal security
force originally based on traditional tribal units that was run
by his father for five decades.
