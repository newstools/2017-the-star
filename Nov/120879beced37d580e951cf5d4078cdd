Migori residents yesterday held demonstrations, calling for seccession.  This followed the Supreme Court judgment that upheld President Uhuru Kenyatta’s October 26 win. Youths in Migori, Awendo, Rongo and Sori towns blocked roads with tyres and made bonfires to protest against the ruling. Early morning, businesses and PSVs started operations as normal, until the Supreme Court verdict was read, after which, they closed to avoid looting and destruction. Resident George Otoyo said locals do not recognise Uhuru’s win because six out of eight constituencies in the county did not take part in the October 26 repeat election. “As far was we are concerned, Migori county should secede from Kenya. We have been marginalised as a region since Independence,” Otoyo said. He said Migori county has been left out during resource allocation and development, adding the election was a ‘sham’. Residents barricaded major roads, including the Kisii-Migori highway and insisted they will only stop protests when NASA leader Raila Odinga gives them direction. They shouted slogans calling for seccession and urged the international community to investigate incidents of murder reported in Ruaraka, Nairobi county. In Migor, the main bridge that separates the town into two was a no-go zone and police stayed away from the area. Only Kuria East and West locals participated in the repeat election. Rongo, Uriri, Awendo, Nyatike, Suna East and West snubbed the exercise. At least two people were reported dead and several suffered gunshot wounds and were assaulted by police during protests.
