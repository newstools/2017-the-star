Farmers whose land has been earmarked for the establishment of a Sh21 billion wind power project in Baharini, Mpeketoni, have urged the investors to speed up compensation. A total of 3,206 acres have been acquired at Baharini and 600 farmers are expected to be compensated. The Baharini Wind Power project is a collaboration between Elicio, a Belgium firm, and Kenyan company Kenwind Holdings Limited. The project is expected to generate 90MW of electricity. Yesterday, the landowners, most of whom are farmers, said they need to be compensated so they can look for alternative accommodation. They wondered why the compensation has dragged, yet all the necessary procedures, including land assessment, have been done and approved. Landowners’ spokesman Linus Gachoki said compensation should be done or they be allowed back to their property until the investors are ready to pay. He said it is unfair for farmers not to have access to their land, yet they have not yet been compensated. “The land was acquired over two years ago. Since then, many of us haven’t farmed as we wait for them to pay us so we can buy alternative land and continue earning a livelihood. But nothing is forthcoming. It’s a tough situation to be in,” Gachoki said. Investors announced they would conduct the environmental and social impact assessment study in July. The assessment was meant to determine the feasibility of the project. Addressing farmers in the Baharini area during the launch of the ESIA study, project director Susan Nandwa said the study will not only enable them understand the scope of the project, but also help narrow down on the impacts and effects. She urged residents to cooperate with the experts, who would engage them.
