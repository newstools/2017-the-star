A widow committed suicide in Rarieda after finding out her pastor and lover was also sleeping with her form three daughter. The death occurred in Magombe village. According to residents, the woman’s body was found hanging from a mango tree near her house yesterday morning. This is after she discovered a pastor of her church, whom she has been dating, was also in a relationship with her daughter who is in form three. The woman’s inlaws were at a loss about how they would cleanse the mother and daughter. Villagers were shocked to find the woman’s body dangling from a tree. East Uyoma chief Wilberforce Oyucho said the relationships had set tongues wagging. He said investigations will be done to ascertain the reason why the woman decided to take her life. Oyucho said the woman’s body has  taken to Madiany Subcounty Hospital Mortuary for an autopsy. The love triangle is an abomination according to the Luo culture.  Cleansing is usually done using traditional herbs commonly known as “manyas”, according to the villagers.
