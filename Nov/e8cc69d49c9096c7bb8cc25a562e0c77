At least 16 people have been murdered over the weekend in Nairobi. Some were shot in the head or chest and others attacked with pangas. It is unacceptable and a big shame that Kenya should lose so many people to what the police are calling "unknown gunmen". This madness in the capital city must end with immediate effect. It stokes memories of the post-election crisis of a decade ago in which 1,300 died and 600,000 were displaced in the Rift Valley. The effects on the economy were terrible. Communities must not fight or attack other communities, anywhere in Kenya. The role of the National Police Service is critically important. The police must protect the innocent and in the course of doing so they must not become perpetrators of violence. It is time for both President Uhuru Kenyatta and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga to demonstrate leadership and unite, not disunite, Kenyans. Divisive politics are deadly. It is time the top national leaders put aside their ambitions and placed Kenya first.
