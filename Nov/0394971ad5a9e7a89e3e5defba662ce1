Webuye human rights activist Moses Lukoye has petitioned for the removal members of Bungoma Public Service Board. Lukoye filed a petitioned against six board members on September 31 and wants the board established by former Governor Ken Lusaka sacked for lack of integrity. They include the board chairman Gideon Sirai , members Janet Manyasi, Elizabeth Wanyonyi, Peter Masengeli, Steven Wesonga and Bonvenja Wasikoyo. Lukoye has also accused the board of incompetence and violating oath of office and the Constitution. The hearing began on Monday at KIE in Bungoma town under the county assembly’s Public Administration Committee chaired by Naitiri Kabuyefwe ward MCA Joan Lutukayi Lukoye and his two witnesses, Mercy Nekesa and John Khaoya, finished their submissions on Monday before the committee. Nekesa, a casual worker at the county since 2013 said that she did not understand why the board had refused to employ her as permanent worker all this time. She said labour laws had clearly stated former local government workers would be absorbed by the county government during the transition period. Janet Manyasi is accused of receiving double salary from the Exchequer as a lecturer at Masinde Muliro University and as a full employee of the PSB, contrary to law. Lukoyes is represented by lawyer Nickson Sifuna while the board is represented by Shifwoka Shikuti.
