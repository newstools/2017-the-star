The Association For The Physically Disabled of Kenya, Embu, has criticised the increase of sexual abuse against the disabled. Chairman Stephen Kathambara yesterday said there have been reports of people taking advantage of the disabled, especially girls, who get raped. The deaf and mute are especially vulnerable because they cannot be call for help. Kathambara said the criminals also target the mute since even if they are arrested, the victims cannot speak up. He urged the courts to take extra care when hearing such cases. Speaking in Embu town yesterday, Kathambara said the courts need to follow the cases carefully to ensure suspects are convicted. Some months ago a mentally challenged man died after allegedly being sodomized in Ndiu village, Embu East subcounty. His attacker was allegedly punishing him for pouring beer on him accidentally. Witnesses said the bar patron was agitated and frog marched the deceased out of the pub. The 45-year-old man died while under treatment at Runyenjes Subcounty Hospital.
