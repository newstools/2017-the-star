The new technology adopted in the administration of the KCPE examination is proving to be an asset to Knec after it recorded zero cases of malpractice this year. The new technology was acquired by the Ministry of Education in collaboration with the Information ministry. The accuracy of the examination stands at 99.98 per cent. It took three weeks to mark and release the results. The measures adopted in this year’s examination marked an advancement in credibility, safety and accuracy. Introduced in this year’s examination, personalised answer sheets eased the feeding of data for individual students. The answer sheets contained barcodes which centre managers were expected to scan when packing and sending back materials. The two features were aimed at preventing changes to answer sheet scripts. “We can now unequivocally state that the government has all it takes to administer an error-free, transparent and credible national examination – with meticulous planning and committed staff who operate with high levels of integrity,” Education CS Fred Matiang’i said during the release of the 2017 KCPE results in Nairobi yesterday. The council bought 20 scanning machines for marking scripts at a cost of Sh100 million. This was meant to reduce human interaction with candidates’ results. The optical mark readers replaced the old machines procured 17 years ago. Knec chairman George Magoha said the new machines deliver results quickly - they mark batches of between 100 and 200 sheets and roll multiple answer sheets on both sides, unlike the previous technology, which took many hours and marked fewer copies. The details of the 1,003,556 candidates were captured in the scanners with images of the marked script retained and saved in the system.
