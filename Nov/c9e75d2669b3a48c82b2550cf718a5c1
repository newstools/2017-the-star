Human rights activist Emma Mbura has opposed the government’s plan to lift the ban on export of Kenyan domestic workers to Saudi Arabia and Qatar. The former Jubilee nominated senator said Kenya has not demonstrated it has adequate measures to protect its domestic workers in the Gulf countries. “There’s no single case the government has followed up to ensure justice is served for victims of torture at the hands of brutal employers,” Mbura (pictured) told the Star on the phone on Friday. “I’m not against Kenyans going to the Gulf nations to seek employment. My issue is: What has been done to ensure their safety?” Last week, Labour CS Phylis Kandie said she will lift the ban next week. She said the ministry adopted new rules and measures “to curb mistreatment of Kenyan workers in the countries”. The measures include pre-departure training for those wishing to travel to the Middle East.
