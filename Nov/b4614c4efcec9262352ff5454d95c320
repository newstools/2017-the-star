Two children
are feared dead while the bodies of an elderly couple were found after floods occasioned by heavy rains in North Horr, Marsabit county. The bodies of Jillo Korme and his wife Shane were found on Tuesday evening after a two-day search by residents and Kenya Red Cross officials. Deputy Governor Solomon Gubo said they were searching for the children. Gubo said 360 bags of rice, 130 bags of maize and beans, maize flour, blankets and mattresses were distributed to affected residents. He added they wrote to the Roads ministry to open up some of the affected routes.Â He said the county government has deployed a bulldozer to Laisamis to help remove mud covering most of the roads. "We are
holding an emergency meeting to plan how to deliver relief food. This is an
emergency," Gubo added. He said hundreds fled from their homes as rainfall intensified. County commissioner Meru Mwangi lauded 31 resident volunteers and Kenya Red Cross for their search and rescue efforts. "We appreciate the concerted efforts of local youths. We are experiencing heavy rains that have paralysed transport," he said. He asked residents to move to higher ground as the government begins to distribute relief food and medication. Jirme,
Nagayo, Dakarbicha and Mountain are some of the most affected areas,
according to a report by Kenya Red Cross Society. Related: Kwale residents ask for relief food after rain wreaks havoc
