The fate of Musingu Boys’ High School principal hangs in balance after suspected collusion in the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education was detected in the school last week. The principal, Elphas Libasu, has been sidelined. The exams have taken over by Ikolomani subcounty education officer Hillary Kirech. Yesterday, the principal denied there was a problem in the school. Police were sent to the school last Thursday after angry candidates stoned and chased away the boarding master. Trouble started on Tuesday when two Kenya National Examinations Council officials went to the school and walked straight to the exam rooms. They found candidates with “strange papers” and text books. The officials did find supervisors. Officials from the Kakamega county education office said a new set of invigilators was dispatched to the school.  “The Ikolomani DEO is acting as principal and the subcounty quality assurance officer is the acting supervisor for the centre,” said an official, who declined to be named. Western regional education cordinator Nereah Olick addressed candidates on Friday. She, however, declined to comment on the the principal. She referred journalists to Education Principal Secretary Bellio Kipsang.
