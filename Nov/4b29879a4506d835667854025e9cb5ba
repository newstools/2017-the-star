NASA supporters yesterday attacked two journalists during a parliamentary group meeting at Wiper offices in Nairobi. Royal Media’s Francis Gachuri was roughed up and threatened, while an NTV videographer was slapped. They were rescued by other journalists — some walked out of the meeting to show their support. NASA leadership condemned the assault and apologised to the reporters and their media houses. ODM communications director Philip Etale said party leader Raila Odinga was “not amused at all”. “I must say what I saw was unfortunate, barbaric and archaic. On behalf of NASA, I apologise for the attack on my brother Gachuri and on my sister Jane. I’m very disturbed,” he said. Raila’s spokesman Dennis Onyango said in a statement that NASA was “deeply disturbed by the incident”. “We wish to make it clear that the youth acted on their own and we condemn their actions in the strongest terms possible,” he said, adding NASA will probe so culprits can be punished. “The coalition registers unreserved apology to reporters who fell victim to this unfortunate incident.” ICT CS Joe Mucheru, journalists and other media stakeholders said it was barbaric and urged NASA to take action against the youths. Mucheru said his ministry will work with the Interior ministry to investigate “so perpetrators can face the full force of the law”. “The Constitution guarantees the media the freedom to exercise their right. It is unacceptable for NASA supporters to contravene this provision,” he said in a statement. “As the CS responsible for the media sector, I condemn this act and assure the media that the government will continue to ensure their right to perform their duties in accordance with the law is protected.” Reports indicated the attack was motivated by Citizen’s setup of a tallying centre, which NASA supporters say was influenced by the Jubilee administration to validate the eventual rerun results announced by the IEBC.
