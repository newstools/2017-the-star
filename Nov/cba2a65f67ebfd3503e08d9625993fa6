Rich kid Anerlisa Muigai has style and class. She has a taste for the finer things in life. She owns what many women would die for. A state-of-the-art shoe collection.  Anerlisa recently told men she is not about the broke lifestyle, and if you are thirsting for her, you must be filthy rich. No doubt! It turns out the Keroche Breweries heiress has been importing shoes from the famous Salvatore Ferragamo designs. She has at least 25 pairs of the Manolo Blahnik designs. A pair costs a little over Sh175,000, which means all 25 pairs of shoes total about Sh4.3 million.  On the other hand, she has 10 Ferragamo designs. One shoe costs Sh55 thousand, adding up to over half a million shillings. Now, the entire collection costs a little over a cool Sh5 million.
