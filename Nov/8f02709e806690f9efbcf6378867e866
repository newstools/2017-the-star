The family of the late Naivasha rancher Tom Cholmondeley has reached an out-of-court settlement with a hospital it had accused of holding his medical records.  High Court judge Chacha Mwita was on Friday told that Hugh George Cholmondeley has settled the dispute with MP Shah Hospital. Tom died on August 17, 2016, while recuperating at the Intensive Care Unit of the hospital.  He had undergone a hip replacement surgery. Tom was buried at his family’s Soysambu Ranch in Naivasha.  George went to court in October, accusing the hospital of failing to release his medical records. He had told the court that Tom’s medical records had not been released to them and the postmortem report was inconclusive.  He said this made it impossible for the family to get a death certificate. But a letter tabled before court on Friday suggests the hospital has agreed to release Tom’s file within seven days. According to the letter from Iseme Kamau and Muema Advocates, George has also been appointed the next of kin to the late farmer for purposes of the petition.  He had sought a declaration that the hospital violated their rights by denying them hospital records. He had also sought to be paid damages for the said violation.  The letter before court did not however say if the family had settled on the damages. The case was, however, withdrawn.
