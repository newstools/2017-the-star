After a five-month strike the nurses’ uniform and nursing allowances have finally been raised. The nurses yesterday evening called off their strike after a “lengthy day” of negotiations that finally yielded a deal. “Today we decided to meet and discuss this matter and get a consensus going forward. We have a deal. We have reached a consensus between the Government of Kenya and the nurses’ union,” Council of Governors chairman Josphat Nanok said. The nurses have been fighting for a risk allowance of Sh15,400 per month, extraneous allowance of Sh5,000 per month and uniform allowance to be increased to Sh50,000 per year from the current Sh10,000 per year. The nurses will take home a uniform allowance of Sh15,000, which will be increased annually by Sh5,000 over a period of three years. However, this will be factored in the 2018-19 financial year to allow the government to get its house in order. This means in 2019-20, the allowance to be paid will be Sh20,000 and in 2020-21 the nurses will get Sh25,000. The nurses are paid Sh10,000 uniform allowance and Sh20,000 nursing allowance. Nanok said the nurses will be paid Sh23,000 nursing service allowance in the 2018-19 financial year. This will be increased by Sh 3,500 in 2019-20 and a further Sh3,500 in 2020-21 to make it Sh30,000. “Within 30 days of singing this agreement, the CBA shall be concluded and signed,” Nanok said. He said all the disciplinary cases filed against the nurses will be withdrawn. All withheld salaries will be paid by the end of November and not later than December 31. Nanok said the only court case that will not be withdrawn is the one on grading structures. He urged the union to call off the strike immediately and the nurses to report to work “immediately or not later than the close of business today”. Health CS Cleopa Mailu said Treasury and the SRC will be engaged to register the CBA. Nanok said, “I know skeleton staff have been working at respective institutions which has not been adequate. I know the gap which was left since June and foretold suffering to Kenyans, and indeed that is regrettable.” Kisii Governor James Ongwae, the chairman of the Human Resource, Labour and Social Welfare Committee, said the deal would be implemented to the letter. The government had threatened to sack striking nurses, saying the strike was unlawful.
