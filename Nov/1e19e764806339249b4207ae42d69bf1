The Malindi High Court yesterday struck out two petitions challenging the election of MPs in Kilifi county. Two more Members of
Parliament from Kilifi County were on Tuesday cleared by the high court which struck
petitions filed against them by Jubilee party. High Court Judge Dorah Chepkwony dismissed petitions
against Kaloleni MP Paul Katana and Kilifi South's Ken Chonga. The two petitions had been filed by voters. They were dismissed separately. Chepkwony ordered
the petitioners - Samuel Mulwa and Suleiman Kaingu - to pay Sh1 million each in damages. Chepkwony said the petitions
were defective. In the fist case against Katana, Chepkwony said two
petitions bearing the same date had been attached. She said there was
evidence that the petitioner swapped the second petition with the first one. Chepkwony said the
petitioner could only amend the petition with the leave of the court as
required by law. The petitioners never sought the leave. The second petition was dismissed because it was incompetent. Chepkwony said it had anomalies. Kaingu, a resident of
Kilifi South, had
accused the IEBC and constituency returning officer Neema Karisa of committing illegalities during the election. The two are the latest petitions to be struck out by the Malindi court. Others are those challenging the election on Senator Steward Madzayo, Woman Representative Gertrude Mwanyanje and Ganze MP Teddy Mwambire. Katana and Chonga, both of ODM, were declared winners in their constituencies after beating Gunga Mwinga of Devolution Party and Mustapha Idd of Jubilee respectively.
