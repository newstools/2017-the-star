The High Court in Eldoret has allowed a poll petition against Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter to proceed to full hearing with a new petitioner after a voter who filed the petition withdrew. Bernard Kitur, who emerged second with 13,872 votes, is the new petitioner. He has replaced voter Robert Kemei — the Citizen’s Voice and Action chairman in Nandi. Justice George Kimondo allowed Kitur to use the Sh500,000 security fee he had deposited on behalf of Kemei, after he applied to take over as petitioner. Kemei said residents and his family prevailed upon him to withdraw. The case is set for pretrial mention on November 29.
