 Environment CS Judi Wakhungu yesterday presided over the official aerial count of elephants, buffaloes, Grevy’s Zebras and giraffes in Northern Kenya. The US provided $150,200 (Sh15,589,092 ) to support the survey. Wakhungu said the goal of this year’s survey is to sustain the long-term monitoring of the species. “The objective of the count is to establish the elephant, buffalo, giraffe and Grevy’s zebra population, establish elephant poaching levels and counting carcasses in the ecosystem, changes in population size and their distribution since the last survey in 2012,” the CS said at Sarova Shaba Lodge. The census will cover 60,000 square kilometres for seven days. Fourteen aircraft will be used. The exercise which will cover Laikipia-Samburu-Meru-Marsabit ecosystem, started on Sunday and will end on November 30. The ecosystem is among Kenya’s greatest wildlife conservation areas. The CS, who was flanked by her PS Margaret Mwakima, said the information generated will be used to guide policy issues in the conservation and management of wildlife, corridor development and human-wildlife conflicts.  The survey will help assess the animals’ survival prospects in the face of various pressures.
