Baringo county assembly endorsed 10 executives despite pressure from the public. There was heated debate over the qualifications of nominees for Environment, Natural Resources, Tourism and Wildlife Scolah Kimeli and Enterprise and Cooperative Development Clement Lomaringoria. Mochongoi MCA Kipruto Kimosop defended Kimeli. He was backed by Solomon Makal (Kolowa), Jeniffer Kabon (Kapropita), Nelson Loteia (Silale) Reuben Chepsongol (Bartabwa), John Aengwo (Saimo-Kipsaraman) and Ameja Zelemoi( Churo-Amaya). The motion was criticised by Francisca Cheburet (nominated). “There’re more qualified people who applied for the post,” she said. Although Kimeli graduated with first class honors in Business Management from Moi University, the public felt she did not articulate issues well. She had difficulty answering questions during vetting on October 25. Baringo Civil Society Organisations’ Forum, led by Isaiah Biwott, disputed the outcome.  “If the assembly can clear such unsuitable people, there is no need for vetting,” he said. When asked to name basic human resources in the county, they nominee listed zebras, murrum and manganese. “She was complaining about Zebras destroying her maize instead of convincing the panel why she should be should be trust her to head the department,” Biwott said. He was flanked colleagues Moses Lemeluk and Godfrey Kipsoi. They also criticised Lomaringoria’s endorsement.  He didn’t have his original university degree certificate from the University of Minnesota, USA. He only presented his form four certificate and a P1 teacher certificate. The lobby also criticised the MCAs for attacking the media for exposing the truth about the nominees. The other nominees cleared are Thomas ole Nongonop (Education), Dr Maureen Rotich (Devolution), Elijah Kipkoros (Lands), Mary Panga (Health), Dr David Chesire (Finance), Dr Richard Rotich (Agriculture), Dr Joel Koima (Water).
