Kisumu East MP Shakeel Shabbir yesterday condemned Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o and city manager Doris Ombara for relocating the Kachok dumpsite to his constituency.  Kachok is near Moi Stadium in the Central Business District “I will not allow relocation of the dumpsite. It will not happen, over my dead body. If they want to kill me, let them kill me,” Shabbir told reporters. Ombara said the relocation will cost Sh99.3million. She said Sh19,850 will be paid for each of the 5,000 trips to Kajulu. Ombara said the new site is a five-acre quarry owned by Naya Holding Limited. Shabbir said the county government should adopt an integrated garbage management system like that in Germany and Kampala before relocating. Nyong’o flagged off the trucks transporting the waste on Saturday.  He said proper environment studies were done before approval by the National Environment Management Authority.  Moving the dumpsite is one of the major projects Nyong’o pledged to undertake in his first 100 days in office. “We got the best advice from environment experts from the University of Nairobi. Nothing will go wrong,” he said. Ombara said plastic material has been put at the bottom to prevent penetration of the waste into the soil. She said experts were used to establish toxicity levels.  But Shabbir said there was no public participation and a proper environmental assessment should be done. The third-term MP said he won’t allow the shift to take place if county fails to follow due process. Nyong’o and Ombara should avoid shortcuts, Shabbir said.  “My constituents gave me votes as an independent. They rejected the ODM candidate,” he said, adding he would not let them down. Nyong’o said those complaining don’t understand what they’re doing. Kisumu Senator Fred Outa and the county assembly speaker Onyango Oloo back the relocation.
