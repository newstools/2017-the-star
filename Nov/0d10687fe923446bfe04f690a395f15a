The government will use choppers to ferry exam materials to schools in flooded areas, Knec chairman George Magoha has promised. He spoke yesterday at Murang’a High School, where he inspected the start of the KCSE exam.  He said choppers have been dispatched and “will deliver the exam to all schools that are not accessible by road”. Wajir, Turkana and some parts of the coastal region have been completely cut off by floods. In Murang’a, the exam started without hitches as secondary school heads braved heavy rains to collect exam papers for their schools. Magoha said politicians who disrupt the examination will be punished. “We are warning politicians not to engage in picketing or demonstrations near schools,” he added. The exam is a national exercise and protests near schools may hurt students’ concentration, Magoha said. “Interfering with this exercise is interfering with the future if this country. It will not be allowed,” he said. Students must have enough space to sit the exam, as they have no political affiliations, he added. Murang’a county commissioner John Elung’ata said security will be strengthened in schools to ensure the exam runs smoothly. “Despite the downpour this morning, all exam centres have started the exercise without hurdles,” he added. The county has 333 examination centres and 24,699 candidates.
