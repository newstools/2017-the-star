Jubilee has said it will form parliamentary committees next week without NASA legislators if they fail to submit names of their members. National Assembly Majority leader Aden Duale yesterday told the Star on the phone Jubilee will not allow NASA to hold Parliament “hostage”. “I have already forwarded the list for the Selection Committee to be discussed on Wednesday next week and thereafter constitute all relevant committees,” he said. MPs resume from their short November recess next Tuesday. Both Houses are expected to go on a 10-week holiday from December 8 up to February 12, 2018. House Speakers Justin Muturi (National Assembly) and Kenneth Lusaka (Senate) received communication from NASA chief executive officer Norman Magaya assuring them the coalition will submit the list by November 30. Magaya told the Star NASA is dealing with serious issues concerning Kenya’s leadership and coming up with a House leadership list is not top on their agenda. He said NASA will submit its list to Parliament before the proposed date once the coalition’s co-principals and party leaders Raila (ODM), Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper), Moses Wetang’ula (Ford Kenya) and Musalia Mudavadi (ANC) meet and agree. “These are mundane issues that are not on our priority list now. We will forward the names once we are ready,” Magaya said. NASA has already filled the positions of Minority leader in both Houses. Wetang’ula is the Senate minority leader, while his National Assembly counterpart is Suba South MP John Mbadi. The coalition is supposed to fill the deputy Minority leaders, the chief whip and deputies in addition to chairs of two powerful watchdog units - Public Accounts and Public Investment committees.
