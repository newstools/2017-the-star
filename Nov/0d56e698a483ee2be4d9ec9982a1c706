Two Kajiado executive nominees impressed the assembly’s vetting team with their masterly of language and understanding of the dockets. Jackline Koin (Tourism and Wildlife) mesmerised assembly vetting committee members when answering questions how she will handle human-wildlife conflict in her docket. Koin, who earlier described herself in her introduction as a woman of integrity, said she faces issues with reality and explained that human-wildlife conflicts are creation of human beings. Before Koin was vetted, Samuel Seki, who is governor Joseph Lenku’s nominee for Education, explained why he resigned from a senior county position. Seki explained he comes from Kajiado and that his understanding is that a position of a county secretary is lower than that of an executive because of its responsibilities.
