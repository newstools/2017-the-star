Moi University has handed its report on interviews for the vice chancellor post to Education CS Fred Matiang'i. University Council chairman Jeremiah Ntoloi submitted the report on Thursday amid claims of bribery and ethnic bias. The claim is that the aim was to block acting Vice
Chancellor Laban Ayiro from taking over in full capacity. Ntoloi declined to comment on the claims but he led several council
members in handing over the report and discussing the university's state with Matiang'i. Sources said they discussed scenarios under the leadership of either one of the candidates. Debate was rife at the university following claims that some of the interviewers tried to sabotage Ayiro despite his performance. Kosgey, who has been deputy VC at Laikipia University, scored 76 marks while Ayiro and professor Ann Nangulu came second with 70 points each. Professor Maurice Amutabi scored 66 marks, Isaac Kibwage 64 and Joseph Chacha 61.

"A recruitment process that is marred by claims of bribery and ethnic wars, to lock out some individual, is not acceptable at all." Matiangi is expected to name a new VC in two weeks time should the results be upheld. Click here for the latest political news
