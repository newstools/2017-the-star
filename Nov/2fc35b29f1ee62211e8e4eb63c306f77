A season that threatened to implode midstream is finally coming together for Posta Rangers as they took over second spot in the SportPesa Premier League standings after a run of seven matches without defeat. The converse was the story when Sammy Omollo’s mailmen were still in contention for the title and had gone twelve matches without victory but that run of more than a dozen matches without victory is a classic glass half full or half empty inquisition. Sunday’s goalless draw against Bandari saw them move behind Gor Mahia on the table with 50 points ahead of Tusker on goal difference. The brewers succumbed to a Eugene Mukangula’s goal for relegation-threatened Thika United to slip a place down to third. Sofapaka lost 1-0 away to Sony Sugar. Congolese striker Mwana Yema returned to the score sheets after close to two months with the all-important goal in the first half. Credit for the assist goes to long serving Sony forward Victor Ademba. With this result, Sony made a late entry into the fight for the top 10 league spot. Sofapaka with 49 points dropped to fourth place on the log with two games left to play. Kakamega Homeboyz close the top five also with 49 points after their dramatic 2-2 draw against Chemelil Sugar.With Muhoroni Youth already relegated, attention now turns to the two teams who will join them out of the top flight league. New boys Zoo Kericho and Nakumatt are not yet out of the woods despite sitting just outside the relegation zone. The two sides’ recent results have meant that with only two matches left for the 2017 campaign to come to a conclusion, only five points separate them from the last automatic relegation spot currently occupied by Western Stima. From 32 matches, Zoo have 37 points while Nakumatt, beaten 1-0 by AFC Leopards, are on 36 points. Mathare and Thika United who enjoyed 1-0 wins over Nzoia United and Tusker respectively are on 35 points with Stima on 33.
