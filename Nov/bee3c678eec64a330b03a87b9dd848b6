A KCSE candidate in Migori county died on Saturday, a day after rehearsals for the national high school examinations. Basil Omondi, 18, collapsed at the gate of Migori Complex Secondary School on his way for revision. "He was admitted immediately at Oruba Nursing Home where he died while undergoing treatment. He had been diagnosed with acute malaria and typhoid," said Omondi's father Francis Ogama. His mother Grace Akinyi said he managed to go to school on Friday for the rehearsals. "He came back in the evening and was jovial but complained of fatigue. He left for school the next morning but we were later called with the bad news." The parents described their son as an active student who was a member of the drama club and music and handball teams. School principal Edwin Agere said Omondi was released on Friday so he could seek treatment as he complained about a severe headache. "We had consulted the supervisor on taking the examinations to the hospital in case his condition worsened. This is very sad." Two other candidates - from Kadika and Dede Girls' secondary schools - wrote their examinations at St Joseph and Migori Referral hospitals respectively on Monday. Migori education officer Luka Kagogo said the process in all eight constituencies had been smooth. "Nyatike is expansive and has three centres. The process was smooth despite the higher number of candidates," he said at St Joseph Ntimaru Secondary School. Kagogo said 1,228 more students registered this year and that last year's number was 14,785. Migori has 259 centres, 26 more than last year, which shows "transition rates from primary to secondary are increasing".
