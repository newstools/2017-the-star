A court yesterday lifted the arrest warrant against Kisumu Senator Fred Outa and former Deputy Governor Ruth Odinga for non-appearance. Chief magistrate Julius Ng’arng’ar warned the two – who were in court – the warrant should serve as a warning. He issued the warrant on Monday after Outa and Odinga failed to show up in court for the mention of their case. Advocate Verah Onsongo told the court Outa could not be reached on the phone, while Odinga was unwell. The two face five charges. They are accused of entering an electoral centre on October 23 without permission, obstructing an election officer from executing lawful duties, contrary to the Election Offences Act, and malicious damage of property. They have denied the charges and are out on Sh500,000 bond each with no surety. Yesterday Outa and Odinga told Ng’arng’ar they were not being disobedient, but failed to turn up on Monday due to circumstances beyond their control. Lawyer Geoffrey Yogo told the court Odinga, who is hypertensive, was hospitalised on Sunday after her pressure shot up. She could not walk. “By nighttime her condition had stabilised and we are waiting for the doctor to discharge her,” he said. Yogo requested an extension of 30 minutes to give Ruth time to be discharged from hospital. He said Outa had missed his flight following a breakdown on the Southern Bypass and had to travel by road. Prosecutor Jacinta Nyamosi said the medical cards produced by the defence lawyers looked genuine and their explanation sounded logical, and asked the warrant be lifted. She said the next time the matter comes up for hearing, they had better appear. “I consider the application to lift the warrant, and next time take these matters seriously,” Ng’arng’ar said. The case will be mentioned on November 28.
