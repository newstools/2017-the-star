Mohamed Maro, famously known as Kasuku bin Kicheko, has urged people living with disability to avoid begging and instead use their talent to earn a living. Famously known for mimicking the voice of former President Daniel Moi, especially in the past comedy show Redykyulass, the comedian can also mimic opposition leader Raila Odinga and many other popular personalities. Maro urged parents not to hide away their disabled kids "but instead take them out to have fun." The comedian was born blind, but this has never stopped him from hustling. He used his knack to make people laugh to earn a living. Speaking to Word Is, he said, "They can decide to form a choir, sing in front of people and when the crowds like their performance, they could be called to different events instead of begging in the streets." A father of nine, Kasuku bin Kicheko says he has nothing to complain and whine about, and thanks God for every day he lives. Maro remembers his best performance was at a hotel in Ukunda where he earned Sh160,000. He also recalls performing for President Uhuru Kenyatta in the year 1995 at a Kanu meeting. "People like my performance because whenever I'm billed to headline a show, I always manage to pull in huge crowds. That is humbling," he said. Kasuku urged people to never give up in life as God is there to listen to the prayers of every single one.
