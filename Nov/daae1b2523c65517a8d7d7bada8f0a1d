For the second year in a row, Kenya has won the Miss World Africa title, this time through Magline Jeruto, who was crowned at a colourful Miss World Gala last Saturday in Sanya, China.  Magline, who previously held the Miss Elgeyo Marakwet title, beat other beauties to the top five spot in the global event, which drew more than 118 global queens. She takes over from Evelyn Njambi, the 2016 title holder.  Speaking during her reception at the airport, Miss World Kenya Franchise director Terry Mungai congratulated her, and affirmed that the country's win increased Kenya's chances of hosting the global fete.  "In spite of the odds that she faced, including limited preparation time, lack of adequate financial assistance and a new cultural experience, her star shone bright. Kenyans rallied behind her and she in turn brought out the best reflection of Kenya to the world," Terry said.  Adding, "This victory not only cements Kenya's beauty positioning in the world and atop Africa, but also sets a benchmark for future successors to follow. We leverage these victories to lobby for the opportunity to host the competition in our country."  Kenya has previously done well in the Miss World competitions, moreso in the Beauty with a Purpose Category. This attracts the reigning Miss World to visit the country and support the good cause. Miss World Kenya Idah Nguma invited Miss World 2015 Mireia Lalaguna to Kenya to support Smile Train, a charity that carries out reconstructive surgeries on cleft lift and palate patients.
