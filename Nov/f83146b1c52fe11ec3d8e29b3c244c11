A man was attacked by irate locals in Marakwet West for attempting to kill himself and his child in a house fire. Residents said Kenneth Lotikamba locked himself and his young daughter in their house in Kaptabuk village and set it ablaze. A crowd broke into the house and attacked him using machetes as he started burning the house from inside. Villager Elias Rotich narrated that the father resorted to this action after returning from work on Thursday night. "The child's mother raised the alarm and neighbours arrived on time," he said, adding Lotikamba attempted to chase his neighbours away but that they overpowered him. The man sustained serious arm and leg injuries and was rushed to Kapsowar Mission Hospital, Rotich said on Saturday. The neighbour said Lotikamba often quarreled with his wife and that these episodes may have triggered his drastic action. Marakwet West police boss Apollo Onyonyi said investigations were launched and that the man will record a statement once he recovers. Noting many family feuds had been reported, Onyonyi urged locals to resolve them with the help of community elders. In one of the disputes in the area, a 48-year-old man was attacked and seriously wounded in Sitoton village in Marakwet West. Joseph Chelimo spent more than a week at Kapsowar Mission Hospital after the axe attack that his wife was accused of. Click here for the latest political news
