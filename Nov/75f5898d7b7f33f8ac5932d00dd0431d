Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati on Saturday warned his County Public Service Board against taking bribes from those seeking Chief Officers positions. Speaking at a burial service in Kanduyi, Wangamati said he was aware that some people have paid up to Sh50,000 to members of the Board. "Such corruption will not be entertained and only those who merit will be allowed to serve in my government," Governor Wangamati said. The Board is currently holding interviews for the 15 slots of Chief Officers. Successful officers will be appointed in another one week He also defended his list of CEC nominees as fairly representative. Sections of Teso community had earlier dismissed the list arguing that their supposed slot had been given to a Nairobi Pharmacist and Sports enthusiast Dr Antony Walela.
