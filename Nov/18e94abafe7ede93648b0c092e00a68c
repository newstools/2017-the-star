The Vihiga county assembly on Thursday passed a motion to establish a People’s Assembly in the county in line with the push by NASA. The motion seeks a repeat presidential election to be held in February. Wodanga MCA Vincent Astiaya criticised local leaders who did not attend the session. “I am an independent MCA but I am here to support this motion. It is very sad that our elected leaders are not here. How busy are they compared to Siaya Senator James Orengo, who has found time to be with us here today?” Atsiaya said. All five Vihiga county MPs, senator and woman representative skipped the session.  The motion was introduced for debate in the 38-member assembly by majority leader Wycliffe Masini and seconded by majority whip Victor Ijaika. Masini said the motion is agitating for electoral justice, a demand being fronted by NASA leader Raila Odinga. Vihiga Governor Wilbur Ottichilo, Orengo, former Machakos Senator Johnston Muthama, former Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale and Kakamega Senator Cleopas Malala attended the session. The sitting was largely boycotted by the minority Progressive Party of Kenya led by former Vihiga Governor Moses Akaranga. Nominated MP Godfrey Osotsi, Mathare MP Anthony Oluoch and Miguna Miguna also attended. Masini said, “This motion aims at correcting mistakes committed by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission in the presidential elections held on August 8 and October 26.” He said the presidential elections were null and void and cannot give President Uhuru Kenyatta the mandate to govern Kenya. “In Vihiga, more than 279,000 people did not participate in the polls. We stand with the majority.”
