Leaders should preach peace instead of recklessly inciting ethnic hatred, Kiambu politician Gladys Chania has said. Speaking in Limuru on Friday, she said the election is still fresh in people's minds and urged politicians to be cautious when they make public addresses. Chania urged political leaders to foster coexistence. “Our leaders should try their level best to show the common people that we need each other. We have to live together,” Chania, a psychologist, said. “We were brought up in peaceful environment, and we should create a conducive environment where our children will grow appreciating each other.” She warned leaders they will be judged harshly by future generations, and urged them to leave a legacy that will be respected by many. “We must be role models. Let us not be an example of failed and unfocused leaders who will be judged by many in future,” Chania said. She urged Kenyans to wait for the Supreme Court ruling on the petition challenging President Uhuru Kenyatta's win in the October 26 repeat election. Chania urged Kenyans, including politicians, to pray for the country and to unite to maintain peace. She asked the opposition NASA to respect the Constitution and the presidency.
