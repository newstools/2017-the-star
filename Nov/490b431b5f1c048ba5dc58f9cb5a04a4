Former cabinet minister Gilbert M'Mbijiwe died on Wednesday night at Kirua mission hospital after a long battle with throat cancer. M'Mbijiwe,91, served as minister for Agriculture, Energy and Health respectively during former President Daniel arap Moi's regime. During the period, he was the  MP for Meru Central and South Imenti Constituency. M'Mbijiwe, also known as Kabere, was the first South Imenti MP under KANU, a term that began in 1988. He was trounced by Kiraitu Murungi, who was then in opposition party Ford Kenya, in 1992. Kiraitu, who is now Meru Governor, eulogised M'Mbijiwe as a hero who was passionate about helping people. "We are saddened by the news that our great hero and leader Kabere is dead," he said. "He was a big farmer and a respected Njuri Ncheeke elder. I campaigned against Kabere, not because he did nothing, but because I wanted to take the mantle from [my father]. After I won he fully supported me." The county chief further said M'mbijiwe was the most learned person in Kenyatta's era and a senior Mau Mau leader.
