Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu yesterday outlawed buying of drinks by county government staff from outside the county. Ngilu said she wants to eliminate poverty and create wealth, by encouraging consumption of locally produced products. She wants to encourage the spirit of buy Kitui build Kitui. The governor said officers in her administration who used public money to buy and consume drinks from outside the county at the expense of locally produced juices would be surcharged. The governor even said It was time for the Kitui people to have the locally brewed Mawa alcoholic drink, which locals should relish in instead of drinking beer imported from elsewhere.  “I am praying that God would give us understanding and wisdom of using what he has already given us. It is time we embarked on producing and consuming our own,” said governot Ngilu.  She was speaking to agricultural officers and administrators from subcounties and wards at Kitui Agricultural Training Centre.  The officers were being inducted on how to manage greengram farming, which her administration has introduced as Kitui’s foremost cash crop.
