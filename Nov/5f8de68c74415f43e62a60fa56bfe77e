Private schools have asked the state to increase the number of national secondary schools to accommodate the more than 9,846 KCPE who scored over 400 marks. Elgeyo Marakwet Kenya Private Schools Association chairman Christopher Cheboiboch yesterday said national schools should be doubled so the candidates get slots in the coveted schools. “The government should now open more doors for our children because the number of candidates passing well in exams has been increasing,” he said. Cheboiboch said many candidates may miss an opportunity to join national schools due to equality in form one selection for private and public schools. The director of Salaba Academy in Iten praised Education CS Fred Matiang’i for ending exam cheating. The exam results were released on Tuesday. The first candidate had 455 marks.
