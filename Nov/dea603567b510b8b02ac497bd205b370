President Uhuru Kenyatta and opposition leader Raila Odinga should hold talks, despite yesterday’s Supreme Court verdict, bishops from Rift Valley and Western have said “Only dialogue between the two leaders and their camps will save Kenyans from a bad situation,” Bishop Henry Mukwanja of the Friends Church of Kenya said. He urged Kenyans to resist any attempts to divide the country along tribal lines. Mukwanja was speaking on Sunday during the opening of the newly established Soy yearly meeting of Friends Church in Likuyani subcounty on the border of Kakamega and Uasin Gishu counties. Rev David Songok, Bishop James Machai and Bishop Sybery Nyabero said Kenyans are anxiously waiting for political leaders to come up with a way forward. “The country is held hostage by politicians and things are not moving. People have lost their lives, the economy is going down and political violence is on the increase. We have to sort out the situation and stabilise the country,” Mukwanja said. He urged NASA and Jubilee leaders to ensure peace and justice prevail through dialogue to end the political tension.
