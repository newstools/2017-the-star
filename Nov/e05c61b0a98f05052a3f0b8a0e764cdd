If you go into politics, you should not be a trade union leader at all. ODM nominated MP Wilson Sossion is also the secretary general of the Kenya National Union of Teachers. Being an MP is a demanding and time-consuming job. Being the Knut CEO, the union of the most numerous segment of the national workforce, is also a full-time job. In all honesty, it is difficult to do two such high-profile and demanding jobs and deliver successfully. Sossion’s opponents who want to change the Knut constitution are doing the right thing to prevent the secretary general from leaving for Parliament. Sossion’s clinging to the Knut leadership is reminiscent of a number of prominent Kenyans in the 1960s to the mid-1980s who were wealthy in their own right, held high public office and sat on more than 10 private sector boards of directors. In Parliament he will still be able to contribute to the teachers’ causes and to genuinely add value.
