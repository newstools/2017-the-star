Police are investigating the mutilation of a 14-year-old girl reportedly forced to undergo FGM by her mother in Nga’ri village, Samburu Central. The victim sat the KCPE exam this year. She said the mother forced her to suffer the criminal practice.  “They woke me up at 3am and forced me through the painful act. I’m in lots of pain now,” the shaken girl said at the Maralal police station. Police are investigating. Samburu county police commander Alfred Agengo yesterday urged the communities still practicing FGM in the region to abandon it.  “This tradition is unlawful. It is a social and health problem because it affects a child emotionally and this might interfere with her education,” he said. The girl is to be taken to a rescue centre. Samburu Girls Foundation staff Paskalina Naibash said FGM is on the rise. She blamed it for the decline in girls’ enrollment in schools.
