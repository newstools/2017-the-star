Kandara MP Alice Wahome has urged NASA MPs to take Parliament business seriously and help end the political stalemate. The MP said it is possible to reach a solution with all Jubilee Party and National Super Alliance lawmakers involved. She said it is wrong to keep the country in the political season as the economy is suffering. The first election took place on August 8, the repeat on October 26 and Opposition politicians, including Raila Odinga, want a fresh vote in 90 days. "We need to put our heads together and decide whether there is a serious dichotomy that makes our country ungovernable and what to do about it," she said in Murang'a town on Wednesday. Wahome said legislators should also discuss whether extra positions can be created to accommodate poll losers. "I believe there is room for [this]. Anyone can win today and lose tomorrow." But Wahome castigated NASA People's Assembly move that will see protests take place on Friday. She noted MPs who join the movement, instead of representing their constituents, will be abandoning their roles. The MP noted many Kenyans are feeling the pinch of the dwindling economy and want to go back to building the nation. "Even those going to the streets still expect service delivery from the government," she said.
