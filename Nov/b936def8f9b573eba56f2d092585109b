Increased land disputes in parts of Mai Mahiu in Naivasha are delaying the extension of the SGR from Nairobi to Olkaria. Groups and families have emerged to lay claim to land on the route, holding up the project. This emerged when Naivasha subcounty commissioner Isaac Masinde led government officers toinspect theproject. Addressing the press after the tour, Masinde saidwork on the project was continuing, apart from few issues that were being resolved. He said a group of farmers and herders wanted to be compensated, though they did not have any legal documents to prove land ownership. “There is a group claiming part of the land but unfortunately they do not have any documents to prove this,” Masinde said. He warned a cartel believed to be inciting land owners on the issue of compensation, saying they would not be tolerated. “Apart from the ongoing rains that have affected progress, there is a group of persons misleading the public on the issue of compensation and we are keenly monitoring them,” he said. He termed the project y crucial to the economy of the country, urging all stakeholders to support it. “The government has invested heavily in this project as a plan to ease transportation of goods and persons from Mombasa to Naivasha,” he said. Earlier, Rift valley Regional Commissioner Wanyama Musiambo had warned that anyone interfering with the construction of the rail would be charged with economic sabotage. “We learned that some people are trying to sabotage the ongoing SGR project and we have intensified security along the route,” he said. The same message has also been relayed to residents of Narok and Kajiado counties where the modern railway line is to pass. The project is expected to connect Mombasa to Malaba Kampala.
