Families and friends of the Lake Nakuru chopper crash victims have urged the government to release a team of experts to investigate the accident. On October 21, a helicopter crashed into the lake with five people on board.  Witnesses said the helicopter flew above the lake (pictured) at normal speed, but plunged into the water within a few minutes of takeoff. The victims were identified as Anthony Kipyegon, Sammy Gitau, John Mapozi, Apollo Malowa (pilot) and Veronicah Muthoni. Three bodies have yet to be found. Kipyegon and the captain were buried on Saturday at their ancestral homes. Some families have been camping on the lakeshores, awaiting the bodies of their loved ones to be retrieved. They want the government to beef up the search team to fast-track the operation. Clothes and personal documents belonging to Mapozi were found at the northern side of the lake on Saturday, as more than 40 divers continued the search. The divers found a pair of trousers, a jacket, shoes and a wallet with money, NHIF and a national ID card.  Jonathan Kertich in charge of the disaster desk at the lake said they have decided to move into the forest. “We are leaving no stone unturned. We are not leaving anything to chance. We are doing anything and everything to retrieve and recover the three remaining bodies and the wreckage of the helicopter,” he said.  Diver Musa Silah said, “We want to search the forest tomorrow and it’s environs. Saturday’s recovery has taught us a lot.”
