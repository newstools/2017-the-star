The High Court in Kisii ordered a scrutiny and recount of votes at a polling station in Bomachoge Borabu constituency. Justice Hellen Omondi issued the orders on WednesdayÂ following an application by Thomas Matwetwe who is challenging Zadock Ogutu's win. She directed parties to witness the sealing of the ballot box from Nyakorere Primary School polling centre before taking it to court for safe custody. Matwetwe filed the application after 91 ballot papers marked in favour of Ogutu were found a few metres from the centre after the August 8 general election. The judge dismissed Ogutu's application for the petition to be dismissed on the basis that it did not have the date when the results were declared as required in election laws. She said the application could have been filed before the commencement of proceedings. But she disallowed Matwewe's request to access and scrutinise KIEMS kits used in seven polling stations. Matwetwe also wanted votes from Mosensema, Kenyenya, Ichuni, Rianyagita, Magena and Itonngo polling stations checked. Ogutu, an independent candidate, defeated the late Joel Onyancha, clinching the seat with 14,112 votes.
