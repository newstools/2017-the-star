Tea farmers in Bomet have been urged to spend their bonus wisely. At least 600,000 small-scale farmers affiliated to Kenya Tea Development Authority countrywide are set to receive Sh42 billion this year – Sh2 billion lower compared to last year’s bonus.  Banks in Bonet started paying last week on Monday. Bomet county commissioner Erastus Ekidor told the Star in Bomet yesterday the pay comes after months of hard work, and farmers should prioritise family needs instead of misusing the cash. “This is hard-earned money. It shouldn’t be wasted on drinking. Use it to uplift your families’ standards,” Ekidor said.      He urged farmers to beware of conmen as they receive their money.
