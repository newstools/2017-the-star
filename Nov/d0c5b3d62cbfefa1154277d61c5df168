Trans Nzoia county is ready to manage the highly infectious diseases classified under haemorrhagic fever that include Ebola, Marburg, Brucellosis and others. This is through a programme referred to as the Disease Infection, Prevention and Control. Kitale County Referral Hospital in the county has been selected as a pilot hospital to see how such diseases can be managed. Speaking to the Star on Friday, Kitale County Hospital superintended Emmnuel Wanjala said the programme is a partnership between the Ministry of Health, Centre for Disease Control Atlanta, CDC Kenya and the Kenya Medical Research Institute. Last week, the county was hit with a suspected Marburg fever. A visiting patient sought medication from a herbalist in Bwayi areas of Kwanza subcounty and later succumbed to the disease in Uganda.
