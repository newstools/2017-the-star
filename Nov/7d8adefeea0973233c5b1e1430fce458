NASA on Friday notified the police of their planned memorial on Tuesday to mourn and condole with the families of people who died in violent clashes with police last week. At least 25 people lost their lives on Friday, November 17, after supporters who had gone to welcome NASA leader Raila Odinga at the JKIA clashed with police. An autopsy report by government pathologist Johansen Oduor released on Thursday said 10 of the victims died of bullet wounds.

It was copied to Nairobi police commander Japheth Koome.  However, Koome told journalists in his office in Nairobi Friday morning that NASA had not notified them of the event. He said priority would be given to securing the city during the inauguration ceremony of President Uhuru Kenyatta at the Kasarani stadium. “The law is very clear. If anybody intends to hold a public gathering, he must inform the local OCS but up to this moment nobody has notified any of my station commanders of any other meeting on Tuesday,” Koome said.  He said the police will deal firmly with anyone convening an illegal gathering. NASA principal Musalia Mudavadi told journalists after a strategy meeting in Machakos on Friday that they will follow the law in their quest for electoral justice.  He reiterated that they do not recognize the Uhuru presidency.  Read: Raila is president, Mudavadi says, asks MPs to boycott Uhuru cabinet vetting Click here for the latest political stories
