Political analyst Barrack Muluka has officially been appointed ANC's secretary general. A gazette notice dated October 30 says Muluka took over from Godfrey Osotsi who was appointed to the National Assembly. Muluka was nominated to the post on October 14 after a meeting of of the national executive committee of Musalia Mudavadi's party. Amani National Congress is one of four parties under the National Super Alliance. The others are Raila Odinga's ODM, Kalonzo Musyoka's Wiper and Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang'ula's Ford Kenya. Mudavadi congratulated Muluka on the appointment saying: "I am confident he will contribute to the growth of the party to a boon." He added that the SG will be valuable not only to ANC but also to NASA and the country, especially while Kenya is going through unprecedented political turmoil. Muluka, who is also a publisher, once worked as Opposition leader Raila Odinga's campaigns director of communication. Some of the books he has authored include 'When Ogres Lived', 'Kandu and the Lake' and 'Why Dog Left the Forest'. On October 30, Khwisero MP Christopher Aseka criticised the blocking of the Muluka's appointment as Amani secretary general. Registrar of Political Parties Lucy Ndung'u declined the appointment on October 16 stating she had received a complaint from Evans Nyaribo, who said he was a founding member of the party. Nyaribo said the party did not follow procedure in Muluka's appointment. Aseka said ANC's national executive committee and parliamentary group meeting agreed Muluka would serve until further notice. He added the party is still strong and that when political temperatures lower, they will address the internal structure and formulate a plan for national growth.
