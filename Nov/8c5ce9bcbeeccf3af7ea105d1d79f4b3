EACC detectives on Monday arrested a Kitui MCA over a forged degree certificate. Nelson Musyoka was taken to court where he was charged with seven counts of forgery. The Ethics and Anti- Corruption Commission says the MCA had a forged certificate from University of Nairobi. The agency says the legislator used the document for employment as a Chief Officer in the Kitui county government. After this employment, it is said he got an avenue to campaign after which he was elected ward representative. The Voo ward representative appeared before Kitui principal magistrate Johnson Munguti. His lawyer Alphonce Kilonzi pleaded with the court to grant the MCA bail, noting it would be unfair to hold him since he is a member of a county assembly. "He will comply with the court orders," the lawyer added. Musyoka was released on Sh70,000 cash bail or Sh300,000 bond with a surety of a similar amount. The case will be mentioned on November 20.
