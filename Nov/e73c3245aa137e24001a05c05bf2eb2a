Protesters on Monday attempted to torch a section of Kondele police station's fence following riots over the Supreme Court ruling on Monday. The demonstrators lit the fire next to the cells before officers at the station put off the flames. The youths engaged police in running battles after the Supreme Court dismissed two key petitions which challenged President Uhuru Kenyatta's election on October 26. Shops at Kondele, Kibuye open-air market, Kisumu bus park, the central business district, and Kachok remain closed following the melee. Anti-riot police dispersed rioters who attempted to break into shops in the lakeside town. The rioters expressed their displeasure with the apex court's decision upholding Uhuru's election. Their position was that since no election took place in the region last month, the polls should have been nullified. The region largely supports NASA leader Raila Odinga who withdrew from the race citing lack of preparedness and reforms by the IEBC. "Even though our candidate pulled out of the race, we are still disappointed by the ruling because there were no elections," resident Maxwell Omondi said. "The process was a sham not only within the region but also in other areas across the country."
