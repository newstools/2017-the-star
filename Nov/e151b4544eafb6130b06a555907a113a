Vihiga county spent Sh408 million on unknown projects during the 2015/2016 financial year, Auditor General Edward Ouko (pictured) says in a new report. A total of 136 projects were included in the county budget. Ouko found that six others were abandoned despite Sh12.8 million having been spent on them. The audit also established that the county has a debt of Sh1.2 billion due to non-payment of contractors and supplies.  Most projects found to have been irregularly awarded have stalled. Ouko said Sh776.7 million had been set aside to fund the 136 projects. Only 52 projects valued at Sh310.5 million were completed. Four others, valued at Sh44 million, were ongoing. “The county did not deliver most expected projects,”  Ouko said in the report published on August 30.
