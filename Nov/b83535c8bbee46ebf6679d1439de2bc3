Former PCEA general assembly moderator David Gathanju and four others, who are charged with the theft of Sh39.9 million, have been urged to agree to talks with the church. Gathanju is charged alongside Esther Wanjiru, Peter Mwangi, Stephen Muhoro and James Muiruri. They have denied the charge and are out on Sh1 million bail each. Lawyer Muchiri Kimamo and Henry Leparmarai on Friday said the church does not wish to punish anyone and would embrace a structured out-of-court discussion.  The five are accused of stealing from the church between January 2, 2016, and June 30, 2017, at the PCEA headquarters in South C.  Lawyers Robert Mutito and Cyrus Gitari for the accused said they are not opposed to talks, but demanded witness statements.  The prosecution said it will not stand in the way of the talks. Senior resident magistrate Patricia Kabucho directed the lawyers to arrange the talks. The hearing was set for January 18, 2018, and the mention for November 22. She ordered the accused issued with witness statements.
