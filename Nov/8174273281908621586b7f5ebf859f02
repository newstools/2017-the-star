A Nairobi court has ordered two businessmen facing fraud charges in the Anglo-Leasing scandal to appear in person on November 16.  Deepak and Chamanlal Kamani were accused of conspiring to defraud the government of 40 million Euros (Sh3.8 billion). Senior principal magistrate Lawrence Mugambi, of the Milimani Anti-Corruption Court, gave the order after the two skipped hearings. They were ordered to appear before trial magistrate Felix Kombo, who was not present, for further direction. The prosecution, led by assistant deputy DPP Jacob Nderietu, informed the court on Monday that witnesses were ready to testify in the case.  The two businessmen were charged alongside their father Rasmi Chamanlal who has been exempted from attending the proceedings since he is unwell. Former Internal Security PS Dave Mwangi, former Finance minister the late David Mwiraria, Joseph Magari and David Onyonka were also charged in the case. Mwiraria had also been charged with engaging in a project without prior planning. The former government officials were also charged with abuse of office and willful failure to comply with procurement laws. Sound Day and Apex Finance corporations, which signed the contract to supply security equipment to the police department, were allegedly the direct beneficiaries of the money.
