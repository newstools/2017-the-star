  Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala on Monday led supporters in migrating from the Safaricom to Airtel in honour of NASA’s call for backers to boycott the telecommunication company. Malala arrived at an Airtel shop in Kakamega and bought a new line. He urged supporters to heed the boycott call. “It is not only Safaricom that we are boycotting. NASA mentioned three companies and we are boycotting all of them. The opposition named Safaricom alongside Brookeside Dairies and Bidco among those it wants supporters to boycott their products. They accuse the companies of supporting Jubilee. Malala said residents were also boycotting the products as a way of revenge. “Boycott of products has been there for a long time. They boycotted our Mumias and Nzoia Sugar which are now on their knees,” Malala said. The senator accused Jubilee of dividing Kenyans. He said the government has committed injustices that could force some Kenyans to secede. "Our people can decide to break away from the rest of Kenya and form their own country. It is Jubilee's fault," Malala said. He said he will rally his supporters to boycott paying taxes to the national government. "We will hold a people’s assembly on Friday at the Masinde Muliro Gardens to collect views from wananchi about the current political situation. We will then chart the way forward," Malala said. He said NASA supporters will not accept Uhuru's win even if the Supreme Court rules in his favour. Uhuru's reelection victory on October 26 has been challenged in court. NASA boycotted the election.
