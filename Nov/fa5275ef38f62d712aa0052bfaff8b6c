 South African based ICT firm Syspro has opened an office in Nairobi as it guns for a piece of the local manufacturing sector. The firm will provide software to meet manufacturers' and distributors' customised needs. Syspro managing director Mark Wilson asked manufacturers to adapt ICT solutions in bid to deal with increasingly complex business demands and changing economics of production for processes including assembling and batching. Some of the manufacturing solutions that the company is offering are in assembling, batching, configuration and engineering of products. According to the Kenya Association of manufacturers the move by Syspro to set a base in the country is an indication that local manufacturers are willing to face digital transformation and leverage on them to open up more opportunities. “Automation within the manufacturing industry - particularly its value chain will lead to efficiency, lower cost of production and result in increased competitiveness of products at the local, regional and international markets,” the association's chief executive Phyllis Wakiaga noted. Syspros General Manager for East Africa Patrick wafula noted that they aim to drive increased adoption of ICT in both manufacturing and distribution sectors.
