Rift Valley governors ferried at least 15,000 supporters in 100 hired buses to Kasarani Stadium, Nairobi, for President Uhuru Kenyatta's swearing-in yesterday. The vehicles left the North Rift in convoys on Monday evening. Governors Jackson Mandago of Uasin Gishu and Nandi's Stephen Sang flagged off the convoys in Eldoret and Kapsabet. “This region is a Jubilee stronghold. We celebrate the start of President Kenyatta’s second term in office because we know the Jubilee administration has done a lot for this country and more is on the way,” Mandago said. Hundreds of others paid their own way to Nairobi. Organisers said those travelling would be taken to Kasarani and back to their respective counties. They were also to be paid a modest allowance for upkeep, though the amount was not disclosed. Delegations were ferried from Baringo, Elgeyo Marakwet, Nandi, Samburu, Trans Nzoia, Turkana and Uasin Gishu. “We are telling our people to go celebrate at Kasarani and once back it will be time for us to unite and resume nation-building, which has stalled for almost a year now,” Sang said. Sang and Mandago urged the opposition to support Uhuru and compete with Deputy President William Ruto in 2002.
