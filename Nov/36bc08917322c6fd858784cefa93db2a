Mining CS Dan Kazungu has dismissed calls for Coast secession, terming it a bad move by the two governors of Mombasa and Kilifi. He accused Mombasa’s Hassan Joho and his Kilifi counterpart Amason Kingi of engineering the move to remain relevant in politics after their term ends. Joho, Kingi and a host of Coast opposition MPs are working to disengage the region from Kenya. They cite political and economic marginalisation. Tourism CS Najib Balala yesterday said self-rule is meant to distract public attention from “tragic negligence and incompetence of these county governments”. “Secession is a myopic, exclusionary, intolerant and populist means of realising parochial agenda that adds no development value,” Balala said. Kazungu questioned why the leaders did not consult all counties before going public. Addressing journalists at Ocean Beach Resort in Malindi on Saturday, the CS said the plan will cause division and conflicts. “This will be followed by the Mijikenda fighting the Afro-Arabs and thereafter, the Mijikenda subtribes fighting among themselves. Later on, clans will start fighting for power,” Kazungu said. He warned Kilifi Senator Stewart Madzayo and Kilifi North MP Owen Baya, who are also behind the move, that the road to secession is “slippery and destructive”. Baya said the Coast has faced many injustices since independence, which can only be resolved if it is independent. “Secession is not just about politics, it’s about empowering the people economically,” he said.  The calls for secession, Kazungu said, were initiated by Kingi a month ago with all the seven MPs, only for Joho to take the lead later. “Secession is a serious and weighty matter. Ideally, they should have taken time to consult widely with elders, Coast church and Islamic leaders, women and youths,” the CS said.
