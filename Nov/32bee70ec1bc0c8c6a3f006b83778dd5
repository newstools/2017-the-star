Women traders in Kabarnet town market yesterday accused Baringo Governor Stanley Kiptis of locking them out during the swearing-in of President Uhuru Kenyatta on Tuesday. They said Kiptis had promised to ferry them in two buses to Kasarani, Nairobi, for the ceremony. “We women in Kabarnet market were the first people to march around the town to celebrate the Uhuru and DP William Ruto's win,” Janet Chepyegon said. “Kiptis owes us apology, in fact we are eagerly waiting for him when he comes back he should be prepared with something to come and explain to us.” Click here for the latest political news
