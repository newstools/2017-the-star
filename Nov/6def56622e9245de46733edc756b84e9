Citizen TV news anchor Lillian Muli has clapped back at a man - only identified by the social media user name IamSeanJean - posted a comment on her social media criticising her interviewing skills. "I refuse to let people like these insult and get away with it! Why are people so angry though how do you draw a child into such stupid talk! To you Mr Blue suit Watch the interview on Youtube preferably when sober since you are clearly kinda inebriated (google that word lest you think it's the name of a country). I asked her mother about phones and then asked her if she's had any issues raising a teenager such as boyfriend drama. Did I at any point direct a boyfriend question to her!"  The screen siren was not done with IamSeanJean yet. Lillian went ahead to screenshot his account and give him another talking down to.
