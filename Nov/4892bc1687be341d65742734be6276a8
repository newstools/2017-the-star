Stones were hurled at top police officers in Kitui Central on Saturday morning as they restrained boda boda operators from lynching a miraa transporter. The driver knocked down their colleague Robert Masai and his passenger Anne Njeri injured, leaving them with injuries. Kitui Central deputy OCPD Kiprop Rutto and traffic base commander Charles Nyaga were ambushed in Mosquito estate in Kitui town. They were accused of protecting the driver whom residents insisted had been reckless. Driver Jacob Mutunga sped off immediately after the accident at about 10am at the AIC church Junction on Kitui-Mutomo road.  The boda boda riders were in hot pursuit so police officers fired several times in the air to scare them. "When the fleeing driver realised the riders were getting close, he abandoned his car and hid in a house in the estate," said an officer who did not want to be named. "The crowd then surrounded the house and threatened to burn it down if he didn't surrender." Police eventually pulled the man out of the house and took him to Kitui police station. Masai and Njeri were taken to Kitui Level Four Hospital with knee and facial injuries respectively. Click here for the latest political news
