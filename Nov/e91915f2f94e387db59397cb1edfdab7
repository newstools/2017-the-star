Police in Likoni are colluding with drug traffickers in the illegal business, MP Mishi Mboko has said. Mboko said criminal
gangs in are a result of drugs, which are sold to teenagers in the
open and under the watch of the police officers. Gangs such as the Watalia, Young Turks and Wajukuu wa Bibi have been terrorising residents in
Likoni, sometimes even during the day. Mboko said police know all the drug selling points but have refused to arrest culprits. “There are places within
Likoni which are known for drug trafficking. The dealers are known even by
kids, but you will never see them get arrested,” Mboko said. She was speaking yesterday at Travellers Hotel
in Mombasa. She accused police of arresting innocent youth instead of the real culprits whenever raids are conducted.
