Residents of Ichuga village, Kieni East subcounty, Nyeri county, yesterday held a protest and demanded justice for a man killed by Nyumba Kumi goons last week. It is alleged the goons were led by area chief Lucy Njeri and her assistant in search of illicit brew. Resident James Maina said their patience is running out as no action has been taken against Wachira Kabue's killers. Waving placards and twigs, they blocked the Nanyuki-Nyeri road for hours and threatened to take action. “The deceased has left behind a young family that depended on him, yet the culprits are carrying out their ordinary chores as if nothing happened. We will go out of the way and take action against them,” Rose Wangui said. Kabue, 46, was ambushed at his home last Tuesday night. When the search for illicit brew yielded nothing, the group turned on Kabue and a friend and beat them up. Duncan Gitonga, 50, who was with Kabue, said they were beaten with metal bars, crowbars and stones. “Wachira even dared them to kill him instead of leaving him to live with disability. They called an Administration Police vehicle from Baraka AP post in Laikipia East subcounty, which took us to hospital,” he said. Kabue died at Nanyuki Teaching and Referral Hospital on Wednesday morning. Area deputy county commissioner James Chacha yesterday did not answer calls and text messages. A number of Nyumba Kumi officials have fled from their homes for fear of attack. Kabue and his wdow Martha Mumbi had three children, two girls aged seven and eight, and a boy aged three. A week before Kabue's murder Nyumba Kumi members in South Imenti village, Laikipia county, allegedly beat boy, 14, to death for reportedly stealing a transistor radio and Sh700.
