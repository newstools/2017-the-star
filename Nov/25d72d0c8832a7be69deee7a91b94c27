A Mombasa court has declined to quash
an application by Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya to dismiss a
petition against him. Judge Mugure Thande said the
application will be heard although it was filed late.
 In her ruling, Thande said the issues
raised by governor Mvurya could not be wished away as it an issue of
law. Mvurya, through lawyer
William Mogaka, asked the court to strike out the petition against him
filed by voter Mwamlole Mbwana, saying it does not meet the
threshold. Mvurya said the petitioner had failed
to state the date of declaration of the results of the August 8
polls. The governor also wanted the
petition thrown out on grounds his challenger had failed to
enjoin his deputy Fatuma Achani. But Justice Thande said such
application should have been made during the pretrial. She said such should have been filed
and argued within seven days after filing of the petition. Thande said the law does not allow any
interlocutory application before commencement of the hearing. She said such applications
will derail the hearing of the petition considering that petitions
are constitutionally time bound. The case will be mentioned on November
8.
