British oil firm Tullow has said oil transportation may be moved further to 2018, when all work is completed and necessary government approvals are granted. “Activity will now move to focus on collecting further dynamic data from the fields. As part of an early oil pilot scheme extended production, water injection testing and a waterflood pilot test utilising the Ngamia-11 well are planned for the first half of 2018,” Tallow Oil Plc CEO Paul Mcdade said. He said the current phase of exploration and appraisal drilling in the South Lokichar Basin has been concluded and the focus is now on the development of the discovered resources. “In East Africa, both our projects are making steady progress towards final investment decisions with our Kenyan business beginning the important shift from exploration and appraisal to development,” Mcdade said. The firm, which first struck oil in Turkana’s Lokichar basin in 2012, had by June already pumped out and stored 60,000 barrels of crude in readiness for transportation to Mombasa port. The government however suspended plans for small-scale oil exports, saying the project was only viable for export following the enactment of the Petroleum Bill 2015 into law. In the plan, Kenya expects to move between 2,000 and 4,000 barrels of oil daily by trucks to be stored at the defunct Kenya Petroleum Refinery’s storage tanks in Mombasa pending shipment. Tullow is now reviewing all the data from the South Lokichar Basin and, in the first quarter of 2018, intends to give its assessment of contingent resources and plans for developing the basin. The firm said further technical work will be undertaken to assess and identify potential options to increase flow rates from the Etom field.
