There was a light moment at the High Court in Siaya when Gem MP Elisha Odhiambo was cross-examined following a petition contesting his win. Odhiambo (pictured) on Thursday said his nickname ‘Akuba’ means an enormous person, unlike his rival Jakoyo Midiwo’s ‘Otada’ that means ‘violence’. Odhiambo left the courtroom in stitches when he said his nickname meant someone huge, despite his short stature. He said he defeated Midiwo fair and square in the August 8 election.  Odhiambo defended his election, saying his predecessor Midiwo’s private tabulation of the results also put him in the lead. He said according to the results declared by the Gem constituency returning officer Martin Omollo, he garnered 34,693 votes, while Midiwo got 29,374. He added that Midiwo’s private tabulation presented in court indicated he [Odhiambo] got 34,583 votes against his rival’s 29,703.
