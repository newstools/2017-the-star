Former P-unit member and rapper Frasha has come out to say the country must move on from ‘Maandamano’ “First of all, I would like to congratulate our President Uhuru Kenyatta for being re-elected. Though the elections were marred with issues, for me I think we need to move on as a country and concentrate on other things as we rectify the problems we have.” Talking exclusively to Word Is, the Weka Weka hitmaker says he stepped down from the race where he was running for Athi River MCA because of the dirty side of politics, which he didn’t want to associate himself with.  “My idea to get into politics was to help. Once I got there, I saw the good side and the bad side, and the bad side is really bad. I didn’t want to get myself into that dirt, but now I can be able to serve the same people without getting into dirty politics.” Frasha, born Francis Amisi, went on to condemn the pre- and post-election killings. “For now, we need to stand out and say this is wrong regardless of the tribe, police are killing young guys and we need to stand out as artistes and say it is wrong. But again in terms of politics, we need to move our country forward. Hatuwezikua tunashinda maandamano tao. Time has come for us to move on. We cannot be having elections every five years and our country stops.” He then weighed in on the Babu Owino and Jaguar fight. “When you are elected, you are there to serve, you become a voice of the people. We should give a good example of ourselves as young guys. For me, I’d have better leadership in Parliament to show that its our time.” Frasha is currently ruling the airwaves with the song Sakata featuring Uganda’s Spice Diana.
