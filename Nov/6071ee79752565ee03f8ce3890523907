Former Embu Senator Lenny Kivuti has withdrawn his allegations against the electoral commission that it deliberately destroyed governor ballot papers with water to ruin his victory.  Kivuti, who has filed a petition against Embu Governor Martin Wambora, also said he does not need verification of the data from the KIEMs kits, which he had sought the preservation of. In his affidavit, Kivuti had accused the IEBC of pouring water on some ballot papers in Runyenjes. He withdrew the claim after the IEBC explained that the ballot boxes were rained on accidentally. He told Justice William Musyoka he believed the explanation. Kivuti said he did not think the affected ballots would affect verification, scrutiny and tallying of all votes, which he has applied for in his petition. Kivuti is seeking tallying of all the governor ballots that were cast during the August 8 General Election. He claims his votes were reduced during tallying. He also said Wamboraâ€™s votes were deliberately added and he was fraudulently declared the winner.  Kivuti was giving evidence while being cross-examined by his lawyer, Prof Tom Ojienda, and lawyers for the IEBC.
