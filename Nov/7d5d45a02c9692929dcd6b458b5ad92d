 Emirates Airlines does not plan to increase its number of flights to Nairobi just yet, despite a lively market. Orhan Abbas, senior vice president in Africa, said Nairobi is among the three most-vibrant routes on the continent for the airline. The others are South Africa and Egypt. “The political environment in Kenya this year was raising concern for us. However, we expect the mood to settle down and business situation to improve,” he said in an interview.  Emirates Airlines makes two daily passenger trips to Jomo Kenyatta International Airport and one cargo trip to the Eldoret International Airport. The award winning airline flies to 26 destinations in Africa, 22 of which are passenger flights, while four are cargo flights only.  Kenya is among three destinations in Africa that receive double daily services from the carrier. Others are Mauritius, that receives twice daily Airbus A380 flights, and Mahe in the Seychelles. The carrier will also start flying twice daily to Lagos, Nigeria, from December. Egypt’s Cairo and Cape Town in South Africa each receive three daily flights, while Johannesburg handles four daily trips, including one with the A380 airbus.  All the Emirates destinations to Africa fly the Boeing 777 aircraft. Abbas said Africa’s skies need to open up to enable doing business and compete with the rest of the world.  He said the toughest challenge to opening new routes in Africa is the signing of bilateral agreements to give favourable exchange agreements with new governments. However, there is hope with more African skies getting liberated, they will open a way for the airline to advance on its routes. The flier undertakes 165 flights from its Dubai headqurters to various destinations in Africa weekly, with over 5.8 million passengers carried in the year 2016/2017.
