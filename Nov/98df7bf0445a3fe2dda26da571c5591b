Hundreds of residents of Kerugoya town yesterday took to the streets to protest the murder of a form three student which occurred two weeks ago. Charles Kithaka (16) was killed by unknown assailants who stormed their home armed with a jembe and bludgeoned him to death. Led by Bishop Francis Wanderi, residents condemned the killing and called on police to arrest the perpetrators. "Those who committed that barbaric act will be severely punished by God," Wanderi said. The protesters broke a calabash in the heart of Kerugoya town as a sign of their curse upon the killers. Kirinyanga Central OCPD Yawa Chome said Kithaka was watching a movie on television when the attackers raided their home. His parents were already sleeping upstairs. They ransacked the house before stealing a television set, microwave and a DVD player. No suspect has been arrested. "I was very shocked to see my son lying in a pool of blood. There was no point in killing an innocent boy," Charles father John Mwangi said. Charles was a student at Meru Boys High School.
