Kwale county commissioner Ngumo Karuku has opposed calls of secession by Coast politicians, saying the move will cause clashes. Speaking on Sunday, Karuku said self-rule is not a solution to marginalisation and injustices the people of the Coast people have complained about. Instead, it will lead to bloodshed. “It’s not a quaranteed that if Kenya is divided, we will stop being marginalised and stop live in poverty as Coast people,” he said. Karuku urged local politicians and residents to respect the Supreme Court decision which upheld President Uhuru Kenyatta’s win on the October 26 repeat presidential poll. He said instead of leaders focusing their energy on politics, they should serve residents. Karuku said it times for them to deliver.
