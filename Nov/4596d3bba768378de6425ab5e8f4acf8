Technical University of Mombasa has closed indefinitely following the prolonged lecturers' strike. This comes barely two weeks before the university holds its fifth graduation. Vice chancellor Professor Laila Ababukar on Friday said students should vacate the campus by 9am Saturday. "By copy of this memo, security officer should ensure that the hostels and university premises are vacated as directed," she said. The closure came after a Special Senate Board meeting held on Thursday. Abubakar failed to comment on the status of graduation due November 30, though students are still clearing. But dozens of graduands have complained their names are missing from graduation list. On Wednesday, TUM students' President Daniel Otieno demanded that the VC makes an official communication on the status of learning within 24 hours. "She should close the university until the strike is over," he said. Lecturers have been on strike since November 1 and are demanding Sh10 billion CBA. They have vowed the will not resume teaching until the government honors their demand. Otieno said Education CS Fred Matiang'i should "abstain from politics as a plague" and end the strike which has affected learning in universities countrywide. Last week's talks between lecturers' union, UASU, and the Inter Public University Council Consultative Forum stalled. The lecturers' CBA is in two phases, with the national one covering basic salaries and house allowances.  The internal agreement, which was to be registered by May, caters for medical cover and pensions among others.
