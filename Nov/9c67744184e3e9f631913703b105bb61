Confederation of East and Central Africa Senior Challenge initially planned for this month has been pushed back by a week. The event was scheduled for November 25 to December 10th but will now run from December 3-17. The regional governing body postponed the tournament following requests by member countries including the Football Kenya Federation. Cecafa secretary general, Nicholas Musonye, said the move is meant to to allow the member countries which had not completed their domestic leagues to wrap their activities. He said the host country had also asked for more time to secure venues and government support. “We understand the players who play at this level are based in their local leagues and we had to put that in consideration. We also had to give Kenya time to complete on their preparedness in hosting a successful event. “There are small touches to be done on some venues and the one week we have given them will be suffiecient to put things in order. We also want the government to chip in and offer their assistance,” he said. Musonye further disclosed the ongoing quest for a broadcasting partner and the budget for the entire tournament. “We are still looking for a broadcasting partner for this year’s edition and once we make successful negotiations with the ones we have engaged, we shall reveal to the public. We shall also disclose the monetary value of our budget later,” he said. He said guest countries Libya and Zimbabwe are intact and will be among the 12 participants for the show.
