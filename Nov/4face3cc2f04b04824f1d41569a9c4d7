President Uhuru Kenyatta’s victory is a big gain for the Luhya, Mumias East MP Benjamin Washiali has said. The lawmaker said it symbolises a new dawn for the community. Washiali spoke after IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati declared Uhuru the winner of the repeat presidential election on Monday. He took a swipe at NASA over its polarising campaigns. “We’ve got the best people to lead this nation. Kenyans have spoken through the ballot. Let’s get back to work and make our country better,” Washiali said. Uhuru campaigned in Western Kenya, an opposition stronghold, after the Supreme Court nullified his victory on September 1. During his tours, he promised to give the region more rewards for supporting him. “We are expecting Mumias Sugar Company to be revived,” Washiali said. The MP said anyone aggrieved by the results should seek legal readdress and stop threatening the nation through economic sabotage and violence. “The people of Western Kenya will not itake part in economic sabotage. We’ll not gain anything from the resistance driven by NASA,” Washiali said.  “Uhuru garnered 50+1 votes and he led in almost all the counties. He was legitimately elected. We are waiting for the Chief Justice to swear him in,” Washiali said. The MP thanked the voters of Kakamega county who come out to vote for the Jubilee Party leader and Deputy President William Ruto.  He said residents gave UhuRuto a vote of confidence to serve for a second term, amid threats by opposition supporters to disrupt the poll. After the President and the DP have taken oath of office they will embark of uniting a deeply divided after a bruising battle.  Four counties in Nyanza did not vote. In Mumias East, Uhuru garnered 7,999 votes, Raila 346, Ekuru Aukot 24, Abduba Dida 27, Cyrus Jirongo 27, Kavinga Kaluyu 14, Michael Wainaina 10 and Joseph Nyagah 29. The constituency has 45,380 registered voters.
