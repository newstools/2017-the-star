Taita Taveta Governor Granton Samboja has told his critics to hold their horses because he is going to serve the county “for two terms”. He said the time for politics is over and the focus has shifted to serving residents. Speaking in the Mlilo and Kangemi areas on Saturday during thanksgiving rallies, Samboja said he will solve residents’ problems. “I floored them [rivals] on August 8 and they are now everywhere abusing and tarnishing my name. Tell them I am here for 10 years. I am energetic enough and capable of delivering on my election pledges,” he said.  Samboja added, “Water scarcity will no longer be a campaign tool during my administration. Already the Ndi-Mlilo water project is ongoing. The second phase connecting Mlilo and Kishushe will also be done. I have already sourced Sh53 million from well-wishers to make the project successful.” He said his government will work closely with sector players to ensure historical land injustices are solved. Samboja cautioned residents against selling their land at throwaway prices. “We have to protect our land. This habit of selling land without following the right procedures will not be allowed,” he said.
