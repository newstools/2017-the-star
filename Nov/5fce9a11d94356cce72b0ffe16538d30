Coast regional coordinator Nelson Marwa has said his success as an administrator nationally stands to be tainted by the high cases of insecurity in his Kuria community backyard in Migori county. Marwa said it is sad his home in Ntimaru town, Kuria East, and the larger Kuria area still grapples with high levels of insecurity. The administrator said it was unfortunate illegal guns, cattle rustling and a general state of insecurity are still rampant. “I cannot do so well out there when my home is burning and those who are burning are our local community,” Marwa said. He said it is unfortunate locals still blame subcounty commissioners and police officers. Marwa said the officers are only visitors and civil servants. “We want locals, elders and chiefs to help administrators end insecurity,” Marwa said.
