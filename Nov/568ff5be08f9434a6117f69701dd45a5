Residents of West Pokot have been cautioned against falling for fake land officers and surveyors. County Lands executive Joel Arumonyang yesterday said   unscrupulous land brokers take advantage of residents and lure them into shady deals. He urged residents to engage licensed surveyors when selling or buying land. “We have fake land brokers who are issuing fake title deeds,” Arumonyang said at his Kapenguria office. Kanyerus and Kopulio in North Pokot subcounty are the worst-hit, he added. “Many residents had migrated from the area some five years ago because of insecurity. Calm has now returned and residents have gone back, but we have heard that brokers are defrauding them of their land,” he said. It’s wise to consult the Lands office when getting land adjudicated or sold, Arumonyang said. “Don’t  be duped by to conmen, who wait for any little opportunity to make a kill.” Following the right procedures helps avert exploitation by  rogue brokers, Arumonyang said. He expressed concern that widows and the elderly frequently are the victims.
