World 800m record David Rudisha has started his preparations ahead of the next season after suffering an injury just before the August’s World Championships in London. Rudisha, who is also a two-time Olympic champion, he still has something to offer his fans hence the reason for his preps. “It is very unfortunate that I suffered an injury two weeks before the IAAF World Championships in London, where I was targeting to win another title,” he said. Rudisha is still undecided whether to take part in the April’s Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast, Australia, the Africa Championships or Continental Cup. According to him, continental championships are very important in terms of build-up, especially towards the bigger events. “This is where I started and I wouldn’t mind featuring one more time. I am a two-time African champion in the continental show,” he noted. He expressed concern that some elite athletes tend to ignore continental shows yet such events have over the years proved to be the breeding ground for stars,” he added. Rudisha became the first man to win back-to-back Olympic 800m titles since Peter Snell of Newzealand in 1964. He won the world 800m titles in 2011 (Daegu) and 2015 (Beijing) as well as 2008 (Addis Ababa) and 2010 (Nairobi) Africa championships.
