Jubilee leaders have asked NASA leader Raila Odinga to accept the outcome of the October 26 presidential repeat poll. Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen and National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale castigated NASA supporters for the destruction of property during protests on Friday. "It is unfortunate what we witnesses yesterday where an old woman was stabbed and robbed of bananas and more property destroyed. It is sad that a leader who was once a Prime Minister is profiling a community to just churn a path to power," the Senator said on Saturday. They were speaking during the burial ceremony of the late Nyeri Governor Wahome Gakuru. Murkomen said Raila and other NASA leaders should "stop the shenanigans of pushing one community to one side" and focus on rebuilding the nation.

Otherwise this is just a waste of time and energy because Kenyans made their decision and elected President Uhuru Kenyatta, make peace with that," he said. Duale also castigated the Opposition leader for loss of five lives and destruction of property during NASA protests. "How many lives do you want to see lost and property lost for you to reach where you want? Kenyans voted for President Uhuru and you moved to court, we accepted the ruling and the President was also elected on October, you cannot therefore continue charging Kenyans when the dice has been cast," he said. The Garissa Town MP asked Uhuru to end lawlessness in the country emanating from politics. Tear gas, gunshots and running battles were the order of the day for NASA supporters as they welcomed their Raila back from the US.
