Kenya will need 70 years to vet the over 80,000 police officers if the current pace does not change, the International Commission of Jurists has said. This means Kenyans will continue to be served by police officers with questionable, the lawyers body said. ICJ vice chairman Kelvin Mogeni on Friday said this is a result of the disconnect between policy formulators and implementers, which brings about difficulties in implementing good laws. In the last five years, about 5,000 police officers have been vetted. There are still 77,000 police officers yet to be screened. The National Police Service Commission is responsible for the vetting of the police officers. “If they continue doing the way they are doing right now, they may take over 70 years to vet all police officers in the country,” Mogeni told the Star. He spoke after he officially closed the Annual Jurists Conference in Mombasa. The disconnect between policy formulators and implementers has also affected the justice and the electoral systems in the country, according to Mogeni. Independent commissions are deprived of the much needed funds to execute their mandates, Mogeni said. Kenya has one of the best Bill of Rights in Africa, but the implementing systems are not designed to help Kenyans enjoy the rights. “For example, we have very good law on anti-corruption, electoral management and police reforms. But you see, you cannot have good police reforms if the National Police Service Commission does not have enough funds to do the vetting,” said Mogeni.  “We have good laws on elections, but not the right people to manage the polls,” said Mogeni. His remarks came two days after the Kenya Human Rights Commission urged the Wafula Chebulati-led IEBC to quit office.
