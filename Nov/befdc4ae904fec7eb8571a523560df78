Kenya beat South Africa Select 19-12 to win the Safland Sevens on Saturday in Namibia.  It was sweet revenge for Shujaa who had lost to the same opponents 24-21 in the preliminary matches earlier in the day. Sammy Oliech’s converted try saw Shujaa go 7-0 up before Willy Ambaka landed to give the team a 12-0 lead at the interval. Sam Muregi’s converted try gave Kenya a 19-0 lead before the select side featuring top South Africa Seven players came roaring back in the second half courtesy of tries to Cornal Henricks and Siviwe Soyizwapi, one of which was converted as Kenya held out to to win the match. Kenya had got off to a winning start on Friday, beating Namibia in the opening match. Try scorers for Kenya were Herman Humwa and Sammy Oliech.  In their second match Kenya edged Zambia 31-0, where Sam Muregi scored a brace with Willy Ambaka, Brian Tanga and Eden Agero scoring once each.  Agero and Tanga converted one try each. Kenya then whitewashed Bulls from South Africa 49-0 in their third match. Sammy Oliech scored a hatrick of tries with Herman Humwa, Nelson Oyoo, Eric Ombasa, scoring one each in the rout with Agero adding six conversions and Tanga one.  Kenya crushed Namibia Academy 38-0 in the semis to book their spot in the final. Assistant coach Will Webster was delighted with the performance in the two-day tournament ahead of the start of the World Series in Dubai early next month. “Happy that we have won the tournament, beating a formidable South Africa side in the final.  The confidence and the combination in the teams is impressive and by the time we go to Dubai will be competitive and very strong,” added Webster.  He said there is room for for improvement ahead of the season opener. The team will continue with their training in the next two weeks before a 12-man squad is named for the opening two legs in Dubai and Cape Town later in the month.  The team will jet off on November 27 to Dubai.
