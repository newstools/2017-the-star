Emmerson Mnangagwa is to be sworn in as Zimbabwe's president, following the dramatic departure of Robert Mugabe after 37 years of authoritarian rule. The former vice-president - who returned from exile on Wednesday - will be inaugurated at Harare's stadium. His dismissal this month led the ruling Zanu-PF party and the army to intervene and force Mugabe to quit. The opposition is urging Mnangagwa, who has been part of the ruling elite, to end the "culture of corruption". The news on Tuesday that 93-year-old Mugabe was stepping down sparked wild celebrations across the country. It came in the form of a letter read out in parliament, abruptly halting impeachment proceedings against him. In it, Mugabe said he was resigning to allow a smooth and peaceful transfer of power, and that his decision was voluntary. Neither Mugabe nor his wife Grace have been seen in public since Sunday, and their whereabouts are unknown. On Thursday, several reports suggested Mugabe had been granted immunity from prosecution. State TV said he would attend the inauguration. The ceremony will be at the 60,000-capacity National Sports Stadium in the capital, with organisers calling on Zimbabweans to come and witness a "historic day". Ahead of the swearing-in, Mnangagwa urged Zimbabweans to "remain patient and peaceful and desist from any form of vengeful retribution". He fled to South Africa two weeks ago - only to return home on Wednesday's to a hero's welcome.
