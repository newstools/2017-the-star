Lack of funds has hampered the recovery mission at Lake Nakuru after last month's helicopter crash, Governor Lee Kinyanjui has said. Five people were on board during the October 21 crash. Two bodies have been retrieved and three and still missing. The occupants were Nakuru Senator Susan Kihika's bloggers Sam Gitau, John Mapozi and Antony Kipyegon. The others were pilot Apollo Malowa and Veronica Muthoni. The bodies of Malowa and Kipyegon were retrieved on October 23 and buried. Accompanied by the rescue team, Kinyanjui said the county has been spending money from its normal operations budget to fund the recovery efforts. “The Treasury has not yet released money to counties. Despite that, my government stepped up to allocate more resources to ensure the search and recovery efforts have been stepped up,” the governor said. Kinyanjui said the recovery progress been hampered by a number of issues. “No one knows the exact point the chopper went down," he said. Other challenges are presence of hippos, poor visibility in the lake due to pollution, strain on resources and lack of superior equipment, Kinyajui said. He said the national government, through the Interior ministry, is in the process of procuring superior marine search equipment. The equipment include side scan sonar, multibeam echo sound and marine magnetometer. He assured the families the search efforts will only end after all the bodies and the chopper wreckage are retrieved from the lake.
