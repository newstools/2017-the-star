Politicians’ utterances are a threat to peace, National Cohesion and Integration Commission member Roba Sharamo has said. He spoke yesterday in Mwingi during a peace meeting that brought together more than 80 community opinion leaders. Sharamo said newly elected leaders  are engaging in politics of ethnicity to gain cheap popularity at the expense of peace.  “It’s worrying that the elections have  divided Kenyans along two coalition affiliations. The political divide has hatched ethnic lines. The counties are not left behind too,” the commissioner said. So far, 30 cases are pending in court touching on defamation, hate speech and offensive conduct. Sharamo warned politicians against playing dirty games for mileage.  There are 300 cases connected to social media, which Sharamo said should be used appropriately. He urged social media users and politicians to be mindful of their language.   Despite boundary conflicts at the Tana River-Kitui border, the commissioner said the county’s scorecard is largely peaceful.
