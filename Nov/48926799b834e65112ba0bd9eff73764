Nairobi and Eldoret are set to benefit from a Sh 1.2 Billion funding from Belgium. Ambassador Nicholas Nihon says the money is aimed at enhancing fire fighting capacity in counties. It will be a soft loan to help build five fire stations and supply 30 fire fighting engines. “We recognize the need for institutions to have better capacity to deal with fire challenges through having modern machinery required for counties and schools among other areas,” Nihon said. He said Beligium would waive 35 per cent of the cost while the rest would be repaid over a period of time. He said the Belgium Somati Vehicles company would help to establish a major Disaster Management Unit in Uasin Gishu County. Chemno noted that there is a rise in fire incidents hence the need to upgrade.
