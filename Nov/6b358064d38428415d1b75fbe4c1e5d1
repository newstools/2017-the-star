  Operations at the Garissa County Referral Hospital have resumed after more than 100 striking nurses returned to work on Monday. A spot check by the Star showed patients trooping back to the hospitals. Casual labourers and other support staff were busy cleaning the wards The busy hospital, which serves the neighbouring Kitui, Wajir and Mandera counties, has 158 nurses. The nurses have been strike for five months.  A patient who spoke to the Star were delighted.  Abdi Omar, who suffers from asthma, is among the patients who received treatment. “I thank God the nurses’ strike is over. I have suffered a lot. I couldn’t get treatment because private hospitals are very expesive,” Omar said. However, a nurse who spoke to the Star on condition of anonymity, said they got a raw deal. “After fighting for all those months we deserved a much better offer,” she said.  Hassan Abdullahi, the nurse in charge at the Garissa Referral Hospital, said during the nurses’ strike, the hospital suspended all admissions and only handled emergency cases and deliveries in the maternity wing.
