An employee of the Nyandarua county assembly has been arrested in connection with the brutal murder of his wife. Lawyer Samuel Gicheha, who works in the clerk's office, was arrested last Friday afternoon, following pressure from residents who held demos demanding justice. The body of Mary Wangui's, 23, was found in a bush on the Ol Kalou-Gilgil road on Thursday evening. Residents accused Gicheha of cheating on Wangui with a policewoman. They said he called Wangui and her mother Agnes Njeri on Thursday to an undisclosed destination. But Njeri, a trader at Ol Kalou open air market, declined to go. Wangui left her one-and-a-half-year baby with her mother, took Njeri's phone and went to meet her husband. Moments later both her phone and her mother's were switched off. Nyandarua Central police boss Wilson Kosgei said the two phones were switched off at the same time.
