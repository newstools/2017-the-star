The Nairobi
Securities Exchange blinked green with 30 counters gaining just an
hour after yesterday's Supreme Court ruling that upheld the
re-election of President Uhuru Kenyatta. A spot check on the
bourse using Nutcracker, a real time stock tracker at 11.15am showed
30 counters gaining, 34 stagnating with only four losing. Before
that, there were less activities at the stock exchange with 47
counters in orange at 9.30am. The benchmark NSE-20
share index rose 1.67 percent to 3,788.88 points while NSE25 gained
50.25 points to settle at 4301.57 compared to the previous trading.
The Nairobi all share index on the other hand gained a marginal 0.55
per cent with 164.03 points compared to 163.13 on Friday last week Reuters reported NSE
to having climbed 1.4 per cent, th highest level since September 22.
Yields on Eurobond on the other hand dropped to a three weeks low of
6.03 per cent, indicating improvement of the country's risk profile
on the back of expected political stability Consequently, the
Kenya shilling which was trading at Sh103.78 against the dollar
before the verdict was delivered gained more than 10 cents within an
hour to trade Sh103.57 against the greenback. Speaking to the
Star, Aly-Khan Satchu, CEO of Rich Management termed the ruling as a win
for Kenya, hoping that it will put to end the long election cycle and
turmoil that has necessitated a wait and see attitude among investors ''We have seen an
immediate and positive response across all Kenyan assets. The Supreme
Court have wielded a Guillotine and the markets are breathing a sigh
of relief. The markets were not prepared for a further 90 day delay
and nor was the Economy,Investors will hope that today's decision will
prove a catalyst for faster growth,'' said Satchu The country's money
markets response to yesterday's presidential election verdict is in
sharp contrast to that one witnessed on September 1 ruling by the Supreme Court that ordered for a fresh presidential election, after annulling President Uhuru Kenyatta's win in the August 8 election. On that day, NSE plunged a
massive 9.71 per cent as investors
pondered another 90 days of
political uncertainty. The market was forced to halt trading for
almost three hours after the September due to a severe crash on most counters that saw at
least Sh50 billion wiped from counters.
