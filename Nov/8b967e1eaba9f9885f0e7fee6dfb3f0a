Two Jubilee MPs have asked the opposition to stop politicking until 2022 when another General Election will be held. North Mugirango MP Joash Nyamoko and his Nyaribari Chache counterpart Richard Tong’i said the Supreme Court’s decision to uphold President Uhuru Kenyatta’s rerun win ended the electioneering period. “We should now put politics behind us and embark on rebuilding this country. We cannot afford another period of political campaigns,” Nyamoko said. “Our economy is almost in shambles,” Nyamoko added. Nyamoko, who spoke to the Star on phone on Tuesday, urged Kenyan to accept the court ruling. “It was a very objective decision and a win for the rule of law,” Nyamoko said. Tong’i said Kenyans cannot afford to keep the country in a campaign mood forever. ”It is now time to work,” Tong’i said.
