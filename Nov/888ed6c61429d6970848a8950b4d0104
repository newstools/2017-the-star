You did not die in vain. You sacrificed your lives for the cause of democracy as it gave you the freedom to choose your leaders and determine the direction of your country,‚Äù he said.

The NASA leader maintained the country is currently in a political disarray as many Kenyans do not accept the legitimacy of the October 26 election. He said another election will offer a solution to the current situation as IEBC is riddled with criminal elements who cannot allow a free, fair and credible election. He said since they began their campaigns before the August 8 general election, President Uhuru Kenyatta and his brigade has been repeatedly accusing the NASA family of planning to cease power unlawfully. "They have been accusing us of planning crimes of which everyone now knows they have been committing. But we want all Kenyans to know we are not going to back down on the fight for democratic change and rule of law," Raila said.
