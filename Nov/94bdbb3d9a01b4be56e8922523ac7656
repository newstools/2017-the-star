Twitter has suspended its verified-profile scheme and described it as "broken", following complaints over the type of accounts being verified. Typically, prominent people including journalists, musicians and company executives, get a blue icon on their profile after proving their identity. "Verification was meant to authenticate identity and voice but it is interpreted as an endorsement or an indicator of importance," Twitter said on Thursday night. "We recognise that we have created this confusion and need to resolve it. We have paused all general verifications while we work and will report back soon." Twitter founder Jack Dorsey said the scheme would now be "reconsidered". "We should've communicated faster on this: our agents have been following our verification policy correctly, but we realized some time ago the system is broken and needs to be reconsidered," he said. Dorsey said the company failed by not doing "anything about it" but noted that they were working now to fix it faster. Twitter has been making a series of changes to its platform in the last weeks. On Thursday they said a user's Twitter display name can be up to 50 characters in length.  "Go ahead, add that middle name or even a few more emojis," the company said. Earlier this week, Twitter introduced the expanded 280-character tweets for all its users' worldwide. This was after a limited experiment, which began in September, to see if a larger character count reduced "cramming”'and led to users better expressing themselves. Prior to this, Twitter limited posts to 140 characters. More on this: Twitter changes character limit, doubles count to 280 characters "We're expanding the character limit! We want it to be easier and faster for everyone to express themselves. More characters. More expression. More of what's happening," Twitter product manager Aliza Rosen said.
