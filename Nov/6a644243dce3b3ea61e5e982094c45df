Miraa campaigner Rajesh Hirani has told NASA leader Raila Odinga to stop his civil disobedience plans, saying it will hurt the economy. NASA has already asked their supporters to boycott products and services from companies they accuse of supporting Jubilee. Speaking in Meru town yesterday, Rajesh said he was willing to plant 1,000 miraa trees for Raila if he stopped frustrating the government.  “Raila enjoys chewing our miraa and that is why he always visits Nyambene. I promise him at least one thousand trees so that he can enjoy them at his own comfort. It will also give him an alternative source of income when he retires,” Rajesh said.  He said said he is planning to plant 100,000 miraa trees during the current rainy season as part of his promotion of the crop.
