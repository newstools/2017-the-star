Circuit boards, plastics and metal components in electronic waste contain harmful chemicals, such as mercury and arsenic, and metals including lead. In light of this, SGA has partnered with Enviroserve to safely recycle e-waste and destroy parts that are not suitable for recycling. Old office equipment, computers, cables and TV sets are thoroughly sorted, recycled, or safely destroyed to help keep the environment in Kenya habitable. SGA guarding general manager Nelson Agono said, “Enviroserve collects our unwanted equipment and dismantles each item for sorting into material for local recycling, or shipping to the company’s facility in Dubai.” “We receive a certificate of destruction and recycling, which covers our sustainability, ISO, regulatory and brand protection requirements.” Another example of SGA’s concern for the environment is the care taken by the company’s vehicle workshop personnel with the disposal of used oil. This is filled in drums in a collection area with a containment wall and spill arrest kit.   About SGA SGA Security is the region’s leading Security Services firm, with fixed base operations in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania servicing security contracts throughout the continent.  SGA has 32 branches and more than 17,000 employees spread through East Africa.  The group provides manned guarding services, cash in transit (CIT) and cash management, electronic security, including alarms, access control and CCTV, event security and VIP services, cargo tracking and escort, consultancy and investigation, as well as specialised services in the cyber security field.
