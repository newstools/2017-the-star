Business is slowly returning to normal in Kisumu after heightened political tension over the presidential rerun on October 26.  The business community is optimistic of getting back on its feet after incurring heavy losses during the anti-election protests in the county. Kisumu Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry chairman Jared Ochanda said on Wednesday traders are confident of recovering. They believe their businesses will begin flourishing again. He blamed the huge losses on the chaos that followed the presidential poll. Tension is dying out. The environment is becoming more conducive for business after the IEBC announced the election results on Monday, Ochanda said. “I can say that things are picking up steadily. Many businesses have resumed operations, “he said. Kisumu Business Coalition chairman Israel Agina, urged investors to come to the county. Speaking to the press in Kisumu on Wednesday, he said the demos hugely affected the economic growth of the region. He said even though businesses made massive losses as a result of the demonstrations, Kisumu still needs more investments. The mining, agrochemical and transport sectors were affected by the chaos. Many traders were unable to access markets because the roads were blocked. “After the August 8 General Election, business in Kisumu suffered. Residents protested because they felt their votes didn’t count,” he said. Agina urged politicians to put Kenya first before any other interest. He said if the country remains peaceful, there will be development.  George Okungu, a hotelier, said lack of peace will cause investors to flee.
