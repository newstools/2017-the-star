Shinyalu MP Justus Kizito has said he will run for Kakamega governor in 2022. He spoke on Friday during the Sigalagala Polytechnic graduation ceremony. Kizito endorsed his Ford Kenya competitor in the last election and Knut branch chairman Patrick Chungani to take over from him. “As you know ladies and gentlemen in the year 2022 the office of the governor of Kakamega county will be vacant and I’m one of the candidates for that office. At that time, I will leave Shinyalu in the able hands of my former competitor here Patrick Chungani,” he said. Kizito urged President Uhuru Kenyatta and NASA leader Raila Odinga to start national dialogue, adding the country is divided right in the middle and it will be difficult for Uhuru to lead the country unless he unites everyone. “I’m saying this because we need peace in this nation. One cannot lead a divided nation because he will lean on one side and leave the other part out,” he said. Kizito added, “Quite a number of Kenyans do not recognise Uhuru as the President. They don’t. But in order to carry everybody along, Uhuru should look for Raila Odinga so that we can have a serious discussion and move the country forward.” He said Raila cannot be ignored.
