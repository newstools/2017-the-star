A Member of Parliament who has battled four different cases against his win since nominations in May has finally won a petition against his August 8 win. Endebess MP Robert Pukose is now a relieved man after a High Court in Kitale dismissed a petition against his win with costs. The MP’s closest competitor Robert Simiyu wanted the court to scrutinise the votes, saying election was not free and fair. Justice Cecillia Gatua dismissed the petition due to technicalities, citing late filing of the petition and failing to serve the respondents on time. Justice Gatua ordered the petitioner to pay a sum of Sh2.5 million to both the Independent and Electoral Boundaries Commission and Pukose. “The petitioner having filed the petition late and having not served the petition to the respondents, I hereby dismiss the case with costs” Gatua said.
