Governors will be judged harshly by history if they sit and watch as selfish politicians destroy Kenya, Nyandarua’s Francis Kimemia has said. He spoke on Tuesday at the county headquarters during the swearing-in of 10 executives and the county secretary. Kimemia said the 47 governors should lead their people in rejecting the county People’s Assemblies being advocated by NASA. NASA has sent the motion for the People’s Assembly to the 47 county assemblies to push for electoral justice and constitutional review.  “I appeal to them to unite as governors and build our nation,” he said. Kimemia said Kenya faces diverse challenges and is losing “almost a trillion shillings just because of one person”.
