The imports and exports market will from next year get a major boost once the standard gauge railway cargo trains start operating. Transport CS James Macharia on Wednesday said the cost of moving a container from the Port of Mombasa to Nairobi will not only be cheaper, but it will now be done within 24 hours. “To transport a 24-foot container on our roads is Sh85,000 but it will be Sh50,000 once freight services begin,” he said, when he launched the inter-county train services. Already, the CS said, the inland container terminal is taking shape with 98 per cent progress. Macharia said measures have already been put in place by Kenya Ports Authority and and Kenya Revenue Authority to make the container movements seamless. The tariffs for moving containers from Mombasa Port to Nairobi are currently undergoing stakeholder participation. While confirming that stakeholder participation on tariffs is on, the Kenya Shippers Council said it supports the ministry to have competitive rates. “There is a conducive environment and issues to do with value for money, last mile and returns are being discussed,” said Agayo Ogambi, the Kenya Shippers Council head of advocacy. The Mombasa Port’s total annual freight handling is expected to exceed 50 million tonnes by 2030, doubling from 24 million tonnes in 2015. The port handled 11.4 per cent more cargo in the first quarter of this year, largely due to increased efficiency. It handled 7.2 million tonnes of cargo between January and March against 6.5 million tonnes recorded in a similar period last year. Imports through the port accounted for 6 million tonnes against 5.5 million tonnes handled in the same period in 2016, an increase of 559,745 tonnes, or 10.3 per cent. Exports recorded 877,778 tonnes, higher than 845,068 tonnes handled in the same period last year, and representing an increase by 32,710 tonnes or 3.9 percent. Dry ports have been proposed in Voi and Naivasha and inland container depots in Embakasi, Eldoret and Kisumu. The CS said the inter-county train will improve connectivity within counties.
