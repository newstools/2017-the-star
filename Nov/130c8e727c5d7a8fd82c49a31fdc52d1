Mathira MP Rigathi Gachagua yesterday told off NASA for planning to swear in Raila Odinga as President. Gachagua said there is no shortcut to power other than through the ballot.  Speaking in Kangocho, he said Jubilee will not allow anybody to divide the country along tribal lines.  “The opposition should know we are a unitary state, with united people under one boundary and under one President Uhuru Kenyatta.  There is no way we shall accept leadership without it being done through the ballot,” he said.   He vowed to ensure Parliament will not allow any motion tabled by NASA aimed at dividing the country into tribal segments.  “We are the majority in the Senate and in the National Assembly and anyone from NASA who will attempt to table any motion that will divide Kenyans will be in for a rude shock,” he said.
