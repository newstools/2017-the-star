Fifteen ACK bishops on Tuesday called on political leaders to sit down and talk to  reconcile the country after a divisive election. The religious leaders, from the diocese of the greater Maseno region, said they were ready to bring President Uhuru Kenyatta and NASA leader Raila Odinga to the table. The diocese covers Eldoret, Kapsabet, Kericho, Nambale, Katakwa, Bungoma, Butere, Mumias, Bondo, Maseno West, Maseno East, Maseno South, South Nyanza and Kisii.  “We recognize peace can only be attained in an atmosphere where respect for the rule of law, human dignity and sanctity of life, truth and justice exist,” Bishop Simon Oketch said. Oketch, who is the Maseno North Diocese Bishop, read the statement on behalf of his colleagues. He asked political leaders both from the government and opposition to seek genuine reconciliation of all Kenyans. “We commit, together with other religious leaders to support reconciliation efforts,” Oketch said. They were attending a two-day leadership summit at Bishop Nicholas Stam Pastoral Centre in Kakamega. The training centered on the church as the voice of the nation in a divisive election. Oketch said that the church demonstrated its commitment to dialogue and reconciliation when it invited both Uhuru and Raila to attend its first centenary celebrations in Nairobi on Sunday.  It was the first public meeting of the two leaders since the disputed August 8 presidential election. Uhuru said he was open to dialogue to unite the nation. Raila said there cannot be dialogue and peace without justice.  “The two leaders had never met since the disputed presidential election but we managed to bring them together and they had a handshake,” Oketch said.
