Twitter has introduced the expanded 280-character tweets for all its users' worldwide. The move comes after a limited experiment which began in September to see if a larger character count reduced “cramming” and led to users better expressing themselves. Twitter limited tweets to 140 characters, but has doubled that to 280 characters.  More on this: Twitter changes character limit, doubles count to 280 characters "We're expanding the character limit! We want it to be easier and faster for everyone to express themselves. More characters. More expression. More of what's happening," Twitter product manager Aliza Rosen said on Wednesday. During the experiment, Rosen said people had more room to Tweet and received more engagement, more followers, and spent more time on Twitter.  "People in the experiment told us that a higher character limit made them feel more satisfied with how they expressed themselves on Twitter, their ability to find good content, and Twitter overall," Rosen said. "We saw when people needed to use more than 140 characters, they Tweeted more easily and more often. But importantly, people Tweeted below 140 most of the time and the brevity of Twitter remained." Easier to Tweet Rosen said with the expanded character count, the problem of fitting a thought into a Tweet was massively reduced. "Since we saw Tweets hit the character limit less often, we believe people spent less time editing their Tweets in the composer," Rosen said. "It shows that more space makes it easier for people to fit thoughts in a Tweet, so they could say what they want to say, and send Tweets faster than before."
