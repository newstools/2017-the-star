The King of Kenyan comedy is back with a new talent search show that seeks to give anyone with a knack to crack jokes a chance to further their career. The show, Ultimate Comic, has already selected 36 contestants who will go head-to-head for the coveted title. "Thirty-six comedians are going to step up on the stage. Maybe not all will end up doing professional comedy, but out of the 36, I'm sure five will make it in the industry, and that is a big addition to the industry," Churchill told Word Is. "What I can tell the upcoming comedians is that they are the future and it takes time. It has taken me 15 years to be here, and they don't have to take that long. They just need to understand the direction they want to take and focus on it. Follow your heart and your passion. If have it, you have it; it is what it is." Churchill has mentored most Kenyan comedians. He says his joy is seeing each one curve their own niche in the industry. "I feel like a headmaster to the comedians I have mentored. The dream of every teacher is to see all of you end up doing something good for your careers. There is no teacher who wishes for students to become subordinate members of staff, one who winds up slashing grass in a school you went to. No teacher will want that," Churchill said. "Comedy is a serious business. If you don't laugh, that means you have more problems than we can make you laugh. So just appreciate, support us, pay, don't ask for complimentary tickets. We need that money so that you don't say we are broke. Parents, if you have a talented kid, encourage them, you never know. It is a new market and I am sure the future is content, and once the content is put on a digital platform and on your phones, I think in two to three years, we shall be talking of a different story."
