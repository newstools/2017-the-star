Starring: Brandon Micheal Hall, Lea Michele, Bernard David Jones, Marcel Spears, Yvette Nicole Brown Genre: Comedy Created by:   Jeremy Bronson    When I saw the release of this show, I was exasperated at the attempt to create yet another trivial 20-minute comedy. But a recent Twitter thread reminded me just how relevant this topic is.  You see, recently, the line between politician and entertainer has been erased, as every hip hop artiste or reality star with a point of view wants to serve in government. As is evident in the US, where a former reality star resides in the White House, or by the likes of Jaguar in Kenya. This is also the story of The Mayor. Courtney Rose is a struggling hip hop artiste of meagre talent who wants to promote his music. He ends up vying for the mayor of his hometown of Fort Grey. Courtney’s opponent is councilman Ed Gunt.  Courtney uses the good memories he has of the town to win the people over. He also makes implausible promises to the community since he doesn’t believe he can win.  To his shock, he wins the election. Suddenly, he has to step up to the task of being the town’s mayor and somehow fulfilling all the promises he made to the people. The show’s message is simple: running for elections might be a popularity race, but the position is an actual job that requires hard work and dedication.  The Mayor manages to deliver this message whilst entertaining us. But in between laughs, the question is loud as ever: if someone is popular and entertaining, does that mean they are fit for office?     Star Rating: 3/5
