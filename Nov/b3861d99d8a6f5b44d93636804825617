Young women should not despair when things do not work out as planned, psychologist Gladys Chania has said. She said some lose focus when they do not get an education as a result of coming from poor backgrounds. Others, Chania said, lose hope when their small businesses crumble and they are left paying loans, while some exhaust their savings. She was speaking at TEDx Kenya Expo organised by Grace Kinuthia in Wangige town, Kikuyu constituency, Kiambu county, on Saturday. “We have seen talented, ambitious and hardworking women wasting their potential because they lack people to support and encourage them,” Chania said. “Some end up getting married to see if things will work out, only to leave their education and talent as history. It’s not bad to get married, in fact it is God-created and I encourage it.” She urged women to exploit and cultivate their potential and showcase it to their friends and families, while seeking ways of marketing their products and services. “We have artists, cooks, curators, beauticians and many other interesting abilities, which people have even gone to school to polish. Let us make our capability known and our duty remains supporting our people,” Chania said.  She urged jobless young women who have graduated from university, college and other institutions of higher learning not to lose hope. “We appreciate the fact a lot of people have been well educated and hold beautiful credentials, but they haven’t gotten placements. Do not lose hope. Instead, be creative and start doing jobs that will satisfy your needs as you keep checking out for placement,” Chania said. Kinuthia said TEDx countrywide encourages women by inviting others who have excelled in life after overcoming many challenges. “People learn to be patient, aggressive and innovative from other’s experiences. We target young women, whether married or not, to give them hope in life and encourage them that there is a brighter tomorrow,” she said.
