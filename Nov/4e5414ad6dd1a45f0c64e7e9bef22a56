Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i has promised the government’s commitment to reward the best performing headteachers in public primary schools. The CS said the government has decided to introduce a reward system as an incentive following the good performance from many public schools in the 2017 Kenya Certificate of Primary Education examination. “Those headteachers whose schools recorded the best performance will be supported by the government to improve infrastructure,” said Matiang’i when he released the KCPE exams. Among the benefits include sports facilities and classrooms while the best performing head teacher will be individually rewarded by the Ministry in collaboration with Teacher Service Commission (TSC) to reward them. “Overall, the top performer in this year’s KCPE is 455 marks up from 437 marks in 2016. The number of candidates scoring 400 marks and above rose to 9,846 in 2017 from 5,143 last year,” he added. This years' KCPE recorded zero cases of malpractices.
