Hamisa Mobetto, the video vixen with whom Diamond Platnumz cheated, is making headlines. Again!  This time, the model-cum-actress is said to have followed the bongo singer to Dubai and spent the best part of last week together.   Mobetto denied the claims, saying, "People should just get used to it kwa sababu ni baba wa mtoto wangu. Lakini no, sijakutana na Naseeb Dubai. Hata ningekutana naye its for me and him to know not for people. It's for me to know and for them to find out." She added, "Sipendi kuongelea kuhusu baba watoto zangu, unajua the Internet never forgets. I don't want them to grow up and read the nasty stories." When asked about the child support case she had filed against her celebrity baby daddy, Hamisa simply responded: "I'm trying to protect my kids."
