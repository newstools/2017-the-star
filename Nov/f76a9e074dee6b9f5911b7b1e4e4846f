Jubilee’s Ruweida Obbo is poised to be the new Lamu woman rep. By yesterday, the little-known newcomer had garnered  23,093 votes against incumbent Shakilla Abdalla’s 13,374. The provisional results by the IEBC were from 166 out of 176 polling stations in the county. Abdalla had taken an early lead but was overtaken by Obbo (pictured) who has maintained a commanding lead. The incumbent has disputed the results, saying she was rigged out. In the closely contested Senate race, another newcomer Hassan Albeity of Wiper was leading with 14,359 votes, and was closely followed by Anwar Loitiptip of Jubilee with 14,165, according to the votes from 165 out of 167 polling stations. Loitiptip, a politically inexperienced young turk, floored incumbent Abu Chiaba at the Jubilee primaries. Chiaba has been in politics for more than two decades having started out as Lamu East MP between 1992 and 1997.
