The Malindi High Court
has dismissed a petition filed against the election of Kilifi woman representative Getrude
Mbeyu. It also ordered the petitioner Aziz Mohamed, a resident of the county, to pay Sh 2 million in costs of the suit. Lady Justice Asenath
Ongeri on Friday said the petitioner filed the petition
outside the stipulated time. She said
the court found out that the petitioner also filed two applications bearing the same date attached
on it. The judge said there was evidence
that the petitioner swapped the second petition with the first one, something she said is unacceptable.
 "What the petitioner did when he swapped the first petition for the second one is
unacceptable and for this reason, this court strikes out the second petition." "The petition must fail since the first one was removed from records. The same is accordingly dismissed with costs to the respondents." The judge earlier dismissed an application by the
petitioner seeking a scrutiny and recount of votes. She said the application was premature. "A petition becomes a
property of the court once it is filed and the only way the petitioner would
effect changes would be by way of amendment within 28 days," Ongeri said. Aziz accused IEBC and the county returning officer of committing irregularities in the declaration of ODM's Mbeyu as the winner. Lawyer Bwire Okano,
representing Mbeyu, argued that the petition was filed outside the stipulated time. The petitioner was ordered to pay the county
returning officer Sh1 million and another Sh1 million to the Kilifi woman rep.
