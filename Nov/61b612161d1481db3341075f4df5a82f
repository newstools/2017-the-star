The rains are expected again, after a one-week break.  The rains will spread this weekend, and intensify on Tuesday, the day of President Uhuru Kenyatta’s swearing-in.  Head of meteorological department Peter Ambenje noted the counties around Lake Victoria will experience showers and thunderstorms over several places in the afternoons over the next five days.  “Central Highlands, including the Nairobi area, will have cloudy mornings with rains over a few places, giving way to sunny intervals,” he said.  The rains will be heavier on Tuesday across Kenya.  At the Coast and the rest of the country, there will be rains over a few places throughout. The weatherman will issue another weather update on Tuesday. The rains could interfere with harvesting of food from the last season, which is ongoing in a few parts of the country.  “Harvesting is complete in all regions, except the North Rift that typically produces the majority of the production,” the Ministry of Agriculture said in the latest Food Security Outlook report released this week.  The ministry said production from the May-July long rains season is expected to drop by approximately 10 per cent.  The drop is attributed to a reduction in the area planted, such as in the North Rift, where after a dry spell, replanting had to be done.  Other factors include delayed onset of the rains, resulting in shorter growing periods, poor rainfall distribution, fall armyworm infestations, inadequate fertiliser application and attacks by maize lethal necrosis disease, particularly in Bomet and Narok counties. The report notes the current rains have only marginally improved food availability and about 5.6 million Kenyans are largely relying on food donations or have little left to eat.
