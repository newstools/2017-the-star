Exams in four schools in Mwingi started around 10am after heavy rains forced the exam papers to be airlifted on Monday. The exams in the four schools started late after the vehicle ferrying the exams was swept in River Karura. Officers in charge of the exams contacted the headquarters in Nairobi and a helicopter was dispatched. Nyanyaa, Mukuthu, Karura and Kaunguni schools started their exams minutes after other students had finished. Mwingi Central deputy county commissioner David Rotich said the vehicle is still stuck in the river. The same helicopter picked the written exam from the schools back to the county commissioner’s compound in the evening. The examination director in Mwingi did not speak to the press, saying they do not have authority to share information with the media.
