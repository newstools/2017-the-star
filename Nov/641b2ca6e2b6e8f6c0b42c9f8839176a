The Ministry of Environment says talks with the Kenya Association of Manufacturers over continued use of plastic bottles are at “advanced stages”. CS Judi Wakhungu told the Star on Monday at the UN Complex in Gigiri that her ministry has been “under pressure from Kenyans who want plastic bottles banned”. “There has been a lot of pressure on us to ban the plastic bottles, and people are even signing petitions. We have discussed this with the manufacturers as we are still managing the process of the plastic career bags ban,” Wakhungu said. Wakhungu pointed out that her ministry have been in discussions with the manufacturers on “a take back scheme such that the manufacturers and the recyclers will put up posts most likely where they are collecting the polythene bags.” “What we do is then encourage youth or other groups to collect the bottles which people are just throwing away, collect those bottles and then they would be paid per kilo of how many bottles they bring. This is what we are discussing now with the manufacturers,” Wakhungu, who was flanked by the National Environment Management Authority Director General Geoffrey Wahungu, said. The CS said the “manufacturers are very happy about this.” This means the number of new bottles being produced will be reduced even as the ministry seeks alternatives. She said the move is part of a circular economy strategy which aims to reduce and reuse plastics as much as possible.
