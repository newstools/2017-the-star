A Tanzanian court recently auctioned 1,305 Kenyan cows whose herders had driven them across the border in search of pasture during the drought. Four Kenyan herders – the owner of the cows and three elders – who had entered Tanzania were charged with being in the neighbouring country without valid travel documents. Tanzania remains the only East African Community country that Kenyans need a passport and visa to enter, even while travelling by road. On Sunday in Namanga, Tanzanian officials burnt to death 6,400 one-day-old chicks from Kenya, on suspicion they could spread bird flu. They said they had been smuggled from Kenya and arrested a Tanzanian businesswoman. One of the elders who had tried to intervene in the auctioning of the cattle remarked that his team had been received “with much hostility” in Tanzania. With an EAC neighbour like Tanzania, what are the chances for strengthening the common trading bloc and integration, to say nothing of political federation? The Tanzanians are behaving with astonishing hostility towards Kenya.
