Nakuru head coach Anthony Agesa believes it’s about time they put an end to Kenya Police unbeaten run as they prepare to host them at their backyard today in the Kenya Hockey Union (KHU) men’s Premier League contest. Police are yet to taste defeat in their 18 Premier League matches played this season and Agesa is confident his side has the abilities to silence the law enforcers guns. Agesa is counting on his side’s vast experience on natural surface as the sole advantage over the visitors.  He believes the pattern of victories drawn at home against the visiting clubs will not be spoiled by the on form Police. Nakuru sit tenth with 21 points. “Police is the best team in the league at the moment but we believe we have what it takes to stop them. I feel it’s the right time to stop them.” Today, defending champions Strathmore University Gladiators hope to ease their relegation worries when they face eighth-placed Parklands Sports Club.  The outgoing champions sit a slot higher from the red line and their two matches lined up for the weekend will be perfect in guarding their fading reputation.  Greensharks host cash-strapped Western Jaguars to complete the men premier league roster for the day.  In the ladies side, Strathmore University Scorpions play JKUAT while USIU-A confront Vikings.
