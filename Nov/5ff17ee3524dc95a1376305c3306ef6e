NGOs Coordination Board executive director Fazul Mahamed has been temporarily barred from summoning officials of the Katiba Institute over alleged involvement in money laundering. The temporary order was issued by High Court judge John Mativo, following a successful application by the Katiba Institute, through lawyer Suyianka Lempaa. The Katiba Institute moved to court after Fazul sent an email summoning the officials to his office, claiming they had
received complaints against the Institute to the effect that it could be
involved in activities bordering on money laundering. It was also alleged the Institute had some foreigners
working for it without permits. According to email from Fazul, the officials of the Institute
were to appear for a meeting at his office on November 6 in presence of officials
from Department of Immigration and the Financial Reporting Centre. The Katiba Institute says it is a company whose activities
are regulated under Companies Act and it is not registered under the Non-Governmental Organizations Act. Consequently, it says the NGO Board and Fazul have no
regulatory authority over it. The Institute accused Fazul of
acting outside his mandate by purporting to summon his clients. Lempaa also noted the action of Fazul is in total violation
of Article 31 of Constitution, which guarantees right to privacy. The Institute argues that if there is any criminal
allegations are made against it, the power to investigate is with
the police, not the NGO Board. The court was also told that linking the Institute to money
laundering will affect its ability to fund-raise, hence breaching its economic and
social right. The Katiba Institute argues that actions by Fazul are meant to
derail it or instil fear on its employees. The case will be heard on November 20.
