Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho and rival Hassan Omar yesterday came face-to-face during the hearing of a petition challenging the incumbent’s victory. Omar filed a petition challenging Joho’s election, urging the court to nullify the win and order for fresh polls. Omar, who was the first one to testify in the petition, said his loss was majorly caused by people confusing his name with that of his opponent. The former senator said the presiding officers at the tallying centres counted votes cast in his name as Joho’s. He said this was observed majorly since they both share the middle name ‘Hassan’. Omar said this was observed in several polling stations, though he did not name them. However, Omar told judge Lydia Achode he did not witness the alleged confusion and only relied on intelligence he received from his observers. He noted that he went back home and relaxed as he had faith the IEBC officials would carry out their mandate. Omar, who confessed to having not resigned from his former Wiper party, said at least 300 people were denied the right to exercise their democratic right to vote. The said people however did not file an affidavit to the allegations. He also claimed ballot stuffing, issuing of multiple ballot papers and irregularities in counting and tallying of votes. Omar said the IEBC declined to provide Forms 37A, citing it would be expensive for them. He said the IEBC claimed it will cost Sh8 million to print the forms and therefore he had to print them by himself. He said the forms were put on a flashdisk before he printed them at his office. Omar called on the court to replicate what happened at the Supreme Court if it’s proven there were irregularities in the August 8 polls. He said Mombasa was majorly featured in the NASA case against the IEBC and the Jubilee petition at the Supreme Court and therefore Ochode should observe that fact. The hearing continues.
