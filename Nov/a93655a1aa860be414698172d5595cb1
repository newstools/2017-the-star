The Suba community in Homa Bay county has threatened to sue Governor Cyprian Awiti, citing exclusion in the list of county executives names forwarded to the assembly. The community claims the list beats the objective of devolution and goes against statutory provisions in the County Governments Act as it is not inclusive or reflective of the ethnic composition of Homa Bay. Through Nyauchi and Company Advocates, the community wants the nomination of Nicholus Koriko(Finance) Prof Richard Muga (Health). David Okeyo(Transport), Carelus Ademba (Trade), Alfonce Wera(Energy) rescinded. Other nominees are Beatrice Oyomo (Lands), Roseline Odhiambo (Tourism), Beatrice Asyago(Education), Aguko Juma (Agriculture) and Dickson Nyawinda (Water). According to Lawrence Magwar, an interested party, the governor exercised his mandate to nominate, but did so in total disregard to the cultural, religious and ethnic diversity in Homa Bay county. “The list, therefore, falls short of what the law clearly prescribes and thus should be dismissed to be amended by the author to conform to every provision of the existing laws of the land,” hd said. Magwar said Asyago is married to a Suba though she is a Luo, adding ethnicity is not defined by marriage. “Your formation of the new government does not contain a promise to have an inclusive administration, therefore, the fear you may intentionally sideline, in terms of development, these groups, is growing,” he said.
