As many as four children aged between 8-18 years are raped every day at in Mombasa, Kilifi and Kwale counties, according to a specialist in reproductive health at the Coast General Hospital. This translates to 120 cases a month, and 1,440 cases a year in the three counties alone. Alice Maundu, who works in the hospital’s Obstetrics and Gynecology department’s Gender-Based Violence and Recovery Centre, most cases reported involve children aged between 8-18 years. “The number may go up to six a day, especially on Mondays. Mondays, we are so busy. In fact, whoever works there ends up not attending to any other case in the hospital,” said Maundu. She spoke on Saturday during a session with victims of rape and gender-based violence organized by Sisters for Justice and Haki Africa organizations in Kongowea.
