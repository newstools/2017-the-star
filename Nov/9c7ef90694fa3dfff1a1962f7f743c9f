Six people escaped death in Webuye town on
Monday after a lorry rammed onto a video show shop. The six were taken to Webuye Subcounty Hospital. They suffered broken limbs. The brakes of the lorry that was carrying
construction material are said to have failed. One of those seriously injured was a disabled cobbler,
who was repairing his customer’s shoes outside the video shop. Greengrocer Betty Akoth said she saw the lorry also hit several motorcycles as the riders ran for their lives. "I saw the lorry veer of the road and people scampered to safety," she said.   Residents have asked police to erect road bumps at
the place. Bungoma East police boss Zacheeus Ng'eno said they are yet to establish the cause of the accident. He said the six, who have been rushed to hospital, are in critical condition. Webuye East subcounty administrator Ronald Jumbe
said the accident is the third to occur in the area this year. "We are lucky that today was not a market day and there were fewer people around," he said.
