NGO Save the Children has urged Kenya to increase immunisation against pneumonia in remote counties. It released a report yesterday indicating close to one million children a year die from pneumonia globally. Pneumonia is the biggest killer in Kenya and in 2015 killed 22,473 Kenyans last year in total, up from 21,640 in 2013, with the major fatalities being among children under five years. The report showed if the current trajectory on pneumonia deaths continues to 2030, the commitment to end preventable child deaths will be impossible. New data presented in the report shows using current trends, 735,000 children will still die of pneumonia globally by 2030, which is the target date set for the realisation of sustainable development goals.  The goals include a collective pledge to end preventable child deaths. “Almost all of these deaths are eminently preventable. Yet pneumonia fatalities are falling more slowly than for any other major killer of children. The disease accounts for more child deaths than diarrhea, malaria and measles combined,” the report states. The report called ‘Fighting for Breath’ recommended the prevention of pneumonia deaths through universal vaccination. Many children are denied the benefits of vaccination against pneumonia, including 170 million children aged 0–2 years in developing countries. Antibiotics, which could prevent 70 per cent of pneumonia deaths, are also frequently not accessible and often unavailable.
