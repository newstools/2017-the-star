Award wining rapper King Kaka is set to headline a concert whose main aim is to bridge the gap following the political differences in the country. The rapper will headline the Colour Festival Paintball edition on December 17 and will bring together the business community in an arena of fun and team building. Speaking exclusively to Word Is, Marto Cliq said, "The festival will bridge gaps of tribalism, overcome racism, religious divisions and will clear the political differences that have been created and left behind by the long political battles experienced in the country this year."  He added, "The main purpose of the event will be to celebrate diversity because when somebody is splashed with water-based powder colours, the whole body is covered in colour. Our pigmentation disappears, making us all equal.” Cliq Entertainment runs a DJ Academy in Meru.
