 The Luo Council of Elders yesterday said they will cut links with any community leader who associates with Jubilee. They were addressing the press in Siaya town. Organising secretary Owino Nyadi said as a community, they will strive to achieve their aspirations. Anyone going against their desires will be shunned. He regretted that some members of the community are in talks with Jubilee leaders to form a post-election pact. “We won’t welcome such leaders in our midst,” Nyadi said. He said the community has demonstrated selflessness in advocating the democratic space that Kenyans are enjoying. Nyadi said they won’t support talks by self-seekers and Jubilee. The elders said they will only recognise NASA leader Raila Odinga as their national leader. They do not recognise the October 26 presidential rerun, the elders said.
