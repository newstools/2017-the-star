Even after being charged with a criminal slur of President Uhuru Kenyatta during a rally in Kitui town last month, Mwingi Central MP Gideon Mulyungi is facing another legal suit. Mulyungi denied two hate speech charges, one of uttering a statement that being a member of the Kamba community he had a “bigger manhood” than that of the President who is a Kikuyu. The case will be heard by Kitui principal magistrate Jonson Munguti on November 23. But ambassador Kiema Kilonzo wants to institute a civil defamation suit against the MP for remarks he allegedly made during a Kitui meeting attended by Governor Charity Ngilu and Senator Enoch Wambua. In a letter, Kiema’s lawyer Eric Mutua has accused Mulyungi of saying, “There [are] some men who have became gay, one of them is called Kiema Kilonzo and the other is an old man to whom it has not dawned that he is old, who has also became gay......” The lawyer said the utterances meant his client was gay and of a questionable moral standing. Mutua said the words had injured his client’s credit, character, calling as a diplomat and reputation. He demanded that Mulyungi publishes an apology in a nationally circulating newspaper and YouTube and offer to pay an appropriate sum of money in damages.
