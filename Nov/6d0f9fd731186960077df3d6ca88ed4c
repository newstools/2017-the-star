Horticultural farmers from Mungyani Kakutha and Kyemundu locations in Mbitini, Nzaui subcounty, yesterday urged the county and the national governments to rehabilitate the roads. They were washed away following heavy rains that have lasted one week. Speaking at Kakuyuni trading centre, farmer Gervas Kisingu said the roads are in deplorable state and need urgent rehabilitation. Kisingu said their products rot in their farms and by the road due to lack of proper transport to the Mombasa–Nairobi highway. The worst roads are those of Mungyani, Kithumani, Mbenuu, Mulala-Emali, Matiliku-Kitulani–Mbenuu. Areas in Manooni, Tearoom, Mutyambua, Kavuthu and Sultan Hamud are also affected. “Tomatoes and cabbages worth millions of shillings are rotting in the farms due to lack of customers,” Kisingu added. The farmers appealed to Governor Kivutha Kibwana to send tractors to repair the roads. Reached for comment, Kibwana said the Roads executive will visit the area and assess. Kibwana assured the farmers that the worst roads will be repaired immediately the rains become lighter.
