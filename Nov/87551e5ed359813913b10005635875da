NASA yesterday criticised President Uhuru Kenyatta’s plan to appoint members of the Cabinet from opposition strongholds, hoping to unite the country. They said the plan will fail. The opposition legislator said Kenyans in the opposition are interested in equal distribution of resources, respect and good governance.  They said political goodies will not transform the economy and improve the welfare of the poor masses. “We have had many Luos, Kambas, people from the Coast, Kisiis and Luhyas in Cabinets since Independence. Appointing them to the Cabinet has never united the country or solved our problems,” Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi said in a phone interview. NASA was responding to the President and his close allies’ remarks that they will appoint individuals from NASA zones into senior positions as part of their strategy to unite the country. They said tribalism, corruption and nepotism are entrenched in the Jubilee administration. The NASA members want Uhuru to call for fresh elections so that a new team takes over the leadership to address historical injustices. “Instead of division, I know that we can build a Kenya which prospers by rewarding hard work, and leaving no one behind,” Uhuru said at Kasarani on Tuesday during his inauguration. The NASA members said they do not recognise Uhuru’s presidency and will continue to push for his resignation. NASA stressed that the country will come together after the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission report and the Ndungu’ Land report are implemented. They added that the government must address historical injustices and push for electoral justice.
