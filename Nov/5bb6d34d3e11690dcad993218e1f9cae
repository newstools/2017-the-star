Travellers planning to use the Hindi-Kiunga road in Lamu will have to notify security officers, but the road is considered generally safe from terror attacks. The road was closed last year and declared a no-go zone by security agencies involved in the Linda Boni Security Operation. It has been renamed the Boni Enclave Campaign to flush out al Shabaab terrorists. Boni Enclave Campaign director Joseph Kanyiri (pictured) yesterday said residents are free to use the road, but have to notify police and comply with security checks. No security officers will escort travellers, he said. There have been frequent IED attacks targetting passengers and security officers using the road. The more than 250km road is the only land route that connects to the rest of Lamu. Residents have been relying on water transport.
