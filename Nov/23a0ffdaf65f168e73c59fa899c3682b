Mombasa woman representative Asha Hussein can now breathe easy after a petition challenging her election was thrown out. The Mombasa High Court yesterday dismissed the petition on technical grounds. Judge Mugure Thande said the petitioner had contravened the rule of the petition after he served it on an eight-year old son of the MP. Thande said the petitioner, Saad Yusuf Saad, ought to have personally served Hussein herself or an advocate representing her. The judge also observed that Saad had failed to alternatively advertise the filing of the petition in a national newspaper as required by law. Saad had wanted the court nullify Hussein’s election and order for a fresh poll. Justice Thande said the petitioner had also failed to indicate the date when the disputed election was conducted. “The petitioner failed to comply with rule 8 and 12 of the election petition.Therefore the petition is incurably defective and hereby struck out,” Thande said.
