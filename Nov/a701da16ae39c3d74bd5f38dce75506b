Poultry farmers in Kiambu county are ditching old farming methods for modern ways to increase production. Farmer Mary Wangare yesterday said many poultry farmers have changed tack owing to losses they incur due to lack of information. She imported chicken layer cages from Norway, so she raises 4,500 chicken in an 83-by- 34 foot chicken house. Wangare says each cage houses five chickens, making it easy to feed, water and collect eggs. She spoke in Red Hill, Limuru constituency. Wangare says triangular cages keep chickens clean since they don’t drop waste on each other. They drink water from special taps fitted inside the cages. “The chicken layer cages are economical, keeping birds clean and saving a lot of space,” she said. “You cannot raise over 1,000 birds in an open poultry house in a small space. They kill each other,” Wangare said. She called for lower feed prices, veterinary services and more training.
