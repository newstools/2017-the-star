The chief government legal adviser has asked the Supreme Court to allow him join the petition challenging President Uhuru Kenyatta’s October 26 victory. Attorney General Githu Muigai wants to come on board in the case as an interested party and not amicus curiae (friend of the court). As an interested party, he will support Kenyatta’s case, whereas if he asked to join as friend of the court, he will only argue issues touching on law without taking sides. The petition against Uhuru was filed by two activists – Njonjo Mue and Khelef Khalif. In his application filed yesterday, the AG said the national government has direct and legitimate interest in the case and he wants to be a party. According to the AG, the two activists challenging the President’s victory, have raised some grave allegations directly touching on the role played by state and public officers regarding the manner of their participation in the conduct of the fresh election. Also raised in the petition are allegations of improper influence during the conduct of the election, through use of government delivery portal and abuse of power by Interior CS Fred Matiang’i in the declaration of October 25 as a public holiday. The application by the AG was supported by affidavits, among them one from Matiang’i. In a sworn affidavit, Matiang’i denied deploying the KDF during the election period. He further said he had information from police boss Joseph Boinnet that there were no reports of persons dressed in police uniform, raping women or committing assault.
