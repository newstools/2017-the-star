The Kenyatta family welcomed their newest member of the family on Sunday. President Uhuru Kenyattaâ€™s first son, Jomo Kenyatta and wife Fiona Achola Ngobi welcomed a baby girl. The baby, born at the Aga Khan University Hospital has been named Wanjiru, according to sources.  Achola and Jomo wed last year in November in a traditional wedding held in Gatundu. Their relationship has been hush hush to a point where not many people outside of their close-knit family knew that Achola was heavy with child. This news hit the headlines after she was spotted in the company of her hubby and the First Lady Margaret Kenyatta shopping at the Marula Manor last week.  Reports claim that the grandfather showed up at the hospital minutes after the baby was born and we are told he was very happy and was even dancing after he met her. Sources claim. "He also took lots of selfies with the doctors and nurses as well as baby Wanjiru." As usual, there was also heavy security presence in the VIP wing where Achola was admitted. Achola is said to be recovering well. Congratulations to Achola and Jomo.
