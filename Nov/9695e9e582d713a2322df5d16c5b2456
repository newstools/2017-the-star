The High Court has extended a temporary order barring the police and the DPP from arresting and charging Dagorettti North MP Simba Arati over Kawangware skirmishes. Justice Chacha Mwita extended the order to be in force until February 21. He gave the order last Friday when the MP moved to court. Arati filed a certificate of urgency arguing that his impeding arrest is unlawful. Through his lawyer James Orengo, Arati said the arrest is malicious and an abuse of police powers. He said he was not questioned over the destruction of property and breach of peace in Kawagware on October 27 . In his ruling last week, Mwita said the MP was hospitalised and it would be a violation of his rights to arrest him while he sought treatment. In his petition, Arati also asked the court to grant him anticipatory bail, but the judge declined, directing them to appear in court on Friday for further direction. The legislator said he has received a lot of animosity from mostly Jubilee supporters, ranging from threatening text messages and cyber attacks. These incidents have contributed to his deteriorating health, he said.
