The County Government of Trans Nzoia will relocate its dumping site from Machinjoni estate to Bidii on the outskirts of Kitale town. Environment executive Godfrey Wekesa said Machinjoni is close to a stream and a recently established slaughterhouse. The dumpsite poses health risks. Machinjoni is on 10 acres and has been used as a dumpsite by Kitale residents for decades. “Bidii which is 12 acres is away from human habitation,” he said. Speaking in his office on Friday Wekesa said they will be procuring compartment waste bins in the next financial year as a move to manage wastes generated in town.  Wekesa said the county government will establish an integrated solid waste management system and later a waste management plant. “Waste that would not be decomposed, treated or recycled would be incinerated. We are looking for partners to help us fund the projects,” h said. “The county government disposes off 20-30 percent of waste at Machinjoni dumpsite, while the rest is collected by the private sector,”  Wekesa said.
