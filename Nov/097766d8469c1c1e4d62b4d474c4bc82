Gatundu South residents went wild on Monday with song and dance after IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati declared President Uhuru Kenyatta winner of presidential rerun. At Uhuru’s rural home in Ichaweri, hundreds of supporters from as far as Githurai and Thika gathered outside the gate to celebrate.  Businesses closed early. Restaurants were swamped by residents keen to follow proceedings at the National Tallying Centre at the Bomas of Kenya, Nairobi. Soon after the announcement, residents broke into songs and dance. The young and the old forgot about differences, danced a jig, sang pro-Jubilee songs, chanted slogans and knelt in prayers on major roads. They blocked the roads and caused traffic jams.  Some carried loaves of bread to signify the President will not be sharing power with NASA in a ‘mkata nusu’ or half-loaf, coalition government. Others carried placards saying, ‘The storm is now over’ — an indication of the relief the victory meant for them. They told NASA leader to allow Uhuru to serve his second and final term. It is the decision of the majority who went to the polls on August 8 and October 26, they added. Campaigner Boniface Wanyoike said, “Raila may run back to the Supreme Court to challenge this win. We’re telling him not to waste his time. The will of the people has been exhibited during the August 8 and repeat polls.”  Trader Jane Wambui hopes calm and normalcy will return soon. Gatundu JP chairman David Ngubia congratulated Uhuru.
