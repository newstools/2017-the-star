A driver was yesterday seriously injured after his lorry was involved in an accident at the Rironi area along the busy Nairobi-Nakuru highway. Limuru OCPD Eunice Githure said the lorry rammed another lorry which was leaving the highway. Witnesses said the lorry abruptly slowed down, leaving little chance for the driver to apply the breaks. "It was diverting from the highway into a feeder road," Samuel Gitau said. A police vehicle was scratched during the accident. "It's only the driver of the lorry who was injured," Githure said. The injured driver was transporting poles while the other lorry was transporting animal feeds. They were both towed to the Tigoni police station.
