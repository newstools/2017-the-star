The perennial traffic jam in Thika town will end when construction of two bypasses is completed.  Construction is set to start soon.  The government, through the Kenya Urban Roads Authority, has allocated Sh1.5 billion to the project.  Residents have for several years grappled with frequent jams. In the first phase, a 10km bypass starting from Garissa road via Kivulini-Kisii-Kiganjo-Athena-Witeithie to Thika Superhighway will be built.  In the second phase, the 15km Kenyatta Highway-Munene industries-UTI-Pilot-Umoja to Kenyatta-Garissa road will be put up.  The project will also include a 40m-wide bridge at the Haile Selassie Road, near the Blue Post Hotel. Jacinta Mwangi, Kuraâ€™s Central region manager, last Friday said the two bypasses will be completed in 24 months.  Senior surveyor Victor Biko said motorists heading to Garissa or those from Nyeri, Embu or Meru will not need to pass through the town.
