Paul Karanja and Ahmed Abdi harvested heavily in the BetPawa Jackpot after investing a single shilling. Karanja won Sh3.8m while Abdi pocketed Sh2.3 million for placing multibets. Karanja placed bets on Friday picking 26 teams and 20 matches in a stake of a shilling while his fellow millionaire Abdi placed a multi bet, staking 4 bob in his first attempt where he won Sh342,674 in 20 games. In the second bet, Abdi staked a shilling, picking 26 games and consequently bagged Sh1,986,492. The two were handed their cheques yesterday at the betPawa Kenya offices in Nairobi where they expressed their delight with the wins, terming them mind blowing. The firm’s CEO Dos Kariuki warned gamblers to be responsible in their betting. He insisted that the one shilling policy helps gamblers bet responsibly in the sense that it does not affect them financially. Kariuki further advised gamblers to follow the company’s financial advice once they get lucky.  “This helps them to wisely account for their money as most winners don’t have the know-how of responsible investing. The company goes an extra mile to follow up on the winners to confirm that they made wise investment decisions.” Save from the two winners, the firm revealed other two preceding winners who won Sh100, 170 and ksh 700, 000 after placing their bets with a stake of a single shilling.
