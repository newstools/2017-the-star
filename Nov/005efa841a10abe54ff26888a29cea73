NASA leaders have said they are systematically pushing for a people’s revolution which will sweep away President Uhuru Kenyatta and Jubilee. They say if Uhuru is declared the winner, then NASA’s only option would be to swear in its leader Raila Odinga.  They continued with their electoral justice campaign and questioned the legitimacy of Uhuru’s disputed reelection. Siaya Senator James Orengo said Uhuru’s reelection for a second term is at stake on grounds that no world leader or Western diplomat has congratulated him.  Orengo warned that Raila, through his National Resistance Movement, is pushing for a revolution against Uhuru, which the Jubilee leadership is taking lightly. “We are using the law and the Constitution in this revolution. During the Kanu regime we wanted multi-partyism, but President Daniel Moi said no. Then we went to the people - did we get multi-partyism or not?” Orengo said in Jacaranda Grounds, Nairobi, on Sunday. He cited NASA’s People’s Assembly in the counties move to pass motions of no confidence against Uhuru as part of the revolution. The senator said NASA will swear in Raila if Uhuru is sworn in. Orengo was with former senators Johnson Muthama (Machakos) and Boni Khalwale (Kakamega). Elected MPs present were Gladys Wanga (Homa Bay woman representative), Opiyo Wandayi (Ugunja), Raphael Wanjala (Budalang’i), George Aladwa (Makadara) and Babu Owino (Embakasi East). “One of resolutions in the motions passed in the county assemblies says someone elected by 30 per cent of voters cannot be recognised as the President.  Stand up firm for your right by saying enough is enough. We must reach Canaan,” Orengo said. The leaders asked their supporters to turn up in large numbers on Thursday to welcome Raila at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport as he arrives from the US.
