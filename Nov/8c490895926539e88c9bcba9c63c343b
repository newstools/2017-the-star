More than 1,000 people who use ordinary boats to transport goods from beaches along Lake Victoria in Port Victoria have praised the revival of ferry services to Sigulu Island in Uganda. This was after a ferry company from Scotland revived ferry transport in Lake Victoria. The services had stalled years back due to a misunderstanding between the company and immigration officials from Uganda. The operations director of Globology Lake Ferry Services Ltd, Jan Teertstra, said the 10-tonne ferry can carry 100 passengers. Jan spoke to the Star on Thursday on Marenga and Omena beaches after meeting the ferry with high ranking officials from Busia. He said the purpose of reviving the ferry services is to enable the travellers to reach their destinations in good time at an affordable cost. Â
