Meru MCAs have asked Inspector General Joseph Boinnet to restrain police from arresting miraa users, vendors or traders. This followed the directive by NACADA restricting the use of the drug to between 5pm to 10pm. Deputy speaker Elius Murega, Kiegoi MCA Kimathi Ithibua, David Kaithia (Akithi), Priscilla Kithia (Nkomo) led the calls. They said that since President Uhuru Kenyatta assented to the Bill legalising miraa as a cash crop, any restrictions is against the law. The leaders condemned the anti-drug agency for setting the 5pm-10pm timeline saying it is a selfish move. "We ask our people who love and enjoy chewing miraa not to be worried, intimidated or harassed," Ithibua said. He said that if NACADA continues fighting the crop, they will shut down any of its dealings in the region. The leaders said miraa remains the source of livelihood for the residents hence will not allow any interference. The crop is largely grown in Igembe South, Igembe North, Igembe Central, Tigania East and Tigania West. "You cannot restrict or regulate miraa chewing because the business booms from as early as 4am every day." But Meru Sports CEC Daniel Kiogora said miraa chewing eats into the productivity of the youth hence should be regulated. "I know people who have been chewing miraa for years. When they start chewing in the morning, they chew till evening." "Let it be regulated in the same way as other leisure substances," Kiogora said.
