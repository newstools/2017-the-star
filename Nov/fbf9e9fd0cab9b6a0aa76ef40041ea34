Many Siaya residents have migrated to using Airtel lines after NASA called for the boycott of telecommunications firm Safaricom’s products. This is after the alliance accused Safaricom of supporting Jubilee. On Monday, Airtel shops were buzzing with activity as residents thronged the premises. NASA leader Raila Odinga bought an Airtel card in Nairobi. Resident Fred Onyango said locals do not question ‘Baba’s’ (Raila’s) decisions. “Now that we have seen our leader at the Airtel shop, that automatically means Airtel is now the better option and not Safaricom,” he said. Onyango added the migration will continue for every product Raila says should be boycotted.
