Hallelujah! God has given Kenya hope and a future with the Supreme Court ruling, DP William Ruto has said. Ruto was reacting to Monday's ruling that upheld President Uhuru Kenyatta's win after petitions filed against him were dismissed. "Hallelujah! Glory to God in heaven. He has remembered our nation, given us hope and a future," he said via Twitter on Monday. He added "Wakenya jameni mbarikiwe mpaka mshangae (Kenyans, may you be so blessed that it leaves you shocked)." Celebrations erupted in Rift Valley and Central regions after the Supreme Court verdict. But in Kisumu, youths stoned and burnt a vehicle in protest over the ruling. Kisumu is among four counties that did not participate in the repeat election on October 26. Others are Migori, Homa Bay and Siaya, which are opposition strongholds. NASA leader Raila Odinga's said his perception of the government as 'illegitimate" has not changed with the Supreme Court's verdict.  The court dismissed two key cases - one by former Kilome MP Harun Mwau and the other by activists Njonjo Mue (International Commission of Jurists) and Khelef Khalifa (Muslims for Human Rights). "The court has unanimously determined that the petitions are not merited," Chief Justice David Maraga ruled on Monday, after considerations by the six-judge bench. "The presidential election is upheld."  More on this: Maraga upholds election, Uhuru to be sworn-in on November 28 Also read: Supreme Court was under duress, Uhuru reign illegitimate - Raila
