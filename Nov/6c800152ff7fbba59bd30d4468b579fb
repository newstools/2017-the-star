Pope Francis has appointed Kitale Catholic Bishop Maurice Crowley to act as Bishop of Eldoret following the death of Bishop Cornelius Korir. Crowley will be the apostolic administrator of the diocese until a new bishop is named by the Pope. Pope Francis has written to the diocese over the appointment of Bishop Crowley to oversee the church activities in Eldoret. Korir died on October 30. He had diabetes and high blood pressure. Vicar General of the diocese Fr William Korir confirmed the appointment. During Korir’s burial, the church had announced it will appoint an acting bishop. The Pope’s representative to Kenya, Archbishop Charles Balvo said finding a replacement is a lengthy process. He said, “I now have a major task to look for a new bishop and that will not be easy.”
