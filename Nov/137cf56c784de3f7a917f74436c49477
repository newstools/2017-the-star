Kenyans are masters at trolling personalities. Larry Madowo was at the tail end of comments by these trolls after he posted a congratulatory message to Amina Abdi. Fans or haters saw this as a chance to ask Madowo why he hasn't married yet. ignatiusalusa: Basi hata larry chukua huyo uoe. Weka yeye kwa nyumba Coolbrown Ashley: Luo Bae Unapenda kukaa karibu na waschana lakini hautaki kuoa, Steve Wa Macharia: So many ladies and still you cook for yourself!! or you don't know that sweet potatoes are found beneath the surface?? Cherono Marindany: Larry Madowo let me save you the torture of cyber bullying si unioe hii story iishe. Mohammed TheBishop: Larry unatuangusha sisi kama wanaume.. Wewe kila wakati nikuwekwe friendzone hakuna demu anaeza kunoki? Kwani ulifanyia nini Mungu??
