Former Laikipia North MP Mathew Lempurkel has moved to court seeking orders to stop police from killing residents’ livestock. This comes a week after 300 cattle were killed during a police raid. Lempurkel also wants the government to compensate the pastoralists whose animals were confiscated, killed or maimed. The former MP said police have been conducting security operations in Laikipia. Property has been destroyed and people’s lives disrupted. He wants the court to stop Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet and acting Interior CS Fred Matiang’i from interfering with the grazing of livestock by pastoralists on community land in the county. Lempurkel said the pastoralist community has no alternative source of income and depends solely on its livestock. He said many residents have been left destitute.  Lempurkel argues pastoralists in Laikipia are marginalised. They are unable to fully participate in nation-building. The former MP said when British colonialists came to Kenya, they displaced the community and forced it into two reserves in Laikipia and near the border with Tanzania.  He wants a declaration from court that the confiscation, killing and seizure in Laikipia is unconstitutional.   Lempurkel also wants an order directing Boinnet and Matiang’i to ensure security of the pastoralists and their livestock in Laikipia.
