Trans Nzoia Governor Patrick Khaemba (pictured) will know next month the verdict of a petition challenging his victory. Justice Anthony Murima yesterday said the ruling will be on December 7. The final ruling will be whether the scrutiny of votes should be done or not. Two voters — Robinson Mwanga and Alfa Chore — are challenging Khaemba’s victory on August 8.  “I will decide the ruling based on law. I will not be intimidated by anyone,” Murima said. Through his lawyer Peter Wanyama, the governor had asked Justice Murima to dismiss the application on votes scrutiny and recount. He said this followed the petitioners failure to name specific polling stations to be scrutinised and the reason. “There has been no complaint from any candidate regarding the tally at the polling stations. Therefore, this cannot form the basis of vote scrutiny,” the lawyer said.
