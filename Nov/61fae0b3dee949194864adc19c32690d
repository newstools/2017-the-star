Navakholo MP Emmanuel Wangwe has asked NASA chief Raila Odinga to abandon his push for a transition government. He said, instead, Raila should focus on constitutional amendment, to end the winner-takes-it-all scenario, through expansion of the executive. Raila wants President Uhuru Kenyatta to step aside and pave the way for the formation of a six-month transition arrangement to midwife reforms in the electoral system before a fresh, free, fair and credible election is held. But Wangwe said Raila’s call for a temporary government is ill-advised. He said what is needed at the moment is comprehensive constitutional amendments to end the winner-takes-it-all situation created under the new Constitution and which raises tension every election time. Wangwe said the talk of a transition government should only surface after the ruling by the Supreme Court on three petitions challenging Uhuru’s victory in the October 26 repeat presidential poll. NASA co-principal Musalia Mudavadi on Saturday said the opposition has resorted to invoking the “people’s power” as a means of pushing for electoral reforms. “We will soon seek to ensure the people’s power is felt. Jubilee intends to use its numerical strength in Parliament and this is what we want to tame,” Mudavadi told a funeral in Vihiga on Saturday. Wangwe said the law should be reviewed to create a platform for the runners up in the presidential elections as official leaders of the opposition.
