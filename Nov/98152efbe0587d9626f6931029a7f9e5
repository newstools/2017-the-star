National Super Alliance leader Raila Odinga has left the country for the United States. He left Nairobi shortly after 4pm for Washington DC where he scheduled to meet various leaders and address a public forum. Raila will deliver a speech at the Centre for Security and International Studies (CSIS). He is scheduled to hold meetings with House and Senate Congressional Committee officials among other leaders on Wednesday. The Opposition leader will address CSIS on Thursday morning and hold more meetings with other leaders and officials of civil society organizations. Spokesman Dennis Onyango said the NASA leader will speak on "Overcoming Kenyaâ€™s Political Crisis and Advancing Democracy, Rule of Law and Stability." "Raila is scheduled to return to Nairobi over the weekend," Onyango said. The opposition chief left the country at a time his fellow principals in the coalition started dispatching motions for the creation of people's assemblies. The groups will be used to push for a national conversation on the electoral process with a view of delegitimising President Uhuru Kenyatta's win in last month's vote.
