Sammy Kitwara set a massive Spanish all-comers’ record at the Maraton Valencia Trinidad Alfonso yesterday. The 31-year-old Kenyan produced a 2:05:15 effort to finish almost a full minute inside the previous record, moving to seventh on this year’s world list in the process. Ethiopia’s Aberu Mekuria Zennebe won the women’s race in 2:26:17 to improve on her fourth-place finish from last year. The 33-year-old finished almost a minute ahead of Belarusian Volha Mazuronak. Boosted by five pacemakers, the men’s opening splits were quite fast with the large lead group going through the 5km and 10km points in 14:54 and 29:46 respectively. By then, all the main favourites – Kenya’s Evan Chebet, Emmanuel Mutai and Sammy Kitwara – ran close together in ideal weather conditions of 12C and no wind. The main pacemakers, Kenyans Kilimo Rhonzas and Daniel Muteti, led the leading group to successive splits of 44:41 for 15km and 1:02:46 at halfway. With 10 athletes still in the lead group, hopes were high that the winning time would be well inside the 2:06:13 course record. The 25-kilometre point was reached in 1:14:32 and shortly afterwards Mutai, a 2:03:13 performer back in 2014, became the first notable athlete to fall back. The rhythm even heated up in the following 5km section which was covered in a frantic 14:38 for an overall time of 1:29:10 at 30km with Kitwara running comfortably in the lead. That increase of speed whittled down the leading pack from 10 to five men in the guise of Kitwara, Chebet, Ethiopian duo Aberu Kuma Lema and Deribe Robi Melka plus Eritrea’s Samuel Tsegay. The key movement came at 33km when Kitwara and Chebet pulled easily away from the rest of the heading group to open a sizeable margin over the Ethiopians and Tsegay, who had taken a fall which hampered his effort from then on. The Kenyan pair went through the 35km in 1:44:18 to suggest a Spanish all-comers’ record was more than likely as they had a big 45-second margin on the previous best. Kitwara broke away from Chebet at exactly the 39km point to face the closing three kilometres in solitude. The long-legged Kenyan ran majestically during the closing stages to gradually increase his lead over Chebet, while Lema and Melka got rid of Tsegay in the fight for the third place on the podium. Once inside the final kilometre, the only question mark remaining was whether Kitwara would be capable to finish inside 2:05. Although he finished 15 seconds outside that barrier, his eventual winning time of 2:05:15 was still 58 seconds ahead of the previous all-comers’ record set in 2015. Having failed to finish his three other marathon attempts this year (Boston, Berlin, Amsterdam), Kitwara finally achieved his target of completing a fast effort. Today’s clocking of 2:05:15 is his second quickest time to date, bettered only by the 2:04:28 he ran in Chicago three years ago. He also ran the second half faster than the opening one, 1:02:46 and 1:02:29 his respective halves. “Despite my previous DNFs this season, I knew I was in very good shape and I finally managed to prove it here in Valencia,” said Kitwara, who will turn 32 next Sunday. “I felt very comfortable throughout and managed to finish very strongly.” Chebet finished 15 seconds behind Kitwara, taking one second off his PB with 2:05:30. Melka prevailed over Lema in the battle for third place, 2:06:38 and 2:06:44 their respective performances. In addition to Kitwara’s record, the race also witnessed the best ever depth on Spanish soil as six men finished within 2:08:00.
