  The National Council of Churches of Kenya, Lamu branch, has raised concerns about the rise in the number of youths using hard drugs, adding they are easy prey for al Shabaab recruiters. Lamu NCCK chairman Charles Herya said the trend is dangerous. Speaking on Friday, he said the majority of youths using drugs are uneducated and unemployed, making them easy targets for militia groups who promise them a good life. Herya called for concerted efforts from religious and community leaders as well as security officials to end the problem. He said, “The number of young people who are on drugs is alarming and everybody should be concerned. It’s not good for security and the economy of any given region. We must do something before we regret. It’s not too late.” Herya accused the county and national governments of turning a blind eye to the fact that many people in Lamu are poor and cannot educate their children beyond standard eight. He said both the county and national governments need to set aside a kitty to help children from marginalised regions like Lamu pursue higher education. Herya said, “If they cannot go to school,  they will definitely find something else to do.”
