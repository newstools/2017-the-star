Kitui  Governor Charity Ngilu yesterday ordered  county chief officers who served under her predecessor Julius Malombe to vacate office and take leave, pending retirement. County  secretary Alex Kimanzi appears to have  survived the purge, however, as Ngilu issued letters directing all the 11 chief  officers. The decision follows last week’s advertisement for 14 chief officer jobs. The  vacancy of the  county  secretary was also advertised. “The move follows the advertisement of their jobs at the expiry of their contracts to allow Governor Ngilu to appoint their successors,” a brief from the governor’s communications office said. The governor’s move came a week after the swearing in of eight CEC members at the Kitui Kefri Centre on Tuesday last week. “It’s understood the decision is meant to make room for the new executives to settle without unnecessary interference from the chief officers appointed by Governor Julius Malombe,” the statement added.
