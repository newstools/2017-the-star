Divers and experts have failed to recover three bodies and wreckage of a helicopter that crashed in Lake Nakuru on October 21. More than 40 divers, six geologists, investigators and other experts with sophisticated equipment have been searching for more than 12 hours a day for 27 days. The search involves sonar equipment from the Kenya Navy and two magnetometers from the Geothermal Development Company and the Mining ministry. “Each day, we wake up energised and ready for the search mission but in the evening, we are a discouraged lot because the search seems to bear no fruit,” Moses Owala said yesterday. Owala, 50, is one of the divers from the Kenya Rescue Divers. “We’ve never taken a break since we arrived. I’ve been talking to my family, but I’ve not seen them for almost a month. My close friend died, but I could not give him a sendoff because we want to complete this mission first,” he said. Nine divers pulled out because they could no longer afford to pay for their own accommodation and other expenses.
