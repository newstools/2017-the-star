NASA will swear in its chief Raila Odinga if President Uhuru Kenyatta is sworn in for a second term following the disputed repeat polls. The opposition said it does not recognise the October 26 repeat polls. “As the Opposition we demand that they open the servers for the August 8 general polls so that we can declare Raila the fifth President of the Republic of Kenya,” said Siaya Senator James Orengo. “The world knows who won the August polls with 80 per cent votes.” He was speaking in Kibra’s Kamukunji grounds in Nairobi yesterday, accompanied by other NASA legislators. “This time we are totally prepared and we will not be intimidated by a fake government. We know the Constitution and in the next two weeks we will tell Kenyans the way forward,” Orengo said. The team said Raila will head to the United States to explain to the top leadership how individual families have manipulated the electoral process to stay in power for 50 years since Independence.  “America has already started arresting people who stole elections, and in Kenya, the government plans to reward them with plum jobs. We will not allow it,” said former Kakamega Senator Bonny Khalwale. He urged the people who have used their proximity to power to stop bragging about how wealthy they are after stealing taxpayers’ funds.
