A witness in the election petition against Kisumu Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o on Tuesday told the court he had accessed the IEBC servers. Levy Otieno said he had accessed the servers through an employee of the IEBC. Otieno, who said he works at Safaricom as an IT engineer, said a contact person at the commission gave him passwords to access their servers, which he claimed were also accessed by individuals associated with Nyong’o. Judge David Majanja asked Otieno to write down in confidence the name of his contact at the IEBC, which he gave to the court.  Otieno was testifying in support of the petition filed by former Governor Jack Ranguma’s against the IEBC and Nyong’o. Ranguma wants the court to overturn Nyong’o’s victory.   In his affidavit, he said several electoral malpractices were committed during the voting and transmission of the results.
