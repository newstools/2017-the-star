It’s heart-wrenching to see three-year-old Rachel Muthoni crawl, crying in pain because her feet are infested by jiggers. The orphan cannot walk. The girl lives in Mahuria village in Kandara, Murang’a county. Her grandmother, Rachael Muthoni, who also has jiggers, says her grandaughter cannot sleep because of the pain. The girl’s mother, Catherine Njoki, died in April, leaving her, her three sisters and brother under the care of her ageing grandmother.  The family depends on well-wishers, including neighbours, for food and clothing. Muthoni told the Star on Wednesday her granddaughter sleeps for less than 10 minutes a day because of the pain caused by jiggers that have especially affected her feet, hands and knees. “She is always in tears, scratching her entire body. I have tried to find a solution to this menace to no avail because I, too, am stricken. Only God can rescue us,” she sobbed. Muthoni said life has not been good to her grandchild and pleads for help.  “I cry out to leaders to help us,” she said. The Red Cross fumigated the house.  Donations can be sent through Muthoni’s neighbour, Lucy, who can be reached on 0713578172.
