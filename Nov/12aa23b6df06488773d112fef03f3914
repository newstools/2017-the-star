Twenty-seven witnesses will testify in a case challenging the election of Mike Sonko as Nairobi governor, a court was told. Sonko will call two witnesses to defend his win while the IEBC will call 23. The other two will be called by petitioners Japheth Muroko and Zachaeus Okoth. The court is yet to decide whether former Governor Evans Kidero will be enjoined in the petition. High Court judge Msagha Mbogholi yesterday directed that the application be heard on November 13. The main petition will be heard on November 28, 29 and 30. Hearing will resume on December 4. Kidero wants to be enjoined in the case, saying he has evidence to prove that more than 60 per cent of Forms 37A used to declare Sonko the winner, contained irregularities. Kidero said some of the forms had multiple anomalies, others had no polling station tallies while others lacked security features. He said 798 of the 1,300 Forms 37A used to declare Sonko's victory, were not signed by the agents and presiding officers. Sonko has opposed Kidero's application. He said Kidero's claims cannot be supported by any evidence. He said he fairly won the August 8 election. He said the election was conducted in accordance with the law and that no agents were barred from polling stations. He maintains that he was elected in a free, fair and transparent process that was also conducted in accordance with the Constitution and Election laws. The governor also questions Kidero’s sources of electoral data, saying he has quoted figures that were not contained in the forms. Sonko has also dismissed claims that agents from other parties were barred from polling stations. Sonko has also denied colluding with presiding officers to do any unlawful acts with a view to manipulating or tampering with the election, voters, voting or transmission of results. Yesterday parties also agreed to hear an applications on November 23 that seeks orders to access Kiems kits and access of ballot papers.
