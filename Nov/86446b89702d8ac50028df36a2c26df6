Mombasa county will have a bigger working population by 2028 if the current efforts to improve education and health are maintained, NCPD Coast coordinator Margaret Mwaila has said. The National Council for Population and Development projects that Mombasa is likely to achieve a demographic dividend in 2028, when unemployment rate will be low. A demographic dividend is a moment of high economic development occasioned by low births, low deaths and low dependency. Mwaila on Friday said in 2028, the working age population will be bigger than the dependent population. “We expect that fertility rate will have gone down and deaths will also be low,” she said. She spoke during the African Statistics Day celebrations at PCEA Wogect Centre in Mombasa. Dependent population includes young people between 0-14 years and old people above 64 years. The working age population includes those aged between 15-64 years. Currently, Mombasa’s estimated population is slightly more than 1.2 million people. The 2009 census placed the population at 939,000. Of these, about 572,800 fall under the working age population. In April last year, the Mombasa government launched the Sh33 billion Mombasa County Vision 2035. The blueprint is meant to boost infrastructure, industry and investment and transform the county into a regional commercial hub. In October this year, Governor Hassan Joho created a Vision 2035 portfolio, which will be manned by Deputy Governor William Kingi. The new post, Joho said, is to accelerate development in the coastal town.
