Two Nairobi county officials have been sent on compulsory leave over the hawkers menace. Albert Kipkoech and Chrispine Caleb were allegedly under instruction to sabotage Governor Mike Sonko's  government. Acting county secretary Leboo ole Morintat said in a letter that the two allowed hawkers to block shops in the central business district. This was while Caleb was acting operations director and Kipkoech the acting deputy. "You are hereby instructed to proceed on compulsory leave with immediate effect and not later than November 2 until you are recalled," the letter read. Morintat asked Peter Mbaya, the senior inspector at City Hall, to take over from Kipkoech. "You will monitor and plan operations in the 17 sub-counties, prepare the department's operations and enforce laws within all the sub-counties," he said. Mbaya will also discipline workers and attend meetings on departmental operations. Nairobi residents have complained as hawkers take over most pavements to sell their wares throughout the week. Residents and business owners say this interferes with operations and want Sonko to find a solution. During his swearing-in, the Governor issued a proposal to reorganise hawkers in the town centre. The plan involves identification, digital registration and licensing before allocation of space, and will be complete by December.
