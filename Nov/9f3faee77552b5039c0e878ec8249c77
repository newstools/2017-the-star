Celebrations for President Uhuru Kenyatta’s repeat election victory on Monday turned into a looting spree at Nyambare trading centre in Lari, Kiambu. This went on into the night. Youths noticed that motorists responding to their “victory greetings” had expensive mobile phones, wristwatches, necklaces and other valuables. They closed in for the kill and started robbing. At first, several calls for police help were unsuccessful. Police on patrol eventually arrived at the scene and saw ‘celebrants’ stopping vehicles and looting property.  Their efforts to contain the situation resulted in chaos and running battles. Residents seek help Some residents, disturbed by what was taking place, called police stations to seek help. They said they heard gunshots and feared the worst. “We called the police at around 1am, since we would still hear gunshots. They told us they wanted to clear the highway because some youths had taken advantage of the celebrations and started robbing motorists,” resident Ayub Waweru said. “We heard the shots for almost two hours.”  Get away with luggage Police boss Isaiah Odhiambo yesterday said some goons hung onto buses as others opened boots to get away with luggage. “Our efforts to disperse them in the dark by shouting and talking to them were futile. It was like we were playing hide-and-seek games,” he said. “We were forced to use tear gas from 11pm, when some of those celebrating had left for their homes. Those remaining behind burnt tyres, but no more songs were being sung.” Trailed to villages Odhiambo said they trailed the thugs to Ngarariga, Murengeti, Gitithia, Githirioni, Gitithia and Escarpment villages. “We pushed them and they went to those villages,” he said. “Meantime, we had to escort motorists to ensure the safety of night travellers.” Similar scenes were witnessed at Kwambira in Limuru, Kiambu, but police acted swiftly and shot in the air to scare away looters. The officers cleared the road and restored order.
