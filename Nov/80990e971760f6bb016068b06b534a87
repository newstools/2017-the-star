Almost a month to Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko’s 100 days in office, the garbage menace is still a challenge. This is despite his Ng’arisha Jiji initiative, which started a few days after he won the governor seat. During his inauguration in August, Sonko said his administration will embark on cleaning the mess left by the previous county government. He will mark 100 days in office on November 29. The cleanup was conducted within the CBD, City Park, the Mukuru Kwa Reuben slum and extended to Kamukunji, Dagoretti North, Westlands and Makadara. Kariokor, Burma, Kangemi and Wakulima markets were also cleaned up. However, the garbage menace is still a problem. Several dumpsites have been erected along ongoing road projects such as the Outer Ring Road construction.
