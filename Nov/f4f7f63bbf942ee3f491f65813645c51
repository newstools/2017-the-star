Police yesterday intensified patrols in Kawangware following violence that broke out in the area on Sunday evening. Tension remained high in Congo slums and Kawangware 56 as youth engaged police officers in running battles. They threw stones and barricaded roads.  Anti-riot police fired tear gas to disperse them, only for the youths to reemerge whenever the officers retreated. The officers were unable to use water canon as the lorry could not penetrate the slums.  A police helicopter hovered over the area and police intensified surveillance. Chaos broke out in the area on Sunday evening with youths barricading Salim Road.  A resident told the Star that they were protesting the killing of five people in Baba Dogo on Sunday morning. “They attacked and killed our people in Baba Dogo and we heard that they were coming for us. So we are protecting ourselves,” Samson Nyongesa said. Police arrived in  the area at about 8pm Sunday. “They started beating people and hurling tear gas even in houses. That forced everybody to came out and protest,” said Richard Melunga.   Last month, there were deadly clashes in the area pitting Jubilee and NASA supporters.
