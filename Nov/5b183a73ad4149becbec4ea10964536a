Machakos MCAs have been accused of sabotaging Governor Alfred Mutua after he rejected their demands for Sh1.3 billion from the 2017- 2018 budget. An county official, who sought anonymity for fear of victimisation, said the assembly vowed to sabotage the executive until their budget demands are met. “They said they will shoot down anything brought to the assembly by the governor, including bills,” the source told the Star on Saturday. Documents seen by the Star dated November 13 and November 16 show correspondence between the county government and the county assembly asking for large amounts of money without stating the programmes the cash is meant for. The county government refused to give MCAS money, citing lack of proper accounting. The executive said the assembly was wasting public funds, saying it is better to spend it on development. “MCAs want to spend the money without a budget or an agenda. This creates room for looting,” the source said. “The total budget for the 2017-2018 financial year is Sh9,990,184,543. Out of this, Sh8,290,184,543 is to be funded through equitable share from the National Treasury transfers while Sh1,700,000,000 is to be funded using the county’s revenue,” reads part of the document from the Machakos government’s county treasury. “Judging from the reported revenue collection for the last two financial years, which has been approximately Sh1.2 billion for the 2015-2016 financial year and Sh1.3 billion for 2016-2017 financial year, it is highly unlikely that the projected Sh1.7 billion will be met,” the correspondence reads. “In order not to spend money that we do not have, it is advisable to cut the total budget by Sh400 million,” the document adds. In other correspondence, a county executive says, “As you are aware, county funds are public resources, which must be spent strictly in accordance with the principles of Public Finance under Article 201 of the Constitution.” “We have noted that your requisition is not based on itemised and programme-based budget needs, but on a division of the total budgeted amount with the number of months,” the executive says. “Ordinarily, it would be expected that some months will have higher needs than others, hence itemised requisitions based on actual requirements per month.” The assembly recently rejected all the five executive’s nominated by Mutua.
