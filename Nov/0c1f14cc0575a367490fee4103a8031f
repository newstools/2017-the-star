Former Mombasa Senator Hassan Omar's mother Mama Aisha Mazrui has died. Mama Aisha passed away over the weekend and will be buried on Monday 4pm at the Fort Jesus site. President Uhuru Kenyatta mourned her as a woman who lived a life of single-minded service to her family, community and the nation. "Bi Aisha was an extremely kind and generous woman, known to many in Old Town as Khalati Eisha. "On behalf of my family, I extend our sincere and heartfelt condolences to Mama Aisha’s family, relatives and friends. We will continue to stand with you in this hour of grief." Omar lost his governor bid on a Wiper ticket to ODM's Hassan Joho after serving one term as senator.
