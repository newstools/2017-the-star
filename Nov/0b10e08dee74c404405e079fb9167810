Engongu Empakasi Kaputiei Trust on Sunday emerged as claimants of 1, 580 acres veterinary land after another group in August claimed it. The battle over the prime land in Ngong had been dragged into State House by former Kajiado West MP Moses Sakuda (pictured), representing the Keek-Onyokie Maasai and Kajiado North MP, Joseph Manje, serving the interest of Engonku Empakasi Kaputiei Trust. In August, the Keek-Onyokie Maasai petitioned President Uhuru Kenyatta to fast-track the handing over of the land to the Kajiado West community. They claimed the land had been given for research to the British government by a Keek-Onyokie chief. On Sunday, three elders representing Engonku Empakasi claimed the Keek-Onyokie Maasai team is an “imposter”. The three confirmed that the National Assembly received petitions from Keek-Onyokie Olmorogi Trust led by their officials. “The land in question is in Kajiado North and not Kajiado West as was claimed,” said Engonku Empakasi Kaputiei Trust Committee treasurer Solomon Sironka. Committee secretary Jacob Wangora said over the years, the land at the veterinary has changed the purpose from original intended use and has to date not benefitted the natives or inhabitants.
