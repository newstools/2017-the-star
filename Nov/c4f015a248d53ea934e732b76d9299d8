Nyaribari Chache MP Richard Tong’i on Friday asked a court hearing a case challenging his election to expunge affidavits and annexures by a petitioner. Through lawyer Okong’o Omogeni, Tongi said first petitioner Chris Bichage used different names in the two documents.  “The petitioner is a stranger because names appearing on the sworn affidavit and those in the annextures are different,” Omogeni told Justice Anthony Ndung’u. Ndung’u will rule on the application on November 28.
