An attempt to unblock a sewer line in Garissa town yesterday turned tragic when two workers slipped into the manhole and drowned. The two staff of the Garissa Water and Sewerage Company were among a team working on a 15m sewage line near Equity Bank blocked by garbage.  County police commander David Kirina said the accident happened at 11am. “One worker had managed to unblock the sewer line but while climbing a ladder on his way out, he was swept away by sewer water,” he said. “His colleague tried to pull him out but was overpowered, and both drowned in the manhole.” The victims hail from the neighbouring Mwingi subcounty, Kitui county. Water executive Issa Dubow said the deaths were “regrettable and unfortunate”. He said the water company will foot all funeral expenses of the deceased. Kirina agreed that the incident was “unfortunate”.  The police boss urged Gawasco workers to take greater precautions while dealing with blockages. “Some of these sewer lines have not been unblocked for a long time. The workers should be extra careful when working in these deep sewer lines,” Kirina said. The incident brought business around the scene to a virtual standstill, as hundreds of residents converged to have a glimpse of the search-and-rescue mission. It took more than three hours for the public, the Kenya Red Cross and the Garissa fire brigade to retrieve the bodies. The incident brought to fore preparedness of the county disaster management department to respond and deal with tragedies of such magnitude. The bodies of the middle-aged men were taken to the Garissa Referral Hospital mortuary for postmortem and preservation.
