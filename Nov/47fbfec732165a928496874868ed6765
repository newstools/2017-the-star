Dairy farmers in Homa Bay will get a Sh27 million milk-cooling plant to be built in Oyugis. USaid and the International Livestock Research Institute agreed to set up the 10,000-litre a milk cooling plant to cut losses from glut that cannot be refrigerated and sold later. The project is called the Kasbondo Dairy Cooperative. USaid programme director Romano Kiome said the milk cooler will improve food security by ensuring quality preservation and milk processing of milk.  After the groundbreaking on Tuesday, Kiome called for cooperation between the county and the dairy farmers.   The Kasbondo Dairy Cooperative chairman Joseph Ojwang said the plant will help their 462 members to double- production.
