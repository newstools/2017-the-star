Traders from centres in Budalang’i constituency, Busia, have threatened to stop paying revenue to the county government unless heaps of uncollected garbage are collected. Speaking to the Star on Thursday, the traders, led by their chairman Fredrick Opiyo, accused the National Environment Management Authority department in the area of failing to take steps to ensure garbage is collected. The traders urged the Public Health department to visit the trading centre and assess the situation and issue a closure notice to avoid a cholera outbreak. The market chairman said the last time a garbage collection truck was seen at the busy trading centre adjacent to Bunyala subcounty headquarters was in April.
