Former Nairobi speaker Alex ole Magelo has urged the Maasai to unite and shun divisive leaders. Some politicians have been attempting to incite the community against others since the Supreme Court upheld President Uhuru Kenyatta’s reelection last Monday. “We are warriors, but our bravery and prowess are meaningless if we don’t protect our homes,” he said. “This means standing up against anyone inciting violence or retaliation against our people, people living within our community or our neighbours,” he added. In a statement yesterday, Magelo asked the community to be law abiding and accept the ruling of the apex court. “We will not tolerate divisive rhetoric because it is time for reconciliation, healing and moving forward,” he added. He pleaded with leaders from the community, irrespective of their political affiliations, to accept the court’s decision.
