Jacaranda Grounds where former Prime Minister Raila Odinga was planning to hold a prayer rally on Tuesday was inaccessible after tankers poured raw sewage there. Two tankers are said to have been sighted at the grounds at the wee hours on Tuesday and are believed to have dumped the waste. NASA supporters, who were called to a rally by Raila to mourn supporters shot dead by police, could also not access the area as anti-riot police ringed the grounds. City Mortuary, where the bodies of the killed victims are kept was also under key and lock. There were suspicions that NASA leaders wanted to carry the remains of the killed supporters to a Jacaranda Grounds for the prayer rally. These are some of the trick employed by the government to ground Raila and his team, who had threatened to hold a parallel swearing in ceremony. Threats by NASA to hold a parallel swearing in ceremony has been a headache to the government. Officers from elite police units and the NIS were deployed to trail key opposition leaders and report their movements during the state function.
