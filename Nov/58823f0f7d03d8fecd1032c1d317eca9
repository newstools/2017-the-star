Kenya Sevens team have had a change of heart and will now attend the Safland Sevens this weekend in Namibia following pressure from the Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) board. Only last week, the technical bench said it will not grace the tournament, owing to inferior of quality of teams taking part. The Kenyan squad were set to go to the next monthâ€™s World Sevens Series in Dubai without a build-up tournament under their belt unlike the rest of the core teams who have graced several pre-season events across the globe. The team missed out on participation on the Assupol Sevens in Stellenbosch, South Africa late last month after failing to get the visa in good time for the tournament. Kenya reached the final last year in Safland, losing to South Africa 31-10. Menengai Oilers duo of Eric Ombasa and Sam Muregi have been called up to the squad that will travel for the two-day tournament. They join a seasoned group of travellers who include Sammy Oliech, Oscar Ayodi, Eden Agero and Frank Wanyama as the Kenya Sevens set up seeks to try out combinations and test new and returning players ahead of the upcoming campaign, which kickoffs in Dubai on December 1-2. Teams expected for Safland include Lesotho, Uganda Mauritius, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Czech Republic will make their debut in the tournament, following in the footsteps of Germany and Poland, who participated in previous tournaments. The team departs today morning.
