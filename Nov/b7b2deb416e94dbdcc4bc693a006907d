President Uhuru Kenyatta and opposition leader Raila Odinga have been asked to use Bishop Cornelius Korir’s funeral tomorrow to unify the nation. Leaders and clerics from the Rift Valley said the only honour the duo can give the late clergyman is to bury their political differences and agree to work together for the sake of peace and harmony. Speaking during a mass in honour of Korir at Segutiet Parish in Bomet on Wednesday, Kanu secretary general Nick Salat said it was Korir’s wish that the duo come together regardless of their political differences and unite Kenyans. He said, “Korir died while on a mission of ensuring the current stalemate in the country, which has brought about deaths, comes to an end and the only gift our leaders can give him during his sendoff is for them to shake hands and proclaim peace.” Salat said the country has lost a great leader, adding his mission should be carried on. Retired General John Koech said the power tussle is unnecessary. He said hard line positions will solve nothing.
