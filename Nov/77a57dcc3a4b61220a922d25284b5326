Safaricom has denied rumours on the appointment of Yolanda Zoleka as its new chief executive officer replacing Bob Collymore. This follows information doing the rounds on social media yesterday that Collymore has been replaced by Zuleka. Zoleka, a citizen of South Africa, is currently the chief executive of Vodafone Ghana. According to information from Vodafone Ghana website, she joined Vodacom Group in November 2014 as strategy and new business director. She previously worked as executive director, strategy & business support at South African Breweries Limited and as group chief executive of the publicly-listed Mvelaphanda Group. Zoleka joined Vodafone Ghana in March 2016 following the exit of Haris Broumidis, who took up a new appointment as chief executive of Vodafone Greece. “I have also seen the rumour doing rounds on social media; ignore it, that’s fake news,” one of the telco’s senior staff told the Star. Collymore has been on medical leave since mid-October, raising speculation of change of management at the company. His absence saw the current chief financial officer Sateesh Kamath and the director of strategy and innovation Joseph Ogutu taking up the responsibility of leading the firm. According to a press statement sent to newsrooms last month, Kamath is expected to take a primary role in running Safaricom while Ogutu will be responsible for the firm’s day-to-day operations until Collymore returns. The firm has however not indicated when the CEO will be coming back.
