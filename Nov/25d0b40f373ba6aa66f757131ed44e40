The national
alliance of registered churches yesterday urged President Uhuru
Kenyatta to use governors close to the electorate in reconciling the
country. Speaking to The Star on phone on Wednesday, Chairman Bishop Samuel Welimo said President Uhuru
should  begin to reach out to the forty
seven governors from both Jubilee and nasa camps immediately after being sworn in office. Welimo said
that there has been a long political standoff that has ignited hatred among Kenyans hence the need for something urgent being done. Welimo called upon the President to reach out to the opposition leaders and agree on possible way forward for the sake of peace and economic stability.  ‘As a church
we want to congratulate Uhuru for his victory and humbly ask him to ensure that
the greatest task ahead  of putting the country together is done immediately
for the sake of moving forward as a country,’ Welimo said. Welimo said
that the Supreme Court ruling gave the country direction and its high time
leaders stopped their political differences and forge ahead with developments
and serving the people. He said that
governors should work together with the President for the sake of development. ‘I hereby
advice the President to reach out to every county when making appointments of state officers for the sake of reconciliation and healing of the
nation,’ Welimo added. He asked civil societies and human rights activists not to take sides or remain neutral
in political matters in the country so as not to trigger emotions from supporters
from various camps.
