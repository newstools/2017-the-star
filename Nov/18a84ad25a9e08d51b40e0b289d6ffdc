Some of the arrears accrued are utility bills such as rent and electricity. Some contractors and county service providers staged protests while others decided to engage former governor Nathif Jama directly. The assumption of office committee chaired by County Secretary Mohamud Mursal requested the governor to set up an independent board to look at the assets, liabilities and human resource in the county. The assumption of the office of the governor committee was established on July 7 this year and is funded by the state through the Cabinet Secretary for Devolution and Planning. The committee is mandated with organizing security for both the governor and their deputy, coordinate  the swearing in ceremony, brief the governor-elect on the committee progress, receive departmental reports as well as compile and submit  the report to the governor.
