All well-meaning county assemblies will dismiss the NASA motions seeking the creation of People’s Assemblies, Nyandarua speaker Wahome Ndegwa has said. “And I am waiting for it so that I feel the pleasure of dismissing it so that the Constitution can prevail,” he said on Friday. Ndegwa said he would like to see the motion to know under what sections or articles of the Constitution it is founded. He said the Constitution is clear and recognises only two assemblies - Parliament and the county assemblies.To create other assemblies outside the parameters of the Constitution,he said, is “criminal and illegal,and is an attempt by the opposition to be relevant”. Ndegwa said, “We are not going to allow NASA to create trouble so that they can create a platform for dialogue.”
