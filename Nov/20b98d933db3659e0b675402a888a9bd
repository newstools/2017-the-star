Kwale residents yesterday went on with their daily activities despite the inauguration of President Uhuru Kenyatta. Residents remained calm in their places of work even as other Kenyans celebrated Uhuru's swearing in for a second term. Although business was slow, most people kept away from Television sets. In Msambweni for instance, nobody was seen listening to the swearing in ceremony over the radio is is often the case with big occasions. Those interviewed by the Star said they had nothing to celebrate since they did not vote for Uhuru. They said they were disappointed with the Supreme Court decision that upheld Uhuru's win "Its unfortunate that only a fraction of the people are celebrating. We don't recognise Uhuru's victory," Kombani resident Said Malipo said. Yesterday had been declared a public holiday. But only government offices in the county remained closed. Hotels and eateries conducted usual business with customers flowing in and out as usual. Uhuru garnered 31,000 votes from the county during the October 26 repeat presidential election. Governor Salim Mvurya was away in Nairobi to attend the swearing in ceremony. "The Governor has joined other Jubilee leaders in the ceremony. He was accompanied by other county staff," county director of information Daniel Nyassy said.Â
