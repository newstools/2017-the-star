Kenya Motor Sports Club Rally, the eighth round of the Kenya National Rally Championship has beemn cancelled due to bad weather. The event initially slated for Konza and Lisa Farm was cancelled due to impassable roads occasioned by ongoing torrential downpour.  In a bulletin, KMSC Rally clerk of the course, Jim Kahumbura said it was impossible to run the event with the growing wet situation. He said the black cotton soil was bound to make it impossible hence the decision to cancel the event.  “In the last 4 days, the Konza area where the above-named event was scheduled to run has been inundated with rains and an average rainfall of between 25mm and 35mm has been recorded. Unfortunately, this has led to the roads on the two farms where the event was to run impassable. Clerk of course in consultation with the event stewards has cancelled the event on account of safety and impassable roads. The organising club will liaise with KMSF to find an alternative date to run the event and ensure this round of the championship counts in 2017. Clerk of course regrets any inconvenience caused,” said Jim Kahumbura. This year’s KNRC has seen organisers call off three rallies, citing logistical quagmire.  Nanyuki was postponed on safety grounds due to farm invasions by squatters while Nakuru Rally was pushed to December as it coincided with the national general elections of August 8. Manvir Baryan, who has already sealed the African Rally Championship with Zambia victory won the season opener in North Coast. His MRT teammate Tapio Laukannen emerged the winner on ARC Safari Rally while Baryan was back in the groove with Fly 540 RSC Rally. Carl Tundo won Eldoret Rally with defending champion Tapio suffering two DNFs in Mombasa and Eldoret. Tapio is lying 6th. Ian Duncan leads the overall standings of the KNRC despite having not won any event.
