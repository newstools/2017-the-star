A Kenyan has been arrested in the US for allegedly assaulting his landlady who attempted to evict him. Samuel Nyaboga reportedly refused to pay rent for an apartment at Brooklyn Park, forcing the landlady to start the eviction process last week, a witness told police. Reports indicated Nyaboga hit the woman with an axe multiple times after she demanded payment. She ran out of the building but the 45-year-old pursued her and allegedly threatened to kill a witness. According to the Star Tribune, Nyaboga struck the woman on the head and left her for dead. Police arrived minutes later and found the woman lying in a pool of blood. Reports indicated she was rushed to hospital and found to have a skull fracture. Nyaboga was remanded at Hennepin County jail.
