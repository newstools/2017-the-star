Hawkers in Nairobi's CBD will be relocated in the next few weeks following public outcry. Governor Mike Sonko has started talks with their leaders and will meet them on November 13 to discuss their move to Ngara area. Sonko is heard saying in a recording that he has found space for the small business people and that they will move after their meeting with him at City Hall next week. "We will settle all your people there so please call them for a meeting and brief them on this development," he tells Nairobi Hawkers Association chairman Waweru Kimani. "We do not need to fight to make Nairobi a better place." Kimani told The Star by phone that Governor reached out to them and asked them to form committees to ensure smooth transition. "We already did that...we will soon leave but for now it is business as usual," he said. The Governor does not want hawkers in the city centre and has ordered continued operations by police and county askaris. "There will be operations starting today (Friday) and there will be no bailing them out to ensure businesses are not closed," he says. "I helped you when you had problems so make plans and help me work well with all Nairobians," he tells the traders. City askaris have been blamed for the menace and accused of acting unprofessionally.  This led to the suspension of acting operations director Crispine Caleb and his assistant Albert Kipkoech. Acting county secretary Leboo ole Morintat said in a letter that the two allowed hawkers to block shops in the central business district. "You are hereby instructed to proceed on compulsory leave with immediate effect until you are recalled to office,' read the letter sent on Thursday. The two were the direct bosses of the seven askaris who were arrested over the weekend and charged with stealing from some traders.
