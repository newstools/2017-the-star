Governors and nurses have begun discussions to finish up the caregivers’ Collective Bargaining Agreement ahead of the one-month deadline. A return-to-work agreement signed by the two parties two weeks ago requires that the CBA be ready by December 2 — 30 days after the signing. A statement from the Council of Governors yesterday said representatives from both sides spent the whole day deliberating on the new CBA. “This is part of the return-to-work formula reached by the parties that ended the strike,” the statement signed by CoG chairman Josphat Nanok said. The nurses were represented by Kenya National Union of Nurses deputy secretary general Maurice Opetu and vice-chairman Joseph Ngwassi, while CoG was represented by the county public service boards. Nurses had been on strike for more than 100 days when the agreement was reached. They went on strike on June 5. Nanok said the strike began before talks on a new CBA were concluded. “It is notable that the nurses went on strike while the negotiations on their CBA were taking place. This was an act of bad faith,” Nanok said. According to the return-to-work formula, nurses would initially earn an extra cumulative allowance of Sh3,416 every month, beginning June next year. The nurses were also promised that their existing Sh10,000 annual uniform allowance will be increased by Sh5,000 every year from next year until 2020. Sh3,000 will also be added to their existing monthly nursing service allowance next year. The agreement was signed by KNUN secretary general Seth Panyako and Ngwasi.
