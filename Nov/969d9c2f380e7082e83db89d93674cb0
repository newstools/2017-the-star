Giving poor ratings after an Uber ride might no longer count, hence will not impact the drivers overall rating, new Uber policy shows. According to the new policy officially released yesterday, low ratings, hampered by reasons beyond a driver-partners control, will not count towards a driver's score. “Sometimes riders might give their trip a low rating for reasons beyond a driver -partner’s control like an issue with the Uber App. With the new ratings policy, Uber will still get the feedback to help them improve but it won’t impact the driver’s overall rating,” the policy noted. Other outstanding features in the policy include a per-minute fee for the driver whenever a rider keeps them waiting more than five minutes after the driver-partners arrive at their pick-up location. With arrival times just a few minutes, customers are encouraged to only request a ride when it’s time to leave. “Drivers have been very clear on what they need and based on their responses, we will be rolling out products that can address three keys areas: more flexibility for drivers when it comes to when they want to use Uber, using our technology to create a stress-free experience, and building on safety,” Uber East Africa general manager Loic Amado said. Uber has also introduced a long-trip notification which will see information sent to driver-partners to fit driving around their lifestyle, which means drivers will now get a heads-up when a trip is estimated to be 45 minutes or longer, so they can plan accordingly. On arrival and destinations, drivers will be able to set the time they want to arrive at their final destination at any time of the day with the arrival time feature. As drivers go about their day with the destination and arrival time set, the app will notify them when it's time to start heading toward their destination. At that time, they'll be connected with a trip.
