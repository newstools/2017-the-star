NASA has advised its supporters to remain calm even if they are provoked by their opponents. “We urge you to be still, focused and wait for the way forward from the NASA leadership,” director of communication Philip Etale said in a tweet. The country has been politically polarised after the August 8 General Election. The tweet was posted soon after the Supreme Court threw out a petition against President Uhuru Kenyatta’s win in the October 26 presidential rerun. Former Kilome MP Harun Mwau’s petition was thrown out.  In another tweet, Suna East MP Junet Mohamed said, “After thorough discussions, I managed to convince our supporters that we do not need guns. We shall remain peaceful Kenyans and God shall protect us.” Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen urged those opposed to Uhuru’s win to accept the decision of the court and join others in rebuilding the economy. Thirdway Alliance leader Ekuru Aukot said after the Supreme Court verdict, Kenya can now move forward. He said the party will put the government in check. Kajiado Governor Joseph ole Lenku said the ruling is a win for the whole country. What is left is for the President to unite the country. “Kenya requires serious healing. The head of state can unite our polarised state. We need each other at all times and bad politics can only damage this country,” Lenku said.
