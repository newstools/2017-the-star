Embu county majority leader Michael Njeru has said the assembly will reject a bill seeking secession of 40 of the countryâ€™s 47 counties.  Njeru said if the bill, drafted by Homa Bay MP Peter Kaluma is presented to the assembly after collection of 1 million signatures, they will reject it.  He said Opposition chief Raila Odinga withdrew on his own volition from the repeat October 26 presidential poll. He said the election was transparent, verifiable and accountable. Njeru spoke to the Star from Nairobi. He said Kenya is a unitary state where all the over 44 tribes co-exist peacefully and who should not be divided just to serve the interests of the opposition.
