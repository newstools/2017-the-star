Anti riot police in Kericho yesterday morning fired tear gas to disperse rioting matatu operators after two of their vehicles were stoned by unknown persons at Awasi trading centre in Kisumu county. Unruly youths smashed the windscreens of the Wareng Sacco matatus as they ferried passengers from Kericho to Edoret towns. Some passengers were slightly injured. Kericho base commander Michael Kahare and station boss Abduraham Mohamed said they had a hard time clearing the busy Kericho-Kisumu highway near Ndege Chai Plaza. Kericho town youths barricaded the road In protest. At some point, the youths threatened to flush out members of a “certain community” from the town by midday yesterday if those in Awasi did not stop stoning their vehicles over political differences. Kericho police boss Justus Kitetu and Kericho East subcounty commissioner Stanislaus Apokwo arrived and talked to the rioters. Some matatus opted to use the Total-Molo-Londiani route for fear of attack.
