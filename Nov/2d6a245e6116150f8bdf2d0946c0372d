Kisumu and Nandi leaders want residents to co-exist peacefully and end perennial border skirmishes that have led to loss of lives and property. Agriculture CS Willy Bett, governors Anyang’ Nyong’o (Kisumu) and Stephen Sang (Nandi) on Thursday said the Luo, Nandi and Kipsigis should live in harmony without ethnic clashes. This will help them grow economically, they added. There have been border disputes brought about by cattle rustling, border disputes and political differences. Senators Fred Outa (Kisumu) and Samson Cherargei (Nandi), MPs Onyango (Koyoo), Julius Melly (Tinderet), Vincent Tuwei (Mosop) and Jared Okello (Nyando) also urged peace. Nyong’o said the communities must not fight, kill or maim each other. “We need each other for us to improve our living standards. Why should you fight one another if you can sit down and solve any arising problems,” he said. Nyong’o said the communities have lived in harmony and peace for years and should, therefore, not be divided along tribal or political lines. Sang said criminals must not be allowed to destroy “our cordial relationship”.
