Two people were killed and 31 others injured in two separate accidents on the Nairobi-Nakuru highway yesterday. In the first accident, two men died on the spot after the matatu they were travelling in collided head-on with a personal car near Mithuri, about two kilometres from Naivasha town. Sixteen passengers were injured and rushed to several hospitals in the lakeside town and its environs. Witness Peter Mwangi said the driver of the car tried to overtake a number of vehicles, when it collided with the matatu. “The driver was heading to Nairobi,” he said. A few minutes later, four vehicles, including a matatu, collided near the Karai blackspot, injuring close to 15 people.  “The vehicle had slowed down to give way to passing vehicles on the opposite side, when three other private vehicles heading in the same direction hit one another,” witness Jane Wambui said.
