Nyeri residents are optimistic that Deputy Governor
Mutahi Kahiga will do a good job when he becomes county chief.  Leaders and residents interviewed said Kahiga, a trade unionist, is equal to
the task. Kahiga takes over as governor following the demise of his boss Wahome Gakuru on Tuesday. Gakuru's car was involved in an accident at Kabati on the Nyeri-Murang'a highway on his way to Nairobi. He died at Thika Level 5 Hospital as medics prepared to airlift him to Nairobi. On Wednesday the county announced Kahiga would be sworn in at 2pm yesterday at the governor's office compound.  An hour later it released a statement saying the swearing-in had been postponed indefinitely.  “Due to unforeseen circumstances, the
swearing in of Mutahi Kahiga as the fourth governor of Nyeri has been postponed
until further notice. We shall advise you accordingly. We regret the
inconvenience,” Transport executive Muthu Kariuki on Facebook. The Constitution states that if a governor dies in office then the deputy governor would be sworn in for the reminder of the term.  Kahiga was the Knut Nyeri branch executive secretary for two terms.  He is outgoing, charismatic,
an eloquent public speaker, down-to-earth and a God-fearing man.
 Kahiga, who is in his late 50s, holds a Bachelor of Education degree from the University
of Nairobi. He was a teacher for 20 years and served as the headmaster of a
primary school in Nyeri. Gakuru's vision was to move the county from position 47 to one in development, accountability and transparency.
