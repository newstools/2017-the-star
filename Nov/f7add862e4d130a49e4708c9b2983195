Co-operative Bank Group, the country’s second largest lender by market share, yesterday reported a 9.52 per cent drop in net profit for three months ended September. The lender’s profit after tax dropped to Sh9.5 billion during the review period, compared to sh10.5 billion the same time last year. The bank attributed the performance to a tight operating environment in the wake of the interest rate cap coupled with the general economic slowdown during an election year. “The Co-operative Bank Group is alive to both the challenges presented by the operating environment, and also the wide opportunities offered by Kenya’s growing economy,” chief executive Gideon Muriuki said. Customer deposits grew by 12.1 per cent or Sh31.2 billion to Sh289 billion in the third quarter of 2017, compared to Sh257.8 billion during the same period last year. During the July-September period, loans and advances to customers rose by Sh32.4 billion, a 14.2 per cent increase to Sh259.4 billion, up from Sh227 billion last year. The lender’s total interest income dropped 7.7 per cent to Sh29.9 billion from Sh32.3 billion. This was largely driven by the 6.9 per cent drop in interest income from loans and advances, despite the 14.2 per cent increase in net loans and advances. Interest expense also declined by 8.5 per cent to Sh9.1 billion, from Sh9.9 billion recorded the same period last year. Total operating expenses increased marginally by 0.7 per cent to Sh17.25 billion. The group’s South Sudan operations, which have been facing headwinds over hyperinflation, occasioned by devaluation of the South Sudanese currency, reported a Sh30 million profit during the review period. Co-operative Bank of South Sudan is a unique joint venture partnership with the Government of South Sudan, where Co-op Bank controls the majority share of 51 per cent while the government controls the remaining 49 per cent. Muriuki said the group will continue to focus on digitisation of its operations.
