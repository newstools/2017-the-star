This is the incredible moment a mother giraffe manages to shake off a lion that pounced on her. Footage captured on November 27 in Maasai Mara, Kenya, shows the giraffe standing over her calf as a lion stalks past them. The lion continues past the family and the giraffe begins to whip her tail from side to side. The giraffe then turns to look at the predator and it begins to walk away, leaving the viewer to think it has changed its mind. But then the lion runs around to the back of the giraffe and launches itself on to the mother's hip. She successfully manages to kick it off and the mother and baby start to run away. Sadly the mother trips over her baby, forcing the calf to fall down. The lion then launches itself at the baby and the video ends. The footage was posted online by Newsflare user Paul On Safari.  He said: 'A male lion kills a giraffe calf as the mother tries helplessly to defend. Happened in Masai Mara Kenya.'
