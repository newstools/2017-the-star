Democratic Party chairman Esau Kioni has faulted five Mt Kenya governors’ plan to rehabilitate the old Nanyuki railway, saying it’s not viable. He said on Sunday reviving it was tried many years ago by former Transport Minister John Michuki. It didn’t succeed because “it wasn’t a viable project,” he told reporters in Othaya. The governors behind the proposal are Ndiritu Muriithi (Laikipia), Wahome Gakuru (Nyeri), Ferdinand Waititu (Kiambu), Mwangi Wairia (Murang’a) and Anne Waiguru (Kirinyaga). They say the plan will tap the economic potential of their counties and promote growth. Kioni said the governors should instead fight to open the Tetu-Aberdare–Naivasha road to spur trade and economic growth in Nyeri, Nyandarua, Laikipia and Nakuru. “This should be the priority the governors should initiate, though Nema will oppose it. Animals can pass under the road as they do in other national parks. If tarmacked and opened, it will only take 26km from Kiandongoro in Tetu to the other side of Naivasha,” Kioni said. He said the railway would be a white elephant. A better priority would be to dual the carriageway from the Thika Superhighway to Nyeri, Nanyuki, Meru and Isiolo, Kioni said. The counties launched an integrated plan that brings together Nairobi, Kiambu, Murang’a, Nyeri and Laikipia. They target to invest about Sh25 billion in growth projects. Each county will contribute Sh100 million to kick-start revival of key projects.
