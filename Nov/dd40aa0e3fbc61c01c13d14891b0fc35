Parent involvement can make a positive difference in a child’s academic performance so schools should create programmes where it is compulsory for a caregiver to participate in student learning, a psychologist has said. Congratulating this year’s KCPE students, Gladys Chania on Friday said most of those who performed well had supportive parents. “Many parents are busy, but those who do take the time to know how their children are fairing in school help their children perform better. Children of uninvolved parents sometimes fall through the cracks in schools,” Chania said in Kiambu. She said Education CS Fred Matiang’i has proved improved the sector and many children now have great aspirations. “Kenyans have seen what Dr Matiang’i has done in the education sector. The school guidelines, curriculum and policies have been streamlined and we all should support the good work done,” Chania said. She urged the Ministry of Education to find ways to compel parents to be involved in their children’s education and well-being. “It is a crime for one not to take their children to school. Parents should be compelled to be involved in their children’s education and failure to do so should be a crime,” Chania said.
