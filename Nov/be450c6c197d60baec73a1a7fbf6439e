The High Court in Murang’a has dismissed a petition against the election of Kandara MP Alice Wahome on legal technicalities. Justice Hatari Waweru said petitioner Jane Mwaura, a Kandara voter, did not serve the petition in accordance to the law. Mwaura accused the MP of committing numerous electoral offences before and during the election.  In the petition, Mwaura said the MP was found bribing people during the election and that three people were arrested at Ng’araria polling station. They were later released under unclear circumstances. The petitioner wanted the court to nullify the MP’s election and either order a recount of the votes or a repeat election. The third option was to declare Wahome’s rival Phillip Njuguna wa Ruth the winner. The MP garnered 48,925 votes against Njuguna’s 31,784. She also wanted the MP barred from participating in elections in the future. The MP, however, applied to have the petition struck out on grounds that she was not served directly or through an advertisement published in a national newspaper as required by law.
