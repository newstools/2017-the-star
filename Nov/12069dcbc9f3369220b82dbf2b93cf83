Three people were seriously injured when the trailer they were travelling in plunged about 15m from Nyamasaria flyover in Kisumu county, on Monday morning. The two men and woman were rescued by residents and rushed to Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral hospital. Mark Otieno, a witness, said the trailer's driver had been speeding and lost control as he tried to go round a corner at the flyover. The boda boda operator noted matters would have been worse had pupils been on the path. They use it to get to school, he said, but noted they are on holiday. Residents vandalised parts of the trailer and made away with the layers mash it was transporting. In May last year, two people died after a similar accident involving a truck transporting sugarcane. The driver and loader died in the ICU at Jaramogi hospital, while a school girl suffered minor injuries after debris from the truck fell on her.
