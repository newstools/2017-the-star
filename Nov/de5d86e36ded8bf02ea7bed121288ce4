Incumbent Kitutu Chache South MP Richard Onyonka is facing a tough re-election challenge against candidates from NASA affiliates and a youthful Jubilee hopeful.  In a fierce supremacy battle for a third consecutive term in Parliament, the former Foreign Affairs Assistant minister will have to surmount sibling rivalry in next Tuesday’s by-election.  The by-election was called by the IEBC after Jubilee’s candidate, Leonard Mwamba, died in a road accident at Nyakoe area on the Kisii-Kisumu road before the August 8 General Election.  Jubilee Party nominated Anthony Kibagendi to square it out with Onyonka. Onyonka was elected on the ODM ticket in 2013, but during the party primaries in the run up to August polls, he was trounced by Samuel Omwando, and claimed he was rigged out.  He decamped to Ford Kenya, which is affiliated to NASA. Onyonka is among NASA candidates – Omwando (ODM), Andrew Maubi (Wiper) and Justus Mochoge (ANC) who are seeking the seat.  Onyonka is, however, confident of attaining victory, saying he transparently utilised the CDF cash and has a good track record.  The by-election was derailed after the Supreme Court nullified the August presidential election and a fresh one was ordered on October 26.  PDP’s Jimmy Onkangi and Kanu’s Morara Nyarang’o are also seeking to unseat Onyonka.  Onyonka clinched the seat in 2007 on the PDP ticket.
