Nairobi residents have protested to the National Environmental Complains Committee over cows grazing in the city and its outskirts. Secretary John Chumo yesterday said residents have complained that the cows cause traffic snarl-ups. “We are currently investigating the owners of the cows and how they came to Nairobi. We are going to [engage] the Nairobi County [Government] and other related bodies to ensure that all these cows are removed from the city,” he told the Star. Chumo said the Urban and Planning Act, Livestock Act and the Traffic Act outlaw livestock keeping in cities.  The Livestock Act outlaws livestock keeping in cities to prevent the spread of zoonotic diseases such as the deadly anthrax, which is transmitted from animals to humans. The Traffic Act holds the owner of a cow responsible if it causes an accident.  According to a study released last week by the International Livestock Research Institute, urban livestock-keeping poses a significant threat to the environment and health of dwellers.  The study showed that many of the animals kept in zero-grazed systems are fed with market waste, swirl from restaurants, and/or grass cut on road sides. This increases movement of pathogens throughout the city.
