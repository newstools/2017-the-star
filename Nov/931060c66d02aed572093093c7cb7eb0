A man was last night burnt to death inside his house in Nairobi’s Utawala area. The victim was sleeping when the fire started. Several other neighbouring kiosks were razed down. The cause of the fire is still unknown. The body was moved to the mortuary as the probe gets underway. In August, a family of seven perished when fire engulfed their house at Toll village in Kiminini. A man, his wife and five children were burnt to death. Neighbour Jospa Nandasaba said they heard the children screaming. Smoke was billowing from their house. “Neighbours broke the door and found the wife bleeding on the floor. The children were under the bed and their father was in a separate room,” he said. One child died on the way to the hospital.
