Former Nairobi chief financial officer Jimmy Kiamba and three others accused of graft-related offence yesterday blamed the EACC for bringing wrongful charges. Kiamba is accused of office, together with Lilian Ndegwa, Regina Rotich and Stephen Osiro. This came after Tabu Luanga of EACC forensics and assets department completed his investigations. The accused persons are accused of siphoning more than Sh20 million within one year. According to investigations, the money was obtained from the county accounts at the Co-operative bank between January 1 and December 31, 2014. In their defence, they told the trial magistrate Kennedy Bidali there is no evidence that they are accomplices. Kiamba and Ndegwa said the signatures on the vouchers were appended purely as an administrative function.
