A teacher was killed during a barfight in Gilgil on Wednesday night. The parties were arguing over the just-concluded elections when the fight broke out. The primary school teacher was hit on the head with a blunt object and died on the way to hospital. The two had been drinking in the same bar and argued over the legality of the election. The suspect turned against the teacher and hit him on the head using a wooden rod. During the incident at the popular Kikopey trading centre, business was disrupted as the bleeding victim was rushed to hospital. Witness Jane Muthoni said the two had been drinking when the argument started. She said the argument degenerated into name calling before the suspect grabbed the wooden bar. “The trader attacked the teacher from behind hitting him on the head. He collapsed as other patrons went to his rescue,” Muthoni said. A senior officer from Gilgil said the suspect is in police custody. “The body has been taken to the area mortuary and the suspect will be charged with murder once investigations are over,” the officer said. In the same town, a boda boda operator has been missing for four days. Bernard Gitau ferried two passengers to Jaica Village and did not report back to his station. The incident raised fears that he could have been robbed and murdered. Two local operators have been killed in the last month and their motorcycles stolen by gangs. Operators’ chairman Stephen Ochuka said Gitau was last seen on Sunday evening ferrying two men. Ochuka said he has filed a report at Gilgil police station. “We shall conduct a major search for the missing operator but we are working in fear as already two of our colleagues have been killed,” he said.
