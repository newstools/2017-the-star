Lugari MP Ayub Savula has told former Budalang’i MP Ababu Namwamba to lobby for a CS position without invoking the Luhya community. Savula told Ababu to stop purporting to speak on behalf of the community. He said Ababu is embarrassing Luhyas. “He is engaged in childish activism to please his Jubilee masters so that he is rewarded with a Cabinet position,” Savula told the Star on the phone yesterday. He said Ababu lost the people’s mandate when was voted out as Budalang’i MP. Ababu is currently the chairman of the Council of Professionals of Kenya. Savula said the council is an amorphous outfit for political rejects begging for appointments from Jubilee.  He said Ababu’s recent call for the delisting of NASA as a political alliance only widens divisions in the country. Ababu told the Registrar of Political Parties to deregister NASA because it has transformed into a resistance movement.
