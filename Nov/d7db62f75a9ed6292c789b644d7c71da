Crème De La Crème is one the best deejays in town, and he has come out to reveal that he once hated Naiboi's songs back in the day when he used to call himself Rapdamu. "Let me tell you, I hated this guy Naiboi. In fact, I hated his songs. I was like, who is Rapdamu? What is Rapdamu? Anarap nini?I had problems with his music. Honestly, I wasn't picking his calls, its about eight to ten years," he told Word Is. Years later, the two have now collaborated on a new song, I Wanna Be. Naiboi explained his change of heart. "He sent me a beat and I told him to delete the beat from his computer. I travelled and came back and our song was born. I did that so that he couldn't show it to anyone. I loved the beat. We recorded it at 2am." Crème said he appreciates the work Kenyan artistes are putting into their songs now that he's gotten the experience.  "I
never used to know that artistes have been putting a lot of hard work
on their songs. Now, I appreciate because I have an experience of what
they go through." Naiboi added: "I appreciate that Crème
has started having the heat of what we go through, most DJs don't
appreciate us, they're so judgmental. Once a DJ releases a song and
other DJs are not playing it, they'll understand what I go through. I'm
praying for all Kenyan DJs to be artistes, then wasukumiane kwa hao DJs
wengine waone kama waacheza." The two went ahead to tell radio presenters and DJs to stop subjecting songs to the 'hit or miss' poll. "There are so many DJs coming out and
they are so talented. I feel the love out here and I think they will
take this nation to the promised land," Naiboi said. "Radio presenters should not
ask listeners if a song is a hit or a miss. Wengine wakitoa ngoma kutoka
majuu, no one subjects it to that kind of question. Hao huingiza kwa
system na inaplay. I believe kazi ya DJ ni kubreak ngoma ikue kubwa
but ukipeleka song kwa DJ na ankuambia uache ishike kwanza ndio uilete!
Nani atashikisha?" Crème added.
