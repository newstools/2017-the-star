West Pokot parents yesterday were warned they risk jail if they subject their girls to female genital mutilation and early marriage.  December school holidays are the favoured season for mutilation. West Pokot Director of Education Jared Obiero yesterday said parents who marry off their daughters at an early age risk a one-year jail term. “The Constitution stipulates that each child needs to be taken to school,” he said.  The county is among regions with a high rate of FGM and early marriages, especially during school holidays.  These practices have hurt girls’ education. Obiero said 30 per cent of girls in the county do not go to school. “We need to educate our girls,” he said. Obiero spoke at Masol Secondary School. He also urged women to enroll for adult education to reduce illiteracy. “I know most of you were not lucky to get an education due to culture. But all is not lost as you can enroll for adult education,” Obiero said. He urged women to be on the lookout for business opportunities. “Join groups to benefit from funds dispensed by the county government to start businesses,” he said.
