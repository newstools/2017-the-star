Thursday was a golden moment for KCPE's finest Goldalyn Kakuya. The girl with albinism got 455 marks at St Anne Junior Lubao in Kakamega. For her extraordinary feat, she was feted by the Albinism Society of Kenya and the Kenya Society for the Blind. The event took place at the Kenya School for the Blind, Nairobi.  She was later given a Sh100,000 cheque and a holiday of five days at a place of her choice with her parents by Bonfire adventures.
