NASA leaders have no right to ask Kenyans to boycott some products and Safaricom services, Bahati MP Kimani Ngunjiri has said. Ngunjiri said the path that the opposition leaders are undertaking will divide Kenyans along tribal lines. "They are behaving like conmen since they continue to draw their salary from the government yet they are busy misleading their voters to boycott some products," he said. Ngunjiri said if the three companies that NASA wants their followers to boycott their products are shut down, all Kenyans including there supporters will suffer. On Friday, opposition MPs asked supporters to boycott products and services by Safaricom, Brookside and Bidco as part of the resistance movement. At a press conference at Okoa Kenya in Nairobi, the leaders wore white T-shirts with clenched fists on them, symbolic of the resistance. They chanted 'Resist!' after each of the companies was mentioned. Their goal - " to bring the institutions to their knees" - follows NASA leader Raila Odinga's announcement that the National Super Alliance had changed into a national resistance movement. The leaders noted the boycott was part of the economic liberation scheme supported by the People's Assembly.
