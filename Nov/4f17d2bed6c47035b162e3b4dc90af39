The 14-day window within which the Supreme Court should hear and determine presidential election petitions is too short and leads to rushed judgments, the International Commission of Jurists has said. The ICJ wants the law amended to have the period extended to at least 30 days. Vice chairman Kelvin Mogeni said the short period exposes the quality of the judgments to scrutiny. “The 14 days that they have given the Supreme Court to hear and determine matters is not enough,” he said. Mogeni continued, “The most logical period that has been thought of, and we have had discussions over that, including with judge [Chief Justice David] Maraga, is that a period of 30 days is adequate.” He spoke on Friday during the close of the Annual Jurists’ Conference in Mombasa. The ICJ is set to release a report compiled by its judges who monitored the first presidential petition (Raila vs the IEBC) after the August 8 General Elections. The report, according to Mogeni, indicates the 14 days are not enough to make a decision. Mogeni said the six-month period in which to determine other election petitions should also be utilised properly. Judges, he said, should not be guided mainly by the length of time within which to issue a verdict on an election petition. “Judges have been very rash in dismissing [election] petitions,” Mogeni said. He continued, “We have six months to determine petitions, not six months to clear petitions.” Mogeni said though there is still room to look into the quality of court decisions on the nonpresidential election petitions, the Constitution provides that justice must be substantive. “The procedural justice that we come up to... is not the way to go,” he said.
