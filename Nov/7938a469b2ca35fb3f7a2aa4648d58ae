DPP Keriako Tobiko yesterday blocked police from charging the late Nyeri Governor Wahome Gakuru’s driver with reckless driving that resulted in a fatal accident. Police had handed Samuel Kinyanjui to court in the morning, ready to charge him. Kinyanjui did not, however, take a plea after the assistant DPP in Murang’a received a letter from his senior. He was instructed to send the file to Nairobi for scrutiny. “Due to the nature and gravity of this matter, the DPP directs that no charges be preferred until and unless the duplicate file has been forwarded to him for perusal and appropriate directions,” assistant DPP Nicholas Mutuku said. “Accordingly, you are hereby directed to call for the relevant police file and forward the same to the DPP for perusal and appropriate directions.” The letter directed that Kinyanjui be released on reasonable police bond. Kinyanjui has been in police custody. He was arrested on Wednesday and detained at the Makuyu police station in Maragua subcounty, Murang’a county. Gakuru, 51, died in a road accident on November 7, after his Mercedes Benz veered off the road and hit a rail guard at Kabati on the Murang’a-Thika highway. He was heading to Nairobi for a radio talk show. Gakuru was in the company of his bodyguard and driver. The county chief will be laid to rest tomorrow at his Nyeri home. His body is at Lee Funeral Home in Nairobi. The burial ceremony will be at Kagumo Boys’ High School grounds. Deputy Governor Mutahi Kahiga has taken the oath of office as the fourth county chief.
