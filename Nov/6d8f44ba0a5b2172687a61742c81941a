not agree with the decision made by our institutions such as the
Supreme Court's ruling, we must at all times respect their decisions. The narrative that the Supreme Court's ruling only bestows legal legitimacy and not

merit," Namwamba said. The council will be unveiling its proposal blueprint on reintroducing the position of the official leader of the opposition in the coming weeks. The council proposes an empowered official leader of opposition, saying it will help consolidate the opposition through a shadow cabinet and support services. "The council is looking forward to a more responsible, mature and patriotic dialogue to heal the nation and empower its people in an inclusive sense," Namwamba said.
