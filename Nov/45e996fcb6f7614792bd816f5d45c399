Diamond Platnumz's brother and vice president of WCB Romy Jons has come out to say that the one thing that might be disturbing WCB members is women. "Tuko na management ama wakubwa ambao wanaturekebisha, tukipost kitu ambacho hakifai wanasema tu pull it down. Wanawake wa Tanzanian wanatupenda sana na social media pia na hao ni shida to the office and in our families," he said. Romy said this in an exclusive interview with Word Is during his visit to Kenyan last weekend. In the past, his brother and the CEO to the record label has been involved in various controversies. Most recently, he cheated on his baby mama Zarina Hassan and impregnated his video vixen Hamisa Mobetto. Rayvanny was involved with a Kenyan socialite, while Harmonize recently broke up with his alleged sponsor girlfriend and is currently seeing a Mzungu chick. Jons is probably the one person who has managed to keep his relationship low-key. He revealed to Word Is he is about to walk down the aisle. "I keep my life private, but I am getting married in December. I'm not going to tell you to whom it is, but I think I'm finally settling down now."
