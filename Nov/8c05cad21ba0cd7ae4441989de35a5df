 CarePay Limited has appointed John Ngumi as the new chairman of the firm’s board of directors. The company, which capitalises on the use of mobile technology to manage healthcare payments between funders, patients and healthcare providers, is the developer of M-Tiba alongside PharmAcess Foundation and Safaricom. Ngumi will be moving from Kenya Pipeline Company from the role of chairman, bringing to CarePay vast experience in investment banking. “CarePay is at the forefront of healthcare inclusion by helping all Kenyans –regardless of income– get access to better healthcare. I am delighted to lead the board, as well as helping expand partnerships and embed the company in Kenyan society,” he said. The firm’s board has also appointed Jagi Gakungu to the board, bringing with him experience in the healthcare sector having worked at AAR for 22 years, 11 of them as CEO of the group. Speaking on the announcement, he said that Kenyans need to access healthcare if the country is going to achieve Vision 2030 goals. “We simply won’t accomplish this without smart, scalable technology solutions, like M-Tiba,” Gakungu said. The CEO, Kees Van Lede, said their experience would be vital in helping the firm bridge the healthcare gap in the country.
