Rabid stray dogs are fast becoming a menace in Nyandarua county, the Agriculture and Livestock department has warned.  "Currently we have a problem in Kanjuiri ward, Ol Kalou, where stray
dogs are killing goats and sheep. We are carrying out baiting so that we
eradicate the menace," Chief officer William Cheriot said. He spoke at Huhoini village, Rurii ward, Ol Kalou,during a farmers' field day to observe World Food Day on Wednesday. Cheriot said animal rights activist are against poisoning of dogs.  He said farmers refuse to take their dogs for vaccination, "forgetting that a rabid dog will first bite you, your livestock, neighbours and then others." "Before we used to charge Sh70 per dog, but nowadays we charge only Sh50. Kanyari said unless 70 per cent of dogs in any given locality are vaccinated, then the populace is not safe. "We have received reports from health facilities that the numbers of
people seeking medical attention after being bitten by dogs have
increased," he said
