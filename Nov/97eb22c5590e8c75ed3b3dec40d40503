The hearing of incitement to violence case against former Machakos senator Johnson Mutham and activist was yesterday adjourned until January 16,2018. Milimani chief magistrate Francis Anday put off the case following an application by lawyer Dr John Khaminwa representing Muthama to have the matter pushed to another date since he (Muthama) was engaged in other official duties which he could not avoid. Muthama is charged alongside activist Japheth Muroko, alias Japhet Thuranira over hate speech remarks and are out on a cash bail of 100,000 each. The charge against the two read that on September 23,2015 at Uhuru Park, Nairobi county, he uttered words in Swahili that have been translated as: “From Friday next week if teachers will have not been paid nobody will go to work and whoever goes shall be stoned, "indicating that it was desirable to bring death and physical injury to persons in Kenya." Muroko alone faced a charge translated from Swahili to mean: "We are saying, the motion being brought to impeach Uhuru, any Member of Parliament who votes against it will be lynched." The offence, according to the prosecution, was committed on September 23, 15 at Uhuru Park, Nairobi.
