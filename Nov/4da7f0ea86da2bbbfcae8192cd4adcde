Police intensified surveillance and patrols in Kawangware on Monday following violence that broke out on Sunday evening. Congo slums and Kawangware area 56 remained tense as groups engaged anti-riot police officers in
running battles. They hurled stones
and explosive materials at the officers and barricaded roads.  Police
fired tear gas several times to disperse the irate youths who hid behind roadside shacks and resurfaced the officers stopped pursuing them. The officers were ferried to the place in two lorries
and also had two water cannon trucks. However, they were unable to penetrate the
slum and only hurled tear gas canisters from the road. A police helicopter also hovered over the area. Some residents told The Star that the Sunday protests followed the killing of five people in Baba Dogo. "They
attacked our colleagues in Baba Dogo and there was information the same
people who killed NASA supporters on Baba Dogo were coming here. This
was a way of protecting ourselves," Samson Nyongesa said. Another resident said hell broke loose when police officers started beating people and hurling tear gas even in the houses.  "After that, everybody came out to protest," they said. Only a few traders were at the ever-busy Kawangware market and most shops,
especially along Muthiora and Salim roads, remained closed. Gregory
Kaserua, proprietor of Generation Bar and Restaurant situated on Salim
Road in Congo, said goons took advantage of the Sunday and Monday's
situation to break into shops. "They hurt me on the hand. They
were robbing people and those who resisted were stabbed. All this started when police arrived," Kaseru said. This was the second
time violence broke out in Kawangware in a span of less than two
months.  Last month, several people were injured after NASA
and Jubilee supporters clashed. Read: In edgy Kawangware, a rumour ends in fires and a death Also read: Teargas in Kawangware after protesters hurl stones at Matiang'i convoy
