Fifteen inmates at the Bungoma prison yesterday joined other standard eight candidates to sit the KCPE exam. The 15 were part of 17, who had registered to sit the exam this year. However, two were released from the prison before the exam began. Social welfare officers at the prison inspector Stephen Githinji said the 15 inmates have been prepared well for the exam. He said they are optimistic the 15 will excel in the exam. Githinji said they tried to contact the two who were released to go sit the exam, but they refused. "Most of those sitting the exam have been doing well in their studies," he said. Githinji said the facility has a number of P1 teachers and volunteer inmates, who have been teaching the candidates. He said last year they had registered 16 candidates, but only 14 sat the exam. Joseph Makhanu, 65, is among the candidates. He is the oldest inmates sitting the exam. Makhanu said his father was poor and could not afford to take him to school. He said he wants to be a doctor if he gets a chance to continue with education. "I was arrested and jailed for 10 years and I have now completed seven," Makhanu said. The grandfather of four from Kiminini in Trans Nzoia county said he was wrongly accused of defilement and he could not defend himself. John Waliaula, 19, who is serving a two years sentence said he dropped out of school in standard seven after his parents died. He said he was arrested for stealing in a workshop, where he used to work. "I have always dreamt of becoming a doctor. When I complete my sentence next year and get a sponsor I will further my studies," Waliaula said He said he hopes to attain 375 marks and above and join a national school.  "This will enable me help my siblings and family members back at home," Waliaula said. A total of 45,000 candidates are expected to seat for the exam in the county. Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati witnessed the start of the exam at Kanduyi DEB school, where he sat his CPE exam in 1983.
