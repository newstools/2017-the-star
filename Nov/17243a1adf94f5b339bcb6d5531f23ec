High Court judge Alfred Mabeya has ordered the scrutiny of forms 37A and KIEMS kits starting December 5 in the Wajir governor election petition.Former Governor Ahmed Abdullahi is challenging the victory of Mohamed Mahamud. Mabeya ruled that recounting of votes will take place in 51 polling stations. He added that no parties will pay for the transportation costs as only the IEBC to will conduct the process. This is after Mohamud’s lawyer argued that transporting election materials from Wajir to Nairobi might result in some being tampered with. Abdullahi and Mohamed Abdi opposed the respondent’s application when he suggested that KIEMS be used for the different constituencies since there are many petitions ongoing.
