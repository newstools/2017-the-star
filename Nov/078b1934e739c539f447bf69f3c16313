Some 195 teachers from Kiambu county have been trained in ICT by the UN's Global E-schools and Communities Initiative. The aim of the programme is to improve the quality and effectiveness of education through ICT.  Twenty secondary schools have been identified for the pilot of the Africa Digital Schools Initiative. The four-year programme will be executed through integration of ICT in teaching, learning and management. Some 80 schools have been earmarked for the Sh750 million ICT programme to be implemented by GESCI, the AU Commission and the Education ministry, with support from the MasterCard Foundatio. Teachers Service Commission directorÂ Kiambu county Lilian Mwangi said TSC will recognise teachers who come up with the best ICT integration lessons through ADSI. She spoke on Tuesday in Kiambu town.  "The programme facilitates the deep integration of ICT on a whole
school basis and TSC will recognise teachers' efforts to help students
learn effectively," Mwangi said.
