Two gold miners in Suna West died on Sunday after Sindule mine collapsed on them.  The bodies of Peter Otieno and Samuel Ochieng’, a form one student at Got Kachola Mixed Secondary School, have yet be retrieved.   “A huge stone crushed the two,” miner Joseph Otieno said.  Ochieng sought to raise his next term school fees.  Mothers of the two said they had warned their sons against skipping church services and going to the deathtrap.  The Migori county government, led by Disaster Management CEC Elijah Odhiambo, visited the scene on Tuesday and provided a bigger water pump and Sh40,000 to help in the recovery efforts.  Families of the deceased also got Sh10,000 each for burial arrangements.  “We hope the bodies will be retrieved soon,” Odhiambo said. He said the accident was caused by a downpour and urged miners to put their safety first. “We’ll temporarily close the mines,” Odhiambo said.  Six people have died in the mine in the past year.
