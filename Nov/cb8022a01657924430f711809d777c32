Ugenya MP Chris Karan has been locked out of a petition challenging his win after he presented a fake document in court. Karan was the third respondent in the case filed by former MP Dave Ochieng.  He responded to the petition after the deadline and later said he was hospitalised in Mombasa.  On Thursday, however, the court found Karan had presented a falsified letter showing he was in hospital. "When we wrote to the facility, the hospital disowned the MP and the letter he purported to have been given at the facility," Ochieng's lawyer Daniel Achacha told the press later. High Court judge Trisphisa Cherere expunged all documents presented by Karan's lawyers. The case will continue on December 4 without the MP. Ochieng has cited electoral malpractice. The former MP ran on the Movement for Democracy on Growth party ticket in the August 8 Genral Election. He got 23,418 votes against ODM’s Karan's 23,765 — a difference of 347 votes.
