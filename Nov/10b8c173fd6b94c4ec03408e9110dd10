The new NASA leadership lineup in Parliament has triggered an uproar within the opposition, posing a fresh challenge to ODM boss Raila Odinga. MPs from the Coast region yesterday rejected the lineup and warned it could mark the end of NASA.

In the new headship, Suba East MP John Mbadi (ODM) will be the Minority leader and deputised by Kathiani MP Robert Mbui of Wiper. Suna East MP Junet Mohamed (ODM) will be the Minority whip, with Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa (Ford Kenya) as his deputy. Addressing the press in Parliament, the more than 20 MPs led by Coast Parliamentary Group chairman Suleiman Dori (Mswambweni) and Mishi Mboko (Likoni) said they will not recognise the list. The legislators claimed there was neither consultation nor a Parliamentary Group meeting of the four affiliate parties to agree on the list. The politicians accused unnamed people within ODM of “manufacturing” the minutes appointing the four. "There is no regional balance and gender balance in this list. We had requested Raila Odinga to give us [Coast] some slots, but it's unfortunate we have not been considered. If no changes are made, we will not accept to be used," Dori said. He continued, "We are doing business where we are not being recognised. We are not valued in NASA and if we are not recognised, we will resist them." Borabu MP Ben Momanyi (Wiper) said NASA does not belong to one community. He said the group will not take instructions from NASA principals unless the list is recalled. "...Just as he (Raila) said he does not recognise Uhuru Kenyatta as the President, we will also not recognise the list," he said.   Click here for the latest political news
