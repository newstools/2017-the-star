A 15-year-old boy was shot dead on Tuesday evening by bandits in Takaiywa village at the border of West Pokot and Turkana counties. No animals were stolen.  Police said the bandits were on a mission to kill and terrorise, not steal animals. Ngiro Namuke was herding goats when the attackers ambushed him. The bandits fled to Turkana.  Tension remains high at the border. Chief Joseph Korkimul yesterday said Namuke was sprayed with bullets. Residents pursued the bandits, but attackers overpowered the Kenya Police Reservists during a two-hour gunfight. “I condemn the killings. The criminals had no intension of stealing livestock. They were just on a mission to kill. The community is worried. They fear the bandits may strike again.” Korkimul said. Police and GSU officers have been deployed to the Turkwel Corridor to ease tension to avert retaliatory attacks. Korkimul urged the government to deploy more officers. He wants the Turkana and Pokot communities to hold joint peace meetings to find a lasting solution.
