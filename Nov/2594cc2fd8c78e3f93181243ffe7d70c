NASA leaders are investigating companies linked to August 8 election rigging so more can be added to the boycott list, Kisumu Senator Fred Outa has said. The National Super Alliance asked its backers to boycott Safaricom, Bidco, and Brookside Dairy products. The Opposition led by veteran politician Raila Odinga accused the firms of working with "Jubilee administration to deny Kenyans election justice." Safaricom, KIEMS kits provider OT-Morpho, ballot papers printer Al Ghurair have denied claims they were involved in rigging the election. The other organisations have not responded since the Opposition made the call.

Outa claimed the organisations are out to derail free, fair and credible elections so they must be ready to pay the price. "The targeted companies must feel the pinch of
election injustice. They cannot defeat the will of the people." The former Nyando MP noted no amount of pressure will make NASA leaders relent in their quest to end impunity, bad governance and election rigging. Companies affected by the boycott have recorded a drop in sales forcing them to cut prices and offer incentives.
