Nakuru Governor Lee Kinyanjui has said the products boycott by the NASA leadership is uncalled for. He said it will jeopardise the economy and heighten division. Kinyanjui said it will lead to layoffs. “Why would affected companies continue supporting a group of people who are actively working for their downfall? Massive layoffs will come for perceived sympathisers,” he said. Kinyanjui spoke in Kuresoi on Saturday during the burial of former Kericho Teachers’ Training College tutor Joseph Kilel. He urged Kenyans to pray for opposition chief Raila Odinga, saying losing five presidential elections has affected him.  “As a politician, I understand how traumatising it is to lose an election...he must be suffering,” Kinyanjui said.  “He should accept Kenyans’ decision and retire peacefully.”  Kinyanjui told Raila to field one of his descendants to run against Deputy President William Ruto in 2022.  Area woman rep Liza Chelule said, “We know that Raila has hit the wall, and few days are remaining and he will find himself in his Bondo home relaxing. He is now at Awasi.”
