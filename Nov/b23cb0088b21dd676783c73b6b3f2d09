The police have been asked to secure the release of 22 Kenyan fishermen arrested by Ugandan police on Migingo Island. Friction has increased on the island after more Ugandan fishermen arrived there last month. The dispute over Migingo dates back to 2004 when it was occupied by Ugandan police. In 2009 a joint East African team was set up to map the lake border but it never finished its work. Initial indications were that Migingo is 500 metres inside Kenya. However Kenya only owns 6 percent of Lake Victoria compared to 45 percent for Uganda and 49 percent for Tanzania. Yet Kenya exports more fish from Lake Victoria than Uganda or Tanzania because it is fishing heavily in neighbouring waters. That is the essence of the problem. To solve this problem, government should go to the International Court of Justice to adjudicate on the borderline with Uganda since it cannot be resolved bilaterally. And then it should negotiate with the Kampala government to secure fishing quotas for Kenyan fishermen in Ugandan waters.    Quote of the day: "If you make a decision to fight for future of your own country you have to consider all the consequences." - Garry Kasparov became World Chess Champion on 9 November, 1985
