The government will from January phase out crop varieties that are more than 10 years old to improve production. Agriculture Principal Secretary Richard Lesiyampe yesterday said they want to replace old varieties with high yielding alternatives which are tolerant to both diseases and drought.  “We will be working with our research institution like Kalro and  the Kenya Plant Health Inspectorate Service to phase out varieties which are not adding value to farmers,” Lesiyampe said. Some hybrid maize varieties, like the 614, have been in the market since 1940 when it was first developed and should be phased out. Lesiyampe said there will be no timeline for the phase-out. “It will be done systemically. There will be capacity building and awareness creation so that farmerfs are informed on the varieties that will no longer be availed in the market,” Lesiyampe said.  Crop management director in the ministry Johnston Irungu said Kephis had established that the new varieties to be released to the market have advantages over the old ones. Kenya Seed Company managing director Azariah Soi said they will identify, for replacement, maize varieties that have been in production for too long and whose yields have decreased.  Soi said they will also identify areas that are ideal for each variety for maximum yield. Last month, breeders identified H622, H511, H614, H611, H612D, Kat CB and H513 as some of the hybrid maize varieties to be replaced.  “This will be a great policy if it is implemented so that farmers are able to cope with the emerging challenges like diseases and drought,” Kalro scientist Murenga Mwimali said.  Mwimali said seed replacement should be done after every five to 10 years. “It is happening in Japan, Taiwan, India, USA and Spain where new improved varieties of crops or hybrids are replaced after certain years to boost high production,” Mwimali said.
