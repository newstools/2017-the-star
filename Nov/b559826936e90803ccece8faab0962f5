World record holder Mary Keitany will seek to clinch a fourth straight win when she lines up at the New York City Marathon tomorrow. Keitany, fresh from winning the Great North Run in September in 1:05:59, has a personal best of 2:17:01 she clocked in London earlier in this year. The 35 year-old may not have enjoyed immediate success in her marathon career – finishing third in New York in both 2010 and 2011 – but in the years since, she has been indomitable on the streets of the Big Apple. At the London Marathon in April, she split a lightning-fast 1:06:54 for the first half, and such a strategy is unlikely to be employed on the more undulating New York course, though Keitany has indicated she will target the course record of 2:22:31. However, she will face stiff competition from the two-time World champion Edna Kiplagat, who took victory at the Boston Marathon earlier this year in 2:21:52. The 38-year-old made a quick turnaround to finish second in the marathon at the IAAF World Championships in London in 2:27:18, which will make New York her third marathon in seven months. With a personal best of 2:19:50 – run to win the London Marathon in 2014 – and Kiplagat showing no visible signs of decline, it would be unwise to count her out. The men’s race, in contrast, appears wide open, with defending champion Ghirmay Ghebreslassie taking on a host of formidable pretenders to his throne. The Ethiopian charge will be led by Lemi Berhanu and Lelisa Desisa. Berhanu holds a best of 2:04:33, run in Dubai last year, and just a few months after that he took victory at the Boston Marathon in 2:12:45. However, he failed to finish on his return there this year, so remains something of an unknown quantity in Sunday’s race. Desisa, meanwhile, has been quiet since taking part in Nike’s Breaking2 marathon attempt in May. The 27-year-old Ethiopian finished second to Wilson Kipsang here in 2014, third in 2015, then second in Boston last year. Another strong contender who should not be overlooked is Geoffrey Kamworor, one of the most versatile and accomplished distance runners in the world. The 24-year-old Kenyan impressed on his last visit to the New York City Marathon in 2015, when he finished second in 2:10:48, and he has a 2:06:12 PB to his name. A two-time winner of both the IAAF World Cross Country Championships and IAAF World Half Marathon Championships, he brings a thoroughbred racing pedigree to the 42km distance, and few of his rivals will want him within striking distance when the race reaches its finale in Central Park.
