Sarah Muthoni and Sharon Zainab have been called to the national under-20 side ahead of a crucial World Cup Qualifier return leg match at Kenyatta Stadium, Machakos on Sunday. Coach Caroline Ajowi believes Muthoni, of Kariobangi North Girls and Zainab, from Nginda Girls, will be key as the junior Starlets seek to overturn a 5-0 deficit suffered in the reverse fixture in Accra, Ghana two weeks ago. The team have been training at the match venue since their return from Accra on November 7. Ghanaian coach Yosuf Basigi has warned his players against complacency as they seek to defend their huge lead. “It’s not over until its over. Yes, we won comfortably 5-0 and that should make us happy but this is football,” Basigi said. “We can’t relax because we have scored 5-0. They can also bounce back to kick us out of this tournament. We need to keep our preparation up and ensure we get a good result in Kenya.” Basigi said they need to play better than they did in Ghana to make sure they move to next stage. The overall winner will advance to third and final qualifying round ahead of the World Cup to be held in France.
