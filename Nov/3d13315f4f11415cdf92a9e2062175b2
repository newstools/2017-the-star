Former World marathon record holder Wilson Kipsang and Tokyo marathon champion Sarah Chepchirchir have been feted by Kenya Tourism Board. The athletes and their families will spend two days at the Maasai Mara National Reserve and another two in Diani and Kisite Mpunguti Marine. The move is to reward the achievements of Kenya’s marathon champions in enhancing Kenya’s tourism positioning globally. Kipsang and Chepchirchir won and set course records at the 2017 Tokyo Marathon in February. Wilson set a record of 2:03:58 while Sarah clocked 2:19:47. KTB Chief Executive Officer, Betty Radier said the programme is a recognition of the important role Kenyan athletes play in selling Kenya abroad. Radier said: “Kenyan marathon champions are undoubtedly our nation’s best ambassadors given that the races they participate in are held across Kenya’s key tourist source markets. Our athletes rub shoulders with ordinary citizens in the cities hosting the races as well as professional athletes from other nations.” “As the body mandated with the task of marketing Kenya’s tourism products, we recognize the huge profile that our athletic heroes occupy on the world stage. We believe that it is time to involve our athletes in making a pitch for the country as the Magical Kenya brand ambassadors,” added Radier.
