Woman activists in Garissa yesterday held processions through the streets of the town to petition the assembly to enact laws that will end gender violence.  Statistics show Garissa is among the counties that gender-based violence targeting women is on the increase in. In most cases, such incidents go unreported or are resolved through local mechanisms popularly known as ‘maslah’. The activists in their petition demanded the county assembly declare sexual and gender-based violence in the county a matter of serious concern. The procession ended up at the county assembly.  The women presented a written petition received by the assembly’s deputy speaker and Waberi MCA Mohamud Abbas. The lobby groups were led by Pastoral Girl Initiative executive director Fatuma Kinsi. Haki Na Sharia, Refugee Consortium of Kenya, Silver Lining Kenya and Womankind Kenya were also present.  In their petition, they want the county assembly to pass laws that will deal with culprits of gender violence. “We also want the assembly to allocate enough budgetary resources to campaigns and programmes that will promote the fight against gender violence, among them the establishment of a recovery centre for victims,” Kinsi said. She added, “We at the same time want the assembly to pressure the executive to come up with a policy that will guide the relevant laws.” They also want the police to create a hotline number to be used by victims to report cases.  Addressing the women, the deputy speaker promised to present the petition to the assembly for consideration.
