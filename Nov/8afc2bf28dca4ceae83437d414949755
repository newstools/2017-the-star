The Kenya National Union of Teachers Western Region Council has praised the endorsement of Wycliffe Omucheyi (pictured) as the acting national union chairman. Speaking in Kakamega town yesterday, Western region chairman Patrick Chungani said they will attend the 60th annual delegates’ conference in Mombasa on December 13 to confirm Omucheyi to the position. He has been proposed to the position following the retirement of Mudzo Nzili due in May. “Omucheyi is competent enough to hold the position since, after the demise of John Katumanga and George Wesonga, this position has been held by other regions. It’s now our turn,” Chungani said. He appealed to delegates from other regions to support Western to get the national chairman position for them to earn the support of the region when their time comes. “All teacher leaders of Western must come out in solidarity to voice and welcome this great position,” Chungani said.
