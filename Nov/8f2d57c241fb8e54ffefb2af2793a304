Residents of Kimnai village in Marakwet West are counting losses after suspected wild dogs killed tens of sheep and sucked their blood. Rhoda Yator said she lost 17 sheep last week Wednesday, while Hillary Kipkosgei puts the death toll in one week at 70. The animals only suck blood and leave the carcasses. Elgeyo Marakwet Kenya Wildlife Services senior warden John Ngalia said they also suspect a leopard. He said they have received reports of 15 sheep killed. It is believed the animal strikes from the nearby Kipkunur Forest. Similar attacks have been reported from the nearby Kamasat village. “Our officers will take a trap to the area. But it is quite difficult to trap wild dogs,” Ngalia said. He said KWS will compensate the farmers.
