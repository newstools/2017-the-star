Nine Nyeri county executives yesterday were sworn in again, just three days after new Governor Mutahi Kahiga took the oath of office.  Speaker John Kaguchia said the repeat swearing-in was necessary because a new governor had taken over. “It was done on the advice of the  Attorney General. It is what the law requires,” Kaguchia said.  The exeutive members were sworn in at the Nyeri Anti-Corruption Court, in a move Kahiga said was a warning that they risk being charged in the same court if they engage in graft. They first received their acceptance letters before taking the oath of office administered by chief magistrate Wendy Kagendo. Kahiga witnessed the event.  The executives had been appointed by Governor Wahome Gakuru who died last week. Kahiga promised to work with them, saying he helped select them.
