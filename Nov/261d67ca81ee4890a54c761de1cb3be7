At least 213 people, including 134 pedestrians, have perished on 13 city roads since January, the National Transport and Safety Authority has said. The authority attributed this to vandalism of guard rails, failure to use footbridges, speeding vehicles and lack of pedestrian walkways. Thika Superhighway leads in fatalities. Thirty-one people were killed between January and October 29, 14 of them pedestrians, two drivers and nine passengers. Some 45 people died on the road last year. It is closely followed by Mombasa Road, where at least 30 people, including 20 pedestrians, four drivers and a passenger, were killed over the period. Some 48 people perished on the road in 2016. NTSA Road Safety manager Samuel Musumba said the road has suffered “the worst form” of vandalism of pedestrian fences (guard rails) erected to prevent people from crossing at undesignated points. “This is one of the busiest roads. Vehicles plying both short and long routes use it. “We partnered with corporates and organisations to erect pedestrian fences but vandalism has been worse on this road,” he said. Musumba said most roads were built long ago and pathways for non-motorised transport were not factored in. “The population of Nairobi has grown. Vehicles have increased in number yet our roads are still the same way they used to be. “So you find there is both human and vehicle traffic, thus the high number of accidents,” he said. Twenty-seven people were killed on Waiyaki Way, including 20 pedestrians and two passengers. Some 22 people were killed on Kangundo Road, 20 on the Eastern Bypass, 16 on Jogoo Road and 15 on the Southern Bypass.
