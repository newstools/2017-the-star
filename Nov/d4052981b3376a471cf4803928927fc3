Kenyans and Ugandans were shocked on Wednesday when President Yoweri Museveni asked police to "avoid umalaya, alcohol and corruption". This was what he wrote on Twitter while congratulating officers, whom he noted have bright futures. Uganda's New Vision said the President addressed the passing-out parade of people who had finished a combined arms field training course in air-field, tank, artillery, and infantry. The ceremony took place at Karama Armoured War Fare Training School in Mubende district. "Congratulations to the crews...my advice to them is that they should avoid risky lifestyles - avoid umalaya, alcohol and corruption. Their future is bright," Museveni said. Umalaya is the Kiswahili word for prostitution. Museveni's message left many wondering if his Twitter account had been hacked or if he intentionally used the word. "Underline umalaya," '@geomisati' said. '@WEshiwani' said: "...too vulgar....but the message is super for them to live long [should they be] faithful to only one." "...tell them to use condoms; that's more realistic. Alcohol should be used in moderation. As for corruption, well, that's a long shot considering your own family has been associated with the same," '@kiplimo_dc' said. '@ngungah' wrote: "...let them avoid it but ni ngumu (it is hard) for men in uniform." "What a speech," '@ledamasempele' said and noted 'zero chills' by the Chief of General Staff But Benson Chockbar said: "It's not risky behaviour. It's just a way of saying 'thank you' to the body that works every day." Museveni told the servicemen that the government would address institutional housing and salary concerns by soldiers, public servants, health workers and teachers.
