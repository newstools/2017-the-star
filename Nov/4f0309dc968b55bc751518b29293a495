Harambee Stars new head coach Paul Put has said national team players must get a ‘technical renewal’ if they are to make the 2019 Cup of Nations a ‘mission possible.’ Kenya missed the 31st edition played in Gabon early this year. The Belgian said a similar ‘renewal’ saw him lift Afcon titles with Gambia and Bukina Faso before leading Jordan to the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. “I cannot afford to do less of what Victor [Wanyama] is doing at Tottenham. This will boost other players,” he said. Put said his technical bench must have match analysers and player trackers who will keenly track both local and foreign players. “We must keep that contact and full a report provided,” he said. The head coach said he might bring on board the bench he had in previous assignments. “My assistant in Burkina went with me to Jordan.” However, Football Kenya Federation president Nick Mwendwa said they want the immediate former head coach Stanley Okumbi to be Put’s assistant. “We have requested the coach to keep some people. We are discussing that… Stanley will stay, others will not,” Mwendwa said. Put said: “If president let me work, we can come out with one unit. I will bring people on board to help Kenya get great results and they won’t be expensive.” The bench to reconstituted has former Kenyan international Musa Otieno as the first assistant, Frank Ouna as second assistant coach and team manager. Put said the upcoming Cecafa Senior Challenge will be used to gauge the players. “Football is not only about field technicalities, I have to involve the players, talk to them and make my first move. I will interfere if necessary,” he said.
