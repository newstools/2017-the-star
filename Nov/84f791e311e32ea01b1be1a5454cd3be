The High Court in Malindi on Friday consolidated two election petitions challenging the education qualifications and election victory of Tana River Governor Dhadho Godhana. Justice Asenath Ongeri ordered the two petitions seeking nullification of the election consolidated and heard as one. The petitions are filed by Tana River resident Mohamed Hatu, challenging the governor’s degree and the other by former Governor Hussein Dado. Ongeri directed all parties to file interlocutory applications before the pretrial within three days from the date of the ruling. Hatu said Godhana has a Bachelor’s degree from Kimmage Development Studies Centre in Tanzania, which is said to be affiliated to a university in Ireland. Hatu said it is not recognised by the Kenyan Commission for University Education. The case was set for December 7.
