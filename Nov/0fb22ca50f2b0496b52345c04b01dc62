Starehe MP candidate Steve Mbogo yesterday told a court he was attacked and his agents stabbed during the August 8 General Election. He has challenged Jubilee’s Charles Njagua’s win. Mbogo told Justice Fred Ochieng he was denied entry into Pumwani Secondary School polling station. He said there was massive ballot-stuffing by his opponent. Mbogo asked the court to order the IEBC to conduct a fresh election. Researcher Dr Nyanduso Oduo told court he found anomalies in 160 Forms 34A after scrutinising 181 forms. He told Justice Ochieng the forms did not bear the IEBC’s official stamp and they were not signed by the presiding officer and his deputy.
