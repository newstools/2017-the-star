Kenya aced the KCPE exam in many ways — high scoring, no cheating, fast marking, efficiency and fast results released yesterday.  Nearly a million pupils defied the charged, sometimes violent political season and interruptions — including tear gas  and evacuated classrooms — to
score overall better results than last year. Many students shone and some dazzled. They sat exams against a backdrop of acrimonious campaigns and tension as the country headed into and held the presidential rerun on October 26. Pupils in public schools registered marked improvement compared with last year. The national
percentage of girls increased and in some counties more girls than boys sat the exams. Overall improved performance was largely attributed to strong preparation of candidates under a strict new exam regime. Release of the KCPE results was historic in itself.  First, it was the first
time the ministry of Education released results within three weeks, thanks to new information technology. Second, all candidates who sat the exam got their results are all guaranteed a place in Form One. This is part of the new state policy of 100 per cent transition to secondary schools.  "All children should prepare
to be admitted to any school categories available, meaning no parent should not worry about their children remaining at home for lack of a Form
One place," Education CS Fred Matiang'i told the media while releasing results yesterday.   A total of 993,718 candidates sat this year's exam. Of these, 498,775
(50.19 per cent) were boys and 494,943 (49.81 per cent) girls. In the 2016, 942,021
candidates sat the exam.  Performance improved in English, Kiswahili, Mathematics, Kenyan Sign
Language and Religious Education. The strict collective management of exams by government agencies meant there was zero leakage or genera irregularities. The marking and overall posting of exam results were termed 99.98 percent accurate by experts. This year's top
student nationally scooped 455 marks, compared with last year's who got
437 marks. There was also a drop in number of pupils who scored below 100 marks — 2,360 this year compared with 6,747 last year. The number scoring
400 marks and above also rose to 9,846, compared with 5,143 last year. Those scoring 300 and above numbered 217,307 candidates
compared with 207,141 last year. Of the 993,718
pupils who sat the exam, 757,050 scored above average — earning 201-500 marks, with only 236,668 pupils scoring below 200. Of the 942,021
candidates who sat exams last year, 713,836 scored above average, while
228,185 earned less than 200 marks. “The general
improvement in candidates' performance this years is largely
attributed to adequate preparation of candidates by teachers
under the new stringent examination regime,” Matiang'i said at Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development. Public schools, which
have been doing poorly in recent years, are making a comeback — producing the second-best student
nationally. Matiang'i said improved scores in public schools proved strong exam performance is not the preserve of private schools. It also shows that performance
appraisals for teachers is working, he said, pledging more support for
teachers to improve their own performance. “It makes us proud. We have been making the case
for public schools and our efforts are
paying off. Public education has been on decline because of
disinterest in investments in the sector and teachers. But now it seems we are getting serious and seeing this
improvement,” KNUT secretary general
Wilson Sossion said. Matiang'i promised
a special allocation to improve infrastructure and build
capacity in all public schools. Students in the top 100 category that had improved in performance, as the Teachers Service
Commission pledged to reward heads of those schools. The number of
no-show candidates dropped by 6.20
per cent from 10,367 in 2016 to 9,724 this year. Social studies, science and religious education registered lower scores, despite overall improved performance. In 2016 of 942,021 candidates who sat exams 468,518 were girls compared to
this year's 494,943. This year, the percentage
increase in the number of girls, 5.64 per cent was higher
than that of boys, 5.34 percent.
 “An analysis of
candidate trends by gender in the last four years indicates  the
percentage increase in the number of girls has consistently been
higher than that boys over this period,” Matiang'i said. He added that  27
counties registered more girls than boys, compared with 23
in 2016. Kakamega, Meru,
Bungoma, Nairobi, Embu Machakos, Vihiga, Kisii, Kitui are among the
counties having more girls than boys. Others are Nyamira, Nyeri, Laikipia, Kiambu, Nandi, Uasin Gishu, Bomet,
Trans Nzoia, Kisumu, Nakuru, Mombasa, among others. Nairobi had 56,073
candidates, followed by Nakuru with 50,046, Kakamega 46,448 and
Bungoma with 45,161 closing the ranking of counties with highest 
number of candidates. Kenya National
Examination Council chairman George Magoha said they had innovated
new ways of administering examinations,overhauling a 17-year-old system and sealing loopholes  for leakages and other malpractices,
including incidences of missing marks. “Every Kenyan
child had equal opportunity to sit for the exams no one had undue
advantage as the entire examination process was securer, tamper-prof
with zero errors,” he said. Unlike previous
years where form selection was done in the beginning the new year,
this year's selection process will kick off on December 4. All
candidates know their high schools before
December 12. All those who scored
over 400 marks will be placed in public national schools, regardless of whether they studied in private or public primaries. The move is aimed at ending discrimination and rewarding merits. “All candidates
who will receive results today are guaranteed a place in form one
following the government's new policy of 100 percent transition to
secondary schools,” Matiang'i said.
