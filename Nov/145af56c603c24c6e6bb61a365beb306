Agriculture PS Richard Lesiyampe has urged Meru county youths to venture into coffee farming as a long-term investment. Through a statement read by Agriculture and Food Authority director general Afred Tabu, the PS said the decline in coffee production is partly attributed to ageing coffee farmers, hence the need for youths to engage in the sector. Lesiyampe said the government has introduced a number of measures to revive the sector. The reforms include abolishing the four per cent levy and disbursement of commodities funds since 2007. He said Sh2 billion has been disbursed. Farmers also benefit from subsidised fertiliser and disease-tolerant seeds, Lesiyampe added. “The President appointed a national coffee task force to enhance the coffee subsector through capacity building, enhancement of youth participation in the coffee value chain and establishment of a revolving fund to break the lengthy systemic payment delays farmers experience,” he said.  Meanwhile, farmers complained that the Kenya Planters’ Cooperative Union has withheld Sh135 million.  Stephen Kiria, chairman of the Kimachia factory in Tigania West, said the KPCU has withheld the cash and this demoralises farmers. Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi said the national and county governments have partnered to explore methods by which quick payments will be made.  Kiraitu said on Friday the county is piloting the cash model used by the Ethiopian coffee industry.
