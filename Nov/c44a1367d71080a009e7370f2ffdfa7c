The cases of police killing people indiscriminately in post-election violence since August are deeply worrying. The police have been in no life-threatening situations throughout the prolonged election cycle of the last four months and none of the victims was armed. The victims include babies and preteenagers. Even among the adults, none of them can be said to have posed a threat to heavily armed riot police. The police have been at no risk. It is clearly high time the police stopped the use of live bullets during unarmed demonstrations. The police have rubber bullets, why do they not use them? And why is there no fear of prosecutions in the National Police Service? What governs the police use of force and levels of force against unarmed civilians? Is police escalation of force during demonstrations lawful? The Policing Oversight Authority, established by the 2010 Constitution, should intervene in police crowd control during unarmed demonstrations. Ipoa should also help reform the policeâ€™s gun culture and discourage the use of deadly force in residential areas.
