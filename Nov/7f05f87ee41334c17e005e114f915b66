The Independent Elections and Boundaries Commission yesterday confirmed that senatorial election results in Lamu had arithmetic errors. Lamu IEBC returning officer Mohamed Adan is a witness in a petition filed against the victory of Senator Anwar Loitiptip. He said he used MS Excel to auto-sum the results, which led to small errors.  Aden was testifying before High Court judge Asenath Ongeri sitting in Malindi. He said he is ‘hopeful’ the results would match once the ballot boxes are reopened.  During cross-examination by petitioner Hassan Albeity’s lawyer Abubakar Yusuf he also confirmed there were errors in some polling stations in the total number of valid votes cast.
