President Uhuru Kenyatta's threat to "fix" the judiciary played a major role in Monday's ruling that upheld his re-election on October 26, Kimilili MP Chris Wamalwa has said.  Wamalwa said the judges were facing constant threats from the executive. He said their body language showed that there were under intimidations. "President Uhuru openly promised to fix the judiciary after the annulment of his August win, the Monday's ruling clearly indicates that the intimidations worked," Wamalwa said. He said the court struck out most evidence that was presented by the petitioners. The legislature asked President Uhuru and NASA leader Raila Odinga to dialogue to unite the country as it is too divided. “We don’t want Kenya to burn, if it burns many people will suffer, we want to live in peace,” he said. He was speaking in Kitale court after attending a hearing of a petition against Trans Nzoia  Governor Patrick Khaemba. The MP said that the sovereignty of the people belongs to the people. He quoted Martin Luther King Junior ‘we must learn to live together as brothers if not we shall perish as fools’.
