Tanzanian bongo stars Offside Trick have denied that they were bundled off stage at the Lamu Festival because of their raunchy dance routine. "We performed our set from beginning to end without any interruptions. The only issue was one associated with Lamu's conservative culture and religion. When we were performing our third song, one of the organisers pointed out a dancer whom they said was dancing too sexily for the conservative crowd," Lil Ghetto told Word Is. "Tukamuuliza kwa nini hawakutuambia mapema wakati wanajua jinsi sisi tunavyofanya show? Na ndivyo tunavyofanya show zetu zote. Tukamwambia basi ongee na audience, akasimama akasema yule dada akae pembeni, audience wakaanza kumzomea wakisema hatutaki tunataka waendelee. Unapomwalika msanii kwenye show unakua tayari unajua background yake, tunapofanya show wakati wote tunafanya na dancers na tuliporudi huku Tanzania tukawa tunasikia mambo mengine." The Lamu Cultural Promotional Group officials placed the blame squarely on the county government. “We aren't responsible for what happened. The artistes were invited and sponsored by the county government. We, however, blame the artistes, too, since we understand they were to only perform Taarab songs, but went way beyond the agreement. In fact, we expect the county government to take action against them,” LCPG chair Ghalib Alwy said. Event organisers and area leaders reportedly had to the podium, switch off the microphones and forcibly drag the dancers and singers from the stage. Lil Ghetto termed this "pure lies". "Huo ni uongo kabisa, sisi tumeimba nyimbo zetu mpaka tumemaliza kabisa, hawajatuambia tunatakiwa kushuka stage, hawajatamka hilo neno. Walitamka kwamba huyu dada atakuja kutuletea mazingira tofauti kulingana na hali yetu hapa Lamu. Tukamruhusu atoke lakini mashabiki wakakataa."
