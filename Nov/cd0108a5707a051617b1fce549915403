The hearing of a petition filed by Citizens Convention Party
leader Grace Akumu challenging election of Kisumu woman representative
Rosa Buyu continued yesterday at the High Court in Kisumu. Akumu is challenging the election process, saying
the IEBC did not conduct the election within the law. The petitioner wants the court to declare her the legitimate winner of the August 8 election. In her testimony before Justice Thripsisa Cherere, Akumu
said most of the forms 39A, which were used in the election did not have
security features, raising integrity questions of the
results declared by the IEBC. She said while the forms did not have barcodes and
the commission's rubber stamp was missing in most of them.  "The IEBC told my chief agent during training it was a
mandatory for the forms to have the commission's logo," Akumu said. She also told the court that in some polling stations, her
agents were denied access. Akumu cited Kodum and Kogola polling stations in Nyakach
constituency, where her agents were only allowed in at 11am, hours after the voting had started. She also said Buyu had deployed more
than one agent per polling station, which is against the IEBC's rules. IEBC lawyer Zephania Yego on Monday put Akumu to task to explain
why she wants to be declared winner in an election process that
she is challenging. Kisumu returning officer John Lorionokou said
they had allowed candidates to have up to two agents. "A candidate having more than one agent does not affect
results in anyway. There are places where agents are never present, but the
voting takes place,” he said. Buyu said she was duly elected and wants the court to dismiss the case with
costs. The hearing will be on December 8.
