The High Court has barred police from confiscating and killing livestock of pastoralists in Laikipia pending resolution of a case brought by former Laikipia North MP Matthew Lempurkel ( see p33 ). Lempurkel argues that the pastoralists are marginalised and should be compensated for their losses.  There are fundamental flaws in this case. Firstly the court ruling ignored the constitutional right to property. The police have been trying to clear cattle from private land. The pastoralists are not long-term residents and mostly come from Samburu. If this ruling is upheld, then pastoralists will effectively be free to roam wherever they want in Kenya. Secondly the pastoralists are not just invading large ranches. Lempurkel brought his case last week after police shot 75 cattle while clearing invaders in Ol Moran, an area occupied by small farmers whose property had also been destroyed. The court should have made it clear that pastoralists do not have the right to invade private land and that police still have the right to move them on.
