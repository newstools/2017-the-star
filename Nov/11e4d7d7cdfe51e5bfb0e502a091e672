A Malindi High Court Judge has raised concern over an SMS claiming a ruling has been made in favour of Tana River Governor Dhadho Godhana in an election petition. Justice Asenath Ongeti said the information is misleading as the matter is yet to begin hearing. “We are getting reports that some messages are going
round in form of SMS that ruling has been
done, we have not even reached pretrial ,’’ she said on Friday. She asked parties to stop sending such messages as they will cause animosity. “I do not want to hear messages are exchanging, in fact
this is the only petition that we allow supporters. Other petitions we handle
them with lawyers; tell your people not to spread such messages," she added. Ongeti spoke as the court heard application filed in the petition that is yet to officially begin as two matters were consolidated. The SMS purportedly going round reads: "Muyaadze watsakwa… wapokomo wote
wanaombwa kufika Malindi law court leo asubuhi kusheherekea ushindi wa Election
petition ya governor Wetu Major Godhana. Nyote mwaalikwa."  This loosely translates to: "All Pokomos are asked to be at Malindi law
court today morning to celebrate victory of Election petition of our governor
major Dhadho Godhana. All are invited.) The judge called for additional security as many residents turned up to follow the matter. Dhadho's lawyers asked the court to throw out the petition challenging the Governor's education qualifications. Tom Ojienda said the Governor sought clearance from the Commission for University Education for his degree. A petitioner, Mohamed Dado, wanted Dhadho's election nullified for not having a degree recognised by a university in Kenya. He also argued that the August 8 election had irregularities.
