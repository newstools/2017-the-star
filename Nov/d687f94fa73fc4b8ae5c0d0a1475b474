Some 400 Lugari residents received relief food from the national government on Thursday. The food was distributed by deputy county commissioner Agnes Karoki. She said the food is part of the government’s initiative to ensure no citizen dies of hunger. There has, however, been no life-threatening hunger in the region or appeal for relief food by residents. Lugari is the breadbasket for a large part of the former Western province. The opposition, NASA, accused Jubilee of bribing voters with relief food during election campaigns. Karoki said her office had received 69 bags of dry maize, 23 bags of beans and 20 bags of rice. She said the programme targets vulnerable elders from poverty-stricken families in the subcounty.
