Vihiga Governor Wilbur Otichillo has warned unscrupulous health employees who sell drugs supplied by the Kenya Medical Supplies Agency. Addressing health staff before flagging off a consignment of drugs on Saturday, the governor said a new directorate to deal with community health has been formed. Otichillo said software is being installed in all the 53 health centres in the county to monitor the use of the drugs on a daily basis. “In my manifesto, I gave health the first priority. That is why in my first 90 days in office, I am flagging off a consignment of Sh30 million drugs,’” the governor said. Otichillo said he would not fold his arms and watch as drugs are stolen. He thanked the agency for coming up with the software to ease the monitoring of the movement of drugs in county hospitals. He said the agency has been understanding and has given Vihiga county drugs, despite a huge debt left behind by the previous administration. “We inherited a Sh47 million debt, which the former government owes Kemsa. I want to assure you I will pay the money,” Otichillo said. He said the agency has not supplied the county with drugs since 2014. Otichillo said he doesn’t understand how the previous government used to run the health sector without drugs. “I cannot imagine the trouble the people of Vihiga have gone through for the last three years,” the governor said.
