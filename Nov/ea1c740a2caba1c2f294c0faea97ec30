Deputy President William Ruto yesterday asked police to protect the lives and property of all Kenyans. He told police to move with speed and bring perpetrators of the killings and those who destroyed property to book. Ruto said it is unfortunate that innocent Kenyans have lost their lives because of politics. The DP spoke at the St Mark’s ACK Mukui Parish in Kabete during the church’s 43rd anniversary. He said every community has the right to live in Nairobi and any other place in the country, without intimidation. The DP said the government will not spare anyone, including politicians, who is involved in violence. “Nobody is above the law and action will be taken against those inciting Kenyans to violence, irrespective of their social status, political party or where one comes from,” Ruto said. He said Kenya does not belong to criminals and hooliganism, but citizens and patriots who trust the Constitution and the rule of law.  The DP was accompanied by Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu, and MPs Kimani Ichung’wa (Kikuyu), John Kiarie (Dagoretti South), Moses Kuria (Gatundu South), Jude Jomo (Kiambu Town), Jonah Mburu (Lari), Githua Macukuru (Kabete) and Andrew Kagwa (Githunguri).
