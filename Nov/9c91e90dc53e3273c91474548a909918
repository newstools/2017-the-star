Some residents in Nyeri town on Monday cooked and shared a meal of ugali and fish and washed it down with Brookside milk in a show of unity.  The residents gathered at the matatu stage and went ahead to prepare the meal, despite the hustle and bustle. Other residents gathered just to watch the goings on, some from a safe distance.  This was after the Supreme Court validated President Uhuru Kenyatta's win in the October 26 rerun.  Those who came together included Luos, Luhyas, Kambas, Kisiis and Kikuyus. They said all
Kenyans are winners following the ruling and the only way forward is to live in peace, love
and unity. Those present prayed for the meal in their mother tongue as the crowd cheered. The residents said they have lived together for many years and no one should victimise his neighbour because of politics. One woman who has lived in Nyeri for 20 years
urged Kenyans in other towns such as Kisumu, Mombasa and Nairobi to live together
in harmony and peace. Politician Wachira Keen joined them and urged opposition leader Raila Odinga to accept the will of the people.
 “Raila should call his troops to order...so the country can go on. The businesses and lives of every
Kenyan must continue now that election matters are over,” he said. Keen urged Kenyans to live in peace.
