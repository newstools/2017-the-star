Rapper Attitude - real name Malimo Andega - is the talk of town after he posed on Facebook with a gun ranting about demonstrators being killed.  The star who is based in the US, he wrote, "I wish I was on the ground in Kenya right now.. I was born in Atl and have the spirit of the enslaved africans who built this land thru the american families and my friends who were key in nuturing my mind frame.. I don't throw stones or swing nyahunyos.. Tit for tat m*thaf*cka... Stop killing my people.. Not Luos, not Kikuyus... I'm talking about Kenyans.. All of them.... The country belongs to the people not any one administration.. Police are employees of the citizens sworn to protect and serve, not assassinsand bodygaurds for the countries self appointed elite.. Touch one of mine on everything I own I will destroy everything you touch.. #Resist."
