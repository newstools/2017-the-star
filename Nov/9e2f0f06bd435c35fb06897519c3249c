AAR Health Kenya has introduced an arm of Corporate Social Responsibility named Trees for Health. MD Charles Kariuki on Saturday said the arm specifically deals with environment conservation and its target is to plant a tree in honor of all their patients per year. "Today we mark our annual tree planting day at the Ngong road forest and the event being done for the first time since T4H began. We had over 500 people in attendance. T4H programme plants a Tree for every patient seen at our Outpatient Centres and every patient rescued by our emergency rescue services," Kariuki said. He said the occasion was graced by several of our partners including International Peace Support Training Centre, Rotary Club of Nairobi – South, AAR Insurance Kenya , ICEA Lion Group, Uokoaji Sacco, Kenya Wildlife Services, Kenya Forest Services among others.  Kariuki said the outreach programme takes care of both primary and secondary school students who are transitioning to a different level. "T4H ensures the students get career guidance and talks from the professional staff of AAR Healthcare. This is the arm responsible for growing trees and monitoring how they are doing to ensure we live in a very healthy environment," he said. Kariuki said the it is worth noting the exponential growth AAR Healthcare has had by touching at least 716,000 lives in the year 2016. He said they target to at least touch 780,000 in the year 2017. "We are also focusing on growing our outpatient centres from 35 - 75 in in the near future. We are also focusing on increasing the specialist’s services from 20 to 25," he said.
