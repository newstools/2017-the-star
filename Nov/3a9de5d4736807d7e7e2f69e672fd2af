Nakuru traders have been told to create smoking zones to stop endangering the lives of non-smokers. Isabella Karanja from the Tobacco Control Board said “the law is very clear” violations can attract a Sh50,000 fine.  She said they will not relent in enforcing the law and urged all businessmen to comply. The Health ministry and Nakuru’s Health department have launched education campaigns against smoking and all tobacco products. “We’ll be moving to the 11 subcounties in Nakuru to create awareness against smoking before embarking on enforcement,” Karanja said on Tuesday. Health CEC Samuel Mwaura said enforcement officers would visit business premises to monitor compliance.
