Two of Governor Ferdinand Waititu’s allies who were part of the United for Kiambu group that kicked out former Governor William Kabogo have been given county jobs John Mugwe and Aquiline Njoki were sworn in as Roads executive and member of the county public service board. Bishop David Ngari, a real estate mogul popularly known as Gakuyo, will assume the position of political and economic adviser to the governor. “I hope a ceremony for my position will be done,” Gakuyo said during the swearing-in ceremony last Thursday. He was tasked with giving the vote of thanks in the ceremony, despite being said to have provided financial backing to United for Kiambu. Gakuyo said they are still united, despite his not getting an executive position.
