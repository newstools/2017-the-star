Paul Put has been appointed Harambee Stars head coach for two years. The Belgium led Gambia and Bukina Faso to Africa Cup of Nations tournament. He also led Jordan to the 2014 World Cup held in Brazil. Put has been in African football for 12 years. In his acceptance speech on Saturday at English Point Marina during FKF fifth AGM, Put said he will deliver "500 per cent". "I'm ambitious. This is a sign Kenya has confidence in me," he said. Put added, "I'm here to win prices. It is time to right a new page for Kenya and it is possible to raise Kenyan flag high." Stanely Okumbi who had been the head coach since 2016 March is expected to be relegated to the assistant coach position. Put had previously managed Belgian club sides Geel, Lokeren and Lierse, before being banned for three-years by the Royal Belgian Football Association for his alleged involvement in the Ye Zheyun match-fixing scandal. He was shortlisted for the Guinea national team job in July 2016.  In February 2017 he was one of a number of managers on the shortlist for the vacant Rwanda national team manager role.  Okumbi was appointed in March 2016 and since then, has overseen a couple of disappointing results including the home and away losses to lowly Guinea Bissau in the 2017 Africa Nations Cup qualifiers, plus another loss to Sierra Leone in FreeTown in Kenya's opening match of the 2019 Africa Nations Cup qualifiers.
