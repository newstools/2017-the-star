A successful rapper known to have an ego the size of two male grown elephants has pulled another diva move. The artiste refused to be interviewed in one of the trendy Friday night TV shows, demanding the producers cough up a whopping Sh1 million if they really needed him to appear. The artiste, who is well known for his chart-topping love ballad, made a huge comeback after years of taking time off the music industry. "Alisema anataka tumlipe ndio akuje show. Asipochunga ata-fade haraka. Naskia hata amekua akifanyia studio flani hivyo. Kwani yeye ni nani?" our source said. The star has also been accused of ignoring his die-hard fans when he meets them at shows. Guess he hasn't heard Lucky Dube's song, Way It Is.
