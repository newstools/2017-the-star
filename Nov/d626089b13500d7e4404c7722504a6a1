Kenya’s agricultural exports to the European markets are set to increase following the completion of a Sh250 million laboratory complex that will ensure produce meets international standards. Deputy President William Ruto, opening the laboratory that was constructed jointly by the Kenya Plant Health Inspectorate and the European Union, said the project was a milestone in the development of the agricultural sector. The lab which was unveiled yesterday, will ensure fertilisers, seeds, soils and water were tested before being used by farmers. It will also ensure healthy plants, safe trade and a sustainable agro-environment.  Ruto said the lab is ready at a time when there is increasing public demand for quality and safe food worldwide.  “It will help the government to access the international rules for seed, fertiliser and water testing that aid in promoting of trade between Kenya and the EU among other countries,” said  the DP. Addressing Kephis workers at their Karen offices after opening the lab, the DP said the project would lead to increased exports.  He said tests on GMO foods will be done at the lab to allay Kenyans’ fears about them.
