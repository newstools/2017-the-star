NASA principal Moses Wetang’ula has urged the Luhya to unite and revive industries in the region. The Bungoma Senator urged the community to put behind their differences and work for their common good.  Wetang’ula spoke on Saturday at the burial of George Mulama and his nephew, who both died a week ago after falling into a well in Matungu, Kakamega. “Let’s not just watch as Mumias Sugar and other companies fail,” Wetang’ula said. The senator said counties in Western Kenya are negotiating to take over local companies for easier management. “Agriculture is devolved. Our county governments should take up their managerial roles dilligently. We are holding talks over the management of the Nzoia Sugar Company, Bungoma,” Wetang’ula said. He said they are also discussing Rai Paper Mill. Wetang’ula praised the new Mumias Sugar management under managing director Nashon Aseka. He took a swipe at Jubilee leaders from the community who are are “only out to benefit themselves” while in government. “We had taken Aseka to Nzoia Sugar, but Jubilee leaders among them Senate Speaker Ken Lusaka and Water CS Eugene Wamalwa chased him away when he was appointed MD,” Wetang’ula claimed. “Ababu Namwamba can continue ‘eating meat’ in Jubilee, but he has no support at home,” Wetang’ula said. The senator said he is rallying NASA affiliated MPs to support a motion on the amendment of the reintroduction of the Sugar Development Levy.  He asked the state to stop importing sugar through dubious channels and give a chance to local companies and farmers to prosper.
