Nyamira county is a NASA zone, Governor John Nyagarama has said. Speaking on Wednesday at Sironga trading center, Nyagarama said the county will remain in NASA and ensure the opposition forms government. “As one of the counties in the resistance movement, I want to assure our NASA leaders that we will give them all our support,” Nyagrama said. He had accompanied Bogichora ward MCA-elect George Morara in celebrating his victory. Morara won Tuesday’s by-election.  Nyagarama said Kenyans are tired of the way the national government is being run.

We want to ensure our country moves in the right direction,” Nyagarama said.
