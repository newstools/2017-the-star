A 15-year-old boy in Baringo county has been arrested for attempting to write KCPE exams for a candidate. Dennis Rotich is being held at Marigat police station. He was allegedly involved in exam cheating at Kimalel Day and Boarding Primary School on Wednesday. Head teacher Kipkosiom Chepkerich said he saw the suspect enter the exam room through the window. “Investigations showed he was on a desk belonging to candidate Chemoiwo Kiprop, who was absent,” Chepkerich said. He said he notified the police manning the exam centre and they arrested Rotich. The suspect is said to be a form one student at Kapng’etuny Secondary School in Uasin Gishu county. He will be charged before the Kabarnet magistrate’s court today. Sources told the Star the school administration may have colluded with outsiders to write the exams and improve the performance index, which has been poor in previous years.
