According to Sam Ikwaye, chairman of the Kenya Association of Hotelkeepers and Caterers the performance in the coastal destination remains impressive, because of the aggressive marketing to international markets and the maturity that Kenyans demonstrated during the electioneering period. “During the period before the August elections, the Kenyan electorate demonstrated maturity in the nominations process, giving the international players confidence to go ahead and make their bookings,” he said in an interview with The Star. He said only domestic tourist numbers were affected during the August season when they expected many students to visit the coastal city. “Domestic tourism during the August school holidays was affected by the elections as many Kenyans opted not to travel for fear of political violence,” he said. He said domestic tourists have been heavily affected by the on-going political atmosphere, with less Kenyans having enough disposable income to spend on holiday packages. He however expressed optimism that Kenyans shall travel for the December holidays, as international numbers continue to register an increase in frequency. “We are noting that domestic travelers are now looking for cheaper packages, and booking less days,” he said.
