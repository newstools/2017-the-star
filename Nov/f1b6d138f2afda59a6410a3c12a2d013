Pope Francis received some
hot new wheels on Wednesday in the form of a white-and-yellow
Lamborghini but he won't be using it on the tree-shaded roads of
the Vatican gardens. The donated Lamborghini Huracan, which normally sells for
more than $200,000, was signed by the pope outside his Vatican
residence and will be auctioned by Sotheby's, with proceeds
given to the pontiff to help the needy. The Vatican said all the money would go to projects to help
Christians return to rebuild their homes in Iraq's Nineveh
Plains that were destroyed by Islamic State militants. They will also go to help female victims of human
trafficking and forced prostitution and to two Italian groups
which provide medical services in central Africa. Francis has shunned the papal limousines used by his
predecessors in favour of a simple blue Ford Focus. White and yellow are the colours of the Vatican flag.
