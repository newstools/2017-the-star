A girlfriend and childhood friend of the fallen rugby player Mike Okombe were charged with the murder in the High Court in Nakuru yesterday. Maryanne Mumbai and Calvin Okoth were charged with killing Okombe on November 4 on Olive Inn Estate in Rongai subcounty, Nakuru. Justice Maureen Odero said the two accused persons were mentally examined at Nakuru Level Five Hospital and the psychiatric report showed they were mentally fit to stand trial. Mumbi and Okoth denied the charges and through their lawyers, Kamau Chomba and Bernard Akango, sought reasonable and favourable bond terms. “We pray to the court that it grants the accused persons bond terms because I believe the prosecution has no reasons to deny them, as the evidence and witness statements have already been secured,” Kamau said. Prosecutor Amos Chigiti did not object to the application and urged the court to grant bond terms. The court ordered that they be released on Sh300,000 surety bond. The case will be heard on January 22 next year.
