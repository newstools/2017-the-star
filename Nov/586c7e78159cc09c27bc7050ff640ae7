Lugari MP Ayub Savula yesterday said former Budalang’i MP Ababu Namwamba’s attacks on NASA should be ignored. He said Namwamba is a “lost sheep” and is only out to please Jubilee so he may be appointed a Cabinet Secretary. Savula said counties in NASA strongholds are right to pass the People’s Assembly motion, it is within the law. Ten counties have approved it. “There is nothing wrong with county assemblies passing a motion that gives power to the people to decide the affairs of the country because it is within the Constitution. I wonder what law Namwamba is reading as a lawyer. Has he practiced anywhere anyway?” Savula asked. Last week, Namwamba said the Kenya Professionals’ Council will present a petition to Parliament to have the counties, which passed the motion, dissolved.     Savula Namwamba’s proposal demonstrates how JP is determined to suspend the Constitution and oppress Kenyans. Savula said that establishment of the people’s assembly was only the beginning of the return of the Bomas draft constitution.
