Governors, MPs and farmers in the Sugar industry want the privatisation of state-owned factories implemented in a manner agreeable to all stakeholders. They said farmers, who are the major shareholders, must be given priority to buy the shares before privatisation takes effect. The leaders made various resolutions aimed at revamping the companies to make them more productive and profitable during the National Sugar Industry Stakeholders forum in Kisumu on Thursday. The leaders present were governors Anyang' Nyongâ€™o (Kisumu), Okoth Obado (Migori) and Sospeter Ojaamong (Busia), Agriculture CS Willy Bett, and deputy governors Yulita Mitei (Narok) and Susan Kikwai (Kericho). The meeting was at the Grand Royal Swiss Hotel. The national and county governments in sugar-growing areas renewed their commitment to pool efforts and resources to revive the industry. The leaders proposed that sugar industry regulations be fast-tracked and gazetted upon resolution of the licensing issue raised by the Council of Governors. In the resolutions read by Obado, the participants proposed the reestablishment of a cane development fund; promotion of research on crop varieties; commercialisation of seed cane production; and debt waivers for state-owned milling companies in preparation for privatisation. Others are ending illegal importation and illegal packaging of sugar; introduction of zoning and lock farming; review of construction and operations of weighbridges; and restoration of extension services. Obado said there is need for investment in transport infrastructure in the sugar-growing areas with the possibility of introducing light rails.
