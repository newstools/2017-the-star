The hearing of a petition challenging the election of Laikipia
Governor Ndiritu Muriithi has been adjourned to Wednesday next week, when he
is expected to testify as the last witness. The hearing was adjourned after the parties agreed there was no enough time to cross examine the governor, who was scheduled to take
to the witness stand after county returning officer Agnes Mutisya. At the start of the hearing on Friday morning, justice
Mary Kasango told the parties the court would end this week’s sitting at
1pm. It had sat for three days since Wednesday. Among the witnesses who have testified are petitioner Sammy Ndung’u, who alleged malpractices occurred at
several polling centeres, including opening some stations late and closing before
the stipulated time of 5pm. Other anomalies he cited included wrong entry of
voting results. The petitioner’s lawyer Ramadhan Abubakar had tabled a 400
page document highlighting a number of malpractices, including failure by party
agents and presiding officers to sign results declaration forms. Mutisya told the court unavoidable circumstances such as flooding  experienced on the polling day — August 8 — resulted in some polling centres
opening late, especially in Laikipia North constituency. Click here for the latest political news
