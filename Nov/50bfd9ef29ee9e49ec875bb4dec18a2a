Cooperative Bank return to the Kenya Volleyball Federation play-offs set for December 1-3 at Makande Hall, Mombasa County after two years absence. The bankers’ coach Geoffrey Omondi attributed their return to hard work and consistence. Cooperative finished the regular season, which ended last Friday in Eldama Ravine, in position three with 27 points having won nine matches and lost three. Omondi was, however, quick to note that the play-offs will not be a walk in park bearing in mind their opponents are regular participants at that stage. “We have been out of the play-offs for two years and we are glad we are making a comeback this year. Ours has been work in progress but at the end of the day, consistence and hard work from players have paid off,” said the former national coach, now KVF coaches commission chairman. “The regular season has been competitive and all the teams who have qualified are there by merit and therefore it will be interesting to see how all this will end but we will be out to make a good account of ourselves.” The bankers start their 2017 title quest against Kenya Prisons on December 1, take on KPA on December 2 before they wrap up the three day event with a tie against GSU. Omondi noted: “Prisons is a good side and have been regulars in the event. We know how they play and we hope to ruffle a few feathers and put on a good show.” Other team that have booked their places in the play-offs include 2015 champions General Service Unit, who completed the regular season unbeaten with 34 points, champions Kenya Prisons with 31 points having won 11 matches and lost one. Hosts Kenya Ports Authority complete the top four with 25 points. The Porters held their nerve to see off their nearest rivals, Kenya Defence Forces 3-2 to seal the final slot having won eight and lost four matches.
