The county government is facing a financial crisis, as it ended the last financial year Sh11 billion in debt. In the first financial quarter, it collected only 7.5 per cent or Sh1.4 billion, of its targetted revenue of Sh19.7 billion by September 30. The dismal financial state was detailed in a report by the county Treasury. Failure to automate all the streams, corrupt officers and leaks have been blamed for the dismal performance. Nairobi has 136 revenue streams but only 14 key streams have been automated to increase collections. In the last financial year ending June 30, City Hall had a deficit of Sh11 billion due low revenue collections. The report says City Hall received Sh4 billion from the national government. This included Sh3.7 billion equitable share, Sh330 million for free maternity and Sh394 million for road maintenance levy. The county has spent Sh4.5 billion, or 19.7 per cent of the Sh24.1 billion recurrent expenditure budget. This compares to Sh24.5 million or 0.2 per cent of the Sh11.7 billion development allocation. Revenue sources include parking fees, single business permits, building permits and billboards and advertisements. Governor Mike Sonko has pledged to establish measures to increase collections. He has instructed WebTribe, the company contracted, to automate all the streams. ICT and E-government executive Charles Kerich said during vetting t he would contract another company to assist in revenue collection. “JamboPay (run by WebTribe) is a good initiative, but they were only in charge of 14 revenue streams. With the automation of all the streams, I am not sure it can handle all of them,” Kerich said.
