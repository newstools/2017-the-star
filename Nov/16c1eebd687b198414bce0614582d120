Legendary Genge star Jua Cali has managed to keep his family away from the glaring eyes of the media. For over a decade now, the Kiasi hit maker has showcased his talent and street personality but kept his wife and kids from the limelight.  He and his wife, Lilly Asigo, are now expecting baby number three, a girl, after a successful baby shower last weekend, which was only graced by close friends and family.  So, what does it take to keep the family off the public eye? "Family plays a big role to make sure I'm good," Jua Cali said. Talking to Kiss TV's Angeline Wanjeri and DJ Kim, the Kamata Dame hit maker added: "The secret ni kumake sure unamek ngoma poa, ndio relationship yako na mafans inakua poa ndio they won't ask you about your personal life. On the other hand, I like my family on their own lane not being disturbed by people. Nikiget chance ya kuwashow off, ninawashow off." His supportive wife has been his make-up artiste for some of his latest videos, including Safsana and Vile Naskia featuring Wyre.
