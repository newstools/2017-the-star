The NGO Coordination Board has launched a new crackdown on
civil society groups. Among those summoned to appear before the Board’s CEO,
Fazul Mahamed, is the Inuka Kenya boss John Githongo and Katiba Institute’s
Prof Yash Pal Ghai. This is not the first time the Board has cracked down on
NGOs, it did so after the August 8 General Election and before the Supreme
Court annulled the presidential results.  After the Supreme Court’s judgment, President Kenyatta vowed
he would deal with the Judiciary at a later date. Jubilee has made amendments
to the Election Laws Act, making it harder to annul another presidential
election. There will be a new petition filed today. We are urging the politicians to allow the Supreme Court to
hear the petition without undue influence or intimidation.  The shooting of Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu’s
bodyguard and the lack of quorum in the Supreme Court were regrettable events. The Supreme Court needs to redeem its image and provide jurisprudential
leadership in this convoluted atmosphere.
