Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong’ has announced measures to clear all pending bills and increase development spending. Addressing the press in Nambale on Thursday, Ojaamong’ said there will be no new project executed by his government in the financial year 2017-2018. “ It is unfortunate my government inherited millions of shillings in debts and pending bills. That is why we have scaled up development expenditure. We shall raise it to 50 per cent in the next financial year,” he said. He said he would limit foreign and local travels to reduce expenditure.
