Residents of Kiongwe, Kitui, heaved with a sigh of relieve after toxic asbestos substance that was dumped in the area early this year was removed. Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu intervened in October after residents complained about the toxic waste. Kiongwe hill is a water catchment for Thua River last March. The river serves thousands of residents. Environment executive John Makau said Sh5.5 million was used to scooped out the asbestos and store it in two secure containers. There is a dilemma over where to dump the hazardous substance.  On Saturday, the residents told the Star they are pleased Governor Ngilu and their MP Nimrod Mbai had acted fast.
