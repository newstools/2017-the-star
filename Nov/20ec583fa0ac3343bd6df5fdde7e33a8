 The Artists for Refugees Annual Gala was held at Alliance Francaise, Nairobi. The scheduled events included the screening of short videos on the Artists for Refugees Project, musical performances by refugees, exhibition and sale of art by visual artists mentored under the project and an interactive session with various refugee artists. Over the years, UNHCR Kenya has collaborated with visual artists and musicians in its efforts to create public awareness around refugee issues. Artists for Refugees is a livelihoods project that aims to empower refugees through art, music and sports. This initiative also seeks to provide refugees with a voice, while positively influencing public opinion towards refugees. UNHCR launched the Artists for Refugees Project in 2015, as an avenue to promote and nurture talent in various fields of art, and as a potential avenue towards self-reliance for skilled refugee artists. This event will showcase the remarkable achievements made thus far, including artwork and musical performances.
