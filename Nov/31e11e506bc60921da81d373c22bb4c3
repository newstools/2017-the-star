Fifty-five girls from Kuria have been rescued from Female Genital Mutilation which was scheduled to take place in Tanzania. Activists who rescued the girls said they headed for Tanzania
to perform the cruel cutting after the exercise was shunned in Kenya. All the girls were from Kuria East subcounty. They were all aged between 8 and 12. They were rescued at Gesonso center on diverse dates as they tried to sneak across the border. On
Monday, the activists organised a ceremony to celebrate the rescue and build awareness against FGM. Female rights activist Susan
Matinde said the plan to have the girls circumcised in Tanzania was organised by their parents. “FGM is always performed from November through to December and some parents have capitalised
on the laxity of police to have cut it done in secret," Matinde said.
