Pope Francis has mourned the death of Bishop Cornelius Korir as a great loss to the church and said he stands with Kenyans “in this time of sorrow”. He was a renowned peacemaker who also spoke truth to power during the Kanu years. The Pope expressed deep sadness at the cleric’s demise. Korir, 67, died on Monday, having suffered from diabetes and high blood pressure. “We have received the message of condolence from Pope Francis following the death of Bishop Korir,” Father William Kosgey, Vicar General of the Eldoret Diocese, said on Friday. More than 100,000 mourners are expected to be in Eldoret on November 10 to attend special prayers, a night vigil and a funeral service at the Eldoret Sports Club before burial on November 11 at the Sacred Heart Cathedral, Eldoret. The government will cover part of the cost for the funeral. Already, the state is installing floodlights at the Sacred Heart Cathedral and the bishop’s Elgon View residence, where local and international guests are expected ahead of the burial. President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto have directed that the government be directly involved in preparations for the burial. “We will do anything the church asks as we assist in giving Bishop Korir a befitting sendoff, as directed by President Kenyatta,” Energy CS Charles Keter said during a special mass in Eldoret on Thursday. Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago said the county will clear the expenses that will be incurred at the Sports Club, where a funeral service will be held. “As counties in the North Rift, we are the greatest beneficiaries of Bishop Korir’s peace work. We’ll spare a day to come for prayers at the cathedral before his burial,” he said. Uasin Gishu county commissioner Abdi Hassan and security teams toured the church compound yesterday. The body will be moved to the Sacred Heart Cathedral at 1pm for public viewing on the eve of burial. A funeral mass will follow at 3pm, and then a night vigil.
