A controversial recommendation by FKF
president Nick Mwenda to increase his four-year term in office from two
to three has been dropped. But
the new Football Kenya Federation constitution passed on Saturday at the AGM still ensures Mwendwa can hold power for up
to 12 years. The new constitution states a mandatory two-term limit will take effect after 2020 election. This means should Mwendwa wins the upcoming poll, he will still be eligible to run again in 2024.  Mwendwa
said the extension of the president’s term would align the FKF
constitution to that of the Confederation of African Football and Fifa. "If
it is not passed now,  FIFA will not allow any change in the
constitution come 2018. Anything electoral will take effect in 2020," he
said on Saturday. The proposal has met vicious protest. The Sports
Act stipulates that all officials of any national sports must not stay in
office beyond the statutory two-term limit of four years each. The passed constitution states there will be 290 electoral areas. "The presidential candidates in future will come with a running mate," he said. In the previous statue, deputy presidents were voted separately. Some 77 teams from the Sportpesa Premiere League, National Super League, Division One and Women League were represented. Dissenting voices claimed the president angled at enriching himself by prolonging stay.
