Former Mwingi Central MP Joe Mutambu has filed for bankruptcy
through his company United Credit Limited. Mutambo's lawyers Wadumbo and Company
presented the application in a gazette notice on July 25. The Commercial and Admiralty Division of the High Court has said the matter will be heard on December 6. 
"Anyone
opposed or supporting the application is required to appear before
during the hearing either personally or through an attorney." The former Wiper leader defected to Jubilee but lost his seat losing to Wiper's Gideon Mulyungi in the August 8 poll. The one-term legislator shot to the limelight in September 2015 when Bishop Thomas Wahome of Helicopter Church accused him of assault. Wahome claimed Mutambu locked him up in an office along Ngong Road where he had gone to reclaim a lorry he had hired out to the legislator. He claimed the ex-legislator detained him for more than seven hours after threatening him with a gun. Earlier in February that year, he had also been charged with assaulting and squeezing the private parts of Kitui Governor Julius Malombe's political adviser.  The prosecution accused Mutambu of willfully and unlawfully assaulting Charles Kyale thereby occasioning him actual bodily harm. He denied the charge before Kibera principal magistrate Bernard Ochoi.  Read: MP Mutambu charged with stealing bishop Wahome's lorry
