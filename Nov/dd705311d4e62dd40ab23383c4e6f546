Airtel registered a Sh9.5 billion ($92 million) profit before tax from its 15 African operations for the period ended September 30. This saw the telco recover from a Sh2 billion loss ($20 million) recorded over a similar period last year. For the period, revenues grew by 3 per cent to reach Sh83.8 billion ($809m), from Sh81.9 billion ($790m), attributed to increased data and Airtel Money usage. During the quarter, the company had an aggregate customer base of 81.9 million as compared to 78.1 million in the corresponding quarter last year, an increase of 4.8 per cent. Data customers now represent 26.5 per cent of the total customer base, as compared to 23.1 per cent in the corresponding quarter last year. Data customers during the quarter increased by 20.1 per cent to 21.7 million as compared to 18.1 million in the corresponding quarter last year. The total customer base using the Airtel Money platform increased by 3.5 per cent to 9.5 million as compared to 9.1 million in the corresponding quarter last year. "Our focus on acquiring quality customers has resulted in a lower customer churn for the quarter at 4.9 per cent as compared to 5.3 per cent in the corresponding quarter last year," the statement said. Though silent on specific countriesâ€™ performances like Kenya, a financial statement posted on the global website indicated the company is scaling down its operations in the continent. The number of employees, for instance, has dropped from 4,058 to 3,737, an 8 per cent drop.
