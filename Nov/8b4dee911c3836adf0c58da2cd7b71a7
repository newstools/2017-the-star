Morticians are up in arms over a proposal by Ntsa to have those found guilty of drunk
driving work as mortuary attendants as punishment. Chairman of the National Funeral Services Association of
Kenya Ezra Olack yesterday condemned the proposal. Olack told the National Transport and Safety Authority to respect
their profession.  “Stop demeaning our profession. The work we do is very important.
We have a code of ethics and code of conduct that all our staff have to abide by,” Olack told the Star in a
phone interview.  The Ntsa is in the process of formulating a policy that
will see drunk drivers work in mortuaries. Data from the authority shows that 2,496 died between January and November 19 as a result of road crashes. Majority of them were pedestrians, who account for 941 deaths.  Olack said Ntsa should instead consider
increasing the penalties as opposed to subjecting drivers to serving as morgue
attendants against their will.   “We are not going to allow
people to come and ruin our profession. I'm sure that the person who
made the proposal was joking," Olack said. He said drivers can sue Ntsa for being forced to work in mortuaries.   Those found driving under the influence of alcohol are usually charged under the Traffic Act. They pay a fine of between Sh20,000-Sh30,000. Olack said morticians are often stigmatised yet they are also professionals. “People think that mortuary attendants are society rejects
and drug addicts. They don't know that we also go to school and learn how to take care of dead bodies,”
Olack said. Morticians receive bodies in funeral homes, preserve and
prepare them for burial or cremation.    “One has to be trained on how to do all these procedures,” Olack said The organisation now wants Parliament to make laws that can help streamline the funeral sector.  They want morticians trained, funeral homes regulated and standards on hearses created.
