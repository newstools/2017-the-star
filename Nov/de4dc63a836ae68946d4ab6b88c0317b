Leaders from Northeastern have cautioned their Coast counterparts against pushing for secession, saying they  tried to break away and failed, with grave consequences. Mombasa Governor Ali Joho, Kilifi’s Amason Kingi and 18 others on Friday announced they will start the process of breaking away from Kenya so the Coast can attain self–rule. They said the region has been marginalised by successive administrations since Independence. Speaking to the Star separately, former Dujis MP Hussein Maalim and Kenya Livestock Association vice chairman Dubat Amey said seceding will be catastrophic. Between 1963 and 1967,  a separatists movement called the Northern Frontier District Liberation Army   fought a bloody four-year war for secession and to join Somalia, which led to brutal suppression. Some attribute the region’s marginalisation to the Shifta War. “Kenya is one entity. The country is already polarised more than ever before. Such talk will only divide the country further,” Maalim said. Amey called for an end to the calls for secession. He said devolution can address the disparities cited by the coastal leaders. Maalim, who served as a Cabinet minister for 20 years in President Moi’s government, said it is high timePresident-elect Uhuru Kenyatta and NASA leader Raila Odinga held talks. “I think the two parties should sit down and agree to change the 2010 Constitution. The presidential system should be changed to a parliamentary system like India’s,” he said. “We were the first people to ask for secession, hence know the cost. It is very dangerous and very costly. The leaders agitating for this are blinded by the comfortable lives they lead.”
