Gor Mahia right-back Karim Nizigiyimana has been ruled out for three months after undergoing a surgery for an injury sustained in their match against Mathare United in October.  The Burundian was stretchered off after 14 minutes and after scans, the right back was found to have torn his Achilles. Nizigiyimana successfully underwent surgery for the career wrecking injury and according to his employers, he is expected to be discharged today. In his absence, the club is likely to rely on Joash Onyango in the remaining Premier League match against Sony Sugar. The right back, who has eleven caps with his national team, will miss the upcoming Cecafa Senior Challenge where his knowledge of the Kenyan football and the state of the pitches will be dearly missed by The Swallows. Gor Mahia confirmed the length of the layoff and his expected return date to action and wished him speedy recovery.  “Defender Karim Nizigiyimana got injured during the disastrous tie against Mathare United (mid October) in Thika where he played for just 14 minutes before being stretchered off the pitch.  “ He needed a good medical attention and the scans and check-ups revealed that the player had a torn Achilles tendon on his right foot and needed a surgery lest the injury marks the ‘end’ of his football career.  “With the help of the club, Karim was admitted in one of the hospitals in Nairobi and had a successful surgery,” according to club’s official website.
