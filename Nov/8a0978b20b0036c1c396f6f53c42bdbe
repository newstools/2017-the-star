Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has nominated Peter Kariuki as the county secretary.  Sonko nominated Kariuki on Tuesday and sent the name to the county assembly for vetting. If approved by the House, Kariuki will take over from Leboo Ole Morintat who is currently holding the position in an acting capacity.  The nominee currently works at the project delivery unit in the Office of the President.  Leboo succeeded Robert Ayisi who left office in August over health problems.  Ayisi was the second county secretary after Lilian Ndegwa who was hounded out of office in 2015 over corruption claims.  She was charged, alongside other county officials, with defrauding the county of Sh17 million. Â
