Sports, Culture and
Arts CS Hassan Wario has asked Kenyans to invest more in cultural tourism. He said the cultural aspect of tourism had
been long-forgotten as people focus more on other forms of tourism. Wario spoke on Sunday at the just-concluded 17th edition of the Lamu Cultural Festival in Lamu Old Town The festival ran from November
16 and ended on 19. This year’s event
attracted more domestic tourists than foreign ones. Wario
urged Kenyans to emulate countries like Nigeria and the USA that have dedicated
efforts towards preserving their cultures and incorporated
them in their movies. The CS said he was
impressed by the large turnout of domestic tourists for the festival, a move he
attributed to the improved security.  “The fact that many
domestic tourists turned up this year is impressive. People, especially the
youth, should strive to preserve their cultures. Culture is crucial for the
country’s economic growth,” Wario said. The Lamu Cultural Festival is an annual event to showcase the rich culture and heritage of Lamu’s Swahili people.  Lamu Cultural Festival Promotional Group secretary general Faisal Miji said this
year’s event was unique because it attracted a huge
number of domestic tourists than ever, since its inception back in 2001. Previous festivals have had the island flooding with foreign
tourists, but this year was the exact opposite.  “This is
proof that Lamu is peaceful,” Miji said. The majority of those who reaped from this year’s festival are
hoteliers, boat operators, fishermen and small-scale traders. Boat operators and fishermen on the Island said they made huge profits in the four days of the festival, compared
to what they would have made for a whole month. The
festival was attended by politicians from other counties, including Mandera woman representative Amina Ahmed, her Isiolo counterpart Rehema Jardesa and MPs Abdikarim Osman (Fafi) and Sophia Noor (Ijara).
