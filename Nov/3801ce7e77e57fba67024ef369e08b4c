Eight years after 29 people were burned to death in a fire at Nakumatt Downtown, an inquest is yet to conclude hearings due to frequent adjournments. On Monday, the inquest was postponed to December 8. Read: Nakumatt Downtown fire probe yet to conclude, seven years on Milimani chief magistrate Francis Andayi put off the case after Lawyer M Musyoki for Nakumatt failed to appear in court. The court was informed the lawyer was engaged in another matter at the Supreme Court. Senior state counsel Solomon Naulikha told the court that investigating officer Emmanuel Ng'etich was ready with three witnesses, among them a pathologist. The 29, including five Nakumatt staff, died on January 28, 2009 in the fire that reportedly resulted from the explosion of gas cylinders. After investigations led by detective Ngetich of the Nairobi Area CID, a public inquest at a court was recommended. Danson Kimathi, a senior officer from the electrical engineering department in the former Ministry of Public Works, has given his full testimony. In his report, Kimathi said the fire may have originated from fuel vapours or gas coming in contact with the hot exhaust pipe of the generator, or sparks from contact during a change from DC to AC. Earlier, the court heard that at about 2.30pm on that day, smoke was seen emanating from the generator room on the ground floor, near the stairs that ld to the mezzanine floor. The bodies of the 29 were found in debris, up the stairs of the mezzanine floor.
