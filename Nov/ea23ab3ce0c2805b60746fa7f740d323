Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) jet out this morning for Luanda, Angola for the Fiba women’s Africa Champions Cup. The 10-day tournament is scheduled to tip off late this afternoon in the Angolan capital, where Africa’s 12 top sides will battle it out for honours. The winners will book a ticket to the World Championships next year. Also representing the country are reigning national champions Equity Bank who left yesterday morning. While the porters will be making yet another appearance in the event, the bankers are making their debut. Team manager Christopher Ogutu yesterday confirmed the team arrangement, saying they will go flat out for another stab at the continental honours that has always eluded them. KPA finished seventh in the 10 team show in Mozambique last year. Mercy Wanyama, who starred for KPA in last year’s spectacle in Maputo, will turn out for Equity Bank and so will Belinda Okoth. Felmas Adhiambo, Betty Kananu and Selina Okoth will be the ports women’s key players. Inter Clube of Angola are the defending champions although Ferroviario de Maputo from Mozambique are hotly favoured to bag their first trophy after dominating the Zone six qualifiers in Botswana, where they went unbeaten.  The Mozambicans are banking on former United States International University (SIU) star forward Sarah Chan. Other teams to beat are Primero de Agosto of Angola and First Bank of Nigeria. Chan is playing for a serious title contender. “In my basketball career, all I have left on my bucket list is two things to accomplish and I can happily retire. First, I want to win the women’s Africa Club Championship and play for my national team - South Sudan,” Chan told Fiba. She guided her new team during last week’s Zone six qualifiers in Botswana. They humbled the reigning African champions Inter Clube and Primeiro de Agosto, both from Angola.
