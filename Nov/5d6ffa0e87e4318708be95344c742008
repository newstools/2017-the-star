Police are searching for three girls who escaped from Murang’a juvenile remand home over the weekend. The three, aged between 13 and 17, escaped from the facility in Murang’a town on Saturday night. Murang’a North OCPD Johnston Limo said the girls cut window grills to escape. They all had pending court cases. One girl is from Murang’a county, while the other two are from Kirinyaga county. Limo asked the public to provide information leading to the re-arrest of the trio. Murang’a county children’s coordinator Rhoda Mwicha said the break-out was immediately reported to police after they realised the girls were missing.  Officers at the facility had initially barred journalists and refused to let them take pictures of the window grill that the girls had cut. One girl’s father said he first learned about the escape when police stormed his home in search of her daughter. “Four officers came to my home on Sunday morning and informed me that my daughter had disappeared from prison,” he told the Star. He asked how the minors managed to escape from the well-guarded facility. He said his daughter was facing charges of theft and indiscipline. “We thought her brief stay at the prison would help her reform,” he said. The father said her daughter, the youngest of five children, is three months’ pregnant. The girl is a form two student, her father said. “She has been doing well in academics. I hope she is found soon,” he said.
