In a daring heist, ingenious thieves drilled a tunnel from a sewer line near the KCB Thika Branch, entered the strongroom and stole Sh50 million. The bank’s manager, Samuel Ng’ang’a, discovered the heist yesterday when he opened the strongroom at 10am. He said customers’ funds were safe. A source who requested anonymity said the thieves dug a 50-meter tunnel from the sewer line through adjacent business premises, including an M-Pesa shop.  At midday the bank was cordoned off by police officers led by Thika OCPD Willy Simba and OCS Michael Paul Onyita.  Onyita told the Star to wait for the bank anti-fraud unit and detectives to complete investigations for a comprehensive report.  According to police reports, the gang broke into two safes and are believed to have used an oxy-acytelene torch to open the safes.  Police are working to establish when exactly the robbery took place.  In a statement, KCB confirmed that the break-in had been discovered yesterday morning.
