Impala fly-half Nato Simiyu returns to the Simbas line-up after a year’s absence as head coach Jerome Paarwater named the 26-man traveling party to the Hong Kong Cup of Nations set for between November 10 and 18. Simiyu’s last taste of test rugby was the 34-10 home win over Hong Kong in Nairobi in August last year. Simiyu replaces the axed Isaac Adimo. There is also a return for fellow fly-half Biko Adema who limped off injured during the Simbas 19-19 draw against the same opposition in Nairobi on August 20 this year. Alex Olaba, Peter Kilonzo and Elkeans Musonye also got the nod for their first tour and with it the opportunity to add to their solitary caps. The Simbas start their campaign with a clash against Chile on November 10 before playing Russia on November 14. They will complete their fixtures against hosts Hong Kong on November 18.
