The Reimagined series is the brainchild of Nairobi-based journalist and storyteller Maimouna Jallow.  Drawing on age-old African traditions of oral storytelling, the show focuses on adapting African novels into live performances with the aim of creating more platforms for African stories. Maimouna hopes that this will in turn revive oral storytelling and nurture a reading culture. After touring for two years around the world, including Uganda, Ghana, Egypt, Scotland and Sweden, the show returns to its roots in Nairobi with a final showcasing on November 30. Set to take place at The Alchemist Bar, the event, which starts from 8pm, will feature performances by Maimouna herself alongside June Gachui and Neno Kali. Previous performers include Sitawa Namwalie, Mumbi Kaigwa, Raya Wambui, Patricia Kihoro, Rehema Nanfuka and Aleya Kassam. This final installation will feature three stories. The Secret Lives of Baba Segi’s Wives is described as an endearing and powerful tale of deception, betrayal, love and friendship. The narrative explores the name character’s life as he struggles to discover the reason behind his fourth wife’s infertility. The story shows the pressure placed on women by the society and the cunning ways they have learnt to escape patriarchy and poverty. Maid in SA is a tongue-in-cheek look at the relationship between a South African maid and their employers. Can We Talk, on the other hand, delves into a man who has finally come to be fed up by societal expectations, particularly where marriage is concerned. Entry is Sh600.
