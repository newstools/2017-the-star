Late on a rainy afternoon, I approached the main gate to exit the park. The usual large troop of Olive baboons were congregated there, occupying various areas that included blocking the road.  A group of baby baboons caught my eye as they began to play. Suddenly, a slightly older youngster decided to grab a piece of a stick and challenge all the other baby baboons to play “catch me if you can”.  Obviously, the slightly older youngster ran rings around the wobbly legged newborn babies. But what impressed me, and was also interesting, was that the babies all tried to actually catch him with their undeveloped bodies. One baby baboon seemingly “jumped for joy” in excited frustration, as the older youngster victoriously ran past him with the stick and sat in the road, biting his “victory prize stick”.  I believe this type of “game activity”, while occupying their day as seemingly having fun, is actually a vital part of their rapid physical  development that they all need in the wild to ensure they can respond to danger situations. This particular place is a high-traffic zone for many vehicles entering and exiting the park.  Most people do not really spend much time watching the Olive baboon troop at the main gate. They just stop for a moment and then drive away. Baboons are very intelligent and clearly understand that the park main gate area is safer, to avoid  predators such as leopards in the park. They have a very thick furry coat, and it is well worth the time to sit and watch a troop interact.  Baboon antics are also particularly interesting to humans because many of their habit traits are almost “human like” and, therefore, are often funny.
