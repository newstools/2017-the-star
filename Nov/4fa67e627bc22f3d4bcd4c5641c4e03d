A 73-year-old retired teacher has filed a petition in a Kangema court to end her marriage to her 76-year-old husband, citing his ‘neglect of matrimonial duties’. Marcella Mukami from Kiru location in Mathioya constituency said Peter Kinyugo, her husband of 55 years, abandoned her after marrying a second wife. Mukami accused Kinyugo, a retired chief, of neglecting her family since 1984, when he married Triza Mulinge. “The problems in our marriage were aggravated six years ago when my husband started spending weeks at my co-wife’s home without paying me a visit,” Mukami told the court on Thursday. She said when Kinyugo married a second wife, he moved her into a house they had converted into a cow pen. Mukami and Kinyugo have one child. Kinyugo has three children with Mulinge.  Senior resident magistrate Dennis Kivuti adjourned the hearing after Mukami protested the production of her family photographs and NHIF documents contrary to the laid down procedures. The magistrate scheduled the case for hearing on January 18 to give time to the two parties to exchange their details and documents to allow the suit to proceed. Kinyugo had asked the court to allow the case to proceed, saying he produced the photographs to remind her of the family activities both Mukami and Mulinge were involved in. But Mukami’s lawyer Margaret Nyang’ati objected the production of the documents in court, saying her husband was ambushing her instead of following the legal procedure.  Mukami, who uses a wheelchair, was taken to the court from Huruma Hospital in Nanyuki where she is admitted.
