The Beth Mugo Foundation has partnered with Visions of Hope Africa to train oncologists across the country in the next two years. The training will be conducted by medics from the US. Oncologists will offer free cancer screening. “This is meant to combat the high number of cancer cases and reduce the cancer burden in the country,”  nominated senator and foundation executive director, Beth Mugo, said yesterday. Kenya only has 12 oncologists. This has forced many patients to seek treatment overseas, especially India. Those unable to foot the costs are left stranded. Data from the National Cancer Registry shows 28,000 people die annually because of cancer.
