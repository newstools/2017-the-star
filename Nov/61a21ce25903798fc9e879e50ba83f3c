Ahadi Kenya Trust Foundation has raised concern over the increase in spread of jiggers following the political stalemate since the August 8 election. Ambassador Cecilia Mwangi yesterday said they have been unable to help jigger victims in some parts of the country due to political uncertainty. She spoke in Ganze, Kilifi, during an anti-jigger campaign conducted in partnership with Imarika Sacco Foundation. Mwangi urged Kenyans to embrace cohesion and stop ethnic profiling. She said areas worst hit by jiggers are inaccessible. “We would like Kenyans to live in peace. The political season is over,” Mwangi said. She said the political stalemate has also affected the economy. Mwangi was with Miss Tourism Kilifi county Meagan Wallace who said she was honoured to take part in the campaign. Imarika Sacco Foundation chairman Renson Ndoro said their partnership with Ahadi has enabled them reach out to many people affected by jiggers. In Ganze alone, they helped more than 600 people, the majority children affected by jiggers. He said their aim is to reach out to people affected, treat and empower them.
