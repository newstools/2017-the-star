Retired Senator Zipporah Kittony yesterday urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to take charge of Kenya's progress, following his reelection on Thursday. "We want the country to move forward and he should steer Kenya now," she said. "Kenyans have shown him their support and he should now unite the country for our collective prosperity." Kittony spoke to the Star on the phone. "Even the air yesterday was bad, but today you can feel a difference and everything is going to be better now," she said. "We are happy he got all those genuine votes. Even if they were less than what he got in August, it is proof he was overwhelmingly elected in the first election. The former politician said the prolonged election period had taken a toll on all Kenyans and it would be important for politics to be put in the back burner for at least five years.
