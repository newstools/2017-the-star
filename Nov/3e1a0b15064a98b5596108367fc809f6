A bid that seeks to affirm the legitimacy of President Uhuru Kenyatta’s election has been filed at the Supreme Court. The case filed yesterday also seeks to declare NASA’s boycott of the repeat presidential election as unlawful. It has been filed by Pokot South MP David Pkosing, who was told by the High Court last week that the issues can only be adjudicated by the apex court. The MP, through lawyer Kibe Mungai, wants the court to answer the question as to whether a fully or partially successful sabotage, subversion or impediment of a presidential election can affect the legality, legitimacy or validity of a presidential election. He argues NASA’s sabotage of the repeat polls held on October 26 was treasonous and a political scheme meant to establish a government without complying with the Constitution. Pkosing said the court should hold that Uhuru was lawfully elected in accordance with the order of the Supreme Court made on September 1. “Notwithstanding, the boycott by NASA leaders and obstruction of the fresh presidential election by their supporters in some regions, the polls constitute a lawful basis to establish a government,” he said. Pkosing argues all candidates nominated to contest the fresh presidential election were bound by the order of the Supreme Court to participate in the election. “No person is entitled to benefit or gain advantage under Article 138 of the Constitution from the partially successful boycott, subversion and sabotage of the fresh presidential election that culminated in no election in 25 out of Kenya’s 290 Constituencies” he said. According to him, the boycott amounts to gross contempt of the Constitution.
