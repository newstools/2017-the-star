Environmental activists have threatened unspecified action against incoming Mombasa executive for environment Godfrey Nyongesa if he does not clear heaps of garbage strewn all over the town in 30 days. Heavy rains have heightened fears of disease outbreaks after flash floods swept garbage to homes in estates. Environmental activists want Nyongesa to urgently deal with the matter.  Nyongesa is among the 10 new county executives set to be sworn in today. Active Environmental Team yesterday told the Star the county has been ineffective in waste management. “We are giving Nyongesa 30 days to deal with the garbage problem, failure which we shall take action against him,” the NGO’s coordinator Benson Wemali said. Ganjoni residents yesterday demanded that the county immediately clears a mountain of garbage next to the office of the woman representative. Food vendor Mercy Kurera told reporters she has lost clients because of a foul smell from the illegal dumpsite. “Business has never been as bad as now for the seven months I have been here. Clients say they cannot eat next to such a stinking heap of garbage,” Kurera said. Hotelier and political activists Mama Jawambe said business can only thrive in a clean environment. “We are losing out because clients are already looking for alternative eateries,” Jawambe said. Kurera’s client Fred Osoro asked Governor Hassan Joho to urgently intervene and ensure the town’s hygiene improves. “We are demanding services from the county because we pay taxes. It is our right to live in a clean environment,” Osoro said. Wemali asked the county to provide designated dumpsites and create awareness.  “They tried using collection trucks but that has failed to solve the problem,” Wemali said.
