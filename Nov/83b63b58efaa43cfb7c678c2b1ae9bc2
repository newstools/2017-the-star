Kenyans are likely to pay more for sugar during the December festive season as millers operate below 50 per cent of their grinding capacity due to a sugarcane shortage. Ten millers have had low production, with some already closing down for weeks, while others operate part-time. Sony Sugar acting managing director Bernard Otieno said the miller is operating at 40 per cent capacity because of the shortage, which was made worse by the General Election fever. During the period, there have been frequent demonstrations involving the blocking of roads, which affect transportation. “We are currently operating only four days a week, which is better than most millers, who only operate twice a week, while others have closed shop completely,” Otieno said. Speaking to the Star on Thursday, he said the deficit has partly been caused by the removal of the Sugar Development Levy Fund by the government. It was used by millers in cane production. “Currently, millers, especially government-owned ones, have been forced to dip into their merger income to develop cane, despite making losses,” Otieno said. He said the only millers who are currently producing their own sugar are Trans Mara, Sony, Nzoia and Chemelil, with the rest “importing sugar which they pack and label as their own”. According to government data, the country’s millers can only produce 60,000 metric tonnes of table sugar in a month against the requirement of 65,000 metric tonnes in a moth with the deficit being imported in bulk. “Despite that what we can currently produce in the country is about 20,000 metric tonnes of sugar, which calls for the deficit to be imported,” Otieno said.
