Two Machakos MPs have said they will sue the National Police Service and IG Joseph Boinnet following the killings of NASA supporters in Mavoko. They said the police must be held to account following the death of "innocent" civilians who only opposed the October 26 repeat presidential election. Mavoko MP Patrick Makau and Machakos woman rep Joyce Kamene said this during the burial of one of the victims on Friday.  Joseph Kaloki, 15, who was shot dead at Jua Kali slum in Athi River town was laid to rest at their home in Mulau village in Mwala,
Machakos county. The legislators promised to file a case in court to seek
justice for the victims. They did not specify the timeliness for the same. They said governments across the world should
protect their citizens but not kill them. "It is painful to bury a 15-year- old boy
who only obeyed his mother who had sent him to a shop," Kamene said. Makau accused the Jubilee administration of
abetting atrocities against citizens saying it must be held responsible. He said those behind the deaths and maiming
of two other residents during the protests must be held to account. Makau said he will be at forefront in presenting
the case in bid
of seeking justice for the victims and their families. NASA lawyer James Orengo during a rally in Machakos on October 29, said he will litigate for NASA supporters injured or killed during anti-election protests. "I
will present in court all victims of the shootings in Machakos county. I
am going to personally file a case against the IG and he Athi River
OCS." He addressed NASA supporters shortly after
visiting two victims at Athi River Medical Services Hospital in Mavoko
sub-county. Read: Orengo threatens to sue Boinnet, Athi OCS over Mavoko shootings
