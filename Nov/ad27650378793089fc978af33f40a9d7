Kenya Simbas coach Jerome Paarwater yesterday said they will use their poor show in the Four Nations tournament to their advanatge ahead of next year’s World Cup qualifiers. Simbas lost 31-10 to Russia in their second game of the tournament on Tuesday to bow out of contention. Paarwater saiod they will use the event to correct their mistakes ahead of the global qualifiers.  Paarwater defended the players, saying they had put up a good show against Russia. “ I am now confident. They played a tough game and never disappointed. Now they must maintain their standards going forward,” he said. He observed that the tournament was eye opener not only for the players but also the management. “This competition has high standards and if we look at it in terms of preparation, it is good for us in terms of where we want to go,” he noted.  He added that the scoreline (31-10) did not reflect the game. “The scoreline doesn’t reflect the actual match. We had a lot of opportunities in the first half that we didn’t use…too many 50-50 passes. We re-grouped in the second half and scored a great try..and after doing a video review of the game, we discovered we had the opportunity to score five more tries.It’s all about patience and using our opportunities,.”
