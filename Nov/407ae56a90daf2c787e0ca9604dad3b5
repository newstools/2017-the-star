Mwingi North MP Paul Nzengu has pledged to serve all his constituents regardless of whether or not they backed his election on August 8. “The elections are now behind us. It is time for development and service delivery. All people of Mwingi North will be served without discrimination or favour,” he said. Nzengu said he recognises it was the constitutional right of voters to choose their favourite candidate. “I want to assure that I am the MP of all people in Mwingi North... The bottom line is that I will serve all diligently,” he said. Nzengu spoke during the burial of resident Jackson Mukiti in Mbarani village on Saturday.   Mukiti was a driver with Unimark Freighters Ltd. He was electrocuted on November 2 while hanging his clothes on a line. The MP echoed the same message when he attended another burial - of Kathini Ndongo - in the neighbouring Kalia village. Nzengu said he was accessible to all residents.  “I have adopted an open-door policy as your MP. You do not need intermediaries to reach me,” he said.
