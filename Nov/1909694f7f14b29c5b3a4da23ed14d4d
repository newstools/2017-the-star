A civil society group has asked three NGOs summoned to appear before their regulator today to ignore the call. The NGO Co-ordination Board had summoned officials of Inuka Kenya, Katiba Institute and Muslims for Human Rights to appear before it today. Inuka Kenya is linked to anti-graft crusader John Githongo while Katiba Institute is associated with Yash Pal Ghai. Officials of the three organisations had been asked to appear before the Fazul Mahamed-led board today over claims of non-disclosure of their financial returns. Detectives from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations, Kenya Revenue Authority, and the Financial Reporting Centre are expected in the meeting. But the Civil Society Reference group asked the three organisations to ignore the summons. It said the board and KRA lack both the legal and moral authority to regulate the sector. “KRA lost any pretence to autonomy as a tax collector when its senior officials allowed themselves to be used as the registered officials of Friends of Jubilee Foundation, which coincidentally is also registered as an NGO under the NGO Coordination Act,” convener Suba Churchill (pictured) said. “Officials of one NGO cannot summon officials of another NGO under the pretext of enforcing tax compliance,” Churchill said in a statement yesterday. The lobby said even if the NGO Board were to have the powers to summon any organisation, its current composition lacks representation of the NGO Council as provided for under the NGO Act. The board must have seven representatives of the NGO Council to constitute a quorum.
