A court has asked the Meru returning officer to give Mugambi Imanyara certified copies of Senator Mithika Linturi's academic qualifications and self-declaration form. Imanyara sued IEBC and RO Macharia Gichichi over the outcome of the August 8 general election, which he claimed was rigged.

They claimed he falsified his Bachelor of Commerce degree from University of Nairobi, and presented it to the commission in 2013 when he vied for MP. They also said his self-declaration form was forged. Both Linturi and Imanyara were in court on Wednesday. Judge Ann Ongi'njo said the documents given to the IEBC must be supplied to ascertain Linturi's qualifications. Following agreement by both parties, the High Court pushed the hearings from November 22 - 24 to December 11 - 15. The adjustment came after the court heard that IEBC was in contempt for not putting KIEMS information into an SD card that the petitioner sought. Imanyara said the information was critical. Linuri's lawyer Tom Ojienda said both parties needed time to scrutinise the information as the county's ballot boxes were being sealed. In June, the former Igembe South MP lost his bid to stop the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission from summoning him regarding the credibility of the self-declaration form he presented to IEBC.  Meanwhile, Imanyara's application to summon three witnesses to court was dismissed. The three are teachers whom the petitioner says are public officers and accuses of bungling the vote and acting for Linturi.
