The Road Safety Association of Kenya has urged Kenha to build more speed bumps and instal road signs on the deadly 14km stretch between Salgaa and Sachangwan on the Nakuru–Eldoret highway. The association officials said this will reduce the number of accidents on the stretch. Wambugu Nyamu, the technical secretary for speed governors, on Monday said the move is essential given the high peed at which motorists drive on that stretch. He spoke after visiting the scene of the accident that claimed 12 lives near Salgaa early Sunday morning. Nyamu, also the association secretary, said even before the state builds a dual carriageway from Kibunja, a short-term solution should be sought. Rongai police boss Joseph Kioko said, “This is a clear straight stretch of road. The problem is lack of discipline and lack of strict law enforcement. The area needs permanent 24-hour police patrol to catch reckless drivers and make them pay fines,”” he said. Freewheeling, speeding and lack of road signs have been cited as the major causes of accidents. This forced the National Transport and Safety Authority to deploy a patrol vehicle on the stretch last year. The vehicle, which is fitted with speed cameras, was to patrol the black spot on a 24-hour basis.  Nyamu asked drivers to be on the lookout for the increased number of cattle that graze near roads at night. “Some farmers take their animals to graze in farms at night, leave them there and go back to sleep till dawn,” Sachangwan resident Grace Kariuki said. “This is one of reasons that caused the Sunday accident as a cow was roaming the road.” Road Safety Association of Kenya chairman David Kiarie said the association will persist with safety campaigns on the roads.
