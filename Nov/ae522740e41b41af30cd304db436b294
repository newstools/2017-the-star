The Wajir government seeks to boost harvesting and processing of gum and resins to create jobs. It has launched a study to look into the best harnessing methods.  Governor Mohamed Abdi on Saturday said the initiative will be carried out in partnership with Finland Church Aid — a Finnish church organisation. He met officials from the organisation. Wajir is the largest producer of the two products in Kenya, hence the need to build a processing plant at Lanbiib Centre, six kilometres from Wajir town, he said. The study is expected to introduce better harvesting methods. Traditional methods have led to over-harvesting and drying up of trees. “My administration is committed to establishing a well-resourced department on alternative livelihoods with regard to natural resources such as gum, resins and aloe vera, among others,” Abdi said. Wajir South livestock production officer Julius Mwangi said the gum and resins will be sold to the food, pharmaceutical and paint-making industries. “Gum and resins are produced naturally in eight counties — Garissa, Isiolo, Mandera, Marsabit, Samburu, Turkana and Wajir,” he said. Residents have welcomed the decision. They said it will go a long way in creating jobs and generating alternative income sources for the mainly pastoral communities in the county. “Providing equipment and funding for harvesters and encouraging them to plant more trees will boost income and help fight desertification,” resident Abdirizak Jelle said.
