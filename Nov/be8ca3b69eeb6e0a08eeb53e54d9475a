The beef between Wizkid and Davido seems to heat up as time goes by. The latest news is that Davido's and Wizkid's teams fought in Dubai, and all because of Tekno. According to The Net, the cause of fracas, which happened after Thursday’s One Africa Music Fest Concert, has nothing to do with the simmering beef between the two of them. The Net says the fight happened as a result of an assault on Tekno by Wizkid’s long-term manager, Sunday Are. Reliable sources confirmed to Net that after Tekno’s performance, he went backstage and saw Wizkid’s camp. Recall that although it had initially seemed as though the singer took sides with Davido against Wizkid, the two of them collaborated on the freshly released Mama. Tekno then went over to greet them and stretched his hand to shake hands with Are. The elderly man took offence at the ‘disrespect’ shown by Tekno and reacted by punching him.
