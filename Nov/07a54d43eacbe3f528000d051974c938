Trans Nzoia Deputy Governor Stanley
Tarus has said they will sack Finance department staff after a 70 per cent drop in revenue collection. Revenue collection has reportedly fallen from Sh600 million to Sh200 million annually. Tarus said a reshuffle will be carried out as part of efforts to improve revenue collection and "lazy workers will be fired". "We have given revenue staff two months to ensure that they meet their collection targets
or they will be fired. They must shape up or ship out,” Tarus said on Friday. Tarus spoke during a meeting with county revenue staff. He said he agreed with Governor Patrick Khaemba that the trend is unacceptable. "If
residents of Trans Nzoia are paying revenue and a few staff mess up with it
then that is unacceptable,” he said. Some 300 county workers were turned away from the Kitale offices after reporting to work late. Tarus said they will be required to explain in writing why they should not be dismissed for failing to adhere to work regulations. He said members of the public had complained of poor service delivery by workers.
 "We have agreed that it will not be business
as usual in Trans Nzoia. Things have to change and residents of Trans Nzoia
must get value for the taxes they pay.” the deputy governor said.
