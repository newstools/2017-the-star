Kajiado Governor Joseph ole Lenku yesterday fired and replaced 100 striking nurses and promised to sack more. He announced this after it became clear services were being hampered, especially in rural health facilities. “We’ve replaced 100 nurses. There are more to replace. We cannot trade our people’s lives with anything. We are mitigating on the effects of the strike. Our people are suffering too much,” Lenku said in a statement. Kajiado has about 330 nurses — most of whom are on strike. The new nurses will be dispatched to 12 health facilities, with the County Referral Hospital getting 10, the statement read. “The majority will serve in the outlying health facilities in highly populated such as Ongata Rongai, Ngong and Kitengela, while others will be in rural facilities,” the county chief said. Rural facilities to benefit include Loitokitok, Kimana, Namanga, Ilbissil, Isinya, Entasopia, Masimba and Mashuuru. Health CEC Esther Somoire said the move will improve services.
