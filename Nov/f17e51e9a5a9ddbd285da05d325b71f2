Eight former board members of the Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company have sued Governor Mike Sonko over alleged unlawful suspension. They are Raphael Nzomo, Kennedy Omoke, Lawrence Ouma, John Wanyama, Joanne Mwangi, Rosemary Khamati, Mercy Mutua and Samuel Ojanga The eight received the letter suspending the board’s operations on September 27.  It was alleged there were serious allegations of misconduct by the board of directors of the Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company. However, the allegations were not mentioned. According to the suit papers, the eight have not been informed of the nature of the misconduct. They are seeking orders to stop the sewerage company or Nairobi county government officials from harassing them or investigating them. Also sought is an order suspending the letter, which stopped all operations of the board, pending determination of their case. They sued the Nairobi county government, acting county secretary Leboo ole Morintat and Governor Sonko. They argued that even if the county government wanted to protect public interest parties, it should not infringe on the rights of the people involved. In this case, they said the county government’s actions deprived them of their rights to human dignity and equality. The eight say the operation and business of the sewerage company is deadlocked, following their suspension and the court should give them reprieve with that in mind. In August, the board declined to renew the contracts of managing director Philip Gichuki and three other directors.  Gichuki faulted the board’s decision, saying he should have served for five years until 2019.  “The board did not follow the Human Resource Manual, which states that I should serve for five years. I joined the company in 2014 and therefore my term was supposed to expire in 2019. So they have shortened my term by two years,” he said.
