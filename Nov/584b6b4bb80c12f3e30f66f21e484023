The Kenya Trade Network Agency has devised an information system for traders that will reduce fraud and simplify regulatory procedures. The information trade portal will serve as a one-stop-shop for the trade community having integrated at least 31 of the 35 state agencies involved in trade. InfoTrade portal will provide traders and other stakeholders with transparent rules and procedures pertaining to import and export formalities. This will be through detailed, practical and up-to-date descriptions of steps to go through, to assist users make informed business decisions. “If you are a trader, the portal will enable you to access all the relevant documentation requirements for imports and or exports of your respective commodities from the comfort of your office or place of business,” Kentrade chief executive Amos Wangora said during the launch. The portal will enhance compliance in the trade sector by cutting back unwarranted penalties resulting from documentation errors which would in turn reduce chances of corruption. It will host information on trade related laws, regulations, acts and legislations, a summary of foreign trade processes and boost transparency in the sector. It is in line with World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade Facilitation.
