Former Wajir Governor Ahmed Abdullahi yesterday denied claims by the electoral agency he has duplicated NASA leader Raila Odinga's petition. Ahmed told Justice Alfred Mabeya the allegations by the lawyer he has used evidence in the presidential petition filed by Raila against President Uhuru Kenyatta to challenge the election results of Mohamed Abdi of Jubilee who won in August 8 were untrue. He said the allegations are false and malicious. Lawyer Tom Macharia said this in the case where Ahmed was testifying in the petition. Ahmed said that results from some polling stations failed to pass through the KIEMS kits and no data was on the IEBC portal. "My agents deserved to know what was happening in all polling stations, but they were unable to access some of them," he said. He also said forms were not signed by the presiding officers at some polling stations. In the petition, Ahmed and Muhumed Abdi, alleged currrent Governor Mohamed Abdi does not meet the qualifications. Ahmed and Muhumed allege the governor falsified his academic documents and he either concealed, falsified or altered the documents, when he filed the self-declaration forms at the EACC. The two allege his concealing of his qualifications is a demonstration that Abdi lacks integrity. The two petitioners also disputed the election outcome, saying the tallying or votes from the polling stations were incorrect and contained serious errors.
