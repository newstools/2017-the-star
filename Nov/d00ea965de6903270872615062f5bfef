Former Nyeri Governor Wahome Gakuru’s Mercedes-Benz E250 was faulty. His successor Mutahi Kahiga said Gakuru had complained the vehicle will kill him because it was defective. Speaking during a memorial service at Dedan Kimathi University, Nyeri, yesterday, he said the car was among many other faulty county vehicles. “Gakuru had on several occasions complained the car will kill him one day. He used his personal car regularly,” Kahiga said. He defended the supplementary budget in which the Finance executive has allocated Sh13 million for a Prado. “The Sh13 million is for the governor’s vehicle. The ones used by my predecessor was faulty,” Kahiga said.  “The one I’m using is borrowed from the Finance ministry. The governor needs to use a proper and safe car.”  promises accountability Gakuru died after a grisly road accident last Tuesday on the Thika Superhighway. The police and some companies, including DT Dobie and Pirelli, are investigating. Kahiga defended the Sh22 million set aside for construction and refurbishment of the governor’s and deputy governor’s residences.  He said the Salaries and Remuneration Commission has given counties until next year to have permanent residences for governors, deputy governors and speakers, instead of spending money on rent and mortgages. Kahiga was with Nyeri Town MP Ngunjiri Wambugu, Gakuru’s widow Catherine Wahome, county executives and former Nyeri woman representative Priscilla Nyokabi. He said the county’s money will be utilised well and will be accounted for.
