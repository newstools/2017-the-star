Mombasa Governor Ali Hassan Joho and his Kilifi counterpart Amason Kingi do not have enough numbers to push for Coast's secession, a local NGO has said. Pwani ni Kenya, an NGO formed to counter the Mombasa Republican Council’s call for secession, yesterday told the Star that the governors' call for Coast breakaway is a waste of time. Chairman Alex Kasuku said it will be impossible for the duo to successfully realise their call. “Let leaders be sincere with those they represent. They need numbers in Parliament to push for secession. As we speak, the region lacks the numbers in the National Assembly," Kasuku told the Star on the phone. Kasuku said unless the leaders want ‘to go to the bush’, secession will not be achieved. Joho and Kingi cited economic and political marginalisation of the region as their main reason for the secession push. The secession call has since received opposition from Jubilee politicians, envoys and a section of the civil society. Kasuku said the region would be better off with more jobs for the youth and a general development programme. He asked the leaders to exploit opportunities presented by devolution. “The two leaders have failed the most in the six counties at the Coast yet they are now the ones leading the secession call,” said Kasuku. He said it is curious that the two governors have had a change of heart when they were in the forefront opposing the secession call by MRC between 2010 and 2014. This is the time Pwani ni Kenya set up many barazas across the Coast region to counter the violent secession calls by MRC. Kasuku, who chaired most of the counter-secession calls in barazas was attacked several times by MRC sympathizers. “We will start another round of regionwide barazas to counter these calls again,” said Kasuku.
