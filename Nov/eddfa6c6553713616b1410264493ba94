Nandi Hekima Sacco has obtained a temporary injunction to stop Chase Bank from selling one of their prime properties in Kapsabet town. The cash-strapped sacco went to court to block the sale after Chase Bank advertised for public auctioning one of their buildings in Kapsabet. The bank wants to recover Sh12.5 million it loaned the sacco. It has defaulted. The Labour Relations Court in Eldoret issued the temporary orders as the sacco sought an out-of-court settlement. The cooperative secured the overdraft in 2011 to revamp another subsidiary firm, Hekima Holdings Ltd, and used their prime property registered as LR 181/117 that houses the sacco as security. The building is estimated to be worth more than Sh30 million. The majority of shareholders are small-scale tea growers from all six subcounties in Nandi. Sacco chairman James Bassy said the overdraft was obtained fraudulently as it lacked the  shareholders’ approval. Bassy says the title deed used belongs to Nandi Hekima Sacco and not the subsidiary Hekima Holdings originally registered as LR 1181/113. The chairman accused the bank of failing to verify the ownership of the property.
