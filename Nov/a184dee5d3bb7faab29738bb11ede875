Mbeere South MP Geoffrey King’ang’i has condemned the forcible circumcision of seven schoolgirls in his constituency last week. The seven girls, aged between nine and 11, were left hospitalised following the cruel cutting. Two parents of the girls were arrested while another two were still on the run. Police also arrested the woman who carried out the mutilation. King’ang’i accused the parents of dragging behind his constituency’s growth by practising a “backward and primitive” culture. “I condemn them in the strongest terms possible. We urge the government to arrest and charge anybody found perpetuating this vice,” King’ang’i said. He called for harsh sentences against perpetrators, saying it will serve as a warning to would-be culprits. He said he had hoped that residents had abandoned Female Genital Mutilation following a sustained campaign by the government and NGOs against the practice. King’ang’i said he will lead a renewed campaign to protect young girls from harmful cultural practices. He asked churches to organise alternative rites of passage camps for young girls where they could be trained on responsible adulthood.  Mwangaza Rights Women’s Organisation also condemned the incident.
