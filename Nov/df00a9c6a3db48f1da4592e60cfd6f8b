New Nyeri governor Mutahi Kahiga will be sworn in
after the burial of his predecessor Wahome Gakuru on 18th November. Nyeri legal adviser Mwangi Mugo said the deputy
governor will be sworn in as Nyeri governor after the burial ceremony on
Saturday next week since it is his wish of Kahiga. Speaking to media, Mugo said there is no power
vacuum in Nyeri county government since other officers including CECs and Chief
Officers are still on job. Meanwhile, Nyeri teachers have put on hold the
slated protests in Nyeri after wider consultations with other stakeholders. Nyeri KNUT branch Chairman Patrick Karinga said the
protests have been stopped for now after they called Kahiga who said he would
wish to first give Gakuru a decent state burial. Karinga said the teachers were ready to protest over
the delay of swearing in ceremony but now have understood the matter. The swearing in ceremony was earlier scheduled for Thursday but postponed the last minute after what was termed as consultations with the Council of Governors. The teachers on the other hand received a backlash
from social media who told them to first mourn the departed governor. The union officials have expressed their dissatisfaction
of not swearing in the governor who is a trade unionist and a former teacher. They said that a similar scenario occurred in February
this year and the then deputy governor Samuel Wamathai was sworn in immediately
after death of Governor Nderitu Gachagua. Meanwhile at Gakuru’s home in Kirichu area, it was a
beehive of activities as locals prepared for 18th November burial
plans. On Friday, inmates from G.K King’ong’o prison joined
the locals in preparation of the home as family and friends continue streaming
at the home to condole the family. Ends….
