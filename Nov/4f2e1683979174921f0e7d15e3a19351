Meru county statistics officer Joseph M’ ikabu  has urged leaders to analyse statistics before implementing projects. He said statistics plays a major role in economic and social development. M’ikabu said governments  should have statistics at hand when crafting the County Intergrated Development Plan. He spoke last Friday in Meru during Africa Statistics Day celebrations. “Meru is a big county with about 11 subcounties and different types of climate. Without data, the county government will hustle to know how to empower its people. That is why statistics are important,” he said.   M’ikabu said with statistics, planning is effective. “This will enable equitable distribution of resources in projects that will  help residents,” he said.
