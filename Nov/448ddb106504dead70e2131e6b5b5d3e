The Trans Nzoia government has established an innovation hub to
empower the youth economically. Governor Patrick Khaemba said IHub is designed to provide a
platform for innovation and business incubation. More than 60 per cent of the youth in the county are unemployed. “We will be equipping this hub with necessary facilities and explore
partnerships that will inspire growth of ideas,” Khaemba said in Kitale yesterday. The county chief also said his administration will explore partnerships with
institutions of higher learning, to establish training centres for soft skills
and other specialised training for the youth. “By so doing, this will allow our young people to gain knowledge that will
market them beyond our borders,” he said. Khaemba urged all stakeholders and Trans Nzoia residents to support the
initiative.
