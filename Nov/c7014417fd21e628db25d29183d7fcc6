Raw milk sold by vendors is likely to be dirty and contaminated with harmful chemicals, and a risk to health, the Kenya Dairy Board has warned. Director Margaret Kibogy yesterday said such milk is not tested at source and during handling, hence its quality and safety cannot be guaranteed.  “It’s also not processed, regulated and traceable. The handling practices are generally poor and predispose the milk to contamination, including adulteration,” she said. Kibogy defended processed milk and said 98.6 per cent is of high quality. She was reacting to a recent study, which found that farmers and raw milk vendors routinely add water, antibiotics and unauthorised preservative herbs to their milk. “The Kenya Dairy Board has consistently encouraged consumers to buy milk and products of certified quality — milk that has been processed, packaged and tested at every stage of production,” Kibogy said. “The products are certified, labelled and traceable.” The study by researchers from the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, the University of Nairobi and the Agriculture ministry was published three weeks ago in the Panafrican Medical Journal. The researchers said 15.5 per cent of milk sourced directly from farmers and 18.4 per cent from vendors tested positive for antimicrobial residues. They found that male vendors trained on safe milk practices were actually the ones breaking the law. “Of the 152 vendors, only six or 3.9 per cent of male vendors had been trained on good milk handling practices, of which five or 83.3 per cent were found to be selling milk of poor compositional quality,” the study said. The study was carried out in Lamu, but the authors say the findings rhyme with other studies conducted in Nairobi, Nakuru and Narok. Water was identified as the main adulterant. Water lowers the nutritional value of milk, interferes with processing qualities and poses a risk of contaminating it.
