Two sisters aged 13 and 11 years from Rutara village in Kanjuiri ward, Ol Kalou constituency, have been left traumatised after being forced to undergo FGM. Simforosa Gichohi, a children’s officer in Tumaini location, said the children were subjected to the ordeal last Saturday night at Ngorika village. She said the 50-year-old girls’ mother told them to prepare so she could take them to visit their grandmother at Ngorika. They were taken to a 75-year-old woman’s home and at 8pm, the girls were blindfolded and taken behind her house.  They were pushed to the ground and their mother and other people held their hands and legs apart as the 75-year-old woman operated on them with a pair of scissors. When they returned home, a villager noticed something was amiss and the girls told her what happened. The matter was reported to the police. The circumciser and girls’ mother were arrested.
