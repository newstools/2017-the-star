Safaricom, Kenya's biggest mobile telecoms company, reported a sharp drop in profits growth on Friday, hit by a faltering economy partly disrupted by the political uncertainty. The company, 35 per cent owned by South African group Vodacom and five per cent by Vodacom's majority shareholder Vodafone, also said Chief Executive Bob Collymore has taken leave to undergo "specialised medical treatment" which will take 'a number of months".

"Kenya is going through a difficult macroeconomic situation, which is a reality which will affect Safaricom," said Chief Financial Officer, Sateesh Kamath. The CFO, together with Joseph Ogutu, director for strategy and innovation, have taken over Collymore's responsibilities during his absence. "We have a very strong and robust team and the only thing that may be lacking would be Bob's presence and his overall image and stature," said Chairman Nicholas Ng'ang'a, who declined to comment further on Collymore's condition. Kamath also said the company was maintaining its full-year profit forecast for earnings before interest and tax to rise to between Sh71 and 75 billion, up from Sh67 billion last time. Last week, Kenya held a repeat presidential election after the Supreme Court nullified the results from an August poll on procedural grounds. President Uhuru Kenyatta won the October 26 contest with 98 per cent of the vote after the opposition boycotted the election, saying it would be unfair. On Friday the opposition called for Kenyans to boycott Safaricom because it had helped transmit results during the October election.

The company plans to launch an e-commerce service known as Masoko in mid-November, modelled on China's Alibaba, with the platform already offering 30,000 different products, Kamath said. It also plans to increase the number of houses connected to its fibre broadband network by up to 60 percent in the next two quarters, from 100,000 currently. Meanwhile first-half revenue from its mobile money transfer service, M-Pesa, rose 16 per cent to Sh30 billion, while revenue from phone calls rose by 3.6 per cent to Sh47.35 billion. Mobile internet service revenue was up by close to a third at Sh17.55 billion. Total revenue rose to Sh114.43 billion from Sh102.10 billion in the same period last year. Earnings per share for Safaricom, typically the most traded stock on the Nairobi Securities Exchange, rose to Sh0.65, from Sh0.60 in the same period last year. Safaricom's shares were up two per cent at Sh25.75 at 1220 GMT, taking the gain this year to over 34 per cent. In May, Vodafone moved to consolidate two of its African interests with the sale of a 35 per cent stake in Safaricom to Vodacom in exchange for an increased stake in Vodacom, where it was already majority owner.
