The hearing of a Sh17.9 million corruption case against former President Moi’s aide Joshua Kulei (pictured) and two former senior government officials was yesterday adjourned until December 13. When the case came up for hearing before trial magistrate Felix Kombo of the Milimani Anti-Corruption Court, the court was informed the defence was not ready. The prosecution, led by senior state counsel Victor Mule, did not oppose the defence’s request, but informed the court it was ready with two witnesses. The magistrate had earlier fixed the hearing after the DPP rejected the defence’s application seeking an out-of-court settlement. The defence had been given time after lawyers representing the accused, led by Pravin Bowry, protested saying the DPP is taking too long to make his decision on whether the case proceed to hearing or is put to an end.  Kulei is charged alongside former Kenya Airports Authority chief Peter Langat, Wilson Gachanja, a former Lands commissioner, and Ezekiel Komen, a former Kenya Pipeline Company managing director.
