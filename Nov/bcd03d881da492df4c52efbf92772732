Governor Mike Sonko yesterday sent his congratulatory message to President Uhuru Kenyatta after the Supreme Court upheld his re-election. In a statement, Sonko expressed his readiness to work with the government for better service delivery. "I look forward to working with you to develop closer relations between your Government and my administration for better service delivery," the statement read. “I also wish you success in performing the important and responsible duties of your position,” Sonko added. In an unanimous decision, the Supreme Court dismissed the petitions challenging President Uhuru Kenyatta’s re-election, on grounds that they lacked merit. This now paves the way for Uhuru's swearing in on Tuesday next week. The court will however give its detailed decision in 21 days.
