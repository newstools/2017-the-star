Lecturers on Wednesday began their strike in push for implementation of the new salary and house allowance structures.  UASU secretary general Constantine Wasonga said this should be dealt with as stipulated in their 2013-17 CBA. Speaking in Nairobi on Wednesday, he asked lecturers to stay away from work until they are paid their new salaries. The union further accused the government of reneging on its promise to pay them the agreed salaries. Implementation of the Sh10 billion Collective Bargaining Agreement hit a snag in what university administrations blamed on lack of cash. The union said Sh5.2bn is required to effect the new pay structure in the 2013-17 CBA.  The CBA, signed on March, was to be implemented in July after the government released Sh6 billion to cater for the salaries. A lot of the money was used in settling arrears that had accumulated since 2013. Read: Dons go on strike today after ministry fails to implement CBA
