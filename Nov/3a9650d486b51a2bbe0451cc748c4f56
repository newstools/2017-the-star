Opposition leader Raila Odinga is misleading his supporters
by urging them to boycott products from certain companies, Nairobi Jubilee
politician Francis Mwangi said yesterday.  He said thousands of Nairobians and Kenyans in other parts of the
country directly or indirectly earn a living from the companies NASA has blacklisted. “Their livelihoods are at stake if the boycott is effected. Who will feed their families? Who will pay school fees for their children?” Mwangi said on the phone.  He said it was ironical for Raila to ask NASA supporters
to boycott products from companies where hundreds of them work. “As a proprietor who runs a school, I know very well these companies
don’t employ people based on tribe, it is purely based on merit and this means
there are many of their supporters working in these companies,” Mwangi said.  Last Thursday, NASA asked its supporters to shun services and
products from Safaricom, Brookside Dairy and Bidco Kenya.
