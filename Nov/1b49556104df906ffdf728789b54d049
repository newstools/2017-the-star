The High Court has turned down former Kisumu Governor Jack Ranguma's plea to scrutinise and recount votes cast on August 8. Ranguma, through his lawyer Richard Onsongo, said the recount was essential as the election was marred by irregularities. He wants Governor Anyang' Nyong'o's win nullified but judge David Majanja dismissed the request saying it suffered a "congenital birth effect as the petitioner's affidavit does not set out which polling stations require further examination". 'I'm not convinced at this stage hat it would be appropriate to issue such orders, perhaps the examination and cross-examination of the respondent's witness and more particularly returning officers may convince me to act 'suo moto (on its own motion)'," he said on Thursday. "For now, the order I can make is to dismiss the application." Noting such applications must have specific details about polling stations, Majanja said the applications by the petitioner and witnesses were broad, vague and could not form the basis of a scrutiny order. In his affidavit, Ranguma says several electoral malpractices were committed during voting and transmission of results. He further told the court his agents were denied access to several voting and tallying centres and threatened by presiding officers. Ranguma also said some voters were given more than one ballot paper to cast in Nyong'o's favour.  "There was also failure to mark and secure spoilt votes which were later counted in his fabour," he added. "That was part of the strategy to deny me my victory." The case continues.
