A man has died after he was clobbered by Nyumba Kumi members in Ichuga village, Kieni East subcounty, Nyeri county, on Tuesday night. Wachira Kabue, 46, died at Nanyuki Teaching and Referral Hospital on Wednesday morning. Members of Nyumba Kumi, allegedly led by chief Lucy Njeri and her assistant, raided Kabue’s home at 8pm in search of illicit brew. When the search yielded nothing, the group turned on Kabue and a friend and beat them up. Duncan Gitonga, 50, who was with Kabue, said they were beaten with metal bars, crowbars and stones. “Wachira even dared them to kill him instead of leaving him to live with disability. They called an Administration Police vehicle from Baraka AP post in Laikipia East subcounty, which took us to hospital,” he said. Kabue’s widow Martha Mumbi said she was informed by a neighbor while at the market where she sells vegetables that her husband was being attacked. She rushed home, but the Nyumba Kumi troops did not allow her into her house. “One of them told me to collect my husband’s dead body and bury it. When I took him to hospital together with the AP officers, it took the intervention of our pastor for him to be admitted,” Mumbi said. “He died on Wednesday morning shortly after we served him tea.” The couple had three children, two girls aged seven and eight, and a boy aged three. Mumbi said the Nyumba Kumi troops trashed her house and stole a gas cylinder, a television set and chicken.  On Thursday, Naromoru police station OCS George Odongo and area DCIO Wangatia visited the homestead to collect evidence. Contacted on Thursday, area deputy county commissioner James Chacha said he was unaware of the incident and would give details once he is briefed.  A week ago Nyumba Kumi members in South Imenti village, Laikipia county, beat to death a 14-year-old boy for allegedly stealing a transistor radio and Sh700.
