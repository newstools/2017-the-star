There were celebrations at Moi Primary School in Gatanga subcounty, Murang’a, after 15 students qualified for admission in national schools. This is a sharp increase from the performance the school posted last year, when only one pupil scored more than 400 marks. Head teacher Jenniffer Gichore said the excellent performance was as a result of hard work amongst pupils and teachers. The teacher, who joined the school in April, was transferred from Mbiri Primary School. She said the cordial relationship between her teachers and pupils has improved the school’s performance. Meanwhile, Vidhu Ramji Primary School in Murang’a town produced the best student in the county with 442 marks. Nixon Njiru was followed by Irungu Fridah Muthithi from Technology Primary School, who scored 436. In the preliminary results, Technology School, Bishop Perlo Academy and St Paul Thomas Academy emerged as the top performers. Girls out-performed boys for the second year in a row after a long period of dominance by boys. Technology School head teacher Beatrice Wachira said more than 12 pupils, out of the 78 candidates in her school, have scored more than 400. Wachira said the first pupil last year had 420 marks compared to the 436 the school has posted this year.  “These results are impressive, but I have to say it is a result of hard work and sheer determination,” Wachira said. She praised her teachers for working late hours to ensure the pupils passed. Wachira continued that the school hopes to perform even better next year. Muthithi from Technology School, who would like to be a cardiologist, said prayers and hard work made it possible to score the high marks. The 14-year-old girl said her dream is to be admitted to Kenya High School. The second pupil at the school, Sheila Njeri, scored 434 marks, while Loyce Wangechi came in third with 431 marks.
