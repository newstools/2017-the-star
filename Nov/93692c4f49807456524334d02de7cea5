Education officials in Elgeyo Marakwet are on high alert following KCSE exam leakage allegations as police probe a second school head over irregularities. Kobulwo Secondary School head teacher Stephen Bartoo recorded a statement on Friday in Keiyo North, a day after Moi Kapsowar Girls’ High School principal Dinah Cheruiyot was questioned by police in Kapsowar, Marakwet West. The two principals are suspected to have received leaked KCSE papers via WhatsApp during the first week of the exam. But education officials, led by the county director of Education Joseph Wamocho, have defended the principals, saying they did not share the leaked papers.
