Marakwet women and girls are living in fear as forced Female Genital Mutilation takes place massively and secretly in villages. At least 130 women and girls have been forcibly circumcised alongside boys in the area. Chiefs and their assistants yesterday said circumcisers are protected from arrest by murderous goons. Eleven underage girls underwent FGM in Kipchumwa location on Tuesday last week, barely a week after two other girls were circumcised in Kipkaner. Koibirir chief Harun Kisang said 15 girls underwent FGM when the period began two weeks ago. He was prevented from stopping the outlawed rites by armed youths.Kisang said an unknown number of girls have been cut at night in the bush. “I was personally chased and warned by hired goons who blocked my way,” Kisang said.
