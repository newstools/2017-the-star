Airtel is running out of airtime recharge cards in Busia town (pictured), after scores of people believed to NASA supporters, migrated from Safaricom.  A spot check by the Star yesterday showed many residents heeded NASA leader Raila Odinga’s call to boycott products from Safaricom, Bidco and Brookside. NASA claims the firms support the Jubilee administration. A majority of card sellers in Busia told the Star they have run out of Airtel airtime cards for the last three days. Many people have been flocking to their shops to purchase Airtel cards. “Who are we to go against what Baba [Raila] has said? We will continue supporting NASA until it achieves its goal of liberating Kenyans from dictatorship,” one customer said. Some Safaricom subscribers, however, said they cannot shift to Airtel because there are not enough Airtel Money outlets. Safari com shops are everywhere.  “You can’t easily find Airtel Money in small trading centres. I will be forced to go to Port Victoria, Funyula or Busia town to withdraw money,” a resident from Maumau in Budalang’i said.  Bwiri Ward ODM coordinator Thomas Buluma said Ganga trading centre, Funyula also lacks cards.  Some traders said they are  forced to buy milk products from Nairobi-based Uplands Premium Dairies and cooking oil and bar soap from other companies.
