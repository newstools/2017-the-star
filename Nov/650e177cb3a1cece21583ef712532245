Embu residents have defended the region's water supplier against attacks by a section of MCAs blaming it for the recent cholera outbreak. This followed a social media campaign by a section of legislators after tree people died from cholera on Monday. The said MCAs accused the firm of distributing substandard water to its consumers and further called for the disbandment of its board of directors. But angry residents on Friday accused the legislators of interfering with the operations of the regions' water and sewerage company. They said the lot is wrong in blaming the Embu Water and Sewerage Company for the cholera outbreak. Irene Mwaniki of Gatondo village in Mbeti North said some MCAs want EWASCO to be run like a political institution. "We are aware of their intentions. They want the company to be run like the county assembly. Some of the MCAs have hidden personal interests," Mwaniki said. She said some ward representatives want to reward their political supporters with positions at the company's board. "They are spreading mere propaganda about the management of the institution so that it can be dissolved," she said on Friday. Ritah Kabata, an EWASCO official, said their water is safe as they use state-of-the-art technology to treat the commodity. "We assure our clients that the water is safe for human consumption and any other domestic use," she said. Protesting in support of the firm, they asked Governor Martin
Wambora to probe the MCAs portraying the water company in bad light. They threatened to hold more demonstrations if the water company's affairs is politicised. The protesters' argument is that those who were infected are from the lowlands and mainly draw water directly from rivers. Read: 17 with cholera-like symptoms admitted in Embu, 3 positive Â
