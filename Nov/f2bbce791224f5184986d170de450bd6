Agriculture CS Willy Bett has said he will gazette regulations to streamline operations in the sugar industry. The announcement was in response to intense lobbying by stakeholders and leaders from sugarcan-growing regions. They said lack of regulations has given room for corruption and sugar barons to kill the industry. The leaders spoke during the National Sugar Industry consultative forum in Kisumu on Thursday. They said farmers' payments, infrastructure, funding, cane development and bulk equipment in the factories must be given priority. “With the today's consultative meeting I do believe that it is the right way to find the best solutions to the plight of the sugar subsector. There must be individual and collective contribution in the sector,” Bett said.
