The case in which Kikuyu MP Kimani Ichung’wa sued a resident who posted defamatory comments about him on WhatsApp and Facebook is still ongoing. The case was filed at the Kiambu High Court on October 12 last year through Gitonga Mureithi and Company Advocates. Ichung’wa said Morris Waceke’s remarks were meant to ruin his chances of winning. Ichung’wa retained his seat unopposed during the August 8 General Election. Through Uteti wa Kiambu WhatsApp group, Waceke wrote ,“I will not as well exchange insults with you. It’s just the other day you sent some goons to kill me. I’m still alive and protected by the blood of Jesus. About the bridge, you will answer to Wanjiku soon.” He also allegedly  wrote “How much does an MP earn for him to own property worth over Sh300 million?” Waceke has failed to appear in court. The case will be heard in February.
