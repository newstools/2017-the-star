Kiambu will soon hire additional firefighters to support 90 who are overwhelmed, Governor Ferdinand Waititu has said. Speaking at Thika Stadium on Tuesday, Waititu said plans are underway to employ more firefighters to boost the county’s emergency response. He did not disclose the number of recruits. He said the county will provide insurance cover for all firefighters. “Our firefighters do the exceptional work of rescuing lives and properties. We must not forget that they risk their lives,” Waititu said. He spoke during the opening of the Third World Fire Academy, a week-long training for firefighters from Taita Taveta, Kwale, Kilifi, Kiambu, Murang’a, Kisii, Isiolo, Marsabit and Makueni counties. The training is sponsored by Africa Fire Mission, a US-based NGO. Waititu said he will ask the county assembly to pass a law allowing the county to give risk allowances to firefighters. He said he will establish more fire stations in Juja, Lari, Gatundu North, Gatundu South and Kabete subcounties. The other seven subcounties already have fire stations.  He said the county had bought a new fire engine to make fire responses efficient and effective.  Kiambu firefighting unit leader Samuel Kahura called for an improved road network to provide access to slums and other areas.  “There are no proper roads to slums which are most prone to fires,” Kahura said.
