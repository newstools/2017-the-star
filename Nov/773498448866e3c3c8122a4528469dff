Tuskys Supermarket has taken over spaces left by Nakumatt in Kisii and Kisumu towns. The Kisii branch dubbed Tuskys Echiro (market) and Kisumu’s new branch called ‘Lolwe’ at Mega Plaza on Oginga Odinga Odinga Street opened their doors to shoppers on Tuesday last week as they seek to increase their market share in the country. The supermarket chain will now have two branches in the towns nearly a month after Nakumatt shut down the outlets. The existing branches are Tuskys Chigware and Tuskys United. According to Tuskys chief executive officer Dan Githua the opening of the two branches increases their network to 64 across the country and Uganda. In Kenya, they have 57 branches and seven in Uganda. “The opening of the Kisii and Kisumu branches provides us with a good opportunity to enhance our footprint and economic contribution in the fast growing Nyanza region,” he added. Nakumatt has faced severe challenges over mounting debts and suppliers’ decision to avoid the retailer. There are reports that Nakumatt and Tuskys are undertaking discussions for a possible merger arrangement.
