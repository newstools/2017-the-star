Violence erupted in the Murang’a county assembly on Monday after MCAs armed with hammers and clubs attempted to throw out clerk Chris Kinyanjui. They threw punches, smashed a desk and stole items. They accused Kinyanjui of reducing their allowances for a sporting event in Machakos last week. The MCAs said they each should have pocketed Sh58,800 in allowances for the six-day event. Kinyanjui paid them Sh42,000 each. Led by deputy speaker Samuel Kihurunjo, the MCAs stormed Kinyanjui’s office at 5pm and demanded he quit or be forced out. They wanted Kinyanjui to approve their mortgages and car loans without collateral. Kinyanjui refused.  “They want me to go against the law. It is impossible,” Kinyanjui said. He spoke after being rescued by police. MCAs also accused the clerk of violating tender rules in purchasing sports kits and uniforms. The MCAs said the kits were also substandard.  Kihurunjo had earlier called for a kamukunji where 28 MCAs agreed to storm Kinyanjui’s office to force him out It is said the kamukunji had not been approved by speaker Nduati Kariuki, who was out of the country. MCAs also threw journalists out of the assembly, saying they were discussing private matters. Murang’a East OCPD Johnstone Limo led officers in ejecting the MCAs from the clerk’s office and out of the assembly. The attack shocked residents. They said the MCAs could have sorted out their issues with the clerk without fistfights. Kinyanjui said the MCAs had violated standing orders and they would be punished. “The MCAs signed a code of conduct which prevents them from harassing employees,” Kinyanjui said.He said the powers and privileges committee, chaired by the speaker, will decide on the appropriate action to be taken against them.
