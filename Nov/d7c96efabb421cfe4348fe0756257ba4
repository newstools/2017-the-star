Nzoia Sugar Company is to carry out minor factory repairs for two weeks. Company acting MD Michael Kulundu yesterday said their goal is to restore efficiency and fast-track recovery. He said the annual maintenance scheduled for later this year will also go on. “The planned activity is different from the usual annual maintenance which the company has yet to undertake,” Kulundu said. “At the appropriate time, the company will announce the calendar for the annual maintenance. We remain hopeful the government will soon disburse the Sh300 million for annual maintenance. “The activity will focus on the boiler factory repairs, mills roller change and installation of key pumps.” He said the sugar plant should be repaired weekly for minor changes and annually for major changes to ensure it operates to the optimum. Kulundu urged farmers to be patient so the factory can serve them better. The repairs will delay the milling process only. All other operations will remain active, he said. The boiler produces steam that runs the turbines in the miller, hence, milling will be stopped.  “We will, however, continue to sell sugar and deal with other issues such as paying farmers,” Kulundu said.
