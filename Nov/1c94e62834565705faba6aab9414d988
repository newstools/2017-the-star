Education CS Fred Matiang’i has assured parents that marking of the KCSE exams will be fast-tracked to enable those who qualifyto join institutions of higher learning. He also said the ministry is committed to ensure the credibility of the exams. “I want to assure parents and candidates that marking of the exams will be hastened and results will be announced earlier than usual,” Matiang’i said. The CS spoke on Saturday at Nyabururu Girls’ National School in Kisii county. Matiang’i, who is also acting Interior CS, commended the KDF for supporting the government in ferrying of the exams to flood-prone areas. He said President Uhuru Kenyatta spends most of his time in formulating policies geared towards supporting education.  The CS also urged opposition leaders to use legal and constitutional ways to resolve conflicts. “I’m urging all leaders to preach peace. We will not allow instances where people threaten the peace. We want all Kenyans to go for Christmas holidays in peace,” Matiang’i said. He condemned the chaos that erupted in Nairobi last Friday after NASA leader Raila Odinga jetted back into the country.
