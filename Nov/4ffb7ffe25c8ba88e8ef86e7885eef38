Kenya Simbas have enlisted the services of South Africa’s Levy Labeeb from Western Province to help fine-tune their defence ahead of the Hong Kong Cup of Nations set to start this Friday. Head coach Jerome Paarwater said the Labeeb will be an important addition to the technical bench not only for the four nations but also next year’s Rugby World Cup qualifiers slated for South Africa in either June or July. “Our defensive alignment must improve. We had issues with our defence in the Africa Gold Cup and various test matches so he comes on board to fix certain elements of our structure,” added Paarwater. The team departed the country on Monday night and was expected to arrive in Hong Kong yesterday. The team is expected to rest and recover today before a training session on Thursday and the opening match against Chile on Friday. Paarwater is expecting a stern test from the three teams Kenya is facing with Simbas expected to play Russia on November 14 and hosts Hong Kong on November 18. “The matches are going to be competitive. We are playing teams that are ranked higher than us and we have to be at our best. The boys have trained hard in the past two months and are relishing the challenge. These are important matches as we try and build momentum for the Rugby World Cup qualifiers next year,” he said. Paarwater said he is keen to build depth in certain positions ahead of the World Cup qualifiers. “We are seeing some youngsters coming through like Henry Ayah at fly-half, Levy Amunga as a utility back and Frank Khalwale at hooker. This will be good for the team’s growth and development in the years to come,” noted Paarwater. He said the squad will have to adapt quickly to the humid conditions expected for the tournament. “We will have probably have a quick turn around to adjust to the conditions which will be very humid and we must vary our game to be competitive in the three fixtures,” he added.
