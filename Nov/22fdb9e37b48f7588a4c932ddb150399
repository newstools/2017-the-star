The Kikuyu Council of Elders has extended an olive branch to single mothers by offering to help them get their boys circumcised and taught about adulthood. Speaking at their headquarters in Kasarani yesterday, secretary general Peter Munga confirmed elders will conduct initiation on November 11 at Brookshine Academy in Kamulu. He said single mothers have difficulty getting their sons circumcised because Kikuyu culture does not allow women to be involved. “More wome have become single mothers as men abandon their role and it is a challenge for women since they do not know what to do with their boys when it comes to circumcision . It is the role of men,” Munga said. He said women are not involved because circumcision entails not only the act, but also teaching boys how to live as men, be role models and become leaders. “Those who get circumcised without being taught good morals are often exposed to the social ills, such as alcoholism, pre-marital sex and lack of morals.They end up not being respected men and that is the dilemma we have in our community,”Munga said.
