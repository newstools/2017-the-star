Catholic Bishop Cornelius Korir played an important role in uniting communities that were fighting in the troubled Kerio Valley. While eulogising Bishop Korir, who died on Monday, resdients said he was a unifying figure who preached peace at all times. Led by Richard Kayab, residents said they would remember Korir for restoring peace in Kerio Valley in 2002, when the state failed to unite warring communities. “People didn’t know about the government because the state abandoned us. It was the Catholic Church under the stewardship of Bishop Korir that united the communities,” Kayab said. Kayab is a Catholic Peace and Justice Coordinator in the bandit-plagued Kerio Valley. The valley is at the border of Elgeyo Marakwet, Baringo and West Pokot counties. In March last year, a bandit raid left more than 100 people dead. Again, it was Korir who visited the area first and appealed for peace. “He was a dedicated steward in peace building. He made a name in conflict resolution,” Kayab said. Kayab said they had planned for Korir to tour the region again in a few weeks. “We in Kerio Valley say our peace maker has gone to his maker,” Kayab said.  Elgeyo Marakwet Governor Alex Tolgos said Korir had worked tirelessly to restore peace in Kerio Valley. “He played a critical role to foster cohesion among communities in the North Rift region. His death has robbed us of a great peace maker,” Tolgos said. Bishop Korir was found dead at his home on Monday morning.
