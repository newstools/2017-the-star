The Kenya Electricity Transmission Company will establish two substations in Siaya county to end the perennial power outrages. The company will build substations in Bondo and Ndigwa, Rarieda subcounty, amd complete Rang’ala substation in Ugunja constituency to increase the voltage. Ketraco has contracted a consultancy firm to undertake an environmental impact assessment.  “The endeavour to end power outages in Siaya will be accomplished through 132 substations at Bondo and Ndigwa, whose construction will start early January,” Godfrey Kariuki, the corporate planning manager, said on Friday. The project will run for three years and will lead to more power being delivered to Siaya and its environs through the Rangala-Siaya-Bondo line.
