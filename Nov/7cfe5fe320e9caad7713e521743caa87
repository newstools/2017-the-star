A Garissa court on Wednesday acquitted former county boss Nathif Jama of illegally hiring seven ambulances at Sh600,00 a month each. Garissa chief magistrate Cosmas Maundu dismissed the case, citing witness contradictions and “weak and contradictory evidence”.  Jama and six members of the tendering committee were accused by the EACC of pocketing funds from the irregular leasing in 2014. The case created an uproar.  Addressing his supporters afterward, Nathif said, “We knew that the charges were fabricated and malicious.”  During the trial, former county medical services director Abbey Sheikh testified that leasing from the Kenya Red Cross was the best option since there was a health crisis. “We needed ambulances like yesterday. Mothers and children were dying like antelopes in the bush,” Sheikh said. “Leasing was the easiest and convinient way to address the crisis.” Nathif was charged alongside Rahma Dekow, Jawahir Keinan, Abdi Sahal, Safia Mohamed, Mohamed Hassan and Mohamud Mohamed.
