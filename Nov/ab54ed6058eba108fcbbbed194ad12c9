The Italian Community in Kenya has begun documenting
their historical ties to Kenya, which
dates back to over a century ago. Already a documentary has been produced by one of Italian’s
famous film maker Giampaolo Montesanto, who was assigned by the Italian Cultural
Institute. It shows how the Italians first settled in the Kenyan highlands, doing mission work and farming. It also explains how Italians came to dominate Malindi
after Kenya and Italy agreed to do space research at the San Marco Project in Ngomeni. Those featured include former San Marco manager Franco Esposito. Annemaria Petizozzi from the ICI said the documentary would be showcased at the Michale Joseph Centre in Nairobi on November 10 and 11.
