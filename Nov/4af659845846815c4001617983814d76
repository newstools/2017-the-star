Jubilee MPs from pastoralist communities have taken their differences to the National Assembly over the recent killing of cattle in Laikipia by police.  The MPs clashed before session Speaker Soipan Tuya over the shooting that occurred on Wednesday last week in Olmoran, Laikipia.  Kajiado East MP Peris Tobiko told the House police committed economic sabotage against the pastoralist communities.  Reports  indicated that more than 300 cows were shot.  But Laikipia county commissioner Onesmus Musyoki has disputed the figure, saying only 75 animals were killed in crossfire. “We are going through pain and trauma as pastoralists. This is like uprooting coffee or tea in Central Kenya. It is hurting to lose such a huge number of livestock through bullets. It is unthinkable and unimaginable,” Tobiko said.  But Laikipia West MP Patrick Mariru said armed herders from neighbouring counties have over the years been invading private farms.  Mariru said 50 people, including six policemen, had died and 80 others were injured  by herdsmen.  “This issue has been going on for many years. It is good that it has found its way into this House. Why do the herders look for pastures, while armed with guns? Who will speak for those small-scale farmers who have suffered at the hands of the herders?” he asked.
