The coffee harvest season is here and, concerned about theft, the government plans to offer security escorts to farmers transporting the beans from the factory to millers. For many years, coffee theft has taken place in factories and while in transit to millers, and farmers bear the brunt as this reduces their income. Agriculture PS Richard Lesiyampe yesterday said the government is collaborating with security agencies and cooperative societies to help curb theft. “We will also be talking to county governments where coffee is grown to build modern storage facilities for farmers. Cooperative societies should also mobilise resources in order to put up infrastructure and install CCTVs to monitor,” he said. Grenville Melli, the interim head of the Coffee Directorate in the Agriculture and Food Authority said cooperative societies should liaise with county security agents when marketing coffee. “They should also take insurance cover for the coffee, both in store and in transit, vet workers and the watchmen before employment in cooperative societies. There should be controlled access to the factory premises and storage facilities and avoid storing excessive quantities of coffee in the store without taking to the millers. Install CCTVs and motion detectors and have water-tight service agreements with service providers,” he said in a statement. According to statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture, in 2016 coffee farmers lost 465 bags of clean coffee worth more than Sh10 million. The ministry blamed millers and marketers for the losses and warned it would withdraw licenses for any player implicated in coffee theft. The Millers and Marketing Association denied the claims, saying registered value chain players are guided by a code of ethics. “Before we take coffee, it has to be booked first...” Martin Ngare, the secretary, said.
