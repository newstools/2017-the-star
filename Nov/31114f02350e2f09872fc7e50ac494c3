Garissa county commissioner James Kianda has sought to allay fears of violence as the KCPC exam enters its second day today. Kianda yesterday said security had been strengthened in all border towns to ensure candidates sitting the examinations are secure. There had been fears that militants from neighbouring Somalia could attack schools and disrupt the examinations. Areas bordering the Boni Forest had been listed as hotspots. They include Kulan, Damajaley, Amuma, Bodhai and parts of Hulugho. “We have confirmed that all examination materials reached their destinations and that all papers started in time in every centre,” Kianda said. A total of 5,272 candidates, including 1,362 refugees, are sitting the exams in 168 centres. The refugees are from Daghaley, Hagadhera, Ifo I and Ifo II camps in Dadaab. “Insecurity-prone areas along the border have all been secured.  “We have put in place arrangements to ensure an environment conducive to exam-taking prevails,” Kianda said.  Heavy rains last week rendered some roads impassable. Ballot papers for last week’s repeat presidential election had to be airlifted to polling stations. Kianda said the roads had become passable and no exam materials had to be airlifted. He warned both candidates and residents against cheating that could undermine the fairness and quality of the examination. “The message is very clear. We will not condone any malpractice, even in terms of management of exams. Those who might be tempted to do it will be dealt with decisively,” Kianda said. Because of the proximity to Somalia, the military escorted examination materials to some centres, an education official who requested anonymity, told the Star.  Some 1,003,556 candidates are sitting the examinations in 28,566 centres countrywide.
