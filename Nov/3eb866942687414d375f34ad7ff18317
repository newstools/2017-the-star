Migori boda boda riders yesterday burnt down a second truck within days after another accident left one of them dead in Awendo. Kokuro centre riders using the Migori-Kisii highway burnt down the Tanzania-bound vehicle after it hit and killed their colleague — Ouma Olum, 20. Enoch Rangile said the rider died on the spot and the driver parked the vehicle and attempted to ran away. “A matatu that was ahead blocked his way, but he managed to cling onto a tractor and ran away,” he said. Rangile said they burnt the lorry because the driver left “after Olum’s brain was strewn all over the road”.  Awendo police took the body to Rapcom Hospital mortuary, after the driver alerted them. On Monday, the riders burnt another lorry that killed another colleague.
