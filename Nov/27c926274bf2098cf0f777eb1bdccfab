Saumu Mbuvi, the daughter of Nairobi city boss Mike Sonko, is the latest victim of cyberbullying. The mother of one parted ways with her baby daddy businessman Ben Gatu. Saumu said it was because, "I was never married in the first place. I'm just a woman who realised my worth before it was too late. Yes we broke up. I'm just too young to go through such bullshit of a man moving from one politician's daughter to another for his selfish benefit." A troll using the name Japhary Jumaz posted a mean comment on her Instagram photo saying, "No wonder that man (Ben Gatu) made away from you." Saumu responded, "@japharyjumaz What does a man leaving me or my personal decisions have to do with politics...we are one now focussed on peace and working hard for a better future. My mistakes are Mine to learn....God has better plans for me! Kenya is for us and the future generations. Let peace be our language."
