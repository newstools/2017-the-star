We support the pilot project at the Abakore Health Centre in Wajir whereby the birth certificates of newborn babies are not being released until they complete immunisation.  The project is meant to create awareness on the importance of vaccination. The six critical vaccines that must be administered to babies in the first nine months of life include polio, tetanus, measles, BCG, influenza and pneumonia. Although a bit dictatorial, this is a good idea. We recommend that the birth certificates be prepared at birth and shown to the parents, so they know they are there, ready to be collected at the end of the vaccinations. Pastoralist communities are at great risk of disease, and many ailments are preventable.  The last occurrence of polio was in an area of Somalia near Kenya, and Kenyans do not want polio making a return. We also recommend that other hospitals in other counties with nomadic communities should borrow this good idea and example. It is in everyone’s interest, including the national and county interest.
