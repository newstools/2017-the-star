Residents of Wairi village, Kangema subcounty yesterday morning lynched a 19-year-old woman who stabbed a man to death. Salome Wambui is alleged to have stabbed 23-year-old Kennedy Murimi twice in
the chest, killing him on the spot. The two long time friends had a disagreement over a phone, which Murimi had sold
Wambui a week ago. According to neighbours, Wambui had paid Sh800 and had a balance of Sh200 to clear. Murimi wanted the phone back, since Wambui had delayed payment.Murimi’s mother Fresia Nyambura said she heard neighbours screaming at 6.30
am. She woke up and find her son had been killed. "When I got out of my house, I was shocked to find my last born son
lying in a pool of blood," Nyambura said. He was killed only 10m away from my house, she said. Nyambura said the girl spent the night at Murimi's cousin's house, whom she works with. Witnesses said the deceased were seen having a conversation before Wambui stabbed Murimi twice. A neighbour, who sought anonymity, said the Wambui came armed with a knife at Murimi's cousin's house. Previously, Murimi and Wambui were seen together during burial preparations for a neighbour. Kangema OCPD Cosmas Wachang'oka said he received a report about the incidence from members of the public.  "By the time we got to the scene, the two were already dead,"
Wachang'oka said. The police boss said Wambui was lynched by residents after killing Murimi. He said the two have been friends for a long time, and neighbours
were shocked by the turn of events. "We have established the disagreement was over a phone. Their
bodies have been taken to Murang'a County Hospital Mortuary for
postmortem," Wachang'oka  said.
