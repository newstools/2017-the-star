Gender CS Sicily Kariuki has condemned gender-based violence and called it barbaric. She wants victims offered moral support and culprits punished. Kariuki spoke yesterday when she visited a victim of violence at Nairobi Women’s Hospital’s Gender Violence Recovery Centre in Hurlingham. The victim was gang-raped by thugs on Friday during chaos that broke out in the city. Her M-Pesa shop was looted and all her belongings violently taken away. Her discomfort prompted her to request that male doctors, who had accompanied the CS and female medics, leave the room. Kariuki visited to offer moral support. “I regret the situation that happened on Friday on Jogoo Road where the woman was gang-raped. I extend my deepest sympathy to the victim and family members,” she said. “My ministry will work closely to monitor the situation to ensure accountability and support to her.”
