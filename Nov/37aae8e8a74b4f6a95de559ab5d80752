Market traders at Muthurwa, Kariokor and Marikiti are suffering next to a rain-fed pool of filthy, stagnant water. The rains have worsened the long-standing problem of bad and blocked drainage. Residents expressed fear of waterborne diseases. Roads are virtually impassable and the markets are inaccessible to both traders and customers. Starehe MP Charles Njagua, on Wednesday called on county and national governments to instal proper drainage. Markets have been facing difficulty in waste disposal. Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko launched Operation Ng’arisha Jiji to restore some of Nairobi’s lost glory. “These roads are impassable, especially during this rainy season. We need proper sanitation and drainage for traders,” Njagua said. The lawmaker was accompanied by Kura director general Silas Kinoti and Public Works Principal Secretary Mwangi Maringa.
