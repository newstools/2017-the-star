Agro Chemicals head coach Paul Ogai and his assistant Joseph Ongoro have been fired barely six months after assuming office following poor results in the National Super League. The sacking follows a recent 5-0 thumping at the hands of Wazito and a 4-1 drubbing from Modern Coast Rangers. The former Palos’ tactician was appointed to steer the Muhoroni-based side in May alongside his counterpart, who was plucked from the already relegated SportPesa Premier League side, Muhoroni Youth. Their inability to evade the looming danger of being dropped and the heavy defeats at a time they needed victory most necessitated their sacking. The former Kenyan Premier League sits 18th on a 19-team log with 27 points garnered from 34 matches same as Administration Police, who have a better goal difference and have played a match less. If AP overcome Nairobi City Star, Agro will be dismissed from the NSL. The management of the club arrived on the decision to relieve Ogai and his assistant off his duties owing to the intermittent dismal performance. “We have parted ways with Ogai and Ongoro as the club is currently in the relegation zone. When we appointed ogai, he was given a free hand to sign players and was offered all the required support. We pay salaries on time but unfortunately the performance has been poor,” said a letter from the club’s management. The club is set to appoint an interim coach to take charge for the remaining two matches.
