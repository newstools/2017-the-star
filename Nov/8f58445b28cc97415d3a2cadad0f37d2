The High Court in Kisii yesterday ordered the expunging of unmarked documents filed by a petitioner in an election petition challenging the victory of Bomachoge Chache MP Alfah Miruka. Justice Winfridah Okwany allowed prayers from the lawyers representing Miruka, the IEBC and a returning officer of striking out similar documents from sworn affidavit of the petitioner’s chief agent Ben Mayaka. Lawyers Okong’o Omogeni for petitioners Jeremiah Matoke and Christine Ollando who is representing, the IEBC and the returning officer on Monday said the unmarked documents that are not certified by the commission of oaths are inadmissible.  Okwany warned the petitioner against relying on the documents which were expunged. By press time, Matoke was being cross-examined by Omogeni.
