The Huduma Mashinani initiative under the Public Service ministry has been honoured in Morocco for improving services to its citizens. Huduma Mashinani is a citizen-centered mobile outreach programme through which government agencies provide their services in each county. It brings frequently used services to Kenyans at the grassroots, using the popular Huduma Centre model. They include services offered by the NYS, the Women’s Enterprise Fund, the Youth Enterprise Fund and the Uwezo Fund, which expand access to services for economic growth. The initiative came second to a programme launched in Rwanda at an African Association for Public Administration and Management event. CS Sicily Kariuki received a trophy at her office from Huduma Kenya Programme CEO Dennis Mutuku. She said the government is working on a strategy to reengineer service provision. “A radical approach to transform the civil service to make it as effective as the Huduma Kenya philosophy is the direction the country needs,” she said.
