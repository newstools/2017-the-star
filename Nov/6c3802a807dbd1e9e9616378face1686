Attorney General Githu Muigai has been enjoined in a case over a land dispute involving retired President Daniel Moi. The Samburus sued Moi for transferring more than 17,105 acres of “our land” in Laikipia county to the Kenya Wildlife Service for Sh400 million in 2011 and later to the Africa Wildlife Foundation, without considering their fate. The Environment Court in Nyeri allowed the AG to be included after the community filed a contempt of court application against KWS director general Kitili Mbathi and Laikipia county police commander Simon Kipkeu. Through lawyer Suyianka ole Lempaa, the community wants the two government officials and Ngare Ng’iro police station boss Roy Mwaura cited in contempt for defying court orders. On July 31, the court stopped the eviction of members of the community from the parcel, after they appealed a judgment that required them to leave. This was after a judge in June dismissed the community’s petition to stop the transfer of ownership. Lempaa said KWS rangers and police officers evicted the community forcibly, despite having been barred by the court. “The community suffered irreparable damage as their rights to housing, dignity and property were violated and jeopardised. During the illegal and forced eviction, KWS rangers and police violated the community’s rights. Even vulnerable groups like women and children were made homeless and exposed to the vagaries of the weather,” he said on Wednesday. The case will proceed on February 20 next year, when the Attorney General (pictured) is expected to reply to the claims of forced eviction.
