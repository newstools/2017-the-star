NASA has written to police requesting security for peaceful demonstrations on November 10. In a letter seen by The Star on Wednesday, lawyer Edwin Sifuna said the march is part of their "quest for justice". "The protests will be within Nairobi as part of its quest for electoral justice and an end to electoral impunity in Kenya," he said. Sifuna, who lost the Nairobi senator seat, asked city commander Japheth Koome to provide security so criminal elements do not interfere with their activity. "Your cooperation towards making the peaceful demonstration a success, in line with your responsibilities, will be appreciated," NASA principal Raila Odinga's supporters have repeatedly protested against election results and the electoral agency saying reforms must be implemented so the process is secured for posterity. The Supreme Court cancelled the August 8 poll over "irregularities and illegalities" and Raila pulled out citing lack of reforms at IEBC. Following the annulment, he was to face President Uhuru Kenyatta once again on October 26.  Uhuru won 98 per cent votes in the repeat election whose turnout was 38.84 per cent. Opposition leader Raila Odinga pulled out of the presidential election saying the results had been pre-determined. Other than protests, during which at least 51 people have been killed since August, the Opposition leader asked his supporters to stop using Safaricom products. He claimed the firm influenced the presidential election but the telecommunications giant has denied claims it was involved in rigging. Supporters are also to boycott Brookside Dairy and Bidco.
