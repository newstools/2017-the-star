Upcoming artiste Jerry Ogallo is currently ruling the airwaves with the song Main Chik, a song he featured legendary singer Bamboo. But what fans don't understand is whether the Compe hitmaker has backslid or not after announcing that he has turned over a new leaf. Talking exclusively to Word Is, Ogallo said, "My producer organised our meeting, Bamboo heard me sing and he told me we should instead do a collabo." He added, "He
is a gospel artiste, our song is all about love, I can't see any
contradiction, he is just fine. The likes of Shusho have done love songs
and no one talks about them. It's just love. If he talked about beer and
drugs, that would be a problem, but he is simply talking about love." When asked if Bamboo ever spoke to him about the allegatios of saying some artistes are illuminati, the uprising star said they have been having different opinions, but are still friends. "It is normal for people to have their own opinion, but a good song is a good song, sioni ubaya. He
is entitled to his opinion, acha ajibambe, I have my different opinion,
I don't mean I agree with him, but everyone has their own opinion, which
should be respected. We don't agree on everything, and that doesn't
mean we are not friends." So, is he dating? "Hakuna side chicks, the song is about the woman of my dreams, the woman who makes my heart skip a beat.There's a woman I'm chasing after but hajaingia box bado." Ogallo added, "I cannot resist the woman I love, not because of a politician, I can never resist the woman of my dreams."
