Western Stima’s hopes of survival in the SportPesa Premier league took a hit after they were beaten 2-1 by incoming champions Gor Mahia. It had started all so well for Stima when they took the lead from the spot in the 18th minute through Vincent Omumbo. But the champs keen to avenge their first leg loss against the same side in the first leg turned on the style and completed what was in the end a comfortable run. Francis Kahata levelled in the 26th minute before a free-kick from Ugandan Godfrey Walusimbi shortly before halftime buried Stima’s hopes. Thika United questions for survival got a shot in the arm yesterday as they pipped Sony Sugar by a solitary goal at Ruaraka yesterday. Once again it was Nigerian striker Inwudu Chibueze who came up with the gods, dispatching the winner past Sony custodian Kelvin Otieno midway through the first half. The win improved Thika’s tally to 32 points with three matches left to play and left Sony also looking over their shoulders with trepidation as they have 35 points. A goal in each half from strikers Lawrence Juma and Brian Yakhama helped Nzoia United see off AFC Leopards 2-0 and consolidate their position in the top half of the table. The victory for Nzoia saw them move to seventh in the table with 43 points above Kariobangi Sharks on goal difference after the latter came away with a 1-1 draw against Ulunzi Stars, who are sixth with 44 points. Outgoing champions Tusker also drew 1-1 away at Chemelil Sugar. Meanwhile, Posta Rangers last minute rennaisance continued as they defeated Kakamega Homeboyz 1-0 to leapfrog their victims in the battle for the top three. Kennedy Agogo Otieno was the toast for the mailmen, netting the clincher 20 minutes from time to break the Homeboyz hearts. With three games to go, Rangers are fourth with 49 points with Mike Mururi’s men slipping to fifth, a point further back.
