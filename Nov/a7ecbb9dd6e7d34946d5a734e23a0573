The Technical University of Mombasa is having its fifth graduation today amid fears of missing names. But vice chancellor Laila Abubakar said the affected students will be given “award letters” because “graduation is just a ceremony”. “With the letter, you can get the job anywhere,” she said on the phone on Tuesday. Abubakar said the list of graduands was posted on the university website two months ago. She said students scurried at the last minute. Senate Board of Examiners sat twice to effect changes after missing names were brought to their attention, Abubakar said. “But since the chairman of the board is out of the country, he could not come for the third time over the same issue,” she said. It is the same board that supported the issuance of award letters with the backing of the university council. The number of graduands has been souring since 2013. This year is 2,043. Fourteen graduands will be awarded Master’s degree, Bachelor (1,076), Higher Diploma (17), Diploma (775) and Certificate (161). As a result, the VC said they are contemplating having two graduations per academic year.
