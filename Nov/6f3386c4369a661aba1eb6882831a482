Education PS Belio Kipsang has urged politicians and citizens to allow form four students to sit their final Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education examination without interference. Kipsang said the political environment might not be conducive to allow the 615,772 students, who have prepared for the last four years, to sit their exams peaceful. NASA leaders have called for the boycott of products associated with the ruling Jubilee government. Speaking at the Coast regional headquarters at Uhuru na Kazi Building, where he had gone to witness the opening of the examination containers, Kipsang said the electioneering period should come to an end. “We as Kenyan adults had our time during the elections. I now urge the adults, for the next 23 days, to give our children a conducive environment to sit their examinations,” Kipsang said. At the Coast, some 35,072 boys and girls are sitting their KCSE examinations.
