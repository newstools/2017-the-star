Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe should be removed as the country's leader and as first secretary of the ruling Zanu-PF party. This is what Victor Matemadanda, Secretary-General of Zimbabwe’s War Veterans Association said on Wednesday. Matemadanda added at a news conference that a military takeover earlier on Wednesday was for the good of Zimbabwe.  France said it was closely following events in Zimbabwe and stressed respect for constitutional law. "We reiterate our attachment to constitutional law and respect of the legitimate aspirations of the Zimbabwean people," French foreign ministry spokeswoman, Agnes Romatet-Espagne said during a daily media briefing. "We encourage all parties to find a peaceful solution within this framework and without violence." It is not clear whether the apparent military coup will bring a formal end to Mugabe's rule. Zimbabwe's military said the 93-year-old leader and his family were safe. Britain Prime Minister Theresa May called on all sides to show restraint in Zimbabwe and said the situation remains fluid. "We are monitoring those developments very carefully, the situation is still fluid and we urge restraint on all sides," May said in parliament. Read: Coup? What coup?
