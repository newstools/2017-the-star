A rescue team, investigators and police have intensified the search for the bodies of three people aboard a plane that crashed into Lake Nakuru. Forty divers have extended their search to bushes along the shores and in the waters. Two bodies were retrieved a fortnight ago. The plane crashed on October 21. National Disaster Operation Centre desk officer Jonathan Kertich yesterday said the divers have combed most areas of the lake, including the northern side, where witnesses said the plane could have crashed. He said that the team is now concentrating on the southern side along the shores and on the nearby dry land. Kertich said high levels of siltation, dirt in the lake and the heavy rains have made the search difficult. “The water is seven metres deep... but divers have managed to go down to the bottom of the lake using sophisticated machines, including equipment from the Navy and two magnetometers from the Geothermal Development Company,” he said.
