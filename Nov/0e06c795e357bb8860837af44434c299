Two women are nursing wounds after they were allegedly arrested and beaten up by AP officers in Kitui over alleged offensive conduct. They were arrested on Wednesday night after a local pastor reported to the police that they had insulted him.  The incident was recorded in the Occurrence Book at the Kitui police station as number 60/1/11/2017. When reporters visited the women at Syungila, one of the complainants, Irene Kambua, claimed the pastor framed them for the APs to beat them up for abandoning his church. Kitui county AP commander Benson Wasike said on Sunday the two women had filed a complaint with the Kitui police station OCS, but later withdrew it. “The matter has been closed because we cannot pursue a complaint that has already been withdrawn,” Wasike said. He said the APs mentioned in the case had intervened to help resolve a domestic quarrel, but were mistaken as having been party to the beatings. “We advised the affected parties to take the matter to the chief,” Wasike said. The Syungila incident comes only months after a Kyuso court, Kitui county, sentenced an assistant county commissioner and two APs for torturing a suspect under arrest. The culprits were based at the Mivukoni DO’s camp in Kyuso. In June, APs stationed at the Kamuwongo DO’s camp allegedly arrested and beat up a journalist’s farm hand. The incident was recorded at Kyuso police station.
