After being hit by deferment hurdles which were linked to the unease political situation in the country, the 15th edition of the Standard Chartered Nairobi Marathon finally swings into action tomorrow within the capital amid the remolding of the route and increased of prize money. The Local Organizing Committee chairman Peter Gitau said entries have mostly attracted runners from Rift Valley.  “This year we have a very heavy presence of athletes from Nandi, Kericho, Elgeyo Marakwet and Uasin Gishu counties. Our decision to work with coaches and county officials has heightened interest among athletes within those regions,” said Gitau. Fireworks are expected to reign when defending male champion Joshua Kipkorir lines up to defend his crown from the more than 200 elite runners who have affirmed their participation in this year’s edition. Since winning the 2015 race in Nairobi, Kipkorir has posted impressive results winning the Wuson and Tiemen races in China and coming second in the Standard Chartered Mumbai Marathon in India. Other athletes to watch include last year’s second runners up Hillary Kiplimo who had an impressive outing in China earlier this year posting 2:14:00 and Arnold Kibet who has recorded impressive performances on the road in Italy this year.  The highlight of the 42km women’s race will be Mercy Jemutai who recently posted an impressive 2:31 time in China. Following the route molding which was necessitated by the closure of Nyayo National Stadium for renovations, the starting and end point has consequently been moved to Railway Club and motorists have been advised to avoid Mombasa Road, Uhuru Highway, Upper Hill, Forest Road and sections of Haile Selassie as they would remain inaccessible for the better part of tomorrow.  The order of events will see the 21km Wheelchair race open the proceedings at 6:50am before the full marathon takes off  minutes later.  The half marathon will kick off at 7:20am and 10km race will follow at 8:30am.
