Jubilee women in Kakamega have criticised the county assembly for passing the motion approving a People’s Assembly. Led by Mercy Luseno, they urged MCAs to resign because they are not representing the wishes of residents. NASA is pushing for assemblies in counties, as well as a national People’s Assembly to discuss governance issues and press for electoral justice.  Luseno said on Wednesday the People’s Assembly amounts to MCAs relinquishing their responsibilities and allowing people to represent themselves. The electorate already takes care of MCAs’ salaries through taxes and does not deserve to be burdened with other roles, they said. The women said they will consider moving to court to have the MCAs removed from their positions.
