A boda boda operator who allegedly murdered his neighbour was stabbed on Wednesday night and his body burned by his colleagues. Michael Juma was attacked in Aber village, Bondo, at around 11 pm. "The angry boda-boda operators gouged out his eyes and stabbed him in the stomach. They then poured petrol on the body and set it ablaze," said a witness who did not want to be named.

He said the boda boda rider committed the crime with accomplices. Area chief Patrick Obilo said the attackers began by storming a home they thought was Juma's. “The group surrounded the home demanding that the owner produce Juma. They threatened to set the house on fire but they were informed that Juma's house was a stone's throw away." The chief said that after the mob justice, the attackers dumped what was left of Juma's body at his mother’s doorstep and fled. Obilo cautioned members of the public, especially youths, against taking matters into their own hands instead of involving police. Bondo OCPD Paul Kiarie said the body was taken to Bondo sub-county hospital mortuary and investigations launched.
