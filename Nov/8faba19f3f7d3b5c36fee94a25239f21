The Lamu county commissioner’s office has launched a campaign to unite farmers and herders embroiled in a feud over pasture. County commissioner Gilbert Kitiyo will lead the campaign, which will involve other top security chiefs, including Lamu police commander Muchangi Kioi and AP commander Joseph Kigen. The committee has toured Hindi, Mpeketoni and Witu divisions, where the fights are said to be out of control. Addressing residents of Maisha Masha in Witu yesterday, the security bosses urged residents to explore alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. Herders graze their livestock on people’s farms, while farmers retaliate by attacking and injuring the livestock with pangas, resulting in a cycle of conflicts between the two sides.
