Former Kasipul MP Oyugi Magwanga has told the High Court that he won the Homa Bay governor race by over 50,000 votes. Magwanga has lined up 22 witnesses to testify in an election petition challenging the re-election of governor Cyprian Awiti. He wants the court to nullify Awiti's re-election citing several irregularities, bribery, threats to his agents during the August 8 elections. The ex-legislator has petitioned Awiti, his deputy Hamilton Orata, County returning officer Michaels Kosgei and the IEBC. Magwanga told the court that the 37A forms that were issued by the IEBC varied from the ones the electoral body presented before the court. During a cross-examination by the IEBC advocate Fredrick Orego, two parties presented two different copies of the forms bearing different serial numbers. Some of the forms which were presented to Magwanga's agents were blank while others had no IEBC stamps.  The court was also told some forms did not have the names and signatures of the constituency returning officers and their deputies. Orego, however, put him to task to explain how the few blank forms could make him the winner. "My lord that is why I am here, this actually shows that your client did a shoddy job and apart from the blank forms." "...there are numerous pieces of evidence in the affidavits which will be unveiled at the correct time," Magwanga said.  Magwanga is being represented by Charles Kanjama of Muma and Kanjama Advocates.
