Maize traders are currently buying the commodity from Uganda at Sh1,600 less than the market price of a 90kg bag in Kenya. The traders are making a lot of money and denying Kenyan farmers an opportunity to sell at the local market prices. According to the daily data provided by the Eastern Africa Grain Council, the price of a 90kg bag of maize in Kenya is currently selling at Sh3,600. In Uganda, the same bag of maize is going for Sh1,975. “Uganda has harvested and there is surplus of maize hence the low price. There is currently a lot of cross-border trade in Busia with large volumes of grains coming from Uganda into Kenya," a source from EAGC said. This is despite the fact that large-scale millers in Kenya do not prefer maize from Uganda, because it is highly mixed up compared to hybrid varieties. But on the contrary, the Agriculture ministry commodity prices indicates the average price of a 90kg bag of maize is selling at Sh3,100, which is Sh100 less than the Sh3,200 price the government is offering farmers. The government is currently buying a 90kg bag from farmers at Sh3,200, hoping to buy all the 2017-18 long rains season harvest to replenish the National Strategic Grain Reserve. In Mombasa, a bag of maize is selling at Sh2,970, Sh3,150 in Kisumu, Sh2,493 in Nakuru and Sh2,700 in Eldoret. The Regional Agricultural Trade Intelligence Network complied by the EAGC also indicated the price of maize in Burundi is the highest within the East Africa selling at a high of Sh6,088, while in Tanzania the price is at Sh2,908. The EAGC attributed the high cost of maize in Burundi to low production and fluctuation of the local country’s currency. The grain council, however, warned that Burundi may not provide a good market for Kenyan maize traders. This is because of logistical and regulatory issues that may create a barrier to the trading of maize.   “Kenyan maize traders can only consider selling to Burundi if doing business would make economic sense,” the source said.
