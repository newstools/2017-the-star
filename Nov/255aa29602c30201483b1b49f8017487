Kitui is looking for a tourism ambassador to market the county as an ideal destination for visitors, Tourism executive Koki Musau said yesterday. Speaking to journalists at a Kitui hotel, Musau said the ambassador will be identified during a Miss Kitui pageant to be held in December. “The pageant will identify the best ambassador as far as promotion and marketing of tourism is concerned,” Musau said. Musau said the county is committed to positioning itself as a vibrant tourist destination. It will promote and market its tourism products to attract visitor. “Pageantry provides a platform where ambassadors speak about their counties on a national platform,” Musau said. The audition will be held in all the eight subcounties before representatives participate in a grand final to pick the winner. Musau asked youths to apply to participate in the contest.
