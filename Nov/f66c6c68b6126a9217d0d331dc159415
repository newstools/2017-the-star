Transport was disrupted on the Kapenguria-Kitale road on Tuesday when after matatu drivers barricaded the highway for more than seven hours to protest against high taxes charged by West Pokot county government. Hundreds of passengers were stranded in Makutano and Kitale towns. Private vehicles were also caught up in the protest and owners had to wait for hours before Trade executive Monges Lotodo intervened and requested the matatu operators to open up the road. Monges said the former county government increased the levy from Sh1,500 to Sh,2500, without following procedures or talking to matatu operators. “I have ordered the revenue collectors to charge the matatus Sh70 per trip from today,” he said. Matatu driver Sande John said the county government charges them Sh2,500 per vehicle a month. He said they are unable to raise this amount. Sande said they wrote to the county, complaining of high charges, but no one has responded. He said the county government has been reluctant to address their pleas and by staging a protest they hope the county government will address their issues.  “We want the county government to charge us Sh70 per trip. We are against the Sh2,500 per month, because there are few customers along the route. It is difficult to make three trips per day to and from Kitale,” he said. Tout Abraham Olelempak said a matatu requires many documents before it is allowed to operate and high charges leave their pockets empty. “The vehicle requires insurance, NTSA and revenue stickers, the vehicle also needs mechanical check-ups. All these services require money,” he said.
