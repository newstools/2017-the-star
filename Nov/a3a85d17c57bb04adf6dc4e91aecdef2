A Nairobi court yesterday directed the incitement-to-violence case against Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria be heard on February 14 next year. Kuria was charged with uttering words to the effect that “it wasdesirable to cause death and physical injury to certain persons in Kenya” while addressing a crowd in Gatundu Stadium on June 26, 2015. He denied the charge. Yesterday, Milimani senior principal magistrate Kennedy Cheruiyot gave the order after Kuria, through his lawyer, asked for adjournment, saying he had a sick child, whom he had to take to hospital. The prosecution, led by senior state counsel Duncan Ondimu, did not object to the defence application, but informed the court he was ready to proceed with two witnesses.  He is alleged to have been urging the youth to attack politicians opposed to NYS projects. Earlier, on November 26, 2014, the prosecution had asked the court to restrain Kuria from making statements that amount to violence and ethnic contempt. The prosecution also said that despite Kuria’s release on Sh2 million cash bail, “he had continued with the same conduct that now forms the subject matter before the court.” However,  Kuria’s lawyer said the case was “politically driven”. Kuria was later granted Sh1 million bond and warned not to make further inciteful remarks.
