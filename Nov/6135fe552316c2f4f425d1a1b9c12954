As I approached a rocky section of road, I noticed quite a few impala and zebra bending down and seemingly “licking the sand”, and from a distance, it actually looks like they are “drinking”, as the bending action looks exactly the same. It was interesting to note that even the calves were copying the adults. So why do they go through the effort to do this? Simply speaking, they need mineral nutrition, and in places where the plant food they eat is lacking minerals, various species of animals seek out places where they can get minerals. A mineral lick (also known as a salt lick) is a place where animals can go to lick essential mineral nutrients from a deposit of salts and other minerals. Mineral licks can be naturally occurring (natural licks) or artificial (such as blocks of salt that farmers place in pastures for livestock to lick). Natural licks provide the biometals (sodium, calcium, iron, phosphorus, zinc, and trace elements) required for bone, muscle and other growth in wildlife, such as elephants and many herbivore species. Such licks are especially important in ecosystems with poor general availability of nutrients. It is thought that certain fauna can detect calcium in salt licks. Mankind is mostly spoilt, as we just need to go to a store (like a supermarket) to buy our salt and minerals, spices, but animals seem to sense where the “natural” stores are and can walk long distances at times to benefit from nutrients. So while we all need water for life, there are also times when animals need “minerals for life!”. So next time you see animals seeming to drink the earth, you will know they are actually “licking for life!”
