More than 200 women in Samburu county have benefitted from a Sh1 million project meant to introduce them to small-scale local businesses as an alternative way of generating income. The women, who have been engaging in harmful cultural practices like FGM and marrying off their girls at an early age to earn income are now turning to livestock markets and bead making. The women have formed groups and they have been taken through training on how to operate businesses. The project was initiated by World Vision three years ago with an aim of financially uplifting women to enable them assist their families. “This programme has helped us eradicate poverty. We have learnt a lot that even a woman can be depended upon as the breadwinner for her family,” resident Sarah Lalaikipian said. Beneficiary Paskaline Leporiporit said the sheep she was given an year ago has given birth and helped her buy basic needs of her family. World Vision manager Jonathan Lepora said the institution has used Sh1 million to buy 200 sheep and beads, which were distributed to women in self-help groups for the purposes of businesses. “We want women to have income generating projects that would empower them to support their families financially,” he said. Lepora spoke in Kisima, Samburu Sentral subcounty, on Friday morning, where the organisation distributed 200 sheep and beads to 200 women organised in 12 self-help groups for the purposes of businesses.
