The Garissa government yesterday launched the Malezi Bora month, which aims to improve the health and nutrition status of women and children. Health executive Ahmednadhri Omar said it will include immunisation and deworming of children and vitamin A supplementation.  It will also include family planning services, antenatal care services and hospital deliveries for pregnant women. Others target areas include nutritional and health education, screening, treatment and referral on malnourished children, pregnant and lactating mothers. “This we know will improve child survival and development, as well as contribute to a county’s prosperity,” Omar said in Garissa town. The executive urged civil society groups, UN agencies and other partners to support an education campaign meant to support pregnant women to visit hospitals to get professional antenatal care and skilled birth delivery. This will not only reduce the risk of birth complications but also give women appropriate breastfeeding counsel and nutrition education, he said. “Good health is a prerequisite for rapid socio-economic development,” Omar said. “To this end, we will continue to invest in infrastructure and personnel, both in numbers and technical capacity.” The theme for this year’s Malezi Bora month is ‘Afya ya Jamii, Ustawi wa Nchi.’
