Auditor General Edward Ouko has raised the red flag over the debt of Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company. In a report on the company’s financial status for 2015-16, Ouku says the state corporation’s liabilities exceed its assets.  Thus, it is unable to meet its financial obligations. According to the report, the company’s liabilities stood at Sh4.2 billion as at the end of June 30, 2016 against assets of Sh3 billion — negative working capital of Sh1.1 billion. “This is an indication the company may be experiencing financial difficulties in settling maturing obligations as and when they fall due,” reads the report. The auditor cited the company’s inefficiency in billing for water produced, saying it lost Sh3.1 billion in revenue due to non-revenue water. The report, tabled in the county assembly on Tuesday, states that non-revenue water (unaccounted for water) increased by two per cent in 2015-16 compared to 2014-15. “During the year under review, the company produced 200,352,109 cubic metres of water but earned Sh4.7 billion only. “Out of this volume, 121,146,603 cubic metres only were billed to customers. The balance of 79,205,506 cubic metres or approximately 40 per cent of total produced water represents non-revenue water,” reads the report.  The company’s acting MD Nahashon Muguna declined to comment on the report, saying he had not yet read it.  The firm has blamed cartels for illegal connections and diversion of water, especially in the slums.  It has also blamed leaks from ageing water pipes for the losses.  But some residents have accused the company of poor maintenance of water pipes. Some also say the company harbours the alleged cartels.  The auditor said the firm’s current and non-current liabilities stood at Sh1.1 billion last year compared to Sh907.9 million the year before.
