A man who petitioned the Machakos county assembly vetting board to reject two executive nominees has been charged, together with his lawyer, with deceiving the assembly. Charles Kyalo is charged alongside his lawyer Alfred Muia yesterday.  They denied the charges and were each released on Sh80,000 bail. The two were charged with making a document without lawful authority to deceive the assembly vetting board on October 16.  They filed a petition against Naomi Mutie and Faith Wathome nominated for county executive positions.  Kyalo swore the affidavit which was stamped by his lawyer Muia.  It was later presented as forgery after the law firm which Muia purported to represent distanced itself from the document.  Both nominees were rejected by the county assembly. The case will be mentioned November 28.
