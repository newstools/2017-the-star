A 15-year-old girl was yesterday burnt to death after a house she was sleeping in was razed by fire.  Eny Mwende died yesterday morning after a tin lamp lit by her grandmother set the house on fire. Naomi Marigu said she lit the lamp and woke up Mwende before heading to the kitchen to prepare breakfast. The kitchen is separate from the main house. But Mwende never woke up and continued sleeping. Marigu said she did not realise her house was on fire until neighbours moved in to help. The neighbours said the fire spread so fast that they were unable to put it out. "We thought she was somewhere safe only to find her body burnt beyond recognition," neighbour Peter Kiragu said of Mwende. The incident happened in Embu North. Area police boss Mark Wanjala said they suspect the fire could have started from the tin lamp. Mwende sat for her KCPE exams early this month. Her body was taken to Embu Level Five Hospital Mortuary.
