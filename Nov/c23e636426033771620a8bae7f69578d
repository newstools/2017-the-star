David Mutwiwa was found guilty and convicted by Milimani senior principle magistrate Lawrence Mugambi. The accused had been charged that on March 11, 2014 at Taj Towers in Nairobi county, while impersonating an investigator of EACC, Mutwiwa represented himself toÂ  Silas Simiyu as an investigator of the commission and that he was investigating a corruption case at the premises. Mutwiwa was also convicted on another count of knowingly and fraudulently producing a forged staff identification card for EACC to Simiyu, alleging it to be genuine and issued by the anti-corruption agency.
