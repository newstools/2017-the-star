A last stage slip-up while crossing back to Kenya Tanzania saw Baldev Singh Chager surrender his lead on Day 6 of the Kenya Airways East African Safari Classic Rally. Chager, better known as Boldy, was among the drivers who wrongslotted on the 25km Lunga Lunga stage thus losing his lead Tuthill Porsche driver Richard Jackson. It was a bitter pill to swallow for Boldy, considering the Englishman was driving fl at-out all day to snatch his position. Boldy’s ‘bad day in the office’ follows another disappointing run by compatriot Carl ‘Flash’ Tundo who also surrendered his lead with reliability gremlins on the third day. Boldy, who was first on the road on Day 6, drove to safeguard a podium position with two second fastest stage times on the day’s run in Tanzania only to goof at CS15 Lunga Lunga. “We have had our share of problems on Day One and Day Two where we lost a lot of time and if it wasn’t for that we would have been in a good position right from the opening day. The Classic has really become a cat and mouse game where any slip ups can place you in a very tricky situation,” said Chager. Chager put in a protest to dispute his wrong-slot but lost out when officials stuck to their guns. Meanwhile, Ian Duncan and Onkar Rai have both kissed the rally goodbye with engine problems. Duncan bowed after Day Four and Onkar on the last stage of Day 6.
