The Nyeri county government, its offices and employees yesterday were rededicated to God. More than 30 clerics congregated at the offices for prayer at 9am, led by Bishop Paul Wanjohi of New Life Church. The bishops started the prayers at the gate and moved to every office, blessing them and sprinkling them with anointed oil. Wanjohi said the prayers were not a cleansing ceremony, but a rededication. Two elected Nyeri governors have died in office in a span of 10 months. Governor Nderitu Gachagua died on February 24 of pancreatic cancer in a London hospital. Governor Wahome Gakuru, 51, who had been in office for less than three months, died after a road accident last Tuesday. The clerics later blessed the new governor, Mutahi Kahiga, and his staff ahead of his swearing-in ceremony later in the afternoon. Kahiga, a teacher by profession, was sworn in at 3pm. He said the clerics are welcomed at the county headquarters anytime to hold prayers or meetings in the boardroom. “Our message was simple, to re-dedicate our county government to God. We wanted to increase faith and hope in our God,” Kahiga said. Curious wananchi followed the proceedings from a distance. Kirinyaga Deputy Governor Peter Ndambiri, who joined the clerics, said he supported the move to be closer to God. The swearing-in was attended by Uasin Gishu Senator Kipchumba Murkomen. Nyeri Senator Ephraim Maina urged leaders to work closely with the new governor. Other leaders present included Nyeri MPs Rigathi Gachagua, Ngunjiri Wambugu, Anthony Kiai, Kanini Kega, Rahab Mukami and Gichuhi Mwangi.
