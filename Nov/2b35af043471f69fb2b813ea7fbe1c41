Murang'a traders on Tuesday offered free food to customers and motorists to celebrate President Uhuru Kenyatta's swearing-in. Led by taxi operators and hawkers, the traders converged at a stage commonly known as 'bunge' and raised Sh25,000 which they used to but the food. It was cooked on the street and later served to locals and motorists. They prepared chapati's and fried potatoes with vegetable and beef stew. Motorists were stopped and offered the free food, although some gave money for the offer to continue. "We thought organising a feast was the most appropriate way to celebrate Uhuru's swearing in ceremony," said taxi operator Lawrence Mwangi. He said everyone was able to enjoy the day through the feast regardless of their financial status. Nominated MCA Stephen Chege and former Township MCA Charles Karina contributed towards the feast. Mwangi said the feast made it possible for all to enjoy the day regardless of their financial status. According to him, the traders approached local leaders for support but that the only support they recieved from was from nominated MCA Stephen Chege and former Township MCA Charles Karina. “We are however happy that we have been able to organize ourselves and provide food for all as our way of honoring our President and his deputy,” Mwangi said. The well-coordinated feast went on until dusk as locals ate to their fill.
