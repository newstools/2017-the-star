Former Rurii MCA Wahome Kamoche has criticised the Court of Appeal for overturning the High Court decision that would have led to former ward representatives pocketing close to Sh8 billion. He said the decision is a big blow to the former county legislators ,who have “heavy financial burdens”. Kamoche said the former MCAs will move to the Supreme Court to seek a constitutional interpretation. He said it is “clear an MCA’s term is five years and three days, while the terms of governors, MPs and senators are not specified”. Kamoche said, “We acquired 60-month loans and 60 months expires in March next year. It is unconstitutional and illegal for the Court of Appeal to rule we should not be paid.” He said involvement of the governors, senators and MPs in the matter was “illegal, irregular and unconstitutional”, given they were not party to the original suit filed at the High Court by the County Assembly Forum. ”If they were interested, they would have sought to join the original case as amicus curiae or interested parties,”  Kamoche said.
