Lamu woman MP Ruweida Obo (pictured) has launched a teacher-training programme for form four school leavers from the marginalised Boni community. The students will receive free training in teaching courses so they can revive learning in their villages. All five schools in Boni — Basuba, Milimani, Mangai, Mararani and Kiangwe primary schools — Lamu East, have remained closed for more than two years because of attacks blamed on al Shabaab. Teachers have fled. Obo yesterday said her office will spend about Sh1 million from the National Government Affirmative Action Fund to sponsor students to colleges so they can help.
