  He noted that it’s a tradition for by-elections to be held while officers are on terminal leave.  Sossion and Nzili have previously been entangled in leadership wrangles of the giant teachers’ union which have occasionally led to the duo taking contradictory stands during teachers’ strikes.  The Knut boss clarified that Nzili's exit plan was being executed in line with the Knut constitution which requires union officials to leave office upon attaining 60 years.  He said Nzili’s vice-chairman Samson Kaguma has also been sent on terminal leave ahead of his retirement on April 2 next year. Nzili will retire on May 16.  "Their positions shall be filled in a by-election during the 60th Annual Delegates Conference. Brother Wycliffe Etole Omucheyi shall assume office as the Acting National Chairman precisely on 16th November and preside over the 60th ADC," Sossion said.  Omucheyi is the second vice-chairman of the union.   He said officials in al KNUT branches countrywide must stick to the provision of the KNUT Constitution on retirement noting that their shall be no negotiations when one reaches the retirement age.  He said there have been historical incidents where some officials falsified documents to change their retirement ages.
