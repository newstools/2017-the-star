Kamkunji MP Yusuf Hassan has condemned NASA leaders for calling for resistance and boycott of certain products. He expressed concern on Saturday that the move might destroy the economy. “Safaricom, Brookside and Equity Bank have their outlets across the country and boycotting them is a step of dividing the country,” Hassan said at Happy Mary School in Eastleigh. Last week, MPs allied to the National Resistance Movement officially launched the boycott of products from companies they said support Jubilee. Equity was not one of the firms listed by the legislators. Companies listed included Safaricom, Bidco and Brookside. Hassan said elections have winners and losers and urged wananchi to move forward. He said those who do not agree with the presidential rerun results should use proper channels to have their grievances resolved, instead of relying on divisive tactics.
