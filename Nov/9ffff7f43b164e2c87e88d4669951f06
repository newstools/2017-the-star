Jubilee MCAs in Kwale have protested against the adoption of NASA's People's Assembly motion. The motion was passed on Wednesday evening following heated debate between ward representatives in the Opposition and the ruling Jubilee Party. The latter, who outnumbered their counterparts, stormed out of the assembly. Jubilee politician Mshenga Ruga said he will lead other Jubilee leaders in opposing the formation of a People's Assembly through court. Ruga said the People's Assembly is irrelevant to residents of Salim Mvurya's county. "Our main agenda as Kwale leaders should have been development. The People's Assembly will not solve any problems," he said. "By passing the motion, MCA's surrendered their responsibility to represent the people of Kwale. I will go to court to challenge it." He further said the People's Assembly will lead to unnecessary loss of public funds, which will encumber development.

He claimed NASA MCAs passed the motion out of fear they will be sacked should they not uphold the coalition's interests. The People's Assembly was sponsored by NASA despite a High Court order barring county assemblies from passing or adopting the motion. Jubilee's Nominated MCA Binti Kibamba said the county should focus on motions that will benefit locals. Kasemeni MCA Antony Yama said the motion violated  standing order 41 of the Kwale assembly.  However, NASA MCA's led by majority leader Joseph Ndeme (Mwavumbo), maintained their stand and supported the motion which they said will help fulfill roles that Jubilee leaders have been avoiding.
