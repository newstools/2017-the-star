The Kiambu executive will draft a Bill to compel investors, factories and industries to be employing 70 per cent people from the county, Governor Ferdinand Waititu has said. He it is a must that Kiambu people be given priority and he will not sit back and watch as residents are "denied job opportunities". "We are creating job opportunities for our youths in many fields, but as we do this, we will ensure we pass a law that businesses and investors must employ 70 per cent people from Kiambu," Waititu said. He spoke on Friday in Kiambaa constituency. Waititu said unemployment is a challenge in Kiambu and the law is meant to give the youth an opportunity. "The youths are coming everyday to my office to look for jobs. We will have industrial parks in Nachu and an agropark in Muguga. We will also revive the railway and industries in Thika to employ the youths," he said. He said they will also make another law to make it mandatory for national and extra-county schools in the area to reserve one class for students from Kiambu who have attained the required grades. The governor also said it is not fair that higher learning institutions in Kiambu county have employed less people from the county. "Go to the universities in Kiambu and you will find that only less than 10 per cent of residents have been employed in those institutions. If you go the institutions in other counties, you will find they have employed locals, but when I push for equal opportunities I'm branded tribal. It is time our people got their rights," Waititu said. The governor said he will ensure the heads of such institutions are recruited through the assembly and are selected from Kiambu.
