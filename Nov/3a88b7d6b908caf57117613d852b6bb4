Work on the roads and paths in Umoja has kicked off after continued floods making the roads impassable. The refurbishment kicked off on Monday with KURA emergency team starting off along Moi Drive in Umoja 1 estate which has been most affected. "As I promised the emergency team and contractor from KURA reported to work on Moi Drive to address the challenges we are facing. Today the team started working on the drainage system unclogging it," said Embakasi West Mp George Theuri The MP said areas that will benefit first are Umoja 2 estate stretch between Mama Lucy Hospital and Harrys Tavern being the most affected. Area residents have in the past few days been forced to use carts (mkokoteni) for transport, others would walk through the water while the lucky ones would use their vehicles. "Plans are underway to do a pedestrian footpath all along Moi Drive and partly overlay the entire 4km stretch soon the funds are availed to KURA," said Theuri. Vehicles and PSVs also face a challenge of getting stuck in the potholes filled with water.
