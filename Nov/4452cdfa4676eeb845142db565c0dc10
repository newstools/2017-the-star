The national government through the equalization kitty is funding Shs2.1 billion water projects in 7 Arid and Semi Arid counties in Northern Kenya. The projects are spread across Garissa (shs 360 million), Isiolo (shs 144 million) Marsabit (shs 195 million), Wajir (shs 500 million) and Samburu (shs 740 million). Water and irrigation PS Prof. Fred Segor said that the projects are meant minimise distance and time covered in search for water. They include water pans, dams and boreholes and will be completed within the next one and three years.  The Abakaile water pan that is 80 percent complete is expected to serve a population of 6,000 households and 140,000 livestock. “We idea at the end of the day is to minimize water stress in terms of the number of kms people go to fetch water. We intend to ensure that we subscribe to what is expected internationally that people should be able to access water in 30 minutes,” Segor said. MCA Mohamed Ali said it will reduce dropout cases among the pastoralist communities who are sometimes forced to withdraw children from school to travel long distance in search of water and pasture for their animals.
