Former Laikipia Governor Joshua Irungu yesterday suffered a blow after a court rejected his application to be included as an interested party in a petition challenging the election of Ndiritu Muriithi. High Court Judge Mary Kasango struck out the petition and ordered Irungu to pay a Sh100,000 fine to four respondents. The Nanyuki-based judge said Irungu “sat on his rights and delayed his application” and then sought to expand the scope of the petition against the strict timelines provided by law. On Monday, Irungu sought to be included in the case. Last week, Dennis Leman, the second petitioner, withdrew his petition. Sammy Ndung’u from Thingithu in Laikipia East and Leman from Sosian in Laikipia North filed the petitions. In the petitions filed by Kirinyaga-based lawyer Ramadhan Abubakar, the two said voting disenfranchised many Laikipia North voters. Ndung’u is challenging the electoral process that led to Muriithi being declared winner. Leman argued voters in Sosian ward did not vote because of insecurity. The IEBC is the first respondent, while Muriithi and Deputy Governor John Mwaniki are the second and third respondents, respectively. The county returning officer is the fourth respondent. Muriithi ran as an independent and defeated Irungu of Jubilee after garnering 100,356 votes against his 98,349. Soon after the election results were announced, Irungu conceded defeat. He later attended the swearing-in ceremony of the new county boss in Nanyuki Stadium, where he pledged to support him.
