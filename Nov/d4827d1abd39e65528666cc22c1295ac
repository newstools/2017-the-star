President-elect Uhuru Kenyatta faces a 14-day journey to his assumption of office as legal battles challenging his victory loom. The electoral commission’s declaration of Uhuru as the winner of the fresh presidential election boycotted by opposition leader Raila Odinga marked the beginning of another slippery path for the country’s 4th President. Uhuru, who won the October 26 poll overwhelmingly, will have to surmount an avalanche of legal hurdles that could either validate or annul his victory. Uhuru garnered 7.4 million votes, representing more than 98 per cent of the votes cast in an election marked by low turnout. Only about four out of 10 voters cast their votes. The petitions are likely to be anchored on IEBC’s inability to conduct elections in at least 25 rebellious constituencies at the heart of Raila’s Nyanza stronghold. Article 138 of the Constitution provides that a presidential election should be held in each of the 290 constituencies. Parties seeking to challenge Uhuru’s victory have until November 6 - the expiry of the constitutional seven days provided - to file petitions at the Supreme Court. If Uhuru’s win is unchallenged at the apex court, he will be sworn in on November 14. Article 141{2} of the Constitution states, “The President shall be sworn in on the first Tuesday following the 14th day after the date of the declaration of the results of the presidential election, if no petition has been filed.” After filing of the petitions, the seven-judge bench will then have seven days to hear and determine the cases. The apex court, which on September 1 overturned Uhuru’s initial win, could either uphold his latest victory, or order another fresh poll in 60 days. This would be an unprecedented decision that could set the country into uncharted and perilous territory. Having won by a landslide, Uhuru would take oath of office on November 21, if the Supreme Court throws out any legal challenge.
