Gor Mahia head coach Dylan Kerr has dismissed claims going round linking him with the Harambee Stars’ top job. Kerr was heavily linked with succeeding Stanley Okumbi at the helm of the national team but the Briton has come out to rubbish the claims. Kerr explained that his earlier statement about Harambee Stars was misinterpreted, insisting that he had just offered himself for consultations with the current national coach. Kerr, who guided Gor Mahia to a record 16th Premiership title, added that his contract with K’Ogalo bound him to exclusively serve the club. “I do not want the Harambee Stars job. I was asked a straight question if I can be interested in the job and I said ‘no’. I am at Gor Mahia and my contract indicates that I am a Gor Mahia coach and so, I am happy at the club. I am not in any way interested in coaching the national team and I wouldn’t want to even think about that while at the moment,” Kerr was quoted on the club’s official page. The former Simba SC tactician further expressed his commitment in working with Gor for long spells as the support and the conditions of the club were favorable. He praised the quality of the squad and the unwavering support from the Green Army. “I am very comfortable at Gor Mahia. l like the chairman because he offers massive support and gives me room to do my work. I love my players and I do appreciate the vibrant fans. This is where I want to be and hopefully I will renew my contract so that we can achieve more together.” Kerr is expected to oversee the remaining three SportPesa Premier League fixtures and embark on strengthening for next year’s Caf Champions League as well as the upcoming local campaigns.
