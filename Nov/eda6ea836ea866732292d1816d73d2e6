An international lobby has called on the government to stem rising violence related to ethnic hatred. Amnesty International urged the government to take steps to end tension between communities, protect people and ensure their safety as opposition supporters protest against the Supreme Court’s verdict upholding President Uhuru Kenyatta’s re-election. This comes as more deaths continue to be recorded, especially in opposition strongholds.  Police and gangs have been blamed for the deaths. According to Amnesty International, a witness recounted how youths in Kondele and Kisumu searched houses on Monday, looking for Kikuyu residents, harassed them and looted. The witness said three groups tried to enter his compound, adding his neighbour’s gate was torn down and he and his family were forced to flee.  Some protesters tried to burn down Kondele police station. “In the last couple of days and months, the police have fired indiscriminately at crowds, killing or injuring protesters. Kenya’s police have a duty to protect people from violence, but they must do so in a way that respects both national and international law. This election has caused enough bloodshed. No more lives should be lost due to excessive use of force by the police,” Justus Nyang’aya, the country director at Amnesty International Kenya, said. The organisation said at least six people were killed in Nairobi a day before the ruling.
