Investment in technology is the key to growth in the agricultural sector in Kenya and across the continent, industry players have said. Speaking at a two-day forum on impact investment, African Rural and Agricultural Credit Association secretary general Saleh Gashua told industry stakeholders that other African countries needed to adopt ICT in their agricultural practices. “ICT has done a lot for Kenya in credit disbursement to rural areas. We need to see how we can replicate the Kenya experience in other African countries,” he said. Agriculture is deemed high risk because it is the economic backbone in most African states. CBK governorPatrick Njoroge told governments to leverage on private investment to meet agricultural finance needs.
