Kenyans have entered uncharted territory with the second
Supreme Court petition(s) against an IEBC declaration of Jubilee leader Uhuru
Kenyatta as President-elect.  Opposition NASA has refused to acknowledge Uhuru as
President and have launched a secession motion to be debated in at least 19
county assemblies. Both the petitions against the President and the breakaway
attempt are based on the 2010 Constitution.  NASA has sought to completely delegitimize President Uhuru
and Deputy President William Ruto, painting them as incapable of abiding by the
Constitution or allowing a free, fair, accountable and predictable election.
Instead, they accuse the duo of staging elections with predetermined outcomes. All the elements of a cataclysmically violent crisis in
Kenya are now in place. The top two national leaders – President Uhuru and former
Prime Minister Raila Odinga – need to meet and save Kenya from violent
disintegration. The Catholic Church has already offered to intercede and get
Kenya’s leaders talking on how to reform the system and make it more inclusive. Other peacemakers and mediators need to step forward.
