Veteran Mombasa politician and former Changamwe MP Ramadhan Kajembe's son is dead. Seif Kajembe died on Tuesday at 3am at a hospital in India where he has been receiving treatment for kidney problems. His brother Sudi Kajembe said he has been at the hospital for the last two weeks. The 45-year-old first born was being groomed to take over the political mantle from his father who has been in active politics for over 30 years. The family said they are devastated by the news. Seif vied for the Jomvu MP seat in 2013 but lost to his brother-in-law Badi Twalib.
