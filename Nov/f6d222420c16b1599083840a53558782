Bishop Cornelius Korir’s tomb inside the Sacred Heart Cathedral in Eldoret has been sealed using a concrete slab, marble and water-proof cement. The burial sparked public debate after the casket containing Korir’s body was placed inside the tomb, which was locked. They had wanted to view it. “The tomb is being completed in the best way,” Father William Kosgey from the Eldoret Diocese said. A check by the Star yesterday indicated engineers are putting the finishing touches on the tomb. The tomb in a small room behind the altar is still locked to the public until it’s fully completed. According to Catholic doctrine, a bishop who dies while still in office can be buried inside the church or at a special resting place. The Catholic Church has said it will in the next few days appoint an acting bishop for the diocese of Eldoret. The Pope’s representative to Kenya, Archbishop Charles Daniel Balvo, said it may take time to get Bishop Korir’s substantive replacement. “His death represents a big task to identify a new bishop, but we will soon appoint someone to act as we get a person to take over from Korir,” he said.
