World 1500m champion Elijah Manangoi, 2012 Olympic 3,000m steeplechase bronze medalist Abel Mutai and world 1,500m silver Timothy Cheruiyot are expected to light up the first Athletics Kenya Cross Country meeting to be held at the Posta Grounds, Ngong Road on Saturday. The trio alongside regular grass runner, John Chepkwony, will grace men’s 10km race. The 2010 World Half Marathon bronze medallist Peninah Arusei and 2017 London World Championships 1,500m semi-finalist Winny Chebet are among the elite runners expected to grace Athletics Kenya (AK) cross country series opener at Posta grounds on Ngong Road in Nairobi. The two will compete in the women’s 10km category alongside Ndalaat Gaa cross country winner Sandra Felis Chebet. Athletics Kenya (AK) Nairobi County chairman Barnaba Korir said they expect a stellar line up as athletes seek to gauge their form after a lengthy off-season. “As host county, we are putting measures to ensure the meeting is a success. We are inviting athletes to come and start their season here as we look forward to a long season with numerous local and international assignments,” said Korir. “We expect to extend the success story that was Ndalaat Gaa as runners seek to maintain form and shape ahead of next year Africa Cross Country Championships in Algeria in March and the Commonwealth Games a month later in Gold Coast, Australia.” The event, will feature five events including 10km (senior men and women), boys 8km, girls 6km and mixed relays. The top six finishers in each of the four races will be rewarded with prize money with winners in the senior ranks walking away with Sh10,000 each. Junior race winners will win Sh8,000 while top relay team will pocket Sh20,000. After Nairobi the meeting, the series will head to Sotik, Nyandarua and Iten before paving way for the affiliate editions and culminating in the national cross country championships on February 10 at Uhuru Gardens, where the national team to the continental show will be picked.
