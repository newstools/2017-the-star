Farmers have thanked the national government for three milk coolers donated to Ol Kalou Dairies Ltd, 2016, on November 7. Ol Kalou Dairies chairman Isaac Muchiri yesterday said the Sh18 million equipment has enabled the factory  to increase milk collected from farmers to 70,000 litres a day from 40,000 litres. Muchiri spoke at Ol Kalou Dairies Ltd during the annual farmers’ field day. He said the three coolers have a capacity of 96,000 litres of milk a day.Two coolers were installed at the main facility in Ol Kalou town. The third was installed at Passenga branch. The equipment operates automatically and has an inbuilt generator, water heating system and cleans automatically. Muchiri said, “Chances of milk getting contaminated at the facility are slim. “This has ensured the milk, once received from farmers, is kept in the best condition before being handed over to the processors.” Muchiri urged farmers to take advantage of the rains and store enough fodder to cater for the dry period.
