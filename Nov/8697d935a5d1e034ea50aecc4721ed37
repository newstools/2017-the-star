Former Kasipul MP Oyugis Magwanga has lined up 22 witnesses to testify in an election petition challenging the reelection of Homa Bay Governor Cyprian Awiti. Magwanga wants the High Court in Homa Bay to nullify the reelection of Awiti. He cited irregularities, including bribery and threats to his agents. Magwanga and his running mate Joshua Orero filed a petition against Awiti, his deputy Hamilton Orata, county returning officer Michaels Kosgei and the IEBC. There was confusion at the beginning of the hearing after Magwangaâ€™s Forms 37A, which he said were presented to him by his agents and issued by the IEBC, differed from the ones the electoral agency presented to the court.  During a cross-examination by IEBC advocate Fredrick Orego, two parties presented two different copies of the forms bearing different serial numbers. Some forms were blank.
