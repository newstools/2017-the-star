Kwale fish farmers will benefit from projects worth Sh16 by the government to improve aquaculture, Agriculture and Fisheries CS Willy Bett has said. Speaking at Shimoni during the International Fisheries Day on Tuesday, Bett said the projects are aimed at capacity building and awareness creation for caged fishing. The funding is through a partnership with International Fund for Agricultural Development. "If people are informed it will help increase the rate at which fish is consumed in the county," Bett said. The CS discouraged fish importation from China and urge local fishermen to adopt aquaculture. "When local fishermen form groups and practice aquaculture, it will produce enough for our consumption," Bett said. Bett also said that they will create internal markets for fish products. He urged the people to also try fish ponds and not rely much on sea fishing. "The funds that are coming will train you on the best technology to do fish ponds so let's start ones at our homes," he said. Principal secretary of Fisheries Prof. Micheni Ntiba asked the county government to domesticate the Fisheries Management and Conservation Act 2016 for the interest of the people. County executive for Agriculture Joan Nyamasyo said that fishermen face a challenge to practice sea fishing as they lack weapons to access deep sea. "If our fishermen are provided with best technology to access deep sea they it will increase their catch," she said. Namasyo added that,the county government has come up with motorized boats which can accommodate up to 30 fishermen and take up to four tonnes of fish. "We will share this boats to the beach management units(BMU) so that our fishermen can get adequate fish," she said.
