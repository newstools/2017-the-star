A CCM MP in Bomet, who has been a bitter critic of Jubilee now supports the party. Chepalungu MP Gideon Koskei, an ally of former Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto, and a vocal critic of JP and Deputy President William Ruto during the last election, has endorsed the DP’s 2022 bid. Speaking in Sotik at the weekend, Koskei said, “I was elected on a CCM ticket, but I want to make it known today that I am now a loyal supporter of Jubilee. Moving forward, I fully support the President and the DP because they are committed to their work.” He also defended Governor Joyce Laboso and criticised those opposing the changes she has made. The governor should be given time to deliver on her pre-election promises to the electorate, he said.
