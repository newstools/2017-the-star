The long running battle
for the control of the estate of ex-Nairobi PC
Godhard John Mburu has returned to court, with a bid for the exhumation the body of his first
wife. The wife, Carmelina
Ngami died on October 24 and was buried a week later at her matrimonial home in
Murang’a. But businesswoman Catherine
Njeri says there was mischief in her "hurried" burial. She filed an application at the Milimani law court.  Njeri, who claims to be the lawyer for Carmelina, told the court that her client's hurried burial was suspect. She claims the
burial was secretly done. She wants the court to order that the body be exhumed and a
postmortem conducted to establish the cause of Carmelina's death. Mburu's death and burial, more than 30 years ago, was also marred with controversies. Carmelina disagreed with her co-wives Mary Nduta and Hellen Omoka on where he would be buried. Carmelina was childless. Njeri claimed that she always talked about the agony of not having children. She has also been
following up on the distribution of the estate of her late husband for the last
35 years.  The woman at one time
claimed that the multibillion property in Karen, which is claimed by several
people, belonged to her late husband.   Njeri,
has sued Louisa Wanjiru Mburu, Patrick Nyoike Mwaura and Sylvia Nduta Hinga as
respondents in the case.  She is accusing the three of hurriedly and
secretly removing the Carmelina's body from Kenyatta University Mortuary, despite a court
order blocking the burial. Njeri says Carmelina
may not have died of natural causes, given the animosity within the family.
