Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati has named his
ten-member Cabinet after days of speculation and social media bashing. However, the unveiled list of CEC nominees has been sharply criticised after he left out youths and people living with disabilities. Western human rights group executive director Job Bwonya said the they will go to court to stop the county assembly from vetting the proposed names. "You can clearly see that the governor failed to meet the basic
principles of the Constitution. There is no doubt that we
will head to court." Wangamati nominated Richard
Sabwami - principal of Sikusi secondary school - as Public Service
and Administration CEC. Brawel Murgor, a banker
by profession, was nominated to the Land, Urban and Physical Planning docket. Everlyn Kakai has been proposed to be Youth and Gender CEC while Renson Makheti will man the Environment and Water docket. Collins Mukhongo, a KRA
official, has been proposed to be in charge of the Roads and Infrastructure post. Esther Wamalwa will steer the Finance and Economic Planning  docket if MCAs approve her nomination.  She is currently the head of finance
at print exchange limited - a foreign firm. Mathews Makanda is the proposed Agriculture and Livestock CEC. He unsuccessfully contested the Kimilili parliamentary seat during the August election. Betty Mayeku, a Kibabii University lecturer,  has been named CEC for Education and Vocational training. Antony Walela, a pharmacist by profession, was nominated to the Health
docket.   Wangamati said he had factored in regional
balancing and ensured that the nominees met the requirements of Chapter Six of the Constitution. "We have ensured that each sub county has one nominee in a bid
to have an all inclusive government." Wangamati said he had picked the ten out of 300 applicants.
