Divers have found the wreckage of the aircraft that crashed into Lake Nakuru leaving five people dead. It was found on Friday after a three-week search. Jonathan Kertich, a desk officer at the National Disaster Operations Centre, said the remnant was on the southern side of the lake and that retrieval exercises began shortly after. "It is a step ahead. We hope we will find bodies," Kertich said, adding teams would ensure smooth operations. Journalists and victims' relatives were barred from Lake Nakuru National Park after the discovery. Nakuru Senator Susan Kihika's bloggers Sam Gitau, John Mapozi and Antony Kipyegon were among those who died in the crash. The others were pilot Apollo Malowa and his friend Veronica Muthoni. The crash occurred on October 21 moments after the chopper left Jarika Hotel for Jubilee Party campaigns in Nakuru.  Malowa and Kipyegon's bodies were found on October 23 and later buried.
