Nyandarua executives have been urged to ensure they deliver on Governor Francis Kimemia’s development agenda as is outlined in his manifesto. Deputy Governor Cecilia Mbuthia said at the end of five years their administration will be judged on how well it managed county finances. She spoke on Tuesday afternoon during the swearing in of the executives at the county headquarters. In taking the oath of office, signing the acceptance forms and performance contracts, Mbuthia said the executive members and the county secretary swore to be the agents of change that the people of Nyandarua want. She added that the residents elected her and Kimemia based on the manifesto they presented. “You have been chosen because we believe you have what it takes to bring that change. So far we have not wavered in our resolve to deliver the pledge we made for a transformative agenda to improve this county,” she said. Mbuthia told the executives to perform their duties with integrity. She said it is their duty to always seek the best to improve residents’ lives.
