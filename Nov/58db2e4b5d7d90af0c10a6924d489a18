Former Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero has lost his bid to be joined in the petition challenging Mike Sonko's August 8 win. Judge Msagha Mbogholi said Kidero's application was misconceived and lacks merit and dismissed dismissing it with costs. Kidero put up a spirited fight at the High Court in a bid to be part of the petition challenging Sonko's win. Two voters, Japheth Muroko and Zachaeus Okoth, moved to court to challenge the results. Sonko had opposed the application, and on Thursday posted a prayer on Facebook seeking divine intervention ahead of the decision. The governor accused Kidero of trying to challenge his win 'through the backdoor'. Sonko told Justice Mbogholi that Kidero’s attempt to join the petition as an interested party is prejudicial to him.  IEBC also opposed Kidero’s application. Kidero said he had new evidence to help the court reach a fair judgement. IEBC faulted the former governor for failing to explain why he did not file a petition against Sonko within the 28 days set by the Constitution.
