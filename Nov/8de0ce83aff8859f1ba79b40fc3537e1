Devolution CS Mwangi Kiunjuri has asked NASA to move on, saying “It is finished. It is time to go. It is [a new] dawn.” On Monday the Supreme Court dismissed two petitions challenging President Uhuru Kenyatta’s October 26 win. Kiunjuri said there will be anarchy if the opposition defies “the will of the people who elected Uhuru”. NASA has said it does not recognise Uhuru’s win. He spoke in Mombasa on Wednesday, when he opened the ministry’s sixth National Monitoring and Evaluation Week. The theme was ‘Moving Forward Agenda Vision 2030: Monitoring and Evaluation for SDGs in Achieving the Country’s Development Results.’ Uhuru will be sworn in on Tuesday. NASA has said it will announce the way forward today. The coalition has said it will swear in opposition leader Raila Odinga as President of the People’s Republic of Kenya. Kiunjuri warned against this, saying it amounts to treason.  NASA has said it will go ahead with plans to form a People’s Assembly, which have been halted by a court in Kitui.
