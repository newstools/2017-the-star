Demand for global air freight saw the slowest pace of growth in five months in September, and it appears that the recent run of growth in air freight has peaked, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) said. Freight demand, measured in freight tonne kilometres (FTK), rose 9.2 percent year-on-year in September, down from 11.6 percent in August. IATA said demand growth has been 10.1 percent so far this year, meaning that its forecast of 7.5 percent growth for 2017 seems to have “significant upside potential”. “Demand for air cargo grew by 9.2 per cent in September. While that’s slower than in previous months, it remains stronger than anything we have seen in recent memory. But there are signs that this demand spurt may have peaked. So it becomes even more important to reinforce the industry’s competitiveness by accelerating the modernization of its many antiquated processes,” said Alexandre de Juniac, IATA’s Director General and CEO. “But there are signs that this demand spurt may have peaked,” he said. All regions saw a deceleration in year-on-year FTK growth compared to August. Available capacity rose 3.9 percent in the month, compared to September last year, boosting load factors. It appears that the industry has passed a cyclical growth peak. The upward trend in seasonally-adjusted freight volumes in quarter three has eased and the inventory-to-sales ratio in the US is now trending sideways. This indicates that the period when companies look to restock inventories quickly—which often gives air cargo a boost—has ended, the association said.
