Kisii Senator Sam Ongeri has dismissed the October 26 repeat election, which President-elect Uhuru Kenyatta won by a landslide, as a Jubilee Party referendum. He said Uhuru lacks the legitimacy to rule as only 39 per cent of registered voters elected him. “They have concluded their referendum. Now President Kenyatta should sit down and talk with NASA leader Raila Odinga,” Ongeri said. He spoke to journalists outside the High Court in Kisii after attending the hearing of an election petition against Kisii woman representative Janet Ong’era. “The country needs peace and cohesion. Dialogue is the only way to get us out of this quagmire,” Ongeri said. He was part of the former UN secretary general Kofi Annan’s team that brokered a peace deal between President Kibaki and Raila after the disputed December 27, 2007, General Election.
