  Two candidates in the Kitutu Chache South by-election yesterday accused their opponents of hiring goons to intimidate their supporters. Jubilee’s Anthony Kibagendi and Wiper’s Andrew Maubi claimed the hooligans were paid to chase away voters from polling stations. Speaking to the press separately, the two attributed the low voter turnout to harassment. Kibagendi said the county government had some employees on hand to bribe voters in favour of an opponent he did not name. “I am disgusted that some of my opponents hired goons to harass and intimidate my agents and voters,” he said. “I have reported the matter to the police for action. The low voter turnout is a result of the events.” Kibagendi also attributed the low turnout to voter fatigue. Maubi urged the police to investigate and take action against the culprits. Meanwhile, the number of polling centres where the KIEMS kits failed has increased to four.  They are Raganga, Nyamondo, Daraja Mbili and Nyabisai. Speaking to the press after casting his vote at St Peter’s Soko Primary School, former MP Richard Onyonka (pictured) said he had raised the issue with the IEBC, which assured him the issue would be addressed. The KIEMS kits were fixed. Onyonka said the turnout was low because the election had been postponed twice, killing voters’ morale.  The Ford Kenya candidate said the weather was also unfavourable.
