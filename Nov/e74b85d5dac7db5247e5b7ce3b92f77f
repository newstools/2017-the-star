A lawyer who successfully represented veteran politician Kenneth Matiba in a compensation suit against the state is seeking Sh234million as legal costs. John Mburu has filed a bill of cost of Sh234,614,128.52, being the expenses he spent since August 31, 2013, when he instructed and notified the state of Matiba’s intention to institute legal proceedings. In August, Supreme Court Judge Isaac Lenaola awarded Matiba, 85, more than Sh1 billion as compensation for detention and the inhumane treatment he underwent at the hands of security agents. Lenaola handled the case when he was still a High Court judge. He said no compensation could return Matiba to the healthy state he was in before his detention, but added justice is expensive. Matiba suffered a serious stroke on May 26, 1991, but remained in detention without medication for a week. He was arrested during the clamour for multiparty democracy at the height of the Daniel Moi regime’s purge on dissent.  Lenaola said Matiba proved great violations were meted out to him by state agents before he was released on June 4, 1991. The lawyer’s case will be heard on Wednesday next week.
