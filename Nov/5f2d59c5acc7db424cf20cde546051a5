Multiple former Kenya champion Baldev Chager took over the Safari Classic Rally lead to dislodge compatriot Carl Tundo as the event reached half-way stage yesterday. Chager is currently leading the table in his Kabras- supported Porsche after four days of the competition. His Kabras team-mate and former national and Safari Rally Champion, Tundo is lying third in his Triumph TR7. Like Chager, he is also seeking his first time victory in the 2017 Classic Rally. Chager was happy with his position.  “The car has been good. There are no mechanical problems and we had a clean run through all the  stages. Definitely settling in well and enjoying it very much and doing it how it’s supposed to be done. We have managed to take advantage of others’ mishaps but it’s very close,” said Chager.. The battle for the overall lead of the 2017 Classic Safari Rally remains tight as drivers take a rest day today at Neptune in Diani at the end of Day 4 in the 10-day competition.   Defending champion, Stiq Blomqvist has now dropped to eighth position after leading the rally on Day One. His Porsche is said to be suffering from mechanical issues. Similar mechanical issues have seen Ian Duncan drop to the last place after his Ford Capri stopped again in the stage.  Ramesh Vishram is motoring well in his Cementer Racing Ford Escort Mark2, lying a comfortable 15th overall on his fourth Classic Rally. Another local driver limping on with the competition is Nish Lakhani in a Datsun 1600sss despite minor problems with the car. He is lying 21st. “Unfortunately due to our earlier problems at the start of the rally, we are still limping. However,  we are running our own race and whenever we get to the end of the day we are a jolly bunch. During the rest day, the parc ferme is open for crews to withdraw their cars from the rest halt parking lot for the purposes of servicing only from 07h00.  As per the regulations, cars are allowed to be taken out for service between 0700 and 0800hrs for a maximum of six hours of mechanical work out. Drivers must return their cars to the main park by latest by 1400hrs. Non-compliance with this regulation will be reported to the clerk of the course and the penalty may go as far as exclusion. For drivers, today’s rest day is vital as mechanics get the chance to do a complete check up on the respective rally cars. This is the second year Shell is partnering with the classic rally fraternity to supply fuel for the participants. “Every vehicle shall use Shell V-Power and we are extremely excited about this. We wish every driver the very best. Shell V-Power is the only high octane fuel that is retailed in Kenya,” said Mark Senteu, the marketing and customer care manager, Vivo Energy Kenya.
