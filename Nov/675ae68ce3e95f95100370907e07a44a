Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya can now breath easy after the High Court in Mombasa dismissed a petition challenging his August 8 victory. Judge Mugure Thande threw out the petition filed by voter Mbwana Mwamlole, terming it incompetent and incurably defective. This is a blow to former Ambassador to Tanzania Chirau Mwakwere, who lost to Mvurya. Mwakwere ran on the Wiper ticket. Mwamlole wanted the election nullified and a fresh one ordered. Justice Thande said the petitioner failed to comply with two sections of the election petition rules. She said the petitioner erred when he failed to enjoin Deputy Governor Fatuma Achani in the petition, yet she was an important party. Thande said the outcome of the petition would affect Achani and therefore she deserved an opportunity to defend herself. She said the petition could have met the threshold if the petitioner had corrected the defects within 28 days after declaration of the results. “The court cannot entertain an incurably defective petition,” Thande said. The petition was also struck out on grounds that Mwamlole did not indicate the date of declaration of results. Thande said this was critical in determining whether the petition was filed on time or not and the court could not shut its eyes on the issue. “The petition rules committee spent much time and effort to come up with the election petition rules and therefore it is a must they be adhered to,” she added. The petitioner is expected to pay Sh2.5 million as the petition cost.
