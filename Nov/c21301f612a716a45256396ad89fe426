Gem MP Elisha Odhiambo has dismissed the Supreme Court ruling as a “political decision based on a political impasse” rather than a legal verdict. Odhiambo said the Supreme Court verdict contradicts the earlier ruling of the same court in 2013 where the four judges Smokin Wanjala, Njoki Ndungu, Jackton Ojwang and Mohamed Ibrahim were party to.  He said the four judges upheld the opinion that in the event a presidential candidate withdraws, a fresh nomination was a must. Speaking to the Star on the phone yesterday, Odhiambo wondered why the Supreme Court is “inconsistent”. Odhiambo said even though the ruling was expected, especially after NASA failed to file a petition, the court should have been consistent.   He said NASA is waiting for direction from leader Raila Odinga. “After Raila’s direction, I am sure we will be prosecuting the matter in the public court to get the people’s verdict too,” Odhiambo said. He said the verdict upholding President Uhuru Kenyatta’s victory when more than 20 constituencies didn’t participate in the October 26 elections is in itself “illegal”. Alego Usonga MP Samuel Atandi, who also spoke to the Star separately, said NASA is not going to make rash decisions about its next course of action. He urged supporters to be patient.
