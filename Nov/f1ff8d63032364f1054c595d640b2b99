Voting at Daraja Mbili Primary School in Kitutu Chache South constituency was delayed for hours on Tuesday after KIEMS kits failed to work. Many who turned up to vote left in protest saying they had to attend to their businesses. Incumbent MP Richard Onyonka is facing off with Jubilee's Anthony Kibagendi and ODM's Samuel Omwando. Despite being open from 6am, there was low turnout in a number of polling stations. By 9am, only 20 people had voted at the Daraja Mbili Primary School where there are 400 registered voters. The constituency has about 59,000 registered voters. Â
