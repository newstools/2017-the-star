Mwingi Central MCA Mary Kanini (pictured) has urged residents to harvest rainwater for future use.  Mwingi has perennial water shortages. Kanini said it is high time residents take water harvesting seriously.  Speaking to journalists in Mwingi on Friday, Kanini said taps have been dry for more than a month. Residents urged the Kiambere Mwingi Water and Sanitation Company, which supplies water in Mwingi, to address the situation.  “Residents should collect water from their roofs and other potential water harvesting points,” Kanini said.  She thanked the government for installing street lights, adding that incidents of crim have declined. Kanini said businesses will now be able to extend their opening hours.
