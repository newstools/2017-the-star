An Embu MP says the demand by some men to marry only circumcised women is perpetuating female genital mutilation. Embu woman representative Jane Wanjuki told the Star on Friday some parents influence their sons, telling them to marry only circumcised women. Such mutilated women are said to be faithful wives, not seeking other men. As a result of the pressure, some parents are secretly and forcibly ensuring their girls undergo the “cut” so that they can get husbands.  This has contributed greatly to the criminal, dangerous and sometimes deadly practice that must be eradicated, Wanjuki said. The woman rep said recently four minors were circumcised by force and three others were rescued in Gichiche, Mbeere South Constituency.  This is another clear indication FGM is going on in secret. She is campaigning against FGM and said it will be one of her priorities during her term. The MP said she will organise meetings for parents, boys and girls to educate them about the dangerous of the practice. Wanjuki said the world has rejected FGM, as it flies in the face of progress. She said girls who undergo the rite might never get husbands in the future.  Wanjuki said she has organised a seminar for boys and girls at Nyangwa Secondary School from November 21 -24. It aims to educate the youth against demanding circumcised girls for wives. She urged security officials to arrest and prosecute parents who abet the practice.  On November 2, seven girls were hospitalised after four were forced to undergo FGM. Three were waiting for their turn when the circumciser and two parents were arrested. The girls aged between nine and 11 years were rescued by national government officers from a den at Gichiche village where they were recuperating after being mutilated.
