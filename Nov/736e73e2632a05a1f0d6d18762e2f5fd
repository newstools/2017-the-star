Two competitors, Jay Lennox, and Tom Evans, both from Canada, have already picked their tools of trade and are sharpening their skills ahead of the World Ploughing Competition in Nakuru. Tractor seller FMD has provided Massey Ferguson tractors to be used in the two day World Ploughing Championship next week at Ngongongeri Farm in Egerton University by contestants from over 20 countries. The official practise session starts Monday until Thursday, while the main competition will be December 1 and 2 at the farm, where a panel of six  judges will grade them on standards based on for consistent depth, width and spacing of the land by each participant. Winners will receive bronze, silver and gold medals. “This championship is merely for notable achievements as the winners will get medals only,” Canada coach Daryl Hostrawser, a seasoned competitor said. Kenya is hosting the championship for the second time after 22 years. The 21 year-old Kenya Ploughing Organisation (KPO) which is under the Agricultural Society of Kenya organizes national ploughing contests to help raise the standards of seed bed preparation. The organisation also holds countrywide competitions to select participants in the national championship to qualify for the international contests.
