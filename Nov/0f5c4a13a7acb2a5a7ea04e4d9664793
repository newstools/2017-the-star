The Assumption of Office Committee has denied spending Sh19 million during the swearing-in of Garissa Governor Ali Korane in September. The team says the total spent was Sh4.7 million. Committee chairman Mohamud Mursal on Thursday said the committee is open to scrutiny. He said investigating agencies can access information on spending for the event. A report from the Assumption of Office Committee that was handed over to Korane last week showed the team spent Sh19 million, including committee members allowances. “Whatever you saw in the report was the best budget estimates the committee could have, but the actual spending was Sh4.7 million,” he said. The committee members say they received Sh6 million from the Controller of Budget and only spent Sh4.7 million for the ceremony. They have not, however, explained what happened to the balance. The report shows the committee spent a huge amount of money on the renovation of the dais, refreshments and hiring of media services. In a detailed report from the Assumption of Office, which the Star has seen, the team spent Sh19 million inclusive of their allowances, conference facilities, drivers and fuelling of their vehicles. The report also indicates the expenses of hiring of media services, band services, provision of first aid, event ushers, security and lodge. The Assumption of the Office of the Governor Committee was established on July 7 this year by the Devolution ministry.
