The 17th edition of the annual Lamu Cultural Festival has got off to a high note in Lamu Old Town. The four-day fete runs from November 16 to 19. The festival is an annual event that showcases the rich culture and heritage of Lamu’s Swahili people that has captivated the world for centuries. The festival presents visitors an opportunity to see traditional dances, the famous donkey race, dhow races, swimming competition, heena painting and skills such as wood-carving. This year’s cultural theme is ‘Peace and Cohesion’, which was coined following the intense political situation. Traders and business said they expect to sell more wares in the four days than they would in a month. Many are of the opinion that this year’s fete will be a indicator on whether tourists have regained enough confidence to visit Lamu. Lamu’s tourism was badly hit in 2014 and 2015 following a number of al Shabaab attacks. Some foreign countries issued travel advisories and Lamu was placed under curfew. “We are looking forward to some good profit margins. All my rooms are fully booked and in fact I had to turn away other guests," Sun Sail Hotel proprietor Ali Bunu said.
