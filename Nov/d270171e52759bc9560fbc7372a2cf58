Sports CS Hassan Wario has called on film makers to utilise the power of film and change the negative narrative being told about Kenya. Speaking during the opening of the International Film Convention at Safari Park Hotel yesterday, Wario said the African story as told by others often misrepresents the realities of Kenyan culture. His sentiments were echoed by Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua who said there is a tendency by film makers to produce films from the slums like Kibera and Mathare, forgetting the country has other captivating sceneries. “Kenyans should focus on other geographical sceneries like the Mara and the magical valleys and hills that define our landscape,” he said Mutua further said film makers should see the industry as a money-making venture to avoid seeking funding from donors who will in turn force them to change their scripts. The theme of yesterday’s convention was, “Taking the Audio-Visual Industry in Kenya and Eastern Africa to the Next Level”. Wario said film festivals should be encouraged in other areas of the country and also have Africa as a whole create an iconic event like the Oscars to celebrate film makers and actors. He recognised the important role Arts and Culture can play in creating employment opportunities and furthering economic development in the region.
