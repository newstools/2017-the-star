A KCSE candidate in Molo was stabbed at the weekend following an argument over food. Isaac Kariuki, a 17-year-old student of Chandera Secondary School, had attended a circumcision celebration for his friends when the fight broke out. Kariuki was stabbed under unclear circumstances on Saturday night and died on Monday morning while being treated at Molo sub-county hospital. Kevin Kimani said a group of 11 boys went to visit two friends who had undergone the rite of passage. Trouble started when they complained after they served tea and denied food, he said, adding the caretaker grabbed a knife and stood on the bed asking them to leave. "When the owner of the house heard the commotion, he came out with a whip. He pushed the door from outside causing panic as we wanted to run out," he said. "When we got to the village center, one of us said my cousin had been stabbed and was bleeding. I went back for him and found him about 45 metres from the house." Kimani said they took Kariuki to a health center and later to the hospital. But Kahuni Wakimotho said the account given by the boys was false and that the stabbing did not take place in his brother's compound. "If the boy had been stabbed in that house, there would have been blood stains all over." Wakimotho claimed a disagreement arose when the caretaker, who is in police custody, refused to let the boys give the initiates bhang and rebuked them. He said they got angry and resorted to causing chaos. Kariuki's mother Susan Mukami said her son was a well-mannered boy who did not smoke bhang as suggested. "I never had a problem with him concerning his behavior. He did not indulge in any drugs," she said, noting the family had ensured his readiness for the national examinations. She added they expected he would perform well  Molo deputy county commissioner David Wanyonyi said they were investigating the cause of death. He asked parents to embrace modern alternatives where circumcision is concerned.
