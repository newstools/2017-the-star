The Ministry of Education may release the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education examination results this week. Examiners finished marking the tests last week and the ministry is expected to compile the results and release to schools. Earlier, communication from the KNEC indicated the examination results would be released before the end of the month. Speaking to the Star Monday, one of the markers, who sought anonymity, said they had finished marking Kiswahili and English essays by Saturday. However, the markers raised concern over the minimal time allocated for marking the two papers.  They said they were marked hastily and that could result in mistakes. "Last week was the busiest. We were completing the essays and they were a bit challenging because they were the only papers that were marked manually. By Friday, the marking was complete in all centres," a marker said. However, KNEC CEO Mercy Karogo said the council allocated ample time and had contracted enough markers to work within the set timelines. Karogo declined to reveal the exact date when the results will be released. "The ministry will officially communicate the date. As promised, it will be before the end of this week," Karogo told the Star on the phone.  Other examination papers were marked by the newly acquired scanning machines. KNEC bought 20 machines for Sh100 million. Chairman George Magoha said the automated Optical Mark Recognition machines would reduce the work force by up to 50 per cent. This year, the council contracted 20,000 teachers to mark the examinations of 1,003,556 candidates who sat for this year’s KCPE across 28,566 examination centres.  Last year, the KCPE results were released on December 1.  Read: KNEC gets 20 machines worth Sh100m to mark KCPE exams Also read: With KCPE exam over, focus shifts to marking
