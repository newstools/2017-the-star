Poor Kenyans in areas perceived to be supporting NASA will be negatively affected by the coalition’s call for boycott of products. On Friday, NASA, through its National Resistance Movement, called for boycott of Safaricom, Brookside Dairy and Bidco products, claiming activities of the three companies largely contributed to bungling elections. Marakwet Governor Alex Tolgos yesterday warned of traders capitalising on the boycott to exploit the poor. He said traders will sell products offered by the three companies at high prices in perceived NASA strongholds. Tolgos said the move will bring the country’s economy to its knees. He warned that residents from areas where the boycott will take effect will bear the burden. Speaking in Iten, Tolgos said the move will cause a serious drop in NASA’s popularity in Jubilee Party’s perceived strongholds.
