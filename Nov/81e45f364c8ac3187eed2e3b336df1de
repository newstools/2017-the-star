The swearing-in of the eight Kitui county executives was characterised by glaring omissions. During the event held  at  the Kitui Kefri Centre, there  was  confusion when it  was  discovered just moments to the kick off of the swearing-in, there was no Bible. Catholic priest Fr Richard Kyenza rushed to Governor Charity Ngilu’s official car and returned with her copy.  County secretary Alex Kimanzi apologised for the omission, saying “to err is human”. However, even with the Bible delivered, the swearing-in was delayed for nearly two hours after it emerged the oath of office documents were missing. Kitui resident magistrate Rose Ombata, who was officiating the ceremony, said the event could not continue. After consultating Ngilu, Ombata went to her office and spent more than an hour getting the documents ready.  When she returned, the swearing-in proceeded without hitches. During the swearing-in,  there was a light moment  when Tourism executive Patrick Musau added his nickname Kivasila when taking his oath. He had to repeat his oath without the nickname.
