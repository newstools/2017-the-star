Chemelil Sugar Factory in Muhoroni, Kisumu county, requires Sh500 million for comprehensive maintenance to improve production. Acting managing director Gabriel Nyangweso said they need urgent bailout from the government to expedite the maintenance. He addressed the press in his office on Thursday. Nyangweso said the factory operates below capacity and the volumes it produces are not enough to run daily operations and offset the arrears owed to farmers. He said last year, due to insufficient funding, they spent Sh248 million on partial maintenance. This has affected the mill’s efficiency and volume of sugarcane processed. Nyangweso said close to Sh500 million was used to carry out comprehensive maintenance in 2013. The government on Thursday released Sh300 million to the factory to pay farmers. Factory closed Agriculture CS Willy Bett said the money was pledged by President Uhuru Kenyatta in Tinderet constituency. He said the government is focused on improving infrastructure at the factory. Nyangweso said the farmers’ pay arrears were accrued between 2014 to June this year. “We thanked President Kenyatta for honouring the pledge he made to cane farmers,” he said.  The company closed between March and September due to shortage of raw materials. “We started to crush cane in September, but at a lower capacity,” Nyangweso said. Nyangweso said currently they crush 2,500 tonnes of cane instead of the mill’s capacity of 3,000 tonnes. He blamed this on sugarcane shortage, poaching and lack of proper factory maintenance.  Nyangweso said employees have not been paid since April and the factory owes them Sh315 million.  He urged each miller to prioritise sugarcane development to address the problem of shortage.
