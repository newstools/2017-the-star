The hearing of a petition challenging the victory of Nyaribari Chache MP Richard Tong’i has been adjourned. Lawyers for the three petitioners challenging Tong’i told justice Anthony Ndung’u the IEBC and returning officers failed to supply them with the KIEMs kits and SIM cards used in the August 8 General Election. Petitioners Chris Bichage, Zaheer Jhanda and James Kenani said the kits and cards will help them prove their case. Their lawyers Oguttu Mboya and Jennifer Mukobe argued that the IEBC and the returning officer ignored last week’s court ruling requiring them to supply the same within three days. In their submissions, the petitioners argued that non-compliance of the order will affect their case. “Your honor, we are not ready to proceed today because the IEBC and the returning officer have failed to supply us with the documents as you directed,” Oguttu said.  On November 6, Ndung’u ordered the petitioners be supplied with the documents within three days.  The respondents were told to supply the documentse before the hearing scheduled for November 30, December 1, 18, 19 and 20.
