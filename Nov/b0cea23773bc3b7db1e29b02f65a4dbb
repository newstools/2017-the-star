National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi on Tuesday asked MPs from some 112 constituencies to quickly nominate persons to be appointed to their CDF committees. Muturi said the National Government Constituencies Development Fund Board has received nominees from only 178 constituencies. “I am aware that the board has since notified all members to commence the nomination in accordance with the Act and regulations. I therefore encourage all members to expedite the process as requested,” Muturi said.  The NG-CDF committee is composed of the county commissioner, two men and two women, a person with disability, two persons nominated by the constituency office, an officer of the board seconded to the constituency committee and one member co-opted by the board. The CDF board becomes vacant upon the commencement of a new parliament.  They hold office for a period of two years. Majority Leader Aden Duale told the House that he had asked Treasury CS Henry Rotich to release the CDF funds this week.
