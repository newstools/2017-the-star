The Garissa government has suspended all land transactions until a board is constituted. Deputy Governor Abdi Dagane on Friday said the national government has partnered with the county administration to streamline the allocation of land. “The board will ensure we stop this mess in the lands docket,” he said. Dagane urged residents to stop ringfencing land until instructions are given.  “We have plans to give free land to those in need,” he said. The county intends to demarcate 100,000 plots. Dagane said, “We don’t have a shortage of land in the county.” He said the Lands board will resolve all property issues. County commissioner James Kianda urged residents not to take the law into their own hands when dealing with land matters. He said the government will arrest anyone found dividing land for distribution. There have been many land wrangles in the past that have led to the loss of lives and destruction of property. “We don’t see why people should form groups and cartels to issue land while there is an authority mandated by law to demarcate land through the county,” Kianda said. Garissa county has more than 238,000 Somali refugees in refugee camps at Dadaab. The county has a population of 923,060, and a land area of about 45,720.2 square km. Dadaab is the site of a UNHCR base hosting refugees in four camps (Dagahaley, Hagadera, Ifo and Ifo 2 ), making it the second-largest such complex in the world. The centre is run by the UNHCR, and its operations are financed by foreign donors. The governments of Kenya and Somalia signed a tripartite agreement facilitating the repatriation of refugees at the complex.
