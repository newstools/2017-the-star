A city tycoon and his wife have been excused from attending a court hearing so that they can travel to Dubai for their daughter’s wedding. Mohan Galot and his wife Santosh yesterday told Milimani law courts Magistrate Francis Andayi that they are not a flight risk. Lawyer Tom Ojienda told the court that this clients have cooperated  with the orders of the court before. “The couple will return to the country at the end of the year after the wedding,” Ojienda said. Andayi allowed them to skip the November 8 hearing. The two face fogery charges. Prosecutor Daniel Karuri had opposed their application, saying he had not been served with any documents.
