Police in Ol Kalou have appealed to anyone whose baby is lost to contact them. Police said a good Samaritan found a baby girl abandoned along the railway line at Kiyuu on Friday evening. The baby is approximately eight-months old. Danson Wachira and Angela Wambui found her wrapped in a lesso and blanket with her clothes placed near her. "We initially passed, not knowing it was a baby. After a few steps, she cried before we turned back and picked her," Machira said. He said the baby was wet as it had rained that afternoon. They took the baby to Ol Kalou police station before she was taken to J.M Memorial Hospital where she was confirmed to be in good health. She is currently at the hospital's pediatric ward. Police have also appealed to anyone with information regarding the baby to contact them. "Her parents and the reason they abandoned her are not known. No document to help in investigation was found on her," Nyandarua Central OCPD Wilson Kosgei said.
