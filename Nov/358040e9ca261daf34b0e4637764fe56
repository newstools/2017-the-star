Kenya’s Visiline Jepkesho leads the a competitive field in the women’s category of the Vodafone Istanbul Marathon tomorrow in Turkey.  Istanbul welcomes a fast women’s field, headlined by Jepkesho who produced a huge PB in Paris this year of 2:21:37, slicing more than three minutes off her previous best set also in Paris two years ago. Kenyan compatriot Sharon Jemutai Cherop is also an outstanding athlete on the start list with a personal best time of 2:22:28 but this time was achieved back in 2013, and the Kenyan will be running her first marathon after maternity leave.  The 33-year-old still has the potential to surprise the rest of the field. The women’s race will also feature Diana Lobacevske of Lithuania, 17th in Rio Olympic Games, who was the best ranked European at the London Marathon this year,  finishing in 2:28:48, and Kenya’s Ruth Chepngetich, winner of Istanbul Half Marathon with 1:06:19 seven months ago, who will step up the distance and run her marathon debut.  Last year’s winner Agnes Jeruto Barsosio has been forced to withdraw from the race due to injury. The Istanbul Marathon women’s race record and the Turkish all-comers record stands at 2:27:27, and was run by Ethiopia’s Ashu Kasim Rabo also in 2010. Kenya’s Phillip Kangongo leads the Kenyan men’s field. Kangongo clocked 2:08:16 at the 2015 Barcelona Marathon. Others include Ezekiel Kemboi Omullo, who set his 2:08:55 PB in Warsaw last year and the consistent veteran Kenneth Mburu Mungara, who holds a 2:07:36 PB from 2011. Paul Koech Kipsiele, one of the fastest 3,000m steeplechase runners in history, is set to run the second marathon of his career. Following a half marathon debut of 1:01:03 in March, Koech ran 2:12:02 in Rotterdam in April, a moderate performance for his potential. The fastest ever athlete on the start line tomorrow will be Bazu Worku of Ethiopia, who has a 2:05:25 from Berlin in 2010. The 27-year-old ran 2:08:48 this year in Prague where he finished second. Kaan Kigen Özbilen carries home hopes in Istanbul. Özbilen, who has a PB of 2:06:10 from Seoul last year, was 17th at the Rio Olympic Games, and finished 14th at the IAAF World Championships in London this year. The defending champion, Evans Kiplagat of Azerbaijan, will be back as well. The 29-year-old, who hasn’t raced in a marathon nearly one year, will be eager to top the podium again.  Kiplagat’s most recent appearance in Istanbul was the Half Marathon in April, which he finished in a time of 1:01:47.
