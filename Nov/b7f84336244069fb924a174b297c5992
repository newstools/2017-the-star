Journalists in Nyandarua have been urged not to write negative stories about the county.  Nyandarua assembly majority leader Kamau Gathungu said negative publicity is harmful and, saying it contributes to residents ejecting leaders during elections.  Gathungu spoke on Tuesday during the swearing-in of Nyandarua executive members at the county headquarters.  “We humbly request you to give positive publicity about Nyandarua. Negative publicity is harming us,” he said. Gathungu said leaders would want a 100 per cent of the MCAs reelected in the next election.  He urged journalists to remember they too are children of Nyandarua and what they publish affects them too.  Gathungu said the current crop of leaders gave a lot of hope to the people of Nyandarua during the campaigns.  He said the Nyandarua assembly cares for residents “and I promise that we are going to deliver”.
