Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago wants IG Joseph Boinnet to investigate the alleged illegal misuse of Kenya Railways Corporation wagons to transport illicit brew from Uganda into the country. Mandago said some KRC staff and the railway police are involved in the illegal cross-border business. The governor yesterday said the trains offload the brew in bushes along the railway line between the two countries.  He said he will lead a crackdown to arrest those involved if Bonnet does not act. "We will raid them in the bush and stop the train," Mandago said. The governor said his team is already following up the matter. He spoke when he launched the Wellness Week for the staff of his county. Â
