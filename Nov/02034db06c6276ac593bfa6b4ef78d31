Police are investigating reports that local politicians are fuelling and funding feuds between farmers and herders in Lamu. The politicians are said to be inciting the two sides to fight. Conflicts between farmers and herders over pasture in Witu, Katsaka Kairu, Maisha Masha, Jipendeni, Moa, Hongwe and Hindi have become rife in recent days. Speaking in Lamu yesterday, county commissioner Gilbert Kitiyo and county commander Muchangi Kioi said police were following crucial leads. Herders are accused of deliberately grazing their livestock on private property.Farmers fare retaliating by cutting the animals with pangas.  “We won’t allow politicians to play games with people’s lives and peace in this region. It’s selfish for anyone to do such a thing. People should learn where to draw the line when it comes to playing politics,” Kitiyo said.
