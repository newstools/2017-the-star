Airtel registered a profit before tax of Sh9.5 billion ($ 92 million) from its 15 African operations for the period ended September 30, a recovery from a Sh2 billion loss ($20 million) posted over a similar period last year. For the period, revenues grew by 3 per cent to reach Sh83.8 billion ($809m), from Sh81.9 billion ($790m), attributed to increased data and Airtel Money usage. Aggregate revenue per user dropped from Sh342.17 to Sh 331.81 during the period under review while the firms’ earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization recorded a 44.24 per cent increase from Sh18.76 billion reported last year to Sh 27.06 billion. During the quarter, the company had an aggregate customer base of 81.9 million as compared to 78.1 million in the corresponding quarter last year, an increase of 4.8 per cent. Data customers now represent 26.5 per cent of the total customer base, as compared to 23.1 per cent in the corresponding quarter last year, with usage per customer recording a 51.9 per cent growth to 1,018 megabytes from 670 megabytes recorded last year. The customers increased during the quarter by 20.1 per cent to 21.7 million as compared to 18.1 million in the corresponding quarter last year. The total customer base using the Airtel Money platform increased by 3.5 per cent to 9.5 million users as compared to 9.1 million in the corresponding quarter last year. “Our focus on acquiring quality customers has resulted in a lower customer churn for the quarter at 4.9 per cent as compared to 5.3 per cent in the corresponding quarter last year,” the financial statement posted on the global website said. Though silent on specific countries’ performances like Kenya, the statement indicated the company is scaling down its operations in the continent. For instance, the number of employees has dropped from 4,058 to 3,737, an 8 per cent drop. Capital expenditure has also been slashed by more than half from Sh10.57 billion ($102m) to Sh5.18 billion ($50m) in the period under review. The company had 20,305 network towers at end of the quarter as compared to 19,866 network towers in the corresponding quarter last year, the financial statement showed.
