More than 50 Pentecostal churches in Nyeri yesterday disowned NCCK secretary general Peter Karanja’s call for including the opposition in government. The clergymen spoke at Full Gospel Church of Kenya, Nyeri. On Tuesday, Karanja called for creation of the offices of Prime Minister, two deputies the leader of the opposition. Churches under the umbrella Nyeri Pentecostal Movement criticised the statement, saying they were never consulted. They called it wishful thinking. Officials Bishops Wachira Karani, Erastus Njoroge and Lawrence Kariuki said Karanja’s opinion is his own. “Advice to the government should be made constitutionally. This is not possible,” Karani said. “The suggestions are ill-advised. They shouldn’t drag in churches because this will create more chaos. Let us think about all candidates who were in the race and not only one,” Njoroge said. Kariuki appealed to political leaders not to burn the country. The churches also urged the state to avoid piecemeal amendments to the Constitution through Parliament, but involve all Kenyans in a referendum. On Tuesday Karanja also called for dialogue between President Uhuru Kenyatta and NASA leader Raila Odinga, saying it will help reduce ethnic tensions. The secretary general said the position of leader of opposition will provide dignity for the opposition and make it effective in holding the government to account. He suggested the PM and the deputies will sit in the Cabinet and may answer questions in Parliament.
