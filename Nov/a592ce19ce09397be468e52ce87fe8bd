A little known man has caused a stir among Kenyans after witnessing two major accidents in the country in a span of less than two weeks. Dennis Muigai Ngengi was a centre of interest after photos and clips of him circulated on Tuesday. This was after he recounted the accident that claimed the life of Nyeri Governor Wahome Gakuru. Ngengi was also a witness in the last month's Lake Nakuru chopper crash where pilot Apollo Malowa and others died. During the Lake Nakuru incident, Ngengi introduced himself as a "State Pilot". In a video aired by a local TV station, he said the late pilot was "a friend of ours, who we loved, and that's why I'm here." In the two incidents, Ngengi is captured donning bluetooth sunglasses mostly seen by security personnel attached to leaders.

"The accident occurred after the governor's driver was confused by a motorbike rider who was carrying those meat boxes," he said.  "So, while avoiding to hit the rider, the governor's driver swerved off the road, and that’s when they rammed into the rail." Ngengi said that he noticed the tyres fly off the car after his car slowed some meters away. Efforts to get his identity and job description proved futile as most government and state officials dismissed him as a witness. The mystery surrounding Ngengi is yet to unravel but only time will tell. Read: Senators eulogise Wahome Gakuru, plead for unity among leaders
