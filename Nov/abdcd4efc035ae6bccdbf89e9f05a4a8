Fishermen and residents of Homa Bay want Governor Cyprian Awiti to fulfill his election pledge of reviving the Capital Fish Factory. During the campaign, Awiti also promised to build another plant in Mbita subcounty. Awiti, who was reelected a second term, pledged to build fish cooling plants to reduce loses. Speaking at Koginga Beach, fishermanTimothy Owino said the closure of the factory has hurt business. They are forced to sell their fish to middlemen at a loss. Capital Fish Factory, which processed Nile perch, collapsed five years ago. Homa Bay residents who worked in the factory are out of work. Crime and insecurity have risen, especially in the town.  Homa Bay Bunge La Wananchi speaker Walter Opiyo said it is sadthat, despite a chunk of Lake Victoria falling in the county, there is no functioning fish factory. “Our county government should fulfil the promises they made during campaigns by investing in the fishing industry.  “Other people from other regions should not be the ones  benefitting from our sweat while our fishermen are wallowing in poverty,” he said.
