A 35-year-old KCSE candidate was Friday stabbed to death by his wife in Ikuu village, Igembe South, Meru county. Jacob Mithika had returned home after his exams at Karumaru Secondary when he picked a quarrel with his wife. Neighbours said Mithika had asked his wife for some Sh20,000 which he had given her to keep. A fight then ensued after the woman declined to give the cash. "The wife asked him to stop beating her so that she could produce the money. But when he released her, she grabbed a knife and stabbed him several times," resident Rodgers Munene said. Mithika died as he was being rushed to Maua Methodist Hospital. Area assistant chief Simon Mutua, who is also brother to the deceased, said Mithika had had family problems with his wife since he rejoined school in 2014. Neighbours claimed the wife, who remains at large, had also attacked a woman at a local market, saying she had an affair with her husband.
