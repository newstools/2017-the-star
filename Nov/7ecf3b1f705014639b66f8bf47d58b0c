Celebrations erupted in Mumias as the Supreme Court upheld the election of President Uhuru Kenya on November 26.
Jovial Jubilee supporters danced and sang in Shianda, Mumias East constituency.
After Chief Justice David Maraga read the verdict, JP supporters in National Assembly Majority Chief Whip Benjamin Washiali's home turf sang Jubilee songs and chanted party slogans.
They were led by Mumias East subcounty branch chairman Ibrahim Azenze and youth leader Godfery Lutomia.
“The courts have proved we elected our dear President fairly,” a Jubilee supporter said.
They exuded confidence Kenyans will get more development during Uhuru's second term. In Mumias East, Uhuru got 7,999 votes during the presidential rerun.
The President should reconcile the nation by incorporating everyone in his government, Jubilee supporters said.  “We appeal to him to reach out to the Opposition. Let him put the nation first, let him unite us,” Anzenze said. However, NASA supporters were unhappy with the ruling.
“We don’t recognise Uhuru Kenyatta as our President,” one supporter said.
The Opposition supporters said they are waiting for their party leader Raila Odinga to give them the way forward.
“We will remain peaceful. When Baba speaks, we will follow him,” said another NASA supporter.
