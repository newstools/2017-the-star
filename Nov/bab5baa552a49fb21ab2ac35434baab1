The National Parents Association and Muslim preachers want the state to expand day schools in anticipation of increased enrolment when free secondary education is introduced next year.  The association’s chairman Nicholas Maiyo and the preachers’ chairman, Abubakar Bini, told the Star in Eldoret on Friday many schools lack facilities and have a shortage of teachers. “We urge the government to implement free secondary education and employ more teachers,” Bini said. Maiyo said schools will offer quality education if facilities are improved. He wants Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i to be retained in the position when President Uhuru Kenyatta forms a new government after being sworn in on Tuesday. Let him continue with the critical reforms he has initiated, he said.  Maiyo said the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education examination was credible. He said even though it is the prerogative of the President to appoint people of his choice, parents want him to retain Matiang’i in the Education ministry. He has done a good job. Maiyo said they are happy with the Kenya National Examinations Council’s performance. He praised Matiang’i’s efforts to eliminate exam cheating. “We have made great strides in the fight against cheating. Parents thank CS Matiangi, exam officials and candidates,” Maiyo said. He said it takes a person with a vision and dedication to bring change. Parents welcome the President’s order to have special exams for candidates who miss papers.
