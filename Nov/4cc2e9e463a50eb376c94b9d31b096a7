Calm has
returned to Moyale, Marsabit county, following an attack that left one person
with serious injuries on Tuesday. A boda boda rider from neighbouring Mandera was attacked by unknown people,
sparking fears of retaliatory attacks in the Northern region. Marsabit
county commissioner Michael Mwangi said the victim is a resident of Elwak,
Mandera county. Mwangi said
on Friday that the person was recovering at an hospital in Moyale
and that police were searching for his attackers. He said calm had been restored in the border area. "The area is
peaceful. We are trying our best to eliminate criminal elements that are trying to
cause insecurity," he said. "Security
officers moved with speed to prevent retaliatory attacks and maintain
peace." The
administrator said the motive of the attack had not been established as the
attackers did not steal anything. Moyale MCA
Kiya Chana said elders from the border area will meet to prevent retaliatory
attacks and broker peace among warring communities. But Chana said
tension was still high on Moyale's Biashara Street on Saturday. He called
for a multi-agency approach to combat insecurity in the area. Unconfirmed reports indicated seven people were wounded when violence broke out in the town on Thursday,  Resident Hassu Abdullahi said two warring communities - Garri and Borana - clashed for two hours from 10am to noon, making matters worse.
