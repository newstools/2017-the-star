Police are hunting for eight hardcore criminals blamed for rising crime in Eldoret over two months. The eight are members of a gang that has been terrorising residents and even targetting police officers, police said. Two suspects shot dead on Saturday in the town are members of the gang. Police recovered a Ceska pistol with nine bullets.  “The two had earlier been arrested and had agreed to surrender the gun they had hidden, but they suddenly turned against police officers,” Eldoret West police boss Samwel Mutunga said.  The two were shot dead at Macharia estate.  Mutunga said the two were on the wanted list of criminals linked to a series of robberies. “When police arrived at the house, one suspect picked an axe and another one dashed for the pistol. That is when they were gunned down,” he said.
