The government has ruled out maize importation from neighbouring countries despite facing a deficit of eight million bags. Agriculture PS Richard Lesiyampe said the government will instead encourage local farmers to sell their produce to the National Cereals and Produce Board by offering better prices. Lesiyampe said projections indicate that farmers would produce 36 million bags. Kenya has always imported maize from neighbouring states to plug the gap between demand and supply. “Kenyans consume an average of 48 million bags of maize against a production of 40 million bags annually. It is time we resolved this,” Lesiyampe said during a workshop in Naivasha yesterday.
