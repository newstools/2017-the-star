The National Transport and Safety Authority was on Friday night awarded the best innovative enterprise in 2017 in the just-concluded East Africa’s 2017 CIO100 Awards. According to Joseph Sevilla, director at iLab and one of the awards judges, NTSA scooped the top accolade following its brilliance in implementing Transport Information Management System. The system is a self-help portal where any Kenyan can access any service offered by NTSA anywhere so long as they have internet connection. During the awards, the regulator’s head of information technology Fernando Wangila scooped the CIO of the year Award across the east Africa region. The NTSA management system was envisioned in 2008 by a multi-stakeholder group led by the Ministry of Transport through a multi-agency initiative to enhance road safety on Kenyan roads. Other winners during the awards included Barclays Bank of Kenya-financial sector, Longhorn Publishers-manufacturing sector, Multichoice-media sector award, NSSF Uganda-health sector and Kitui county-local government award, among others. The East Africa CIO100 Awards began over seven years ago.
