Mango farmers are staring at losses after heavy rains rendered most Elgeyo Marakwet roads impassable, disrupting transport. Travellers said passenger buses and several lorries ferrying mangoes have overturned while others are stuck on the Liter-Arror Road. Calvin Jepchumba said passengers were stranded on Thursday and Friday night on the roads. Jepchumba, also a mango trader, said he has been transporting mangoes from Liter, Marakwet East, since Thursday and had not reached the market by Saturday. He said on Saturday the lorry ferrying the mangoes to markets in Nakuru and Nairobi got stuck at least twice in the mud. “Our lorry got stuck twice in Soko Bora on Thursday night and we are stuck again in Arror. We have incurred a lot of expenses in hiring youths to push the lorry out of the mud,” Jepchumba said.
