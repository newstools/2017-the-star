Eutelsat-owned satellite broadband service provider Konnect Africa has rolled out a new hotspot service aimed at increasing internet connectivity in rural areas. “In leveraging the ubiquity of our satellite network and locally operated hotspots we will foster more productive uses of digital technology to make everyday tasks easier for individuals and allow businesses in more remote areas to expand their footprint,” Konnect Africa CEO Laurent Grimaldi said in a statement. SmartWIFI will leverage on the firm’s strong network to enable sales outlets such as retailers, gas stations, schools, healthcare centres and the hospitality industry to become connectivity points for their surrounding communities. Users will be able to access the internet from several hundred metres around the hotspot and access can be extended to several kilometres through off-the-shelf Wi-Fi repeaters. “This new Wi-Fi hotspot solution is designed specifically to address the needs of the majority of the African population that live in rural areas, where there is a need to reduce the digital divide,” he said. The new hotspot service will be deployed in partnership with local Internet service providers and telecom operators across SubSaharan Africa.
