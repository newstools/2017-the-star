Kilifi county is set to host its first international film festival in Malindi. It will bring together filmmakers and stars from Africa and farther afield. The week-long international fete called ‘Malindi International Film Festival’ is expected to revive the tourism sector in Malindi. Mining CS Dan Kazungu, who is behind the festival, said a mock fete will be held in March ahead of the grand event in December 2018. Kazungu said he initiated the idea of the festival in 2015 and has pushed the government and private sector to make it a reality. He said the film sector is a major revenue earner for many countries, raking in billions of dollars worldwide annually. Nigeria, the US and France have gained world recognition for their film festivals.
