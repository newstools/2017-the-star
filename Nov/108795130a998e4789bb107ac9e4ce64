Leaders from Western have thanked residents for ignoring calls from NASA to boycott the Presidential election. They said despite threats, residents turned up in large numbers to vote. Led by Water CS Eugene Wamalwa, the leaders criticised calls to boycott some products said to be affiliated to Jubilee, adding that voter turnout in the election was impressive. The leaders spoke at the end of a two-day retreat at Kongoni Lodge, Naivasha, at the weekend. They promised to support the national government. Wamalwa said all polling stations were open in Western, unlike in neighbouring Nyanza. He admitted that the voter turnout was low compared to the General Election. The CS said the outcome is normal and was expected. “The number of those who turned up for the repeat election was lower by a few thousands, but we are proud,” the CS added. Wamalwa praised residents for maintaining the peace while they voted and ignoring calls by NASA to boycott the election.  Former Budalang’i MP Ababu Namwamba said amid threats and intimidation, residents turned up in large numbers to vote. “As leaders from Western Kenya we are very proud of the work and turn-out by our people in re-electing President Uhuru Kenyatta,” he said.
