Shinyalu MP Justus Kizito has accused the Jubilee administration of “playing” with Kenya’s education for political relevance. Kizito said it is unfortunate President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto are using education to win support. “They lied to Kenyans since 2013 that they will supply laptops to our children in schools and to date you all know what has happened,” he said.
