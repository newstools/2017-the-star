Daddy Owen has brushed aside allegations he never paid artiste Denno for the hit collabo they did together in 2012, Mbona. This is after a friend of Denno claimed the blind artiste is living in poverty after being denied the royalties. Speaking to Word Is, Daddy Owen said, "When I heard the allegations, I decided to keep quiet because I knew the truth and I knew it will come out and it did. You see if I commented on that then I could have looked like we are of the same level." Last year, Daddy Owen denied owing Denno any money, telling the Nairobian he had "met Denno's family and settled everything". Â
