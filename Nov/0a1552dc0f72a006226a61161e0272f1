Some Meru MCAs in areas affected by floods have asked the National Disaster Management Authority and wellwishers for help. The MCAs are Elius Murega (Municipality) and county assembly deputy speaker David Kithia (Akithi), Priscilla Kithia (Nkomo), Generosa Wamati (Igembe East) and Joshua Mutethia (nominated). Kithia said with impassable roads and floods, Nkomo residents are the worst hit as it is impossible to escape marauding elephants that appear frequently. Nyaki East politician Titus Mutugi said the situation is worsening at Karurimo stream and Kathithi since the villagers cannot access the nearest medical facility. The rains have displaced residents, swept away crops, rendered roads impassable and caused deaths. Murega said business people at Gakoromone market are counting losses after floodwaters damaed their shops. Kaithia said the rains have wreaked havoc, especially in Limbine, Thinyaine and Ithalene, where two children drowned last week. A check by the Star on Meru-Maua highway showed impassable areas in Kaithe, Kianjai, Ngundune, Muthara and Mutiukuuma. Kagaene market area is also impassable on the Meru-Mikinduri Road. A lot of water and mud have blocked the road. “I ask the national emergency department, the disaster management, the Kenya Red Cross and well wishers to help the displaced families. They need toiletries, mosquito nets and clothes,” Kithia said. He called on the Kenya Rural Roads Authority and Kenya National Highway Authority to fast track drainage repair and remove silt. The most affect areas area parts of Igembe, Tigania East and Tigania West.  In Igembe and Tigania, many homesteads do not have domestic or irrigation water. Kiorimba senior chief Silas Ikiao said heavy rains has caused rivers to swell, making it impossible to cross.
