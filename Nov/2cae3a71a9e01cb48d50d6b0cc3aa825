Former Nyeri woman rep Priscilla Nyokabi has asked the new Nyeri governor, Mutahi Kahiga, for a job. “Give me a job. I’m now jobless, but very ready to serve if given an opportunity,” she said. Nyokabi spoke during former Governor Wahome Gakuru’s memorial service at the Dedan Kimathi University of Technology auditorium on Tuesday. Kahiga was present. He had just finished addressing the audience when he noticed Nyokabi had arrived at the auditorium and gave her a chance to speak. He introduced her as a prominent lawyer. She did not specify which job she is interested in. The biggest post at the moment, however, is that of deputy governor. The Constitution is silent on how the position should be filled after the occupant takes over as governor. A Bill to seal the loophole is before Parliament.
