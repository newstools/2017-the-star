Diego Rafiki, the Burundian owner of the cargo ship whose Kenyan crew has been detained in Indonesia for illegal stay, has agreed to pay Sh510,000 fine for the five sailors. International Transport Workers Federation inspector in charge of East Africa Betty Makena yesterday told the Star Rafiki is ready to pay the fine, but after the government requests it. “We talked yesterday [Monday] and he asked us, through the Kenya Maritime Authority, to write to his lawyer first. So we are waiting to see if he will honour his pledge,” she said on the phone. Rafiki on Saturday told the Star he is not responsible for the five sailors after they abandoned his ship two months ago. But the sailors told the Star they had to look for help after Rafiki failed to buy them food for more than 10 days. They are Captain Mzee Khamis, Mapinga Mwalimu (bosun), Yusuf Omar (greaser), Tela Juma (cook) and Aggrey Diedi (electrician) have been staying at the Indonesian immigration offices for three days now. “But the immigration officers now want the crew out of their premises. They want them moved to an alternative accommodation,” Makena said. The Indonesian immigration authorities had given the sailors up to Monday to pay the fine.
