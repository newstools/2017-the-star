The Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital will build 500 new housing units at Kiplombe for doctors and other staff, CEO Wilson Aruasa said on Friday. Speaking during the unveiling of a kidney unit at MTRH, Aruasa said the project is aimed at ensuring security for staff. A doctor at the hospital was last week found murdered in his house in Eldoret. The project will start in January. “The site has already been surveyed and demarcated and contractors are in the process of planning how to implement it,” Aruasa said.
