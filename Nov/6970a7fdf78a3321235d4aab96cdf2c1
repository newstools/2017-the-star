The examination council wants adequate security provided in examination centres today ahead of NASA’s planned march and rally in Nairobi. The rally will be a “rehearsal” to welcome NASA leader Raila Odinga, who is expected to jet back into the country tomorrow, after being away for close to two weeks. Raila has been in the US since last week on Tuesday for meetings with top bureaucrats and Congress officials, as well as Kenyans living in the Diaspora as he seeks support to push for his electoral reforms agenda. In a letter addressed to Interior PS, Karanja Kibicho, Kenya National Examination Council chairperson George Magoha said there is need to reinforce security in examination centres as previous politically-charged activities had led to disruption of routine businesses. “Unfortunately, the march will coincide with the ongoing Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education examination, which is taking place countrywide. I kindly request you to provide adequate security at all examination centres to ensure the exams are not interfered with,” the letter reads.  Yesterday, candidates sat Kiswahili Paper 3 (Fasihi) and Geography Paper I. Today they will sit Biology Paper II and Agriculture Paper I. According to Magoha, the exams have so far been going on well. There are few cases of cheating.  He warned those planning to engage in cheating that they will face the music.
