  Comedian JB has finally broken his silence and addressed ongoing reports that he is a bad father and husband to radio presenter Tina Kaggia. Tina went on a TV interview and narrated how life with the comedian led to depression and at some point she almost committed suicide. "We started having those episodes of a lot of dishonesty and abandonment. Then there are these kids with many questions that mummy keeps lying about and they [episodes of abandonment] kept recurring and I was like, 'You know what, you call my bluff one more time and that is it!' He did not think I was serious," Tina said. That was when she walked out of the marriage with her kids. To date, JB doesn't know where Tina and the kids live. JB Masanduku had earlier posted a photo hanging out with actress Leisly Njenga and captioned it, "#favouritehuman." It is not clear if he has already moved on and started another relationship. Yesterday, he sought to address the claims that Tina levelled against him in the media interviews and all he posted was a selfie with Tina with the statement, "I don't know what the fuss is about. I wouldn't do this to Tina Kaggia..." Fans reacted to the post. ndindathequeen: You're just messed up! Get some help! moraaonyancha: Jb before you can say all you wanna say ...guilty or innocent ask for forgiveness!!!
