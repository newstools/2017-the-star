Bebe Cool’s friend and singer Dizzy Nuts, born Denis Oscar
Mubuuke, was laid to rest at his ancestral home in Uganda. The singer
was involved in a hit-and-run accident believed to have targeted Bebe Cool's life. The two had just performed at a club called Victoria
Pub when a Toyota Harrier knocked Dizzy. He was standing outside the car
talking to Bebe Cool, who was inside his Hummer. Kato Hassan, Bebe’s friend was also affected by the accident and is currently hospitalised. In an social media post, the Mbozi za Malwa hit maker narrated the incident: “A speeding car
with tinted Windows that had earlier parked at a bank opposite to where i
had parked mine at a distance (as narrated by eye witnesses),without
lights which totally seemed planned to hit me last night after my gig
claimed the life of a young man,a brother,a father,a friend of so many. It also knocked another friend of mine Kato Hassan breaking his leg and fore head but his condition is being managed so far. The body of the late has been taken to his fathers home in kireka for viewing tonight,tomorrow he will be taken to Kayabwe Masaka road where he will be put to rest. He could have been useless to those who executed this plan but he was a human being and a father. Judgement is done by Allah not man and we all shall follow the same road,the only difference is who goes first and how. Rest in peace my brother OSCAR MUBUKE aka DIZZY NATS GALIWANGO.” Fans, family, friends and celebrities described Dizzy as a disciplined yet talented man who observed principles in his work. Having divorced his wife, he leaves behind three children: Ceaser Kiguli, James Solomon
Kulumba and Sheebah Namitala.
