The national government, through the National Water Conservation and Pipeline Corporation, has begun sensitising Isiolo locals about the Sh20 billion dam project along River Ewaso Nyiro. The locals had opposed the project, which is part of Vision 2030. The dam is expected to supply water to three counties - Laikipia, Samburu and Isiolo. Residents of Laikipia and Samburu counties support the project. Isiolo politicians said residents who live downstream and who solely depend on the river will suffer during construction. Last Friday, Governor Mohamed Kuti visited the site in Oldonyiro ward.
