Kenya Electricity Generating Company is planning to set up a subordinate consultancy firm to boost its revenue generation as part of its revamped G2G (Good to Great) transformation strategy. The power generator aims to provide adequate returns for shareholders by targeting a return-on-invested-capital of 10 per cent and by profitably supplying cheaper green energy to the public. Dubbed KenGen C, the firm will be offering expert services in electricity generation, selling steam, geothermal consulting, heating and other related services across the continent while the mother firm will concentrate on its core business of energy generation. According to KenGen chairman Joshua Choge, the subordinate company will help KenGen deliver on its revamped G2G strategy which aims at exploring expansion opportunities beyond Kenya and will include the oil and mining sectors in the region since the company is also selling geothermal steam and commercial drilling services apart from power generation as it enlarges its range of products. The announcement comes barely a month after the firm announced a 34 per cent increase in net profit to Sh9.05 billion in 2016/2017 compared to Sh6.74 billion reported the previous year. Despite the profits, the firm will not be giving dividends to its shareholders for the second year running. Analysts believe that the announcement of revenue diversification is meant to calm bitter shareholders and give them hope of better prospects in future ahead of the companyâ€™s annual shareholder meeting slated for early December.
