Stanley Wahome may replace Halima Bakari as Mt Kenya University women’s team coach ahead of the last Kenya Volleyball Federation national league leg this Friday in Eldama Ravine. Bakari, who exited the institution last August to join Samaj Schools, was behind the formation of both men and women’s teams four years ago and the eventual promotion to the top tier. MKU sports coordinator, William Luta said the team, which is currently bottom on the log after a win-less run, have been without the coach for the last three months. In the meantime, the students have been forced to train under the stewardship of men’s coach John Oronje. “Plans are at the initial stage to get the services of Wahome and I cannot say much about the development at least for now. But in meantime, Oronje will double up as the team’s coach as we wait to see how things pan out,” said Luta. He continued: “We have just learned about the league being staged at Eldama Ravine and we hope to honour our fixtures. However, this will depend on whether we will be cleared in time for the event.” MKU women’s team will be up against league leaders Kenya Prisons, while their male counterparts who also lie last on standing with three points, take on Kenya Ports Authority and fast-improving Prisons Mombasa. Reached for comment, Oronje said: “The teams have prepared well ahead of the Friday’s matches and we hope to make a good account of ourselves.” He said the men’s team continues to show improvement in every league leg and hopes to end the league on high.
