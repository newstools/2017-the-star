Kenya Airways delayed eight flights on Monday as thick fog clouded Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi. KQ 600, KQ 480, KQ 400, KQ 410 and KQ 210 were pushed by an hour or less. KQ 604, KQ 482 and KQ 584 will experience short delays later in the day, the airline said via Twitter. "We regret any inconvenience and wish our guests pleasant flights." Aviation expert say pilots need a gap of 200 feet (61 metres) between the clouds and the ground to see the runway and land safely.
