Governors in the North Rift plan to revive stalled Sh100 billion projects in Kerio Valley which is affected by banditry. The projects are in Elgeyo Marakwet, Turkana, West Pokot, Baringo and Samburu. The governors are discussing how they will sustain peace and security. “There have been minimal incidents of insecurity in the region. We are now discussing the way forward," West Pokot Governor Simon Kachapin said. Last month he held a joint security meeting with his Elgeyo Marakwet counterpart Alex Tolgos. The two county chiefs spoke to the Star on the phone separately on Friday. Speaking in Eldoret, Baringo Governor Stanley Kiptis said security has improved in Baringo and other counties within the Kerio Valley.  Uasin Governor Jackson Mandago, who is chairman of the North Rift Economic Bloc, said they will use the forum to implement joint investments.
