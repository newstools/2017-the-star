The National Cohesion and Integration Commission is engaged in a countrywide after-polls peace forum to bring together Kenyans after the conflict-ridden elections. Speaking in Garissa town yesterday, commissioner Gitile Natuli said elections are over and Kenyans ought to support the government. He said other commissioners are involved in the peace forums in Western, Nyanza and Tana River. The country has witnessed an intense electioneering period after NASA flagbearer Raila Odinga refused to participate in the repeat polls on October 26. The August 8 presidential race results were nullified by the Supreme Court.  “Our message to Kenyans is that elections come and go. We need to support one another and build our country. There is a need for Kenyans to borrow from Zimbabwe, who had a change of guard without any violence,” Natuli said in a peace meeting at a Garissa hotel. The commissioner appealed to politicians to avoid inciting supporters. He said President Uhuru Kenyatta should unify the country, which has been divided along tribal lines. “Politicians should strive to unite all Kenyans instead of dividing us. Kenyans should understand that whether we supported Jubilee, once elected the President leads all of us and we should support him,” Natuli added. The commissioner defended the agency against accusations of being a toothless dog, saying there are many elected leaders who have been charged with hate speech.
