Former Homa Bay governor candidate Oyugi Magwanga’s witnesses have said his agents were evicted from a number of polling stations on August 8. Magwanga’s running mate Joshua Orero and his chief agent Kennedy Osutwa on Wednesday told the High Court in Homa Bay that the agents were also chased away during tallying. Orero said the agents were evicted from the polling stations to allow alteration of results to favour Governor Cyprian Awiti. Osutwa said many forms 37A were signed by people who pretended to be Magwanga’s (pictured) agents. “Our agents, who realised irregularities during tallying at polling stations, failed to sign forms 37A, but I later realised a number of the forms were signed by people who were not our agents,” Osutwa said. But the IEBC lawyers dismissed the statements, saying they were not served with the list of agents who were evicted from the stations.
