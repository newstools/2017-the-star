Girls in West Pokot county performed better than boys  in this year’s KCPE exam.  Girls have grappled with forced early marriage and female genital mutilation.  The top-scoring girl - Vivian Chepkech - is 13 years old. She studied at Kapenguria  Town View Academy. Chepkech scored 418 marks, beating  all the boys in the county.  Speaking to the Star yesterday, Chepkech said her ambition is to be a lawyer, adding hard work and discipline enabled her to emerge tops. Her father - James Kapellion - is a former MCA.  He said he had high expectations of his daughter. “In West Pokot county, we still have few professionals. We hope more students will join special courses to enable our county to compete with others,” Kapellion said.  Head teacher Danson Kangole said two girls and eight boys scored above 400 marks. At Jerusalem Academy in Chepareria, girls performed well too. Six girls scored above 400 marks.
