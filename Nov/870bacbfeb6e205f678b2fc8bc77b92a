Entertainer Nameless has said despite having a busy schedule just as his wife Wahu Kagwi, they always create time for the ir choldren. They have two daughters — Tumiso and Nyakio. They both have a demanding public life.  "I want them to pursue what they love and have a passion for. Whatever it will be," Nameless told Word Is. Asking him about the relationship that he and Wahu have with the kids, Nameless had something special to say. "It's very interesting because you want to keep a close relationship so they don't feel they need to hide anything from you. But at the same time, you have to make them respect you as a parent who knows what's best for them. We are trying our best to prepare her for that vulnerable time," he reveals. Nameless has recently been riding high with a string of releases, including "Inspire Me," and "Oh My", a patriotic song that has been receiving massive airplay.
