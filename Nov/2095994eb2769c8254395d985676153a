KCSE exams start today amid lack of enough facilities in most secondary schools in Kakamega. The Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education candidates finished rehearsals on Friday. The exam will run for three weeks. Many school heads have cited lack of laboratories, books and enough staff. Kenya Secondary Schools Heads Association Kakamega chairman Godfrey Owuor has asked the national government to focus on developing infrastructure and improve the quality of education. “Good results are associated with how equipped a learning institution is. We should have better plans and infrastructure to raise students’ grades” Owour said. The St Peter’s Mumias High School principal said some schools cannot afford lab equipment, chemicals, teachers and books for students. “In my school I need two science labs urgently, with at least two more classrooms for each form to decongest the classrooms,” Owuor said. The principals’ head said the Education ministry should do more than disburse a little money for the subsidised tuition fees. “The truth is that the funds set aside for tuition are too little,” Owour said. The principal said many school heads have accumulated a lot of debt this year and expect next year to be worse.  The Jubilee administration has allocated Sh24.8 billion for free secondary education in the supplementary budget to be implemented from January.
