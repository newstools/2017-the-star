The top leadership wrangles bedeviling the African Independent Pentecostal Church of Africa have trickled down to a church in Nyandarua North. Archbishop Julius Njoroge has appointed Bishop Suleiman Kimani to lead
Nyakiambi AIPCA, while Archbishop Fredrick Wang'ombe has appointed
Bishop Ayub Kigotho. Kimani and Kigotho, to assert their authority, have appointed their supporters to lead the congregation. On Sunday, however, Paul Kariuki was locked out of the church by Kimani's faction for supporting Kigotho. Deacon Mugo from Ndaragwa was said to have been assigned by Kimani to take charge. Police stood guard at the church as the situation threatened to degenerate into chaos.  Eventually, Njoroge's faction worshipped outside the church, while Wang'ombe's held service in the building.  Some members said the church should be closed until the leaders solve their differences. Â
