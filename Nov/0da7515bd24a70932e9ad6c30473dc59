Two leaders in Laikipia have condemned the killing of cattle police. Laikipia Senator John Kinyua and Laikipia West MP Patrick Mariru, however, said the number of dead animals were not more than 300. “It is untrue that more than 300 cows were shot dead. Our estimation and that of police, is that around 25 cows were killed. The illegal herders used the cows as shield as they engaged police in the shootout,” Mariru told the press at Parliament Buildings yesterday. Mariru faulted local leaders and senior politicians, calling for herders compensation. He said 50 people, including six policemen, had died and 80 others were injured due to cattle rustling in the area. “Do Kenyans know that 50 people have died and 80 of them injured in the hands of herdsmen? We are clear that the rule of law must be followed,” Mariru said. He said more than 300,000 animals have been stolen by rustlers from the neighbouring counties of Baringo, Isiolo and Samburu.  “Who owns these cows that were allegedly shot by police? We have reasons to believe they are owned by politicians and senior government officials in this country. They are not owned by the boys who graze them,” Mariru said. Kinyua said they will hold peace meetings in the county to quell tension. He said a meeting has been scheduled between leaders from West Pokot, Laikipia, Samburu, Baringo, Samburu and Isiolo to foster peace.
