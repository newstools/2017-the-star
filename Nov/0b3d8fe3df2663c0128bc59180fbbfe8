Popular Kenyan DJ Hypnotiq is a father of one. He and his baby mama, Renee Wambui, work together to co-parent. Recently, Renee posted a long blog about how gruelling it was giving birth to her son. It left her with a perforated caecum - this is a large tubelike structure in the lower abdominal cavity that receives undigested food material from the small intestine and is considered the first region of the large intestine. This condition saw her undergo three surgeries and be isolated from her newborn child as she recuperated. "I hated seeing how I moved from glowing to swelling up and becoming ashy, bedridden, on machines and dehydrated. Three weeks after I was out of hospital, I chose to live a very positive and grateful life, I mean seeing a group of top medical specialists call my family members in a room while I was in HDU (High Dependency Unit) showed they were being prepared for my death and their facial reactions after leaving the room were proof enough that only God could work a miracle." Renee continued in her journal-like blog: "3am I watched someone cough and die and sadly my nosey self chose to watch the whole ordeal. Was I next?"  That was not over, a few days before her birthday she was in hospital again. "I went to hospital and my surgeon informed me that my stomach walls had collapsed and I had abdominal hernia and that he needed to schedule an immediate surgery before my intestines started tangling up. What to do but accept and pray for the best, but hearing him say this was a risky procedure made me go home, hold my son tight and enjoy his presence. I CRIED BITTERLY, prayed and went to hospital the next day, 3 hours in I came out alive, in so much pain, but alive."
