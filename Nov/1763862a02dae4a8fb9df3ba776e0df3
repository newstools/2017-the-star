Most times the road to fame in the music industry starts with a proper hit song, one that will take over playlists and get lots of airplay.  A year ago, Third Hand Music must, conceivably, have been the most anxious boy band in town. Their debut release, “Helena” didn’t bring much their way. Instead, it simply initiated their careers. For over three years, Third Hand Music have invested their time and dough in making melodious music. The trio, compromising singer Collins Kemboi, bass vocalist Michael Mwikamba and instrumentalist Ken-Al bert Orwa, has had a modicum of success in the Kenyan pop scene, but are yet to break into the ranks of top artistes. They’ve not pounded out quite an extensive catalogue yet, but what they’ve released and done is enough to put them on the spot. They are made of impressive resilience and zeal, qualities that have gradually earned them presence.  Undeniably, the band has a knack for creating music with reflective verses and soaring hooks with an introspective edge. Their lyrics express a characteristic intimacy and vulnerability they’ve cultivated over time. Their ability to alternatively use their vocal ranges to spice up their music might be their greatest quality. The boy band has been around and about offering their steadily growing fanbase quality live music performances, an art they seem to have mastered. What’s fueling the band is their ability to transcend genre classifications and do justice to their own tracks and tracks they cover.  In a moment that most new artistes seem afraid to go off script, Third Hand Music are a contradiction. Still in their formative years, we expect that if they keep doing what they do best, they stand a good chance of being one of the most impactful music groups in the country. Until then, all we have to do is wait.
