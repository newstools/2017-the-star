The former St. Christopher Secondary School, Bungoma player, however, said she will always be available and open to national duties call up. “Of course, I have the blessings from my club, Kenya pipeline. I have taken a one year unpaid leave and when the year elapses, I will see what to do going forward,” said Makokha, who played for Kenya Commercial Bank and Nairobi Water before joining Kenya Pipeline in 2014. She added: “It’s all about getting exposure and experience. I am glad I have the chance to play in Poland and I believe the lessons I will pick while out there will impact the national team and my club altogether when I return.” Makokha is also a beach volleyball player and recently participated in the FIVB World Championship in Vienna, Austria alongside Naomi Too.
