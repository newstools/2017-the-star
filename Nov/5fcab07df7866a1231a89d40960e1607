Property worth thousands was razed in Kabati estate, Naivasha, on Tuesday night after two teenagers fought over a phone message. James Kimani, a witness, said the two fought over an SMS sent to the phone as each claimed it was his. One of the teenagers sustained injuries to his head and back. As he went to report the matter to police, his counterpart set a mattress in the house on fire. "He lit the mattress to discipline him over his actions but the fire spread fast to other wooden houses resulting in heavy losses," Kimani said. "The fire department was alerted early enough and although they arrived in time, nothing could be salvaged owing to strong winds." A police officer who sought anonymity said they were looking for the one who lit the fire. "At the moment we have alerted Red Cross and other well wishers to help the victims find a place to live. A manhunt is on for the suspect," the officer added. Related: Two children killed in fire incident at Kimumu, Eldoret Click here for the latest political news
