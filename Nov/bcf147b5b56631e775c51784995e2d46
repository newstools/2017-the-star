Meru residents on Monday night gathered in the town to celebrate President Uhuru Kenyatta’s win in the October 26 polls. The residents, who were watching the announcement of the winner in various outlets in town, burst into celebration immediately Uhuru was declared winner. There was pomp and colour in the CBD as supporters donned in Jubilee colours chanted party slogans. Barack Muriuki said Uhuru should be sworn in quickly and proceed with work. “We want peace in our country and we want to return to our normal lives. Kenyans voted on August 8 and have now voted again. We urge the opposition to concede defeat,” he said.
