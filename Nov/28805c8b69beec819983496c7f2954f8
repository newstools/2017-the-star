The NGOs' board has banned all operations of 'Kura Yangu Sauti Yangu' and 'We The People' lobby groups for reasons including funding and alleged illegal operations. Fazul Mahamed, executive director of the NGOs Co-ordination Board chairman, said in a letter dated November 6 that the organisations got Sh36 million from the George Soros Foundation. "It is alleged that a transfer of Sh36 million was made to Kura Yangu Sauti Yangu and We the People...for purposes of funding political and flagitious operations in the country," he states. The letter was addressed to George Kegoro and copied to KHRC, International Commission of Jurists and International Centre for Policy and Conflict. Kegoro is vice chair of Kenya Human Rights Commission. Fazul further accuses KYSY and We The People of opening and operating illegal accounts with NIC and Citi banks, against section 12(4) of NGOs Coordination Act, 1990. He also says the two groups have employed foreigners, contrary to provisions of Kenyan Citizenship and Immigration Act, 2012, and notes their activities are supposed to be charitable. Fazul said the two bodies were operation as an amorphous camarilla  Camarilla is defined as a group of favourites who surround a king or ruler.  Usually, they do not hold any office or have any official authority but influence their ruler behind the scenes. The organisations have been asked to cease all political operations and all election-related programmes. They were also ordered to end all engagements with legally registered charitable organisations in the country. Fazul said the board and relevant agencies are investigating the allegations so that appropriate legal action is taken.
