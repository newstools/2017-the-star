A former Meru Governor Peter Munya's campaigner was on Tuesday fined Sh100,000 for breaking the hand of a Kiraitu Murungi supporter. Linus Mithika, 39, was sentenced to serve 13 years in jail if he failed to raise the fine. This was after being found guilty of assaulting Evans Mutethia. He was charged in a Meru court with causing a grievous harm to Mutethia's body and breaking his right hand during a scuffle on July 9. The court held that the prosecution's seven witnesses proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused committed the offence. Meru principal magistrate Stella Abuya said she was not convinced by the defendant that he was the one who was attacked on the said date. Mithika had told the court that he was accosted by Jubilee supporters while from his parents' home in Mikinduri. He was charged with disrupting Kiraitu's rally ahead of the August 8 election by throwing stones at the dais. The shoe vendor, a father of three, hails from Mikinduri in Tigania East (Munya's backyard). Kiraitu trounced Munya in the election but the latter has petitioned his win at Meru High court. Mithika was also charged with interfering with free political campaigns contrary to the Election Offences Act, 2016. He was also charged with causing grievous harm to the 28-year-old complainant.
