Muslims have been challenged to reach out and preach reconciliation to bridge ideological, faith and tribal differences blamed for fanning divisions. Visiting renowned Muslim scholar and international motivational speaker Ismael Menk, commonly known as Mufti Menk, warned Muslims against condoning or promoting corruption and injustices. “We sometimes forget that we are related in many ways as human beings, and every tribe believes that it is superior than the other, leading to divisions. Others think they are more special human beings than others and they deserve to live whereas others do not,” he said. “It’s distasteful to draw a line as per tribe forgetting we belong to one tribe of Adam, and tribes were only created in order for us to recognise each other, not to use them to fight each other and those we don’t agree with,” he added during his lecture to thousands of faithful at Kasarani Indoor Arena on Saturday, and yesterday in Mombasa. He called on the faithful to champion dispute resolution among various factions by forging, building of bridges and preaching against intolerance, saying that forgiveness was key to mending fences. “If you are corrupt and kill others, even if its one person, you are on the path of chaos and destroying humanity,” he said.  “Don’t shove things down others’ ‘throats, its human to diffe, lets sit down and discuss. Like brothers who have erred, don’t hate or become intolerant. Those who are godly are kind, lenient and promote harmony,” he added.
