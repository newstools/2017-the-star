The 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence, a global campaign from November 25 to 10 December, is taking place this year against the backdrop of an unprecedented global outcry.  Millions have rallied behind the hashtag #MeToo and other campaigns, exposing the sheer magnitude of sexual harassment and other forms of violence that women everywhere suffer, every day.  Breaking the silence is the first step to transforming the culture of gender-based violence.  At the heart of this year’s theme, 'Leave No One Behind - End Violence against Women', for the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women (November 25) and UNiTE Campaign's observance of the 16 Days of Activism to End Violence against Women, is the imperative to support those who are particularly vulnerable.  The UNiTE Campaign is calling on everyone to join the movement to end violence against women, using the colour orange to make your action visible. One in three women and girls experience violence in their lifetime - that is one too many.  It happens in every country and every society. It happens at home, in schools, on the streets, at work, on the internet and in refugee camps. It happens during war, and even in the absence of war. Too often, it is normalised and goes unpunished. No matter where violence against women happens, what form it takes, and whom it impacts, it must be stopped.  The promise of the Sustainable Development Goals - to leave no one behind - cannot be fulfilled without ending violence against women. Click here for the latest political news
