Construction of the Sh42 billion Thwake Multipurpose Dam in Ukambani will start in January 2018, the Water CS has said. Water CS Eugene Wamalwa yesterday said the dam will benefit 1.3 million people from Wote, Kibwezi and Konza City. "The legal issues surrounding construction of the dam have been resolved and the government has compensated a total of Sh3.5 billion. About 90 per cent of the payment has been paid," he said. Wamalwa said the dam will provide 134 million litres of water daily and will be the largest in East Africa. "We will also develop a sewerage system to cover Wote and Kibwezi areas. We also want to increase the area under irrigation to 100,000 acres to avert the drought situations prevalent in some parts of Eastern," he said. The CS spoke at Maji House during the signing of the Thwake Dam contact with Gezhouba Group of Company from China. He said the dam will be constructed in Kitui and will harness runoff water during the rain and then release the waters for various uses, among them water supply and irrigation. “As a way of increasing the economic viability of the dam, the waters from the reservoir will also be used for generate hydropower. There is also the unquantifiable benefit of mitigating floods in the lower reaches of the river and provide water for irrigation,” Wamalwa said. The CS said the contractor should mobilise equipment and personnel to start the project within the next 90 days. "Some 80 per cent of the labour force will be sourced from locals and the three counties – Kitui, Machakos and Makueni – will form a committee to monitor the project," Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu said.
