Consumers will continue enjoying the Sh90 two-kilo packet of maize flour up to December 31. The maize subsidy programme was to end at the end of October. Agriculture CS Willy Bett has said the extension to the subsidy follows a meeting between the Agriculture ministry and millers on Monday. “By now, we should be at the peak of purchasing maize from farmers. However, the ongoing rains have affected the buying of maize from farmers in the grain basket areas. As at yesterday, only 284,036 bags of maize had been purchased by the National Cereals and Produce Board against a target of more than 1.5 million bags,” he said. Bett said if the subsidy programme was to come to an end as at October, this would trigger an increase in the prices of maize tremendously to almost Sh4,500 per 90kg bag. He said this would have hurt consumers as the prices of food would go up. The CS said by next month, the rains will have reduced and farmers will be able to harvest and that by then, the country should have stocked enough maize at the National Strategic Grain Reserve. This will ensure stability of prices. Bett said between now and next month, when the subsidy is expected to end, a projected 1.7 million bags is needed for milling maize flour. The rest of the demand will be met by the maize being held by farmers, the CS said.  “Currently 1.1 million 90kg bags of maize are being offloaded at the Port of Mombasa from four ships. Another 700,000 bags are at the NCPB depots for millers," he said. Last month, President Uhuru Kenyatta announced that the government will set aside Sh6 billion to buy maize from farmers.
