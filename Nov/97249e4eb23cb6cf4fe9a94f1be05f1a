Kajiado East legislator Peris Tobiko’s remarks at a funeral yesterday that Tanzanian President John Magufuli needs divine intervention to learn good neighbourliness follow that leader’s harping on two recent incidents of harsh treatment of Kenyans in Tanzania. An unapologetic Magufuli said Tanzania is not a grazing ground for Kenyan cattle.  He also said he would take stern action against Kenyans who trespass in Tanzania with their cattle. Coming hard on the heels of Tanzanian officials’ auctioning of 1,305 Kenyan cows and the burning in their cartons of 3,000 Kenyan day-old chicks, President Magufuli’s remarks sounded rather harsh and unfriendly. And yet we are trying to build one East African Community that is also a single trade bloc and aspire to political federation.  We cannot build one EAC while one country always pulls the others back. The Maasai do not really know borders. One manyatta on the Kenyan side has relatives in manyattas on the Tanzanian side and vice versa. The EAC leaders should sit President Magufuli down and talk to him.
