Former Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo (pictured) left the court in stitches when he said his nickname ‘Otada’ means a likeable progressive person not the literal Luo meaning — a violent person. Midiwo, while being cross-examined by his lawyer Ezekiel Awino, said the name suggests an adorable progressive leader such as Gem colonial chief Odera Akang’o. He whipped parents for not taking their children to school. Akang’o would personally visit homesteads to ensure children went to school, hence, the region’s academic excellence during and after his reign. Midiwo last Friday said the name is also associated with a rare, beautiful bird in Uganda that is a taboo to kill. He spoke at the High Court in Siaya during his submission on a petition he has filed challenging the election of Gem MP Elisha Odhiambo.  Odhiambo’s lead counsel Willis Otieno tried to get Midiwo to admit that his nickname suggests in Luo that he is a violent person. “Honorable Midiwo, don’t you think your nickname has a different meaning in Luo, suggesting violence?” he asked.  The former National Assembly deputy minority leader said he was unaware of the ‘violence’ meaning.  Midiwo said the nickname is linked to a leading construction firm in Uganda called Otada Construction Company. He lost the ODM ticket to Odhiambo in April and lost again during the August 8 General Election.  The hearing continues.
