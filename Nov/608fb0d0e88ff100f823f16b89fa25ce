Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has begun the process for relocating hawkers from the CBD following a public outcry over their influx. The traders are set to be moved to a new market in Ngara in the “next few weeks”, sources at City Hall said.  Sonko has started talks with the hawkers representatives ahead of their planned relocation. A meeting between the governor and the hawkers has been scheduled for November 13. Sonko called Nairobi Hawkers’ Association chairman Waweru Kimani and struck a deal with them ahead of the meeting. “I have found space to settle your people in Ngara and we will get space for all of them there. So please call them for a meeting and then brief them on this development. We do not need to fight to make Nairobi a better place,” Sonko told Kimani on the phone. Kimani agreed to convene an urgent meeting with hawkers over the matter. Sonko said no hawker would be allowed in the Central Business District until shops close. Police and county askaris would keep vigil to ensure the order is followed, he said. “The operation will start today [Friday]and no one will be bailed out. I helped you hawkers when you had problems, so you should also help me work well with all Nairobians,” Sonko told Kimani.
