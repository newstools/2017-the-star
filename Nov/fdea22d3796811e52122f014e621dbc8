Garissa county will establish a security directorate that will work closely with the national government in handling cross-border conflicts. Garissa Deputy Governor Abdi Dagane said the directorate will also address inter-boundary disputes, reconciliation between warring communities and peacebuilding among neighbouring counties.  Dagane spoke at a Garissa hotel when he closed a workshop on cross-border and peacebuilding between district peace committees from Kenya, Jubaland, and Lower Juba. He said the directorate will engage elders from his county to solve issues arising from border disputes in the three regions. “We know security is not a devolved function. What we are trying to do is to complement the national government to improve security,” Dagane added. He said all efforts will be coordinated by the national government to ensure there is no conflict of interest. Garissa deputy commissioner Hiddi Galgalo said the national government will support their efforts because they aim to serve the residents. Galgalo said security is paramount if the inter-border trade is to flourish. He further said terrorism will be easily dealt with through such cooperation.  The meeting was organised by Igad and the National Peace Steering Committee.  It aimed to review cross-border conflicts at the Kenya-Somalia border. It is also meant to share lessons and experience from border regions in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Ivory Coast. The event also brought together peace representatives from Dadaab, Fafi, Hulugho and Ijara subcounties.
