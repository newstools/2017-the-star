The killing of four people in Mathare yesterday are not related to ethnic cleansing, the police have said. Nairobi police commander Japheth Koome said the killings were ordinary criminal activities. He said the matter was still under investigation. “We received reports that four people were murdered in Mathare Area 4 and we have so far strengthened the police presence in the area. We are equal to the task,” Koome said. Koome acknowledged that communities living in Mathare and Baba Dogo have been incited against each other. As a result, there was general panic in the two areas, Koome said. He warned leaders against inciting their supporters. “Those telling their supporters not to pay rent will also be dealt with accordingl, because it is causing tension between landlords and tenants,” Koome said. Koome said police also received reports of a person stabbed to death at Mukuru Kwa Reuben. It was alleged that the deceased had received contributions for a burial arrangement when he was attacked by an unknown assailant. The attacker made away with the money. “In such circumstances, residents should always inform the police so that we can provide them with adequate security,” Koome said. He also assured residents that there will be law and order today after the Supreme Court gives its verdict on the October 26 reelection of President Uhuru Kenyatta. “There are those who will be happy and others saddened by the verdict. We will ensure law and order are maintained and we are committed to ensure the safety of every citizen,” Koome said.  He said police officers will be joined by National Youth Service and Kenya Prisons officers to enforce law and order. Koome said police will not allow processions and are ready to use equal force as they receive from protesters. “We don’t derive any pleasure in it but we have a job to do,”Koome said.
