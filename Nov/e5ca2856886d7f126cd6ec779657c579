Kwale has been free of cholera for more than 10 years, the county Public Health department has said. This is attributed to the public health officers employed by the county government at the ward level and the numerous community health volunteers. "There have been cases in the neighbouring counties, but Kwale has reported none," Matuga subcounty public heath officer Emmaculate Awino said yesterday. She said the department has put in place preventative measures to educate residents the disease. "We have treated drinking water and water catchment areas and put preventive measures in place," Awino said. County Health executive Francis Gwama said there were two minor cases of cholera in Dzivwani in Lutsangani, near Mombasa county. He said the problem is suspected to have come from Mombasa as the victims had gone to Potrize, a place in the county to visit a relative when they fell sick and came back home. Gwama said the two patients are stable. “Locals should take precautions, especially those who go to Mombasa oftenly. The county health management team has taken the necessary drugs to the area and as we say, the team is on the ground,” he said. Gwama assured Kwale residents of better and quality healthcare. He said they will partner will all the players to ensure that available resources are well utilised.
