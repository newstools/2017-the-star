Boda boda operators in rural parts of Kisauni constituency are taking advantage of the poverty-stricken school girls to sexually exploit them, Kisauni MP Ali Mbogo has said. On Monday, Mbogo said the boda boda riders lure the underage girls into having sex with them by giving them free rides or as little as Sh50. This results in unwanted pregnancies, which force the girls to drop out of school. “This has been a problem generally but more so in Mwakirunge ward,” Mbogo said. He spoke at Mwakirunge Primary School, where he had gone to roll out a two-day feeding programme for KCPE candidates. Mwakirunge MCA Feddis Salame said as many as 20 girls have dropped out of school due to early pregnancies this year.
