President Uhuru Kenyatta yesterday pledged to lead the
country in healing and reconciliation
amid division after the Supreme Court on Monday upheld his victory. He urged leaders to desist from precipitating
violence, but focus on safeguarding the peace and security. Uhuru said he will unite all Kenyans irrespective of their political
affiliations. The President, through Statehouse spokesman Manoah
Esipisu, promised to protect all citizens from violence that has
recently led to loss of lives and destruction of property. “Our leaders’ actions should be guided by the
rule of law in this vibrant democracy. The President is troubled by violence and
disorder. No Kenyan should die because of their political allegiance,” Esipisu
said at Harambee House. “No one should fear they will be marginalised or penalised for their political choice." Uhuru praised Monday’s Supreme Court ruling, terming it impartial and one that affirmed
constitutionalism and the rule of law. “The President's actions are ordered by
the rule of law. That is why he submitted himself to the authority of the
Supreme Court after it nullified his August victory. The court has affirmed
the path governed by the constitutional institutions and rule of law,” Esipisu said. A six-judge bench led by Chief
Justice David Maraga, upheld Uhuru’s victory at the October 26 repeat presidential election.  Maraga,
DCJ Philomena Mwilu, and justices Jackton Ojwang, Smokin Wanjala, Njoki
Ndung'u and Isaac Lenaoloa unanimously dismissed the petitions filed by ex-Kilome MP Harun Mwau and co-petitioners Njonjo Mue and Khelef Khalifa.  Esipisu said more than 40 countries have
congratulated Uhuru. He said the Assumption of the Office of President Committee  is preparing for the swearing-in of Uhuru at Kararani Stadium in Nairobi. The ceremony will be held next Tuesday.  “While taking the oath of office, the President
will rededicate himself on the path of his prosperity constitutional road order,” Esipisu said.
