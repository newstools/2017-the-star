Candidates sitting this year’s KCPE exam will be the first lot to benefit from free secondary education under the government’s project set to kick off in January. The implementation, which will be done in phases starting with form ones, will fully benefit day scholars as the government will fully cater for their tuition fees by increasing the capitation per student from the current Sh12,870 to Sh22,241. Despite the doubled capitation, students proceeding to boarding secondary schools will be required to pay at least Sh44,000 to meet other expenses, slashed from Sh53,554. In a bid to fulfill its campaign pledges, the government in September allocated Sh25 billion for free day secondary education to be rolled out from January next year. Out of this, Sh6 billion was to improve 2,500 schools and expand infrastructure to enable institutions to accommodate more students targeting to meet the 100 per cent transition.  Part of the funds were also allocated to the Teachers Service Commission and will be used to employ 10,000 new teachers to address the teacher shortage. Yesterday, Education CS Fred Matiang’i affirmed the government’s commitment to ensure those admitted to secondary schools benefit from free basic education. “In 2018, the form one intake will cater for 1,003,552 learners sitting their KCPE this year,” he said.
