Former Kenyan ambassador to Tanzania Ali Chirau Mwakwere has suffered a major blow after the High Court threw out his petition against Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya. Justice Mugure Thande said the petition was defective and incurable and cannot hold ground. The petition which was filed by a voter, Mbwana Mwamlole was seeking nullification of the election of Mvurya. Mwamlole further wanted the High Court to order for fresh polls. Chirau popularly known as Zipapa will now pay Sh 2.5 million as the cost to the petition. Mwakwere contested for the seat on a Wiper ticket.
