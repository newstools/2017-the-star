Businessman Benson Thuranira has backed up his claims that singer Bahati, who is his neighbour, conned him of over Sh200,000, which he says the singer used to foot his wedding bills. Based on M-Pesa and bank records in our possession, Bahati was given over Sh300,000 by Benson. Benson told Word Is that he has also bailed the singer out on his high electricity and pay-TV monthly bills. "He told me he is in a tight spot nimpatie pesa, alikua amesota hana kakitu. Nimekua nikimlipia mpaka DStv yake. Kuna time stima yake ilikua imekatwa, nikamlipia. Analipangwa, sijui pesa yake anapelekanga wapi, but that guy is broke, hana chochote kabisa." Benson said he and Bahati were to start a company called EMB Films and Production, but the singer diverted the funds. "Alinicon pesa ndio akaenda akafanya harusi, ananidanganya ni biashara na hakuna biashara hapo. I came to realise alikua anataka pesa akafanye harusi. He wanted five million and when he got the Sh200,000 akaanza kufanya mipango ya kufanya harusi." He added,"Bahati hataki kurudisha pesa. I can say Bahati is a wise conman, mostly, akicon watu hataki kutumia number zake." He adds that if he doesn't get redress from the law, then he will seek justice through "kienyeji" means. "Ile kitu ningependa kuambia Bahati ni arudishe pesa zangu na kama hayuko willing kurudisha, kuna jia mingi sana za kurecover hiyo pesa kama sheria, na incase sheria imwondolee mashtaka, nitatumia njia za kienyeji nitarudi nyumbani, niongee na wazee wafanye maneno zao." Called for comment, Bahati said he has not been taken to court. He said Benson's lawyers called him asking for a meeting. He said he has "no time" and thus directed him to his lawyers. Meanwhile, Bahati's wife, Diana Marua, has committed social media suicide. It is not clear why she has exited the interwebs.
