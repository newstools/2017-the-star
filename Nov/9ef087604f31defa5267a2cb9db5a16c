Former Nyeri woman representative Priscilla Nyokabi has asked Governor Mutahi Kahiga for a job. "Give me a job. I am now jobless but very ready to serve if given an opportunity," she said. Nyokabi spoke during former Governor Wahome Gakuru's memorial service at the Dedan Kimathi University of Technology on Tuesday. This was after Kahiga invited her to speak. The Governor had just finished his speech when he noticed Nyokabi at the auditorium and gave her a chance to address the gathering.  Kahiga introduced Nyokabi as a prominent lawyer. The ex-county MP did not specify the job she is interested in. The top vacant post in the county at the moment is that of deputy governor but the constitution does not say how the position should be filled. Deputy Governor Mutahi Kahiga was sworn-in as Wahome Gakuru's successor as he died. This was in line with the law that a deputy governor assumes office in the event a county boss dies or becomes incapacitated.
