The government has announced measures meant to increase maize production countrywide. They include reducing production costs. With the country already facing a 10-million-bag deficit, the government says it will lease its land to maize growers.  This emerged on Friday at the Country Club, Naivasha, at the end of a three-day forum between the state and players in the grain sector. Agriculture CS Willy Bett said the government is keen to reduce pressure on maize — Kenya’s staple food.  He said production stands at 40 million bags per year against the demand for 50 million bags.  “We had a productive meeting with stakeholders in the maize sector and we have agreed on a raft of issues, which will come in handy in addressing productivity,” Bett said.  The government will introduce a new policy to make it a requirement for millers to blend maize with millet, sorghum or cassava.  “Through this initiative, we shall reduce the issue of malnutrition by two per cent annually and also give millet, sorghum or cassava farmers a chance to sell their produce,” Bett said.  The government is also keen to introduce mechanised farming.  A Sh10 billion security facility had been introduced for farmers, Bett said, adding they will phase out all maize varieties that are 10 years old and promote better seeds.
