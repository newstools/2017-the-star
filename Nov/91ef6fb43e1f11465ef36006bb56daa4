A mobile phone robbed from a KDF officer led police to arrest two men found with a pistol stolen from the driver of DCJ Philomena Mwilu. Flying Squad officers from Karuri police station have been following up the murder of KDF officer Francis Wanyonyi since August.  His mobile phone was stolen during the attack in Kahawa Wendani. On Thursday night, police recovered Glock and Ceska pistols from a house in Dandora. Three suspects were arrested. They have been identified as James Wachira Kibe, Eric Njuguna Kamau and John Mwaura. They are aged 26, 28 and 21 respectively. Nairobi head of criminal investigations Ireri Kamwende confirmed that the serial number of the gun matched the one issued to Titus Musyoka. Musyoka is the driver of Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu. He was attacked and shot on October 25. His gun was stolen.  He had just dropped Mwilu at her Karen home when the incident occurred on Ngong Road. Musyoka was leaving a nursery shed, where he had gone to buy seedlings, when he was shot. He was admitted to the Nairobi Women’s Hospital with a single bullet wound and has since been discharged. The incident, coming weeks after the Supreme Court nullified President Uhuru Kenyatta’s August 8 election victory, received widespread speculation. Politicians and some social media commentators claimed the shooting was intended to intimidate judicial officers. The DCJ is a judge of the Supreme Court. Police however said it was a normal robbery incident. Police said a pistol holster belonging to Musyoka was recovered from Njuguna’s house in Kasarani estate.  Police will conduct an identification parade next week to have Musyoka pick his attacker.
