The CID and senior Agriculture ministry officials are investigating claims that subsidised fertiliser meant for farmers has been diverted to middlemen. Agriculture CS Willy Bett yesterday told the Star that the government has suspended the sale of the fertiliser until the probe is complete. The ministry is aware of claims that fertiliser at the National Cereals and Produce Board in Rift Valley depots have been diverted to middlemen who will later sell to farmers at exorbitant prices.  “We suspended the sale of fertiliser for some time because we suspect some people who are not farmers are buying fertiliser in huge quantities,” Bett said. Only registered farmers are entitled to subsidised fertiliser.
