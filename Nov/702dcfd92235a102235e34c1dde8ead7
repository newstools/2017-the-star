Election losers from Western have asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to appoint them to plum government positions to reward them for supporting him. Several politicians from the region lost in the August 8 election while others joined Uhuru’s campaign team after the Supreme Court nullified his victory. On Monday, Uhuru was declared winner. He will not be sworn in until election petitions are settled. Speaking to the Star on Tuesday, former Bumula MP Boniface Otsiula said Uhuru should appoint them to the Cabinet. He said politicians understand best what affects the electorate. “The President should reward politicians who walked the campaign trail with him because it is the only way to accommodate those swept away by party waves,” Otsiula said. Other politicians already lobbying for appointments include former Kanduyi MP Alfred Khang’ati, former Bungoma Woman representative Reginalda Wanyonyi, KRA director Evans Kakai and Murumba Chikati who unsuccessfully vied for the Tongaren parliamentary seat. Khang’ati contested the Bungoma governorship on the ODM ticket and lost. He came third after former Governor Ken Lusaka and Governor Wyckliffe Wangamati. He later decamped to Jubilee to support Uhuru. It is said he is lobbying for a position in the Cabinet. Otsiula has asked Uhuru to create the positions of assistant minister to ensure there are more jobs to accommodate more politicians. His proposal was backed by former Lugari MP Cyrus Jirongo. Wanyonyi is keen on an ambassadorial position, sources close to her told the Star. Kakai, a close ally of Deputy President William Ruto, is angling to become a Principal Secretary. He was among the main Jubilee financiers in Bungoma.
