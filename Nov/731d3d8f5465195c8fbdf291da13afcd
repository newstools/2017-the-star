Konza Technopolis Development Authority CEO John Tanui has praised Kenya for taking up technology. “Kenya has in many ways defied the odds in the adoption and application of technology. Whilst the most outstanding innovation out of Kenya has been the adoption of mobile money transfer, other sectors of our economy have equally kept abreast with technology,” he said.  Tanui spoke during the official opening of the three-day Third Science, Technology, Innovation and Entrepreneurship Conference at Dedan Kimathi University of Technology, Nyeri, on Friday. He said Kenya is one of the fastest-growing technology hubs in Africa. Tanui said the country’s growing reputation for innovation has attracted billions in Foreign Direct Investment, according to a report by Venture Capital for Africa.
