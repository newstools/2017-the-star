Children’s correctional facilities need to be equipped with modern facilities, Correctional Services PS Richard Ekai said yesterday. He said the institutions need modern facilities like tablets for the children to compete favourably with other children in normal schools. “We will speak with the Education ministry so they can bring tablets here for the digital literacy programme,” Ekai said. The PS said the rate of successful reintegration into society at the three borstal institutions in the country is encouraging. The three institutions are Shikusa Boys Detention Centre in Kakamega, Shimo la Tewa Borstal Institution in Mombasa and Kamae Girls Borstal Institution in Kiambu. Speaking at Shimo la Tewa Borstal Institution after a tour of the facility and donating some mattresses, blankets, sweaters and material, Ekai said the government is planning to modernise the learning facilities in the institutions.
