The Examinations Council has assured the public that no Kenya Certificate of Primary Education examination papers have been leaked. In a statement on Saturday, KNEC chairman George Magoha said the council has received reports of people purporting to be selling ‘genuine’ KCPE examination papers that candidates are scheduled to sit beginning Tuesday. “These papers have been sent to the council which has scrutinized them and found that all of them are fake. The papers being sold do not have the slightest likeness to what we have set and printed,” said Magoha.

This criminal act can only succeed to cause panic among candidates,” Magoha said. The reports come just days after KNEC announced new examination guidelines it said were aimed at sealing all loopholes for cheating in this year’s national examinations.
