National Under 19 cricket team coach Jimmy Kamande has praised the development and confidence of the young players coming through the ranks after a successful one-week tour of Rwanda. The junior boys won three of their five matches and Kamande took some positives, singling out the performances put by Aveet Desai and Aman Gandhi. Kenya was using the matches to prepare for next year’s ICC U19 World Cup in New Zealand. “The youngsters played really well and showed a lot of promise towards the end,” said Kamande. “It’s great to see them play with confidence and with a bit of freedom. I think it tells a story about our culture within the team. The guys have the freedom to watch the ball and enjoy the cricket,” the coach said. The coach said he is impressed with the character shown by the players and emphasizes that the chances of Kenya against the likes of defending champions West Indies and former champions South Africa are now higher than before. “There has been a lot of positives since everything has worked out. We are able to see players batting for longer. We are able to see the players thinking on bowling and field changes on their own, which clearly shows that they are improving,” Kamande said. Being Kenya’s first appearance at the World Cup in 14 years, Kamande was upbeat that, with the confidence acquired in the tour, the team will be in good shape at the start of the global tournament. “They really backed themselves up and feel confident and free to do whatever they want and express their talents. I was pretty impressed. I think the depth looks really good and the future looks bright.”
