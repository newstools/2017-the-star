There has been a 10 per cent drop in road fatalities in the past one year, NTSA director general Francis Meja said yesterday. He said all categories of accidents have significantly dropped compared to the same period last year. “Overall, we have recorded a 18 per cent drop in all categories of accidents reported across the country,” Meja said. He spoke after leading a road safety campaign in Kyumvi Junction on the Nairobi-Mombasa highway. Meja warned that drivers who continuously commit traffic offences risk having their licences permanently withdrawn.  “With the smart driving licences which will soon be rolled out, we will easily profile drivers who continuously commit traffic offences,” he said.
