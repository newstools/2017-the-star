Kilifi activist-cum-politician Nicholas Wanyepe has been arrested. The vocal Kilifi South leader was arrested on Saturday in Mtwapa before being transferred to Kilifi police station for allegedly possessing materials that may incite the public against the government. Wanyepe unsuccessfully ran for the Kilifi South MP seat on August 8. He vied as an independent candidate after losing the ODM nomination to incumbent MP Ken Chonga. County police boss Ben Kogo yesterday confirmed the arrest and said Wanyepe will be arraigned in court today. Speaking to the Star on the phone, Kogo said Wanyepe had materials that would likely incite the government, but did not give details. Branch NASA coordinator Leah Akech said the arrest is a ploy by the state to intimidate the opposition. Â
