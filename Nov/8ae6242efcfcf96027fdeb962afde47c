A 25-year old man Baringo North killed himself on Tuesday by taking poison after his brother allegedly sold his eight goats, his source of livelihood, without his consent. Kipkemei Tobero died on arrival at Baringo County Referral Hospital in Kabarnet town. Kipkata location chief Isaac Tobole said Tobero had reported his missing goats to Rondinin sublocation assistant chief Reuben Chelimo. He accused his elder brother Kimuge Tobero, 32, of the theft on Monday last week, but the case was yet to be handled, Tobole said. He said Kipkemei had argued with Kimuge over the eight missing goats and kids before taking his own life. “It must have been so painful for him to lose his entire source of livelihood. That’s why he might have chosen to take his own life,” Tobole said. The goats were auctioned in Rondinin village without his knowledge. “The two had quarrelled and and fought over the goats before the younger brother decided to take poison” neighbour Raphael Cherutoi said. He said they heard screams around 11am and rushed to help. “He had already taken the poison, lying flat on the ground and helpless with a bottle of poison. Then we rushed him to the hospital where he died upon arrival,” he said. Resident Wilson Sumukwo said while they helped Kipkemei on a boda boda, his brother seemed indifferent. Their aged father, former public servant and village elder Tobero Rutto, has suffered a stroke and was unable to comment yesterday. Chief Tobole called Kipkemei a humble and hardworking young man. He warned residents against taking the law into their own hands and said livestock disputes among Baringo’s pastoral communities were increasing. Kimuge, a trader at Kipsaraman Centre, dismissed reports about the matter. “Why call me over such nonsense?” he asked reporters. He said his brother took poison and died.
