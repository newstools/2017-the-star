A man is admitted to the Homa Bay referral hospital in critical condition after he was attacked by a crocodile in Kabuoch, Ndhiwa Sub County. George Onyango, 30, was attacked in River Kuja when he was heading to his home in Bungu village. Eyewitnesses said the crocodile grabbed the victim as he crossed the river on Wednesday evening. “The reptile captured and threw him on the other side of the river bank where he suffered injuries on both legs,” a witness said.

His brother, Erick Otieno called the Kenya Wildlife Service to relocate the crocodile. Otieno said the number of reptiles in the river had increased. “Recently a woman and her child suffered similar injuries after two crocodiles mauled them in the river when they went to fetch water,” Otieno said. He urged Homa Bay government to construct for them a bridge across the river. Otieno said that lack of bridge has hampered communication in the area. “Traders cannot reach Kachieng market centre, especially during rainy season, for fear of being attacked by the reptiles,” he added. Area assistant chief Joash Osuju confirmed the incident. “We took him to the hospital after I received reports that the man had injuries,” Osuju said.
