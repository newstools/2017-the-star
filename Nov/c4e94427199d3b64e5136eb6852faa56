Calm has returned to Moyale, Marsabit county, following an attack on Tuesday that left one person with serious injuries. A motorcycle rider from neighbouring Mandera was attacked by unknown people, sparking fears of retaliatory attacks in the Northern Kenya region. Marsabit county commissioner Michael Mwangi said the victim is a resident of Elwak, Mandera county. Mwangi on Friday said the victim is recuperating at a hospital in Moyale as police investigate. He said calm has been restored at the border area following rising tension after the attack. “The area is peaceful. We are trying our best to eliminate criminals,” he said. Security officers moved with speed to stop retaliatory attacks and maintain peace, Mwangi added. The administrator said the motive of the attack has not been established since the attackers did not steal anything from the victim. Moyale MCA Kiya Chana said elders from the border area will meet to prevent retaliatory attacks and broker peace among warring communities. Chana said tension was still high in Moyale’s Biashara Street on Saturday. He called for a multi-agency approach to combat insecurity. Unconfirmed reports indicate violence broke out in the town on Thursday, leaving seven people wounded. Resident Hassu Abdullahi said two warring communities – the Garre and Borana — clashed for two hours from 10am to noon, further worsening the situation.
