Former Nacada chairman John Mututho has said drugs and alcohol have been introduced in the ongoing initiation ceremonies for boys during the December holidays. Terming the issue serious, Mututho said hundreds of youths had been affected. He pointed to Central and parts of Western Kenya as the most affected, adding  the issue needs to be addressed urgently. Addressing the press in Naivasha on Saturday, Mututho identified bhang, tobacco and cigarettes as some the substances boys were being introduced to as part of the initiation. “I am deeply concerned by the ongoing cases,” he said. The former Naivasha MP called on parents and the Church to come out publicly and condemn drug abuse before it spreads further.
