Budalang'i MP Raphael Wanjala on Wednesday reminded Ababu Namwamba that he is the current boss at the constituency. Wanjala, in a Facebook post, referred to the former legislator as 'a Budalangi resident.' The two leaders have had their share of political battles at the constituency since the Wanjala lost the seat in 2007.

This was after the signing of the Sh10 billion Lower Nzoia irrigation project at Maji House, Nairobi. "The function was hosted by Water and Irrigation CS Eugene Wamalwa. With us is a Budalangi resident Ababu Namwamba," Wanjala said. The MP represented the constituency from 2002-2007 before he was ousted by Namwamba who enjoyed the support of the ODM party. In 2007, Ababu took over for two terms after Wanjala joined PNU and led the constituency up to August this year. Wanjala secured the ODM ticket and won the last general election. Namwamba is currently working with the Jubilee Party and has been a fierce critic of NASA leader Raila Odinga following the disputed October 26 repeat election. He is a member of the Council of Kenya Professionals which is pushing an anti-NASA agenda in the country. The group recently crafted a petition to the Treasury to cut off the national share of funding sent to the seven counties in Luo Nyanza and Western.  They are Siaya, Homa Bay, Vihiga, Busia, Kisumu, Migori, and Kakamega, which are NASA's strongholds.
