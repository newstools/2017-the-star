President Uhuru Kenyatta has mourned professor Okoth Okombo as one of Kenya's most distinguished scholars. Uhuru said Okombo, who died at a Nairobi hospital on Wednesday night, earned the respect of his peers at home and abroad. "In linguistics and communication studies, he cut a niche for himself as a true patriot who ensured the growth of nationhood through his profession," he said. "I am deeply saddened by his death." The President praised the professor for his contributions to the development of sign language, which he noted helped ensure equity among Kenyans. Okombo leaves behind a large body of work which Uhuru said will not be forgotten. "It will remain a point of reference for scholars and practitioners both now and in times to come." He told his relatives that his thoughts and prayers are with them. The President also condoled with former minister Gilbert M'Mbijiwe's family who served as agriculture in former president Daniel Moi's government. Uhuru said M'Mbijiwe was an astute politician who placed his long experience of politics and public service at the disposal of Kenyans. He said he also contributed greatly to the growth of agriculture in Kenya and served with dedication and zeal. He prayed for grace for the bereaved.
