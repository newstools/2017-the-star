The IEBC has revealed statistics from its technology provider OT-Morpho to debunk claims the commission inflated the turnout of the October 26 presidential vote. Statistics from the French firm indicate 7,575,806 voters nationally were identified through the KIEMS kits. While announcing the presidential results on Monday, IEBC boss Wafula Chebukati said 7,616,217 people voted, a 38.8 per cent turnout. But the turnout has stirred controversy, with opposition chief Raila Odinga claiming the IEBC cooked turnout statistics to give a false impression President Uhuru Kenyatta has a popular mandate. According to Raila, only 3.5 million people voted in the election. “The IEBC was not able to produce a believable voter turnout figure, even though the KIEMS kits are programmed to transmit the same every two hours,” Raila protested on Tuesday. However, OT-Morpho’s data shows 5,525,487 voters were identified using biometric finger identification, 1,622,276 through alpha-numeric search and 428,043 using the documents search in the register. This means that only 40,411 voters were identified from the manual register. The OT-Morpho details have statics from all poling stations where voting took place. “I am pleased to provide you with a report attached to this letter detailing the numbers of identified voters per polling station, with the details of the means used for these identifications,”OT-Morpho wrote in a letter dated October 30. This was the same day Uhuru was declared winner of the controversial contest and handed his certificate. But the French company said the details requested by Chebukati will help him respond to Ekuro Aukot’s Thirdway Alliance. “I do believe that this report will allow IEBC to respond to the request of the Thirdway Alliance Kenya, but also to further requests that you could receive from political parties or observers,”the firm said.  OT-Morpho’s credibility came under sharp scrutiny after the August poll amid allegations that its systems were hacked.
