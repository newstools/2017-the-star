Nine grocers were charged with being in possession of plastic bags at the Machakos law court on Friday. They are Erick Munyoki, Rhoda Mutisya, Daniel Mutiso, Mary Nzilani, Christine Ndunge, Mwanzia Mwikali, Jedidah Muthoka, Bunekha Munyesia, and Joyce Mwikali. The lot appeared before senior resident magistrate Kipkurui Kibelion. They were separately arrested at Marikiti market in Machakos town and at Kaseve market along Machakos - Kitui Road on November 8. They were charged with contravening Section 140 (b) of the Environmental Management and Coordination Act, Cap 387 Laws of Kenya. The said law bans the use of plastic flat and carrier bags as prescribed under gazette notice number 2334 and 2356. "....you unlawfully packaged tomatoes using flat plastic bags, same having been banned under the said gazette notice," their charge sheets read in part. The grocers pleaded guilty to the offence and will serve a three-month community service under Community Service Committal Order. The court directed the area probation officer to ensure the traders serve the sentence. Kibelion warned that the court will not sympathise with any other offender who will be brought before it over the same offence. He said those found guilty in future will be exposed to fine of between Sh2 to Sh4 million or serve jail terms of between 18-24 months.
