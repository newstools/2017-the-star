Former Kimilili MP Suleiman Muranga has accused IEBC of "participating greatly" in his loss on August 8 by interfering with the voting process. Murunga, a Ford Kenya member, was floored in the election by Jubilees Party's first-timer Didimus Baraza, a former KDF officer. He accused electoral agency officers of colluding with his opponent to deny him victory by intimidating his agents at all the 640 polling stations across the constituency. The politician testified at the High Court in Bungoma on Monday in his case for Baraza's win to be nullified. Murunga claimed the election was marred by many irregularities and illegalities that he said were mainly caused by IEBC. He told judge Antony Murima that Baraza was not duly elected. "Your honour, there were a lot of cases of voter bribery but I could not report them to IEBC because they had taken sides." The former MP also told the court he could not report the cases to police as they watched as malpractices took place. "I could not report the matter at Kimilili police station because the voter bribery was executed before police who were supposed to arrest the culprits." Murunga said he failed to report 'voter buying' because both police and IEBC were against him. He also said the agency's officials chased voters out of most centres, claiming they had already voted, and that some were turned away after their IDs were declared fake. "Your honour, only experts from the registrar of persons can detect whether an ID is fake, not IEBC officers." Meanwhile, the case by Peter Sitati (Ford Kenya) against Webuye West MP Dan Wanyama (Jubilee) failed to kick as the returning officer who was to testify arrived late. He apologised saying he was held up but judge Abida Aroni fined his counsel Sh10,000 and pushed the case to Tuesday.
