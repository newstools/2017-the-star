City residents will continue to put up with hawkers in the city centre after the street vendors vowed to stay put, despite the county’s plans to relocate them. Last week, Governor Mike Sonko started talks with the hawkers’ representatives to relocate them to Ngara, following a public outcry over the uncontrolled influx of vendors downtown. They have occupied pavements and streets, blocking shops and roads and causing congestion and disorder in the country’s capital. But yesterday, the hawkers’ association chairman Kimani Waweru disowned the ‘representatives’ the city boss talked to, to have the traders leave the CBD. Kimani said the governor talked to non-members, adding that the street vendors will continue operating in the CBD until he [Sonko], engages the association directly. “The people the governor has been talking to are not from the association. We are not refusing to move out but we can only do so if we are engaged and given an alternative area to operate from,” Waweru said. He said the people Sonko talked to cannot hold brief or talk on behalf of the association as they are not recognised by the members. “We don’t have any war with the governor but we are saying he should engage us directly, not through brokers,” Waweru said. A spot check downtown on Monday and yesterday showed that order is slowly returning to some streets that had been turned into open-air markets.  County inspectorate officers were seen patrolling the streets and ensuring the hawkers were not operating in the CBD. In the evening hours, the traders engaged the county askaris in running battles. They had occupied pavements on Moi Avenue, Tom Mboya, Ronald Ngala, Luthuli Avenue, River Road — and were moving uptown.
