So, here we are, poised to begin round six of Brexit talks, and it might move you to raise an eyebrow or two to hear that the two sides can't even agree what to call these meetings now: negotiating rounds, stock-taking exercises or an information exchange. These days I'd call them a dance around a standstill. UK negotiators have long been frustrated with the format of the (so far) monthly rounds of talks. They feel that sitting in Brussels for days at a stretch doesn't allow them the opportunity to consult London when an impasse is reached in order to - maybe - come up with a plan B and - hopefully - move forward. But EU negotiators ruled out more a more flexible style of talks because, instead of consulting with one capital city, they've got 27 of them that would want to chip in, plus the European Parliament. Simply not practicable, they say. Perhaps then you won't fall off your chair in shock when I tell you expectations of round six of -whatever these talks should be labelled as - are low on the Brussels side of the Channel. Yet that's not met here with a sea of EU shoulder shrugs. Quite the opposite. People I speak to are agitated. EU sources close to the negotiations have told me they believe the UK has only two weeks left to make progress on the Brexit divorce issues. Otherwise, I've been told, EU leaders are extremely unlikely to vote at their December summit to widen talks to include trade and transition deals - as the UK so dearly wants Some EU countries, such as Poland and Sweden, are keen to move on to talks of a future relationship with the UK - while others, like Germany and France, are more cautious. But there is unanimity amongst all 27 that the UK must pay. Brussels insists it doesn't need a precise figure right now. It does, however, want far more detail than what is perceived here as the vague promise Theresa May made in late September in her Florence speech that the UK is a country which honours its commitments.
