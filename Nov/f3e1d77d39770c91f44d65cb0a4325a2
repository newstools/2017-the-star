Gatundu North MP Annie Kibe has said Jubilee will use its tyranny of numbers to defeat the Secession Bill. The Bill drafted by Homa Bay Town MP Peter Kaluma seeks to have 40 of the 47 counties break away to form the People’s Republic of Kenya.  Speaking in her constituency on Monday, Kibe accused NASA of trying to turn 43 tribes against one. She said this cannot be allowed to happen as Kenya is one country with one government and one President. “Let them to bring the Bill, which is dead at inception, to Parliament and they will see the tyranny of numbers at work,” Kibe said.  She criticised NASA for trying to make the country ungovernable and sabotaging the economy. Kibe urged the opposition leaders to accept defeat and allow the country to move on.
