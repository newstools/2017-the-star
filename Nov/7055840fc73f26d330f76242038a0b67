Starring: David Boreanaz, Max Thieriot, Jessica Paré, Neil Brown Jr, AJ Buckley, Toni Truck Genre: Drama/Action Release date: September 27    Chief Petty Officer Jason Hayes is the leader of an elite Navy SEAL team that takes on dangerous missions at short notice. During one of their more recent missions, Jason’s closest friend and team member is killed in a surprise attack on the team. Jason blames himself for his friend’s death and is ordered to attend psychotherapy sessions to which (surprise surprise) he doesn’t open up about his feelings. Hayes also recently separated from his wife and is estranged from his children. To avoid thinking about his loss, Jason focuses on his work. On their next mission, the team is sent to capture Isil leader Abu Samir in Liberia. But before they leave, the Navy decides to add a young trainee to Jason’s team. The rookie, Clay Spencer, is young and eager to do well; but his eagerness makes the team question whether he is ready for their kind of work. While on mission they discover that the Liberian militants are holding on to an American female doctor as prisoner. They attempt to bring in both the prisoner and the Isil leader alive but things turn out differently when the panicked rookie, Clay, shoots and kills Abu Samir. Coming after the premier of other SEAL-themed shows such as Six, this SEAL Team just about manages to capture our attention. Especially because of David Boreanaz performance. He manages to take charge of the scenes and draw us in to his own darkened world. The show itself is clean-cut, the plot is straightforward and the action is not overly complicated. It offers nothing new, but the writers just about manage to capture our attention with their subtly suggestive political inferences. Star Rating:
