Justice Chepkwony said in the first case against Katana, two petitions bearing the same date had been attached to it. She said there was evidence that the petitioner swapped the second petition with the first petition. "The petitioner could only amend the petition with the leave of the court as required by law which was never sought,' she said. In the second one, Justice Chepkwony said the petition was incompetent and had anomalies that are deeply-rooted. Kaingu a resident of Kilifi South and a supporter of former MP Mustafa Idd of Jubilee Party had accused the IEBC and Returning Officer Neema Karisa of presiding illegalities. These are not the only petitions which have been struck off by the Malindi high court.
