Trans Nzoia Senator Michaal Mbito has urged Kenyans to get back to work to develop the country. He said on Monday this will ensure MPs perform their duties so funds are made available for the counties.  Mbito spoke when he inspected the construction of a Sh8 million borehole project in Sinoko, Cherangany constituency. “We are tired of politicking. We want to concentrate on developing the country,” he said. The 60-metre deep borehole is funded by Water Missions Kenya to serve 2,000 residents. It will provid clean piped water and end water shortages.  Country director of Water Missions Kenya Moses Ng’ania said the project will provide safe water meeting the World Health Organization Standards.
