City Hall yesterday announced automation of 44 more revenue streams, bringing the total to 58 out of 136. More will be automated as soon as possible as the cash-poor city faces a financial crisis. Web Tribe, the company contracted to automate collections, said it has automated 44 streams in addition to the 14 previously put online. Corrupt county officers, failure to automateall 136 streams and leaks associated with manual systems have been blamed for low collections. In the last financial year ending June 30, City Hall had a deficit of Sh11 billion due low collections. It managed to collect only 7.5 per or Sh1.4 billion in the first quarter of the 2017-18 financial year. Chief executive Danson Muchemi said payments for documents and services could now be made via eJijiPay’s online platform. “What is left is for the county government to put up a bill number where residents can make payments and get receipts. These will be used as proof of payment for services,” Muchemi said. Education, inoculation and garbage collection fees are among the latest revenue streams that have been automated. Residents have been queuing at Huduma Centres and community centres to apply and pay for birth and death documents . Residents now will be required to make payments online at standard fees of Sh50 to Sh150. They will be contacted and told when to collect them. Other streams automated are food handlers’ certificates, tax inspections, court fines, court awards, adverts on poles, building materials, licenses, exchequer releases and hoarding fees. Others are survey fees, Waithaka Technical centre, laboratory fees, Dagoreti training fees, building occupation certificates, conveyance fees and ambulance fees.
