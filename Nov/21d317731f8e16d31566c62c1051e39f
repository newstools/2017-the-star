Ardhi House staff have accused Lands CS Jacob Kaimenyi and PS Nicholas Muraguri of failing to ensure that minisstry officials don’t work at one stations for more than five years. The workers yesterday told the Star the directive against over-staying was issued by the government in 2015. They said the limits are meant to curb corruption and end impunity, especially at the Lands Ministry. Ardhi House has made headlines over allegations of corruption scandals and cartels colluding with officials to frustrate issuance of title deeds and help in landgrabbing. Efforts to reach Kaimenyi and his PS were unsuccessful. “We wonder whether the CS and his PS are being held to ransom by some of these officers. They’re untouchable and refuse to leave. Some have stayed at this station for more than 30 years,” one junior staff said. Another employee said, “We ask the senior-most authorities, led by Kaimenyi, to enforce the directive.” Those supposed to have been transferred are mainly in the departments of registration and stamp duty. They are blamed for poor services.
