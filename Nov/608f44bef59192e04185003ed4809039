  An elderly couple is feared dead in Marsabit following heavy rains that have caused flooding many parts of the county. Jillo Korme and his wife Shake were in their hut when they were swept by raging floods in North Horr on Monday. Area deputy county commissioner Victor Omondi said Balesa Bura and Arillo rivers burst their banks. Transport has been paralysed. He said 31 divers are searching for the bodies. “There are plans to supply relief food by air because roads are impassable,” Omondi said. Authorities said some areas started experiencing floods last week, but the flooding worsened from the weekend. Maikona MCA Buke Diba said Olom is worst affected by the heavy rains that began late last month. Diba said an unknown number of livestock have been swept away floods. “Residents are fleeing from their huts to spend the night in the cold on higher ground. An unknown number of livestock has been swept away,” Diba said. Humanitarian organisations said at least 280 families had been affected in Saku by Thursday and that the number could have increased after the rains in North Horr.  Area county commissioner Meru Mwangi asked locals to move to higher ground . He said the heavy rains and floods have hampered the search for the missing couple.
