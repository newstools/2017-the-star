Tecno Mobile has launched ‘Child Adopts a Tree’ programme in children’s homes and schools in Ukambani. The company’s project manager Kilonzo Mumo said the initiative is intended to promote environmental conservation, alongside instilling virtue of responsibility among the children at their tender ages. Mumo addressed the press at Liberty Children Home in Mavoko, Machakos County on Saturday. He said Tecno donated over 1,000 tree seedlings and helped orphans and vulnerable children in the institution plant them within the institution’s compound under “child adopts a tree” program.
