Gospel singer Bahati was accused of owing someone Sh200,000. Bahati allegedly obtained the money through false pretences about two months ago and was reported at Karuri police station in Kiambu county. The accuser said Bahati was arrested at his home, but the investigating officer received a call from his boss to release Bahati with immediate effect, citing an order from the county commander. Well, Bahati has come out to strongly shut down the allegations. Speaking to Word Is, Bahati said he has never been arrested in his life and the guy must pay for the accusations. "The minute I saw what this guy was saying, I engaged the lawyers of my company, EMB records. When he saw that it is now a matter concerning the law, he deleted the post he had initially put up stating that I owe him money, because he has been sued for defamation. I have built my name for years and if I don't do something so that it's a lesson to someone else, tomorrow, someone will wake up and say I've stolen his car. Stealing from someone is something very sensitive or conning someone," Bahati said. He went on to state, "So the police have been told to investigate the matter, and if he doesn't prove his allegations, it will be a court case. But he's been looking for me and the management asking for forgiveness. I have never been arrested in my life, even when I was in the ghetto, and that is spoiling my name because you don't even have my mugshot. But one thing I'm sure about is that I must be paid for this accusations."
