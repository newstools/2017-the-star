UNHCR assistant protection officer Wanna Munaita on Wednesday said under the partnership, they have done birth registration for more than 11,000 children since 2015. Munaita said, their main aim is to prevent future statelessness in the county. "Its important for a child to have a birth certificate, since it's the only protection tool for the minor," she said.  Munaita said there are more than 4,000 stateless Wapemba in the country. She said citizenship is a right that everyone should enjoy. "We will work to ensure all those who qualify to be granted citizenship are given the opportunity so that they can enjoy the rights and freedom as other citizens," Munaita said. "With combined efforts from human rights organisations and the government, statelessness will be a thing of the past."  Haki Centre executive director Felix Lore said they are advocating for the issuance of citizenship to stateless communities who meet the requirements. However, he asked the government to come up with a simplified process that will help stateless people apply for citizenship. Pemba community chairperson Shame Makame said they have lived in fear and harassment as stateless community. He said the situation has also created barrier to education and adequate health services. "I'm frustrated as my hopes to join college are shuttered due to lack of identity card," Hamisi Amuri, a former student of Shimoni Secondary School, said. Amuri scored a mean grade of C- in 2015.  He wants to be a teacher but lack of a birth certificate and ID.
