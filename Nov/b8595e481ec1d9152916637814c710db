A
total of 993,718 candidates sat the 2017 KCPE examination. Of these, 498,775
(50.19%) were boys and 494,943 (49.81%) girls. In the 2016 KCPE, 942,021
candidates sat the examination. The
percentage increase in the number of female candidates (5.64%) was higher than
that of male candidates (5.34%) in the 2017 KCPE examination. An analysis of
candidature trends by gender in the last four years indicates that the
percentage increase in the number of girls has consistently been higher than
that of boys. I
wish to note with satisfaction that 27 counties registered more female than
male candidates as opposed to 23 in the 2016 KCPE. These counties, which I must
praise, are: Kakamega, Meru, Bungoma, Nairobi, Embu, Machakos, Vihiga, Kisii,
Kitui, Makueni, Siaya, Busia, Nyamira, Tharaka Nithi, Trans Nzoia, Kisumu,
Nakuru, Murang’a, Mombasa, Elgeyo Marakwet, Kiambu, Nandi, Uasin Gishu,
Kirinyaga, Bomet, Laikipia and Nyeri. The
number of candidates who were absent decreased by 6.20% from 10,367 in the year
2016 to 9,724 in the year 2017 KCPE examination. The
counties with the highest candidature in the 2017 KCPE examination were Nairobi
(56,073), Nakuru (50,046), Kakamega (46,448) and Bungoma (45,161). The four
counties have maintained the same positions for the last two years in this
aspect in the KCPE examination. The
Government recognises the rights of learners with disabilities as enshrined in
the Constitution. This year, 2,038 candidates with special needs sat the KCPE
examination, with the highest candidate scoring 426 marks out of the possible
500 marks. For
the second year, we implemented a directive by His Excellency President Uhuru
Kenyatta that we prepare and administer Special National Examination papers for
candidates with special needs.  With
great humility, I wish to again report that the examination was administered
successfully throughout the country between the 31st of October and 2nd of
November 2017. This success would not have been possible without the effort of
the 176,251 contracted professionals who included 26,457 supervisors, 61,817
invigilators, 52,590 security officers, 26,295 centre managers, 838 examination
management directors, 1,680 security officers manning containers and 6,574
drivers. I
wish to mention that the performance of candidates in this year’s examination
has generally improved compared to last year. Parents should not expect to go
through the annual nightmare of school placement since we have put in place
measures to ensure that all the candidates are admitted to secondary schools. The writer is the Education Cabinet Secretary
