Heavy but still inadequate rains have eased the water shortage and rationing will be relaxed. The Nairobi Water and Sewerage Company yesterday announced easing of rationing. Areas subject to rationing will receive one more day of water, the company said. This follows the increase in water level at Ndakaini dam to 42 per cent from 27 per cent. Acting managing director Nahashon Muguna said the volume of water in Ndakaini had been 18.9 million cubic metres or 27 per cent full. Today, the volume is 30 million cubic metres or 42 per cent,. “The rains are not very intensive in the Aberdares but at least the situation has improved. Areas like Kayole that used to receive water once a week, are now getting it for two days,” he said. Ndakaini supplies 84 per cent of the water used in the city and has a capacity of 70 million cubic metres. Residents in estates like BuruBuru, Uhuru Gardens, Umoja and Jamhuri have been suffering an acute water shortage, some buying water for as much as Sh80 for a 20-litre jerrycan. High costs have been blamed on cartels that supply water. On Tuesday, Governor Mike Sonko and Water CS Eugene Wamalwa announced the two governments would partner to sink at least a borehole in each of the 85 wards. “We agreed to request the nationalgovernment to subsidise water to the citizens in the informal sector within Nairobi City County,” Sonko said. He said water problems would be permanently resolved with the completion of the Northern Water Tunnel from Muranga and two other dams under construction. The tunnel is expected to increase water supply by 140 million litres. An additional 100 million litres or more will be supplied after construction and completion of Karimeni 2 and Ruiru 2 dams, Sonko said.
