Leaders from West Pokot have called for the arrest and sacking of security officers involved in the mass shooting and killing of livestock in Laikipia. The politicians accuse the police bosses of authorising officers to kill livestock during a security operation. More than 300 cattle were reportedly shot and killed in Olmoran, Laikipia, on November 1.  Speaking at Katimor during a livestock vaccination drive yesterday, West Pokot Governor John Lonyangapuo and Riwo MCA David Alekulem condemned the killings. “It is wrong to kill cows because they invaded a farm. They could have held onto the animals and waited for the owner,” Lonyangapuo said. The governor said shooting livestock is an agenda to expose pastoral communities to poverty.
