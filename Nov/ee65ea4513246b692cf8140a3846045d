Opera is the ultimate art form. Combining it all — music, literature, singing and design, opera engages all our senses. Four main aspects form its core. Librettos tell stories, stories of passions confronted with extraordinary situations and heightened feelings. Voices, ranging from soprano, mezzo-soprano, contralto (for women) and tenor, baritone and bass (for men), are associated with types of roles. Music, rhythms, tones, melodies and nuances create atmosphere that other art forms cannot create. And, finally, the visuals — costumes, make-up, lights and stage design — do not just illustrate the stories but represent the opera’s concepts and ideas. My next opera is Faust, one of the most famous and most performed of all operas.  A grand opera of large cast and orchestra and lavish design, was composed by a French composer Charles-François Gounod ( 818-93 ). Jules Barbier and Michel Carré’s wrote its libretto based on Michel Carré’s play ‘Faust et Marguerite’, which in turn is inspired by Goethe’s dramatic poem ‘Faust’, one of the great works of German literature. The opera was debuted at the Theatre Lyrique in Paris more than a century and a half ago, in 1859. The Faust’s plot is a tale of romance, temptation, and the age-old battle between satanic powers and religion. A story of ‘selling one’s soul to the devil’ in exchange for earthy gains is much relevant in today’s world. Faust, an aging philosopher and doctor, believes that his life’s work came to nothing and only caused him to miss out on love and the pleasures of life. Just as he contemplates suicide and drinking poison, Méphistophélès, ‘a spirit of hell’ and ‘agent of the devil’, appears with an image of a young maiden Marguerite. He promises to satisfy all of Faust’s pleasure-seeking demands in exchange for his soul. Faust agrees, and his poison is magically transformed into an elixir of youth, making Faust a handsome young man. Under the watchful eye of Méphistophélès, Faust seduces and abandons young and innocent Marguerite, and kills her brother, who wants to defend her. Marguerite gives birth to Faust’s child and becomes a social outcast. She tries to pray, but Méphistophélès stops her. Going mad, she kills her child. Visiting Marguerite in prison, Faust offers to rescue her. He stretches out his hand, but it is covered in blood. Marguerite prefers to trust her fate to God, and dies, leaving Faust in despair. The Royal Opera House’s lavish production of David McVicar’s, first seen in 2004, sets the opera’s action in Paris on the eve of the Franco-Prussian War. The designs include a memorable Cabaret d’Enfer and an impressive reconstruction of the Church of Saint-Séverin, conveying the clash between indulgence and piety. Méphistophélès’s charm, wit and rich bass voice —â€¯shown to best advantage by wonderful John Tomlinson — give him a demonic appeal.  Listen to the Méphistophélès’s zestful and rowdy much-loved ‘Song of the Golden Calf’ at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muy6DtnZ2Xg   Alla Tkachuk founded MASK creativity charity and the MASK Prize creativity competition, contact alla@mobileartschoolinkenya.org
