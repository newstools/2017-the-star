JKUAT has suspended studies indefinitely over the lecturers strike while Kenyatta University has rescheduled exams. "This is to inform all students currently in session in the main campus that all other scheduled activities have been suspended," JKUAT registrar Esther Muoria said on Wednesday. In the memo seen by The Star, Muoria asked students staying in the university to leave. "Further communication will be made as need be." KU acting VC Paul Wainaina said examination dates for the third semester will be changed and learners informed. "The university has decided to reschedule academic activities for this semester. Exams that were to take place on November 20 have been temporarily put on hold," he said. He added masters proposal defences were also postponed. Wainaina said they will issue another notice after consultations with the Education ministry and other stakeholders. "Remain calm as the issue is being addressed. A new schedule of semester activities will be communicated as soon as possible," he said in a memo. Varsities are pushing for higher perks as contained in the 2013-17 CBA drafted by universities, unions and the government. Lecturers said lack of accountability on the part of the government has caused strikes. "The deal was signed and payment had began but because a few individuals have decided not to do their job, we always go back to the same situation," said Peterson Hinga, University and Academic Staff Union secretary for the JKUAT chapter.
