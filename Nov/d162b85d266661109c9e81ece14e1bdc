A group of squatters were arrested and their animals impounded for allegedly trespassing disputed land belonging to former nominated MP and late Mark Too. The High Court in Eldoret early this year ordered that squatters at Kambi, Nandi area, be evicted from the land, which they claimed to have bought from the now-defunct East African Tanning and Extract Company. Too’s widow Sophie has denied claims by the squatters they are being frustrated because they claim to own part of the land in Eldoret town. They were evicted and their houses destroyed after Too’s family won a case against the squatters. Some of the families who claim to own the land are accused of destroying a fence around it to allow their animals into the area despite a court order that they keep away from the farm. At least seven squatters will be charged with trespass.
