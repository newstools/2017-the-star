Headteachers from Mbeere South subcounty have protested against the long distance they have to cover in distributing KCSE exam papers from the headquarters. Led by subcounty chairman for Kenya Secondary School Heads Association Moshe Musyoka, the principals said headquarters at Kiritiri is far from most schools in the area. Speaking to journalists on Thursday, Musyoka said there ought to have been more exam distribution centres in the subcounty. There are only two exam distribution centres at Karitiri and Karaba. Musyoka who spoke at Nyangwa Boys High School, where he is the principal, said school heads have been forced to wake up at 3am to ensure exam papers reach examination centres in time. “It has been a difficult job for most of us, especially schools at the border,” Musyoka said.
