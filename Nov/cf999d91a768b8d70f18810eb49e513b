There being no cases of malpractices in this year’s KCPE exam can be attributed to Education CS Fred Matiang’i tough rules, which sealed all cheating loopholes,  political activist Naomi Cidi has said. She said this has made girls perform relatively better than boys. “All these rules that Matiang’i has put in place has given us an opportunity to shine,” Cidi told the Star on the phone on Thursday. The top three students in the country are girls. Cidi said she will mobilise Kilifi women to reward the girls who scored 400 marks and above. “It will be a Christmas present for the girls,” she said. Cidi said the good performance calls for a celebration and should inspire others to excel. Cidi, the founder of the Coast People’s Forum, said, “This also goes for women in politics. If we can be given a free and fair election, believe me we can shine. Examinations and elections are always stolen from women.” She acknowledged both men and women cheat in both elections and exams, but added women are usually worst-affected. Cidi said women will thrive in politics if they have a level playing field.
