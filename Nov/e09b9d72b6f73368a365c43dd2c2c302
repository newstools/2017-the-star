Residents of Farmers Corner outside Limuru town are protesting against closure of the local AP camp, saying it has led to violence and more illicit liquor.  They said they would stage demonstrations next week against closure of the Kirathimo AP camp. It served as Limuru East ward headquarters. It was closed because it was located on property of the Red Cross Society, which demanded back their land. “Initially, without the AP camp, people could be robbed as early as 5pm by thugs who used to live here. But they were hunted down, some were arrested while others left. We fear they’ll return,” Monicah Njeri said. She said police also got rid of dangerous alcoholic drinks at local bars. “If there are not enough AP’s patrolling, alcoholic drinks that make many husbands impotent will come back. They forced women to look for sexual satisfaction from other men,” Njeri said. Limuru MP Peter Mwathi warned crime is likely to rise as the festive season approaches. “It is very important to note the AP camp has been closed when the festive season is around the corner. I join residents in demanding action since their plights are genuine,” Mwathi said. He said he will use CDF funds to build houses for police officers in Kirathimo. Limuru AP commander Gitonga Gathumi assured residents of their safety, saying officers will patrol 24 hours a day in the area. “There is nothing to worry about. Just share with us any information about suspicious people at any time,” Gathumi said. Last week boda boda riders protested against rising crime.
