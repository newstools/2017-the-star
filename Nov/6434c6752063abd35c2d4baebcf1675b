Rains will persist, drenching the city, causing both headaches and happiness. Open-market traders face problems as short rains continue and they do busines without shelter or shades. Many clothes sellers are forced to stop working. “Once it rains, we are forced to cover the clothes and wait for rains to stop. We count losses, especially in the morning since we target people gong to work,” trader Njenga said.  Motorists suffer too with traffic jams and potholes that turn into lakes. Landlords too are counting losses as residents move from slums as drains are overflowing. However, there is a silver lining for some lucky residents. Nursery owners don’t have to water plants. Shoe shiners do brisk business, cleaning muddy shoes. Car washes clean mud-splatetred cars. Umbrella sellers, boot seller and raincoat sellers are all making a killing.
