Kericho’s Ben Too’s ambition was to win colossal sums of money through betting to change his life but ended securing a job unlike huge money payouts paid by gaming firms for winners.  The opportunity for employment by Dafabet for the Bachelor of Commerce graduate, was a blessing in disguise after missing out on a trip to the UK to watch Premiership matches. Too, 27, who had won the trip to UK after winning the Dafabet “Twende Game” promotion had been denied travel visa only for the gaming firm to offer him a job.  He was offered some cash on top of the job offer as a consolation and reward for his loyalty. Too had won an all-expense paid trip to watch Premier League giants Arsenal play on Burnley away tomorrow, a day after watching Scottish champions Glasgow Celtic battle St Patrick Thistle in Scotland.  He said when he was retreating back to his normal life of doing menial jobs, he got a call from Dafabet for a visit to their Nairobi offices.
