Lake Turkana and coral reefs in the Indian Ocean are among 62 natural World Heritage Sites affected by climate change. According to a report released yesterday by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, at the UN climate change meeting being held in Bonn, Germany, the number of natural World Heritage Sites threatened by climate change has doubled from 35 to 62 in three years. The IUCN World Heritage Outlook report examined the threats, protection, management, status and the unique features of all 241 natural heritage sites. “This IUCN report sends a clear message that climate change acts fast and it is not sparing the finest treasures of our planet. The scale and pace at which it is damaging our natural heritage underlines the need for urgent and ambitious national commitment and actions to implement the Paris Agreement,” Inger Andersen, the IUCN director general, said.  The threatened sites include Lake Turkana, the Aldabra Atoll coral reefs in the Indian Ocean – which are the world’s second largest corals – and the retreating glaciers in Kilimanjaro National Park, which boasts Africa’s highest peak. In a statement, Tim Badman, the IUCN World Heritage programme director, said destruction of these sites can have devastating consequences that go beyond their exceptional beauty and natural value.
