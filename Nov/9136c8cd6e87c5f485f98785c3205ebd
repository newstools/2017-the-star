Diana Marua, wife to controversial gospel singer Bahati, is done with social media. Two days ago, the slay queen quit the public life days after Bahati was exposed for conning a Kenyan businessman. The businessman, Benson Thuranira, claims the singer used his money to fund his tradition wedding, claims Bahati is yet to respond to, as he is not picking calls. Anyhow, Marua hit the headlines late last year after the singer flaunted her all over his social media pages. Speculation has it that the newlyweds are expecting a baby. This comes weeks after their traditional wedding. But given how much the singer has been involved in recent controversies, it seems Marua is set to start a life off the public eye. Even with speculations from fans that there might be trouble in paradise, she might just be taking time off to enjoy her pregnancy. However, a little birdie whispered to The Raverend, claiming  she probably committed social media suicide because of the nasty DM (Direct messages). "Team mafisi out here are brutal. They don't care that Marua is a married woman: They will just slide into her DM ovyo ovyo tuu," our source close to the star's wife whispered. "Also, she probably will not miss all the trolls, who always littered her comments section with vitriol."  It is not clear if Bahati had a hand in pushing the wife to get off social media. Guys, stop sending DMs to women who are taken. Take your bad manners elsewhere.
