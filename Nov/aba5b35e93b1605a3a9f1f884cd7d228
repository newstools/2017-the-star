The price of fertiliser is set to go down starting next year in a government subsidy programme set to support farmers and increase maize production. According to Agriculture PS Richard Lesiyampe, the latest measures were part of the government’s plan to increase maize production and end importation. In an interview, the PS noted the country had the potential to produce more maize if farmers received support from the government. “The government will map crop production regions according to their suitability for the specific crops and concentrate on maize production,” he said. Lesiyampe noted that the ministry had already secured a Sh10 billion credit line for mechanization programme which will take effect from the beginning of the 2018 cropping season. “We shall fast-track implementation of this programme and encourage investment in machinery and adoption of conservation agriculture by private investors.”
