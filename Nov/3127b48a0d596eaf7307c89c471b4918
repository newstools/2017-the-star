The late Bishop Cornelius Korir brokered a peace deal that ended deadly clashes between two clans in Marakwet East in January. Former Marakwet East MP Jebii Kilimo yesterday said Korir and the Kenya Red Cross ended a protracted land feud pitting Kapshoi against Kapisiren clans in Tot. Korir united the warring clans at an Eldoret hotel and then proceeded with the peace message to the ground, where they met residents from January 1 -4. He was accompanied by other clerics. Their intervention took three days and the fights ended.  “I was called by Abas Gullet of the Red Cross on December 31. He asked me to work with Bishop Korir to unite the Kapshoi and Kapsiren clans. No one believed peace would be achieved in three days,” Kilimo said.
