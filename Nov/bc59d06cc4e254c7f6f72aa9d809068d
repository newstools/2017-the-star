A long and tense political season has resulted in major revenue loss in Uasin Gishu and the county may not meet its Sh1 billion annual target, Governor Jackson Mandago has said. County officials say they may have lost about Sh300 million in revenue collections this year. Mandago said many traders and residents failed to pay taxes for much of this year. He praised communities in Eldoret, including NASA supporters, for maintaining peace and unity. “We urge residents to go back to work. We’re through with the polls. They should ensure they pay taxes so we can use if to provide services,” he said. Mandago spoke during a visit to the Kipkaren dumpsite, where Sweden is to help put up a Sh500 million waste management project that will also generate electricity.  Swedish government officials, led by Ostergotland Governor Elisabeth Nilsson, met with Mandago to dicuss the county’s solid waste management strategy. Meanwhile, Rift Valley matatu operators want Jubilee and NASA to reduce tension and help revive the economy. Chairman Fred Wamu said the apex court’s decision to validate President Uhuru Kenyatta’s rerun victory should enable all Kenyans to move on. He said many sectors of the economy suffered during campaigns.
