The Central Organisation of Trade Union has told multinational tea companies in Kericho and Bomet counties to stop harassing striking workers. Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli said the strike by the tea picking workers is legal. Atwoli is also the Kenya Plantation and Agricultural Workers Union secretary general. "It is illegal and unacceptable for Unilever Tea Kenya and James Finlays to use police to intimidate our members who are on strike," Atwoli told the Star on phone yesterday. He said no worker will resume duty until they are advised to do so by the union. He accused the companies of violating their Collective Bargaining Agreements. The tea workers are in their third week of strike. Atwoli said the loses already incurred by the tea companies could have been saved and used to pay the workers. The strike was called by Atwoli. He said the work boycott is aimed at forcing the companies to honour their 2014/2015 CBAs. The workers have promised not to resume duty until the Kenya Tea Growers' Association honours the CBA. Both Unilever Tea Kenya and James Finlays are members of the association. Atwoli told the companies to swiftly address the demands of the workers. "They always prefer moving to court to frustrate our members instead of dealing with the grievances we have," Atwoli said. He also called to talks over a new CBA. â€œThe workers have not received any pay increase since 2014," he said. Finlays said it had recorded losses close to Sh1 billion since the strike began. It said the loses include property destroyed by the striking employees. KPAWU Kericho branch secretary general Dickson Sang denied their members had destroyed the company's property. "Our members only engaged in peaceful demonstrations," Sang said. The Labour Court had awarded the workers a 30 per cent pay increase. But the KTGA appealed the decision, saying they cannot afford it. They had paid 15 per cent and the workers are demanding the remaining 15 per cent be paid to them.
