A Nairobi court yesterday summoned the Nairobi Central police station OCS over claims of mistreatment of suspects and poor cell conditions. Milimani chief magistrate Francis Andayi issued the summons after a suspect complained that the station does not have toilets, bathrooms and water, among other amenities. Robert Kuria said the odour of human excreta forces suspects to spend the night huddled in the corridors. “When l wanted to use the toilet, l discovered that there was none, no running water and the floor was already full of human excreta,” he said. Kuria said the conditions of the cells are inhuman and degrading. The accused said he had endured the inhuman conditions since Monday following his arrest for alleged impersonation. Kuria pleaded not guilty to the charge of impersonating an officer of the Music Copyright Society of Kenya in the CBD.  The charge sheet states that on November 13, at Eudiko Communications Ltd offices in Victoria Court House on Tom Mboya Street, he pretended to be an officer of MCSK and approached Richard Wafula. He allegedly demanded Sh31,000 from Wafula. Andayi granted him Sh200,000 bond or Sh100,000 bail. The hearing was set for December 6. Andayi ordered the accused escorted to Capitol Hill police station to record a statement with the OCS and returned to court this morning for further directions.
