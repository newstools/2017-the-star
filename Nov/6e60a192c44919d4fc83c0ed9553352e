Motorists accessing Ngong Road from Valley Road have been told to use alternatives routes as the section will be closed for two weeks to allow completion of construction. Kenya Urban Roads Authority yesterday asked motorists to expect traffic congestion along Ngong Road following the closure that begins today. It runs through December 8. The busy section provides access to the City Mortuary roundabout. “Motorists wishing to access Daystar University and Nairobi Hospital via the upper gate through Doctors’ Plaza will not be affected,” Kura said. Motorists using Argwings Kodhek Road have been advised to access Ngong Road via Ralph Bunche Road. President Uhuru Kenyatta launched the expansion of Ngong Road in August 2016. The expansion of the 2.57 kilometre stretch that ends at Prestige Plaza will cost Sh1.3 billion. The project is funded by a grant from the Japanese government. The work is being done by Japanese firm World Kaihatsu Kogyo Ltd. Work is only 22 per cent complete.
