It will be unfortunate if the British Army Training Unit in Kenya pulls out of the country, Laikipia Governor Ndiritu Muriithi has said. Speaking to the Star in Nanyuki town yesterday, Muriithi called for a formal handling of the issues between Kenya and UK. He said he had been reading in the media several allegations and claims about Batuk pulling out of the country. Muriithi said there exist defence cooperation between Kenya and the United Kingdom which should continue. He said he is willing to address any challenges that Batuk was facing in Laikipia. He said the army had created a huge economic base in the county and that it would be a loss if it pulled out. The soldier conduct their training in Laikipia, Isiolo and Samburu counties. Muriithi said more than 1,000 personnel, both local and international are involved. “I did see a newspaper report about the presence of Batuk here in Laikipia and that there are some difficulties in their continued stay. I have found that surprising,” Muriithi said. The troops have been training on leased private and community lands. Muriithi said previous files from the county government indicated they were paying Sh650,000 per license. “If there are anxieties, it would be unfortunate. If Batuk are interested in training in these private and community ranches, they should do so within the confines of the law,” Muriithi said. He said he would give the matter serious thoughts once they are formally presented to his office.
