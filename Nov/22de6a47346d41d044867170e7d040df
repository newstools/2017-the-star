Nakumatt manager Abdul Kairo’s (pictured) murder case will be mentioned on November 21. Justice Jessie Lessit adjourned the case to allow the defence and the DPP to reach a plea bargain agreement. Kairo is accused of murdering a junior worker at the supermarket chain’s headquarters in Nairobi on November 10, 2015. Kairo has denied fatally shooting Stephen Wafula, 23. He allegedly shot him twice in the chest in unclear circumstances.  The accused is out on Sh1 million bail.  Nakumatt head of security Michael Ndung’u was reported in the media as having told police Wafula appeared to be mentally disturbed.  He said Wafula started chasing his colleagues with a panga and a spade.  Ndung’u said Wafula attacked Kairo, who shot him at point-blank range in self-defence.  But some witnesses told the police the manager was not attacked and he walked from his office to where Wafula was and shot him.  It is said the police ruled out a theory that Kairo shot to immobilise the armed “innocent” casual labourer.
