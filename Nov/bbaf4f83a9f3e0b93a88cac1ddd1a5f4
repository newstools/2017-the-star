Nominated MP Cecily Mbarire has told Opposition chief Raila Odinga that he is day dreaming by demanding for a transition government to prepare a fresh election. She said Raila has thrown the Constitution out of the window and using jungle law to get power. Mbar ire said formation of an interim government is not provided for by any Kenyan law. The MP who spoke to the Star on the phone argued that Raila has on several occasions held the country hostage with his aim of grabbing power through the back door after failing to do so constitutionally. She expressed disgust that Raila filed a petition against the election of President Uhuru Kenyatta after the August 8 General Election and succeeded, but instead of participating in the repeat election, he withdrew.
