Police have been condemned for using excessive force against herders accused of invading private ranches in Laikipia. The National Cohesion and Integration Commission said police officers were brutal to herders and livestock and that they also destroyed property. Police last week conducted an operation to flush out pastoralists thought to have invaded private ranches in Laikipia county. It resulted in huge losses. Over 300 cows were killed. Speaking on Friday in Nairobi, NCIC chairman Francis ole Kaparo said the commission did not support the brutality exhibited by police. Kaparo said police actions could stir tension and cause violence in the troubled region. “The police action is a threat to the fragile peace and cohesion in Laikipia and the neighbouring Samburu county. We urge them to devise humane means of conducting such operations so they don’t increase tension,” Kaparo said. He called for constructive dialogue to avert future loss of lives and property. He also warned residents against taking the law into their hands. “We urge the residents to remain patient and embrace tolerance. We are working with relevant institutions towards an agreeable approach to the problem,” he said.  Ranch owners in Laikipia have asked the state to strengthen security in the region following invasion of their farms by herders from Samburu and Baringo. The herders are looking for pasture for their livestock. On Febraury 8, Rumuruti OCPD Merengo Muherai was shot and seriously injured by the herders. In March, the body of Sosian ranch owner Tristian Voorspuy was found dumped in his farm. He died of bullet wounds. In May, renowned conservationist and author Kuki Gallmann was also shot and seriously injured by herders who invaded her Gallmann Africa Conservancy in Laikipia.
