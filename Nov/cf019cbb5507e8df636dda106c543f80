Human rights activist Okiya Omtatah yesterday moved to court seeking to bar the KRA board from extending John Njiraini’s tenure. Omtatah wants the court to retire Njiraini immediately and order recruiting and appointing of a new commissioner general for the KRA in strict compliance with the law. He said the impugned intended extension of the tenure is discriminatory against all public officials who have exited the public service upon turning 60 years old. Omtatah further says from the time Njiraini turned 58 years, the board, together with Treasury CS Henry Rotich were required by law to identify his possible successors to enable his smooth exit when he attains the mandatory retirement age of 60. Njiraini was born December 20, 1957. He ought to have vacated office and proceeded on the mandatory six months terminal leave, pending retirement. Njiraini will attain the mandatory retirement age in the public service of 60 on December 19. Omtatah has faulted the KRA board of directors and Rotich for retaining Njiraini in the public service contrary to the policy to send exiting CEOs on six months terminal leave.  “I invite the honorable court to intervene and determine the constitutional and legal validity of the impugned extension of service for the Interested Party,” Omtatah says. He further said keeping the KRA boss in employment beyond the mandatory retirement age of 60 years for public servants will be illegal and unconstitutional and, therefore, invalid, null and void.
