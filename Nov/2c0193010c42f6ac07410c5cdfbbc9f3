"Most of us have been surviving on handouts from politicians. We need to find a way to empower ourselves," she said.

One of their resolutions was writing a Bill to be submitted to the assembly. Sokoke MCA Harrison Taura said Kilifi artistes have been left behind for long. “We understand formal jobs are not for everyone. We can create employment for artists, singers, acrobats, traditional artistes and graphic designers," he said. Mohamed Said alias Bado, a popular musician, said the idea was timely and that it would transform their lives.
