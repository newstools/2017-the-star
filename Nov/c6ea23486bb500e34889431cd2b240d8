In my mind, I knew it was some sort of machines fighting and shooting after watching the trailer. The movie began with a bit of emotions where Thor (Chris Hemsworth) who was imprisoned on the other side of the universe without his mighty hammer, which was crashed into pieces by the powers of his sister, Hela (Cate Blanchett), who is the goddess, returns from exile to claim the throne of Asgard, thrashing Thor and his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) banishing them from fighting pits of Sakaar. Thor's opening search for the infinity stones, has led him to be imprisoned by the fire demon Sutur. The demon tells him that his father Odin (Antony Hopkins) is no longer on Asgard and that their homeworld will soon be destroyed in Ragnarok, a prophesied apocalypse. They are reunited with the missing since Ultron Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) finds himself racing against time to get back to Asgard to stop Ragnarok - the destruction of his homeworld and the end of Asgardian civilization - at the hands of an all powerful new threat, the ruthless Hela. But first, he must survive a deadly gladiatorial contest that pits him against his former ally and fellow Avenger - the Incredible Hulk. At the end I thought Loki had died while fighting with Hela. And it was all a happy moment when Thor managed to save the people as well including Heimdall (Idris Elba). It was quite worth the wait for Thor fans.
