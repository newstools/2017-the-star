Kusu yesterday demanded the immediate resignation of Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology vice chancellor Frederick Otieno. Union officials accused Otieno of harassment, transfer, suspension and unfair treatment of workers involved in investigations into the abuse of office claims. Otieno is also accused of embezzling funds. “He has to step aside. He has no legal mandate or moral authority to continue serving after the investigations. His stay is painting a bad picture and precedence within the education sector in the country,” said Kusu secretary general Charles Mukhwaya (pictured). He spoke in Nakuru town. This comes two weeks after the EACC wrote to the MMUST council chairman Jeremy Bundi, directing him to suspend Prof Otieno over the allegations. The letter, signed by EACC secretary Halakhe Waqo, directed Bundi to ensure that Otieno remains on half-pay until ongoing investigations are complete.
