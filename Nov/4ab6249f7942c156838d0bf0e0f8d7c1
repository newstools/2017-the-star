Lecturers have taken their strike a notch higher, petitioning the Senate to spearhead negotiations of their 2017-22 CBA. They also want the House to intervene in the unfulfilled 2013-17 CBA. The striking dons want the senators to summon public university and government officials for grilling to “urgently” help end the strike that is in its fourth week. The petition comes as Treasury PS Kamau Thugge last week announced the release of Sh5.4 billion to clear the 2013-17 CBA arrears, including pension contributions by their employers. Universities’ Academic Staff Union secretary general Constantine Wasonga (pictured) insisted that lecturers will not resume work until all their CBA issues are resolved. “The petitioners pray that the Senate investigates this matter and makes appropriate recommendations. [They want the] Senate to urgently intervene to have the 2017-22 CBA for universities’ academic staff concluded,” Speaker Kenneth Lusaka said. The dons indict public universities for “habitually” failing to remit statutory deductions such as income tax, pension contributions, NSSF and NHIF subscriptions, despite deducting cash from their incomes. Kisii Senator Sam Ongeri told the government to honour the deal. Uasin Gishu Senator Margaret Kamar said the strike is hurting students. “Whatever is bargained for should be fulfilled within the limits,” she said. Bomet Senator Christopher Langat demanded that universities be “seriously investigated”. Click here for the latest political news
