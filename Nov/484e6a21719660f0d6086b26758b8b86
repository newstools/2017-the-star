Bomet county is committed to supporting all children's home and charity activities, Governor Joyce Laboso has said. Laboso said the homes and integrated institutions in the county were faced with many challenges and called for support. She spoke on Monday, when she launched the Governor’s Christmas Tree Fund in Bomet town. The fund will support 23 children homes spread across the county’s five constituencies. Laboso said she will visit the homes to access their conditions. She called on corporate institutions, donor agencies, businessmen and well wishers to donate funds, foodstuffs and clothing during the Christmas season to support the homes. “We are launching the Governor’s Christmas Tree Fund so that men and women of compassion and goodwill can rally around this initiative to pool together resources and become a blessing to those who are disadvantaged in the society,” Laboso said.
