An MP on Wednesday dedicated a brief moment during a burial ceremony to pray for Tanzanian President John Magufuli to repent his sins. Kajiado East legislator Peris Tobiko said Magufuli requires prayers to make him understand his neighbours, not condemn them. Residents had expected her to make a political statement against Magufuli’s action to auction 1,305 head of cattle belonging to the Kajiado Ilkisonko Maasai. “Because of our cordial relationship with Tanzania, I don’t wish to reprimand Magufuli for his unwarranted actions but to seek heavenly intervention to change him,” the MP said. Tobiko said the Kajiado Maasai believe in living in peace with their neighbours. Speaking in Kagera on Tuesday, Magufuli said Tanzania is not a livestock grazing farm for Kenya. He added that he will take stern legal action against those trespassing with animals into the country. Magufuli asked Kenya to do the same and confiscate Tanzanian livestock that cross to its territory illegally. Kajiado Governor Joseph Lenku termed “shameful” the East African leader’s way of handling cross-border issues. Lenku accused Magufuli of creating a wedge between the Maasai communities living on the border of the two countries. Tobiko on Wednesday said, “Our people have been frustrated by unending drought and this is the reason why they crossed to Tanzania to seek pasture for their starving livestock. It is disheartening that a leader can order the auctioning of livestock belonging to poor Kenyan families”. The MP revisited the killing of more than 300 cows on November 1 in Laikipia and claimed the police have been infiltrated by economic “saboteurs from the National Resistance Movement”. Tobiko said officers involved in the shooting of 300 cows belonging to Laikipia pastoralists were “acting for the opposition”.
