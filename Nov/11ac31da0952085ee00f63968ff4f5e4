Yesterday President Uhuru Kenyatta was sworn in and promised to be president for all 40 million Kenyans, whatever their views. Yesterday the Star reported that Jubilee had made overtures to Nasa to return Kenya to normalcy, although the intermediary Oburu Odinga denied it. Yet yesterday police broke up a Nasa rally next to Jacaranda with live bullets and tear gas. They provided free publicity for Raila Odinga to claim that Kenya is now an oppressive dictatorship. How unfortunate that the police did not follow the conciliatory note sounded by Uhuru. Raila yesterday said he will be sworn in as president on December 12 by the Peoples Assembly. This is legally meaningless as a President has to be sworn in by the Chief Justice but the Jubilee government must not fall into the trap of over-reacting. After all, Kizza Besigye was 'sworn in' as president in Uganda in 2016 but no-one considers him president. He is not a threat to the state. So now that they are in power, let Jubilee follow the path of reconciliation rather than confrontation. Quote of the day "Failures, repeated failures, are finger posts on the road to achievement.
