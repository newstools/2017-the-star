NASA will this week add more products to their boycott list as it escalates its war on electoral injustice. CEO Norman Magaya yesterday said the National Resistance Movement committee wing of the alliance has identified more companies that had a hand in bungling the August 8 presidential polls. He said they will inform their supporters of the products. “We’ll make it known this week. We are going to escalate very seriously. The list is growing,” Magaya told the Star. ODM chairman John Mbadi said NASA will advise its supporters to boycott products from any firm found culpable of abetting electoral fraud. “It’s about companies that played a major role in subverting the will of the people and democracy. There is an NRM committee. If they recommend others, we’ll include them,” he said. NASA currently has Safaricom, Bidco and Brookside products on its list. Before leaving the country for the US early this month, NASA leader Raila Odinga led leaders in ditching Safaricom for Airtel. NASA accused Safaricom of transmitting results from the polling stations directly to a cloud server registered in Spain — not to the IEBC server in France, as per their contract. Safaricom has denied these claims. Magaya said the ongoing boycott is a success. “The boycott is extremely effective. It has even surpassed our expectations,” he said. Mbadi added, “Just ask the distributors of those products or the firms — you’ll get the response.”  NASA also plans a series of countrywide demonstrations to push for a six-month transitional government. They dismissed as irrelevant High Court Judge L.N Mutende’s order stopping the adoption of the People’s Assembly motion.
