Former US President Barack Obama took a jab at President Donald Trump joking that he was "born in Kenya." The remarks come after President Trump pushed for harsher immigration policies in the United States. Read: Trump could kick 30,000 Kenyans out in January When Obama was in office, Trump repeatedly claimed that Obama was not an American and was born in Kenya. Having Kenyan roots, Obama was born in Hawaii in 1961. "The reason I am excited to see you here today is because this is where I started ... this isn't where I was born, I was born in Kenya ... it's a joke, I was born in Hawaii," Obama said. Obama addressed 500 young leaders from 60 nations and 27 US states at the start of the Obama Foundation’s first global summit in Chicago on Tuesday. He said at a time of political divisiveness, more civic activism was needed to solve community problems across the nation. Obama kicked off a two-day leadership summit in his hometown of Chicago by saying it marked the start of a wider effort to promote civic activism, a cause that has emerged as a major emphasis of his post-presidency. "Our goal here is not to create a political movement," Obama said. "What we need to do is think about our civic culture. Because what's wrong with our politics is partly a reflection of something wrong in our civic culture," Obama said in an address that did not mention Trump. His foundation is hosting training around the United States this fall to teach community leaders to organize to solve problems, foundation officials said. The summit is being held on the South Side of Chicago, where the Obama Foundation plans to build a presidential center near the neighborhoods that gave rise to Obama's own activism and propelled him to two terms in the White House. He said the summit would lay the foundation for a global platform to help young leaders spark bottom-up change in their own communities.
