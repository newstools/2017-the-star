Counties are on the spot for blowing billions of shillings on salaries and allowances for staff, hurting development and hindering budget implementation.   The counties spent a Sh130.97 ( 41.1 per cent) of their total expenditure of Sh319.06 billion on personal emoluments in 2016-17. Only Sh84.74 billion ( 26.6 per cent) was spent on operations and maintenance. ShSh103.34 billion ( 32.4 per cent) was spent on development for the the 2016-17 financial year. According to the controller of budget’s budget implementation report, 34 counties reported expenditure on personnel emoluments that exceeded 35 per cent of their total expenditure for the 2016-17 financial year. Regulation 25( 1 )(a) of the Public Finance Management (County Governments) Regulations 2015 requires that a county’s total wage bill should not exceed 35 per cent of the total revenue  “The office notes that, the high wage bill is unsustainable and will negatively affect spending on development activities,” says Controller of Budget Agnes Odhiambo. Review of personnel emoluments as percentage of total expenditure indicates Tharaka Nithi, Taita Taveta, and Nairobi recorded the highest percentage at 60.1 per cent, 58.9 per cent and 54 per cent, respectively. The explosive budget performance report for the 47 counties shows that Nairobi, Kilifi, Mombasa, Wajir and Nandi incurred illegal expenses without approval by the Budget Controller. The report shows counties closed the last financial year in July with Sh41 billion idle in the Central Bank. Of Sh369.45 billion available for counties, COB authorised withdrawals of Sh328.24 billion from County Revenue Funds to County Operational Accounts, leaving the balance unspent.  On revenue collection, county governments raised Sh32.52 billion, 56.4 per cent of annual local revenue target of Sh57.66 billion. This performance represented a decline of 7.1 per cent from Sh35.02 billion generated in the preceding financial year,  2015-16.
