 The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission has recommended the suspension of a university vice chancellor for intimidating and demoting staff involved in a graft probe. EACC chief executive Halakhe Waqo said Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology VC Fredrick Ochieng intimidated staff through transfers, demotions, interdiction and dismissals. The staff were involved in a probe against him for abuse of office, embezzlement of funds and employment irregularities. The recommendations are contained in a letter dated November 10 addressed to the university’s council chairman Jeremy Bundi. Waqo said Ochieng’s actions against staff amounted to interference of investigations contrary to the EACC Act. “Further, he has threatened to victimise whoever gives information as he continues to engage in unethical behaviour and cover up for the past vices by preventing our investigators from obtaining documents,” Waqo said.
