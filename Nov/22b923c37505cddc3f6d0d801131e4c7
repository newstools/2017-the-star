The 59, 017 Kitutu Chache South voters go to the polls tomorrow to elect their MP. Six candidates are seeking to end outgoing MP Richard Onyonka’s bid for a third term. The election was put off after Jubilee candidate Leonard Mwamba died in a road accident on July 14. Antony Kibagendi is the new JP candidate. Clannism and sibling rivalry among NASA affiliate parties ODM, Ford Kenya, Wiper and ANC are likely to determine the winner. NASA’s major affiliates failed to win any parliamentary seat in the eight constituencies of Kisii county on August 8 because of internal competition. Onyonka has received a major boost after NASA leader Raila Odinga abandoned ODM’s Samuel Omwando and backed him. Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang’ula and Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa have also campaigned for Onyonka, who is defending his seat on the Ford Kenya ticket. Raila said they agreed to back Onyonka, despite ANC, ODM and Wiper having their candidates. But ODM deputy director of elections Bob Njagi said on Saturday Raila is behind Omwando. He spoke when he accompanied Omwando at a campaign rally
