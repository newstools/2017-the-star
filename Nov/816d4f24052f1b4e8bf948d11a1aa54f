A woman will be detained longer for allegedly stabbing her husband to death with a kitchen knife after a quarrel in Mathare. On Monday, Milimani resident magistrate Christine Njagi gave Stahere detectives 10 days to continue holding Irene Awuor until they finish investigating. Awuor has been accused of killing Simon Onyango by stabbing him in the chest. The order followed a sworn affidavit by Richard Wesonga, who is one of the investigators in the murder case.  Wesonga told the court they needed more time to complete investigations since the suspect was arrested on November 26. The officer reported that they recovered the weapon but needed to collect more evidence. The investigators said they will conduct a postmortem, obtain a blood sample and forward exhibits to the government chemist for analysis. "We also need to take the suspect to a psychiatrist for mental assessment and obtain witnesses' statements." The suspect will be detained at Pangani police station.
