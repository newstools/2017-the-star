Having been declared the winner of the repeat Presidential election by the Supreme Court, it is time for President Uhuru to roll up his sleeves and get to work. And it is time for him to cut the profile of the father of the nation, not merely leader of Jubilee Party. A lot of serious problems face Kenya and the President in his second and final term must not be diverted by factionalism and other rivalries. The biggest problems are ethnic division and the state of the economy after the most prolonged electoral cycle in Kenyan history. The Cabinet and bureaucratic appointments that President Uhuru makes must be inspired and inclusive. The new Cabinet Secretaries, Principal Secretaries and state corporation CEOs will find themselves in a Kenya that is pulling in more directions than ever. Every policy and initiative that they undertake should be calculated to unite Kenyans, not disunite them. This is President Uhuru’s legacy term.  He and his team must do everything possible to make it a positive legacy.
