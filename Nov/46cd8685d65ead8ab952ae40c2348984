Running contracts of county executives, delay in release of funds by the National Treasury has delayed naming of CEC nominees by Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya. His handlers said the governor will unveil his proposed new look cabinet next week. Oparanya and his Busia counterpart Sospeter Ojaamong have not named their nominees for vetting by their respective county assemblies. “You are aware the contracts for the current CECs expires by end of November. It was only prudent that the governor waits until the terms of the CECs end before naming a new team to avoid being taken to court, which will stall the entire process,” Acting county chief of staff Musa Chibole said. The current executives are said to be uneasy as they wait to know if Oparanya will reappoint them or send them home. Sources yesterday told the Star that most of the current CECs could be thrown out for allegedly under-performing. “One of the executive reapplied for the job and her husband also applied under a different name, but it was discovered and they were both disqualified,” the source said. During his swearing in on August 28, Oparanya said he would form a government that will work with the people to secure his legacy. He said he would sack lazy officials and only retain performers. Meanwhile, Ojaamong has asked Busia residents to be patient and wait for his new look cabinet. His handlers said he was waiting for the determination of an election petition filed by former Funyula MP Paul Otuoma, challenging his victory before unveiling his cabinet. Delays by the Treasury to release funding to county governments is also said to be part of the challenges in naming the county cabinets. Vihiga Governor Wilber Ottichilo swore his cabinet into office on October 27.  Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati has named the nominees, but a certain community has moved to court to contest "exclusion".
