Giant sports gaming company SportPesa will be in focus again tomorrow after making it to the final list of the reputable UK Football Business Awards that will take place in London. The awards, which are held annually, seek to recognise and reward organisations that support the success of the game. They are held to celebrate achievements off the pitch. Only three companies, among them SportPesa, have been nominated twice in the shortlist of 97 that comprises English Premier League clubs, various charities, media companies, hospitality companies and gaming firms among others. SportPesa is shortlisted under the category of Best Brand Activation involving football for its campaigns with English Premier League giants, Everton FC and EFL Championship outfit—Hull City Tigers. “This is a true honour and a reflection of our dedication to develop football in the markets that we operate in. By being one of only three finalists to get two nominations, it speaks volumes about the scope and impact of the work that we do regarding the growth of football,” said SportPesa CEO Ronald Karauri. SportPesa will be competing for the Best Brand Activation involving football Award. The glitzy awards gala will be held at the iconic Tobacco Dock in London. SportPesa signed a record deal with Everton FC in May, earning the company a slot in the finalists list of the Brand Activation award category for its very first engagement with club which saw the Blues make a historic tour of Tanzania in celebration of the partnership. The tour made Everton the first EPL team to play in East Africa when they beat 2017 SportPesa Super Cup champions, Kenya’s Gor Mahia FC 2-1 in Dar-es-Salaam on July 13. The EPL team conducted a series of engaging community activities on the side-lines of their landmark visit.
