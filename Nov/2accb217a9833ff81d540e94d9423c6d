Gospel star Mercy Masika has bagged a multimillion-shilling endorsement deal with Ariel that will see her traverse the country to empower women. Masika has been named as the brand ambassador of the brand in East Africa. The Mwema hitmaker will be going round various women groups across the country not only teaching them best ways to wash but also on what it means to be a smart woman, a woman of value. “Mercy is not only a celebrated household name but she is also a resilient woman,” Francisco Gala, the Ariel brand manager, said. The brand believes Masika will continue to uplift Kenyans through her music.  “Ariel has the message of best value in these tough times, and as a consumer of the product, I bear witness to the promise of one wash. I appreciate this opportunity to work with Ariel as it is a brand that interacts with many women, educating and uplifting them. Last week, I joined them for a session in Ruiru and it was an exciting opportunity as I interacted and sang with the women . As a mentor for women in my foundation, I see this as an opportunity to reach a greater number of women and offer them hope and inspiration” Masika said.
