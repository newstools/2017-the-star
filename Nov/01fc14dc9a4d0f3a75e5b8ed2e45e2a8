The Coast economic bloc is not dead. The secretariat is developing a blueprint to  eradicate hunger, drought and disease. The Jumuiya ya Kunti za Pwani technical committee chairman Dr William  Kingi (pictured) said a paper on Agriculture, Livestock, Fisheries and Health is complete. “It awaits presentation to the six Coast governors and the launch,” the Mombasa Deputy Governor said. “At the political level, there have been squabbles but technically, the fire is burning. We have done a lot. It is wrong to claim JKP was dead,” he said in an interview with the Star yesterday. The launch date and venue has not been set. The blueprint seeks to make the Coast food secure and the most healthy region in Eastern Africa, Kingi said. Professionals and the secretariat started developing the document after entering a deal with Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. There were reports JKP is dysfunctional owing to heated political temperatures and different leanings. The first governors of Coast were all opposition-friendly and were able to meet and push JKP plans. But some, including its chairman Kwale Governor Saalim Mvurya , shifted to Jubilee mid-way, making meetings difficult. As a result, superficially, it emerged the bloc was a pipe dream. On Monday, Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho said the EU has agreed to partner with JKP. However, former Kilifi North MP Gideon Mung’aro, who opposes the bloc, maintains it is a “money-minting body”. “They should first account for the millions used for hiring choppers and holding meetings,” Mung’aro said. “JKP is unsurvivable,” he said.
