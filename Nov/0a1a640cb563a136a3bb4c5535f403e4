The race for promotion to the Sportpesa Premier League is now a four horse race. With the Football Kenya Federation and Kenya Premier League Company differing on the relegation and promotion criteria, the four top teams in the NSL now stand a chance for promotion. FKF wants two teams promoted automatically from the Super League with the third battling it out in a playoff with the 15th placed team in the SPL. The top four teams—Ushuru, Vihiga United, Wazito and Kenya Commercial Bank—are separated by two points with three matches to go. Ushuru top the league with 72 points followed by Vihiga United on 71. Third placed Wazito also have 71 points but with an inferior goal aggregate while KCB are fourth on 70 points. The four clubs go into Sunday’s fixtures knowing that any slip up will cost them a place in next year’s top tier league. Log leaders Ushuru travel to Kisumu, where they face Palos from 3pm in a must-win match. Palos have lost their last two games and will prove hard nuts to crack as they seek to finish in respectable positions. Third-placed Wazito play Nakuru All Stars at Afraha Stadium in Nakuru while fourth-placed KCB face fifth-placed Nairobi Stima in the second match at Camp Toyoyo. In the first match, Talanta host Isibania at 2pm. Vihiga will not be in action this weekend and take on Palos on Wednesday at Moi Stadium in Kisumu. “We are targeting to win all our remaining matches. We want to avoid any slip ups in remaining assignment,” Vihiga coach Edward Manoah said.
