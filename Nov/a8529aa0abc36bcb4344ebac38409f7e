Mr Tee has opened up about his relationship with his wife by posting a photo of him baptizing his wife. "God gives us seeds to plant, water, prune and tend to. Many people are looking for a complete woman. You better look for a woman you will complete not compete. I was also a seed to her. Most people think romantic moments are coffee dates, holiday trips and special moments that you spend together. That's should be your lifestyle and those should be the basic moments. I led my wife to Christ, I baptised her, I discipled her and I'm still doing it. I'm a proud husband, priest and Bff to her. One of my romantic moments is when I baptised her as her priest and husband-to-be then," he wrote, "A real man sets Godly footprints for her woman to walk on. With time I know she will be thundering with mysteries and prophetic tongues." Â
