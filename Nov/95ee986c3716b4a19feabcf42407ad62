Safaricom’s service revenues for the half year have moved up to Sh109.73 billion as at September 30, from Sh98.01 billion posted over a similar period last year. This is a 12 per cent growth attributed to growth in active users and increased usage of non–voice services, mainly Mpesa and mobile data. The two saw the mobile service provider record a 9.5 per cent rise in its net income to Sh26.20 billion, up from Sh23.93 billion recorded last year. Mpesa contributed 16.2 per cent of their revenue while data contributed 31 per cent of the same. Mpesa revenue moved up to Sh30.05billion driven by a 9.5 per cent increase in 30-day active Mpesa customers to 19.3 million. Mobile data revenue grew to Sh17.55billion. This was driven by 13.5per cent growth in 30-day active mobile data customers to 16.9 million, increased bundle users and increased smartphone penetration during the period. Despite the growth, the telco’s chairperson, Nicholas Ng’ang’a, noted that the operating environment has been unfavourable, having a negative impact on their customer spending. He outlined a forecasted drop in economic growth by international bodies, a dip in credit growth caused by implementation of the 2016 Banking Amendment Act, the ongoing drought and regulatory conditions as among the key challenges affecting the industry. “According to our internal research, all these factors have also had a significant impact on how our customers are spending. Over the past four months, monthly household expenditure across Kenya has been compressed by an average Sh2, 800,” he said. Also contributing largely to its service revenue is the non-voice service that accounted for 56.8 per cent, recording a growth of 19.3 per cent to Sh62.38 billion. Voice service revenue now stands at 43.2 per cent of service revenue and remained resilient in the year, growing by 3.6 per cent to Sh47.35 billion within the period under review. The firm also announced a 10.8 per cent increase to 29.5 million customers, hence recording a leading subscriber share of 72.6 per cent. Moving forward, Ng’ang’a hinted at the possibility of the firm expanding to external markets in the next few years. He added that while in this market, they will only focus on mobile payments. This comes even as Mpesa transfer and payments transactions grow at a faster rate than withdrawals, registering a 31 per cent year on year growth. Also, as part of their diversification strategy, the telco announced its plans to unveil their flagship e-commerce project on November 16, to be known as Masoko. This will see them compete with players in the retail industry such as Jumia and Kilimall.
