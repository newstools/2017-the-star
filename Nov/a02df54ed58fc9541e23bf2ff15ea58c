The county government, residents and leaders across Bungoma’s nine constituencies have been asked to stop the stigma against persons living with disability. Kenya Re corporate affairs manager Gladys Some said it is saddening that the disabled suffer but are unable to speak out against stigma. She distributed wheelchairs to the disabled on Thursday at Bungoma Medical Training College. Some called for better support from county leaders. Kenya Re and the Association for the Physically Disabled of Kenya, have distributed 400 assistive and mobility devices to the disabled in Bungoma and Kitale.
