Nyeri Deputy Governor Mutahi Kahiga, who is set to take over following the death of Governor Wahome Gakuru yesterday morning, will likely serve without a deputy as the Constitution is silent on that point. The Constitution states that a deputy governor shall take over the position of a governor for the remainder of the term when a vacancy arises. It is, however, silent on who shall fill the vacancy left by the elevated deputy governor. This means that for the second time in less than a year, Nyeri county will remain without a substantive deputy governor when Kahiga is sworn in anytime now. In March, the then Deputy Governor Sammy Wamathai took over after the death of Governor Nderitu Gachagua. Constitution Article 179 (7) states, “If a vacancy arises in the office of the county governor, the members of the county executive committee appointed by the governor cease to hold office.” Gakuru died inaa road accident yesterday morning at Kabati on the Thika-Sagana highway in Murang’a county. He was rushed to Thika Level 5 Hospital for emergency treatment, but succumbed to his injuries.  Gakuru, 51, was travelling to Nairobi for an interview when he a tyre burst and his driver lost control, hitting a guard rail.  His body is at the Lee Funeral Home, Nairobi. Witnesses said the governor and his driver were trapped in his Mercedes- Benz for close to an hour before they were pulled out. Gakuru had only been in office for about 90 days since winning in the August 8 General Election. He defeated his main opponent by a wide margin, some 280,000 votes.  In the 2013 General Election Gakuru lost to Gachagua. He ran on the TNA ticket. This time round he ran on the Jubilee Party ticket and went on to defeat Wamathai.
