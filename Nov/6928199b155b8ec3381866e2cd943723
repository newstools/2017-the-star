Residents of Kasemeni and Mikameni villages in Lunga Lunga have asked security officers to protect them from constant attacks by panga-wielding killers. They say their lives are in dangers. Resident Benson Matano said the unknown assailants always torture their victims before killing them. On Tuesday, villagers said they will trek to the county commissioner's office in Kwale to present their grievances. "We are losing innocent souls everyday and nothing has been done," Matano said. Kwale county commissioner Ngumo Karuku yesterday said he has not received any reports about the attacks. He, however, assured residents of safety, saying they will hunt and arrest the criminals. "I'm thankful for sharing this information with me, I will follow it up with the concerned security officers and take action," Karuku said. Villagers at Rombo have also complained of the attacks by unknown gang. Resident Said Mchar said a man was found dead. He had panga injuries. Mcharo said the deceased was heard screaming on Monday night at 9pm and after a few minutes, he was found lying lifeless. Police said they have launched investigations over the attacks and the criminals will be dealt with.
