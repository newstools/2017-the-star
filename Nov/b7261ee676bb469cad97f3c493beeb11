Kenya lawn tennis youth ace Sneha Kotecha secured a place in the 2017 XXXI Yucatan Cup set for between today and November 25 in Mexico. The 2016 Africa 14 and Under Masters girls’ champion, who is ranked 519th in the International Tennis Federation Junior rankings eliminated Mexican Gomez Pezuela Cano ranked 2329. After being awarded a bye in the opening round of the main draw qualifiers, Sneha hit Pezuela in straight sets of 6-2 and 6-0 to advance to the main draw of the 31st edition of the event. The face-off lasted for 90 minutes. This feat placed her sixth among the 24 junior players who were vying for places in the main draw. Only 12 qualified to the main event that draws participants of ages 13 to 18. Sneha’s older brother, ITF Junior ranked 186th Sheil Kotecha will also be competing in the showpiece in the boys’ main draw. Meanwhile, the ITF East Africa Junior Circuit 18 & Under serves off today at the Nairobi Club. The event is set to run for three weeks until December 9. But Sheil, who won last year’s week one show, has been locked out of these competitions by his ITF Junior ranking. His ranking is at a point where playing a Grade Four or Five event does not help his moving upwards in world placement. However, Sneha will play in week two face-offs after she returns from Mexico. The boys’ main draw has attracted 48 players and the qualifier has also fetched the same number of competitors, while the doubles have 24 pairs. The girl’s has class has 32 players in the singles and 16 teams in doubles.
