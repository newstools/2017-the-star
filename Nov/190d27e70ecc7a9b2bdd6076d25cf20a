Fans have angrily reacted to Robert Mugabe's son Chatunga Bellamine on social media after he said his father can never be sacked. Zimbabweans reacted angrily to the post. Summer Rose wrote, "Your father tried to run our country like a corner shop. Zimbabwe is not a family business you don't own it! And what do you mean you can't fire a revolutionary leader? Yes they can and so they did! It seems the whole family needs anti psychotic medication! Mental illness is hereditary." Terry Werry added, "This young n*gga doesn't know the price of a loaf of bread. I respect your Pap's too much but he has failed everyone it's high time he has to go." RealTipsy F Charddonny also gave his two cents saying, "N*gga don't you have money to be spending. Please shut op,. Angry birds out here." Â
