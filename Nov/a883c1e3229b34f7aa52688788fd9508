Residents of Kwale are up in arms against a requirement that they produce their voters cards before being considered for county’s bursary. Only those registered as voters in Kwale were being considered for bursaries, prior to the August 8 general election. But county executive for Education Mangale Chiforondo (pictured) denied that applicants must produce their voters cards for consideration. “We require only the national ID card which is presented to the bursary committee together with the application form alongside other documents,” Chiforondo said. The committee uses the ID card to confirm if they are from the county before one qualifies for funding. Sources at the department said the card requirement was included to help get rid of those not residing in the county. “It is true the voter’s card is required,” the source said. College student Mwanaharusi Hamisi told the Star that his application for bursary was disqualified because he failed to attach his voter’s card. “I really needed the bursary to pay for my fees but i missed,” Hamisi said. Racheal Dena, a parent from Golini, said the fund has been politicised. “Leaders are now using the kitty for political reasons. The voter’s card was not required before,” Dena said. Tiwi resident Amina Rezi said the requirement has locked out children whose parents are not registered as voters. They asked the bursary committee to reconsider the requirement.
