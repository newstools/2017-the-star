We congratulate President Uhuru Kenyatta for his Inauguration today for a second and final term. We also commend him for seeking to return the country to normal by reaching out to the opposition on a political horse-trading basis, whether NASA likes it or not. The 12th General Election and its two presidential polls formed the longest electoral cycle in Kenyan history and the most expensive. The economy took a beating and Kenyans need to get back to work and on the road to prosperity. The country became more divided than ever and the word “secession” gained unprecedented currency. President Uhuru has a gigantic task ahead of him beginning today when it comes to uniting the country and reviving the economy. Unity is everything and hardliners on all sides are only good at feathering their own nests. Exclusion is a national security and economic sabotage threat. How to consolidate unity, reboot the economy and cultivate inclusiveness will be Kenya’s biggest challenges over the next five years.  Former Prime Minister Raila Odinga needs to play his part too.
