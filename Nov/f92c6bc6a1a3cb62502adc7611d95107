Team Mafisi has officially been registered as a foundation that will fight HIV/AIDS and its founder Jaymo Ule Msee has the certificate. Jaymo, whose real name is Wilson Murania, received the certificate from NGOs coordination board chairman Fazul Mahamed on Friday. He said the group will eventually create a platform for members to engage in socio-economic empowerment programmes. "We will link members with donors to support their advocacy work on empowerment projects targeting the youth and women," he said. He added they will steer cohesion and nurture talent throughout the country. The group was initially created as a forum for people with an appetite for more than their spouses and partners.  Its main aim was to warn such men against targeting women in relationships.
