Award-winning style blogger and influencer Nancie Mwai is a force
to reckon with. She is one of the most beloved public figures in Kenya.
Her YouTube channel is a perfect example, as
her adoring fans shower her with endless compliments because of her
superb work. The USIU alumnus has had major highlights this year,
including being featured on US women's beauty publication Allure and
having major brand endorsement deals.  Speaking to Word Is, she shared a few tidbits that her fans did
not know about her. The most striking thing was, of course, how her
pregnancy changed her life. Her daughter is now three years old. Nancie
is a woman of few words, but her striking persona is something that
makes her easily memorable.  When we asked her what is the biggest highlight of her career, she said, "Getting pregnant. It changed my perspective on what I do and
how I do it. I took a long break that made me find love in doing YouTube
videos, sharing my love for fashion and makeup and connecting with
people." Many people may think that bloggers don't earn from blogs, but Nancie begs to differ. "Blogging does pay the bills. However, the current shaky economy is affecting everyone," she said. Nancie is known for keeping her family off social media. In fact, many have mistaken her for being single. When asked why she chose that path, she said, "This this my job and I chose this life. I do enjoy it. However, my family did not choose this." She said she is planning to throw a meet-up bash for her fans and followers next year. Â
