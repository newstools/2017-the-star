It is very unfair if National Police Service officers are putting
their lives on the line defending Kenya against terrorists only to be denied
their hardship allowances. It is astonishing that the multi-agency police officers of
the Boni Forest security operation – The Boni Enclave Campaign – have not been
paid their allowances. They now speak of “untold suffering” as their bosses
have pocketed their allowances. It is a terrible thing for your country to cheat on you in
this manner. Riot police are paid their allowances the same evening they
disperse, beat and shoot demonstrators. It is a pity that thieves should be at the centre of the
national security establishment and steal the hardship allowances of the General
Service Unit, the Recce Squad, the Anti-Terrorism Police Unit, the Rapid
Response Unit and the Administration Police, among other agencies.  These thieves are sabotaging Kenya’s contribution to the war
on terror by demoralising the best-trained and dedicated officers outside the
KDF. This is a grave crime and the perpetrators should be dealt with
immediately.
