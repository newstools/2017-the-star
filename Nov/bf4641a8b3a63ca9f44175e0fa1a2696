The National Assembly got a reprieve yesterday after the Court of Appeal ruled that only some sections of the Constituency Development Fund Act 2013, are unconstitutional. The entire CDF Act was declared unconstitutional in 2015. A three-judge bench consisting of Erastus Githinji, Hannah Okwengu and GBM Kariuki yesterday ruled that sections 24( 3 )(c) 24 ( 3 )(f) and section 37 ( 1 ) (a) of the CDF Act violate the principle of separation of powers. But on the question of whether the entire CDF Act is unconstitutional for violation of the doctrine of separation of powers, the judges said the remaining provisions of the Act still give effect to the main objective of the Act and are implementable and fully operational as a law. “The appeal is allowed to the extent that the declaration that the Constituencies Development Fund Act 2013 is unconstitutional in its entirety and invalid, is set aside and a declaration is hereby made that sections 24( 3 ) (C), 24( 3 ) f) and 37( 1 ) (a) of the CDF Act 2013 are unconstitutional and invalid for violating the principles of separation of powers and are hereby struck down from the CDF Act,” ruled the judges. They were of the view that, contrary to the finding of the High Court in 2015, the CDF Amendment Bill was passed in accordance with the Constitution. They explained that the CDF Act does not violate the principles of the Public Finance division of revenue and division of powers and functions. “Those provisions are severable from the other valid provisions of the Act,” they said. The Institute for Social Accountability and the Centre for Enhancing Democracy and Good Governance filed a petition at the High Court challenging the constitutionality of the CDF Amendment Act, 2013.
