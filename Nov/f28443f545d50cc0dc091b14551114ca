A NCIC commissioner has said the NASA calls for boycott of some products was in order as long as they don't breach the law. Gitile Naituli told journalists in Busia on Tuesday that people have a right to express their views using any channels and methods. He spoke on the sidelines of the County Peace and Cohesion Forum. "Kenya is a unitary state where people are allowed to perfect there democracy as long as they remain peaceful and operate within the law." "Such lawful actions does not mean Kenyans are divided. Some people like panicking because of our political differences to portray the country is divided," he said.  Prof Naituli said NCIC has started the journey of healing and reconciliation across the country after the polarised elections. "In my opinion, the religious community failed to execute its mandate. They are supposed to be moral campus of the society. Their fear of division due to the NASA boycott is unfounded," he added.  He expressed optimism that the division will not widen but will be narrowed as time goes. "Political differences should not be construed to mean there is sharp division in the country," he said.  Prof Naituli lauded the prevailing peace in Busia county.  "This good example should be emulated by other counties so that we live in peace, unity and as one family," he said. He blamed leaders for the perpetual divisions every five years and urged them to get over the same. "Leaders are after satisfying their personal ego. I want to see them have capacity to feel the pain of other Kenyans and bring them together." NCIC started the County Peace and Cohesion Forums in Busia by meeting women leaders and groups.  They will meet the youths on Wednesday and community leaders on Thursday.
