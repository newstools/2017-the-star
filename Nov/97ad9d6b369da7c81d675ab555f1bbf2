IDPs in the Katsaka Kairu camp in Witu, Lamu county, have complained bedbugs and Nairobi flies have invaded the camp, making them have sleepless nights. The national government this week ordered the IDPs to return to their villages, adding that security has been restored. No one has left the camp yet. The 2,000 IDPs from Maleli, Kakathe, Boramoyo, Taa, Nyongoro, Jima, Pandanguo and Poromoko villages said they would rather deal with the hardships in the camp than go back to their homes and start life afresh. They want to be compensated for the revenue lost for the four months they have been in the camps. Speaking at the camp on Thursday, the IDPs said the insects have made life unbearable. Some have contracted skin diseases.
