Candidates in Kitutu Chache constituency are engaging in low-key campaigns ahead of the by-election scheduled for November 7. Seven candidates were cleared by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission. They seek to remove Richard Onyonka , who is seeking his third term on the Ford Kenya ticket. The election was not conducted on August 8 following the death of Jubilee Party candidate Leonard Mwamba on July 14 in a road accident at Nyakoe on the Kisii-Kisumu road. Jubilee Party later nominated Anthony Kibagendi to replace Mwamba. Kibagendi defected from ODM after losing the party ticket to Samuel Omwando. He said he was rigged out. The campaigns were overshadowed by the presidential repeat election, which concluded on October 26. “I’m engaging in door-to-door campaigns and maybe do one or two rallies next week,” said Amani’s Justus Mochoge.
