Kenya Universities Staff Union (KUSU) has opposed Education CS Fred Matiang'i's directive stopping the hiring of varsity staff on permanent basis. In a statement on Thursday, Charles Mukhwaya of the union dismissed the order as a 'roadside directive'. The KUSU secretary general added that the CS has no mandate to dictate how universities are run in the country. "He has no mandate, legal or otherwise, to dictate universities on how to run their affairs," Mukhwaya said. "Such a directive will deny universities academic freedom. Let the government withdraw the ill-advised directive." He further said the ministerial order will 'casualise' the institutions, leading to massive brain drain and high turnover of qualified staff. "The directive will worsen the poor working conditions that already exist in universities and eventually compromise the quality of education." Matiang'i on Wednesday asked the management of all public universities to cease hiring staff on permanent and pensionable basis. He said the order must be implemented starting January 2018 adding that the government can no longer sustain their incomes. "Any university staff should be employed on contract basis," the CS said.  He said the ministry will initiate a clean-up in all public universities that have inherited employees of previous administrations. The CS, however, said that those who have already been employed will not be affected by the new regulation. Read: Lecturers to be hired on contract basis from January - Matiang'i
