Citizen TV's Lillian Muli has been a victim of cyberbullying for quite a while now.  She has been criticised and insulted, but this has not deterred her from doing what she loves most. She has forged ahead and used everything that has been thrown at her as a stepping stone to greater things.  The sexy TV screen siren is indeed a strong woman. Lillian was a guest on Robert Burale's show (RBLiveShow), where she revealed that she has learnt to ignore trolls and focus on the positive things in life. "I have learnt not to take things to heart. Not to look at the world as a negative place. When people attack you, most of the time they are probably going through their own struggles and that's why they choose to attack you. I don't have a thick skin. Just like any other person, my heart bleeds as well. I have very low moments but I have learnt to keep myself busy and try to focus on positive things in life." The popular media personality also revealed that she is a prayerful woman, something many of us didn't know. "I pray a lot. I have a personal relationship with God. Prayer has done wonders in my life," she said. When asked about her regrets, Lillian opened up and she said, "I have made countless mistakes, but now I'm very careful so that I don't repeat [them]. Trusting too much, surrounded by the wrong people, not able to tell real friends from fake [ones]. Sharing personal information with friends who later talk behind your back and criticise you." Many lies have been said about Lillian. For instance, that she relies on sponsors to foot her bills. "The most painful and humiliating thing I have ever heard or seen on social media is that 'Lillian lives a certain lifestyle because it has been given to her by a certain class of people'. We work hard and have side hustles. I have worked hard for everything that belongs to me and my son. So when people spin this narrative, it does get to you, but again at the end of the day, I know who I am."
