Nominated Senator Gertrude Inima has urged the government to honour and respect the rights of women living with disability. She said women living with disability have been left out of government positions and appointments, which leaves them sidelined and discriminated against. Inima added that if in normal circumstances women are discriminated against, then women with disability suffer more. “We want women living with disability to have a voice, to be heard. Many people are unaware that disabled women can contribute to development if they are given a voice and support,” she said. Inima is an ODM nominated senator representing people living with disability. She spoke to the Star on Thursday in Kakamega town, during an event organised by the United Disabled Persons of Kenya at the launch of a programme to help disabled women start businesses. The senator said disabled women are vital to the growth of the economy. “Gone are the days when disabled persons were regarded as a burden. Those who still think so are living in the past. Give us a voice and support and you will see how we can change the economy of this country.” The United Disabled Persons of Kenya will spend Sh120 million to help women living with disability to start businesses. The organisation has launched the project in Nairobi, Kakamega, Laikipia, Taita Taveta and Machakos counties. Speaking at the programme launch in Kakamega town, chairman Joseph Rono said they want to economically empower the disabled. “Economic empowerment of the disabled and their integration in mainstream income-generation activities is essential for an inclusive society. We do not want them to be a burden to the community,” Rono said. The organisation also offers grants to women with disability.
