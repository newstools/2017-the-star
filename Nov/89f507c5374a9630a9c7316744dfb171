Regular readers of this column will know that I never bother to look at the comments online, supposedly made in response to something I had written. This is largely because any assessment of these comments usually reveals the same thing: A tiny fraction of the website’s total online readership bitterly flinging insults at each other, often with no reference at all to what was written by the columnist. But I have friends who do read them, and will often send to me the comments they think I should see. Thus was I made aware that when I wrote about a fortnight ago that Kenyan ethnic political rivalries are nowhere near as toxic as global news media currently suggest, a commentator observed, “You are deluded and naÃ¯ve. The hatred is real. Just wait and see.” What I found disturbing about this comment was that I had on a couple of occasions previously been stunned to realise that I had completely missed out on the intense undercurrents of resentment that some Kenyans feel towards President Uhuru Kenyatta and his government. The first shock was when on a visit to the Coast late last year I took a taxi from the airport in Mombasa to the town centre. The driver was someone who knew me, and so engaged me in a political discussion. He wanted to know what I thought about a remark made a while back by Uhuru, “Kumeza mate sio kula nyama” (“Swallowing saliva is not the same thing as eating meat”). This remark had been alleged by opposition leaders at the time to be an admission that the Uhuru government was one in which certain parts of the country would be left to languish in poverty, ie, swallowing saliva in vain. While others would inhabit the land of milk and honey, ie, eating meat. Now, with almost 20 years of media commentary under my belt, I am accustomed to the likes of Kenyan taxi drivers taking anything I say about politics as gospel. So, when I laughingly told my driver that this remark had really been just the kind of careless words that politicians will utter from time to time, and that the opposition had cleverly quoted the President out of context. I was astonished to see him explode in fury. He had apparently taken the President’s remark as a personal insult. Spluttering as he spoke, he reminded me of the decades of deliberate marginalisation that the Coast had been subjected to; the complete absence of any viable smallholder cash crop economy in the entire region; the failure to revive the cashew nuts factory in Kilifi and so on and on and on. Now I knew all these things, and had indeed often written about the systematic neglect of the Coast by the Nairobi central governments over the decades. But here is the crucial thing: I had not felt personally outraged at this, even though I had lived at the Coast most of my life. I had a detached awareness of the economic stagnation arising from this cruel neglect, but I did not feel personally humiliated and diminished by it. I was reminded of a time when I lived in Boston about a decade ago and in an animated discussion with a group of mostly African-Americans, I carelessly made the confession that I’d had no personal experience of racism in the US. And that whenever I needed help with directions, I invariably asked the nearest policeman for guidance — and had always found them to be most courteous and obliging. This was years before #BlackLivesMatter brought the often-lethal police brutality against African-Americans to global attention. But as you can no doubt guess, my African-American friends — in whose eyes, I was ignorantly defending a deeply malignant and oppressive police force —were outraged. One of them never spoke to me again. Next week I will go into why the deliberate optimism I have always had about Kenya’s long-term prospects may well have been as deluded as my views of 10 years ago on the basic decency of American policemen.
