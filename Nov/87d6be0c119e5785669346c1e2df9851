Garissa Livestock executive Issa Yarrow has promised to revamp the sector, which is a source of livelihood for 98 per cent of the residents. Speaking to the press on Saturday after taking office, Issa said he will develop a five-year action plan. He said his ministry will develop a livestock policy that will be debated by the county assembly and ratified by the Cabinet. “The livestock sector is the backbone of the county. We need an Act that will protect all we intend to do. We also don’t want to do things that may be challenged in law,” Issa said. His priorities include building markets in all six subcounties and forming cooperative societies for farmers. Issa said his ministry will establish a dairy milk processing plant to help farmers package their products. “Currently our livestock farmers sell their milk haphazardly,” he said.
