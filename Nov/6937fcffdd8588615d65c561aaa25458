Parents have been urged to ensure they supervise and advise their children accordingly during the long December holidays. Gladys Chania, a Thika psychologist, said most children are vulnerable to societal ills if not well taken care of. Speaking at her Thika office on Saturday, she said the upsurge of betting and gaming machines is worrying. It has attracted many school-going children. “It’s at these betting and gaming places that the children, especially the teenagers, are introduced to alcohol and drugs and other immoralities. Parents must ensure their children are under their watch for the sake of their education and future,” Chania said. She urged county governments and the local administration to crack down on illegal betting and gaming joints, saying they have become a risk to underage children in society.
