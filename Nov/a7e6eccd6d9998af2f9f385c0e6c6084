A children’s officer in Bunyala subcounty in Budalang’i has said stern action will be taken against parents who force their children to engage in child labour. Speaking to the Star at Bunyala subcounty headquarters yesterday, Jack Okunyi said many parents in rice growing zones allow their children to work as casual labourers in rice fields even on school days. He said Ruambwa-Mudembi and Magombe Irrigation Schemes have become notorious for child labour. He said the department and chiefs will launch a crackdown in the area to bring to book parents who allow their children to work in rice fields at the expense of their education. Okunyi urged parents to educate their children, especially their daughters on the dangers of engaging in sex at an early age.
