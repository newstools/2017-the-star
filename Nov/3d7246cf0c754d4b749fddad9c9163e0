Bungoma MCAs on Tuesday fought moments after the House passed the People’s Assembly motion. The opposition has the majority in the House. The motion was tabled by majority leader Florence Wekesa, who is also the Maeni MCA. Jubilee MCAs walked out of the chamber in protest immediately the motion was passed. Their NASA counterparts followed them and started taunting them as they tried to address the press. The Jubilee MCAs, led by South Bukusu MCA Sudi Busolo, responded by singing circumcision songs. This angered the NASA members, who charged at them. It is a taboo in Bukusu culture to sing circumcision songs to a circumcised man. Security personnel and assembly staff broke the two groups apart. Moving the motion, Wekesa said the People’s Assembly will put the country on the right track. She said independent institutions are under threat. “Constitutional commissions, including the IEBC, National Police Service, the Public Service Commission, the National intelligence Service and National Cohesion and Integration Commission will be protected,” Wekesa said.  She said Kenyans have no option but to have a People’s Assembly to liberate themselves. Mbakalu MCA Bethwel Mwambu of Jubilee opposed it, saying it was a waste of time. “Instead of coming here to represent our people you want us to waste time discussing this document which can’t assist the common mwananchi,” he said.  Deputy speaker Wamusai Simiyu said, “This house and its membership will participate in the proceedings of the People’s Assembly. “[It] will constitute a special college for the appointment or election of members, delegations and observers to the People’s Assembly.”
