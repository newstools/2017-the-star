Former champions Butali Sugar Warriors launch their Kenya Hockey Union Premier League second leg campaign with two matches at the City Park Stadium this weekend. The 2015 champions have a date with second-placed Greensharks today before crossing swords with Nakuru Hockey Club tomorrow. Butali, who blew hot and cold in the first leg, will hope to begin the second leg on a high, well aware of the margin between them and run-away leaders Kenya Police. Butali, coached by Godfrey Wakachunga, interestingly, are placed third with 33 points from 14 matches, while their opponents in today’s tie have 34 from 18. Nakuru, who occupy position 10, have played three more matches to amass 18 points. As to whether the above development will be a motivation to the Western-based outfit to perform well, remains to be seen. Other men’s Premier League matches today will see on-form Kenya Police seek to extend their unbeaten run with a match against Kenya College of Accountancy University (KCAU), before Kenyatta University play hosts to Nakuru. In the only women’s Premier League clash of the day, Chase Amira battle Mombasa Sports Club as they seek to complete a double against their opponents. Amira coach Lynette Onyango said they are aware that the coastal outfit will be out for revenge having beaten them 3-1 in the first leg. Onyango said: “I cannot say much about tomorrow’s (today) game, but what I know is that we have prepared well and are set for the tie. They might come with expectations of vengeance in regards to the previous match but we have our work well cut out and we will be going for a win.”
