A 68-year-old disabled woman died on Tuesday evening when she was struck by a speeding car. The driver didn’t stop. Margret Wacheke was crossing the Nairobi-Nakuru highway at Ha Mathore area in Lari constituency. She was carrying her 3-year-old grandson on her back when she was knocked down. The boy was thrown into a ditch.   Witnesses said the driver didn’t stop to check on their condition but sped off. He was however arrested and taken to police station after boda boda operators at Nyambare trading center were called to block the highway. “We blocked the way and the driver tried to swerve inside a petrol station, but we blocked him completely until he stopped,” rider Francis Gicheru said.
