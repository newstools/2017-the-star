A flood alert has been issued in
Tana River county following heavy rainfall in Mt Kenya which is source of most rivers flowing through the county. Kenya Red Cross told residents
to begin preparing to move to safer grounds in case floods strike. Jerald Bombe, KRCS manager in charge
of Tana River and Kitui counties, said there are
indications the area will experience floods. He spoke at Rhoka dispensary in Galole
constituency during the launch of ‘Catch Up’ primary health care campaign. He said there may also be floods in the
lowlands if it rains in Mt Kenya and Ukambani areas. "Floods in Tana River county are usually
a result of water from the upstream Seven Folks Dams." "We are prepared to deal with emergencies in case the disaster occurs," Bombe said on Friday. He said action teams comprising of 20 volunteers in each of the county's three sub-counties have been trained to handle such
emergencies.
