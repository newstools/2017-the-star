The Kenya Tea Development Agency is seeking new tea markets in the Middle East countries. Agency board chairman Peter Kanyago said they will soon go to the far East countries to expand market for the produce targeting countries such as Philippines and Malaysia. He also termed this year's tea bonus good compared to last year's. Kanyago said the prices of tea have been fairly good in the last four months and expressed optimism that this will be sustained going forward. He said the weather is currently favourable for tea production. "Farmers should take advantage of the good weather and have a good crop so that by the end of the year, they can receive better bonus," the chairman said. Â  Kanyago spoke during the Iria-ini Tea Factory AGM at the factory grounds on Friday. On Gura Hydro Power project, the chairman said the project is producing a maximum capacity of 5.8MW. The average production is 5.5MW. "At times, we are generating even 6MW. Our consumption is only 2MW and we are selling the excess to the national grid," Kanyago said. Other tea factories benefitting from the hydro power project other Gathuthi, Gitugi and Chinga.
