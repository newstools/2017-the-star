Over 50 people are being treated at Sagana Subcounty Hospital in Kirinyaga with cholera-like symptoms. Rose Wangui, a clinical officer at the hospital, said yesterday there is an outbreak of the disease in Kwa V slums. Many of the patients have severe diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal cramps and dehydration, she said.  Wangui said the patients are from the same village and must have taken untreated water or eaten contaminated food.. The hospital has done tests on the patients and sent them to the Government Chemist. Wangui said six patients were recuperating at Sagana Subcounty Hospital, three are at Kerugoya County Hospital and two are admitted to Kimbimbi Sub-County Hospital.  Twenty counties have been affected by cholera – a total of 3,518 cases with 66 deaths. Seven counties have active outbreaks; Nairobi, Kajiado,Garissa and Embu, Kirinyaga, Murang’a and Turkana, according to Relief Web. Public health officers are educating the public on the disease and will also disinfect Kwa V slums. Residents have been urged to boil drinking water. Food hawking, feeding at burials, weddings and other social gatherings has been banned in Kirinyaga. Health officials suspect the heavy rains in Kirinyaga have contaminated water. Sagana Hospital is giving residents free aqua tabs for treating water. Kirinyaga Health executive Agnes Wanjiru told the Star on the phone yesterday roadside eateries have not been closed since the outbreak is as a result of contaminated water in the slum.
