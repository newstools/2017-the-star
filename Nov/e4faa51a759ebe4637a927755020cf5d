The Administration Police post at the Red Cross Society camp in Kirathimo on the outskirts of Limuru town has been closed. This follows a letter by the RCS to the deputy inspector general in charge of AP, Samuel Arachi, asking him to relocate the officers since they wanted the houses they occupy. Area deputy county commissioner David Kiprop confirmed the facility is owned by the RCS, but the officers found themselves at the facility when they were posted there during the 2007-08 post-election violence. “The IDPs who were hosted there needed security. They were so many, even though I wasn’t the administrator. They have been operating at the post since then. It is almost 10 years, now the RCS is demanding the houses back,” Kiprop said. AP commander Gitonga Gathumi yesterday said all officers moved out of the camp last week.
