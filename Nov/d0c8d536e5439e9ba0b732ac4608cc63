A requiem mass in honour of Captain Apollo Malowa was held on Thursday at Our Lady of Peace Catholic Church in South B, Nairobi. Malowa died on October 21 in a helicopter crash in Lake Nakuru. The mass was attended by family members, friends, workmates and former servicemen in the Kenya Airforce. Malowa was eulogised as a generous, caring and fun-loving young man with a big heart. His mother Mama Dorothy said the loss of her son “felt like God had taken a big eraser and cleaned the chalkboard of my dreams”. Malowa was buried on Saturday at his parent’s home in Olago-Kamkwaya village, Bondo, Siaya county.
