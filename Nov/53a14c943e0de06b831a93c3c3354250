Finally, after much talk and promises, the county government and the ministry of Water say they are close to drilling 85 boreholes for Sh340 million. It is still not known when drilling will begin.The date is still not known.  One will be drilled in each of the 85 wards and serve as an emergency water source when there is rationing. “Our main source remains surface water but because of the unpredictable weather,  as we wait for projects to be completed, we need emergency measures,” NCWSC managing director Nahashon Muguna said. Each borehole will cost Sh4 million. In a separate project, the county and state started drilling 40 boreholes for Sh200 million in April when the shortage was acute. Yesterday, Muguna said only 14 of the 40 have been drilled. Twenty-four others are to be operational in two months, he said. Boreholes have been sunk at Kenyatta University, Kibera Primary School, Joseph Kangethe, Gikomba, Makongeni and other areas. Maguna said. Before the April project, NCWSC had 74 boreholes, in addition to privately owned wells. Eighteen have dried up or malfunctioned. There have been concerns that the many boreholes will seriously reduce the water table. “The boreholes are only for emergency, that is why we are not worried,” Muguna said. The MD said the water problem could be permanently resolved by 2020. That’s the expected completion year of the Northern Water Tunnel project from Murang’a and two other dams under construction. The Murang’a tunnels will provide at least 140 million cubic metres to the city per day. An additional 100 million litres of water will be supplied after completion of Karimeni 2 and Ruiru 2 dams.
