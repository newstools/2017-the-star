Two brothers were tortured and shot dead on Wednesday night after gangsters raided Chepsogoi village in Mt Elgon. Two other siblings were seriously wounded. The thugs were armed with AK-47 rifles and other weapons. They attacked the homestead of prominent businesman Patrick Muyei’s at midnight and demanded cash. “Upon resisting their demand, they tortured and shot my four sons,” Muyei told the press at his home on Thursday. Those killed are Isaack Muyei and Nahashon Kosum.  Kosum died on the spot.  Muyei said he scuffled with the attackers. He said the gang demanded his sons wake him up and turn over the family cash. Muyei was sleeping in another house. He said the gang tortured his sons before shooting them. Mt Elgon OCPD Peterson Nyakundi said the gang also shot and injured two police officers who were on patrol.  The officers were stationed at Kaptalelio and Kongit police posts. “As they ran away after killing the two brothers, they met two police officers who were on patrol and shot at them,’’ Nyakundi said.  Muyei is a well-known businessman.  Nyakundi dismissed claims the attackers could be members of the Sabaot Land Defence Force. “This was a normal thuggery incident and it has nothing to do with SLDF remnants regrouping,” Nyakundi said. He told residents not to worry.  Nyakundi said they are investigating and will arrest the killers. The injured officers were admitted at Lugulu Mission Hospital, while the two brothers were admitted to Kaptola Hospital. Nyakundi said security will be strengthend. He appealed to residents with information on any suspected gang member to volunteer it to the police. There have been many cases of gangs attacking businessmen, politicians and residents in Mt Elgon.  No arrests had been made this year. Residents have called for the transfer of police officers who have stayed in local stations for too long. They claimed the officers are accomplices of the gangs that terrorise residents.
