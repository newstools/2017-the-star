Former Embu Senator Lenny Kivuti’s lawyers in the petition challenging the election of Governor Martin Wambora have expressed fears that the hearing venue for the case is unsafe for them, their clients and the presiding judge.  They want the case transferred to the High Court in Embu.  The lawyers, led by Alfred Nyamu, said the petition “is quite a sensitive matter” that needs to be handled with a lot of security because it touches on the lives of residents. Nyamu said Manyatta Youth Centre, where the petition is being heard, is “quite small and insecure” and not hospitable for residents who are interested to follow proceedings.  The location and the design of the centre are also inappropriate, he added. He told Justice William Musyoka that anything might happen to them.  “Anybody might walk in unexpectedly and wreak havoc and by the time the police respond, he would have run away,” Nyamu said.
