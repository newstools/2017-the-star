Residents of Budalang'i
have been urged to adopt the recently introduced fish cage farming
project. Bunyala subcounty fisheries officer Shadrack Kimani made the appeal while addressing fishermen
at Mulukoba Beach in Port Victoria town after presiding over fish harvesting on Monday. He said the fish cage project funded by Busia County Government will help improve the livelihood of the fishing
community in Budalang'i. Kimani said a new
fish breeding method will also go a long way in putting an end to the
persistent harassment of fishermen by Uganda marine security officers who have
been confiscating their fishing gears and boats. “I want to urge you to take up the
new fish breeding system in large numbers as this will save you from persistent harassment by Uganda marine security
officers,” said the fisheries officer. Kimani added that the fish farming
project will address the current fish shortage in Lake Victoria. “The fish farming project will
address the current fish shortage in Lake Victoria. So we are grateful to Busia
county government for introducing and funding the fish cage project that will
transform the livelihood of the people,’ said the fisheries official
