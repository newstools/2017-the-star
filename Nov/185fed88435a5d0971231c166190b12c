Tension is high between Embu University students and boda bodas after a rider was nearly burnt alive on suspicion of theft.  Police patrols have intensified in Kangaru village to prevent retaliatory attacks after students burnt a motorbike belonging to Jacob Njue. They alleged he was part of a gang that snatches students’ laptops and mobile phones. Kangaru chief Moses Munyi said on Thursday that around 7pm, scores of students cornered the 25-year-old rider and burnt his bike. They beat Njue, tore off his trousers, set them alight and threw it on him.  He suffered serious burns. Police dispersed the students, rescued the rider and took him to Embu Level Five Teaching and Referral Hospital where he is admitted. Munyi said the attack occurred the same day he, county and state leaders met students and university administrators to try to ease tension. They discussed claims of theft by riders. “I thought things had cooled down. But later in the evening, I was told students attacked a rider as he dropped off a passenger,” Munyi said. The chief said students have been complaining some riders slow down when they approach those carrying laptops or making phone calls. They snatch laptops, phones and speed off. Njue said the students suspected a gang of riders and planned to retaliate. The administrator urged students and the community to live in harmony. He warned those stealing from students to stop. Investigations are underway.  There has been bad blood between the students and the riders for months. In September a student was admitted to hospital after a boda boda reportedly raped her while taking her to university. She was admitted to Embu Teaching and Referral Hospital after being roughed up and attacked.
