Seven suspects accused of violently robbing the late Kabete MP, Geoge Muchai, his two bodyguards and a driver along Kenyatta Avenue on February 7, 2015 cannot be supplied with copies of Safaricom data.  Simon Gichamba, Margaret Wachuiri, Raphael Gachii , Kimani Musti and Stephen Asiliva , Erick Muyera and Jane Wanjiru Kamauhave denied robbery with violence charges.  Safaricom lawyer Robert Gitau yesterday informed Milimani chief magistrate Francis Andayi the calls data have other customers’ information. They have nothing to do with the case. He told the court the company has already supplied to the accused persons only part of information.  The court had summoned an officer from the firm to tell it whether it is possible to supply copies of data before the next hearing. But the prosecution opposed the application, saying the data has people’s names who are not party to the case.  The accused are all still in remand until the hearing and determination of the case.They were denied bond.
