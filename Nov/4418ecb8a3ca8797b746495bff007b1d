At least 112 constituencies are likely to miss out on CDF cash for failure to constitute committees to manage the kitty. National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi on Tuesday said that the NG-CDF Board has only received nominees from 178 constituencies. The said board receives monies from the National Treasury for subsequent disbursement to the constituencies. Muturi asked the affected MPs to expedite the nominations of persons to be appointed into various CDF committees. He said the NG-CDF Board has notified all members to commence the nomination of persons to serve in the committees as required by law. "I, therefore, encourage all members to expedite the nominations as requested by the board for approval by the House," he told members. The NG-CDF committee is composed of the county commissioner, two men, two women, and a person with disability. It also has two persons nominated by the constituency office established under the Parliamentary Service Act, an officer of the board seconded to the constituency committee, and one member co-opted by the board. They hold office for a period of two years. Majority Leader Aden Duale told the House that he has told Treasury CS Henry Rotich to release the monies this week. "I have held talks with Rotich to release the money to the board this week. Let the members who are yet to form committees do so as quickly as possible." The August House leaders did not give details of which MPs are yet to constitute the CDF management teams.
