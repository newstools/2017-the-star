The hearing of a burial dispute involving the widow of former Thika mayor Douglas Mundia was put off until Wednesday next week. Priscilla Nyambura, 78, the first wife of Mundia, was to be buried on November 7 in Kang’oo village, Gatundu North constituency, but the burial was stopped after some members of the family obtained a court order objecting to the burial site. The injunction was obtained by son Isaac Munene on behalf of some of the children of the former long-serving mayor, who had four wives and the matter was slotted for hearing before Thika resident magistrate Grace Omodho yesterday. The plaintiffs pleaded for more time to reply to an affidavit. The family is involved in a tussle over property.
