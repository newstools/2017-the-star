The Waterfront Karen, which is set to open its doors to the public in January 2018, has assigned South African retailer Game Stores as its anchor tenant. Game is a promotional driven discount retailer selling predominantly general merchandise consisting of electrical appliances, hi-tech electronic items and camping equipment among others. This will see Game open its second outlet in Kenya. The Waterfront offers over 200,000 square feet of retail galleries and restaurants, outdoor amenities and lake-side activities which will keep the entire family entertained. The mall boasts of several key offerings that will appeal to visitors and shoppers. These include a 3.5-acre man-made lake, five acres of landscaped lake front and breathtaking water features as well as a safe, dedicated track for running, walking and cycling. The Waterfront will considerably reduce reliance on main water, lighting and comfort utilities. The buildings will use as much natural light as possible and take advantage of natural ventilation as far as possible. To keep its tenants, their assets and customers secure, the Waterfront has designed a security strategy that complies with world standards, providing several layers of protection. The building positioning ensures a sufficient setback distance from potential threats.
