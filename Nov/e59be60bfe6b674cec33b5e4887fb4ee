Defence lawyers in a case challenging the reelection of Homa Bay Governor Cyprian Awiti on Thursday dismissed the affidavits presented by the petitioners. Lawyers Frederick Orego for the IEBC and Steve Biko for Awiti thwarted affidavit Forms 37A filed by former governor hopeful Oyugi Magwanga in the court. Magwanga, the former Kasipul legislator, and his running mate Joshua Orero are challenging the reelection of Awiti and his deputy Hamilton Orata. Magwanga, through his lawyer, Jack Oronga, claimed there were a number of numerical alterations made on the Forms 37A to match results used in declaring Awiti the winner. Oronga said some forms lacked security features and presiding officers failed to sign them. He cited five polling stations in Homa Bay Town constituency where he said there was a consistent figure in vote difference. Â
