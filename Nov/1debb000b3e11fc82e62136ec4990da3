Nakuru Governor Lee Kinyanjui has asked all Kenyans to embark on reconciliation and peace-building. The Governor noted deliberate steps must be taken to heal the deep wounds created by the protracted political campaigns. Kenya has had two presidential elections - on August 8 and October 26 - and Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila Odinga's camps are still tearing into each other.

"Words and images that seek to entrench hatred and disrespect among citizens must be discouraged," he told journalists in the county on Saturday. Kinyanjui noted the last 12 months have been characterised by intense political rivalry between and within parties. "The judicial processes that led to the appeals at the Supreme Court have divided the country further. While this situation is unfortunate, it is not unusual," he said. The Governor noted all democratic nations experience relative division during campaign periods but that the people move on for the sake of development. He asked Kenyans to realise their greatest asset is unity and keep short term political differences from standing in the way of prosperity. "After Uhuru's inauguration, we shall team up with like-minded Kenyans and preach the gospel of unity. Please join us as we reclaim our position as the land of peace."
