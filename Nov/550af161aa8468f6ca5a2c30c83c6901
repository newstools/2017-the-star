The death toll in Friday’s terror attack on a Sufi mosque in northern Sinai has risen to 305, Egypt's state prosecutor said Saturday. According to a statement from the public prosecutor read out on Egyptian state-run news channel Nile TV, 27 children are among the dead. The statement said another 128 people were wounded in the attack that was carried out by between 25 and 30 armed men on the al Rawdah Sufi mosque in Bir al-Abed. The prosecutor described in the statement how the attack was executed. He said attackers arrived in five SUVs and were armed with automatic machine guns. They had long beards and hair, were wearing military fatigues and were armed with heavy machine guns, the statement said. They took position in front of the mosque and its entrances. A number of attackers, some of them masked, then entered the mosque. Attackers stationed outside shot survivors who scrambled out of the mosque after an explosive ripped through the mosque. Dozens were shot dead by the attackers as they scampered for safety.  According to witnesses, the attackers also ambushed ambulances as they transported survivors to hospital. According to the statement, at least one of those who entered the mosque was carrying an ISIS flag. ISIS or its affiliate in Egypt has however not claimed responsibility. President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi vowed to respond to retaliate to the attacks with brutal force. The military said Saturday that Egyptian warplanes conducted airstrikes on "terrorist outposts" and vehicles following the attack.  Military spokesman Tamer Rifai said in a statement the air attacks also targeted a number of terrorist outposts containing weapons, ammunition and radical elements.
