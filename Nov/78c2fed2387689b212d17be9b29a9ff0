The death of former Changamwe MP Ramadhan Kajembe’s son Seif has robbed the family of his heir apparent. Seif, 45, was being groomed to take over from Kajembe, whose political journey is coming to an end, after more than 30 years in active politics. Seif died at 3am yesterday at a hospital in India where he had been receiving treatment for kidney problems. A good-humoured person, he touched the hearts of many a youth in Jomvu constituency, where his first stab at elective politics in 2013 sparked a domestic feud that almost tore the Kajembe family apart. Seif ran for the ODM ticket to contest the newly formed Jomvu constituency MP seat against his brother-in-law Badi Twalib, who was a councillor representing Jomvu Kuu ward. He clinched the ticket with 2,333 votes against Twalib’s 1,966. Twalib cried foul and quit the Orange party in protest. Considered a rebel in the larger Kajembe family, Twalib flew to Nairobi, got the Wiper ticket, and went on to beat Seif in a hotly contested race. Kajembe lost the Mombasa senator race to Hassan Omar, after the human rights activist also quit ODM in protest and joined Wiper. The Kenya Ferry Service chairman cried foul and blamed his defeat and that of Seif on Governor Hassan Joho, whom he accused of working with Omar behind his back. Kajembe at that time was the ODM national vice chairman and Joho the deputy party leader. The Kajembe family was accused of promoting hereditary politics, with critics saying they want to rule Mombasa West, which comprises Changamwe and Jomvu constituencies, as a kingdom. Jomvu was curved out of Changamwe constituency. Yesterday, Twalib said he and Seif were not enemies. “We were friends even though we were in different political camps. There were no ill feelings. It was only politics. He was not resistant. Ours was pure politics,” he said.
