Glasgow-based Celtic Foundation and kit manufacturer New Balance have donated football jerseys to teams in Nairobi’s Kibera. Betting giants Dafabet, shirt sponsors of Scottish giants Celtic FC, facilitated the event on Saturday bringing to 50, the number of grass root teams in Kibera to have benefited from the initiative dubbed ‘#turudigame.’  The initiative seeks to re-introduce competitive football and talent search in Kenya. The teams were kitted with this season’s Celtic FC jerseys, which commemorates 50 years since Celtic won the European Cup.  The ceremony involved two charity football matches at Olympic Secondary in Kibera which saw Dafabet-sponsored Kibera Celtic beat Lexus 2-1in front of hundreds of fans—their first win over their archrivals in over three years.  Kenya’s popular artiste Nonini Mgenge True and Kenya’s biggest reggae DJ Kriss Darlin graced the event and both took part in a Celebrity penalty shootout between Kibera Celtic and Kibera Legends. Kibera Celtic won 6-5 with the Kriss Darlin, who captained the side, scoring the winner while Nonini led Kibera Legends.
