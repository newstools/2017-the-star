LinkedIn has teamed up with Microsoft to come up with Resume Assistant, that will help Office 365 subscribers craft more compelling resumes with personalized insights powered by LinkedIn. According to LinkedIn blog, Resume Assistant will be rolling out on Windows and will be generally available to Office 365 subscribers in the coming months. Resume Assistant works to craft compeling resumes through pulling down LinkedIn insights from millions of member profiles for the user to see diverse examples of how professionals in that role describe their work. The feature also leverages machine learning to help customers update and improve their resumes directly from within Word—suggesting language or content pulled from the robust LinkedIn network. The jobseekers will also have direct access to job openings from the LinkedIn platform, and can therefore apply directly using their revamped CV. “Along with job openings, you’ll see details of what the job requires, helping you to tailor your resume to a specific role,” LinkedIn said in their blog. The collaboration is backed by the two companies’ unique positions to understand needs of both jobseekers and workers in the modern workplace. LinkedIn is the world’s largest professional network, with more than 530 million users. It connects the world’s employers with job seekers.
