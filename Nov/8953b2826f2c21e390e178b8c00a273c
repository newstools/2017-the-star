The High Court has sentenced Defence PS Saitoti Torome to six months in civil jail after he was found guilty of contempt. Justice Joseph Sergon gave the sentence after Torome failed to obey court orders directing him to pay Sh17,257,930 to a family who gave out their estate to the government in 2006. “The respondents have failed to appear in court and mitigate why he has failed to honour court orders having been cited for civil jail for contempt earlier,” the judge said. Sergon last week said he was to pronounce the sentence not withstanding that the respondents would not be present in court since they did not even send a representative. In the suit, Eunice Makori and Hellen Makone moved to court in 2009 to sue Torome, through Inspector General Joseph Boinnet. They failed to compensate them for the surrender of Johnson Onduko’s land in Mombasa town to the government. Makori and Makone said being the administrator and personal representatives of the estate of Makori, the government failed to pay them Sh9.2 million, plus interest, in 2006, when the land was given to the government. The applicants, mother and daughter, say in June 2015, a judgment was delivered and they were awarded money for compensation. They said the judgment and orders given by the judge were served on Torome, Boinnet and the then Attorney General, Amos Wako, and they acknowledged receipt. The PS filed an affidavit in June saying he is the accounting officer in the ministry and does not owe the applicant any money. He added that he is aware that any liability or expenditure incurred against the government can only be defrayed from moneys provided by Parliament. “Parliament has not provided my ministry with adequate funds to settle the applicant’s claim,” Torome said.
