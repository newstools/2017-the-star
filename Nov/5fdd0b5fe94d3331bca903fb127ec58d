Former Everton player Leon Osman has called on young football players not to peg their ambitions on big time cash but focus on chasing their dreams. Osman, who arrived in the country on Tuesday, was speaking at Ziwani grounds where he interacted with players and organisers of the annual Koth Biro tournament, courtesy of Sportpesa — Everton’s shirt sponsor. He is in the country on a fact finding mission dubbed ‘Kits for Africa campaign,’ an initiative that seeks to rally players and fans of their partners in Africa to donate kits to needy teams in the continent.  He also watched a match between Githurai Allstars and Santos which the former won 2-0. Later, he visited Kariobangi Community grounds, where he met players from the local teams Kariobangi Sports and Korokocho Youth.  “Kits for Africa will be an African-oriented programme but I chose to land in Nairobi first because this, I understand, is where we have the biggest potential, particularly in the slums where most youths are disadvantaged in terms of resources,” said Osman.  He observed that under SportPesa, the programme is in safe hands since they are among top football sponsors in Africa. Osman is expected to visit Kawangware this morning where he will engage with young footballers.
