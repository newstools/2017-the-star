Narok police have killed a suspect in connection to the death of a trader in Duka Moja, Narok East, last week. Police boss Joseph Kisombe yesterday said the suspect was killed on Wednesday night after a tip-off from a member of the public. The killing of the trader sparked protests by residents. They were led by MP Ken Aramat. They blocked the Narok-Mai Mahiu highway for hours. “The locals spotted the armed criminals — four in number — at the Tipis trading centre in Narok North and alerted police, who acted swiftly,” Kisombe said. Two were arrested and are in police custody in Narok. One was was gunned down as he tried to escape.  Kisombe said he had a G3 rifle, which was stolen from the Sakutiek AP post in Narok East on October 19. Police are hunting for the fourth suspect, who escaped. He had a pistol, the officer said.
