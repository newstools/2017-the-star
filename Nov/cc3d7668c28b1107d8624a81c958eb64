  Embu county assembly has censured local churches for contributing to female genital mutilation by failing to speak out against it.  The Gender committee said harmful practice has been going on secretly in parts of the county under the full watch of the church. Led by nominated ward rep Elizabeth Kibai, the committee on Friday asked the church to condemn the vice among its faithful. She spoke after the committee visited two of the four forcibly circumcised at Gichiche village, Mbeere South last week.  Seven girls were rescued by county administratrators after a circumciser who had already operated on the four.   The chairperson of the committee Sicily Warue said the county assembly will soon enact a law to eliminate the cases of circumcision of school girls in the area.
