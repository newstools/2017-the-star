A nominee for an executive position in Homa Bay has declined to take his seat after being approved by the county assembly. Alfonse Wera ,who was endorsed for the Energy post, rejected it and failed to attend the swearing-in on Wednesday last week. Wera declined the position because he lacked experience.  Speaking to kournalists on Friday, Wera said he applied for the position of Trade but he was appointed to serve in a different department. He said he has tendered his letter after declining the position. “Accepting to serve in a department where I lack professional qualification would undermine my integrity and disappoint the people of Homa Bay,” Wera said. The nine who were sworn-in  included Dickson Nyawinda (Water), Nicholas Koriko (Finance), Richard Muga (Health), David Okeyo (Roads), Carelus Ademba (Trade), Beatrice Ogola (Lands), Roselyn Odhiambo (Tourism), Beatrice Asiago (Education) and Aguko Juma (Agriculture).
