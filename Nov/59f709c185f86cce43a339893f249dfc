A truck carrying an armoured personnel carrier caused a scene after it veered off the road a few metres from where Nyeri governor Wahome Gakuru was involved in an accident on Tuesday. Kandara OCPD Gregory Mutiso said the truck slipped and got stuck in mud by the roadside. Mutiso said the truck was heading to Kahawa Barracks from Nanyuki at the time of the accident. The police boss noted that army officers offloaded the armoured vehicle and used it to pull the truck from the mud. The incident that occurred at around 6pm attracted the attention of hundreds of locals who thought it was another accident. The apprehensive locals said the area has become a black spot. They asked the Kenya National Highways Authority to put measures in place to ensure no more accidents occur in the area. The locals said the highway is too slippery which causes vehicles to lose control. Â
