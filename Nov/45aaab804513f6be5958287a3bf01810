The government has set aside Sh200 million to help maize farmers dry their produce to achieve the required moisture content.  According to the Kenya Bureau of Standards, any maize fit for human consumption should have 13.5 per cent moisture content. Agriculture PS Richard Lesiyampe said on Thursday the fund is meant for farmers who do not have adequate capacity to dry their maize. “The government will help in delivering and drying maize at the National Cereals and Produce Board depots at no charge. This is meant to reduce high level of moisture on maize,” he said. But some farmers from the North Rift who talked to the Star said the NCPB is charging them Sh34 per moisture unit per bag. Anthony Kioko from the Cereal Growers Association said maize farmers continue to suffer losses post-harvest due to the unusually wet harvesting season which increases the percentage of rotten grain and increased cost of labour in drying the maize. “Such charges would mean a farmer who delivers maize to the NCPB at 18 per cent moisture content has to pay Sh153 just for drying to reduce it to the required 13.5 per cent. All the above issues, coupled with drought and fall armyworm infestation during the growing season are putting pressure on the maize farmers with many reporting huge losses,” he said.
