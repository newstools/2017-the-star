Former Kanduyi MP Alfred Khang’ati has asked NASA coprincipals Musalia Mudavadi and Moses Wetang’ula to abandon opposition leader Raila Odinga. Khang’ati on Friday said Raila will eventually dump Mudavadi and Wetang’ula, and the two leaders should be ready to quit NASA. He said ditching NASA would give them ample space to champion Luhya unity. Raila is a cunning and selfish politician who only uses leaders to get their votes, Kang’ati said. “Raila told them he was running for the last time in 2017 and that he would support one of them in 2022. But he has changed his mind. He is not ready to retire,” Khang’ati told the Star. He was speaking at his home in Kanduyi. The former assistant minister ditched ODM for Jubilee in August. He ran for Bungoma governor on the ODM ticket in the August 8 election. Many politicalleaders are already abandoning Raila, he said.
