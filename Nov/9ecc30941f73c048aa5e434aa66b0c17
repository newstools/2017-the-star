The Madaraka Express Passenger Service will leave at 7.15am, instead of 8am, starting on December 1. Morning traffic jams in Mombasa have forced the change. Passengers leaving Mombasa for Nairobi must be at Miritini Station by 6.45am for 7.15am departure. Previously, departure was at 8am. Many passengers missed the train because of heavy traffic in Changamwe. “To beat heavy traffic, which usually begins around 7.30am, KRC revised the departure time from Mombasa,” MD Atanas Maina (pictured) said. “We only have one road to Miritini Station. The 8am departure time became a nightmare for many passengers because of the traffic,” Maina said. He spoke to journalists on Monday on the sidelines of a media workshop organised by the Kenya Ports Authority at the Whitesands Hotel.
