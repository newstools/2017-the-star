NASA leaders have vowed to sue the National Police Service and the Inspector General of Police for the killing of innocent civilians during the disputed repeat presidential election. They made the announcement on Saturday in Mulau village, Mwala Constituency during the burial of 15-year-old Joseph Kaloki, who was shot dead by police on October 26, on the Jua Kali estate in Athi River. Mavoko MP Patrick Makau and Machakos woman rep Joyce Kamene have promised to present a case in court to seek justice for the victims. The leaders said governments are supposed to protect their citizens and not kill them. Kaloki had been sent to the shop by his mother when a bullet hit him. Makau said NASA leaders will hold a requiem service for its fallen members in Athi River. Â
