Matatu drivers in the five counties that form the proposed Nairobi Metropolitan Transport Area will have to undertake special training and examination if a Bill before Parliament is passed. The Nairobi Metropolitan Area Transport Authority Bill, which was introduced in the National Assembly yesterday, proposes that in addition to the usual national PSV driver’s licences, drivers will have to be awarded a certificate of professional competence. The Bill is sponsored by the state, through National Assembly Majority leader Aden Duale. It will apply to drivers in Nairobi, Kajiado, Kiambu, Machakos and Murang’a counties. It says the competence certificate shall be valid for a period of five years and will only be awarded to persons of good health. The Bill will also create the Nairobi Metropolitan Area Transport Authority to oversee the establishment of an integrated, efficient, effective and sustainable transport system for the five counties. “The Authority shall specify, monitor and facilitate driver and operator competency training to be carried out by others for the public service vehicles within the metropolitan area,” it says. Transport operators within the metropolitan area will have to be of good reputation and financial standing, and satisfy the requirements of professional competence. The Bill will also proposes formation of the Nairobi Metropolitan Area Council — the apex body to be chaired by the Transport Cabinet Secretary. Other members of the council will include the Treasury CS, county governors and a director general. The Nairobi governor will be the deputy chair of the council. The council will determine the financial contributions of each county and approve the master and strategic plans and declare the transport corridors. The NMTA will also have a board.
