The bodies of a woman and her daughter on Monday were found dumped in Bidii Farm in Kwanza subcounty, Trans Nzoia county.  The body of Noel Mulongo's, 30, was dumped on the farm, while that of her nine-year-old daughter Nancy was in a fishpond 500 meters away. Noel's husband was away harvesting his maize crop, Kwanza OCPD Wilfred Mogere. "Our officers received the information yesterday night that there was a woman's body dumped in a farm," he said. Mogere said they have launched investigations. He said Noel's body had marks on the neck suggesting she was strangled. Neighbour Monicah Barasa yesterday said they heard Noel's six-month baby cry only to find out she was not at home. "I told my children to play with the baby as we wait for her mother to return, but two hours later the mother had not showed up," she said.
