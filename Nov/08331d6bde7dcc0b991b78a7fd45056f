Kapenguria MP Samuel Moroto (pictured) wants the Jubilee administration to apologise for the killing by police of livestock in Laikipia while flushing out herders from private ranches.  He said yesterday the government acted wrongly and should pay for the shooting of 300 animals in a gunbattle. Police say only 75 animals were killed.  “I’m in Jubilee and if the government does not seek forgiveness and repent the killings, we will see worse things because our communities value and respect livestock. We hold animals at heart and it’s not a joke,” the visibly agitated Moroto said in Eldoret during a mass for the late Catholic Bishop Cornelius Korir. He said it was not possible for herders to hide among animals and use them as shields. No herder was killed.  “It’s not fair for police to kill animals, which cannot talk for themselves. It’s not acceptable,” Moroto said. He also wants IG Joseph Boinnet to apologise.
