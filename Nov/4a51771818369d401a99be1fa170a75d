 Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen has urged politicians to be peacemakers and avoid bitter power struggles. He urged politicians to emulate the late Bishop Cornelius Korir. Murkomen said Kenya needs peacemakers to help resolve the political rift that threatens stability. “Sometimes I ask myself why do we struggle or fight for power so much, forgetting that one day we will lie dead heading back to the maker or creator,” Murkomen said. He spoke during the funeral of Korir in Eldoret on Saturday. Murkomen said leaders should work towards leaving a good legacy instead of engaging in power struggles. “I want to assure everyone that as leaders we will be peacemakers in honour of the bishop. We will work to unite Kenyans,” he said.
