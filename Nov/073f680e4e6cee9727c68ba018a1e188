Prof Isaac Kosgey has emerged top for the second time in interviews to pick a new Vice Chancellor for Moi University. This comes amid bribery claims and fresh controversy over ethnic boardroom wars over the position. University Council chairman Dr Jeremiah Ntoloi declined to comment.  The results were forwarded to Education CS Fred Matiang’i. The interviews were done on Monday. Kosgey, who has been the Deputy Vice Chancellor at Laikipia University scored 76 marks, acting VC Prof Laban Ayiro got 70 marks, same as Prof Ann Nangulu. Prof Maurice Amutabi scored 66 marks, Prof Isaac Kibwage got 64 marks and Prof Joseph Chacha got 61 marks. “We’re wondering how three members of the panel gave high marks to one candidate, yet another one who has shown ability to transform the university was awarded low marks,”a council member, who declined to be named, said.  In September last year, Matiang’i cancelled results of interviews at the university in which Kosgey topped. Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago and Elgeyo Marakwet Alex Tolgos lead protests. But DP Ruto defended Matiang’i.
