Famed painter Michael Soi recently held an exhibition called ‘Sex & The City III’ alongside fellow artist Thom Ongong’a at Alliance Francaise Nairobi from November 6-12.  This was the third series in the showcasing, the first and second installation having taken place in 2014 and 2015 to quite a bit of controversy and calls for a shutdown. Taking in his bold and vibrant collection at Alliance’s gallery, one can see how a section of the public would find fault with his work, which from a superficial standpoint, depicts topless or sometimes naked women with the men that like to ogle at them.  In contrast, Thom’s black and white prints are more understated and yet no less bolder in their depiction of hypersexualised courtship. With this third series, both artists hope to burst the perception that only a specific crop of sleazy men frequent spots like strip clubs, as painted in the piece titled Puss in Boots, among others. Michael Soi says he is actually more intrigued with the men in his paintings, who could easily be respectable businessmen, lawyers or even your brothers and friends. ‘Sex & The City III’ challenges societal expectations of how men and women should present themselves, in contrast to who they truly are under the cover of darkness.  One conspicuous large pink painting shows a church reverend in custom gear, holding a bible in one hand with the other dipped into a woman’s bra.  As at the second last day of the exhibition, most paintings seemed to have already been sold.
