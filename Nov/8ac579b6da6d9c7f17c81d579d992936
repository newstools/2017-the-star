Casual workers who lost their jobs following the suspension of the Ugatuzi na Kazi programme in Garissa county have hope for employment. Garissa Governor Ali Korane yesterday said he had negotiated with the Youth ministry to hirethe workers. Addressing the press in Garissa town, Korane said all constituencies, except Garissa Township, will employ 900 youths between 18 and 35 years.  Garissa has six constituencies. Youths in Ijara, Balambala, Lagdera, Dadaab and Fafi will be absorbed in the new programme. The Ugatuzi na Kazi programme was initiated by former Governor Nathif Jama.  It employed 1,530 casual labourers. The majority of them were from poor families. The programme was suspended by Korane, who argued it lacked a legal framework for budgetary allocation.  The move had led to demonstrations, as the workers protested the loss of their jobs. Korane said he will initiate a community service programme with a proper legal framework and get endorsement from the county assembly.
