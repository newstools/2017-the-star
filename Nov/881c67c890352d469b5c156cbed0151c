The Kitui county assembly on Thursday approved all county executive nominees to allow Governor Charity Ngilu get down to work. Ngilu had told the MCAs that delays in the approval of the nominees was stagnating county operations. Presenting the report of the appointment committee to the assembly on Thursday, minority leader John Kisangau said it was prudent for MCAs to approve all the nominees so that they start work immediately. He said rejecting the nominees would make Ngilu's work difficult. Majority leader Peter Kilonzo seconded Kisangau. He said MCAs should not reject executive appointees for lack of required qualifications because they are political employees. Most of the ten nominees are not professionals in the fields of their dockets. Miambani MCA Alex Ng'ang'a said only chief officers need to be professionals in the departments they head. Tharaka MCA Fredrick Nthuri opposed the approvals. He said his Tharaka minority was not considered in the appointments. Ngilu said the MCAs will be sworn in next week.
