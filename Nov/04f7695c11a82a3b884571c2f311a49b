A court on Monday issued a warrant of arrest for Kisumu Senator Fred Outa and former Deputy Governor Ruth Odinga. The two were supposed to appear before chief magistrate Julius Ng’arng’ar for the mention of a case in which they are accused of disrupting an IEBC training session. Advocate Verah Onsongo told the court Outa could not be reached on the phone, while Odinga was unwell. Ng’arng’ar issued the arrest warrants, saying the two were granted bail on grounds they would be able to attend court sessions. The two face five charges. They are accused of entering an electoral centre on October 23 without permission, obstructing an election officer from executing lawful duties contrary to Election Offences Act and malicious damage of property.

Outa and Odinga were accused of stealing 94 plastic chairs and 11 tent stands valued at Sh92,500 belonging to Tausi Designs and Promotion Ltd. Outa faced an additional charge of incitement to violence. He allegedly said “demolish and destroy these IEBC equipment and tents”. The case will be mentioned today. A woman contracted by the commission to provide the tents and chairs was allegedly roughed up. Director of Public Prosecutions Keriako Tobiko ordered the immediate arrests of the politicians. He asked the DCI to charge them with incitement to violence and storming an IEBC training session on October 18.
