Laikipia county police commander Simon Kipkeu has defended his officers over shooting livestock in Olmoran. Kipkeu instead said it was the herders who attacked the police during the incident in Laikipia North subcounty on Wednesday last week. Addressing the media in his Nanyuki town office yesterday, Kipkeu said the illegal herders were heavily armed. They started shooting at the officers on patrol while hiding amidst the animals, the police chief said. The police commander said the herders from Samburu and Isiolo arrived a week earlier prior to the October 26 repeat election and invaded private farms. “The herders started shooting at the Armoured Personnel Carrier. Our officers fired back and that is when the livestock were killed in the crossfire,” Kipkeu said. He said some herders could have escaped with gunshot wounds. Kipkeu is working with his counterparts in the neighbouring counties to establish where the herders are receiving treatment. In the last four months, eight police officers have been killed by the armed bandits and 14 others injured. Some parts of Laikipia have been listed as disturbed and dangerous. Kipkeu denied that KDF officers were involved in the operation to flush out immigrant herders.  Laikipia North MP Sarah Lekorere also faulted the security officers over the shooting of livestock, saying other methods could have been used to drive them away.  “These animals did not lead themselves to where they were, they were led. It was wrong to shoot dead about 300 head of cattle,” said Lekorere. The exact number of livestock killed is still unknown.
