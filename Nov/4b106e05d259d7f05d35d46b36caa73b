The government has become too fond of sweeping sensitive
issues under the carpet, almost as if they never happened. Three incidents
illustrate this and they all concern the National Police Service. The first is the November 1 shooting of cows escorted by
armed herders in Laikipia. Witnesses say at least 300 cows were shot dead by
police and at most 1,500, but a police source says “only 73” were killed.  The police narrative that the armed herders were using the
cows as shields as they fired on officers does not wash. There were no reports of those arrested, injured and, or
killed. And then there was the October 22 shooting of an heir of
Bobmil Mattresses at his home in Westlands by masked anti-terror police
reportedly looking for an arms cache and terrorists in the house next door.  The prolonged high profile raid on billionaire Jimi
Wanjigi’s home in Muthaiga, Nairobi, where weapons were apparently seized,
remains unexplained. A reformed and democratic police service provides clarity
and information and updates.
