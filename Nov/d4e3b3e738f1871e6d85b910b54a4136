Construction of a cruise ship terminal at the Port of Mombasa is taking too long and the country might be locked out of the latest cruise circuit. Tourism CS Najib Balala yesterday said it takes two to three years to arrange a cruise programme and preparations for the next programme are ongoing. Balala said Kenya committed to form part of the circuit during the Sea Trade Convention held in Miami, Florida, in March. He said Kenya will have nothing to offer. “The unfortunate and disappointing issue is that construction is taking too long,” Balala said. “If we don’t commit and we lack a tangible programme, cruise ship operators will not put us on their schedule,” he said.  “How can we go there, yet we have no facility to confirm? We’ll not be able to sign contracts with cruise ships if we lack a facility. Already, we have delayed in our promises,” he said. Kenya will lose trust of tourism partners, he said. On November 21, Kenya Ports Authority MD Catherine Muturi was quoted as saying work on the external part of the cruise facility was complete. She said construction of the interior of the terminal were underway. “The project is expected to be completed by June 2018,” she said.
