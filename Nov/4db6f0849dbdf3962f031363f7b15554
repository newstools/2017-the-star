It is not a coincidence that Diamond Platnumz and Hamisa Mobetto were in Dubai at the same time. Everyone noticed this, and so did Zari. Hamissa Mobetto has denied that it was planned.  Zari took to Snapchat to air her feelings. "Good morning fam, this one is for the players. Are you the type of guy you'd wish your daughter to date some day? Would you welcome a guy like yourself to date your daughter?" Like that is not enough, Zari throws more barbs at Diamond, "Shout out to real men out there respecting themselves and being role models to their children showing them what's wrong and right....to the real men playing parental roles in their kids lives, to men who respect their families, you're the real MVP."
