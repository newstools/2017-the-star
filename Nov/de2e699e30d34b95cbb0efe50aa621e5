Nairobi Governor Mbuvi Sonko (pictured) has warned those planning to hold demonstrations tomorrow in Nairobi during the swearing-in ceremony in the name of a memorial service that they will not be tolerated. The governor said Jacaranda Gardens will be out of bounds to any protesters seeking to disrupt the swearing-in of President Uhuru Kenyatta. Nairobi county commander Japhet Koome has declared NASA’s planned memorial service in Jacaranda Grounds illegal. Koome said the police’s priority tomorrow during Uhuru’s inauguration will be to secure Nairobi city, insisting the opposition has not informed police of the planned event.

The governor spoke at the burial of his friend Joram Kihonge in Wamagana, Tetu, Nyeri county on Saturday. He was with Kirinyaga woman representative Wangui Ngirici, Starehe MP Charles Jaguar, Tetu MP Gichuhi Mwangi and Nyeri county assembly speaker John Kaguchia. Sonko said the opposition must respect the law. The latest city protest left people robbed, stabbed and raped by protestors, which the governor said is unacceptable.  “As leaders, we respect Raila, as a statesman, he knows the Constitution and he is aware that any attempt to be sworn in is uncalled for,” Sonko said.
