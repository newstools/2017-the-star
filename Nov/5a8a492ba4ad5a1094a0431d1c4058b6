The Catholic Diocese of Isiolo is organising post-election dialogue forums to foster cohesion in wards most affected by divisions during the electioneering period. Through the Catholic Justice and Peace Commission and with the help of area elders, the church has identified particular wards that have been worst-hit by the just-concluded elections. CJPC coordinator Nancy Minage said the divisions have been so bad that supporters of the two major political sides – Jubilee and NASA – could no longer shake hands. This is despite the fact that they had lived harmoniously for many years before this year's election. Minage spoke at Ngaremara on Monday. She said some elders and the community policing chairperson realised that political temperature was rising in Ngaremara after former MCA Peter Losu was defeated by Ekwam Teru. They advised the church to move in and help restore normalcy. Minage said exaggerated celebrations by Ekwam’s supporters was only deepening the already existing rifts and could lead to unnecessary flareups. She said the Catholic Justice and Peace Commission will extend the forums to other wards within the county that have similar issues to Ngaremara ward. Area community policing initiative chairperson Grace Lolim said dialogue will provide a healing platform. She said by opening up on the issues hurting them in the presence of "rivals", various individuals would tone down the antagonism and pave the way for normalcy to return in Ngaremara ward. Lolim proposed that women have their own forum to express what they could not say in the presence of youths. She urged Ngaremara residents to accept the reality that the one who clinched the seat is the leader to both those who voted for and against him. Ngaremara ward is mainly inhabited by the Turkana community.
