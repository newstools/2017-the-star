Poor Kenyans could soon receive incentives, including money and goods, whenever they seek health services.  The Ministry of Health has proposed the programme in places, including Northern Kenya, where locals have largely shunned hospital services such as immunisation and delivery, yet the government has improved facilities and made them free. Health workers will also be rewarded when they achieve performance targets, such as immunising a certain percentage of children in a given area.  However, if the government takes the World Health Organisation model, only the health workers will receive the financial incentives.  results-based financing  Health CS Cleopa Mailu said the Results Based Financing is one of the proposals being considered to help Kenya achieve universal primary healthcare and expand services available to the population. “These programmes range from maternal and child health, HIV, TB and malaria, noncommunicable diseases, improved health infrastructure and equipment, health commodities and supplies and robust disease surveillance and response,” he said.  The CS made the remarks in Nairobi on Friday during a preparatory meeting towards the UHC forum, which will be held in Tokyo and the launch of Japan’s policy and Human Resources Development Fund project in Kenya.  The Kenyan programme is likely to be supported by Japan. The CS observed the government had in 2013 made free maternity services free, introduced health subsidies for the poor and elderly and waived all health service costs for children under the age of five years.
