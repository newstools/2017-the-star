The Catholic Church will in the next few days appoint an acting bishop for the Diocese of Eldoret following the death of Bishop Cornelius Korir. Korir was buried inside the Sacred Heart Cathedral in Eldoret.  The Pope’s representative in Kenya, Archbishop Charles Daniel Balvo, on Saturday said it may take time to get Korir’s replacement.  He said,  “His death has left me with a big task of identifying the new bishop, but we will soon appoint someone in an acting capacity as we look into how we will get the person to take over from Bishop Korir.”  Leaders urged the church to pick a replacement who will continue the work started.  Korir was buried in a tomb inside the Sacred Heart Cathedral in Eldoret.  According to Catholic doctrine, a bishop who dies while still in office can be buried inside the church or at a special resting place specifically prepared for bishops. The burial was preceded by a state-funded funeral service attended by 70,000 mourners. Korir’s casket was made of mahogany. It was placed in a concrete tomb that was shut with wooden locks.
