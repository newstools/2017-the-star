The selection and placement of the more than 1,000,000 candidates who sat this year’s KCPE examination will begin on December 4. The process will end on December 12 ahead of the January admission. Education CS Fred Matiang’i said selection will be done on merit, equity, candidates’ choice of schools and the capacity and category of schools. Speaking during the release of the 2017 KCPE results yesterday, Matiang’i said the more than 9,000 students in public and private primary schools who attained more than 400 marks iwill be admitted to national schools. The CS further guaranteed a place in form one to all candidates who sat this year’s KCPE exam following the new policy of 100 per cent transition to secondary schools. “All the one million-plus children should prepare to be admitted to any of the school categories available,” Matiang’i said.
