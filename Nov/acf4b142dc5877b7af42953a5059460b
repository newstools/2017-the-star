Migori residents have been urged to give accurate data to government agencies to help in planning. Peter Mutu, the Suna West subcounty commissioner, said by giving the right data, relevant authorities will be able to analyse county and national development. Addressing participants during the African Statistics Day in Migori last Friday, Mutu said the department of statistics requires crucial and credible information to help plan. “By giving false data, many government departments find it difficult to come up with the right plan for their agenda to help residents,” Mutu saud. Migori county director of statistics Kennedy Odede said through factual data, crucial information will be gathered to help in making credible recommendations to help  residents in resource mobilasation. “We have liaised with chiefs and local opinion leaders to get factual information, especially in far-flung villages,” Odede said. The two said residents do not like to share details of their wealth, family and past criminal records for fear of being victimised. Nyasare chief John Ombura urged government officers to consult local leaders and elders when seeking data. He said sidelining chiefs is unwise because they know locals well and can make the government’s work easier.
