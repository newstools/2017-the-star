A court in Kapenguria on Friday sentenced a 26-year-old man to death for murdering his friend. Gibson Mnang'at alias Kortin was found guilty of murdering Pius Yego on March 4 at Rena village in Cheptulel, Pokot Central constituency, West Pokot county. Yego's widow said the two men were good friends and that they had not had any argument before the attack. The court heard that Mnang'at threatened to kill Yego's 10-year-old son after the boy declined to disclose his father's whereabouts. "He told the minor he would kill him instead of his father," the court heard. "The accused shot twice at the boy but missed. The minor grabbed his younger sibling and fled to another part of the farm where their mother was." The widow said that after hearing the gunshots, she placed her other child in a chair and went outside to find out what had happened. It was then that the woman saw Mnang'at walking in her direction with a firearm. She said the attacker threatened to shoot them by firing in the air. In the confusion, one bullet ripped through Yego's thigh. The woman said her husband was rushed to hospital but died on the way. The accused was arrested and remanded in police custody after failing to secure a Sh300,000 cash bail or Sh500,000 bond. Mnang'at said he was remorseful and asked the judge to reduce the punishment as he has children who look up to him. Judge Stephen Githinji said it was clear the man intended to kill hence must be punished. "The law has taken its course. Evidence before the court indicates the accused did the act intentionally and by law, he has to spend the rest of his life in jail."
