Nakuru Governor Lee Kinyanjui has warned health facilities against dumping waste at the Gioto dumpsite. He said the county will not relocate the 25-acre site as former county boss Kinuthia Mbugua had proposed. Kinyanjui said the county aims to get rid of all garbage on roadsides, adding it has become a menace. He spoke yesterday during the rehabilitation of the dumpsite. “The garbage had spilled to the roadside, causing discomfort to motorists and posing a health hazard to residents. We are therefore pushing the garbage off the roadside and then we shall plant trees ,” he said. Kinyanjui said the county is working with hospitals to ensure no medical waste is dumped in the area.
