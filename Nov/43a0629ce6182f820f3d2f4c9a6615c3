  The national government will build at least one million low-cost houses in informal settlements in Nairobi in five years. Housing and Urban Development PS Aidah Munano said the programme will begin in January. “We will build the houses in Kibera, Mariguini,
Huruma and other Eastlands estates that [are on] government land,” she said. Munano spoke at St Mary's Catholic Church, Murang’a, on
Sunday. She said the programme will be rolled out in phases. The first one will be in Eastlands and will cost Sh23 billion. The money from the sale of
the houses will be used to build the second phase. “This project will thrust the country forward in its
bid to eradicate slums and will give residents of informal settlements access
to social services such as water, electricity, toilets and proper roads,” Munano
added.
