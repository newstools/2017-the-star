A 73-year-old retired teacher has filed a divorce case at a Kangema court on grounds her husband, 76, has neglected his matrimonial duties. Marcella Mukami, from Kiru location in Mathioya constituency, claims Peter Kinyugo, her husband of 55 years, abandoned her after marrying a second wife. She accused the husband - a retired chief - of neglecting the family since marrying Triza Mulinge in 1984. "The problems in our marriage were aggravated six years ago when my husband started spending weeks in my co-wife's home without paying me a visit," Mukami told the court. She said when Kirugo married the second wife, she was pushed out of her home and moved to a house they had converted into a cow pen. Mukami and Kinyugo have one child while her husband has sired three children with the second wife. Senior resident magistrate Dennis Kivuti adjourned the hearing after Mukami protested a request by the husband to produce family photographs and NHIF documents. The magistrate scheduled the case for hearing on January 18, 2018, to give the parties time to exchange their details and documents so the suit proceeds. Kinyungo had asked the court to allow the case to proceed saying the photographs showed Mukami and her co-wife Mulinge had actively engaged in family activities together. But Mukami's lawyer Margaret Nyang'ati objected the production of the documents saying her husband was ambushing her instead of following legal procedures. Mukami was brought to the court in a wheelchair from Huruma hospital in Nanyuki where she is admitted. Her lawyer told the court that the husband previously helped her but withdrew his support even though they live in the same compound. The woman filed the petition on December 20 last year, seeking maintenance and termination of their marriage. Click here for the latest political news Â
