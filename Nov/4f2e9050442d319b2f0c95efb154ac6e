There is crisis at Baringo County Referral Hospital after Kenya Medical Training College, Kabarnet Campus withdraw their students’ services because of the nurses’ strike. An official close of the college said the students were transferred to Nandi county’s Kapsabet Hospital and Eldama Ravine. “There were low admission of patients, especially expectant mothers in the maternity wingsince the nurses’ strike began in June,” the source told the Star on Tuesday. He said up to 100 nursing, nutrition and environmental health science students were moved indefinitely.  We chose Nandi county hospitals because the health sector there is up and running after Governor Paul Sang ended the nurses’ strike last month” he said. The College Students president George Odenyo confirmed the transfer of the students, although he never had the exact number because a majority of them were still at home after the election.  Our major challenge here still remains lack of clinical experience due to shortage of places of attachment due to ongoing nurses’ strike,” Odenyo said.  A nurse attached to Kabarnet Hospital said the facility is facing an acute staffing crisis especially after the withdrawal of KMTC students,” he said.  He said a total of 93 nurses, serving various departments among them theatre, renal unit and outpatient were on strike. But the hospital medical superintendent Dr Stephen Kalya allayed fears of os crisis after the college withdrew its students.  “Our hospital is still operational as we decided to hire a number of part-time qualified nurses to carry out the 60 per cent health operations in the hospital,” he said. Kalya said clinical officers have resumed duty and were serving in Baringo North, South and Central, Tiaty, Mogoio and Eldama Ravine subcounty hospitals.
