Kiss FM's Adelle Onyango is one of the panelists set to speak at this year's Children's Global Media Summit on December 5 to7. She will be speaking alongside Australia’s leading cyber safety expert Susan McLean, and Prof Sonia Livingstone OBE, member of the Royal Foundation Taskforce on Prevention of Cyberbullying. "The summit will seek to redesign the digital world for future generations of young people, within five themes of empowerment, innovation, freedom, entertainment and education. And the major thing that disrupts that is cyber bullying — something I’ve openly experienced and addressed!" Adelle said. She continued, "How I defeat bullies is by not giving them my power. I think what’s important is to know yourself and know that you’re on a journey to knowing yourself. It’s also to know that bullying has nothing to do with you — it’s hurting people who hurt others. It’s the bully who is going through issues, not you. Knowing this takes away the bully’s power to control you and to claim you as a victim.” Adelle, who was named one of the BBC 100 Women, said, "The opportunities to represent Kenya have been amazing! I have received invites from the African Union and more. It’s made it clear that now a greater, louder voice from me, on the matters I’m passionate about, is needed! I’m happy to represent Kenya at this summit." As a social activist, Adelle looks forward to giving Kenya and Africa a say in this conversation “because it’ll lead to solutions, much-needed solutions, as I know my country has many young people, who are creative enough to shape African content online, and we need to ensure they can do that safely!” The summit will feature keynote speeches from leading figures at YouTube, Sesame Workshop, Viacom Africa, The Envisioners and The Premier League.
