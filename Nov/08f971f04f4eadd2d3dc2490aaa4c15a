The Migori assembly will pass a motion for the formation of a People’s Assembly on Tuesday next week. Homa Bay and Siaya counties passed the bill after NASA leaders urged MCAs to pass the motion, which will help its sagenda at grassroots level. Speaking to the press at the Migori county assembly offices on Thursday, speaker Boaz Okoth, Majority leader and Oruba Ragana MCA Mallan Ogega and NASA chief whip and South Kanyamkago MCA Graham Kagali said the motion will sail through. “When the assembly resumes their sittings on Tuesday, the motion will be the first issue to be discussed and I believe it will not take up to two sittings for it to be passed,” Okoth said. Kagali said opposition members have received the motion and are going through it. “We are already set for the exercise of passing the motion and Migori county has been special as we are cosmopolitan, but we will use our numbers to bulldoze it through,” he said. Kagali said the motion will include campaign teams for all MCAs and aspirants in all 40 wards will be included in the assemblies to help push through the opposition agenda. “We have already instructed members in the county and other national leaders like legislators, senators, governors and the woman representatives to offer their campaign teams in the local assemblies,” Kagali said. Ogega said the motion is based on the idea of the people “whose time has come to help shape the national agenda”. Ogega and Kagali said among the key issues the assembly will tackle is how to have an effective economic boycott by blacklisting products singled out by the opposition.  “So far, among opposition MCAs, the boycott and moving our phone numbers is 95 per cent complete,” Kagali said.
