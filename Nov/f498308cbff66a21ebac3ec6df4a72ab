On Halloween day, the nightmare of relegation became a reality for the Muhoroni Youth as they were thrashed 6-2 at their own backyard by Bandari in Kisumu yesterday. Former international Edwin Lavatsa turned back the hands of time with a virtuoso performance, netting twice in each half with a missed penalty thrown into the mix to send Muhoroni closer to the exit door. The match, just like their other remaining four, was deemed a must win for Muhoroni but it’s a point the KPL Top 8 holders failed to take to heart. With just 13 minutes on the clock, Wilberforce Lugogo exchanged passes with Siraj Mohammed who picked Lavatsa to open the scoring. The goal seemed to take the stuffing out of Muhoroni as Bandari looked the dangerous side. Lugogo limped off midway through the half to be replaced by Wambani Anthony. The striker combined with Darius Msagha to put the second on a plate for Lavatsa on the stroke of half-time. From then on the Awasi based side faced a herculean task to reverse the game in front of their own home support. They, however, wilted under the pressure brought about by internal problems and left the visitors run roughshod over them in the second half at their own stronghold. Substitute Wambani punished some lax defending from Muhoroni seven minutes into the second half to end the game as a contest. Two further goals from Lavatsa on either side of Muhoroni’s double consolation from Robert Kiyoyo and Baron Oketch’s stunner completed the goal blitz. The only factor that remains constant for Muhoroni even after their latest capitulation is that they need to win all their remaining matches to have a sniff of survival.
