Randiek made good use of his serves and managed tie the match at 4-4. The left handed Tuyisheme then wrapped up the first set with easy wins in the subsequent games.
Randiek came out firing on all cylinders in the second set as he outplayed his opponent without losing game to tie the set. Randiek’s momentum spilt into the third set where he held his nerve to win. Randiek praised his opponent for the level of play and challenge he offered and vowed to fight in the remaining matches. “I was a bit nervous in the first set but in the subsequent sets, I had the right composure and handled his serves well. He was strong and challenged me to work harder. I will try my best in the remaining matches and I am hopeful I will be victorious.”
Njogu had an easy time in the first set dropping two games to settle for a 6-2 win. His Serbian opponent battle back in the second set, winning four games but a determined Njogu held on to progress.
