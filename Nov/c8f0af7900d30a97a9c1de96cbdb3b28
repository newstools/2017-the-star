Residents and leaders in Meru county on Monday celebrated the Supreme Court rulling upholding President Uhuru Kenyatta’s contentious reelection. Business came to a standstill as the jubilant supporters converged in streets, market centres and entertainment venues to celebrate. The residents led by North Imenti MP Rahim Dawood marched through Meru town with convoys of motorbikes, chanting slogans saying NASA leader Raila Odinga must retire. “The opposition should wait until 2022 where they will face Deputy President William Ruto. However leaders can dialogue for the sake of peace,” Dawood said. He called on the state to withhold funding for counties that endorsed People’s Assemblies pushed by NASA.
