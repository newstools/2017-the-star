Homa Bay County Assembly is unable to account for more than Sh825,807,457 spent during the 2015-2016 financial year. This is according to a recent report by auditor general Edward Ouko. The unaccounted funds include unsecured car loans and mortgages to MCAs and county staff, under expenditure of recurrent and development allocations, variances between payroll and master roll. In the audit query as at June 30, 2016, cash equivalent to Sh26,534,114 was at variance with the cash book balance of Sh13,835,251 in the bank reconciliation statement for account no 011456870100. There is an unexplained difference of Sh12,698,863. The assembly issued Sh180,324,323 car loans and mortgages to MCAs and staff through Homa Bay car loans and mortgages scheme. However, a separate financial statement was not submitted to Ouko as required by Section 167( 3 ) of the Public Funds Management Act 2012. The management also failed to provide evidence the county government jointly owned vehicles and property with the borrowers to secure the assembly’s interests. The assembly could not account for Sh52 million and Sh75,133,928, which was under spent in recurrent and development allocations. It owes Sh48,837,376 in pending bills to contractors, suppliers and staff among others. According to Ouko, Sh68,406,410 was paid by cheque, however, the expenditure had no supporting documents. The auditor general further said there is variance between payroll and master roll. The accuracy and completeness of the compensation of employees’ expenditure of Sh388,406,557 could not be ascertained. “The statement receipts and payments reflects compensation of employees’ expenditure of Sh388,406,557, while the payroll provided for audit review supports Sh259,623,554. The is an unexplained variance of Sh128,783,003. Payments of ward staff totalling Sh3,954,816 for October 2015 and April 2016 were neither supported by the master roll nor was there evidence indicating who beneficiaries are. “Consequently, the accuracy and completeness of the compensation of employees figure Sh388,406,557 could not be ascertained,” the auditor general said.
