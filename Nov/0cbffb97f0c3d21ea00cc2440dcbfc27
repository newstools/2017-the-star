Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has sent two top inspectorate officers on compulsory leave for allegedly sabotaging his efforts to manage the hawkers’ menace in the CBD. Caleb Otieno, the director in charge of operations in the Inspectorate department, and his assistant Albert Cherop allegedly were facilitating hawkers to sell their wares downtown. Sonko is trying to clear the CBD and regulate hawkers. “You are hereby required to proceed on compulsory leave with immediate effect and not later than November 2, until you are recalled to office,” reads a letter dated Tuesday, signed by acting county secretary Leboo Morintat. This comes less than a week after seven city askaris were arrested and charged with robbing hawkers. The seven worked under Otieno and Cherop. “I cannot allow officers to sabotage the county on handling hawkers. They have been suspended to pave way for investigations,” Sonko said. Leboo, in another letter dated the same day, appointed Joseph Kipsang as the acting director of the department and Tom Oyath as his deputy, effective yesterday.
