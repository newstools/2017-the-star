Tourism CS Najib Balala says he will discuss with Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho how best to clean the city to attract tourists.  The mounds of garbage have become an eyesore. Joho’s administration has been on the spot.  Mombasa is expected to host the Skal International Congress at Pride Inn Hotel next year. The conference was supposed to be held in October 2015 at the same venue. It was pushed to 2018 after Western countries issued travel advisories. On Saturday, Balala said Kenya cannot afford to lose the hosting rights over issues that can be addressed.  There have been negative stories about poor hygiene and a cholera outbreak in Mombasa. Joho was speaking at the Port of Mombasa when he received more than 640 passengers and 320 crew members on board MS Nautica Cruise ship. About 1,000 delegates from across the world are expected to attend the Skal International Conference next year. “We should do damage control quickly before we get cancellations,” the CS said. “I am impressed with the way the governor is handling the cholera issue,” Balala said. Last week, 25 people were diagnosed with the disease. Two deaths have been reported. Fifteen MCAs from Migori were admitted to hospitals in Mombasa over suspected cholera. But doctors said they had food poisoning.  Health executive Hazel Koitaba said the cholera patients have been isolated. Food vending has been banned. The Environment department has in the past one week been collecting garbage. Environment executive Godfrey Nato said yesterday are developing a five-year County Integrated Development Plan which will incorporate waste management. The Joho administration has been blamed for failing to manage waste.
