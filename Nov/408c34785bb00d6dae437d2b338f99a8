Claims of voter bribery were raised during a petition against Homa Bay Governor Cyprian Awiti yesterday. The allegations were made during cross-examination of former governor candidate Oyugi Magwanga’s witnesses. Magwanga is challenging the reelection Awiti. Two witnesses Gordon Owiti and Wilson Okumu said they witnessed voter bribery in the August 8 poll. Owiti , who was in charge of cordinating agents in Kwabwai ward, Ndhiwa, said he witnessed people perceived to be Awiti’s agents giving voters money.  Okumu, who was Magwanga’s agent at Osika Primary School, said people who were bribed were given lists directing them to vote for the ODM candidates. But Awiti’s lawyer Steve Biko and IEBC lawyer Fredrick Orego objected, saying two failed to table evidence.
