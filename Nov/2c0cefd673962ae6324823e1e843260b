The hearing of Sh60 million graft case against Kipipiri MP Amos Kimunya and two others yesterday failed to proceed for the second time. Kimunya, Lilian Njenga and Jughae Wainaina are charged with abuse of office and fraudulently disposing of Sh60 million public property. The case was scheduled for hearing before Milimani trial magistrate Felix Kombo but could not proceed, as the magistrate was not present. Another magistrate, Lawrence Mugambi, directed the case be mentioned next Tuesday for fixing fresh hearing dates. On November 20, the matter was put off after the court was told the defence lawyers were said to be engaged in petition cases in different courts. Senior state counsel Daniel Karuri told the court he was ready to proceed with two witnesses. Witness Joseph Wanuma, an Agriculture ministry officer in Kinangop, had testified.
