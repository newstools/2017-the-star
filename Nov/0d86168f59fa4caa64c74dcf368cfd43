Kenya has deported 30 people involved in drug trafficking within universities, acting Interior CS Fred Matiang'i said yesterday. In April, the government launched investigations in public universities, following reports that drug cartels were operating openly. Matiang'i, who is also the Education CS, said some drug lords are using students to sell hard drugs in universities, leading to an increase in cases of unrest. The CS said, "We have recently deported more than 30 drug peddlers posing as students in various universities in the country." Matiang'i said the government asked the institutions to ensure the drugs are done away with. "We have been fairly ruthless in deporting international students who have either been caught selling drugs or are part of cartels," he said. "We have imposed serious responsibilities on our universities to ensure they are used for learning, not peddling drugs." The CS said the war on drugs has been successful, but is not yet over. "Let me not pretend...we have not been 100 per cent successful in control. The traffickers think ahead of us in terms of how they move the drugs," he said. "We are facing a crisis ... we have tried our best as a country." Early in the year, President Uhuru Kenyatta talked tough against drug dealing during a visit to the Coast. He said his administration would eliminate barons. But he has been criticised for reiterating his remarks over the years, while the illegal business thrives. Deputy President William Ruto said money from drug dealing is used to fund terrorists. Al Shabaab militants have continued to carry out attacks in several parts of Kenya in response to the KDF's presence in Somalia, as part of the Amisom peacekeeping force.
