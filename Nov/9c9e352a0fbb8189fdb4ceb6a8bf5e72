Pictures have emerged of what is believed to be Deputy President William Ruto's nearly completed home in Uasin Gishu. The building, a plush, multi-million-shilling residence in Eldoret town, has a complete private airstrip. Aerial photos show the home has a main house with a gazebo right in front of it.  It also has an artificial lake in the middle of the compound and six other houses at the front.   The stately home sits on an estimated 20 acres, part of 700 the DP bought in Moiben constituency in 2015. The land was part of the 6,000-acre Jagir Farm, known locally as Kapkochir, whose owner was an Asian businessman.  Ruto often self-deprecates as a hustler who once sold chickens by a railway line. But the Deputy President also owns the five-star Weston Hotel opposite Wilson Airport, Nairobi. The Star first wrote about the home in 2015 but Ruto later denied that he was spending Sh1.2 billion on it. "I would be daft to take Sh1.2 billion to a village to build a house in which I will stay for a week a year. That story is ridiculous," Ruto said in a TV interview days after the story ran.  Read: Ruto building sh1.2bn home in Uasin Gishu
