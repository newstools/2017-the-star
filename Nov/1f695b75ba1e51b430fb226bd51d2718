Gaudencia Makokha is now a left attacker at her new WTS KDBS Bank Wloclawek club in the Polish second tier league. Makokha, a former Kenya Pipeline right attacker, left the country early this month for a three-year renewable contract with the polish side. The former St. Christopher Secondary School player has so far featured in two matches and remains optimistic of a good run going forward. “When I got here, I was a right attacker but at the end of my first training session, my coach Marek Zacharek told me I had good reception and agility on the court that reflects a left attacking department and immediately switched me to the left position and so far I am doing fine,” observed  Makokha. “Currently, we lead the league standing unbeaten from five matches and for me, it remains a learning curve.  “Definitely it’s a good thing to play in as many positions as  possible and I am now happy that I can now double up as both a right and a left attacker.” Makokha, also a beach volleyball player said in Europe, teams tend to invest more time in gym work and less in training sessions— a move she said was key in helping the players enhance their stamina in the game. Makokha admitted the league is competitive but was quick to note that her team was up to the challenge if their current position on table standing is anything to go by. “The facilities here are on another level. My team-mates and the technical bench are welcoming and have been supportive since I got here. Poland and specifically Wloclawek is a nice place but people are surprised to see a black skin. Here it’s winter and I am slowly adopting to the weather,” observed Makokha. She continued: “There is no much difference as far as food is concerned  because I still get to eat fish, chicken, rice, chips and mashed potatoes and beef although I miss githeri big time. I am slowly learning the Polish and so far so good.”
