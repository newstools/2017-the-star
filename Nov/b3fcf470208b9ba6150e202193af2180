The Maasai Council of Elders has urged President Uhuru Kenyatta and opposition leader Raila Odinga to embrace dialogue. National organising secretary Hassan Kamwaro yesterday said the two sides should unite for the sake of peace and stability. Speaking to the press in Narok town, Kamwaro said the President should bring on board  Raila, clerics and other leaders and preach peace. “I know how bitter Raila is because he lost an election. But that does not mean we should fight. This country is bigger than these politicians,” Kamwaro said. The former Transport and Licensing Board chairman urged Jubilee politicians, including Uhuru, to ensure once he is sworn in tomorrow, there will be unity. “Uhuru is a symbol of unity in the country and as a leader he will find it hard to lead a polarised nation as a result of an election,” he said.
