Kenya will not avenge Tanzania’s burning of chicks and auctioning of cattle from this country, Foreign Affairs CS Amina Mohamed said yesterday. Tanzania authorities last week burned chicks from Kenya on suspicion that they had bird flu. They also auctioned Maasai cows, saying they had invaded their territory. Amina has ruled out any revenge. She said the two countries are already in talks to resolve the impasse. “We don’t want to engage in correcting something by doing another wrong thing. Our people are watching. We highly feel these things should not have happened,” Amina said in Nairobi yesterday. “When you have a tit for tat, you are perpetuating a wrong and we are not in the business of doing a wrong,” she added. She said she is in talks with her counterpart in Dar es Salaam to ensure sustainable understanding that “will not change with happenings”.   She said the government will ensure those affected get compensation.
