Gold miners in Central and South Sakwa in Bondo have been warned against using explosives. Siaya county director of Environment Gabriel Oduor said explosives destroy the environment. He said residents of Luora and Dago had complained. Oduor said buildings at Dago Primary School have huge cracks.  Oduor said pregnant women are developing health complications. “There is defiance of the order that was given by our office to stop the use of explosives and we are going to follow legal means and existing administrative structure to curb the use of explosives by miners,” Oduor said on Friday. He spoke during a stakeholders’ meeting in Wagusu, Central Sakwa. He said only trained, licensed individuals are allowed to use explosives.  Permits in the region are only issued to licensed quarry operators, he said. Oduor said the stop orders were issued through the Nema office after they received complaints from residents of Luora and Dago villages about use of explosives that was exposing them to health hazards. “It’s now evident that the use of explosive in mining has threatened the lives of both animals and residents in the region and we cannot allow it,” he warned. Nyanza geologist Maurice Ndeda said the 2016 Mining Act prohibits miners from using explosives and stone crushers. He accused local administrators of abetting the use of explosives.  Ndeda said he has reported a businesswoman from Wagusu has been selling explosives to the miners. “The woman is the major distributor. We’ll soon catch her,” Ndeda said. He said no one Central or South Sakwa has been licensed to use explosives. They may be from Magare quarry in the neighborring Rarieda.
