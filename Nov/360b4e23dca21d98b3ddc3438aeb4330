Suspected armed Pokot bandits killed my mathematics teacher, a top KCPE candidate in Baringo North subcounty has said. Joy Chepkelio, 14, who did her KCPE exam at Atiar Primary School, scored 411 marks. She was the top pupil in Baringo North subcounty. Chepkelio said it was traumatising to lose her teacher - Daniel Kangogo - who was shot dead by bandits. Kangogo was killed while attending to his livestock in Chepkesin in March. The killing occurred about six kilometres away from the school. “We always learned in fear as we would always hear gunshots,” Chepkelio said, adding she usually worried her teachers might be killed. “We encouraged ourselves of life ahead and focussed on our studies,” she said. Chepkelio said after losing her teacher, she almost despaired, but her parents, teachers and religious leaders encouraged her to remain in the school. Chepkelio said headteacher James Kandagor constantly encouraged them. Click here for the latest political news
