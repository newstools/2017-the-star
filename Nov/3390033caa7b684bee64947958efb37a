Heavy rains have caused massive destruction in Mshiu and Ganda villages, Kwale county, and left residents at risk of starvation. Most crops were destroyed and livestock swept away by floodswaters on Tuesday. Residents want the government to urgently supply relief food to the area that was also severely affected by drought. "Some of the maize crops have not grown as seeds were destroyed by rains. We cannot use fertiliser because water has filled our farms," Mishi Tenje said. "We were expecting bumper harvests this season as most of farmers had received support from the government but that hope is gone." Mwakio Kasian, who grows rice in Ganda village, said: "There is the possibility that we will rely on relief food from the government since we cannot farm because of the water on our farms."
