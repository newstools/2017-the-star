This year is set to be in top three hottest years, with record-breaking extreme weather. According to a provisional statement on the State of the Climate by the World Meteorological Organisation, the average global temperature from January to September was approximately 1.1°C above the pre-industrial era. The report says long-term indicators of climate change such as increasing carbon dioxide concentrations, sea level rise and ocean acidification continue unabated. Arctic sea ice coverage, according to the report, remains below average, and previously stable Antarctic sea ice extent is at or near a record low. As a result of a powerful El Niño, 2016 is likely to remain the warmest year on record, with 2017 and 2015 being second and third.  According to the statement, 2013-17 will be the warmest five-year period on record. The WMO statement – which covers January to September - was released on Monday during the opening day of the UN climate change conference in Bonn, Germany. Patricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary of UN Climate Change, which is hosting the Bonn conference, said the findings underline the rising risks to people and economies, if the Paris Agreement is not taken seriously. The Paris Agreement says developed countries will continue to mobilise finance to support developing countries. Meteorological Organisation Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said the past three years have all been in the top three years in terms of temperature records. “This is part of a long term warming trend,” he said. In 2016, 23.5 million people were displaced during weather-related disasters. Kenya declared the 2017 drought a national disaster. Nairobi faced water shortages that compelled city authorities to ration water, whilst cereal prices increased and GDP figures were hit.
