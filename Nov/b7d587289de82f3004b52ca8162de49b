Quins’ forward Herman Humwa is the notable inclusion in the Kenya Sevens squad for the opening legs of the next month’s world series in Dubai and Cape Town.  Head coach Innocent simiyu yesterday said the inclusion of Humwa will give the bench options.  “He is a physical player and a strong ball carrier. He has excelled in training and we want to see what he brings on the big stage,” added Simiyu. Also making a return to the squad is Willy Ambaka, who last played for the Kenya  Sevens squad in Vancouver before heading for professional stint in new Zealand with Manuwatu Turbos. “We are happy to have him back. He brings experience and ability to score tries from anywhere in the field,” added Simiyu, who expects a competitive pool in Dubai with Shujaa meeting Canada, South Africa and Uganda. Shujaa start their campaign against Canada on December 1 at 9:30 am before facing South Africa afternoon at 1:36pm. Shujaa complete their preliminary round later that evening when they face neighbours Uganda at 6:30pm. “Our first match against Canada will be key. We had see-saw matches with them last season and they will be physical. South Africa are the champions and our matches with them have always been close while Uganda are fast-improving team,” added Simiyu.  He said the team’s preparations have been good and the boys are in good physical shape and relishing the challenge. Kenya’s top points scorer, Collins Injera is also in the mix for the Dubai tour. Injera, who sits second on the World Series all time top scorers chart with 244 tries, was last in action at Hong Kong Sevens. Oscar Ayodi will captain the team that jets out on November 27.  The list includes: Willy Ambaka, Dan Sikuta, Herman Humwa (series debut), Jeff Oluoch, Frank Wanyama, Collins Injera, Brian Tanga, Eden Agero, Sammy Oliech, Oscar Ayodi (captain) Nelson Oyoo and Dennis Ombachi.
