A retired nurse arrested for secretly and forcibly circumcising four underage Embu girls, and children’s parents, have been prosecuted. Mary Mbucu was charged with circumcising the girls on October 27 in Igumori village. Jane Mairu, Assunta Muthoni and Lucy Ndegi - the parents of the three girls - were charged with facilitating the procedure. The four denied the charges before Siakago resident magistrate Jackson Omwange, who released them on Sh50,000 bond each and a surety of a similar amount. They were given the option of posting Sh20,000 bail. Prosecutor Margaret Muraguri requested that the girls be moved to Little Angels’ Children’s Home in Makutano, Kirinyaga county, so there is no interference with investigations. The court granted the application and Omwange directed that the case be heard today. The circumcisions caused public outcry. Three schoolgirls were rescued by national government officers. All seven girls were admitted at Embu Level 5 Hospital. The girls are between nine and 11 years old. Embu county commissioner Esther Maina said her office has intensified patrols. She said the practice is degrading, painful and heinous. “FGM does not add any value,” Maina said. She criticised the nurse and girls’ parents. Maina said, “It is immoral for parents to expose their daughters to such suffering.” She said her office, in conjunction with the National Government Affirmative Action Fund, will start a programme to take young girls through alternative rites of passage. The programme will involve counselling girls and their parents on the dangers of FGM.
