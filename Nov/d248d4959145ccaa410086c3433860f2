Only two Jubilee Party members in Migori county assembly on Tuesday turned up to oppose the passing of People's Assembly Bill. The motion, sponsored by NASA was tabled by majority leader and Ragana-Oruba MCA Mallan Ogega. It was unanimously passed as NASA enjoys numerical strength in the assembly. Out of 56 MCAs in the assembly, NASA has 44, followed by seven independents and five Jubilee Party members. Only minority leader and Tagare MCA Nicholas Ngabia and Ntimaru East MCA Augustine Mwera voted against the Bill. They termed the Bill "unconstitutional and illegal". Mwera said the motion was going against the Constitution by building emotions over last presidential poll, when others members of the county voted.
