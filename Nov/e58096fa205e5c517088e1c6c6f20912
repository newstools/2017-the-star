The High Court in Siaya has ordered the IEBC to produce a KIEMS kits by Thursday after former Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo failed to testify in the case. Judge Esther Maina issued the directive after the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission failed to honour the application by Midiwo, the petitioner, who called for the KIEMS kit to be brought to court. Midiwo (pictured) is challenging the election of Elisha Odhiambo. He has sued the IEBC and Gem Returning Officer Martin Omollo. Maina expressed her disappointment after the IEBC tabled SD cards and a tablet, instead of the requisite KIEMS kit as was directed more than a week ago. She demanded that the IEBC produce readable data in three days and reduced  the time allocated for the IEBC to produce its witnesses. The IEBC said failure to  provide the requisite documents  on time was occasioned by the distance of the Safron company, which is based in France.
