The KMPDU has protested over the robbery-murder of a doctor at the Moi Referral Hospital. Dr Mbugua, an intern at the hospital, was found murdered in his house at Elgon View Estate last Sunday by suspected robbers. Some items had been stolen. KMPDU Treasurer Dr Daisy Korir says security agencies in Eldoret must find the killers of 25-year-old Dr Boutrous Waithaka .  She said the murder has caused panic among his colleagues. “We have lost a very young and promising life in Dr Mbugua and this should not go unpunished,” Dr Korir said. She said the hospital should also move quickly to put in place housing facilities for all medical interns who live outside the hospital. A farewell service was held on Wednesday at the hospital (pictured)before the body was moved to Kenyatta University mortuary in Nairobi for burial in Kiambu on Tuesday. The hospital’s service CEO Dr Wilson Aruasa and his Deputy Dr Francis Ogaro said they ensure providing housing and security for all doctors working at the hospital. “We highly regret this incident and the hospital board is in discussion on how to provide housing for doctors on internship and other medics,” Dr Aruasa said. He said the hospital would assist the family in the funeral arrangements. Dr Aruasa said houses to bes used by the doctors at the hospital had been condemned and declared unsafe for human habitation.
