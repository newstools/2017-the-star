National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale yesterday wrote to the Controller of Budget Agnes Odhiambo not to approve money for financing NASA’s People’s Assemblies. In his letter, Duale said the opposition has asked county governments in their strongholds to each contribute at least Sh50 million to support the initiative. “The principles and framework of public finance require openness and accountability. Public money shall be used in a prudent and responsible way,” Duale said. “We, therefore, wish to bring to your attention our concern of the intended irregular expenditure on the initiative,” he said. “It flouts the provisions of Section 12 of the Public Finance Management Act, 2012 on county governments’ responsibilities with respect to the management and control of public finance,” Duale adds. The letter was copied to Treasury Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich and Auditor General Edward Ouko.  Duale told Odhiambo to ensure cash flow and proposed expenditure are in line with approved budgets. At the same time, 10 county assemblies have so far passed the motion seeking to establish the People’s Assemblies. They include Makueni, Kisumu, Busia, Kakamega, Bungoma, Siaya, Migori, Homa Bay and Vihiga. On Wednesday night, Rarieda MP Otiende Amollo said on Citizen TV’s JKL programme the counties are passing the motion that legitimises formation of the People’s Assemblies. The motion emphasises the opposition does not recognise the presidential election held on October 26. A major meeting will be held in Nairobi after assemblies pass the motion.  Amollo said there is no requirement that a majority of the assemblies must pass the motion to be binding nationally.
