The Meru government will introduce a cashless, digital revenue collection system to streamline operations. Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi (pictured) said this will stop corruption cartels, enhance accountability and  integrity. He spoke on Tuesday at a press briefing at the county headquarters in Meru.   Kiraitu urged residents to report revenue  collection officers involved in theft of public funds so disciplinary action is taken against them. There has been a decline in revenue collection. Between 2014 and 2015, Meru collected Sh104 million. For 2015-16, Sh84 million was collected and for the years 2016 and 2017, Sh89 million was collected.
