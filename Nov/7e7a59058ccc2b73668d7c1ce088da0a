Ipoa has been asked  to intervene  in a case in which  two women detained at Syungila AP camp were allegedly brutalised  by  two policemen. Janet Mwikali and Irene Kambua now limp after being beaten on the buttocks and thighs on Wednesday last week. The women were allegedly beaten with rubber whips after being accused of insulting a pastor. But Kambua said  the clergyman framed  them. She said he was bitter they abandoned  his church.   Crusader condemns act Human rights crusader Josphat Kasina on Tuesday visited them and urged Ipoa to act. Kasina, who represents Fida Kenya and the International Commission of Jurists in Kitui, said there is a scheme to cover up  the assault.  “It does not matter whether or not the women were in the wrong, there is no justification for subjecting them to such inhumane beatings. Fida Kenya and the ICJ  will make sure they get  justice,” he said Kasina said the culprits had been transferred to other AP camps. He said the victims had been asked to keep quiet and let the matter be negotiated.   Tricked into withdrawing case Kasina said had it not been for his intervention, the victims would have  been tricked into signing a  document  to withdraw the case recorded under OB60/1/11/2017 at Kitui police station. He also ensured the women were issued a P3 form - a medical report. Last week, Kitui AP commander Benson Wasike said investigations had stopped because the victims had allegedly withdrawn the case. He said it had been referred to the local chief  for settlement. When contacted for comment, Kitui Central OCPD Muthuri Mwongera said the police were discussing the matter.
