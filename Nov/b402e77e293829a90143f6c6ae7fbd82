“Women in Kenya today would rather run to a snake than to a police officer for protection”. That is the sentiment of women at the Coast, who say they are losing faith in the National Police Service because of police brutality against women and children. The Coast Women’s Power, a lobby group, wants the government to investigate officers who clobber women and children during protests.  On Tuesday, police officers, while shooting in the air to disperse NASA supporters who wanted to gather in Jacaranda Grounds in Nairobi, killed seven-year-old Geoffrey Mutinda, who was on a balcony at home. This follows other cases where police shot dead nine-year-old Stephanie Moraa in Mathare and clobbered six-month-old Samantha Pendo to death in Kisumu. The incidents happened during protests against the disputed August 8 General Election. CWP founder and patron Emma Mbura said police have been using excessive force against innocent, weak and unarmed women caught up in demonstrations.  “We have seen women being dragged by their hair by police officers. Are these really Kenyan police officers or people dressed up in police uniform?” said Mbura.
