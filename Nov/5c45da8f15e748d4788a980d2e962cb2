Busia county registered more girls than boys for the KCPE exams that began countrywide on Tuesday, according to the county chief officer for Education and vocational training Dr Joel Barua. Speaking to the Star in Busia, he attributed the increase in enrollment to affirmative action by the county government, which gives girls equal opportunities with the boys. A total of 11,163 girls will sit the exam and 10,674 boys.Teso South leads in girls’ enrollment with 2,083 against 1,953 boys. Barua said he expects about 30 per cent of the candidates, who will fail to gain admission into secondary schools, to join the 18 youth polytechnics in the county, which have robust programmes. “I wish the candidates best of luck and hope the charged political atmosphere in the country will not affect the performance of the candidates. I also don’t expect cheating,” he said.  At Lukonyi Boys Primary School in Matayos, candidates expressed confidence of excelling in the exams. Top candidates Edson Wanyama and Dan Riziki are optimistic of doing well in the exams to enable them pursue careers in medicine.
