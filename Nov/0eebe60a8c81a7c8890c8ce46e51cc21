Youths on Tuesday stormed Vihiga Governor Wilbur Ottichilo’s office demanding that he drop Francis Ominde  as nominee for county secretary. The youths said Ominde, a former Nandi county secretary, lacks integrity. Vihiga Youth Summit spokesman Felix Bulimu said Ominde and the governor come from the same subtribe.  “Through this petition, we are to requesting your office to cancel Francis Ominde’s nomination for the position of county secretary based on the premise of regional balance,” Bulimu said.  Ottichilo and his staff listened as Bulimo read the petition.  He defended Ominde’s nomination, telling the  youths that it was up to MCAs to approve or reject the nominee.  He told  the petitioners to take their grievances to the assembly.
