Former Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero yesterday lost his bid to be joined in a petition challenging Governor Mike Sonko’s win. High Court judge Msagha Mbogholi said Kidero’s application was misconceived and lacked merit. He dismissed the application with costs. “Kidero had enough time within which to file a petition but he did not and further did not give satisfying reasons why he, independently, chose not to challenge the election outcome within the set time,” he ruled. Mbogholi said Kidero needed to file his petition since he had told the court he had new evidence to help in the petition. Kidero’s lawyer Tom Ojienda told Mbogholi on Monday to emulate the Supreme Court, which allowed Thirdway Alliance presidential candidate Ekuru Aukot to be enjoined in a petition challenging President Uhuru Kenyatta’s August 8 win. But through Sonko’s lawyers Harrison Kinyanjui and Cecil Miller, he accused Kidero of trying to challenge his win ‘using the backdoor’. Sonko added that Kidero’s attempt to join the petition as an interested party is prejudicial to him. The IEBC had also opposed Kidero’s application. Kidero had told court he had new evidence to help the court reach a fair judgment. Ojienda said neither Sonko nor the IEBC will suffer prejudice if Kidero is allowed to join the case. The Supreme Court allowed Aukot to be enjoined as an interested party in the presidential petition on grounds he would be affected by the outcome of the case since he was a candidate. But Sonko said Kidero’s application is an afterthought. The IEBC said the application was wanting. Sonko’s lawyers said Kidero’s application will enlarge the original petition.
