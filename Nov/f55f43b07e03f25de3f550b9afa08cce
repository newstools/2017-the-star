 The national U-20 women’s team leave the country this morning for Ghana ahead of their World Cup qualifier match against the hosts on Sunday at Cape Coast Stadium. Under the stewardship of head coach Caroline Ajowi, named a strong traveling party yesterday, will be hoping to get a favourable result in the first round first leg much against their fancied opponents, who beat Algeria in the previous stage. The junior Starlets made the second round of the qualifiers after shaking off Ethiopia in a 4-3 aggregate score-line in the previous round. Ajowi’s charges rallied from two goals down in the first leg of the encounter in Addis Ababa to draw 2-2 courtesy of goals from Soccer Queens’ Corazone Aquino and Maureen Khakasa. In the return match at Kenyatta Stadium, Machakos, Aquino and Gentrix Shikangwa were on target as Starlets recorded a 2-1 win to progress. The team will, however, be hitched by the absence of seven key players who will not make the trip due to school commitments. They include Harriet Nasambu, Beverlin Achieng, Linda Nyongesa, Diana Hashina, Stella Anyango, Sylvia Kapera and Joy Kinglady. In their absence, Ajowi will heavily rely on the experienced Aquino for goals as well as leadership as she wears the captain’s armband. The team is expected back on Tuesday and head straight to camp in anticipation for the return leg to be played on November 18 at Kenyatta Stadium, Machakos.
