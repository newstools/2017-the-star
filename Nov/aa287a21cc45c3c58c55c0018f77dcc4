Kisumu county secretary Olang'o Onudi has raised the alarm over a racket out to swindle residents by promising them jobs. Onudi distanced himself from the conmen and asked job seekers to be alert and not give anybody cash to secure employment. The secretary said the county has asked police to look into two numbers used to solicit bribes from unsuspecting people. He added that those behind the cartel have been sending messages to people, including senior county officers, for the past three weeks. "The numbers are 0753 582098 and 0743 109227. I have never asked anybody to do me a favour in order to be employed by the county government," he said. "These are thugs who should be in their rightful place. I assure the public police will arrest them." He spoke on Thursday amid outcry by residents who said they had lost large amounts of money. Onudi noted the county advertises jobs for competitive recruitment. "Governor Anyang Nyong'o's administration is focused on equity, equality and inclusivity and will not tolerate any nepotism and corruption," he said. "We have put in place measures to ensure people are employed on competence, integrity and academic qualifications, not through bribery." The former Kenya Medical Training College director urged county staff to uphold professionalism and integrity so residents get quality services. Onudi also served as health executive under Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga before being appointed Kisumu secretary. Read: Nyong'o appoints ex-KMTC boss Olang'o Onudi acting Kisumu secretary
