A lone wildebeest who had braved the Mara River after its waters killed hundreds of members of its herd, saw the circle of life take yet another cruel turn when it was killed by an angry bull hippo. Hundreds of wildebeest were seen lying dead on the banks of the river in Maasai Mara National Reserve, Kenya, during the first seasonal crossing.  Whilst one wildebeest managed to ride out the stampede to cross which had killed many of its herd, it was then attacked by an angry hippo in the water.  Despite surviving the stampede, the poor animal did not stand a chance against an an angry bull hippo in the water.  Too late: Within seconds, it came face to face with a huge, and less than pleased, bull hippo./DAILY MAIL The wildebeest live on the Serengeti plains of southeastern Africa and migrate in an enormous loop crossing the borders of  Kenya and Tanzania. The mass movement of more than 1.2million animals is recognized as one of the 'Wonders of the Natural World.' And every year, hundreds die as the huge herds cross the Mara River. Some succumb to the currents, others are trampled in the melee as they cross or unable to make it up the steep river bank, while others are eaten by crocodiles.
