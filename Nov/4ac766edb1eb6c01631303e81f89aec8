A petition against Homa Bay Governor Cyprian Awiti was adjourned for more 30 minutes after his supporters and those of his rival Oyugi Magwanga clashed. Former Kasipul MP Magwanga is challenging Awiti’s win .There was commotion outside Homa Bay High Court morning. A war of words erupted beween the groups, made up of mainly youth, who overpowered security guards and entered the court compound. Both groups were chanting their campaign slogans and the nicknames they used while supporting Magwanga and Awiti during the election. They shouted ‘Tiachaa! Tiachaa! for Magwanga, while Awiti’s supporters chanted “Akuba! Akuba!” When lawyers Charles Kanjama (for Magwanga) and Tom Ojienda (for Awiti) arrived in the court, they were jeered. Kanjama requested justice Joseph Karanja to tell their clients to talk to their supporters to keep calm. Ojienda concurred with Kanjama. The judge ordered for a break.  Karanja said he may move be court if the noisy supporters are not controlled.
