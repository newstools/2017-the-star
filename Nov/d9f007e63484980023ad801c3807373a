Former LSK CEO Apollo Mboya now wants the court of appeal to explain the controversial orders suspending Justice George Odunga judgement on the unlawful gazettement of returning officers by IEBC.  In a letter to the Chief Registrar Anne Amadi, Mboya wants access to information from the court appeal on how they issued the orders on a Public holiday.  He further wants to know why the court of appeal was open on a public holiday and further wants to know if the registry was open on that particular day and by whose authority.  He also wants to know why Judges from Nairobi were not empaneled to hear the matter but instead Judges who are from Kisumu, Nyeri and Malindi were empannelled.. He claims that Justice E. Githinji is based in Kisumu, Fatuma Sichale from Nyeri while Martha Koome is based in Malindi.  "What criteria was used to empanel the bench that heard the case and who did it" Mboya asks.  He further wants information on how the court could deal with the matter expeditiously exparte when there are many other matters that are still pending at the court with no hearing dates.  Mboya who has also copied the letter to Chief Justice David Maraga says he wants a response to his letter three days after it is received. Last week the court of appeal registrar responded to Mboya's allegations saying that the court did indeed sit on October 25 and all the three judges were present and wrote notes of the proceedings.  Mboya had claimed in a series of tweets that the registry staff were being forced to backdate the appeal filed at the court by IEBC lawyers.  In the case, Justice Odunga had ruled that the gazettement of the RO and PO was illegal but the court of appeal suspended the Judgement on the eve of the repeat presidential elections.  Justices Koome , Sichale and Githinji issued the orders after IEBC moved to appeal judge Odunga's decision.
