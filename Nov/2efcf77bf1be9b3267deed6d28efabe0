Religious leaders in Bungoma have eulogised Bishop Cornelius Korir as a fighter for democracy who spoke out against Kanu repression. Korir, 67, died on Monday after collapsing in Eldoret. Lead by ACK Bishop George Mechumo, they said xx on Wednesdayxx Korir will be greatly missed for helping the church keep the government on its toes to serve the wananchi. Mechumo said they were shocked by his death "as the bishop was greatly needed at this time when the country is in political turmoil". He also said Korir was famous in the days when groups like Mwakenya, February 18 FERA had opposed the Kanu regime that made life unbearable. Korir is greatly remembered for issuing firm statements when the clergy met in those days, Mechumo said. "I remember the Bishop when we were under Moi's rule and many groups were fighting for Kenyan's' rights and wanted to overthrow the government," he said. Korir also was accompanied by distinguished Catholic priests. Bishop Korir also tried to bring together near-warring communities in Kitale and help them live in harmony. "We are placing his soul in the God’s hands." Mechumo also asked politicians from across the political divide to preach healing and reconciliation. "We are on our knees as a church, praying for a long-lasting solution that will bring peace to the country," he said.
