The completion of the first phase of the project will stretch 2.7 kilometres between Prestige Plaza and Kenya Library. The project’s first phase is being built by Japanese firm World Kaihatsu Kogyo Ltd for Sh1.4 billion. It is 22 per cent complete. It was funded through a grant from the Japanese government. The expansion includes building a four-vehicle lane and service roads, as well as pedestrian and bicycle lanes. A special lane will be built for public service buses. Automated traffic lights will be installed at major intersections.
