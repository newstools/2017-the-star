Kamene Goro has called it quits at Ebru TV. The screen siren told Word Is she quit the station two weeks ago. "I left, heading to greener pastures. I just felt like Ebru wasn't the Ebru that I fell in love with. It was a career and at the same time, it was becoming a bit difficult working there." When asked whether the station had been facing problems with its employees, Kamene was reluctant and did not want to answer. "I don't believe any workplace is perfect but one of my colleagues, Doreen, also left." We can confirm that Kamene will be gracing the TV screens once again and is set to make her debut in one of the biggest TV stations. A close source told Word Is employees there have been underpaid, which has led to some of them calling it quits. "People are highly underpaid over there. When that isn't enough, there are problems, there are a lot of things that are happening within the station. A few problems in the working environment can make it a bit difficult... It's not all rosey," our source whispered. Our source says this problem is not affecting the entertainment productions like Pierra Makena's Let's Talk show.
