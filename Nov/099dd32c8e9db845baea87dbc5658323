Hundreds of youths on Saturday held protests in Kirinyaga against the move by a Chinese construction company to import labour from outside the county. The youths accused Shanga Construction Ltd of discrimination revealing that none of the locals who applied got have been employed at the site. The firm was engaged by the national government to construct the Kiaga-Kabare-Kiandieri road. Kerugoya ward MCA Kamau Murango led the demos which saw the youths barricade the Kerugoya-Kutus road paralysing transport. They also disrupted business at the company's main site and chased away employees from outside the county. The lot said they will ensure no construction commences until they are given jobs. Murango warned that he will not allow the company to discriminate against his people. He revealed that already the company has employed over 100 casual workers, all of them are from outside the county. "The company must first consider the locals when it comes to jobs before getting other people from other counties." Murango, who is Kirinyaga county assembly Majority Leader, said the county government will not allow the company to import labour. "We have hundreds of jobless youths who are languishing in poverty," he said. The demonstrators waved placards and twigs before they were calmed by Murango who urged them to be peaceful.
