Nakumatt Supermarkets’ main branch in Eldoret, on Uganda Road, has been closed over Sh21 million rent arrears. The landlord, Eldo Center, a company associated with a former minister, said they had repossessed the premises. A notice pinned on the supermarket’s doors said the repossession took effect on November 3. The owner said Nakumatt will be allowed entry to remove its goods. Eldoret West OCPD Samuel Mutunga said they had received a copy of the notice.  Managers and workers at the supermarket were caught unawares. None of the senior workers was willing to comment. The branch employs more than 200 workers. Nakumatt has another branch on Ronald Ngala Street which remains in operation
