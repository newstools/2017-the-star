The National Housing Corporation is set to develop over 6,000 housing units across eight counties over the next three years. The first 5,000 units will be in Uasin Gishu’s Eldoret town, Stoni Athi in Machakos and Changamwe in Mombasa county. The remaining 1,000 units will be in Taita Taveta’s Voi town, Kericho, Kisumu, Meru and Nyeri counties. “We will roll-out this countrywide project independently through partnerships in an effort to increase stock of new houses,” NHC board chairman Francis Gitau said, presenting a Sh27.7 million dividend cheque to the Treasury Cabinet secretary Henry Rotich on Wednesday. The dividend is from the corporation’s 2015/2016 fiscal year that saw it report a pre-tax profit of Sh338.9 million that was achieved on the back of increased sale of houses, lending and improvement in operational efficiencies. NHC has been paying dividends to the exchequer since 2003 to support the government’s budgetary allocations. Rotich thanked NHC for the donation and pledged to support the corporation’s growth strategy that is aligned to the third medium term plan of the country’s Vision 2030 economic blueprint. At the same time, his Transport, Infrastructure, Housing and Urban Development counterpart James Macharia said the ministry is planning to launch an 8,000 middle-class housing unit in Mavoko, Machakos county, next month. This is part of the government’s plan to build at least 200,000 housing units every year for the next five years in a bid to seal the huge housing deficit in the country, estimated at 1.8 million units.
