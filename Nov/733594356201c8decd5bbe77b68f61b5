The 28 children who suffered paralysis because of an injection they received at Akichelesit Dispensary  in 2016 will be compensated, Busia MCAs agreed on Wednesday. Malaba South Ward MCA David Kokonya moved the motion to compensate the children and the family of a woman from Sio Port who died because of delayed delivery. “Mr Speaker, some families are traumatised  because the incidents,” Kokonya said while moving the motion. “ I want to see  justice  done. The Akichelesit children suffered irrecoverable damage while the family of the Sio Port woman, who died with her twins due to slow response from medics, is also suffering,” the MCA said. After a  heated debate, members unanimously agreed on compensation. The Legal and Human Affairs committee was mandated to come up with realistic compensation packages.
