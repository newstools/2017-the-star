Nairobi Water’s women are up in arms after being locked out of the next week’s East and Central Africa Club Championship in Tanzania, where they were set to defend the title. The team’s coach Jack Ochieng said it’s unfortunate that the management can’t facilitate the club to the annual event after flying the company’s flag high in the region. Nairobi Water have successfully won the championship three times in a row. He said: “It hurts that we will not be part and parcel of the event, which starts next week in Dar es salaam. The players feel unappreciated for their efforts.” He added: “While we appreciate the fact that the company may be going through financial constraints, they should have communicated and just maybe, we would have had a way out. Players are on my case to find out why we are not participating in the event and some are keen to contribute their own cash just to feature in the event but we are way past confirmation date. It’s now clear that we wont participate in the event. It really it hurts.”  The women’s national team coach said they will focus on defending the national league. “There is little we can do now but to switch our focus to the league. This weekend we have a tie against fast-raising Divas and as much as the players are not in good spirits, we hope to stage a good match against them and complete a double, having won against them in the first leg,” said Ochieng. Water won 30-18 in the first leg at the Kaloleni grounds. KHF fixture secretary Charles Omondi, however, noted four local clubs have confirmed their participation in the regional event. They include Black Mamba, National Cereals and Produce Board (men and women) and Strahmore University (men).
