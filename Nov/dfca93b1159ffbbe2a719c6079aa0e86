The University Academic Staff Union yesterday announced the start of a countrywide lecturers’ strike at all public universities, citing failure by the government to implement the 2013-17 CBA. Secretary general Constantine Wasonga said they will boycott work until their grievances are addressed. He spoke in Nairobi. Wasonga said only three universities have adhered to the agreement and are paying their staff the new rates. He said it is unfortunate the other 26 universities have failed to implement the CBA. “Twenty-six universities have blatantly refused to implement the negotiated new rates. I want to tell our members to down their tools forthwith,” Wasonga said. Universities that have implemented the new negotiated rates are Jaramogi Oginga Odinga University of Science and Technology, Chuka University and Machakos University. Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology and Karatina University had implemented the new rates, but later reverted to old rates. Lecturers have been asked to stay away from the learning institutions. Learning in the universities is expected to resume on Thursday after a short election break. The government had released Sh10 billion after lecturers went on strike early this year.  The union said the money was used to cater for arrears, but could not sustain the new rates.
