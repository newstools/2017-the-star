An AFP photographer arrested at the weekend at Brookside Dairies farm will take his plea tomorrow. Chief photographer Yasuyoshi Chiba is charged with trespassing on private land. He is accused of going into the farm in Kiambu county last Friday without authority from management. Seven people have been listed as witnesses. Chiba was presented in court yesterday but did not take a plea. Haron Ndubi said the charges against him are extreme and he would make submissions.  Ndubi also applied for the photographer's passport to be deposited with the court, which senior principal magistrate Stella Atambo granted. The police had held on to the passport. Atambo also granted Ndubi's plea for the Sh10,000 police bail posted to remain as the court bail until hChibae takes a plea.
