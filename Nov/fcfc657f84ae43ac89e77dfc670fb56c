Irate youths on Saturday disrupted a drug and alcohol sensitisation meeting in Imenti, claiming it was meant to do away with cheap liquor. The drunk youths questioned area MCA and Meru county executive for youth and sports Daniel Kiogora about their plans for cheap alcohol in the area. The two had organised the meeting. The drama ensued when Kiogora rose to speak. The youths demanded that he should not speak about bhang. Kiogora said drug abuse had destroyed youths in the area. He said it had led to poverty, school dropouts and even male dysfunction. “We have embarked on sensitization, because this must come to an end. We will continue to talk to them. We also urge residents to support our fight against bhang and second-generation alcohol,” Kiogora said.
