The body of a 40-year-old woman was retrieved from a septic tank in Tala market, Machakos county, on Thursday. The body of the unidentified person was discovered by residents who notified police in Matungulu sub-county Tala OCS James Njiiri said the victim's hands had been tied with a rope. He said police took the body to Kangundo Hospital mortuary and launched investigations. Njiiri asked those with septic tanks to ensure they are properly covered, especially during the rainy season, to prevent accidents. He added residents who have dug holes should cover them since rain waters will fill them, posing more danger.
