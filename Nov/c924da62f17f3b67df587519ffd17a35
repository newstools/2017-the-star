members of the opposite sex thus limiting him from celebrating with
his female relatives and his younger uncircumcised siblings. "I am very happy over this result. Though I knew I was going to perform, I didn't expect this result. How I wish I could celebrate with my mum and dad who have been an inspiration," he said on Tuesday. Kiprotich, 14, said he would like to do aeronautical engineering after finishing secondary school. His parents, Samuel and Florence Sigilai, said their son is self-driven and always took his academic work seriously. "Unlike other kids, who have to be pushed to read, the boy was always
busy with his books and his hard work has paid off. As a family we are
proud of him," Samuel said. "I am very happy for my son. I wish I could hug him and congratulate him
for his success but now I can't access him. Nonetheless we are planning
grand celebrations for him once he is out," Florence said. Kiprotich will be reunited with his family in mid-December. Education CS Fred Matiang'i released results on Tuesday saying the highest candidate scored 455 marks. "All candidates with more than 400 marks will be placed in national schools without discrimination. There was more seriousness of our candidates than last year," he said.
