Lamu West MP Stanley Muthama (pictured) has called on leaders and residents in all the counties near the Boni Forest in Lamu to preach peace and co-existence. The counties are Tana River and Garissa. Muthama said the three counties face similar challenges, including insecurity caused by the constant threat of al Shabaab and pastoralist-farmer conflicts. Speaking in Lamu yesterday, the MP said he believes unity among leaders and residents will go a long way in ensuring success of the ongoing security operation to flush out al Shabaab militants from the Boni Forest. The legislator said with cohesion among communities, insecurity will become a thing of the past. Leaders from the three counties recently met in Malindi to try and chart a way forward on how to ensure cohesion.
