Muslim clerics are concerned that billions of shillings were lost during the election period. The Council of Imams and Preachers of Kenya said businesses have suffered and people have lost and will lose jobs. Addressing journalists yesterday at their Tana River office, acting chairman Abdhulahi Gubo said fear and uncertainty have gripped the nation because of political tension. Organising secretary Mohamed Khalifa congratulated President Uhuru Kenyatta on his reelection. He also praised the IEBC for a smooth presidential rerun. As students sit the KCPE exam, Khalifa appealed to Kenyans to maintain peace to ensure the candidates’ safety.  “Let us be mindful of the children’s welfare.  “Let the candidates have an environment in which to sit the examination,” Khalifa said.
