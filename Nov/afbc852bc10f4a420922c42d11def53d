Book: Sula Author:  Toni Morrison Genre: African-American literature Publisher: Alfred A Knopf   In this rich, brilliant second novel by 1993 Nobel Prize in Literature winner Toni Morrison, the author delves into the Negro community of 1919-65, with a keener focus on the lives of two young black girls, Nel and Sula.  The two meet as children in the small town of Medallion, Ohio, and despite their different backgrounds, soon become the very best of friends.  They share their deepest secrets, dreams as well as highs and lows. Nel opts to stay in medallion, marries a man called Jude and starts a family, while Sula leaves for the city, but eventually returns to her hometown a rebellious, wayward, sexual seductress of the husbands of medallion. The women of the town grow to loathe Sula’s presence and her friendship with Nel becomes somewhat strained. Both women must suffer the consequences of their actions.  The love and friendship they shared since childhood faces an unforgivable betrayal when Nel discovers her husband with Sula. It is only when Nel visits Sula on her deathbed that she realises that all those years, what she missed was not her husband but the companionship of her best friend.  This is one novel that will take you on a roller-coaster of emotions and is well-packed with humour, affection, sorrow, sensuality and raw beauty.  I was left feeling somewhat melancholic by the tragedy at the end, coupled with the way it was so beautifully crafted in rich poetic tones. As a big fan of Toni Morrison, this is one highly moving novel I could not put down once I started reading it. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a culturally rich, beautifully worded novel on the day-to-day lives of the black community of years past.   Star Rating: 4/5
