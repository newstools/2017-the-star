Awendo residents have called on elected leaders in Migori county to ensure the market road, which was the centre of the August 8 election campaign pledges, is maintained and upgraded. The road has been impassable due to heavy rains. On Thursday, residents said the road should be turned into a banana plantation because the mud has caused traffic snarlups. “We have had to deal with this bad road for the last five years and during the last campaigns, we were given the same pledge about maintainance. We just want elected leaders to help us,” Peter Okinyi, a boda boda rider, said. Ooki Omudi, the patron of Amoya Youth Group, said since the rains started, residents have had to repair their bikes often and their customer base has been dwindling. He said the owners of stalls and business premises have been making losses.
