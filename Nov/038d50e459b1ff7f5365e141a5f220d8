Mwingi north MP Paul Nzengu has thanked Mwingi north residents for the act they did last week for not killing the Tana river herders camels and instead took them to police station. Speaking to the press in Mwingi Nzengu congratulated his constituents for adhering to what they decided in a security meeting last month that there will be no retaliation mission.  "We want to make sure that there is no more shedding of blood and that these bandits vacate the locals area since they cannot force themselves and kill the locals," said Nzengu.  The bandits who pretend to be herders always make sure that they tamper with residents farms so that they don't harvest anything and they refer to the locals crops as grass. Nzengu said he is happy that 103 camels with one attendant were taken to the police station by the locals after they found them grazing in their farms. The bandits have killed over 35 people in two years. The camels from Tana river herders were grazing in the locals farm on Monday of last week at Mandongoi area of Mwingi north constituency. He said the Somali herders graze their camels in the locals farms by force but now the locals have decided that they will not kill any camel but they will be taking them to police station for further action together with their owners.  The bandits who pose as herders have for the last two years killed over 35 locals especially in Kasiluni area and Mandongoi. "I urge the administration to make sure the residents will get maximum protection from police since these bandits are always ready for retaliation mission. The bandits always make sure that they tamper with residents farms so that they don't harvest anything. It's painful to hear them refer to locals crops as grass, " added Nzengu.  He promised the residents that there will be a lasting solution to this perennial problem especially during the rainy season when farmers have embarked on planting their seeds.
