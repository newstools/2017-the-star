The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission yesterday indicated it may drop some lawyers from the team that represented it in the August presidential petition. Senior Counsel Paul Muite led a team of high-flying lawyers that represented the agency at the legal battle in the Supreme Court. The team lost the battle as the court nullified the election and ordered a fresh one to be conducted within 60 days. A new petition has been filed at the court challenging President Uhuru Kenyatta’s victory in the repeat election conducted in October. IEBC is seeking to strengthen the legal team that will represent it in the new case. The Star has established that the commission has held two plenary meetings after the disputed repeat presidential election to review the performance of its legal team. Two IEBC commissioners yesterday told the Star, separately, that the electoral body will overhaul its legal department and review engagement with both internal and external lawyers. “There have been clear instances of sabotage. We must cure this as we anticipate another presidential petition,” one of the commissioners said. He said performance of some lawyers was wanting and blamed it for the commission’s loss in the August 8 presidential petition. “It was rather obvious that we had glaring contradictions in our defence team,” he said. Another commissioner also said the commission had raised concern over the dismal performance of their lawyers. “Performance is an issue we have deliberated on for some time, however, time may not be on our side to conclusively address this matter,” the commissioner said. “We may not take any chances, our legal team must be strengthened,” the commissioner added. In the August petition, Muite was assisted by Kamau Karori, Paul Nyamodi and PLO Lumumba. IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati was represented by lawyer Peter Wanyama.
