One thing that has always touched me is when people help those in need. Many people know the biblical parable of the good Samaritan. The question we all need to ask ourselves in this current time is, are we safari Samaritans?  What on earth do I mean by that? Well, when people travel in the bush, they are often not prepared, and sometimes inexperienced for whatever could happen while away from the city. A fairly recent example has been the heavy rains we had this month. Many people have been stuck in many places, due to flooding and very thick, sticky “black cotton” mud.  The KWS sometimes uses a tractor to pull people’s cars out, but there is a dedicated group of regular members of Fonnap (Friends of Nairobi National Park) who are well prepared for most situations.  It is great to be part of this group, as we coordinate through social media to pull vehicles out of the mud, using practical experience. Those who help sometimes become covered in mud, but they don’t complain. Instead, they are just glad to be able to help, without expecting anything in return. This is what defines being a safari Samaritan. Are you prepared for any bush incident? Do you have equipment like a jack, towropes, flashlights, water, or first aid kits in your vehicle?  It is also good to have the KWS contact numbers for the area you are in. For the Nairobi National Park, the contact hotline numbers are 0800597000 or 08002215566 or 0202587435 or 0729125502. In life, it is always good to plan to be prepared to help others. We never know when we will also need someone to help us.
