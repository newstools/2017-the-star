Jacky Vike, known to many as the onscreen quirky character Awinja, spoke about her baby daddy. The actress was rumoured to be dating Churchill Show's Sleepy David after they were spotted kissing at an event. Awinja rubbished these claims like yesterday's smelly garbage saying, "My baby daddy is not someone in the limelight as many are speculating. The love of my life is Kenyan."  We can confirm that her main man is one Alfred Ngachi, an executive creative director of Sync Media. The Papa Shirandula star recently took to social media to tell fans how the man has been her support system. "Respect to all men that support their partners with newborns, those nights are never easy, but with a little help it goes a loooooong way. Fan's gave their reactions. Wholesome_lifeisneeded wrote, "Also respect to the mothers that don't try to sabotage the organic relationship between the father and the child via child support and disruptive custody issues. Many men are falsely called deadbeats later." Chris_254 added, "Me? Change the diapers? At night? NEVER.. Not happening!!" carol_is_bae concluded, "Such men died in World War 2."
