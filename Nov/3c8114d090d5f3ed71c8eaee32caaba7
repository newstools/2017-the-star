Chairman of the Council of Governors Josphat Nanok led his colleagues, MPs and political leaders from Rift Valley in attending a special Mass for Bishop Cornelius Korir in Eldoret yesterday. The service was held at the Sacred Heart Cathedral where Korir will be buried on Saturday, after a funeral service at the Eldoret Sports Club. Nanok was with Governors Jackson Mandago (Uasin Gishu) Joyce Laboso (Bomet), Stephen Sang (Nandi), Stanley Kiptis (Baringo) and Alex Tolgos (Elgeyo Marakwet). Several MPs from the region were also present. Nanok asked leaders to emulate Korir by preaching peace and serving Kenyans with dedication. “We do not need politics that will divide this country. We lead the counties and we shall remain united,” he said.
