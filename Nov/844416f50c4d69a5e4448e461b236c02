The Coast will benefit more from the Jubilee administration after President Uhuru is sworn in on Tuesday, Tourism CS Balala has said. Former Mombasa Senator Hassan Omar is widely expected to be given a Cabinet position. Speaking on Monday after the Supreme Court upheld Uhuru’s October 26 victory, Balala said Jubilee supporters at the Coast worked hard for the  win and will be rewarded.  “The Coast  will be in President Uhuru’s government,” Balala said. On Wednesday, Muslim clerics asked Uhuru to reward Coast people with senior positions in government. Kenya Muslim National Advisory Council said they deserve more CS, PS and ambassadorial positions. The council said Jubilee supporters remained loyal despite being in a NASA stronghold. “We want to lay ground for more support in 2022,” Kemnac chairman Sheikh Juma Ngao said on the phone. The cleric urged Uhuru to give the opposition big jobs like he did after the 2013 General Election. “Don’t pick opposition leaders for plum jobs. It demoralises your supporters who are loyal to you,” Ngao told Uhuru. In 2013, Uhuru appointed then Malindi MP Dan Kazungu Mining CS. This was seen as a move to weaken the opposition. Kazungu is said to be jittery after the Star revealed there will be a major Cabinet reshuffle and he may find himself out. Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho and his Kilifi counterpart Amason Kingi have called for secession.  They say the Coast has been marginalised economically and politically. Balala dismissed the call as a creation of the two leaders for them to remain relevant in politics. The CS said the Coast is a key investment hub for the country especially in the tourism sector.
