Muhoroni Youth are doing everything within their means as they seek to save their fast capsizing vessel. In a troubled season where firing and hiring of coaches has been their biggest talk point, the club has once again orchestrated a change of guard at the top. The latest move, akin to kicks of a dying horse, Muhoroni have demoted their interim manager, James ‘Odijo’ Omondi, and hired a replacement in Jeff Odongo. Muhoroni have had their, arguably, turbulent season ever since they were promoted to the elite league five years ago. With four matches remaining for the Got Alila-based club to wrap the season, the acquisition of Odongo is seen as the last option in grabbing the 12 points which would at least grant them survival if their closest challengers Western Stima and Thika United falter. The little known Odongo, who served the club as the team manager before his elevation, is set to commence his coaching duties this evening against Kariobangi Sharks at Moi International Sports Centre Kasarani. Odongo, a CAF ‘C’ licence holder, will be deputized by Omondi and Ebrahim Ateng. It is believed the heavy 6-2 home loss to Bandari on Wednesday triggered the change of guard and its effectiveness will be put to question against Sharks today. According to a communiqué club’s official website, the appointment of the new coach is geared towards orchestrating what would be a miraculous safeguarding of their top flight status. “We have appointed Jeff Odongo as the head coach replacing James Omondi who will now serve as one of his assistants.” The club has managed five wins, shared spoils 10 times and lost 15 encounters. They sit at the bottom of the standings with 25 points.
