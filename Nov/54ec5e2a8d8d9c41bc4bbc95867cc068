Pastoralists in Garissa county are not yet off the hook despite short rains in some parts of county last week. Area National Drought and Management Authority coordinator Abdinoor Dubow said the rains were only in some parts of Fafi, Dadaab and Ijara constituencies. Balambala and Lagdera subcounties have not receives rains. The drought has lasted for more than one year. Hundreds of livestock have died. Some pastoralists have crossed over to Somalia and Ethiopia in search of water and pasture. “We need at least a minimum of two weeks for grass to regenerate into pasture,” Dubow said. Garissa county commissioner James Kianda said the national government, the county administration and other aid agencies have scaled up water trucking to subcounties that are worst-hit. “The military have joined to provide water in Masalani, Modogashe, Fafi,” he said. Kianda said distribution of relief food is going on alongside vaccination of livestock all meant to mitigate the effects of the biting drought.
