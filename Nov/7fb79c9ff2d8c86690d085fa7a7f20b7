The Nairobi Securities Exchange has partnered with Nasdaq Dubai to facilitate the development of a Sukuk sector in Kenya. A Memorandum of Understanding signed by the two exchanges will see both collaborate to assist the Kenyan government, government entities and private businesses issue and list Sukuk on the Nairobi Bourse. “Nasdaq Dubai looks forward to supporting the Nairobi Securities Exchange, the Kenyan government and the country’s capital markets community as they develop a thriving Sukuk sector,” Nasdaq Dubai chief executive Hamed Ali said during the signing. He added that through sharing expertise in the Sukuk sector, the Dubai bourse was supporting the growth of Islamic finance in Kenya. In the 2017/18 budget reading, the government unveiled a number of initiatives aimed at developing Islamic finance including the issuance of Islamic bonds, or sukuk, as an alternative source of government funds to drive infrastructure development.
