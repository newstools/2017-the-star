Thirty-three families worst-affected by post-election clashes in Kawangware have been given Sh50,000 each to restart their lives. The Kenya Red Cross Society Monday said it wired the cash directly to the victims. Clashes broke out in Kawangware over the weekend following last week’s repeat presidential election. Two people were killed, scores injured and houses burnt. In the disbursement on Monday at Kabiru Community Library in Kawangware, the families received cash via M-Pesa. “These are children, women and men without a roof above them as they could not salvage much from their houses,” Kenya Red Cross Secretary General Abbas Gullet said. He was speaking on Monday in Kawangware. He said he expect the families to be able to pay three-months rent at alternative shelters as they reorganise their lives. “Cash is dignified and allows families to prioritise their needs and take full charge of their recovery process,” Gullet said.
