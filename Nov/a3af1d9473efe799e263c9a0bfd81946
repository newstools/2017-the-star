Raila Odinga is scheming to isolate his co-principals in order to become opposition leader, Kiambu Governor Waititu Babayao and speaker Stephen Ndichu have said. Waititu said he knows Raila all too well from his days as a new political entrant and the NASA principal is untrustworthy. “When we relocated with my mother from here (Limuru), we settle in Kibra. So I know Raila so well, because when he vied and became Lang’ata MP I was there and I later vied for Embakasi MP. One thing is that when Raila tells you to sit down, just rise up and vise versa,” he said. Waititu and Ndichu spoke at new county secretary Martin Njogu’s dowry ceremony (ngurario) in Bibirioni ward, Limuru subcounty, on Saturday. Waititu said the products boycott is a ploy to get rid of and silence his co-principals. “When he tells you to take this route, he basically means use another route. So what he wants to do is not to mislead us, but Kalonzo [Musyoka], [Moses] Wetang’ula and [Musalia] Mudavadi. He wants to get rid of the pact they had agreed upon before the election,” he said. Ndichu said Raila’s supporters should also stop using water supplied to Nairobi from Ruiru Dam in Githunguri, Sasumwa Dam in Nyandarua and Ndakaini Dam in Murang’a. He said the roads to Western, the SGR, Kenya Airways runways and electricity in NASA’s strongholds were all initiated by and belong to the Jubilee administration. “We were threatened by the Whites and we defeated them, so Raila’s threats are empty and [President] Uhuru has been appointed by God,” he said.
