An executive nominee in Migori county was turned away during vetting on Thursday over a "technical hitch". Sheila Ghati has been nominated to head the Public Administration docket, which she held in the previous administration. Appointments Committee chairman speaker Boaz Okoth did not explain the technical hitch. Members spotted a technicality in her papers, raising questions how she served in Obado’s first administration. "...we didn’t even go ahead to interview her. We told her to first solve the issue from the executive side,” Okoth said. The committee finalised the vetting of the other nine nominees. Okoth said they will vet Ghati later. Vice chairman North Kanyamkago MCA George Omamba said the committee will retreat to write a report for each member, which will be tabled sometime next week. The nominees are Elijah Odhiambo (Lands), Elizabeth Ochaye (Trade and Tourism), Isca Oluoch (Health), Kephas Nyamita (Environment and Disaster Management), Moses Chamwada (Public works), Rebecca Ghati (Water and Energy), Samson Maginga (Education, Culture, Sports), Scholarstica Abiero (Finance) and Valentine Ogongo (Agriculture.
