The NGO Board uses its powers selectively and with open political bias. Registration is a year long thing, so why does it strike only when unregistered entities that operate on names of convenience are perceived to be about to rock the establishment boat? NGO Board CEO Fazul Mhahamed has written to lawyer George Kegoro in his capacity as the vice-chairman of the Kenya National Human Rights Commission directing him to cease funding Kura Yangu Sauti Yangu and We-the-People. Mahamed says SYKY these entities operate without certificates of registration, contrary to the law. This move against the NGOs is reminiscent of another crackdown by the Board just ahead of the presidential petition case in September. Is the Nairobi Business Community, a government-friendly outfit, a registered entity? It is wrong for the NGO Board, whose CEO’s standing has been questioned by many NGOs, to act as a tool of the government. Civil society NGOs perform a useful function in the governance field, despite the government finding them to be an irritant.
