A Nairobi-based software development firm has introduced a new software to assist landlords and property managers to manage properties, tenants and leases digitally. The firm, Kodisher Solution, says the software is a web-based application aimed at enhancing efficiency in the real estate and property industry. While using the platform, the landlords are required to create accounts on the system after which they can add and manage properties, tenants and leases. The application also has a comprehensive financial management component that will help landlords simplify and possibly automate financial record-keeping. The two big disruptions introduced by the Kodisher software are digitisation and online hosting. “With this, landlords can move away from physical files and store all lease documents, invoices, receipt books and repair documents in digital format. Online hosting will give property managers the freedom to work from any computer that has an internet connection and be able to access all their information and manage their properties, finances and operations,” a statement said. Property managers will also be able to share access to accounts with colleagues and landlords in a move that is likely to simplify necessary monthly reporting and enhance accountability to property owners.
