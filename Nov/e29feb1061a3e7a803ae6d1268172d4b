Tea farmers from Makomboki tea factory in Kigumo subcounty, Murang’a, engaged in fistfights after they disagreed on who was to chair the AGM on Wednesday. A court order was issued on Tuesday barring the directors from chairing the meeting. It directed KTDA regional manager Willis Odhiambo to take over instead. Some farmers, however, rejected the regional manager, saying he is neither a director nor a shareholder and it is illegal for him to chair the meeting. Another faction supported the regional manager and accused their rivals of wanting to delay the AGM. The farmers descended on each other with blows after engaging in a heated shouting match. Police officers had a hard time stopping the farmers, who said the factory is being mismanaged. The agenda of the meeting was read and passed as farmers shouted each other down.
