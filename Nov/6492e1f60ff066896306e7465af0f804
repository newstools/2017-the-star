Communities living in Samburu county have been urged to cooperate with statistical officers to provide credible data for economic and social planning. County commissioner Wilfred Kinyua said the national and county governments as well as NGOs use data collected from families to identify the needs of Kenyans. “This data is very important as government plans on how to deliver quality services and address the needs of people in education, health, agriculture and security areas,” he said. Samburu county statistics officer Samuel Leparsaiya (pictured) said high levels of illiteracy are a challenge. The two addressed the press in Maralal town. Kinyua said, “I advise people who find it hard to give information to our officers that when you give accurate information about your family, you are helping yourself. ”
