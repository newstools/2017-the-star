Kericho Gold
Teas were awarded during the Hospitality Qatar 2017 exhibition in
Doha last week. The brand showcased
its green and black teas which are blended and packaged at its
Mombasa-based factory from fine teas in Kenya and carefully selected
by expert Tea Tasters for the richness of their taste, flavour and
aroma. Kericho Gold's win
is a vote of confidence to Kenya's black tea in the Arab market
currently dominated by China, India and Sri Lanka who are riviling
Kenya in term of production. Latest global tea
production estimate show that China produced 2.4 billion kilogrammes
last year followed by India 1.2 billion. Kenya produced 450 million
kilogrammes and exported 25 per cent of it to the world. Kericho Gold is the
best quality of teas available in the market and purely blended from
Kenya. We are glad to share the rich aroma with the world,'' said
Gold Crown Beverages director Naveed Ariff Gold Crown Beverages
introduced Kericho Gold black and green tea ranges in Qatar early
this year and now available in more than 25 branches at the leading
supermarket, Al Meera. The brand is
targeting the Arab market with it's flavoured and fruit
infusion teas. Last year, Kericho
Gold launched 11 ranges of Attitude teas to tap into the youthful market.
