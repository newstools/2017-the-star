Italians have started documenting their historical ties with Kenya, dating back to more than a century ago. A documentary has been produced by one of Italian’s
famous film maker – Giampaolo Montesanto – revealing how the Italians first settled in the Kenyan highlands
to carry out mission work and farming. The documentary showcases historical activities that strengthened the country's close ties with Kenya’s
founding President Jomo Kenyatta and other freedom fighters during and after the colonial period. The documentary also explains how Italians came to dominate Malindi
after the agreement to do space research at the San Marco Project in Ngomeni
was reached between Kenya and Italy. On Tuesday, the Italian community in Malindi and
representatives from the Italian Cultural Institute converged at Malindi’s Stardust
International discotheque hall to watch the documentary. One those featured in the documentary and was present is Franco Esposito, formerly a manager at San Marco in Ngomeni. Esposito said Italians started coming after the
signing of the agreement to do space research between the two governments. “However they later brought their families and friends,"
he said. Since then he said Italians invested heavily in
tourism resorts in Malindi. During its hey days, Malindi was known as little Italy,
due to the large number of tourists from Italy. It is only recently when the number reduced due to the economic crisis in Italy. Annemaria Petizozzi from the Italian Cultural
Institute said the documentary will be showcased at the Michael Joseph Centre
in Nairobi today and tomorrow. Fredi De Curatolo said Italians who own property in Malindi
are more than 4,000.
