Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu's trip to the country entails more than possibly attending President Uhuru Kenyatta's second swearing-in. The Times of Israel reported that he said: "The purpose of the trip to Kenya is to deepen ties with Africa, including by establishing connections with nations with which we do not have diplomatic relations." The Prime Minister is expected to attend a luncheon alongside leaders including Presidents John Magufuli (Tanzania), Yoweri Museveni (Uganda), Edgar Lungu (Zambia), Paul Kagame (Rwanda). Others are leaders from parts including Togo, Botswana, Namibia and Ethiopia. He is also expected to meet several leaders before leaving Kenya later on Tuesday. Despite allegations of rigging in the Kenyan election Netanyahu congratulated Uhuru in a November 2 letter on his “landslide victory.” He said the visit, along with planned trips to Belgium, France and India, was proof of an unprecedented diplomatic boom for Israel. “There has never before been anything like this, in political, security, economic or social terms. Israel is now in the best situation it has been in since its founding,” he said on Monday. In July 2016, Netanyahu became the first sitting Prime Minister to visit Kenya.  Read: Deal ruthlessly with terrorists, Netanyahu advises, assures Kenya of support Also read:  Reasons behind 1st Visit From Israel PM Uhuru won a second five-year term on October 26 in a repeat presidential election boycotted by NASA leader Raila Odinga, who said it would not be free and fair.
