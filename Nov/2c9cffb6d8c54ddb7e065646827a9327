Five fishermen who were arrested by Ugandan security personnel secured their freedom on Wednesday after paying Sh11,000 each. They are among 17arrested on Sunday and Monday near Remba Island in Suba North, Homa Bay county. They were apprehended for allegedly trespassing during a fishing expedition in Lake Victoria and later taken to Riabana and Kalangala islands in Uganda. Homa Bay BMU chairman Edward Oremo said they were organising means of transporting the fishermen back home. Oremo said six were still in detention at Kalangala and the other six at Riabana. The fishermen called on Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet to assign marine police officers to Lake Victoria. Oremo said this will cushion the fishermen from frustrations they undergo in the hands of Ugandan security personnel. "Ugandan police persistently harass them. I call on Boinnet to assign marine police to protect us." He added the foreign police officers often arrest Kenyan fishermen, even on Kenyan waters, for no reason. Mbita OCPD Wilson Nanga confirmed the release of the five individuals. "The information we have is that some five individuals have been released but I still don’t know their identity," Nanga said.
