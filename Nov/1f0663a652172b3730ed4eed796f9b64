Addressing the press at Iftin Girls, county commissioner James Kianda said Banane, Kulan and Saka secondary schools are more than 50km from collection
centers. Last year Knut officials complained  head teachers and supervisors had to travel long distances to collect their exams. They said this was not only inconvenient but also may have contributed to poor
performance. But Kianda said that all exam materials were delivered one hour
before the official starting time. “By 7.30am all exam materials had been delivered to all the 60
examination centers across the county. This will be the norm. I assure everybody, including the 4,388 candidates, that
the exams will go on as planned. We will do everything humanly possible to ensure no hitches disrupt its smooth running,” Kinada said. He said the county was working closely with regional commissioner
Mohamud Saleh and regional education director Aden Sheikh to
ensure a helicopter is available if exam papers need to be airlifted to remote areas. Kianda said security was strengthened along the Somalia border. Speaking separately, Garissa High School chief principal  Abdi Maulid
said of 171 candidates in his school, only one failed to sit for the exam because had withdrawn. The school is always among the best performing in the region. Maulid praised Education CS Fred
Matiang'i, saying  he had transformed the national examination system. He said this year's test is a marked improvement over last year's.
