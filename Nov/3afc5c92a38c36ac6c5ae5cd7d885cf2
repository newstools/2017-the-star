United States International University (USIU)-A Mashujaa head coach Tom Olal believes his side is ready to accost Nairobi Sikh Simba at City Park today in a men’s Premier League match. Olal believes the long break witnessed during the election period and the Africa Cup of Nations was enough to rectify the mistakes identified in the first leg and improve the players fitness levels. Mashujaa are ranked fifth with 34 points and will go third if they cage Simba who are seventh with 28 points. Ascending two slots in the standings remains Olal’s sole objective this afternoon. “We are aware we will be in the top three if we emerge victors today. During the long break, we have been training and the fitness level in the squad is good. They are all in good shape and injury free. Simba is a good team and they beat us in the first leg. I hope today the boys will give a good account if themselves,” he noted. Simba who won the premiership title in 2012 have played three matches less and a win today will move them a place higher—above Parkroad Badgers—who are sixth with 29 points. Simba will be advantaged by the return of Allan Iningu who was part of the national team for the just concluded Africa Cup of Nations. Iningu played key role in the Kenyan midfield and his vast experience and exposure is expected to aid his side in dominating the midfield and providing defence splitting passes. The match between Strathmore Gladiators and Wazalendo, which was called off in the fourth quarter on Sunday due to heavy rains witnessed at City Park will now be played on November 10.
