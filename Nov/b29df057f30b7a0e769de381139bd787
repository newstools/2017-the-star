An MP who has served in peace missions in war-torn countries says the opposition is leading Kenya down the wrong path. He advised Kenyans to ignore NASA.  Mbeere South MP Colonel (Rtd) Geoffrey Kingangi said he has served in Sierra Leone, DRC Congo and Eritrea while he was an officer of the Kenya Defence Forces under the UN peace keeping missions. He described the situation in those countries as pathetic and appalling. Speaking at an Embu hotel on Saturday, Kingangi said opposition chief Raila Odinga and his newly formed National Resistance Movement have not  exhausted all constitutional and legal means of solving their grievances. Kingangi  doesn’t want Kenya to plunge into similar state like the countries he served in.
