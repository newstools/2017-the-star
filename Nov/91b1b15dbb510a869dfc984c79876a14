Four Homa Bay MCAs have recorded statements with the police following last week's raid at the home of former Karachuonyo MP James Rege.Â  The raid was conducted by youths perceived to be NASA supporters. The MCAs are Ruth Ombura (nominated), Nereah Amondi (nominated), Michael Odira (Kibiri), and Paul Wamunga (North Karachuonyo). Homa Bay director of CID Daniel Wachira on Wednesday said they summoned the legislators to shed light on the Friday incident. "The four MCAs have recorded statement over the issue. We're investigating their connection with the matter," Wachira said. The leaders who recorded statements hail from the Karachuonyo constituency. During the raid, Victor Muga, 25, was shot dead while others sustained bullet injuries. This was after the unruly youths confronted police deployed to protect the home. Rege fell out with NASA leader Raila Odinga and supported President Uhuru Kenyatta during the August 8 general election. He said the attack on his home was politically motivated and blamed it on area politicians. The former MP said he reported the attack to the police and called on them to accord him security over the threats. "It was orchestrated by some area leaders with whom we differed politically. They hired youth to attack me and burn my home." More on this: One shot dead after youths raid ex-Karachuonyo MP James Rege's home
