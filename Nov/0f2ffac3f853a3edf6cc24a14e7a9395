The nominee for Garissa Water executive on Friday promised to end the perennial water shortage, harvest rainwater and build dams across the county. Nominee Issa Dubow also promised to develop a strategic plan for water resources in the arid, drought-stricken region. He described his plans during his vetting for the Water docket on the County Executive Committee. “Although the rains are not as frequent and reliable, we should ensure that massive run-off during heavy rains do not go to waste. I promise to put in place 100-cubic-metre dams based countywide," Dubow said. He was responding to questions from the vetting panel chaired by speaker Ibrahim Abass in the county assembly chambers.  Dubow promised to tackle the water crisis in Garissa town where water is supplied by the Garissa Water and Sewerage Company. “The biggest challenge is management. The current board as constituted has no capacity to steer the organisation to the levels we want. We need a radical change from the management to the lowest cadres,” Dubow said. “We must get the right people for the job. I promise to do this," Dubow said. He has 10 years' experience in humanitarian assistance and development. He has worked for Oxfam, Care International and other NGOs. Dubow holds a master's degree in public policy and administration and a bachelor's degree in political science and communication. The panel also vetted Issa Yarrow (Agriculture and Livestock] and Habiba Abdi (Education). The three were late nominees. Seven other executives were sworn in on Monday by Governor Ali Korane.
