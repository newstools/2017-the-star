Noel Nderitu is a gospel musician whose album shot to number one on iTunes.  He launched his new album, ‘The Bridge’, on Thursday.  The Star caught up with him.   How did your album get to #1 on iTunes? I was actually surprised by that! I had made some noise online about the album’s online release and put it up on all streaming platforms. The next day I opened my iTunes and saw my face on the Top Albums’ list! People are slowly starting to embrace streaming services in Kenya.   How long have you done music at a professional level? I have been a solo act since the release of my first record, ‘My Kind of Music’, in 2013. That was where it all started. I am a Christian and started playing in church before writing my own music later on. I prefer describing my music by genre — it’s heavily influenced by R&B/soul, hip hop and Afro-pop sounds.  My content will always be informed by my faith.   Why gospel music? I believe my faith speaks into all areas of my life, so I’m not your typical gospel artiste. I could speak about love, social justice, internal struggles and Christ without compromising on my beliefs.   What is your new album about?  My new album is titled ‘The Bridge’, and it’s a compilation of songs that literally carried me through seasons of me doubting whether I should pursue music fully. These songs helped express the hope that I cling to and were sort of a ‘bridge’ to where I am now. Hopefully they can carry a listener into a new season as well and be ‘The Bridge’ for them.   What do you think of musicians making their music trendy to attract audiences? I think that a musician’s expression should not be solely dictated by the audience/fans. While we should know who we primarily talk to and target them well, I don’t think a fan’s expectation should be the driving force of the message your art is trying to convey.
