At least 100 families living along Tana River fear there may be an outbreak of water borne diseases as rains continue pounding the region. Idriss Hassan, a village elder who lives in Mororo, pit latrines have been swept away into the river where residents fetch water for domestic use. The weatherman says the rains will continue in most parts of the county until the first week of December. Idriss said there are no signs of the rain stopping soon. Residents have appealed to the Kenya Red Cross Society to set up tents for displaced people who have moved to higher grounds. “Our biggest fear is an outoutbreak of cholera and dysentery, He said. Some of the most affected areas are Mororo, Ziwan and Bakuyu. Transport has been affected in many parts of Tana River where roads are not tamacked.  Buses plying Garissa-Wajir-Mandera and Garissa-Masalani-Holugho toads have reduced the number of trips on these roads. They fear getting stuck in mud and spending days on the roads. “Farmers along the river have also incurred huge loses. Their crops havebeen submerged. Last week, the regional security committee suspended public transport following an attack on a police vehicle escorting a bus  to Mandera. During the incident, two police officers were killed. A senior security official said the move is tactical. Security officers are strategising how to deal with al Shaabab  militants. He said the terrorists are taking advantage of rains to carry out attacks. However, regular transport is resuming slowly.
