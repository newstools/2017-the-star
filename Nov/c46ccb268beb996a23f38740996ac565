Six people were seriously injured after a lorry crashed into a shop in Webuye on Monday evening. Among those severely injured is a disabled cobbler who was repairing shoes outside the shop.  The driver and four customers watching videos inside the shop reportedly suffered broken limbs and were rushed to a nearby hopsital. Betty Akoth, a witness, said the lorry was being driven at a high speed and hit several motorcycles during the accident. "I saw this lorry veering from side to side at a high speed. It is only by God's mercy that when the [other] women saw the lorry, they screamed and alerted people who scampered to safety," she said. Residents have asked authorities to erect road bumps to avert future accidents. Bungoma East police boss Zacheeus Ngeno said they are investigating the cause of the accident. "We have managed to call a bulldozer from Nzoia sugar factory that has helped pull the lorry from the shop," he said. Subcounty administrator Ronald Jumbe said that is the third accident to occur in the area. "We are only lucky that today was not a market day like Wdnesday where a lot of people are usually around," he said. He thanked residents for assisting those injured during the accident and rushing them to hospital.
