Secession talks by Coast political leaders are insincere and selfish, the Mombasa Republican Council has said and asked why it was not supported years ago. On Friday, Governors Hassan Joho (Mombasa) and Amason Kingi (Kilifi), several MPs and senators declared their determination to secede saying the region has been marginalised by successive governments. They made the secession announcement at Joho's office saying it will end marginalisation and see to it that the Coast is led by its people.

The group initiated self rule calls years ago, while it was outlawed, but has since made its agenda known to the government and declared support for President Uhuru Kenyatta. Mraja told journalists the statements by Joho and Kingi might trigger political violence in the region. "When we were agitating for self-rule, they were quite. We were arrested and taken to court but none of them came to our rescue. Why are they coming out to speak about it now?" He said Joho and Kingi, who had declared interested in State House come 2022, are looking for political mileage. Kingi said their dreams of becoming presidents of Kenya will not materialise. "It is impossible for a Kenyan from a small ethnic group to dream of becoming a president in this republic. Therefore, there is need for Coast to secede and be led by its people," he said. The Coast region has six counties - Mombasa, Kilifi, Kwale, Lamu, Tana River and Taita Taveta. Governors Salim Mvurya (Kwale), Fahim Twaha (Lamu), Granton Samboja (Taita Taveta) and Dado Godana (Tana River) did not address the press with their counterparts.
