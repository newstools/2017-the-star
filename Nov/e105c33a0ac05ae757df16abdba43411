Standard Chartered has announced plans to digitize its branches and move at least 80 per cent of their transactions to non-branch platforms, pointing to a massive layoff plan. According to chief executive Lamin Manjang, the bank has set aside Sh154 billion for the global exercise, expected to end by year 2020. On the other hand, the bank’s transaction banking managing director, Kennedy Mubita, noted that the transfer will lead to digitisation of some branches while some will be closed down depending on demand. “If we establish that a certain branch is needed, then we will keep it, however if we find that traffic is not going to that branch then we can look at cheaper ways to serve the clients because running a branch is expensive,” Mubita said. While at this, the bank unveiled an on-premises electronic cash depository machine to provide an end to end cash management system for corporates. “The machine is configured to the client’s bank account held at the bank. Our clients will be provided with unique electronic cards configured to the specific users,” Manjang said.
