Kenya is making a new attempt to end tuberculosis in 15 years. Currently, Kenya features on the three lists of 30 high-burden countries for TB, HIV-associated TB, and multi-drug resistant TB. Health PS Julius Korir said the country is working to improve early diagnoses of TB and prompt treatment to reduce new infections and deaths. Korir joined 75 ministers in Russia last week in signing a declaration to end TB by 2030. “The country has already adopted the latest WHO global recommendations on TB-HIV and is scaling up policies that ensure integrated, patient-centred delivery of effective prevention, early detection, and prompt treatment,” he said. The new target is more ambitious than the current World Health Organisation strategy to eliminate TB fully by 2050 in low-burden countries. This framework outlines an initial “pre-elimination” phase, aiming to have fewer than 10 new TB cases per million people per year by 2035 in these countries. The goal is to then achieve full elimination of TB by 2050, defined as less than one case per million people per year. Kenya’s TB control strategy is complicated by its high HIV burden. The country is one of the 30 nations that account for 89 per cent of all new HIV infections worldwide.
