A family in Kibachenje village, Bungoma county, is mourning the death of a 58-year-old man who drowned on Tuesday night in a river after a drinking spree. Namachanja Mayende is said to have drowned while trying to cross a bridge at River Sio at 9pm. He was with friends from the neighbouring Namsanda village. The five friends he was drinking with discovered he was not with them and they went back to look for him, but he was nowhere to be found. They said he was very drunk. Mayende's body was discovered by a relative on Wednesday morning, who saw his cap floating in the river. Friends, neighbours and relatives thronged the homestead to condole with Mayende's family. A relative yesterday told journalists those who were with Mayende came to her house at night and asked if he had arrived home. "In the morning when we woke up, I asked my husband is he had seen his brother but he said he had not," she said "We decided to look for him since it’s not normal for him to sleep outside his house even when he is drunk." Elder Fred Kasili said they must slaughter a sheep and perform Bukusu traditional rituals to "cleanse his spirit". He said the person who discovered the body is usually given a cow. Elder Chrispinus Wabomba said the wooden bridge from where Mayende in suspected to have slipped was constructed by a well-wisher. He asked Governor Wycliffe Wangamati to construct a better bridge to ensure the safety of those who use it, including schoolchildren.
