The cost of living measure for the month of October eased to 5.72 per cent from 7.06 per cent in September on the back of favourable weather conditions. Data by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics shows that this is the lowest point in more than a year where inflation was last recorded below 6 per cent as at June 2016. In the period between September and October, the food and non-alcoholic drinks index dropped by 1.78 per cent. Cabbages recorded the largest price decline in the food basket, falling 13.21 per cent to Sh38.57 compared to Sh46.58 per kilo in September. The month-on-month price of a kilogramme of carrots also went down 11.13 per cent to Sh60.09 from 67.55 the previous month. “Food and non-alcoholic drinks’ index decreased due to the observed drop in the cost of several food items which was mainly attributed to favourable weather conditions,” KNBS director general Zachary Mwangi said in the monthly inflation statement. During the period under review, the cost of housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels increased by 0.47 per cent. The cost of electricity jumped the highest by 4.06 per cent to Sh603.25 from Sh581.79 per 50kwh in September. “The higher cost of electricity was attributed to increase in the foreign exchange adjustment charges despite the fuel cost and other charges remaining constant,” Mwangi said. The transport index also registered an increase of 0.86 largely driven by increased fuel pump prices of petrol and diesel which rose to Sh102.55 and Sh89.68 per litre respectively. The drop is in line with a forecast made by the Central Bank of Kenya last month, where the government’s fiscal agent said inflation was expected to decline in the following months due to lower food prices with the onset of the short rains and government subsidies on some food items. This is the third time this year that the monthly cost of living measure has fallen within CBK’s target ranging between 2.5 and 7.5 per cent. Last month, inflation was recorded at 7.06 per cent while in January, overall inflation stood at 6.99 per cent.
