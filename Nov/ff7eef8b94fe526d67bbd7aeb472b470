US President Donald Trump's Twitter account briefly vanished on Thursday, but has since been restored, the social media company has said. It said that the @realdonaldtrump account was "inadvertently deactivated due to human error by a Twitter employee". The account was down for 11 minutes, and Twitter is now investigating. Trump - who is an active Twitter user with 41.7 million followers - has not commented on the issue. On Thursday evening, visitors to Trump's page for a short time could only see a message that read "Sorry, that page doesn't exist!" After the account was restored, Trump's first tweet was about the Republican Party's tax cuts plan. @POTUS, the official account of the US president, was unaffected. Trump joined Twitter in March 2009. He has been actively using the social media platform to promote his policies and also attack his political opponents both during the presidential campaign in 2016 and since taking office in January.
