Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu has asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to stop entertaining Raila Odinga's "endless demands". Waititu told Uhuru to take tough legal measures against the NASA leader if he continues threatening national security by calling for mass action and resistance. "We are telling Uhuru that he is not a bishop. He should whip someone who causes problems because we want peace in Kenya," he said. The Opposition chief transformed NASA into a resistance movement and later said he would form a People's Assembly. He said they will use legal channels to demands reforms, not violence.  More on this: 'Liberation struggle on': Raila forms People's Assembly Waititu told Raila: "You have tried and lost. It is God who has refused you. Stop troubling us and threatening to do this or that. There are laws...the President should be firm in its application." The MP accused the Opposition leader of being behind the violence that rocked Kawangware, Nairobi, last week. He noted Raila must respect the constitution as he fought for it. Waititu spoke on Wednesday afternoon at Nyandundo village in Mirangine, Ol Kalou constituency, during the burial of Reverend Samuel Kimemia. The Reverend was Nyandarua Governor Francis Kimemia's younger brother. He died in an accident in Gilgil last week while going to get his son from school.
