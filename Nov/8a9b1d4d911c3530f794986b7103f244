Senator Kipchumba Murkomen and ODM communication director Philip Etale engaged in an ugly twitter altercation on Wednesday. This followed an incident at Wiper office in Lavington on Tuesday where two journalists were assaulted by goons. The media workers were attacked during a meeting by NASA leader Raila Odinga. Citizen TV's Francis Gachuri was roughed up and threatened with a beating while an NTV videographer was slapped.

Gachuri who was threatened tweeted saying Etale had nothing to do with the harassment of journalists during the event. "One more thing, it's not true that @EtalePhilip urged the youths to rough me up. He actually was instrumental in helping me to safety," Gachuri said. But Elgeyo Senator Kipchumba Murkomen went on to tag Etale telling him to ask for forgiveness for his conduct during the scuffle. "I hope @EtalePhilip will ask for forgiveness for his conduct at the scene especially chanting "go to Bomas" to err is human. Let's move on," Murkomen said. Murkomen's remarks were not taken lightly by Etale who hit back at him calling him an idiot. "You idiot, did you hear me speak. Stop being petty and foolish. Stop stooping too low," Etale said. Etale told Murkomen to face him in person rather than on twitter. "If you have a problem with me, face me in person...," he said. But in a quick rejoinder, Murkomen told Etale "Ok Philip. Tea on me." The issue of tea nearly led to fist fights at a Nairobi hotel when Opposition leaders chased away Murkomen over the remarks. Read: Tea bill ‘joke’ turns ugly as NASA, Jubilee MPs faceoff
