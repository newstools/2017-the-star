An elderly circumciser and four women on Thursday appeared in a Narok court charged with involvement in the outlawed female genital mutilation. Mercy Langat, Faith Koech, Joan Towett and Faith Yegon are accused of allowing their premises to be used for the outlawed practice on November 22 at Kutetet village in Narok West. Elena Tereget, the circumciser, was charged with carrying out the operation on the women on the same day and in the same village. They appeared before Narok senior principal magistrate Tito Gesora. The accused pleaded not guilty. The four women who were “cut” were released on a Sh75,000 bond each or a cash bail of Sh50, 000. Their case will be heard on December 4. The court denied Tereget bond  since she was a repeat offender.  FGM is rampant during the long school holiday. The ruling is set for November 29.
