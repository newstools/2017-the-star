Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua has sacked 107 employees and reinstated 204 others who had been suspended for an audit by the county’s finance department. Mutua said the 107 employees will be served with official suspension letters. He said the county will begin the process of asset recovery and sue those found to have misappropriated public funds. “I have received the phase 2 report of the task force vetting and auditing the staff and systems of the finance department. 204 employees have been cleared and they will report back to work on Monday [today] for orientation on the new financial system before they resume office,” Mutua said. He was addressing journalists at his office in Machakos town on Thursday.
