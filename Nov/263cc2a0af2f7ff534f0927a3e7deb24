Some Meru residents want PNU politician Mugambi Imanyara to withdraw his petition challenging the election of Senator Mithika Linturi. They alleged a sinister motive and noted unity was at risk. Karen Ntinyari said Imanyara should follow the bold steps of former Governor Peter Munya. The PNU leader filed an application to withdraw his petition against the election of Governor Kiraitu Murungi.

Last month, Imanyara expressed confidence that he would win the case. "I know there are those who expect me to withdraw the case as well but with Munya and Kiraitu working together, we anticipate the President will give us directions," he said. The politician said he won "bya great margin" in the August 8 general election. "In the eventuality of fresh elections, I am confident I will win," he added. On November 21, the Meru High Court asked returning officer Macharia Gichichi to furnish Imanyara with certified copies of Linturi's academic papers and self-declaration form. Hearings were set for December 11 to15. Also read: Mugambi Imanyara loses bid for votes scrutiny, confidential witness   Click here for the latest political news
