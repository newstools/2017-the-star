Operations at the West Kenya Sugar Company in Kakamega county were disrupted on Monday when boda boda operators protested the death of one of their own. A rider had been run over by a tractor belonging to the company. Two tractors from the company were torched. The boda boda operator, popularly known as Boston Ranger, was run over by the factory’s tractor. He died on the spot. He was hit by the tractor on Sunday at 7.30pm near Ingavira Primary School on the Kambi Mwanza–Ingavira road. The next morning, boda boda operators barricaded the road, while chanting dirges. They pitched camp at the main factory gate for a whole day and lit bonfires. They said they would not leave until the factory management listens to them. No tractor was allowed to drive out or into the factory. It took the intervention of five area MCAs to calm the operators. The five are Mugai Shirugu MCA Leonard Soita, West Kabras’s David Ndakwa, Kevin Mahelo of Butali Chegulo, Lazaro Lucheveleli of East Kabras and Samson Tali of South Kabras. The leaders held a crisis meeting with the management of the company for more than two hours, before they emerged and talked to the boda boda operators and the press. The MCAs faulted the company for using what they termed “unroadworthy” tractors. They said some of the tractors do not have headlights. Efforts to get a comment from the company officials were unsuccessful as they did not pick calls. The MCAs said they will compel the company to foot the funeral expenses and compensate the deceased boda boda operator’s family. The MCAs also, asked the operators not to take the law in their hands.
