S auti Sol is one intensely relatable band. Their perspective never strays away from the times. This year alone, heavy, romance-filled, party tracks recur through their catalogue, and it keeps getting better.  It is impressive to see how Willis Chimano, Delvin Mudigi, Bien-Aimé Baraza and Polycarp Otieno have remastered their craft. They started this journey with simple tracks that somehow placed them in the limelight, and, fast-forward 12 years on, they are among the top names in the African music scene today. They have always been tight, professional and smooth, and they remain truly excellent at their sound. To ensure their presence is felt, they’ve been working with various top artistes across the continent. Last year, they joined Ali Kiba on “Unconditionally Bae” and Yemi Alade on “Africa,” tracks that became outright hits. This year, they’ve worked with KCee, Bebe Cool and C4 Pedro. Still, their latest release “Melanin,” and probably their best-ever production to date, taps Patoranking’s brilliance. The diverse features could be an intentional move to aid infiltrate newer markets, to continue trading off the Kenyan sound or maybe to incorporate elements of big names to their work. And from this venture, it’s pretty clear that the quartet has been working on an LP thick on features from across Africa — one bigger than Live and Die in Afrika. For a bunch of music enthusiasts with a taste for Afro-pop tunes, Sauti Sol have done awfully well for themselves. Now they are bursting back into the bigger scene with hit after hit. The truth is, it’s was never an easy journey for them and, therefore, they deserve every single blessing that comes their way.  With a hefty three albums under their belt, an endless list of collaborative efforts, and a constant string of performances around the world, it seems the quartet is here to stay. There’s great anticipation from their fans of what their next album will look and sound like.  We expect it will be astonishing.
