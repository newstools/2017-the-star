 KCPE exam results will be out sooner than expected, ICT CS Joe Mucheru has said. Mucheru said the examinations papers are already being marked with the use of technology which is expected to make the process faster than before.   Last week, the Kenya National Examinations Council chairman George Magoha said they had acquired 20 machines to be used in marking the exam. Speaking at Karaka High School yesterday, Mucheru said the results will be out one week earlier than usual. "There is plenty of technology deployed in marking the papers. We are looking forward to the results," Mucheru said. He was at Kabarak to oversee the opening of the container for the distribution of KCSE exam materials to various schools in Nakuru county. He assured candidates of an environment conducive to exam-taking. "Parents and teachers have done there part. The government is also doing its part. Everything will be well," Mucheru said.
