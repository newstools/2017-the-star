We can respect NASA leader Raila Odinga’s efforts for electoral reform and a level playing field, but getting sworn in as President is not the way to go. It would be disruptive and against the law. NASA should respect the Constitution and the law. The Constitution nowhere allows anyone to be sworn in as President of Kenya outside the law. Which Supreme Court registrar and, or judge would attend any such ceremonial? Even pretending to be a representative of State House is a crime, let alone President. Any swearing in of Raila outside the Constitution and the relevant laws would not be formal or legal. The President is the Commander-in-Chief of the Kenya Defence Forces and the law and common sense do not contemplate an alternative or rival C-in-C. Raila is surrounded by one of the most formidable brain trusts, incorporating thinkers like David Ndii and Kisumu Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o. Some of them should advise him against escalating the political impasse with such an installation.
