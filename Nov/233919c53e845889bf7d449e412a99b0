More than 2,000 squatters living in Kamiti Anmer Forest in Kiambu constituency have told the Kenya Forest Service to stop harassing them. This comes after the KFS gave them a notice to vacate 419 acres considered forestland. The squatters have urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to intervene and settle them. They also accused the county security team of intimidation. The 419 acres had been a forest, but was degazetted as agricultural land in 1995. President Daniel Moi awarded the land to the squatters, they said. The squatters have since engaged in protracted battles with the forest agency. Through Kamiti Forest Squatters’ Association, Kamiti Anmer Development Association and Muungano wa Kamiti Squatters, they want the parcels divided for them  County Ecosystem conservator George Njenga said the squatters were given until December to leave.
