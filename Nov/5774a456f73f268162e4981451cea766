Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has accused hotel owners of illegally disposing garbage in the central business district. He has authorised the Inspectorate department to arrest the owners and anyone found dumping.  The directive came as Sonko marked 100 days in office early this week. “Let them know that my team is on the lookout. So let no one be found dumping garbage illegally within the city. Its our responsibility as Nairobians to keep it clean,” he said. “They pay street kids to pick up garbage from the back doors of the hotels at night and dump it along the lanes in the city.” Sonko also posted his contacts on his Twitter handle and Facebook account so the public can notify him about anyone seen dumping. A resident has asked, however, what Sonko plans to do with people who urinate in the open. “What will you do about the dumping and urinating just outside Choppies supermarket on Mfangano Street? Upcountry matatu touts and customers,” Eddie Muge asked.  Another was skeptical. George Mulinge said, “I know they (Inspectorate officers) will be on the ground for less than two weeks. Afterwards the bad behaviour resumes, so we better come up with an all day every time solution, Sir.” Another said, “Nairobi is the complete contrast of #Kigali why can’t we Kenyans borrow a leaf? That city is extremely clean and the people are orderly, very sensitive to their environment.”  Cilas Odungo said, “South B is notorious for this [garbage], Bwana Governor. You may want to deploy your team there as well.”  In August Sonko launched Operation Ng’arisha Jiji to restore Nairobi to the “Green City in the Sun”. He has made several attempts to clean up the city, but none has been sustained.
