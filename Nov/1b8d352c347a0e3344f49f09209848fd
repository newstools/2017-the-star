A 21-year-old disabled man, who literally voted with his feet, hopes his life can change for the better after State House pledged to help him. Photos of Gichuhi Macharia voting with his feet in Thika circulated on social media. He was born without arms. He attracted the attention of President Uhuru Kenyatta on Election Day. Uhuru sent Transport CS James Macharia and local administration officers to find him. Macharia was found at his rented single-room in Witeithie estate, Thika, Kiambu county. Macharia promised to get him a new residence and source of livelihood. Gichuhi was astonished by the visit and expressed hope he will get help to set up a business. He has a Diploma in Computer Studies and uses his feet to write, eat, type and drive. He lives with a helper. “People promised to assist me during campaigns but they never keep their promise and after months of trying to follow up, I gave up,” he added. Gichuhi, who survives on donations from well-wishers and the Rescue Mission Centre, yesterday said his dream to own a cosmetics business may become a reality. “What I want is a business that can accommodate cosmetics, a salon, barbershop and cybercafé. All I need is capital,” he said.
