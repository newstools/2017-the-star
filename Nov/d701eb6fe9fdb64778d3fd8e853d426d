Pwani University has become the first institution to institutionalise Farmer Field Schools in its programmes across Africa. The initiative by the World Food Organization makes Kilifi and Kenya the first county and country in Africa to embrace the initiative. On Wednesday, FAO said Kenya is the first in Africa, among 90 countries, to back the programme expected to train university students in agriculture field extension services. The training was sponsored by FAO and the Swiss Development cooperation for Sh6 million.
