A splinter group of 115 Njuri Nceke elders allied to secretary general Josphat Murangiri and chairman Linus Kathera decamped on Thursday. They shifted to the faction led by secretary general Phares Rutere and chairman Paul M’ithinkia. The Murangiri camp is said to have endorsed NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga. Francis Rimberia, one of the elders who backed Raila, said he regrets that support. Mwenda M’kaunga said the Rutere camp does not discriminate between the rich and the poor. Rutere said they had betrayed the Meru by endorsing Raila for President. He said the leadership of splinter group is questionable. “A Njuri Nceke should not be greedy. We know the other group has been involved in cases and is not fit to hold any public office,” Rutere said. He welcomed the elders who decamped. “We are going to receive more until Murangiri and Kathera remain alone,” Rutere said. The elders spoke at Gankere, North Imenti where a bull was slaughtered to celebrate President Uhuru Kenyatta’s victory.
