A Kiambu MCA has accused NASA leader Raila Odinga of misleading his supporters by withdrawing from the repeat presidential election. Ndeiya MCA Gideon Gachara (in blue coat) said Raila ended up in denying his supporters a chance to exercise their democratic right. He said the poll was within the law and protected by the Constitution. Gachara said the manner in which the opposition leader withdrew from the race was unconstitutional because he failed to sign Form 24A to officially withdraw. “How can you go the court, file a petition against an election, then the Supreme Court rules in your favour and orders for a fresh election. And then you withdraw without following procedures?” the MCA asked. He spoke in Limuru town on Monday, when he led residents to celebrate President Uhuru Kenyatta’s reelection. Gachara urged Raila to accept defeat and preparing to contest again in 2022.
