Starring: Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill, Gal Gadot, Amy Adams, Ezra Miller, Jason Momoa, Ray Fisher Based on: Justice League by Gardner Fox Directed by:  Zack Snyder  Premier date:  November 17   Following the death of Superman in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Batman senses the world is in grave danger. And as the world mourns the fallen hero, supervillain Steppenwolf and his army of Parademons are on the hunt for the three Motherboxes which, when combined, have enough power to destroy Earth. Steppenwolf manages to get the first motherbox from the Amazonians. Diana Prince aka Wonder Woman decides to join Bruce Wayne, aka Batman, in the quest to stop Steppenwolf. But the two of them do not have the necessary power to carry out such a quest on their own. They decide to build a league comprising other metahumans. Batman recruits young and socially awkward Barry Allen, aka the Flash, and (with great difficulty) manages to convince Arthur Curry, aka Aquaman, to join them. Wonder Woman recruits a Victor Stone, aka Cyborg. Batman realises that they will need the help of Superman after all, and decided to bring him back to life using power from the Motherbox. As expected, Superman doesn’t come back the same but manages to remember some things after being reunited with Lois Lane. The film is merely passable. Although the actors, the chemistry and the action sequences work in elevating the film, there is something lacking in the plot. The continuous intertwining of storylines from different franchises and characters ends up confusing the viewers if you don’t follow them all religiously. With an estimated budget of Sh30 billion,Justice League just about manages to break even at the Box Office.   Star Rating: 3/5
