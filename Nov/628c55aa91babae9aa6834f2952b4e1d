The election petition filed by former Cabinet minister Ochillo Ayacko to challenge Migori Governor Okoth Obado started a full hearing on Monday. Five petitioner witnesses who took the stand testified that Obado and his handlers bribed voters ahead of August 8 General Election. Among them were Lucas Opere, a boda boda rider from Awendo, Tom Omollo, a driver at the Sony Sugar Company, and Oliver Jabuya. Opere said at a meeting in March with other boda boda riders at Sony Sugar Stadium, the governor gave them Sh1,000 and asked them to vote for him for his second term. “A ward administrator told us the governor gave us the money,” Opere said. Omollo said he received Sh300 from the governor’s handlers in April to persuade him to vote for him. “The goodies came through his agent, which I gave to a vegetable seller,” Omollo said. When lawyers Rodgers Sagana and Eve Khaika, who represented Obado and the IEBC, respectively, took the witnesses to task on committing an election offence, they said the first suspect to be charged should be Obado. The case was before Migori High Court judge Hillary Chemitei.  The petitioner’s lawyers led by Odhiambo Roche said they have more than 10 witnesses to testify in the case, which continues today.
