Former JP Kwale senator aspirant Mshenga Ruga has asked area leaders to stop politicking along party lines and instead unite to serve residents. Ruga who lost to Issa Boy at the August 8 election said he will work
with Msambweni MP Suleiman Dori from ODM and any other leader, despite the political party they are allied to. Ruga has been seen with Dori when he issued Uwezo Fund cheques to special groups in Msambweni on Saturday. "Some of you here did not vote for ODM. Why are you not
refusing the cheques they are giving you. Then why is it a big deal when I'm
seen working with an ODM MP?" he asked. Ruga said people have been gossiping about him working closely with the Msambweni MP. The politician said a party is just a ticket for one to use as a vehicle to run for a particular seat.  He said leaders made promises to work for the people and it is time to deliver. "If Dori's agenda is to develop Msambweni, then I have to support him to achieve that goal," Ruga said. He said he can defend himself if asked by the President why he is working with Dori.
