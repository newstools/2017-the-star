More than 500,000 passengers have used the Madaraka Express since the train service was launched in June, Kenya Railways Corporation CEO Athanas Maina has said.  In an exclusive interview with the the Star in Voi yesterday, Maina said the introduction of inter-county trains on November 1 increased the number of passengers who have used the train from 337,000 to over 500,000. He estimated that about 4,500 passengers use the train per day.  “Many passengers prefer to use the train because it is cheaper and faster than road transport,” Maina said. Buses take up to seven hours between Mombasa and Nairobi while the train covers the 472-kilometre journey in just five hours. Maina said a cargo train will be launched in January.  At least 5,000 cargo containers have been transported on the standard gauge railway since it was launched.
