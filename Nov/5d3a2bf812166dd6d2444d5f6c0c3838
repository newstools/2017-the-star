The second phase of the Last Mile Connectivity Project by Kenya Power will be jointly funded by the World Bank and the African Development Bank at a cost of $300 million (Sh31.08 billion). This phase two is expected to take at least 18 months and is set to grow Kenya Power’s customer base by 1.5 million new households. As at June 2017, connectivity was recorded at 6.18 million households equivalent to 70 per cent of the country’s connectivity access rate. “We will continue to grow our customer base and venture into new frontiers. The connectivity drive is aimed at increasing revenue to sustain our business and promote socio-economic development,” Kenya Power chief executive Ken Tarus said. The project will require over 10,000 km of cable, more than 65,000km of conductor, 1,000 new distribution transformers, 391,000 wooden poles and 233,000 concrete poles. Speaking during the contract signing with both financiers and contractors, Tarus urged the contractors to maximise on use of local resources, including materials and labour. “We want to encourage the contractors, both local and foreign, to utilise readily available materials in the country,” Tarus said. “I want to see as much of this Sh30 billion remain within the borders of this country.” The electricity distributor yesterday signed a total of 23 contracts for the rural and informal settlement electrification initiative, which is a Vision 2030 flagship project. At least 80 per cent of tenders awarded for the project have been awarded to Kenyan firms, a move aimed at promoting the Buy Kenya Build Kenya initiative. Phase two comes after the implementation of phase one, where 314,200 households are being connected at a cost of Sh13.5 billion, funded by AfDB, which contributed 90 per cent of the amount with the government providing the balance of 10 per cent. Tarus said that Kenya Power’s target is to attain universal access by 2020.
