EACC has recommended the
suspension of MMUST Vice Chancellor Fredrick Otieno
over alleged abuse of office, embezzlement of funds and employment
irregularities. CEO Halakhe Waqo said the suspension was premised on the professor's intimidation of staff involved in the probe through transfers, demotions,
interdictions and dismissals. The recommendations are contained in a letter dated November 10 to the university's council chairman Dr Jeremy Bundi.  Waqo said the VC's actions against the staff amount to interference of investigations in violation of the Ethics and
Anti-Corruption Commission Act and Leadership and Integrity Act. "Further, he has threatened to victimise whoever gives
information as he continues to engage in corrupt practices, abuse of office and
unethical behaviour in trying to cover up for the past vices and prevent our
investigators from obtaining documents from the institution directly or indirectly," Waqo said. According to the Leadership and Integrity Act, any person
who lodges a complaint to a public entity should not be subjected to
harassment, suspension, transfer, verbal or other abuse or unfair treatment. "The commission therefore recommends the suspension of Otieno with immediate effect to enable the commission to conclude its investigation,"
Waqo said. Should the university council heed the commission’s recommendations, the VC will be entitled to half pay for the period he will be on
suspension. This will be until the conclusion of investigations and determination of the
allegations against him. Also read: Masinde Muliro lecturers join dons’ strike
