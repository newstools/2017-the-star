The Kisumu county assembly is today expected to pass a motion for the formation of a People’s Assembly. Already, the Siaya, Homa Bay and Vihiga county assemblies have passed the bill. The motion is spearheaded by NASA to push for electoral justice and initiate a review of the Constitution to safeguard devolution. Majority leader Kenneth Odhiambo said the debate on the motion will be the first order of business. He said the MCAs have been told what the People’s Assembly is all about and have copies of the motion. Migori county assembly is also expected to pass the motion today. The People’s Assembly would comprise governors, deputy governors, senators, MPs, MCAs, religious, trade union and civil society leaders; and representatives of youth and women’s organisations.
