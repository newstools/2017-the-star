The High Court on Thursday gave the go-ahead to privatise five sugar companies in Western Kenya. This follows a decision by Justice Edward Muriithi, who ruled the application to stop the privatisation was premature. “Accordingly, as the mechanisms for alternative dispute resolution between the national and county governments as ordained by the Constitution have not been exhausted, I find that the proceedings before the court are premature,” the court ruled. The ruling, which was read on behalf of Muriithi by Justice Chacha Mwita, also said the court cannot be asked to resolve the dispute, adding it would be usurping the prior jurisdiction of the organs of the Intergovernmental Relations Act, through which the governments shall make every reasonable effort to settle the dispute. He added that, accordingly, the court should strike out the petitions and the judicial review proceedings be consolidated before it.  “In view of the public nature of proceedings, the court does not make any orders as to costs,” reads the judgment. The judge said the alternative dispute resolution efforts ended at a second meeting at which it was agreed that the matter should be referred to the Intergovernmental Relations Committee.  Following the second meeting which took place on February 5, 2016, the petitioners moved to court in May 2016 before any further attempts at amicable settlement in accordance with Article 189 of the Constitution and the Intergovernmental Relations Act. “The eventuality contemplated by Section 35 of the Intergovernmental Relations Act 2012 has not crystallized because all efforts of resolving the dispute have not been exhausted and failed,” read Mwita. Petitioners were advised to exhaust all alternative dispute resolutions methods before resorting to judicial proceedings.
