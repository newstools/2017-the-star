Residents danced and celebrated in Eldoret and throughout the North Rift yesterday after the Supreme Court upheld the reelection of President Uhuru Kenyatta. Celebrations also took place in Iten, Kapsabet and other parts of the Rift Valley. Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago and several MPs led Jubilee supporters in dancing in the streets. Business came to a standstill for hours. Mandago and the leaders called for unity and peace in the country. They had joined residents in following the Supreme Court proceedings on a large-screen TV along Uganda road near the Paradise Hotel. DP William Ruto’s home is in Eldoret and the region is a Jubilee stronghold. “At last, justice has been done. We now await the swearing-in of President Kenyatta and Ruto so we can move forward as a country,” Mandago said. He was joined by MPs Oscar Sudi and Caleb Kostany and Deputy Governor Daniel Chemno. “We urge NASA to accept the verdict just as we accepted the earlier ruling, which nullified our victory,” Sudi said.
