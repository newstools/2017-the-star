Cases of stunted growth caused by poor eating habits are on the rise in Nyandarua county. Dorcas Kamau, incharge of agricultural extension services in Karau ward, on Wednesday said many residents eat too much starch and neglect body building foods. She spoke in Rurii ward, Ol Kalou, during a farmers’ field day to mark the World Food Day. Kamau said the department of agriculture has intervened by encouraging food production in homesteads. Residents are encouraged to maintain kitchen gardens and keep rabbits, chickens, sheep and goats. “We are trying to reach farmers through farming groups. We are encouraging and teaching them the importance of kitchen gardens and small livestock to ensure households are food secure,” Kamau said.  Agriculture chief officer William Cheruiyot said residents need to improve their eating habits.
