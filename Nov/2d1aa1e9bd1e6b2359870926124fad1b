KCSE started late in four schools in Mwingi Central after the vehicle transporting the exams was swept away in River Karura. The area is currently experiencing heavy rainfall.  The driver of the vehicle, which carried mathematics and biology papers, lost control as he attempted to cross the swollen river. The occupants were saved by residents of Kiomo-Kyethani ward who responded to their distress call.  No one was injured in the Monday morning accident but papers for Karurura, Kiomo, Kairungu, Wikithuki secondary schools were destroyed. Area MCA James Muthui said last year's exams were transported by helicopter. He asked the government to construct a bridge at the section to avert future accidents.  "The government must address this issue immediately because residents are suffering. This should not happen again."
