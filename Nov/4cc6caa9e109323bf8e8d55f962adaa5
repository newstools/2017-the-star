Traders in the CBD are relieved following the decision by the Supreme Court decision to uphold President Uhuru Kenyatta’s reelection. Before the verdict was read on Monday, there was tension in most areas, with some fearing chaos might erupt. “ We are happyhe Supreme Court ruling is out and now we can focus on getting our economy back on track,” tout Jimmy Kiboi said. The traders called upon all leaders regardless of the political party to focus on uniting all Kenyans and be at the service of the people who elected them. “I had closed my shop when the ruling was made because of fear that chaos would erupt but I’m happy that even those who were in merrymaking moods did their celebrations and our businesses were not affected,” Sheila Nangena, a trader along Tom Mboya Street said. On Friday NRM supporters looted business along Jogoo Road during a confrontation with the police.
