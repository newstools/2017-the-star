The Kakamega government has teamed up with Unicef to carry out mobile vaccination of children in the county as the nurses’ strike continues to wreak havoc. Vaccines, including Pentavalent, Polio and the measles vaccine, expired a month ago, raising fears of a possible resurgence of diseases that had been contained. This was after parents stopped taking their children to hospitals for vaccination following the nurses’ strike, which began on June 5. Pentavalent protects children from whooping cough, tetanus and diphtheria. Other vaccines include one for polio and another for measles. Yesterday, county Health executive Peninah Mukabane said viable vaccines are being administered by nurses employed on contract by the county and those hired by Aphia-Plus, an NGO. “The nurses are moving around the county in the Beyond Zero van donated by First Lady Margaret Kenyatta to vaccinate children who are due for the jabs. We are also sensitising communities to bring their children to central points where vaccines can be administered,” she told the Star on the phone. The government stopped paying the salaries of the 1,300 nurses participating in the strike in August. Vaccines are not procured by Unicef because of their high cost. A spot check by the Star in public health facilities in the county indicated the shelf life of tens of thousands of anti-malaria drugs expires this month. Kakamega is a malaria-endemic zone.
