NASA leader Raila Odinga on Saturday added his voice to the condemnation of the killing of 300 cows belonging to Maasai herders in Laikipia county. Raila said the killing is the “most open display of impunity and utter disregard for the livelihoods and survival of marginalised communities”. He said a similar occurrence only happened in the 1990s when ranchers confiscated at least 5,000 heads of cattle in Laikipia. More than 5,000 huts and grain stores were burnt to push out the Maasai. “Strangely, the ranchers knew what the cattle meant to the Maasai. They confiscated the cattle rather than kill them. Kenya Police on the other hand killed the cattle in a show of utter contempt of the community’s way of life,” Raila said. On Wednesday last week, police at a ranch in Laikipia opened fire on livestock they found grazing on a private farm. They claimed the herders were using the animals as shields while firing at them. Raila told the government to compensate owners of the killed cows. His call was supported by Kajiado East MP PerisTobiko and politicians Daniel Tenaai and Tarayia ole Kores. “The pointless and horrific killing of cows on our ancestral land by triggerhappy police officers is not only a crime against the Maa community, but is also an attack on our livelihood,” Tobiko told the Star yesterday.
