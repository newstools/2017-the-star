This year’s edition of the Standard Chartered Nairobi Marathon has received pledges of over Sh40 million sponsorship from 11 corporates ahead of the race set for November 26. The partners and co-sponsors are—Nairobi County Government (Sh5m), IS Solutions ( Sh2.5m), Alpine Coolers (Sh6.3m), Sanlam Insurance (Sh2.9m), Safaricom (Sh 2.5m), AUA Industria (6.1m), Avenue Health (Sh5.6m), Parapet (Sh945,000), Subaru Kenya (Sh500,000), Kenafric Diaries (Sh4.6m), KICC (Sh700,000) and Nakumatt (Sh600,000) This year has also seen Standard Chartered Bank extended its partnership with Athletics Kenya to sponsor the Nairobi Marathon until 2022. “These contributions make it possible for us to continuously improve the marathon year after year. Being the largest sporting event in Kenya, the Nairobi Marathon plays an important role in profiling our nation,” said the Local Organizing Committee (LOC) chairman Peter Gitau. Gitau said the registration process was going on smoothly and expressed optimism that the organisers will realise the projected 25,000 runners. All registrations are being done online. All participants, individual and corporates, can register through the official marathon website www.sc.com/ke/Nairobimarathon at a fee of Sh2,000 till November 17. There will, however, be a window to accommodate marathon enthusiasts who would have missed our deadline at a cost of Sh2,500 between November 18- 24. The event earlier scheduled for October 26 was shelved to this month due to repeat presidential race.
