European envoys have objected the secession call by two NASA county chiefs at the Coast saying it will cause more tension. They casâ€‹tâ€‹ aspersions on Monday, noting the drive for self-rule could plunge the region into chaos. Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho and Kilifi's Amason Kingi are two of four governors pushing for self-determination. They have cited political and economic marginalisationâ€‹ in the call supported by a host of Opposition MPs from the region.

British High Commissioner Nic Hailey, French ambassador Antoine Sivan, European Union envoy Stefano Dejak and Danish ambassador Mette Knudsen attended. Though other agendas were tabled, The Star was reliably informed that secession talks took centre stage.

The rhetoric may raise tension tather than calm it down." Hailey added disintegration will not help and that the country need urgent national dialogue to address dissenting voices. "The country must have genuine conversations that will lead to improved development and prosperity," he said. Dejak noted the call for secession was triggered by "strong feelings of exclusion". "Now we have to strengthen inclusion and devolution. Logic inclusion can work best," he said, adding the 2010 constitution, which 67 per cent Kenyans approved, must be adhered to. But the two governors were unmoved. "We have our own position which we are determined to pursue," Kingi said. Joho said secession talks will rage and invited all, including the envoys, to air their views again. "You can oppose it but tell us why your are opposing it. We are more concerned about local and international legal frameworks to achieve the end," he said. The ODM deputy leader added that concerns that chaos will erupt and that 'foreigners' will be chased away do not hold water.
