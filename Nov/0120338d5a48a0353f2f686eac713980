There was song and dance as Nyandarua residents celebrated the swearing-in of President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto on Tuesday. Most people followed the event from television screens in hotels, cafes and drinking joints while others remained glued to screens mounted in various markets. They expressed hope that Uhuru will quickly unite the country and fix the ailing economy. Mau Mau war veterans Bernard Njoroge and Mwangi Muhihu said Uhuru is the best president to have lead Kenya since independence. "I am very happy that he has succeeded. He is a man who interacts well with everyone. Kenya will go far with another president like him," Njoroge said. Traders and their customers celebrated in the Ol Kalou open air market as Uhuru and Ruto took oath of office. "They should never forget it is God who gave them that victory," hawker Peter Muiruri said.
