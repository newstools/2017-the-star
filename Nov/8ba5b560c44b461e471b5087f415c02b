The Kenya Golf Union are keen to establish public golf courses in country in order to attract the public and develop junior talent. KGU chairman, Richard Wanjala encouraged county governments to allocate resources including land for development of public golf courses. “The KGU will use their networks to help governors to design golf courses at affordable rate. We will also advise them on how to build membership and create trusts that can take the ownership of the land that will be set aside,” he said. Speaking at Kitale Golf Club, Wanjala, who is also a director of Kenya Open Golf Limited, said the establishment of public golf courses will go a long way in developing talent and ensuring public participation. “For a long time, golf has been known to be the sport for the elite but we want to change that notion and involve the public,” he pointed out. He said the membership fee being asked by clubs around the country has also discouraged and denied majority of Kenyans a chance to join the golf fraternity. “ This has created a worrying trend for the future of golf,” he added. Wanjala said the country has 42 golf clubs which constitute the membership of the KGU. He noted that most existing golf clubs were set up during pre-independence period by white settlers as a way of entertainment, at a time when Kenyans were merely serving as caddies, hence the problem has been transferred to the current generation. “Today, majority of golfers are affluent,” he added. He said during the Kenya Open tournament early this year, President Uhuru Kenyatta directed the Ministry of Sports to support the KGU by establishing a golf academy at the Lenana School for the training of junior golfers. He said the government has also revealed plans to build an 18 -ole course at the Kasarani Stadium, which is expected to take golf to the next level.
