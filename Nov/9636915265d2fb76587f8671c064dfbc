Maralal residents have welcomed yesterday’s Supreme Court decision that upheld the election of President Uhuru Kenyatta. Supporters of both Jubilee and NASA said the they welcomed the ruling because it will end political campaigns. “I am not happy with the ruling but I welcome it because I am tired of politics,” residents Josephat Lekadeli said.  Maurice Lekurum said he had been disappointed by the electioneering period, saying politicians took the country to the brink of chaos. “I will not vote in the next elections,” Lekerum said. They called on Kenyans to accept the court decision and move on. “Whether you are a Jubilee or NASA supporter, let’s come together and build our country,” another resident John Mbai said. They called on Uhuru to reshuffle his Cabinet and make inclusive appointments for the sake of unity and peace.
