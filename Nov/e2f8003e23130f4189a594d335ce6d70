Embu coffee farmers have threatened to lynch anybody stealing their produce. They made the declaration following theft of coffee worth  Sh2 million. The farmers threatened to take the law into their hands and burn any motor vehicle carrying coffee suspected to have been stolen. The farmers attended a meeting chaired by Embu county cooperative commissioner David Muriuki. He cautioned them to take legal action. Embu Coffee Union chairman Muriuki Maruku and Embu County Enforcement officer Gordon Njagih were present. The farmers said they will form vigilante groups to patrol coffee-growing areas against further theft. The county government offered motor vehicles and enforcement officers to help in the patrols of coffee areas between now and February. Farmers said since the theft four months ago, police have never arrested a single suspect. They say investigations are ongoing. “This theft has become too much and we can’t allow it to continue. We shall not allow some people to play about with Embu coffee farming such that after toiling in our farms they come and steal,” Maruku said. Farmers atthe meeting in Emco Hall, Embu, said they will resort to taking the law into their hands and deal with the culprits themselves. During the meeting, it was agreed that there will be a curfew against motor vehicles in the coffee areas from 10pm. Any motorist found will be searched by farmers and if found carrying any amount of coffee , they will be arrested and taken to police.
