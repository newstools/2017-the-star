The government has refused to increase maize prices to Sh4,000 per 90kg bag. Agriculture CS Willy Bett said the Sh3,200 offered by the NCPB is the best price compared to what is in the market.  On Wednesday, he said the government will help farmers dry their maize following the rains. Bett spoke during the World Food Day celebrations at Mama Sarah Boit Farm in Sugoi. The state will spend Sh6 billion buying maize this year. Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago urged the government to increase the price to at least Sh3,500 per bag. He said farmers have made huge losses because of unfavourable weather and the fall armyworm invasion. “We appreciate the price given, but it should be enhanced to give farmers  enough profit to go back to their farms next season,” Mandago said.
