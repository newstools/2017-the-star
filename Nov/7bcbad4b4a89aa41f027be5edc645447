The Supreme Court will deliver its judgment on the October
26 Presidential election petitions on Monday. Whatever the outcome, it is a good thing that Kenyans are
using the courts to resolve their differences. However, events leading up to the rerun and the subsequent
petitions suggest that this country is deeply divided. Increasingly, there have
been calls from various quarters for national dialogue to ensure our political
problems are resolved. The arrival of Raila Odinga from the US and Europe on Friday
showed that he has intently loyal supporters who are determined to stick with
him. Therefore it is incumbent upon political leaders on both sides of the
divide to come to their senses and realize that continued political unrest and
instability are harmful to the country and the economy. There is likely to be no clear winner or loser from the
Supreme Court justicesâ€™ majority ruling on Monday. It is imperative that leaders on both sides of the political
divide put Kenya first and ensure that the 45 million Kenyans emerge the
winners.
