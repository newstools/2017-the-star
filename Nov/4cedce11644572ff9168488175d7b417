Book: Binti Author:  Nnedi okorafor Genre: Speculative Young Adult Fiction   This novel is all about afrofuturism — science fiction that focuses on African history and culture.  Lead character Binti is an intelligent mathematical prodigy from the Himba tribe. She is venturing out for the first time after being accepted to join the prestigious Oozma University, an institution set in space.  Her bravery is depicted by the fact that despite the risk of becoming a pariah in her own home, which doesn’t allow for one to stray from cultural norms, she sneaks off to set on this adventure.  On the ship, she integrates with and makes friends with people who don’t understand her cultural background, which is very conspicuous, from her clothes and threaded hair covered in red clay.  On the way to Oozma, their spaceship is attacked by human-sized jellyfish people called Meduse, whose “domes’ [are] flesh-thin as fine silk, their long tentacles spilling down to the floor like a series of gigantic ghostly noodles”.  Binti survives the first attack because the Meduse can’t touch her due to a mysterious ancient artefact she’s carrying called the edan. Dr Nnedi Okorafor is a Nigerian-American writer who spoke at the TED Global Conference in Arusha just this August.  Game of Thrones co-creator RR Martin is currently adapting her novel, Who Fears Death, for HBO.  This novella, which won the 2016 Nebula Award and Hugo Award for best novella, is only 96 pages long, and to discuss it in depth would be to give spoilers.  It would certainly make for the perfect short read for any fans of afrofuturism and science fiction.    Star Rating: 4/5
