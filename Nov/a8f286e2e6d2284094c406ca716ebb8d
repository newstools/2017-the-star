University lecturers yesterday presented a petition to Parliament seeking to compel the Ministry of Education to honour their CBA. The University and Academic Staff Union argues failure to honour the deal, which was signed and registered in court, amounts to breach of contract. The operation period for the 2013-2017 contract expired in June. It was supposed to give way to a new 2017-2021 CBA. Led by secretary general Constantine Wasonga and former secretary general Muga K’olale, the lecturers demanded that MPs urgently take up the matter so operations can return to normal. The union wants Sh5.2 billion set aside to pay arrears as well as salaries in subsequent months. The petition further wants the MPs to intervene and facilitate the implementation of pension payments between 2010 and 2017. According to ODM nominated MP and Knut secretary general Wilson Sossion, the government has used the Salaries and Remuneration Commission as a scapegoat to avoid honouring the salary deal. “We want to urge lecturers not to call off the strike until the matter is properly squared out because what works in this country is pressure, and the petition has been given to us and we will give it due treatment,” he said. UASU secretary general Constantine Wasonga said most universities have a poor pay structure with most lecturers’ salaries delayed. He decried the poor funding of research, teaching and innovation. “Unless the situation is addressed, there is an impending collapse of the higher education sector in Kenya,” Wasonga said.  Should the strike persist, varsities are set for another adjustment to their academic calendars. It will be the second time this academic year that the varsities will be extending their calendars after another strike that ended in July. Wasonga said end-of-semester examinations, continuous assessment tests and graduation ceremonies will be most affected. The Multimedia University of Kenya was supposed to hold its graduation tomorrow.
