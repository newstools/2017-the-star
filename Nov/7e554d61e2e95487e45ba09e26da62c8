Civil society and religious leaders in Mt Elgon, Bungoma county, yesterday condemned increasing murders and rapes by thugs. They want police officers and their bosses, whom they say have overstayed in the region, to be transferred immediately for allegedly colluding with criminals. Eight people have been killed by thugs in two weeks and no one has been arrested, they told a press conference in Kimilili town.  The groups included Civil Society Elgon Sisters CBO chairperson Emily Chepkuto and Kaptama Pastors Network chairman Pastor John Matui.  Bungoma county commissioner Joshua Chepchieng said he is working with police IG Joseph Boinnet to deploy police reservists. He urged residents to surrender unlicensed guns.
