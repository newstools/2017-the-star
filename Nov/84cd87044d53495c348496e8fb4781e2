Juvenile detention facilities countrywide will receive beds, mattresses and blankets in a government progamme. The programme begins with Kakamega-based Shikusa Borstal Institution, then to Shimo La Tewa in Mombasa and Kamiti-Kamae borstals.  Correctional Services PS Richard Ekai made the announcement on Wednesday, when he visited Kakamega Main Prison. He also visited Shikusa Borstal. Ekai met the 429 juvenile inmates in Shikusa Borstal and presented the first batch of 192 beds, 384 mattresses, 384 blankets, 384 sweaters and 1,152 metres of fabric for making uniforms.   He said the government is concerned about the poor conditions in the facilities.  Ekai said, “We want you to become good people so you are accepted back to society when you leave this place. The government wants to serve you well.”
