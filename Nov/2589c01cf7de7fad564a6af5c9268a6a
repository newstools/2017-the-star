A Safaricom director wants the court to stop her arrest and prosecution in relation to a fatal accident she caused. Sylvia Mulinge, director of the Consumer Business Unit, is expected at Kibera law courts next Monday to plead to traffic related charges. The DPP ordered her prosecution on October 19 for dangerous driving after the death of an eight-year-old girl. A lobby group moved to court on July 19 suing her and Safaricom for the accident. The International Centre for Policy and Conflict also wants police to take action against Mulinge. But Mulinge said the officer who filed a report exonerated her. Mulinge was involved in an accident on February 1, 2015 at the Southern bypass as she droveÂ Lang'ata road from Ngong road. "The road signs indicate vehicles are not allowed to stop at that section," she argued through Njoroge Regeru and Co. Advocates. "The applicant proceeded to Lang'ata police station on the same day and made a report of the accident. On the following day, she recorded a statement ...to enable police carry out investigations." Mulinge argues that when her vehicle was released, police confirmed she was not responsible for the minor's death. She said ICPC does not disclose any wrongdoing or breach of the constitution or any written law on her and Safaricom's part. "The decision by the DPP and the IG of Police to re-open the case after over two years ... is made in bad faith and the charges were mostly pushed by external forces," she argues. "It follows that without any new evidence, the charges filed are malicious and an abuse of court process."
