The Kisumu county government has banned demonstrations in the city, unless they are called by NASA or ODM. Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o yesterday said if anybody has concerns on whether to conduct demonstrations in the county, they should address them accordingly with the party officials or the county government. He said Kisumu has been a target for criminals, “who take advantage of the street protests to destroy and loot property”. On Monday, demos rocked the city in the Kondele area after the Supreme Court verdict that upheld President Uhuru Kenyatta’s repeat election victory. A vehicle was burnt, property destroyed and a Safaricom booster vandalised. Nyong’o said such people go against the party position and will not be allowed. They go against NASA leader Raila Odinga’s directions, he added. “The party leadership was very clear that we are not participating in the repeat election. So, whatever the Supreme Court decided did not concern us,” the county chief said.  “When we met in Nairobi, we decided that our demos would only be done in Nairobi. “Anybody demonstrating in Kisumu county will only demonstrate when the party leader says so.” He said anybody using demos to block roads is committing a criminal offence. The police will deal with such people accordingly, he added. “We will tell the police to deal with any person putting stones on the road. We don’t want people to come under the disguise of demos and block the roads, take money from people and even rob visitors. This is a criminal act,” Nyong’o said. He said demonstrations must be peaceful and be part of civil disobedience and not violence. Anybody found molesting a citizen or resident will be treated as a criminal, Nyong’o added.
