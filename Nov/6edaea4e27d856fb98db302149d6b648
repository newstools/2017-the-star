Former Ford Kenya's candidate for woman representative seat Trans Nzoia county Christine Tanguli,has filled an application to withdraw a petition that was challenging the reelection of Janet Nangabo. Tanguli who lost to Jubilee’s Janet Nangabo in her petition claimed that her name was allegedly replaced making it difficult for the voter to identify with her at the ballot paper. She claimed that the second name ‘Soita’ appearing on the ballot paper during the Election Day was wrong as the voters were used to her name ‘Tanguli’. Tanguli said she wants the IEBC to explain why her name was changed. She also alleged that the electoral process was marred with election malpractices. The respondents in the petition were independent electron and bounderis commission, Janet Nangabo and Bilha Kiptuge who was the county returning officer. The IEBC and Nangabo were represented by lawyer Kinyanjui Njuguna while bilha kiptuge was represented by Wandabwa advocates. " All parties wishes petition terminated, Mr Wanyama needs time to seek instructions on the application to strike it out, its only fair to allow him time to do so as this is likely to amicably bring petition to an end," read a statement on the application. If the application is successful the members of the public must be issued with notice on the same. In the August elections Tanguli garnered 85 628 losing to Janet Nangabo who garnered 98 752votes. In a statement that was made through her lawyer Dennis Wanyama yesterday in Kitale court, she stated that she does not wish to proceed with the petition. The hearing of the petition was to begin yesterday. Despite the application filed to withdraw the petition, the Petitioner had not yet deposited the requisite security for cost and so the case would not have been heard. Tanguli was among the 10 nominees whose names were forwarded to the county assembly for consideration and approval as County Executive Committee Members (CEC) for health docket.
