 Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe arrived at a university graduation ceremony in the capital on Friday, his first public appearance since a military seizure of power. Political sources say the seizure is aimed at ending his 37-year rule. Wearing a blue and yellow academic gown and mortar board hat, the 93-year-old sat in large wooden chair at the front the hall.  He was greeted by ululations from the crowd as he declared the ceremony open.
