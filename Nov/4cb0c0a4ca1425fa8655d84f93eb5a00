The call for secession by Coast leaders may scuttle Deputy President William Ruto’s 2022 game plan. Ruto is banking on the Coast region as one of his key vote baskets. He is said to be looking for the right man at the Coast and this could well be Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho. The DP has already roped in former Mombasa Senator Hassan Omar to lure the region’s professionals to his side. Joho is popular among the youth, who are the majority among the 1.7 million voters at the Coast. The bitter verbal wars between Joho and Ruto have also subsided. Political pundits feel this may be a significant, deliberate move by the two politicians. Philip Mbaji, a political analyst, says Ruto should not worry about agitation for self-rule. Mbaji says Ruto is “a man of many political schemes”. Insiders in Ruto’s camp say they have earmarked Joho for talks and unconfirmed reports indicate they met prior to the August 8 election. Should the Coast secede it will mean Ruto misses out on at least 1.7 million votes registered at the Coast. However, should Ruto identify Joho as his pointman at the Coast, there could be another round of friction between the governor and Omar, who has joined Jubilee. Omar and Joho do not see eye to eye. The former senator is opposed to the secession agenda. On Sunday, he said, “There is nothing to suggest that the 2010 Constitution makes provisions that grant any person or group the right to pursue processes intended to undermine the territory of Kenya.” He spoke during a press conference with other Jubilee leaders at Mombasa Beach Hotel.
