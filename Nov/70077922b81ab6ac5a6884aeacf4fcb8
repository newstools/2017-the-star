The Kisii High Court will today rule on a petitioner's application to withdraw from a case challenging the election of Governor James Ongwae. Third petitioner Lumumba Nyaberi filed the application seeking to withdraw from the petition. Nyaberi petitioned Ongwae's win alongside Joel Makori and Francis Omao. The other petitioners have opposed Nyaberi's bid to withdraw his petition. But Ongwae's lawyers have welcome the application. “We are not objecting to the proposal for withdrawal because we were duly served,” lawyer Charles Rigoro said. Justice Hellen Omondi had allowed other petitioners request to have the application argued out in court before giving her ruling.
