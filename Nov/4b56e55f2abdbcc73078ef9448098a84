Laikipia residents yesterday took to the streets to celebrate after the Supreme Court upheld President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto’s victory yesterday. Led by Governor Ndiritu Muriithi and DeputyGovernor John Mwaniki, they congratulated the President and the apex court. They said the will of the people had prevailed. Muriithi said Kenyan can now return to nation building. For his part, Mwaniki urged the President and the DP to quickly embark on a mission to reconcile and heal the nation which was polarised by the General Election.  “We need everybody on board so that we have an inclusive government,” he said.  At the Nanyuki bus terminus, matatu operators, led Ngunjiri Martin, welcomed the court ruling, saying the transport sector was badly affected by political uncertainity.
