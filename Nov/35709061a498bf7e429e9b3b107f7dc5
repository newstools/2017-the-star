Safaricom has ordered Challa Communications to refund people billed more than once while checking KCPE examination results. Some 424,011 requests were affected, director of strategy Joe Ogutu said in a statement on Thursday.  Candidates, guardians and schools were asked to send their index numbers to short code 22252 to receive their results.   Each message cost Sh25 so the company will part with at least Sh10.6 million. Many Kenyans sent their index numbers but some did not get any feedback.  "We have instructed [Challa] to refund all affected customers starting this afternoon," Ogutu said. The director said the refund targets those who queried the system more than once, and those who may have been billed without receiving any response. But he noted Challa had informed them of a technical challenge that meant customers who sent queries experienced delays. "We have initiated a full investigation with to ensure customers are not over-charged for their use." Ogutu said the telecommunications giant remains focused on resolving the issue for the continued benefit of subscribers. "...and we shall extend our support to Challa to help resolve any future technical issues that caused this incident," he said. Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i announced the results on Tuesday.
