For the last eight years the health sector has had a mixture of success and failure, Vision 2030 delivery secretariat has said. Speaking at Radisson Blu Hotel in Nairobi, Vision 2030 director general Julius Muia said the sector realised an overall 56 per cent implementation rate. He spoke at a one-day policy forum focusing on disseminating evidence from research studies, relevant policy lessons and innovations in health, water and sanitation.  The event was jointly organised with Innovations for Poverty Action. It brought together local and international researchers, policy makers, donors, and implementers.  The forum aims to discuss improvement in health, water, sanitation and hygiene. Muia said a questionnaire was administered to 77 Implementers of Vision 2030 in June. Various sectors of Vision 2030 pillars were assessed.  The secretariat placed health in position seven after scoring 5.6 out of 10. Infrastructure was first with 7.1, Energy ( 6.6 ), ICT (6.6), Education and training (6.2), Devolution (6.2) and financial services (6). Muia said 218 water purification points and 99 bore holes were completed in 2012/13 at a cost of Sh20 million, compared to 247 water purification points and 263 boreholes drilled in 2016/17 at a cost of Sh54 million. Muia said there is need to develop linkages between Health, Water and Environment sectors.  There is also need for partnerships between the national and county governments; non-state actors; development partners and communities, he added.  There is an improvement in the ranking of Kenya’s health indicators in the Global Competitiveness Index in the last eight years in Malaria and Tuberculosis, while other areas have stagnated. Kenya’s ranking in health indicators was low in 2008-9 at 117 out of 134 countries compared to 2015-16 at 101 out of 140.  Health CS Cleopa Mailu, in a speech read on his behalf by the director of public health Dr Kepha Ombacho, said sustainable development goals demonstrate renewed global commitment in tackling health challenges. This SDGs address all major health priorities including maternal and child health, communicable and non-communicable diseases and access to safe, effective and quality and affordable medicines, he said.  Mailu said the SGDs also call for increased health financing and more research and more evidenced based policy making.
