Jubilee leaders have told off NASA over giving ultimatums for talks. NASA has described  the October 26 election as a ‘sham’, but Jubilee insists it was free and fair. Devolution CS Mwangi Kiunjuri described NASA chief Raila Odinga as a man hungry for power. He said in the coalition government in which Raila was Prime Minister, he frustrated the presidency. Kiunjuri said the Constitution states that the party that wins the election forms an all-inclusive government. “The Constitution does not state that a certain community or family should be in government for it to be inclusive.”  He spoke at the funeral of former Cabinet minister Kabeere M’mbijiwe in  Marimba, South Imenti, Meru. The CS said even if the country will go back to the polls, President  Uhuru Kenyatta will continue being President until a new one is sworn in.
