Kirinyaga deputy governor Peter Ndambiri on Wednesday led a protest march in Mwea against area MP Kabinga Wachira. He claimed the MP is crafting a scheme to destabilise Governor Anne Waiguru's administration. Ndambiri claimed Kabinga held meeting with some MCAs on Sunday where the alleged sabotage plan was discussed. The protesters waved placards and twigs as they marched across Ngurubani town along Embu-Mwea road. They condemned the MP terming him as an enemy of development, further accusing him of soliciting bribes from locals with a promise to give them jobs. Ndambiri told journalists that the legislator is fighting the governor after he failed to secure jobs for his cronies. "We don't want to start fighting our own government which has done a lot of us," the DG said. "We already have the deputy governor, two CEC slots, and three positions of chief officers. Those saying we are sidelined are our enemies." The leaders articulated several projects which the county government is planning to roll out for Mwea people. Ndambiri said the MP and the MCAs in his camp are being bankrolled by a flamboyant Kirinyaga politician. They claimed the woman has trained her guns on the governor seat in 2022. But Kabinga denied the bribery allegations adding that he has no plan to sabotage the county government. He challenged those he may have asked money from to step forward and report to the police. "We can't start maligning the name of others leaders just because of political expeditions." Kabinga said he has no personal grudge with Governor Waiguru or the DG but asked them to stop attacking him unnecessarily. Â
