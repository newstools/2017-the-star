Traders in Narok town lost more than Sh20 million when their business premises were swept away by floods at the weekend. Narok Kenya Chamber of Commerce chairman David Mpatiany blamed the flooding on poor drainage. Speaking to the Star in Narok town yesterday, he said buildings on waterways block the flow and contributed to the flooding. The Nairobi- Narok- Bomet Road was blocked for most of the weekend. Hundreds of commuters, including tourists visiting the Masai Mara Game Reserve, were stranded for several hours. Ann Nyambura, who owns a cosmetics shop, said the water rushed in suddenly and swept away Sh100,000 stock, as she rescued her children. Clothes vendor Peter Mwaura said he fled for his life and saved nothing.
