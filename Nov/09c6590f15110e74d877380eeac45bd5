An AP officer based in Laikipia and two Nyumba Kumi Initiative members will remain in custody at the Nanyuki police station, pending investigations into the death of a 14-year-old boy.  The three, together with the officer’s wife Gladys Wairimu, were accused of killing the boy, Justus Mwangi, two weeks ago in South Imenti village, Laikipa county. The officer, George Waweru, 24, appeared before a Nanyuki court alongside Samuel Chege, 43, and Amos Wainaina, 58, on suspicion that they tortured Mwangi to death on October 25. The three were, however, not formally charged with murder after the prosecution asked for more time to complete investigations. Caroline Muriu told the court the three are suspected to have participated in beating the boy, causing his death because they suspected he had stolen a transistor radio and Sh700 cash from Wairimu. Principal magistrate Waititu Gichimu on Tuesday ordered the three remanded at the station and produced again on November 13, when they are expected to face murder charges.
