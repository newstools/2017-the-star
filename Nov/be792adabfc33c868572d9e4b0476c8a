Actress and singer Patricia loves reading books, and her father played a very big role by encouraging her to read books, considering he wasn't interested in seeing her pursue music. "My father used to tell me all these weird things and I used to believe until I was like 18 years, when I realised that they were not realistic," Patricia said. "But it grew in my imagination so much, he fed me with all these books. I think by the the time I was eight years old, I had devoured so many books. I would go shopping to the supermarket, buy two books, the first one I finish at 11am and the other one at 2pm. They were like new but I'm done." She revealed that her dad "got me this library card and my brains were filled with this vocabulary, stories and characters".
