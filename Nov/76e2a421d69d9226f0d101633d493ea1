Miraa farmers have moved to court seeking an order to quash NACADA's directive to regulate consumption of the stimulant. The drugs control body wants the consumption restricted to between 5pm and 10pm. But aggrieved farmers and traders have accused the agency of executing the directive illegally. Through lawyer Henry Kurauka, they told Justice Chacha Mwita that NACADA has no legal mandate to restrict time for miraa consumption.  Their argument is that other substances such as tobacco and alcohol are regulated through a parliamentary legislation. "The action by the agency has adversely affected the marketing of the crop in many countries," he said. Kurauka further told the judge that NACADA has intensified a negative campaign, which offends Article 10, 40 and 46 of the constitution, that guarantees consumer rights. "Miraa is scientifically classified as a mind stimulant just like coffee and tea which have no times for consumption," the lawyer said in his submission on Friday. "The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substance Control Act of 1994 does not list miraa as one of the prohibited substances." The lawyer told the judge the action by the agency was against the government's aim of reducing poverty and lowering the cost of living among miraa farmers. "There is no national interest, threat and convenience to bar farming, trading, marketing and consumption of the crop."  The judge directed that NACADA and Attorney General Githu Muigai be served with the petition. The matter will be mentioned on November 17 when further directions will be given. Â
