The Government has suspended NHIF's limit to outpatient services until further notice. The National Hospital Insurance Fund had fixed the visits to a maximum of four per year. In a statement, Health CS Dr Cleopa Mailu said the move has been suspended with immediate. He called on patients to continue enjoying unlimited services as has been the case before. "The cabinet secretary of Health has suspended with immediate effect the decision by NHIF to limit the outpatient visits to only four per year until further notice. This is until further consultations are held between the NHIF board and other stakeholders," the statement read.

CEO Geoffrey Mwangi said that it will no longer be a requirement for members to receive outpatient services in a facility they had initially selected. According to the old system, it was a requirement that you only access outpatient services in the hospitals that you earlier chose. Previously, members were restricted. They were supposed to furnish NHIF with a list of hospitals they prefer at the beginning of each year. “In line with these changes, members will no longer co-pay as was previously the case and will continue enjoying the same benefits package,” CEO Geoffrey Mwangi said in a statement.
