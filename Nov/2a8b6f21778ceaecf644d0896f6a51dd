To reduce the bloated wage bill, the county will spend Sh1.5 billion as a send-off package for older workers taking early retirement. Governor Mike Sonko is keen to cut the wage bill of Sh1.2 billion a month for more than 13,000 employees. MCAs have been asked to approve the expenditure. A generous package awaits employees who retire early. At least 5,000 workers are aged 50 and older and a majority of them have expressed willingness to take early retirement, officials say. “Those willing to take early retirement shall be handsomely paid and due process shall be followed,” Sonko said in a statement on Monday. Former Governor Evans Kidero had complained about the wage bill, attributing it to slow development in the city. He said most county revenue was used to pay salaries. “I am pleased to announce the county government has received a Sh1.5 billion package for our staff who are due for retirement by end of this year,” Sonko said. Acting county secretary Leboo Ole Morintat said the money was raised by the county. . Sonko said that 70 per cent of the county’s workforce was aging hence the need for a retirement programme for them. He said most of them are either semiskilled or unskilled. “Out of 13,000 workers, 8,800 are support staff. 27 per cent are operational staff and only one percent is strategic staff,” Sonko said. Only 400 county employees are aged 30 and below. Sonko’s assessment was based on a county assembly report released earlier in the year. It recommended a halt to hiring until expenditure on wages and salaries drops to 32 per cent. It stands at more than 50 per cent.
