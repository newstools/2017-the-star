Kisumu county secretary Olang’o Onudi has raised the alarm over a fake jobs racket. He distanced himself from a cartel masquerading as job brokers in the county and warned the public to be wary.  Onudi said he has reported the matter to the police to investigate two numbers used to solicit bribes from job seekers. “The numbers are 0753582098 and 0743109227. I have never asked anybody to seek any favour to be employed at the county government,” he said. He added that those behind the cartel have been sending messages to people, including senior county officers, over alleged jobs in the past three weeks. “These are thugs. I can assure the public that police will arrest them,” Onudi said. He spoke yesterday amid an outcry from the public over the cartel that has conned job seekers out of huge amounts of money. He said a number of victims informed them of the racket. Onudi said the county has the capacity to advertise for county jobs for competitive recruitment.  Onudi told hose seeking for jobs to be alert and avoid giving cash for non-exitent jobs.
