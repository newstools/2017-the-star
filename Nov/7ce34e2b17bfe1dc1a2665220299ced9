More than 200 students of Moi University's Nairobi campus who completed studies in December last year fear missing out in next month's graduation. The graduation is set for December 21. Lecturers have withheld the students' marks, protesting nonpayment of their salaries. Some students claimed they have not seen their marks and scripts for the entire four years. And some of the students drawn from various disciplines have missed graduations twice over missing marks. Some 50 students have written to VC Laban Ayiro over the matter. They expressed difficulties in accessing their full marks and provisional transcripts to enable them confirm results and plan for graduation. "In most cases we would be shown incomplete results where a whole class is missing marks for some units with reasons that some lecturers are yet to submit our marks or, some lecturers are withholding our marks and scripts due to unpaid arrears by the university," the letter reads in part. They urged Ayiro to intervene in the matter and enable them get their marks and transcripts so they can graduate next month. A journalist, who is among the affected students, said they have been meeting heads of departments but have not been assisted. "They have been promising us the issue will be resolved, but the lecturers have also been telling us nothing is being done to resolve the matter," the journalist, who did not want to be named, said.
