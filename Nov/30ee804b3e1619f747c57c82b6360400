A man who went into hiding after he defiled a nursery schoolgirl in Matathia village, Kijabe ward, Lari constituency, has been arrested.  Area OCPD Odhiambo Wambia yesterday said the suspect, 36, molested the girl months ago when he carried her on a motorcycle. Speaking at his office, he said the man, who is a relative of the girl, stopped the
motorcycle and started fondling her and molested her. He then warned the little girl not to tell anyone. However, her teachers noticed she walked strangely and asked her to tell them what had happened. “The teachers called her mother and reported to her what had
happened. She was taken to Tigoni Subcounty hospital where she was treated and
discharged,” Wambia said.  "Let us not talk about who he is to her, but the investigations are
ongoing and we shall know that." He said when the suspect learnt he had been
reported to the police, he went into hiding. “We have been looking for him. Members of the public helped
us with leads of his whereabouts until we arrested him,” Wambia said.
