A 16-year-old girl has died from excessive consumption of illicit brew at their home in Soko Mjinga, Maralal town, Samburu County. Relatives said the girl had been warned severally against heavy drinking. "A doctor had diagnosed a serious problem with her and advised her to stop drinking alcohol, an advice she defied," said one of her friends. Her mother died recently, also from alcoholism. “I know this girl, her death might have been caused by drinking alcohol. She came to a hospital where I work, she was admitted and later advised against drinking alcohol as she was discharged,” Solomon Ekiru, a resident of Soko Mjinga said. The residents asked the government to launch a crackdown on illicit brew which according to them, is rampant in the area. “We are tired of losing youths because of alcohol, even if it is a must that you drink, then drink in controlled amounts,” Lucy Waithaka, a resident of Maralal town advised. She said excessive consumption of alcohol among youths in the area has corrupted their behaviour and exposed them to many risks. The body was taken to Samburu county referral hospital mortuary.
