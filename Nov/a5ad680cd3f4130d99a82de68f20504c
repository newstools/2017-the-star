More than 400 delegates from Kwale county attended the swearing in of President Uhuru Kenyatta at the Kasarani Sports Centre on Tuesday. Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya led other Jubilee supporters from the county to Nairobi. “We went to Nairobi in large numbers for the inauguration ceremony as a clear indication of our total support for Uhuru, DP William Ruto and the Jubilee administration,” he said. Mvurya campaigned vigorously for Jubilee and Uhuru in the repeat polls of November 26 after the Supreme Court nullified the first presidential election of August 8. He urged to vote for Uhuru for development citing various ongoing projects implemented by the Jubilee government.
