NASA’s six-point political “revolution” strategy in its pursuit for electoral justice is causing jitters in the Jubilee administration. Opposition’s political rallies, boycott of some products, secession calls and threats to swear in NASA leader Raila Odinga as head of state if President Uhuru Kenyatta is sworn in have puzzled many in Jubilee. Jubilee leadership is also worried by the decision of county assemblies in perceived NASA zones to pass opposition motions in addition to Raila’s diplomatic push. NASA leadership maintains it will not go outside the Constitution in its push for the revolt – through the National Resistance Movement wing. “We are using the law and the Constitution in this revolution. During the Kanu regime, we wanted multi-partism, but President Daniel Moi said ‘no’. Then we went to the people, did we get multi-partism or not?” NASA lead lawyer James Orengo asked. The Siaya Senator spoke on Sunday in a rally in Jacaranda Grounds, Embakasi East constituency, Nairobi. NASA chief executive Norman Magaya yesterday said their basket is full with options to help them execute the revolution plan that “will leave Jubilee regretting”. “We are not short of options and in a few days, we will tell you the best one. The plan we have is that things will never be the same. In a few days, Jubilee will regret not paying attention to us,” he said. If the Supreme Court upholds Uhuru’s reelection, then he will be sworn in on November 28. NASA leaders say they do not recognise the repeat presidential election held on October 26 and have vowed to swear in Raila using the August 8 presidential results “in the IEBC servers.” “I can tell you without fear of contradiction that if they swear in Uhuru, we’ll swear in Raila. Never again shall we allow ourselves to be treated like strangers in our country,” Magaya said.
