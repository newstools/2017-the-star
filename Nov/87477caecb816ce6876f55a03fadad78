Police have arrested a suspected terrorist who had locked himself up in a hotel in Eldoret town on Wednesday. Area OCPD Samuel Mutunga said the man claimed to be a retired KDF solder and had been at the hotel for three days. "We have him in custody and will hand him over to the anti-terror unit to establish his mission," he said. The facility's operators said the suspect booked the room last Sunday and had not come out since. They said he refused to talk to anyone and seemed suspicious. Police knocked the door for more than one hour but the man did not open, forcing them to break in. "He was found with a mobile phone and a Kenyan national ID," the OCPD said. Mutunga asked members of the public to work with police to reduce crime. Â
