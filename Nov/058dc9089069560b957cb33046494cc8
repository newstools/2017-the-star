The IEBC has said the Supreme Court ruling affirms their commitment to conducting free and fair elections. The six-judge bench dismissed petitions challenging President Uhuru Kenyatta's election and upheld his victory. IEBC chair Wafula Chebukati said they will wait for the court's full judgement in 21 days to evaluate the October 26 poll. "We await the judgement to inform our post-election evaluation that is about to commence as well as initiatives focused on developing our institution and enhancing electoral democracy," Chebukati said in a statement. A week before the repeat election, Chebukati said that with a divided commission, he could not guarantee its credibility. But he did not resign as expected and went ahead to lead the commission in conducting the poll. He made the statement shortly after commissioner Roselyn Akombe resigned for the same reasons.
