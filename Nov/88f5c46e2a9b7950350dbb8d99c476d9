Former Embu senator Lenny Kivuti has accused Governor Martin Wambora of deliberately delaying an election petition against him. Kivuti Friday told the election petition court that Wambora was keen on delaying the case to avoid losing his seat. Kivuti’s lawyer Tom Ojienda said Wambora had filed an application to strike off the petition before it is fully heard and determined. “He is doing so because he fears he will lose,” Ojienda said. He told the court to dismiss the petition, saying it lacked merit. “The reasons given for the application are baseless, illogical and unlawful,” Ojienda said. Wambora’s lawyer Kithinji Marete filed the application.  Wambora accused Kivuti of interfering with ballot boxes at the premises where the court ordered that they be stored. Kivuti wants a recount of the votes. But Wambora says the process will be unfair to him because his rival interfered with the ballots.  Ojienda said the premises were opened and closed by constituency returning officers in the presence of police. Justice William Musyoka will rule on the application on Thursday.
