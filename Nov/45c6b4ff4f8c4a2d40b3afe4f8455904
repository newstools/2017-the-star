Three cattle rustlers on Tuesday drowned while trying to cross the River Ewaso Ng’iro with livestock stolen from Laikipia county. The three had stolen nine cows from Mukogodo Forest belonging to a village elder and were driving them towards Isiolo when they met their death. One body was retrieved yesterday. Five cows drowned. Yesterday, Laikipia county commissioner Onesmus Musyoki said police and villagers were still looking for the other two bodies. “The armed young men stole the animals belonging to Lempolio Lekwale, a member of Nyumba Kumi initiative, but drowned while crossing the swollen river heading to Lengurma village, Isiolo county. Four of the animals were rescued by police officers who were pursuing the raiders,” he said. Musyoki said Laikipia has become an easy target for armed cattle rustlers. This however is about to change with the recruitment and training of additional Kenya Police Reservists.
