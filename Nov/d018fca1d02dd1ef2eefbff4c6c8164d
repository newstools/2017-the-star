Three Garissa executives were yesterday sworn in, bringing the number of those who have taken the oath of office to nine. The ceremony was held at a Garissa hotel and presided over by chief magistrate Cosmas Maundu. Those in the lineup included Issa Yarrow (Livestock), Issa Dubow (Water) and Habiba Nasib (Education). Mohamed Shale (Lands) was vetted and approved by the county assembly alongside the three, but he was absent at the swearing in. Garissa Governor Ali Korane witnessed the ceremony. He said Shale will be sworn in at a private ceremony next week. He did not give reasons for his absence. Executives Adow Jubat (Trade), Abdi Omar Farah (Public Works), Ahmednadhir Omar (Health), Habon Maalim (Environment), Zeinab Abdi (Gender) and Roble Said (Finance) were sworn in two weeks ago. Korane said 146 candidates for the position of chief officers were shortlisted and interviewed by the county Public Service Board. Korane will nominate his preferred candidates from the list and present it to the assembly for vetting and approval from next week. Korane said this was one of the most competitive positions characterised by intense lobbying by those for and against certain candidates. “My biggest challenge will be picking the chief officers. Some people come to me either wanting to be nominated or pleading that I should not consider some individuals,” Korane said. In the previous administration Garissa county had 16 chief officers, but the governor has the discretion to either increase or reduce the number.
