Online hotel and flight portal Jumia hotel has opened local agencies in response to a market segment yet to adapt to the growing online trend. The offline presence is expected to lead the largely web-based company in gaining greater share of the local market still dependant on conventional mortar and brick business. This comes at a time when domestic travel continue to maintain a positive trajectory, with an impressive 14.6 per cent growth in 2016 amounting to 3.6 million bed nights as compared to 2015 when it recorded 3.1 million bed nights uptake. “As much as we celebrate the remarkable growth of the online marketplace, we must not forget the segment of customers who do not have this knowledge and skills, those who do not have adequate access to broadband and those who simply prefer more human interaction,” Jumia Travel Kenya Country Manager Cyrus Onyiego said in a statement. The offline presence is meant to appeal to the traveler still wary or not conversant with the internet of things. According to the 2017 Phocuswright report, 45 per cent of tour and attraction transactions are currently happening offline.
