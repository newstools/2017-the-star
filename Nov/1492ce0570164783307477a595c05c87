Farmers in Nyandarua have been advised against spraying cows using the same hand-spray pumps they use to spray fungicides and other farm chemicals. This causes blindness in their animals. Tobias Maina from Twiga Chemicals yesterday said many farmers have been complaining that the pesticides they use to control ticks cause blindness in their animals. “The same chemicals are used in cattle dips and animals taken to the dips do not lose their sight,” he said. Maina (pictured) spoke at Ol Kalou Dairies Ltd during the annual farmers’ field day. He said the molecules contained in pesticides used in tick control and those in fungicides and other farm chemicals are different. Maina added that farmers use the same hand-spray pumps they use in their farms on their cows without cleaning them. When the molecules mix, he said, they cause blindness in the animals.  He said the hand-sprays used in the farms should be thoroughly cleaned.
