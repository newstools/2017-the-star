Children found breaking the law during the school holidays will be arrested, Mumias police boss Peter Kattam has said. The police boss also warned they will take legal action on any parent found to have intentionally placed their children in the harm’s way. He told parents to keep an eye on their children during this Christmas holidays. “If we find a child who has broken the law, we will arrest him and charge him as a juvenile,” Kattam said. He said they have seen students going to movies at night, especially during the weekends. “If we find them loitering at night, we will question them,” he said. Kattam also said children are given motorcycles to ride without a driving licence. He spoke in Mumias on Tuesday.  Kattam spoke after two children were reported to have died in the area. Two weeks ago, a seven-year-old boy drowned in Matungu subcounty after he was sent by his uncle to retrieve a water bucket from a well.
