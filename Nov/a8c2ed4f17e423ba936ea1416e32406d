A fresh crackdown will be launched to wipe out illicit brews, which are back in the market, Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago has said.  "We will not accept what is happening because the illicit brews are ruining the lives of many Kenyans," he said. Mandago said security agencies have relaxed in the war on illicit brews and second-generation alcohol. Mandago asked Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet to investigate the alleged illegal use of Kenya Railways wagons to transport illicit brews from Uganda. "We will raid them in the bush and stop the train. We will act but we won't uproot the railway like some people," he said. Mandago spoke at the launch of the Wellness Week for county staff on He said his team is already following up the matter. "The only way we can deliver quality services to mwananchi is by ensuring we have a strong and healthy workforce and this is why we are conducting the wellness week," Mandago said. The governor further asked county staff to make it a habit of doing regular exercises as a way of keeping fit and healthy.
