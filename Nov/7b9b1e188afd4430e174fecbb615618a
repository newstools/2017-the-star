Former Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo has revealed his own tally of the August 8 election showed incumbent Elisha Odhiambo won the race. However, he maintained his petition is grounded on the irregularities in the poll process, which he argued affected the result. Midiwo spoke during a cross-examination in the case challenging Odhiambo’s win at the High Court in Siaya on Wednesday.  Midiwo said the process was not free and fair and did not reflect the wishes of the constituents. Previously, Midiwo had said he didn’t know who won the Gem election, before he was taken to task to admit Odhiambo’s victory. Odhiambo won the election with 34,680 votes against Midiwo’s 29,341. Midiwo alleged the process was marred by violence, intimidation and corruption. Odhiambo’s lawyers dismissed the allegations, adding Midiwo was the one who used violence and intimidated voters.
