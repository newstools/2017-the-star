Atheists yesterday termed unconstitutional, a decision by Attorney General Githu Muigai to suspend their operations. Members of the Atheists Society of Kenya told a court in Nairobi to compel the registrar of society to recognise them. They told High Court Judge Chacha Mwita, the atheists said their deregistration was an infringement of their rights. “We are being denied a chance to exercise our beliefs including the right to hold that there is no God,” Atheists Society of Kenya president Harrison Mumia said. Atheists Society of Kenya was registered under the society act on February 17, 2016.  Two month’s later, the AG suspended its registration.  Githu said he had received presentations from religious groups and other organisations, questioning the legality of the registration of atheists. “The Attorney General has directed the Register of Societies to suspend, with immediate effect, the said registration until the propriety, legality and constitutionality of the registration is determined by the Supreme Court,” a letter from Githu’s office stated. Mumia told the court the AG’s actions violated the rights of members. He told the court the registrar of society has not given them reasons for the suspension of their registration as is required by law. “We were not even given a chance to defend ourselves as is required by law,” Mumia said. He said their suspension was against article 47 of the Constitution. The article demands a fair, reasonable and procedural administrative action. “The decision was malicious, in bad faith and a violation of the Constitution,” Mumia said. The AG want the suit dismissed, saying it lacked merit. He told the court yesterday that the group did not object to deregistration. “They cannot say they were unfairly deregistered yet they never protested,” Githu said. Judgement was set for January 26, 2018.
