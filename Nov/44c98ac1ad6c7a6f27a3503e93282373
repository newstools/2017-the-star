Kwale
woman representative Zuleikha Juma has condemned the alleged brutal killing of National
Resistance Movement supporters by police. They were
killed during protests when NASA leader Raila Odinga jetted back into the country on Friday. "You
should not be used by your bosses to fulfil their heartless deeds. It is wrong
to beat innocent people, who are unarmed and their only mistake was to welcome
their leader," Juma said. She said in Zimbambwe police took over leadership with no bloodshed. Zuleikha spoke at Maasai Ground in Msambweni on Saturday. She was
accompanied by area MP Suleiman Dori, politician Mshenga Ruga and several MCAs. Dori said they
will follow directives issued by their leader Raila as long as it is for the
benefit of Kenyans. Raila claimed anti-riot police officers killed 15 of his supporters who had turned up to
welcome him on Friday after his US trip. He on
Saturday said he had visited the city mortuary and established police had
"mercilessly terminated 15 young lives whose mistake was just to turn out
and welcome their leader". Raila spoke at Okoa Kenya Secretariat after visiting various hospitals, where some
of the victims of police brutality had been admitted.
