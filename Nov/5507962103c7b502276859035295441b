Former nominated MP Oburu Oginga has threatened to sue those spreading false reports that he recently met Jubilee leaders to negotiate for a post-election deal with NASA.  Oburu said he will meet his lawyers today and institute a legal suit against those spreading the “rumours”. Oburu also denied reports that he recently negotiated a post-election deal between NASA and Jubilee ahead of yesterday’s swearing-in of President Uhuru Kenyatta. Oburu, who is the eldest brother of NASA leader Raila Odinga, described the reports as outrageous, saying they were aimed at tarnishing his reputation. He said he is not a NASA principal to engage in any talks with Jubilee on behalf of the opposition alliance. “It is not true that Uhuru sent anybody to me for the purported discussions,” Oburu said yesterday.  He was speaking on Mayienga FM.He challenged anyone to ask Raila or NASA co-principals Kalonzo Musyoka, Musalia Mudavadi or Moses Wetangula if they are aware of any talks with Jubilee on a post-election pact. Yesterday, the Star reported that Oburu met Leader of the Majority in the National Assembly Aden Duale, who reached out to the NASA principals through him.  Oburu confirmed he met Duale twice. He said the meeting was about the impending vetting of names of those to represent Kenya in the East African Legislative Assembly. The names will be debated next week.  Oburu is among those who have applied for nomination to EALA. He said his meeting with Duale was to canvas for his inclusion in the list of EALA nominees through the support of Jubilee MPs.  “Yes, I met Duale, Deputy Speaker Moses Cheboi and Jubilee Chief Whip Benjamin Washiali over tea. I asked them to support my candidature once it is tabled in Parliament,” Oburu said. He asked NASA supporters to ignore the “rumours.”
