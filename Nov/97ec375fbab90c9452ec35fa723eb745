Nakuru Governor Lee Kinyanjui has called upon the aircraft accident department to conduct speedy investigations to establish the cause of the Lake Nakuru helicopter crash. He said the families of the five victims who perished during the October 21 accident want to know the cause. “After the rescue team retrieved the copter wreck, Kenyans want to know the report once the investigations are complete,” Kinyanjui said. He spoke on Saturday during the burial of Veronica Muthoni, one of the plane crash victims. The burial was done in Bahati, Nakuru county.  Other leaders in attendance include Senator Susan Kihika, speaker Maina Kairu, Woman Representative Liza Chelule and MP Kimani Ngunjiri. Parents and relatives of the other victims also attended the burial. Kihika praised Veronica’s family for standing firm in their faith their daughter would be found despite some people advising they call off the search. “I had not met Veronica’s family before this tragedy hit us, but since then I’ve come to appreciate their strong faith in God. And as a testimony to that faith, Veronica’s body was found intact despite the long time it has spent in water,” she said.  Kihika criticised the irresponsible use of social media. She said it was necessary to establish the facts before sharing information on social media. Kihika also urged users to be sensitive to the families affected.
