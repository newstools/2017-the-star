Nakuru CID detectives are searching for a woman accused of stabbing rugby player Mike Okombe to death. They noted on Monday that Maryanne Mumbi did not present herself to police with her lawyer as claimed. It had been said that Mumbi, who lives in Nakuru town, had presented herself to the CID. But officer Joseph Koin said: "We have not arrested her, and neither has she presented herself at any of our stations." Koin termed the allegations "mere speculations" but noted officers have intensified the search and will soon arrest the suspect. He added they were still looking into the circumstances under which Okombe was stabbed. The officer said preliminary investigations indicated the Nakuru RFC player was killed at a friend's house at Olive Inn estate in Rongai constituency during a birthday party on Saturday night. Okombe is said to have died upon arrival at Nakuru hospital. The victim born on May 4, 1990 played for Kenya Fifteens as an open side flanker and was to join Kabras Sugar for the new season.
