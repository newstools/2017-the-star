Property was on Monday destroyed after a dormitory was razed to the ground at the Michuki Technical Training Institute in Kangema subcounty, Murang’a. Area deputy county commissioner William Lenaremo said the fire started minutes to 5pm, when students were having prayers for their Knec exams that will start today.  Lenaremo said they suspect the fire was started by an electrical fault but they will investigate to establish the exact cause. He, however, confirmed there were no casualties and that fire fighters were able to extinguish the fire before it spread to a nearby dormitory. He added that only a small group of the students were in school to sit the exams.  “The dormitory housedabout 70 but the majority have gone home for the holidays,” he said.  The institute has a total of 1,070 students.
