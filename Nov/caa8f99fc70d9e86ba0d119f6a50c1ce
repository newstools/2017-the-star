Former Kisumu Governor Jack Ranguma yesterday suffered a petition setback after a court denied his request for scrutiny and recount of votes. The petition case, however, continues. Ranguma had made the scrutiny and recount request through his lawyer Richard Onsongo, citing irregularities.  Ranguma had accused winner Anyang’ Nyong’o of conspiring with the IEBC to rig him out in the August 8 polls. Yesterday, High Court judge David Majanja termed the request defective.  Majanja said the defect is aggravated by the fact the petitioners applied for a recount and retallying of all votes cast in the county for governor. He said applications seeking scrutiny and a recount of votes must be accompanied by a list of specific polling stations to be scrutinised. Broad application Majanja said the application was broad and vague and could not form the basis of an order for scrutiny. “I’m not convinced at this stage it would be appropriate to make the orders sought. Perhaps the examination and cross examination of the respondent’s witnesses, and more particularly returning officers, may convince me to act ‘suo motu’ [on my own initiative]. But now the order I can make is to dismiss the application,” he said. On Tuesday, Ranguma said, “The IEBC officials were able to access the servers, edit results and make a declaration in favour of Nyong’o.” In his affidavit, Ranguma claimed many electoral malpractices were committed during voting and transmission of results.  Ranguma told the court his agents were denied access to some polling stations and the tallying centre. “There was also failure to mark and secure spoilt votes,” he said.
