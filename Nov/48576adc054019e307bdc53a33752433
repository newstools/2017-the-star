A power battle is brewing between Lamu Governor Fahim Twaha and the Public Service Board after the county chief rejected 14 candidates shortlisted for the positions of chief officer in various departments. He yesterday said he rejected the list because it was not inclusive as required by the Constitution. The 14 candidates have been interviewed and vetted by the board. Twaha said, “The shortlisting wasn’t done as per the law. I got the feeling that approving such a list will cause  trouble and I don’t want us to reach there.” However, PSB chairman Ali Mbwarali wondered how Twaha knew who was shortlisted, yet the list is yet to be handed over to him. Mbwarali said the board hadn’t  reached the final stage of releasing the names to the governor’s office for approval and said it is ‘weird’ Twaha reacted to a list he hadn’t seen. The 14 positions of chief officer were advertised and attracted 452 applications. He said the 14 are yet to be interviewed.   ‘We will follow law’ Mbwarali said the board will follow the law. “The official position of the board is that we haven’t finalised the selection of the candidates. They are due to undergo further scrutiny and interviews, after which, their names will be presented to the governor for approval. All procedures shall be adhered to and we shall do so without any form of interferance or intimidation,” he said Mbwarali continued, “It’s wrong to speculate and make decisions over something you haven’t even seen.”
