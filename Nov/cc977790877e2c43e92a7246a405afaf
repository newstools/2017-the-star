Njambi Koikai has been battling a condition known as endometriosis for the last 18 years, but the last two years, it has been worse, when she started having chest pains. Her struggle with the illness has been highlighted numerously on various media outlets. Speaking to Adelle Onyango and Shaffie Weru on Kiss FM yesterday, Njambi said the first time she really understood what was ailing her body was when a woman called Cindy reached out to her on Facebook and asked her if her lungs collapse during her periods. She found it strange because her lungs would only collapse during that time. That is when Cindy told her she is having a reproductive health issue and she should go see a doctor. Njambi went and was diagnosed with thoracic endometriosis. “I have never met Cindy, we just speak on the phone because she is so busy and she has also been battling with many issues. She calls me up and prays for me. And she is always like 'Yoh, Njambi! I'm really rooting for you.' She also went though the same thing but hers wasn't as serious as mine.”  This year alone, Njambi has undergone 10 surgeries. She found a specialist in Atlanta and the treatment would cost her Sh10m. So far, she has raised Sh4.5 million. She said she spoke out about it is because her family inspired and supported her. It was also easier for her because she had dealt with cancer. Also, she has never been afraid of speaking up. She said she is not going to die yet; she can be helped. She is also not afraid of anything. Njambi concluded: "In the ghetto we say, 'Tunaogopa Mungu, stima na njaa pekee'.”
