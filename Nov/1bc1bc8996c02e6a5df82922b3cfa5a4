The Council of Governors has set up a national committee to make funeral arrangements for Governor Wahome Gakuru. The committee will be co-chaired by ICT Cabinet Secretary Joe Mucheru and a representative from the CoG. Speaking at the CoG offices, chairman Josphat Nanok said the Nyeri government and the national government, with the support of the CoG, will foot all the funeral expenses. Nanok said another committee at the county level will be co-chaired by Nyeri Senator Ephraim Maina and Deputy Governor Mutahi Kahiga. The third committee involves family members and friends. "All the three committees will be involved in discussing the arrangements of the funeral and how we can be able to give a proper send of to our colleague," said Josphat. The date for the church services will be announced in due course as consultations with the family are ongoing on whether to hold them in Nairobi or Nyeri. Maina urged the media to be sensitive when reporting the death. Â
