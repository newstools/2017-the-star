WCB’s vice president and brother to bongo star Diamond
Platnumz brought Nairobi to a standstill last weekend. He was
performing at a popular Nairobi club, where he treated his new fans to a
number of mixes. Romy Jons, who is one of the most sought-after DJs in
Tanzania, is Diamond Platnumz’s deejay, and Word Is caught up with the Tanzanian
lad during his stay here. "It was my first time performing as RJ the DJ but I have performed a couple of times with Diamond Platnumz in Kenya." Jons, who has a large following on social media, especially
from the lasses, opened up about how he became a DJ and the struggles he
had to go through. "I started off as a radio presenter but I quit and went to work with my brother Diamond Platnumz. I started working at the station when Diamond was releasing his first song, so I pushed him." The DJ, however, distanced himself from the various controversies that have been facing his brother and his baby mamas lately. "Everybody chooses who they want to love, I support what Diamond chooses. I can't really talk about his relationships but for me, I will be walking down the aisle this December." But are they going to sign any Kenyan artiste to WCB? "I don't want to hide anything but for now, no, because we still have artistes that are yet to be unveiled. After that, we can sit and think about signing artistes from here."
