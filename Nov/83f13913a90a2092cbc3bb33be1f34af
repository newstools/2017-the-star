Migori Law Society of Kenya members will help prosecute police officers accused of brutality during residents’ election protests. Speaking to the press in Migori town on Tuesday, LSK members led by Odhiambo Kanyangi said they will work with human rights agencies to collect evidence and represent the residents. “We witnessed atrocities across the county like never seen before and as members of the South West branch of LSK, we will help in compensation and prosecution,” Kanyangi said. He said the demonstrations were held in the runup to the October 26 presidential election, which was boycotted in the county. “Victims suffered gunshot wounds, women were raped and children were victims of stray bullets. Property was looted by police while bystanders were bullied and intimidated,” Kanyangi said. He said among those hurt included Muslims who were assaulted as teargas canisters lobbed into mosques. The lawyers said they have been contacted by the Independent Policing Oversight Authority and other agencies, including the Kenya Human Rights and Equality Commission. They will work with victims at Oruba Nursing Home and St Joseph Mission and Migori Level Four hospitals. “We have been contacted by these agencies to gather evidence and represent victims,” Kanyangi said. LSK member Mwita Kerario said police training dictates that during demonstrations they should repel and round up unruly protesters to be taken to court. He said, instead, not a single demonstrator was charged. “The conclusion is that police were out to kill and injure the people of Migori. We will not only condemn this but ensure individual officers who broke the law are charged,” Kerario said.
