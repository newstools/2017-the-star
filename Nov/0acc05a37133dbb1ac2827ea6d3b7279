Nairobi residents should brace for more rains in the morning, says latest forecast from the Meteorological Department.
 According to the seven-day forecast released yesterday, there will
be morning rains and afternoon showers over few places in Nairobi,
Nyandarua, Nyeri, Kirinyaga, Murang'a, Kiambu, Meru, Embu, and
Tharaka Nithi counties. There will be sunny intervals in the morning in the North Rift counties of Trans Nzoia, Uasin
Gishu, Baringo and Elgeyo Marakwet. Agriculture CS Willy Bett last week said
farmers have been unable to harvest maize due to heavy rains
being experienced in the North Rift bread basket. This has caused the maize to rot in the farms. Peter Ambenje, the director of Meteorological Department, in a statement said Siaya, Kisumu, Homa Bay, Migori, Kisii, Nyamira, Trans Nzoia, Baringo,
Uasin Gishu, Elgeyo Marakwet and Nandi counties are expected to experience sunny intervals in the morning and
afternoon showers and thunderstorms over few places.
 The other counties are Laikipia, Nakuru, Narok,
Kajiado, Kericho, Bomet, Kakamega, Vihiga, Bungoma and Busia. “But there will be relatively heavier rainfall in Kisii,
Nyamira, Homa Bay, Migori, Kericho, Bomet, Narok and Kajiado counties
for the better part of the week,” he said. Kitui, Makueni, Machakos and Taita Taveta counties are expected to have sunny intervals in the morning and afternoon showers until Saturday.  The Coastal strip of Mombasa, Tana River, Kilifi,
Lamu and Kwale counties are expected to experience late morning
showers, extending into early afternoon.
 “Turkana, West Pokot and Samburu counties are expected to experience
sunny intervals the whole day, with morning rains expected at the
weekend. Northeastern counties of Marsabit, Mandera,
Wajir, Garissa and Isiolo are expected to experience sunny intervals
the whole day, but Garissa may have morning rains at the weekend,”
he said.
