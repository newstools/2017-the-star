An intern at Eldoret's Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital was found murdered in his house at Elgon View estate on Monday. The body of Mbugua Waithaka, who had been missing since Friday, was found by colleagues who went to look for him. The search party found Waithaka's house that had been broken into but that nothing had been stolen. The clinical worker lived alone in the rented house. Eldoret South OCPD Wilson Abduba said they found a huge stone they believe was used to kill the intern. He said they launched a manhunt for the killers to establish their motive. MTRH CEO Wilson Aruasa said the hospital got concerned when the intern did not turn up for work on Saturday. Aruasa said it was after he failed toÂ report on Monday that he dispatched his colleagues to find out what the problem was. "He was a very humble and dedicated doctor. We regret his killing." Police dusted the scene for fingerprints and took the body to the hospital's mortuary. Aruasa asked police to speed up investigations and ensure the killers are punished.
