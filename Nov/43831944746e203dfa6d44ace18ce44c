Deputy President William Ruto has accused the opposition of attempting to use unconstitutional means to push for political change. This is in light of NASA’s launch of the National Resistance Movement, whose aim is to pile pressure on the government until a “legitimate” presidency is restored.  Civil disobedience and the boycott of products and services from companies associated with the government and its cronies are among NASA’s arsenal.  The coalition insists it is using constitutionally sanctioned means to advance its agenda, but Ruto does not think so. “Those who campaigned against the old Constitution have started campaigning against the new one again. So, is the law the problem or are they?” Ruto tweeted on Friday. Prior to the 2010 referendum, Ruto was in the ‘No’ camp that opposed the current Constitution. NASA leader Raila Odinga was in charge of the ‘Yes’ camp that carried the day with 67 per cent of the vote. The opposition chief, however, appears to have embarked on a mission to violate certain tenets of the supreme law that he so vehemently vouched for seven years ago. This became apparent particularly after the bungled August 8 polls, when Raila started making demands not expressly provided for in the Constitution. These include calls for the dismissal of IEBC commissioners and the postponement of the repeat election beyond the constitutionally stipulated time frame of 60 days. Ruto and the entire Jubilee brigade, including President Uhuru Kenyatta, have criticised Raila for this. Ruto said Raila is rooting for constitutional change using ‘clandestine and illegal’ means. He tweeted: “If you cannot respect the Constitution that exists, then don’t waste your time making a new one. It will suffer the same fate.”
