The Kenya Ports Authority has denied hiring workers and
asked the public to be wary of conmen. In a notice published by The Star newspaper,
KPA said crooked people have, in the past two weeks, run adverts announcing job
vacancies at the port. Principal cooperate communication officer Haji Masemo
said people who are desperate fell victim. "This is the second time this year that dishonest people
are buying space in newspapers to advertise non-existent jobs," he said. "Last year, classifieds were run and people were asked
to give Sh2,000 for each job. Many paid. We traced the source but police failed
to make arrests." Masemo said a fake Facebook address bearing the name of KPA
managing director Catherine Muturi has been used to hoodwink the gullible. "We are not alone. Kenya Railways and Ken Sacco have also
suffered the same fate," Masemo said on phone on Saturday. KPA's Saturday notice, titled 'Employment Scam', said its recruitment
policy includes publishing vacancies in mainstream media and on its website. "Thereafter, formal communication on interviews for
shortlisted applicants is undertaken," the genuine advert stated, adding its
policy disallows salary projection as part of vacancy announcements. KPA said it does not intend to recruit cleaners, guards,
engineers, receptionist, mechanics, accountants, drivers, secretaries and stewards
as indicated in the fake adverts. Related: KPA hiring biased, natives suffer as outsiders picked, say clerics Click here for the latest political news Â
