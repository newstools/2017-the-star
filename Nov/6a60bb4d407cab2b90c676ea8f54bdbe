An agricultural officer from Murang’a county has started a programme to educate farmers on family planning. Maragua subcounty agricultural officer John Waihenya has issued
over 252,000 condoms to farmers this year to help prevent the spread of HIV and
help them to better plan their families. He said he started the programme when he realised
that many farmers do not buy condoms due to financial
constraints and lack of information on their benefits. Speaking to the Star on Tuesday in his office in
Kenol town, Waihenya said the programme targets farmers in Maragua, Kandara,
Kigumo and Gatanga. “Many farmers who would never buy the condoms in
pharmacies are able to get them for free and engage in safe sex,” he said. The condoms are provided by the Ministry
of Health and distributed with the help of the Red Cross Society.
