Schools in banditry-prone areas of the Kerio Valley defied violence and FGM threats to post impressive KCPE exam results. Marakwet East education officials attributed the good results to intensified patrols on the border of Elgeyo Marakwet and Baringo counties. Women and girls on Sunday said they are living in fear of being forcibly circumcised since schools closed in October. Two KCPE exam centres in Kerio Valley were relocated a day before the exam due to fears of violence.  They are Kombases and Chesetan primary schools. They were relocated to schools on the escarpment. Kombases Primary School candidates sat their exam at Kilangata Primary School.  Those from Chesetan were moved to temporary classrooms. Marakwet East education director Kimutai Chirchir yesterday said, “Schools inKerio Valley performed very well despite challenges. We worked closely with police to ensure security was beefed up.”  Toroko Primary School produced the best candidate in Marakwet East. Brian Kiptoo, 14, scored 415 marks. His school is in a banditry hot spot.
