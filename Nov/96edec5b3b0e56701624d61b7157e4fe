Kwale Jubilee supporters have termed NASA’s parallel plan of swearing-in of Raila Odinga as president incitement. Speaking on Wednesday at Ukunda, former Kwale Woman Representative Zainab Chidzuga said the party is mobilising followers to cause violence. “It’s unconstitutional to swear in two people as President. NASA has lost the numbers and now they are looking for ways to remain relevant,” she said. Chidzuga said the National Resistance Movement has no future. She urged Kwale people to rally behind President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto.  ”Since independence Kwale has had bad roads, e but under President Kenyatta’s leadership the Likoni Lunga Lunga Road will be rehabilitated and Kwale will have a port, among other projects,” she said. “The NASA leadership has nothing to offer. They are misleading their supporters by asking them to boycott almost everything,” she added. Chidzuga urged NASA to respect the Supreme Court ruling that validated Uhuru’s win in the presidential rerun on October 26. He will be sworn in on Tuesday. NASA plans to swear in Raila on the same day.
