Ipoa has put police on the spot for the killing of baby Samantha Pendo and minor Stephanie Moraa following the August 8 post-election demonstrations. The Independent Policing Oversight Authority has forwarded the file and that of 11 others who died during the period to Director of Public Prosecutions Keriako Tobiko for action. Pendo and Moraa were killed during the aftermath of the August 8 General Election as police quelled post-election protests. Six-month-old Pendo sustained fatal injuries following an alleged assault by police officers in her parents’ house in Nyalenda, Kisumu county, on August 15. Baby Pendo suffered severe head injuries, including a cracked skull and gaping fractures. A postmortem established she died of internal bleeding. Nine-year-old Moraa was shot dead allegedly by police on a third floor balcony of a three-storey building in Mathare Area 2 on August 12. An autopsy revealed the standard four pupil was shot with a high-calibre bullet, probably shot from an AK-47 or G3 rifle. The bullet tore through the chest and exited at the back, near the heart, according to the autopsy report. Ipoa has also forwarded its findings on the brutality meted out on University of Nairobi students to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. “Ipoa finalised investigations and compiled a report on the findings,” CEO Joel Mabonga said in a statement. The UoN students were assaulted within the university premises on Lower State House Road on September 28. Mabonga said Ipoa has also submitted its report to the National Police Service Commission for disciplinary action against the responsible commanders. The officers in-charge of anti-riot platoons are personally held accountable for omissions of the officers under their charge if they allow them to commit crimes during an operation. Anti-riot officers were captured on camera assaulting the students in their halls of residence after they protested against the arrest of Embakasi East MP Babu Owino.
