The Kenya Maritime office in Lamu has warned coxswains and boat operators against flouting rules during the cultural festival. Addressing Lamu coxswains yesterday, KMA inspector Alexander Munga told the coxswains to stick to the rules of the game, despite the high number of people who will be needing their services. This year’s 17th edition of the cultural festival starts today. It will take place in Lamu old town. There will be a lot of movement in and out of the island. Among those expected to reap the most benefit from the four-day fete are boat owners and operators who will have to ferry people. Munga said it is dangerous for coxswains and other boat operators to get too excited when there is such an event on the island. Many end up overloading and speeding. Munga warned that maritime police will be on the lookout during the festival. Those found violating maritime regulations will not only be arrested and charged, but they will also have their licenses confiscated and permanently revoked. “We shall not hesitate to arrest you and confiscate your vessel forever,” he said.
