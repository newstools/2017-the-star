Trans Nzoia Deputy Governor Stanley Tarus yesterday said lazy county officers will be sacked.  He said some of the officers have been reporting late for work, hurting operations at their offices. “We will not allow laziness and laxity among our staff, especially in departments which are critical like revenue and finance. Those who think they can do anything they want are mistaken. We shall sack them and give that opportunity to people who are serious,” Tarus said.  He spoke after an impromptu visit at the finance and revenue offices. To his surprise, less than one per cent of the officers had reported to work by 9am.  Tarus said the county collected Sh300 million in the last financial year, a figure he said raises more questions than answers.  “We want to know why we are not collecting enough revenue. Trans Nzoia should be collecting more than Sh500 million annually. That should be our target this financial year and that’s the reason we want our officers to work extra hard,” he said. Tarus also said the county will privatise and automate revenue collection. He said the car parking system has been automated. This has helped push revenue collection by 15 per cent, Tarus said.  Currently, JamboPay is conducting a pilot project on revenue collection. Tarus said the county has been losing millions of shillings through employees who fail to remit collected revenue.
