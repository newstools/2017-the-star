Only 37 per
cent of Marsabit residents use toilets, putting them at risk of contracting
diseases, health authorities have said. Marsabit
deputy county director Hassan Halakhe said the failure by 63 per cent locals to
use bushes instead of toilets is worrying and may lead to spread of waterborne
diseases. Halakhe said
the locals risk contracting Cholera, typhoid and ailments caused by poor hygiene. He told locals
at Funan Qumbi in Moyale during the World Toilet Day on Sunday to construct pit
latrines to avoid imminent disease outbreak. “We are
asking you to join hands and dig pit latrines. It is shameful that we are defecating
in bushes and areas near rivers,” Halakhe said. North Horr Public
Health officer Denge Kuro said poor hygiene has exacerbated the poverty levels
in most areas of Marsabit. Kuro said residents
have been left treating themselves after contracting poor hygiene related
diseases.  He said locals
are fetching unclean water from rivers where animals also drink from, but Kuro
urged the residents to treat the water. He said
water treatment chemicals area available at no costs at the County’s health
facilities. At least 4.5
billion in the world have not toilets in their homes, with 862 million out of
the 4.5 billion using defecating in the bushes, according to the United Nations. Another 1.8
billion people globally, according to the UN, use unclean water from rivers in
areas where majority of locals do not use toilets. Kuro said
the poor hygiene problems in the area have been compounded pastoralism that
cause herders who often migrate in search of pasture for their livestock not
construct toilets.
