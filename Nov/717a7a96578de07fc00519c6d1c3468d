Criminals in Ol Kalou will soon be left at the mercy of residents, Nyandarua Central OCPD Wilson Kosgei said on Saturday. He spoke at Ol Kalou police station after two notorious criminals - Samuel Wanjira and Peter Muturi - were arrested. The gang terrorised residents in Huruma, Jerusalem, Site and Jua Kali estates . Wanjira is a jailbird. “And this boy should be marked very well. If he becomes difficult for us to handle, we shall leave residents to deal with him. We have taken him to prison, but he terrorises residents when he is released,” Kosgei said. Wanjira left prison two months ago. He engaged in crime and fled to Narok then Kiambu.
