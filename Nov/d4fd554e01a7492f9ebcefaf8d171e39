Why should Kenyan youths be dragged to hell by the Supreme Court ruling yet they are already suffering unemployment? Former CJ Willy Mutunga has asked. Mutunga wrote this on Sunday in response to a Twitter follower's message that the court's decision would not matter to the people. The tweet he replied followed followed murders at Riverside in Ruaraka, Nairobi. Twitter user '@Owaahh' said the weekend's events showed Monday's decision wouldn't matter. "This weekend has shown that it doesn't really matter what SCOK decides tomorrow, because one side has to lose for the other to win." "...and they will drag us to hell with them. Or rather instead of them...," '@Owaahh' said.

The six-judge bench led by Chief Justice David Maraga held that the petitions filed over the poll lacked merit. The cases were by former Kilome MP Harun Mwau, International Commission of Jurists Kenya chapter chairman Njonjo Mue and MUHURI boss Khelef Khalifa.

"This is the burning question for the Kenyan youth: Why should you be dragged to another hell when you are already in the hell of unemployment, poverty, lack of quality education, health, housing etc...all cutting across your ethnic, religious and regional divide?" he asked. The conversation elicited mixed reactions with many users blaming the ex-CJ about the decision he made granting Uhuru a win in the 2013 election.
