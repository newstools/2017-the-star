Odhiambo was testifying in petition challenging his victory yesterday. “According to Midiwo’s own tally, l garnered 34,583 votes and he followed a distance second with 29,703 votes,” Odhiambo said. Odhiambo laughed off claims that Midiwo’s victory in the August 8 General Election was stolen, saying numbers don’t lie. Earlier, Midiwo had claimed the poll was marred by violence. Allegations that Odhiambo dismissed, saying his campaign nickname was “Akuba”, which means a big one unlike Midiwo’s nickname “Otada” that means violence. “By these names, who was to use violence?” Asked Odhiambo. Midiwo further claimed Odhiambo bribed voters on Election Day. He denied the allegation vehemently, terming it malicious.
