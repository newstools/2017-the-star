Samsung Electronics has kicked off its Ethanol Stove Project to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in Kenya by 500,000 tonnes over the next five to seven years. The electronics manufacturer has subsided 10,000 ethanol stoves, called Safi Cookers, to be sold to households across Mombasa County at Sh1,995 down from Sh4,000 per stove. The project which promotes clean, renewable energy aims to reduce the demand for charcoal countrywide starting with the Coast region. “Creating a stronger, healthier planet for future generations has always been an important focus for Samsung,” says Patricia King’ori, head of corporate marketing at Samsung Electronics East Africa. About 80 per cent of Kenyans living in urban areas use charcoal for cooking thereby creating huge demand for the commodity. In 2015 it was estimated that Kenya was losing a shocking 5.6 million trees daily. And the effects of deforestation have been significant, leading to reduced rainfall and increased soil erosion, in turn causing food scarcities and other increasing difficulties for people living in the area. King’ori said carbon emissions is a crisis affecting the whole of Africa with the Green Africa Foundation revealing that the rate of annual deforestation exceeds the global annual average of 0.8 per cent. “Additionally Samsung last year launched a project to plant over 20,000 trees in Nairobi’s Karura forest to boost Nairobi ‘s forest cover. We believe our green energy initiative including Ethanol Stove Project will play a significant role in improving the country’s green energy for future generations,” she said.
