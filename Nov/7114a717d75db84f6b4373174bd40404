The five Kenyan sailors detained in Jarkata, Indonesia, over illegal entry have camped at the Kenyan consulate. They want the government to intervene and secure their release, the Star has learnt. Their ship developed mechanical problems in Malaysia in August 2016. The sailors include Captain Mzee Khamis, Mapinga Mwalimu (bosun), Yusuf Omar (greaser), Tela Juma (cook) and Aggrey Diedi (electrician). They spent the night in the consulate compound. “They went to the consulate yesterday (Monday). The Kenyan authorities have assured them of help, but they will hear none of it,” Andrew Mwangura, the Mombasa Port CSOs Platform chairman (pictured), said on phone yesterday. International Transport Workers Federation inspector in charge of East Africa Betty Makena yesterday said Indonesian authorities have given them up to November 2 to resolve the matter.
