Vihiga United yesterday enhanced their chances of promotion to the SportPesa Premier League after a narrow 1-0 win over hosts Palos at Moi Stadium in Kisumu. The league’s top scorer Patrick Okullo scored a 67th minute penalty to give the visitors a deserved win which condemned Palos to a fourth consecutive loss in the National Super League. Centre referee pointed to the spot after Kevin Monyi was adjudged to have brought down veteran midfielder Charles Okwemba amid protests from Palos players. All the same, Okullo slotted it past David Oputi in the Palos’ goal. Five minutes later, Alex Waiswa blasted over the bar with only Barnabas Tiema to beat as Palos started to enjoy possession. Following the win, Vihiga moved to second position on 74 points, same as Wazito but with a superior goal difference. Leaders Ushuru are on 75 points and third placed KCB have 73 points. Vihiga were the better side in the match with their players Amos Kigadi, Jacob Atinda and Dennis Wafula dominating proceedings and raiding the Palos goal at will. Palos defence marshaled by Victor Manuel and goalkeeper Oputi, however, kept out all their threats in the first half. Okullo and Okwemba pulled strings in the midfield, limiting Palos to their half for the better part of first half but their strikers spurned several scoring chances. Okullo then wasted a clear chance that attracted the ire coach Edward Manoah while Okwemba effort went over the bar in the 40th minute as the promotion favourites grew impatient. Vihiga visit Bidco in Thika on Sunday with Palos travelling to Nairobi to battle relegation-threatened Administration Police. Manoah blamed his strikers for failing to kill off the game early. “My players were shy in front of goal. I’m however contended with the win. It was a tough game with high stakes,” he said.
