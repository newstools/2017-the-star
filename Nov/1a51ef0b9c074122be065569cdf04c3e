Some 100,781 students sat the KCPE exams as Nyanza recorded an increase in the number of candidates. The figure reflects an increase of 9,303 candidates. Regional Education coordinator Richard Chepkawai said the exams started smoothly. The exams are being conducted in 44 subcounties within the six counties. He attributed the increase in the number of candidates to the reduced fees and waiver of exam fees. “Payment of examination fee was a big factor in the county and the action taken by the government has seen an increase in enrollment,” Chepkawai said. He added that in previous years, some candidates dropped out because they could not raise the registration fees. Speaking to the Star on the phone, Chepkawai said so far no irregularities have been reported.
