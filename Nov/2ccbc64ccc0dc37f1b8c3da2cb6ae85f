Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong has vowed to act on pharmacists who create artificial drugs shortage in health institutions in the County by delaying to distribute them. Speaking on Thursday at the drugs store in Matayos where he made an impromptu visit,the Governor was shocked to find the drugs store filled to capacity and yet some public health institutions in the County were complaining of drugs shortage. The County Pharmacist Dr Katayi Silvano cited transport challenges in delivering the drugs to various sub counties. “Some people have failed to work. We budgeted for it and drugs are here since August and making lame excuses that there is no transport.We have over 20 pickups and Palweco gave us 10 more, so that is an excuse,” Ojaamong’ said. Ojaamong said the initial budget for drugs was Sh100m but was increased to Sh350m annually to reduce shortage in public health institutions across the county.
