A boda boda operator was Friday killed in a road accident and another shot and injured by police as their colleagues protested the fatal crash. 24-year-old Benson Muchangi was entering the Embu-Meru highway from a feeder road when he was crushed to death by a lorry. Embu East police boss Peter Muchemi said the lorry was negotiating a bend when the motorcyclist suddenly entered the road.  "The rider slipped and fell under the rear tyres of the lorry which crushed him to death," Muchemi said. Boda boda operators protested the killing of their colleague. They held a demonstration and blocked the highway before police moved in to disperse them. It was during the clash with police that another boda boda operator was shot and injured. They claimed the officer who fired the bullet was drunk. Runyenjes MP Eric Muchangi called for the sacking of the officer. Â
