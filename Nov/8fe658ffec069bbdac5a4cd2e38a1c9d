Tension is still high in Muhoroni, Kisumu county, after two people were killed following animal theft. The two were killed in Ochoro village as they trailed animals which had been stolen by rustlers on Wednesday night. Several goats were stolen but one was recovered. Kennedy Oseka, 22 and Benson Oringe, 45, were shot with arrows on their chest. Their families said the arrows were deeply rooted below the shoulder. Oringe left behind eight children. His wife, Jessica Ooko, said he had responded to a distress call from a neighbour who was raided by rustlers. Mary Oseka, Omondi’s mother, said her son succumbed to injuries at the hospital. “He was bleeidng through his mouth and nose,” Oseka said. Muhoroni police boss Mohammed Jarso asked residents to maintain peace and calm as investigations continue. He said they have launched a thorough probe into killings and promised to arrest the culprits. “Let us not take the law into our hands by revenging. I assure you justice will prevail,” Jarso said. Police have been deployed in the area. But Muhoroni residents have accused police of laxity in tackling clashes at the borders of Kisumu, Nandi and Kericho counties. Residents have asked for a speedy move by the national and county governments to set up a police post at the border of Kericho and Kisumu. They urged county governments to open up roads to ease police accessibility to the affected areas.
