The Catholic Church has warned of fraudsters collecting money from the public in Eldoret allegedly to assist in the funeral expenses for the late Bishop Cornelius Korir. Father Fredrick Njoroge from the Eldoret Diocese on Saturday said they have not authorized any such collections. He asked the public to ignore the conmen, who might have spread to others areas. “The church has not asked anyone to go round begging for money for Bishop Korir’s funeral. No one should use the name of the Bishop or the church for such illegal activities,' Father Njoroge said. He said a special fundraising will be held at the Sacred Heart Cathedral on Tuesday ahead of Korir's burial on November 11. Njoroge said friends and members of the church will give their contribution directly on that day. “We are very encouraged by the wish of many friends and other Kenyans to help the church in one way or another and we will work with the government and everyone else to give bishop Korir a good send off,” he said.
