UDP leader
Cyrus Jirongo has urged political leaders should dialogue to resolve the current political crisis. He said the
problem is purely political and can only be resolved by honest politicians. “This problem is not
legal and cannot be resolved by churches. It doesn’t matter which route one
takes, only a political solution will solve this mess. Chest-thumping will not
help matters,” Jirongo told the Star on the phone yesterday. He contested the
presidency in the August 8 general election and in the repeat presidential race on October 26, but lost.  NASA leader Raila
Odinga withdrew from the repeat contest, citing a partial electoral agency. Jirongo, a former Lugari MP,
said the Constitution is the source of the current problem since it only provides positions
for only two topmost leaders – the President and Deputy President. “It is necessary that as leader we review the Constitution to ensure all communities feel they are part of the
government of the day,” Jirongo said.  NASA last week said it will form a task force to examine areas in the supreme law that needs
to be amended to end standoffs after every five years.  Jubilee has also expressed
willingness to reexamine the Constitution to
tie loose ends. The National Council of
Churches of Kenya last week proposed constitutional amendment to expand
the executive by creating the position of a Prime Minister, two deputies and official opposition
leader positions to accommodate more leaders.  Jirongo also said there is need to expand the executive to accommodate more Kenyans for the top jobs.  “Even in America, where
we copied the pure presidential system, it worked well when only the whites
were voting and controlling power. When the civil societies worked hard to have
blacks, Latinos, Arabs, Chinese, India among others voting, the country is torn,” he said.
