The government has started to equip and expand technical institutes. Transport CS James Macharia on Thursday said the government plans to upgrade the institutions to offer quality education to students who do not make it to university. He spoke in Nyeri during a graduation ceremony at Kagumo Teachers' College Currently, there are more than 70 operational technical and vocational colleges, four of which are for trainees with special needs. Since 2014, the government has built 60 TVCs, which are complete and ready to become operational. An additional 70 TVCs are under construction and are expected to be completed by June 2017. The government plans to have a TVC in each constituency. Macharia said Moiben Diploma Teachers' Training College will be expanded to offer diploma in science education. The college will replace Kenya Science Teachers' College which was taken over by the University of Nairobi after the government's decision to close down some middle-level colleges and turn them into universities. In April, it was reported that the government had moved away from opening new universities to upgrading the quality of existing ones. On Wednesday, Education CS Fred Matiang'i banned public universities from opening more satellite campuses. He asked them to strengthen the existing ones. Macharia said upgrading colleges will help address the lack of technical personnel in the job market. Â
