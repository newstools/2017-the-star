Kenya Ports Authority managing director Catherine Mturi has said the construction of the second phase of the second container terminal will begin “early next year”. KPA had earlier announced the construction of the second phase was scheduled for January. The terminal will create space for an extra 450,000 containers. The first phase can accommodate 550,000 containers. It cost Sh30 billion and was commissioned by President Uhuru Kenyatta in September last year. Uhuru said ports are poised to play a more integral role in trade facilitation following the discovery of oil and gas in the country and in the region. “Kenya itself discovered oil in Turkana and intends to export its first shipment in June,” Uhuru said, adding that his administration is improving the oil-handling capacity at the Port of Mombasa. KPA has secured a Sh3 billion loan from the Japan International Cooperation Agency for the second phase. “In our effort to position the port as a world class port, we have continued to improve infrastructure and modernised services. Part of this improvement includes operationalisation of a second container terminal,” Mturi said. She spoke on Saturday night at Nyali Golf Club during the KPA corporate golf tournament dinner. Though many businesses recorded low trade because of the stretched political period, Mturi said KPA has done remarkably well. “It has been one intensive year with two elections. We cannot divorce business from politics,” she said. The port in 2016 handled 27.36 million tonnes of cargo, compared to 26.73 million in 2015, marking a growth of 2.4 per cent. “On container traffic, a growth rate of 1.4 per cent registering 1.9 million TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent unit containers) in 2016, from 1.7 million TEUs in 2015 was witnessed,” she said. From January to September this year, Mturi said the port got 22.7 million tonnes of cargo, up from 20.5 million tonnes last year. “This is a 10.6 per cent growth,” she said. Container traffic increased by about 83,000 TEUs - a 10.4 per cent improvement - to 887,412 TEUs from 804,036 in 2015 and 2016 respectively. “Transshipment traffic, a business which we are trying to grow, has increased from 392,000 tonnes in January-September to 622,000 tonnes this year,” the MD said. KPA will focus on transshipment for rigorous growth. “In the transit segment, the port had 6.49 million tonnes between January-September this year compared to 5.98 million tonnes last year. This is an 8.5 per cent improvement,” Mturi said. The MD confirmed plans to build a bigger and modern oil terminal are at an advanced stage.
