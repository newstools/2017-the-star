Gem MP Elisha Odhiambo has said it is time for a revolution and alleged that the government is only "geared to kill and retain power". He condemned police assault on NASA supporters on Friday and likened the situation as a trigger for revolution in Libya and Egypt. Three people were shot dead as police engaged in a seven-hour battle with the protesters as they welcomed NASA leader Raila Odinga back in the country. Police claimed five people were stoned to death by mobs as they looted property during the protests. A Reuters photographer reported that two people were killed as police dispersed protesters in much of the city.

He said such treatment of NASA leaders is what has made them opt for the People's Assembly. The MP warned that the assembly will give people a president they want if the Jubilee administration does not observe the law. "How do you kill five innocent citizens for exercising their constitutional rights?" he said. Odhiambo said police should protect the lives and property of citizens rather than "resort to the influence of an illegitimate government".
