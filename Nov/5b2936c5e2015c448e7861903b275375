NASA is threatening to extend its boycott against Kenyan companies that it believes helped rig the August 8 election. Safaricom is targeted because it allegedly transmitted fake results. But Airtel and Telkom also failed to transmit Form 34As in time and NASA has not targeted them. Brookside is targeted because it belongs to the Kenyatta family. But would it then be legitimate for Jubilee to organise a boycott of gas cylinders produced by Spectre which is owned by the Odingas. And Bidco is on the list because it allegedly contributed funds to the Jubilee election campaign. But many other companies also contributed, and to Raila as well as Uhuru! Ordinary Kenyans will pay the price for this boycott. Who will buy western farmers' milk if not Brookside? What will happen if Bidco has to lay off workers? NASA has not provided any evidence that these companies have done anything wrong. Now more companies may soon suffer the same fate.  This misguided boycott is not the right way to fight for democracy in Kenya.   Quote of the day: "A person is a fool to become a writer.
