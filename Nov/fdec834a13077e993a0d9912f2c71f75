Residents blocked the Molo-Olenguruone road for almost two hours yesterday morning, after a body of a boda boda rider from Kuresoi, Nakuru, was found butchered and dumped in a forest near Isinya rose farm. Security guard David Kirui found the body at 6.30am, when he was going round the farm and raised the alarm that attracted hundreds of people. The crowd demanded action. Police arrived an hour later. “I was looking for firewood to light a fire when I noticed a body in a reflector jacket,” Kirui said. The rider, identified as Leonard, is believed to have been killed by people who pretended to be customers. He had bought the motorcycle a few weeks ago. The body had wounds. “We have found a battleground with blood all over and a helmet and sharp knife broken into pieces a few metres from the body” a police officer said.
