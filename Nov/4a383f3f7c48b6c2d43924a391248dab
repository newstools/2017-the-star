A court has granted the Anti-Terror Police Unit five days to hold an Eritrean national they say is a key figure behind a human trafficking network in Kenya and abroad. Gebremeskel Kahssay Bahta was arrested at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport on Sunday. The suspect has been on terror watch list since 2011. Court documents show he was deported in 2005 after he was found to be in Kenya illegally. He tried to block his deportation by suing the Attorney General and the Immigration ministry, but his application was rejected by High Court judge Roselyn Wendo on March 14, 2007. Yesterday, the ATPU told the court Bahta arrived in Kenya from the United Arab Emirates and was about to travel to South Africa, when he was nabbed. According to an affidavit by Sergeant Esther Chao he had bought a ticket and checked in for a flight using an Eritrean passport. Further, the officer said the suspectâ€™s phones were being analysed at their forensic laboratory for purposes of identifying his associates.
