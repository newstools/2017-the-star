Kenya risks witnessing attacks akin to Egypt's without peaceful inter and intra-faith co-existence, Supkem has warned. The Supreme Council of Kenya Muslims also said unmanageable political differences can results in fatal feuds as witnessed in the past. Supkem, which promised to offer "the lacking leadership in politically-charged Kenya", said differences, "some trivial", caused the deaths in Egypt because they were poorly handled. The council’s statement came as the Egyptian military kicked off a hunt for the attackers of a Sufi mosque in the northern Sinai. The assault - thought to be deadliest in country’s history - left 235 worshipers dead. President Uhuru Kenyatta condoled with Egyptians whose President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi vowed to respond to the assault with "brute force."

"In the case of Egypt, it is Muslims against Muslims and the fight is due to minor differences," he said. No terror group has claimed responsibility for the attack that has the hallmarks of an ISIS operation. Nzibo said the council will focus on peace and nation-building because "we don't want to be refugees". Chaos that broke up after previous general elections or ethnic clashes left many internally displaced. "Elections are now behind us. We are learning from our own history. We should work together and speak in one voice for the sake of peace and stability," the chairman said. Former Supkem boss Abdulghafur el-Busaid said the council is ready to mediate between NASA and Jubilee. Busaid said the council will remain apolitical and neutral. "We shall offer good and quality leadership," he said, when he and Nzibo spoke opened Supkem's Coast office in Mombasa on Saturday.
