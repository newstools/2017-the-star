Kenya Under 20 women’s team were eliminated from the race for a 2018 World Cup slot after suffering a humiliating 5-1 defeat to Ghana in the return leg match of the second round at the Kenyatta Stadium, Machakos yesterday. The Starlets who were hammered 5-0 in the first leg in Ghana bowed out on a 10-1 aggregate score. Ghana stunned Starlets with a first minute goal through Akokye Olivia before Adubea Princella added the second in the 8th minute. Princella was on target again in first half injury time for a 3-0 at half time lead. Ghana made it 4-0 in the 75th minute through Grace Acheampong before Princella completed her hat-trick in the 87th minute. Rachel Mwenda was Kenya’s scorer. Starlets’ coach Caroline Ajowi said: “We conceded very silly goals especially in the first half. We shall go back to the drawing board and rectify our mistakes for the next round of assignments. We shall also scout for many players to bolster the team,” she said. Ghana’s coach Yusuf Basigi said they have now shifted their focus on eliminating Cameroon in the third round in January next year. “Our opponents has a future. They played a good game but lady-luck failed to smile on them. I know we have qualified for previous world cups but we have not gone past the group stage, thus our desire to break that jinx next year,” he said. Football Kenya Federation Vice President Doris Petra said Kenya said Kenya missed seven key players who are sitting for their KCSE exams. “Losing a match is normal. Ghana have been to World Cup over three times,” she said.
