An AFP photographer arrested for trespassing into Brookside Dairy's farm in Kiambu county did not take plea for the second time on Wednesday. Chief photographer Yasuyoshi Chiba was arrested at the weekend for going to private land without permission. He did not plead to the charge as the prosecution counsel did not go to court. Chiba's lawyer Haron Ndubi wanted to make submissions on the charges being extreme but senior principal magistrate Stella Atambo said there was no quorum. "I tried locating the prosecuting counsel but I could not get a hold of him. The court has no quorum...my hands are tied," Atambo said. She deferred the plea-taking to Thursday. The magistrate granted Ndubi's request for police to submit the photographer's passport to the court Atambo also granted the lawyer's plea for the Sh10,000 police bail to remain until Chiba takes plea.
