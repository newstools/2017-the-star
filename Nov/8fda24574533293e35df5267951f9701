Outgoing Knut chairman Mudzo Nzili has dismissed reports he was coerced into relinquishing his position at the giant teachers’ union. The Knut constitution says any official, who attains the age of 60 must retire. It had emerged Nzili had refused to take terminal leave until an agreement was reached that his name be retained in the registrar of the Registrar of Trade Unions for the next seven months. “I didn’t refuse to go for retirement, but resisted being replaced during the by-election in December. Through wise counsel of the National Executive Council, we have reached an agreement that an election will be held in June 2018,” Nzili said on Thursday at Severin Hotel, Mombasa. Knut has settled on Wycliffe Omuchenyi as the acting national chair. Ndzili and first vice chairperson Samson Mwangi will be 60 next year. Secretary general Wilson Sossion said Nzili will proceed on terminal leave immediately and Omuchenyi will take over in acting capacity until June 2018. “The officers to retire, shall remain in the register of the Registrar of Trade Unions until a by-election in June 2018,” he said.
