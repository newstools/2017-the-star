A family in Kuresoi is living in fear after a group of armed youths accompanied by police officers attempted to evict them from their home. Grace Ngeno, a widow, said police arrested her son as the gangsters started clearing bushes in their five-acre plot. She accused the area chief David Busienei of selling the land to a rich man. "We have been living here since 1997. I am worried that the stranger, who has the support of local chief and APs, want to evict me." Ngeno on Friday said the chief is fond of hiring youths to assault the poor in the community. "Our chief has tortured us for many years. He sells poor people's parcels of land to the rich and hires youths to beat the owners," she said. Her son Gilbert Koske was detained at Kapkembu Administration Police post before being taken to the DCI office in Olenguruone. An AP officer at post said they only offered security to the owner of the land adding that they arrested Koske for trespassing into another person's land. Chief Busienei distanced himself from the allegations saying that though Ngeno has been living in the land for many years, it belongs to somebody else. "I am not aware of the incident but I just know that the land does not belong to the occupant." Â
