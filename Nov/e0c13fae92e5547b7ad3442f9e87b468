Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho and
his Kilifi counterpart Amason Kingi have been told to resign if they want to push for a breakaway of the Coast from the rest of Kenya. Jubilee politician Abdulsalaam Kassim said the two should relinquish their positions. “You cannot say you want to
secede when you are still enjoying the trappings of power brought to you by
the same country you no longer want to be part of,” Kassim said. He spoke to the Star in an
interview in Mombasa on Wednesday afternoon.
