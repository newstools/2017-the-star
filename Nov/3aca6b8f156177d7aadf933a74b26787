The much-needed rains will get heavier at the weekend, after pupils complete their KCPE exam, the weatherman has said. Clouds will thicken toward the weekend and rains will follow. Farmers have planted food crops for the short-rains season. The rains would, however, be disruptive if they hit hard before the KCPE exam ends tomorrow. In the past, exam papers were flown to schools after roads became impassable. Head of meteorological services Peter Ambenje yesterday said a few parts of Western Kenya are already receiving heavy afternoon rains. The rains will increase to more places from Saturday to Monday. Drought-stricken areas may recover. Turkana, West Pokot and Samburu will experience sunny intervals in the day until Saturday. In Central Kenya, which includes Nairobi, Embu, Nyeri and Tharaka Nithi counties among others, cloudy mornings will give way to sunny intervals until Saturday. Marsabit, Mandera, Wajir, Garissa and Isiolo will have enhaced rains on Monday next week, while Ukambani will have sunny intervals in the morning and afternoon showers over few places until Monday. Coast is expected to experience enhanced morning and afternoon showers over several places.
