Tatu City Power Company has applied for a licence to generate, distribute and supply electricity to the Electricity Regulatory Commission. In a gazette notice, the company said it will formally make the application on November 20 should no individual or organisation oppose it. "The grant of the licence will not have adverse effects on any public or local authorities, companies, persons or bodies of persons within the areas of undertaking," the notice read. The company operates a 5000-acre mixed-use development in Kiambu county. It has schools, offices, shopping centers, nature areas, medical centers and entertainment facilities. These have attracted scores of industrial entities to a 425-acre industrial park special economic zone.  Last year, the company appointed US-based Power Engineers to consult on development of electricity for use within the Sh240 billion industrial complex. It noted in a statement that Power Engineers is one of the largest consulting engineering firms in the United States.
