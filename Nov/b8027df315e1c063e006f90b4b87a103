The Assumption of Office Committee preparing for the swearing in of Uhuru Kenyatta as President has again embarked on its work less than a week after Uhuru was declared winner of the repeat poll. Just after Uhuru was declared the winner of the August 8 general election, the committee chaired by Secretary to the Cabinet Joseph Kinyua had almost finished the preparation. It was forced to shelve the plans when the Supreme Court nullified Uhuru’s victory. A source in the Office of the President yesterday told the Star the committee has picked up from where it left when the petition was filed at the Supreme Court. “So far no petition has been filed in the Supreme Court, which has prompted the committee to proceed with the preparations. The committee is working on the logistical plans and the guests to be invited,” the official said. The apex court ordered fresh election conducted within the Constitutional 60-day timeline. On Thursday last week, the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission conducted the repeat poll in which Uhuru emerged winner. If there will be no petition filed at the Supreme Court within seven days challenging Uhuru’s Monday win, he will be sworn in on November 14. “The President-elect shall be sworn in on the first Tuesday following the fourteenth day after the declaration of the results of the presidential election,if no petition has been filed,” the law says. But in case a petition is filed and the outcome upholds the victory, then the swearing in will take place on the seventh day following the day the court rendered the decision. The Constitution also says the swearing in of the President-elect shall be in public before the Chief Justice and in his absence, the Deputy CJ.
