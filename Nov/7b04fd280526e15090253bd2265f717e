The National Gikuyu Cutural Association - Kiama kia Ma - held celebrations to mark the initiation of 175 adolescents into manhood. Speaking during the graduation at Gatundu Primary School last Friday, association chairman Kariuki Kibathi said adolescents need both parental and professional guidance as they try to navigate modern living. He said the only way to ensure teenagers do not fall into the trap of peer pressure is to teach them good morals early in life. Kibathi said this should not be left to teachers alone.  “The most important thing is for the young ones to be made to appreciate their culture and traditions since they are an integral part of their wellbeing,” he said. Kibathi said rehabilitating alcoholics and drug abusers is expensive and transformation is not guaranteed. He called on elders to teach youths cultural values and encourage them to avoid premarital sex. Kibathi urged the youth to appreciate the sacrifices made by parents to raise and educate them and avoid wayward behaviour.
