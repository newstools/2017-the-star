Sony Sugar capitalised on home advantage to maul visiting Muhoroni Youth 5-1 at Sony Sugar Green Stadium in Premier League match yesterday. This was a huge boost for Sony who are set to play new champions Gor Mahia in the final fixture of the season in this weekend. This was the third huge loss for Muhoroni in the last two weeks having lost to Kariobangi Sharks (7-2) and Bandari (6-2). The Got Alila side has soaked 19 goals in their last five matches and the change of guard at Muhoroni prior to their game against Sharks did little to save them from sinking to the second tier and preventing embarrassments. George Abege scythed home the opening goal barely 14 minutes into them match to break the deadlock before completing his brace in the 34th minute to give Sony a 2-0 lead at half time. The brace by the Ugandan forward saw him take his tally to seven goals. Sonyâ€™s Benjamin Mosha served his former employers with bitterness in the 62nd minute after rounding off Salim Sowedi to slot home the third goal. Bliss Kityo pulled one back for Muhoroni in the 68th minute. Defence lapses by Muhoroni Youth allowed Sony to score two goals within a space of two minutes as Victor Ademba and David Simiyu completed the five goal rout for Sony in the 73rd and 75th minute. The win saw Sony topple AFC Leopards from the tenth spot on goal difference as the two share a similar tally of 42 points. Muhoroni are set to complete their five year stay in SportPesa Premier League this Saturday against AFC Leopards at Mumias Sports Complex.
