Kisumu Governor Anyang Nyong’o and his Kiambu counterpart Ferdinand Waititu have been accused of making unilateral governance decisions that are against the law. Civil Society Reference Group leader Suba Churchill yesterday asked Kiambu residents to start Waititu’s impeachment for scrapping the ward administrator positions. The lobby has condemned Nyong’o for banning demonstrations in Kisumu apart from those called by NASA or ODM. The group says this is an attempt to limit people’s rights to assemble and hold peaceful processions to air their grievances. “We demand that Waititu revokes his unlawful abolition of the position of ward administrators and reinstate officials serving in the positions or face court action,” Churchill said.
