Kandara MP Alice Wahome has urged NASA MPs to join Parliament in looking for a solution to
constitutional issues. He said it is possible to provide answers to the
many problems the country is experiencing if all MPs convene in Parliament. “We need to put our heads together and decide whether
there is a serious dichotomy that makes our country ungovernable and what to do
about it,” she said. Wahome was speaking in Murang’a town on
Wednesday. She said together MPs can evaluate
the structure of democracy to see whether positions can be
created to accommodate poll losers, especially in the case of leader of
minority. “Anyone can win
today and lose tomorrow,” Wahome added. She said the majority of Kenyans are feeling the pinch
of the flailing economy and want to go back to building the nation.
