Kenya National Union of Teachers chairman Mudzo Nzili on Friday started his terminal leave ahead of his April retirement. A by-election to replace Nzili and first vice chairman Samson Kaguma has been pushed to June. It was to be held next month. No reason was given for rescheduling. Nzili said the contentious issue of retirement and when to hold elections had been dealt with conclusively. “Upon attaining age 60, one shall cease to hold office. My deputy and I shall attain the mandatory age of 60 in 2018. The bone of contention we have resolved was for us to be effectively replaced,” he said. According to secretary general Wilson Sossion, Nzili and Kaguma will attend the Annual Delegates Conference next month, where they will give their farewell message to teachers. “Between now and June, we shall be dealing with the transitional issues so that we can now and in future handle retirements and transitions in a decent and more organised manner,” he said. Wycliffe Omucheyi has been appointed acting chairman.  “These are issues that my colleagues, being led by Sossion, have been able to deliver. As a union, we will follow the Constitution when dealing with them,” Nzili said. The Labour ministry had initially warned Knut against holding a by-elections to replace Nzili, saying he has not reached retirement age. A statement from the ministry said it would be unlawful to proceed with the by-election on December 14, since no positions are vacant. The ministry has received letters from Nzili and Kaguma, who both said they have not attained the mandatory retirement age.
