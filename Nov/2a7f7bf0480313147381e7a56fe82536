ACK Archbishop Jackson Ole Sapit has warned of chaos similar to the post-election violence of 2007/08 if politicians do not sober up. Addressing the press at the ACK St Peter’s Cathedral in Garissa yesterday, Sapit said the current political standoff can easily turn to violence. He said Kenyans are suffering as Jubilee and NASA engage in political supremacy battles. “It is high time President Uhuru Kenyatta and NASA leader Raila Odinga initiate serious talks that will save our country from degenerating into total anarchy. No Kenyan would wish to experience what happened in 2007/08. We should not be very forgetful,” Sapit said.  Five people were killed on Friday after police clashed with Raila supporters, who had turned up to receive him at the airport. Looting and destruction of property were also reported. Sapit condemned the incident. He said leaders should not fight for power at the expense of people’s lives. He advised both Uhuru and Raila to integrate their manifestos and move the country forward. Sapit said religious leaders are willing to mediate talks between Uhuru and Raila.“We have been on the forefront in asking for political tolerance. When we are given a chance, we will still convey the same message - that of peace and coexistence,” Sapit said.  Sapit’s call was echoed by former Dujis MP Hussein Maalim, who regretted the direction the country is taking. “It is unfortunate that we are finding ourselves in such a situation. We risk losing our country if we are not careful,” Maalim said.
