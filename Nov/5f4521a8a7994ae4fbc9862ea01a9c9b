Engineers and consultants who fail to participate in continuous professional development risk deregistration, the Engineers Board of Kenya has said. The more than 2,000 professional and 300 consulting engineers registered with the board are now mandated to participate in continuous professional development as per the Engineers Act of 2011. Failure to adhere to the rules will result in deregistration from January 2018. EBK chief executive officer Nicholas Musuni said in a statement yesterday  Section 20 of the Engineers Act allows for the removal of someone from the register should they fail to satisfy the requirements. By compelling their seniors to supervise and mentor them, the starting group of graduate engineers will benefit and significantly grow in the profession.  The continuous professional development programme for engineers will share knowledge and experiences and influence policy directives. “It will make engineers better servants to the public and promote expectations in the code of engineers,”Musuni says. The country is still struggling with the number of qualified and registered engineers that are set to meet the demands and expectations of Vision 2030. Vision 2030 aims at making Kenya a middle income income that provides high quality life for all its citizens. Last Wednesday, engineers took part in the National Engineers Forum held at Kenya School of Monetary Studies.
