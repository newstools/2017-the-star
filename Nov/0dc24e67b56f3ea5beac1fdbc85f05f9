NASA co-principal Kalonzo Musyoka has dispelled rumours that his wife Pauline is dead. Speaking to the Star on phone on Wednesday, Kalonzo said his wife Pauline is alive but still receiving treatment. For over two years now, Pauline, who was previously admitted to Nairobi Hospital, has been undergoing treatment for an unknown ailment. Pauline works with Central Bank of Kenya as a banker and is on medical leave. Her health problems are said to have started in 2015 and she has been in and out of hospitals until she was taken to Germany for treatment. NASA principal Moses Wetang'ula and several other Opposition leaders last week visited Kalonzo in Germany. Kalonzo has been in Germany for many weeks attending to her. Wetang'ula was with Turkana Governor Josphat Nanok and Makueni's Kivutha Kibwana. They took a picture at an unidentified hospital. More on this: Wetang'ula visits Kalonzo in Germany, Raila expected
