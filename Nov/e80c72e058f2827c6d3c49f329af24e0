Celebrations broke out in Nyeri county immediately after the Supreme Court validated the election of President Uhuru Kenyatta yesterday. Thousands of residents broke into song and dance in the Jubilee stronghold. They celebrated by hooting car horns, waving placards, blowing whistles and vuvuzelas, and chanting anti-Raila Odinga slogans. The residents also carried placards of Safaricom and Brookside, whose products the opposition has urged its supporters to boycott. They were joined by Nyeri Governor Mutahi Kahiga and politician Wachira Keen. Occasionally they would stop their procession and pray. Residents praised the Supreme Court and said their prayers had been answered. A vehicle's windscreen was shattered when the owner tried to distract the residents. Business came to a standstill and there was heavy traffic as many continued to join the celebrations. Similar celebrations were reported at Karatina, Narumoru and Othaya towns. In Limuru, residents caused a traffic jam when they took drums and buckets and went around celebrating at Kwambira on the Nairobi-Nakuru highway Police, led by deputy OCPD Samuel Mutungi and AP commander Gitonga Gathumi, pushed them back. “We cannot hide our joy. We voted for President Uhuru and he won. We felt bad when some people went to court to challenge his victory, but we couldn’t do anything apart from waiting for the case to be heard and be determined,” Silas Mwaura said. Limuru MP Peter Mwathi termed the ruling by historic since it was guided by facts. He asked the opposition to accept defeat just like Jubilee did when the court nullified the August 8 presidential election. “It was so bitter to accept. There was nothing we could have done. This time, they should appreciate it and move on to serving the people who elected them,” Mwathi said.
