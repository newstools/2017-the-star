Evelyne Wanjiru Karaba joined the millionaires club after scooping Sh20,621,429 for correctly predicting the outcome of 13 matches of the Betin Jackpot. The office assistant had her stake of Sh399 repay her in millions barely three months in betting. The new Betin millionaire revealed that she was introduced to betting by a friend and slowly grew from multi-bets to jackpots. “I was introduced to sports betting by a friend and decided take the betting journey alone. After playing multi-bets for some time, I decided give a try at the jackpot with the hopes of winning one day, though I didn’t expect it to be this soon. I am overwhelmed.” Evelyne encouraged Kenyans to be responsible in their staking and bet responsibly. She also tipped players to view the Betin betting tips which she always found helpful. The firm’s regional director William Raxon encouraged players to try their luck as there were varieties of bonuses to be won. “While today is about Evelyne, her story is not unique to us. Every day, week and month, our customers are cashing out winnings that are changing their lives for the better. Our tiered bonuses offer clients the chance to win huge amounts on sport each day. We offer more betting markets than anyone else in Kenya, where our customers can play with as little as Sh50 on some of the products. In addition to this, we are the only operator in Kenya, who offer our customers free of charge deposits, with Sh10 free on the first deposit of the day if they put in between 90-99.”
