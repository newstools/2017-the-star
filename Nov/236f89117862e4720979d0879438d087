Two Samburu leaders have criticised church leaders for proposing Constitution amendments to create Prime Minister and deputy PM slots. Samburu North MP Alois Lentoimaga and woman representative Maison Leshoomo spoke in Maralal town yesterday. Leshoomo said the Constitution cannot be amended at this time when the country is unstable. “We are all Christians but we say the Constitution is not a valueless piece of paper,” she said. Leshoomo added that amending the Constitution to create new offices ought to be done when the country is politically at rest. She urged churches and faithful to pray for peace. Lentoimaga said it is wrong to amend the Constitution to create an office of PM and deputies to accommodate people who boycotted the October 26 presidential election.
