Kisumu Senator Fred Outa has accused Jubilee operatives of using state resources to demonise the people of Nyanza as not being development-minded. Reacting to the Nyanza Development Dialogue at Laico Regency Hotel in Nairobi on Friday, he said it was purely aimed at demeaning residents. He accused former Budalang’i MP Ababu Namwamba, Jubilee secretary general Raphael Tuju and Peter Kagwanja of being behind the scheme of belittling people from the region and portraying Nyanza as less developed. Outa dismissed Namwamba, Kagwanja and Tuju as political rejects who have no authority to speak on behalf of the people of Nyanza.  “The conference purported to talk about development in Nyanza as if it is the only region lagging behind in economic development,” said the former Nyando MP.
