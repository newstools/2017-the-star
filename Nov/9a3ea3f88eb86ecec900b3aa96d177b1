The Women In Music Concert Series is an annual event that takes place every November.  It is part of the Women In Music Forum, a platform that seeks to facilitate the interaction of women in the music industry via regular panel discussions and live-music concerts. The gig went down at the Goethe-Institut on November 9 and featured performances by Indi Mandete, Miss Karun and Nina Agot.
