Governor Jackson Mandago has called for the scrapping of the Integrated Financial Management Information System, saying it has crippled operations in counties. Mandago blamed IFMIS for the financial problems in the counties. IFMIS was introduced by the Treasury to help manage finances in government. "It is a horrible system that has made it impossible for us to absorb money and spend. It is useless because it is causing us so many problems," Mandago said. He asked the Inter Governmental Relations Technical Committee to question the Treasury on the continued use of the system.  Governors have called for a better financial management system that can speed up operations while ensuring prudent use of public funds.  "IFMIS sometimes opens and then shuts immediately. It is very frustrating," Mandago said.He was speaking in Eldoret on Friday when members of the IGRTC visited his office in Eldoret. He said IFMIS is an impediment to procurement and payment in county governments. He said IFMIS directives for tendering and procurement are unreasonable.  "Governors have been accused many times of failing to use all the money allocated to counties. All that is because of this system whose controls are not the best for devolution," Mandago said. Â
