Olympic marathon champion Jemima Sumgong has apologised to Kenyans after testing positive for erythropoietin. "I’m sorry to all my family and my team. Four years I'll be back," Sumgong said via her twitter account on Friday. Sumgong was handed a four-year ban by Kenya's anti-doping agency after it proved she used the banned blood-booster. She was the first Kenyan woman to bag gold in the Olympic marathon title during the Rio Olympic Games in 2016. ADAK officials said Sumgong failed an out of competition test in April, days before she was due to defend her London Marathon title.  Her four-year ban has been backdated to April 3. This is the date on which she was provisionally suspended by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). This means that Sumgong is likely to lose her 2017 World Marathon Majors (WMM) title as stated by the organisers. Under Article 13(2) of the World Anti-Doping Code, she has 21 days to appeal the decision. This means that any appeal must be filed with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) by November 20.
