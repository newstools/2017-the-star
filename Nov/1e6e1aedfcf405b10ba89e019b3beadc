KCB Group posted a 5.09 per cent increase in net profit during the period between July and September to Sh15.08 billion, from Sh14.35 billion in 2016. However, compared to the previous quarter, this represented a 46.98 per cent growth when after-tax-profit stood at Sh10.26 billion. The lender attributed the performance to growth in the loan book, prudent management of cost of funds and focus on non-branch channels, despite the full effect of the rate-cap law marred by a slow business environment on account of a prolonged election period. During the third quarter, loans and advances grew by 15.41 per cent to Sh419.49 billion, from Sh364.33 billion the same period last year. Customer deposits also rose 15.6 per cent to Sh496.31 billion. The group’s net non-performing loans declined by 14.7 per cent to Sh11.1 billion from Sh13.05 billion last year. “Our business fundamentals remain strong. We remain optimistic and true to our strategy, even in the face of challenges,” KCB Group CEO Joshua Oigara said. The group’s year-on-year net interest income dropped slightly by 1.05 per cent to Sh35.67 billion, from Sh36.05 billion last year. Total non-interest income increased by 18.4 per cent to Sh17.28 billion, compared to Sh14.77 billion the same period last year.
