Bomet Jubilee Party chairman Bernard Mutai yesterday censured some MPs for inciting workers to demonstrate against Governor Joyce Laboso.  The workersâ€™ services were terminated upon the expiry of their contracts. Mutai said the Bomet governor is still new in office and should be given time to organise her administration.
