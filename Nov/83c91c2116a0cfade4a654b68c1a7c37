City residents prefer risking their lives crossing busy roads and highways, instead of using footbridges. They say the bridges are frequented by criminals. Using them also takes too much of their time. “My first and last time to use a footbridge was on Jogoo Road as I headed from Makadara. Some mikokoteni pullers occupied the whole space and I couldn’t walk past it. I had to wait, despite their slow pace,” Buru Buru resident James Ngetich said. Statistics released by the National Transport and Safety Authority last month showed that between January 1 and October 18 this year, 843 pedestrians died, 547 were seriously injured and 177 were slightly injured in road accidents. “I was once robbed at gunpoint on the footbridge across Jogoo Road near the City Stadium roundabout. I was heading home at around 6pm, when three young boys waylaid me. They told me to let go of my handbag and mobile phone. I felt a gun pointed at my back. I let go of my belongings,” Makongeni’s Mbuthia Wanjiku said.
