The Mombasa assembly has published a notice on the nomination and approval hearing of three executives. They are Seth Odongo (Devolution and Public Service Administration), Hassan Mwamtoa (Agriculture, Fisheries, Livestock and Cooperatives) and Fawz Rashid (Trade, Tourism and Investment). Mwamtoa was former governor candidate Hezron Awiti’s running mate.  There was speculation he was spying for Joho, but the governor dismissed the reports claiming Mwamtoa fits the job. In a notice posted on Thursday, county assembly clerk Salim Juma said the three should appear before the committee on Apportionment/Rules and Procedures at Royal Court Hotel on December 4. Odongo will appear first from 10-11am, Mwamtoa from 11.30am to 12.30pm and Rashid 2.30pm to 3.30pm. The three, nominated last week, are the latest entrants to the 10-member Cabinet.
