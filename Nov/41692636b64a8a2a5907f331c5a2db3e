The Assemblies of Pentecostal Churches and Ministries in Embu yesterday opposed the NCCK’s proposal to form the position of Prime Minister. On Tuesday the NCCK said this will promote inclusivity.  But the Embu churches said creating the post of PM and two deputy PMs will overburden the taxpayer. Twenty clerics converged at an Embu hotel for a press conference. They were led by chairman Bishop Mike Ngare, secretary general Bishop Gerald Thiga and Bishop Silus Njeru. The clerics asked opposition chief Raila Odinga to accept defeat instead of staging demos and fomenting resistance against the government. They asked him to seek legal redress. “We are calling on all church leaders to bring harmony among the citizens so that there can be peace which has been lacking for some considerable period,” Thiga said. The clerics called for prayers and urged churches to be neutral to create cohesion.
