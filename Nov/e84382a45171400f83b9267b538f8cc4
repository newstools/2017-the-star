An election petitioner shocked a Bungoma court on Tuesday when he said IEBC relayed zero votes from his polling station, although he had cast his ballot there. Tale Nabangi lost the Kabuchai MP race to Ford-Kenya’s James Mukwe (pictured with his lawyers) in the August 8 election. Mukwe garnered 18,485 votes against Nabangi’s 18,062 votes. Nabangi challenged the results at the Bungoma High Court. He wants Mukwe’s victory nullified, saying IEBC committed massive irregularities during the election. Nabangi told Judge Abida Aroni that IEBC relayed zero results from his polling station at Buake Primary School. Nabangi said he and his family all voted there. “Despite the fact that I voted at Buake Primary School, the IEBC statutory forms and declaration was that zero votes were cast at the station,” Nabangi said. The station has 469 registered voters. According to form 35B, presented to the court by the IEBC, nobody voted for any of the candidates at the polling station. Nabangi accused Mukwe of bribing, threatening and intimidating voters. “I witnesses voters being chased away from different polling stations,” Nabangi said.  He told the court that he would have won the election had voters at Buake been included in the final tally. Earlier, Aroni had directed IEBC to furnish the court with all KIEMS kits indicating how many people voted in the election.
