Kenyans are on tentacles waiting to hear Lady Jay Dee's new music release after she signed to a Kenyan-based label, Tarus Musik. Sources within the label said the bongo star was given a three-album deal. And the "a hell-a-lotta money was involved" to get Lady Jay Dee to sign on the dotted line. Jay Dee was initially signed by Ali Kiba's label Rockstar 4000 before she jumped ship and signed to Taurus Musik. The label has previously signed the Soulful Pop star Dela Maranga, Kenya’s lover boy, Kagwe Mungai and Zambian boy-band ‘Urban Hype’. This comes days after the Rosella hitmaker divorced her long-term husband over reported domestic violence and infidelity. She then released a break up song dubbed Ndi Ndi Ndi, which was evidently directed to her ex. Months later, she introduced her new boyfriend and singer Spicy.
