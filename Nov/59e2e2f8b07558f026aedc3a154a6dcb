NASA‘s boycott of Brookside, Safaricom and Bidco products is meant to achieve electoral justice in the end, Kisumu Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o yesterday said in an interview on NTV. “The constitutional architecture of our country, as we did it in 2010, left a lot to be desired. This has been exploited by an authoritarian regime to make elections unable to produce just results,” he said. Nyong’o said Kenyans’ votes no longer count. The principle of one-person-one-vote no longer holds, he added. The county chief said a presidential system of government is not suitable for countries like Kenya, which have cultural diversity. He rooted for a parliamentary system. This will be much better and Kenyans should look at the bigger picture, instead of minor issues, Nyong’o said. He said parliamentary systems make parties more significant in electoral processes and reduce conflicts brought about when people fight for only one position — the presidency. The boycott will achieve electoral justice because it focusses on powerful forces behind Kenya’s electoral injustice, Nyong’o said. He said it is not personal, but a matter of principle.
