Eric Omondi has just won an award all the way from South Africa in the StarQt Annual Awards, as the Comedian of the Year.  The awards recognise, celebrate and reward excellent groundbreakers since 2014.  Of all the comedians in Africa, Eric Omondi is the only one who managed to win the award. Eric has worked so hard to be the most recognised Kenyan comedian in Africa. He has actually always wanted to be a comedian since childhood.  What brings him joy is to see people laugh and happy, and that is the main reason why he loves his job. Now he is the most sought-after comedian in East Africa. Â
