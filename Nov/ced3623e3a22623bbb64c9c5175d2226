Police are investigating circumstances under which Rachel Shebesh's husband shot himself in his Kilimani house on Wednesday. Frank Shebesh sought treatment at The Nairobi Hospital after which police were informed of his case. The former Nairobi woman rep's husband told police that he shot himself in the leg during a safety precaution routine. Frank's Glock pistol, which was loaded with 12 rounds at the time of the shooting, was seized for further ballistic analysis. Police say they suspect the shooting must have happened elsewhere and not at the Dennis Pritt Road house as Frank claimed. Misuse of privately owned firearms is rampant in the country lately.
