A number of rape victims are not getting adequate justice in Kiambu since their families are getting compromised, woman representative Gathoni Wamuchomba has said. She said cases which involve incest and where the crimes are committed by family members are hidden and resolved at home. Wamuchomba (pictured) condemned the arbitration, saying those are sexual cases, where culprits need to be punished by law. “We have heard cases where parents or a single parent is asked to accept a decision by the elders when the child is reportedly raped by a cousin, an uncle or any other close relative,” she said. “They are told their family would lose respect. “Some parents say they are threatened, others are given money and goodies to keep quiet.”
