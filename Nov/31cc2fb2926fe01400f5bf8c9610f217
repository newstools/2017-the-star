An impala cheated death after being released from the jaws of a crocodile in extraordinary footage captured in Africa. The clip, filmed near a river in Etosha National Park in Namibia, begins with the huge reptile's jaws clamped firmly on to the leg of the impala, which is breathing heavily after being chased by a pack of wild dogs. But whereas usually being in the mouth of a deadly crocodile would spell the end for the antelope, this time the beast is unable to perform its infamous death roll due to being on land and not in the water.  After at least 27 seconds of having its teeth locked onto the prey's leg, there are audible gasps as the croc gives up and releases its dinner in the remarkable footage filmed on September 12. As soon as the the crocodile's mouth opens, the impala sprints off and the reptile slinks off back to the river.  The person who shot the footage said: 'A pack of wild dogs chased an impala to a river and a crocodile was able to catch it.  'But because the crocodile was out of its element it wasn't able to do a proper death roll to tear the impala into pieces, and so decided to let it go.'
