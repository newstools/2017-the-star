Siaya county illegally transferred Sh15 million from personnel expenditure account to fund non-wage activities in the 2015-2016 financial year, the Auditor General has said. In his report,  Auditor General Edward Ouko says the transfer was made from the Central Bank to an imprest account at Cooperative Bank. “The transfer was in breach of the law since re-allocation of funds from wages to non-wages expenditure is contrary to the Public Finance Management Act, 2012,” Ouko says. He said transfer took place though the budget had not been approved by the county assembly. The audit also faulted Governor Cornel Rasanga (pictured) for spending Sh19.3 million to acquire land for the proposed Barrack Obama University — without consulting the Education ministry. Siaya has also been found to have breached public finance regulations in road projects. Some projects worth Sh350 million were funded without official requisitions. Siaya was also found to have spent Sh22 million to buy a revenue management system that had not been inaugurated despite payment of 90 per cent of the contract sum. “Propriety of the expenditure cannot be confirmed,” Ouko said.
