Lecturers countrywide will continue boycotting work after talks between their union and the Inter Public
University Council Consultative Forum failed. The strike has entered its 7th day and has paralysed
learning in 31 public universities. Speaking to the Star
yesterday, University and Academic Staff Union secretary
general Constantine Wasonga said none of the universities had
negotiated their internal CBA’s as agreed when the strike was called off
in May. Lecturers' CBA is in two phases. The national one covers basic salaries and house allowances and the internal caters for medical cover and pensions among others. However, the Wasonga said the IPPUCF failed to honour this, as none of the
universities had concluded negotiations. “We only agreed on the national CBA, the internal agreement was to be registered by May, but not even one university has honoured that. We will not allow
any of our members to go back to work,”
Wasonga said. He further claimed universities had not remitted close to Sh2 billion for
pension to their retired members. “In the 2010- 2013
CBA was agreed that the government was to fund the pension component
but it has not been released to date, the varsities have also not
been Remitting corporate funds for close to two years now” Wasonga
said. He decried poor funding for research and lecturers' medical scheme. Wasonga said negotiations for a new CBA that would cover 2017-2021 were to begin in May, however, they have not. He claimed the IPPUCF had pushed for implementation of the new CBA to April next
year without consulting the union. “We are behind
time. We are still negotiating for a CBA that has already been
overtaken by time. Other public servants are already enjoying the
2017-2021 CBA yet we are still talking about a CBA that covers 2013-2017,” Wasonga said. Wasonga further told lectures to ignore memos from their institutions, requiring them to report for work.
