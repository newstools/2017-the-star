A Nyandarua county employee has been arrested following the murder of his wife last week. Samuel Gicheha will be arraigned on Monday. The body of Mary Wangui, 23, was found along Ol Kalou-Gilgil road, a few metres from the assembly premises, last Thursday. The mother of one is said to have quarreled with her husband over an alleged affair with a policewoman based at Gichungo police post, Ol Kalou. Her mother Agnes Njeri said this was not their first argument over the allegations, and that they were to meet that evening to solve the dispute. "My daughter had told me the policewoman had sent two messages to Gicheha that morning," she said. "Gicheha took a boda boda ride to my office. My daughter followed him after he called her. We heard later that her body had been found in a bush." Nyandarua Central police boss Wilson Kosgei said they were analysing the couple's communication. "The body shows she was brutally murdered," he said on Sunday. "Her body was dumped in overgrown grass along the road, about 300 metres from the assembly."
