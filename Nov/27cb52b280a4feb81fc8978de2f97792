Women leaders at the Coast have set aside
their political differences and formed a movement to empower others
economically, socially and politically. The Coast Women Power will bring together women from different
sectors including politics, business, religion, education, health, among other
sectors. The movement, which will involve First
Lady Margaret Kenyatta and NASA leader Raila Odinga’s wife Ida, seeks to unite
women and make them speak with one voice. Founder and patron Emma Mbura on Saturday said the
movement seeks to cushion women from the ills the society subjects them to,
mainly because of decisions made by the men. "Women are king makers, but in most cases they
get a raw deal," Mbura said in Vipingo, Kilifi county, during the
movement's first meeting. Already, the membership at the Coast is more than
2,000.
