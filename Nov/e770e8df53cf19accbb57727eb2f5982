THAT some youths were on Saturday flagging down vehicles at Karatina and searching for opposition leader Raila Odinga is appalling. But while that is astounding, the fact that a political heavyweight from Nyeri county was responsible for such an act is equally flabbergasting. The lawmaker is said to have mobilised the youths with instructions to block the NASA leader from attending Governor Wahome Gakuru’s burial. Our mole confirmed that the MP met boda boda operators in the town on Friday night, where he gave them some ‘down payment’ for the assignment. Perhaps police may wish to investigate the incident with the aim of bringing the culprit to justice. ============= A former MP from Central Kenya who lost in the last General Election is a worried man. The ex-MP is said to have failed to repay a loan he was advanced by a microfinance organisation. Last week, the lawmaker received a letter from auctioneers who threatened to put his Runda house under the hammer to recover Sh2 million arrears. It is said the former vocal legislator became broke after differences with his wife worsened, prompting a divorce. With his now estranged wife still angling for the same house that has already been attached to recover the loan, the ‘broke’ politician has been soliciting money from his colleagues to save face from the impending egg hurricane. ============ A youthful ODM lawmaker from Nyanza has deserted his family. The flashy lawmaker, who married days to the August 8 polls, following pressure from elders, has never been to his rural home since he was sworn into office. Most of his meetings at the constituency are held at a Kisumu hotel. Corridors of Power are informed that his wife stormed into one of the meetings over the weekend, accusing the hubby of desertion. The wife hit out at the politician, accusing him of all manner of claims to the utter shock of his constituents and friends. The politician had to beg her to spare him, promising to bring her to Nairobi. The wife is said to have accosted the lawmaker after a friend tipped her off that the MP was in town entertaining contemporaries. Did she get to the capital city? Well, only time will tell. ========== A powerful and influential Jubilee MP known for intimidating parastatal heads is at it again. The lawmaker is said to have sent a threatening message to a CEO of one of the most lucrative parastatals in the oil sector. Reason, the CEO had turned down a request to employ the politician’s niece. Last week he sent the CEO a thinly veiled threat.
