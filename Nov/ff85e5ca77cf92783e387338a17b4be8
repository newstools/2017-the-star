Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati has promised to intervene and end the Nzoia Sugar Company’s woes so it does not collapse. The company is to undergo a two-weeks maintenance programme, but has been ailing because of many problems. “I have information there are squabbles within its management. I’ll have my administration intervene and help wipe them out for the sake of farmers,” Wangamati said on Sunday in Bukembe Catholic Church, Kanduyi. “We will sit down as leaders of this county and help sort out those issues so we don’t lose our only surviving sugar company. He also weighed into the constitutional reform debate and said a presidential election should not be a zero-sum game. The county chief proposed that the Constitution be changed to create a more accommodative executive. “We want Uhuru to consider this or else we might end up going the Somalia or Rwanda way after losing millions of lives,” he said. Wangamati also attended Ndalu Catholic church in Tongaren, where he led a fundraiser for building the church. He contributed Sh200,000. Sh2.3 million was raised. Wangamati urged the county assembly to approve his 10 cabinet nominees so he can run the county properly.
