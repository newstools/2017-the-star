Veteran American gospel singer and pastor Don Moen is in the country. The international praise and worship sensation jetted into the country last night alongside Lenny LeBlanc. The two are set to headline the Worship Concert, which is slated for tomorrow at Citam Karen. It is organised by Aces and Light Events, whose goal is to redefine the gospel events experience in the East African region. The celebrated singer visited Kenya two years ago, when he performed at Mbaraki Grounds in an event titled, 'Worship at the Gates'. Guest performers include award-winning artiste Mercy Masika, Rebekah Dawn, Adawnage and The Worship Factory.
