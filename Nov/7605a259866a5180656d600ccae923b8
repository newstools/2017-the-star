Migori county leaders affiliated to the opposition met the wrath of residents on social media after Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko settled close to Sh265,000 bill for victims of police brutality. News of Sonko paying the bill for the five patients at St Joseph Mission Hospital excited residents on social media yesterday.  They praised him and criticised their leaders. This is the third time Sonko has rescued residents of Migori county. The five victims were still being held at the hospital despite being visited by Governor Okoth Obado, woman representative Pamela Odhiambo and several legislators, all elected on the ODM ticket. The bill was settled through the Sonko Rescue Team after victims called for help through local radio stations.
