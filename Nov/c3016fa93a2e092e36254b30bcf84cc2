A traditional midwife from Budalangi, Busia county, on Sunday helped a 17-year-old girl deliver after health workers at a local mission health centre allegedly turned her away. Talking to the Star in Munginia village on Monday, the girl’s mother said she took her daughter to a local hospital when she developed labour pains, but health workers turned them away, saying they do not work on Sundays. “We travelled all the way from Bukoma to the hospital, 15km away, where my daughter had been going for prenatal checkups. I was surprised when the health workers at the facility refused to attend to my daughter,” the girl’s mother said.  The girl’s mother said in an effort to save the life of her daughter, she sought the help of Agnes Kundu, 70, a renowned traditional midwife. Kundu is said to have helped many women in the area to deliver.  The girl’s mother said the problem has been aggravated by the nurses strike.  “I’m appealing to the national government to move with speed and agree with the nurses so they can go back to work,” she said.
