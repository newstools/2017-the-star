The newly-expanded Village Market formally opened its doors to the public on Friday, with 95 per cent occupancy throughout the shopping and recreation complex. The recently completed retail section of the mall adds 230,000 square feet of lettable space to the development’s footprint, and more than 100 new shops. The seventh expansion phase includes the addition of over 900 parking bays, a business and conferencing hotel, a 14,000 square foot indoor play area for children, a trampoline park, laser tag, 10-pin bowling, a food market and a 30,000 square foot gym – the largest in the region, all of which will open in the first quarter of 2018. The mall’s managing director, Hamed Ehsani, said: “Of all our expansion projects, this is the most exciting...throughout the years, we have sought to understand the needs and desires of Nairobi and to push the boundaries of retail and recreation by introducing the most cutting- edge concepts from around the world.” The expansion project attracts a number of international operators, heralding their entry into the East African market. These include Ignite Fitness, an established South African gym brand, and clothing brands such as Foschini, Celio and Markhams. Trademark Hotel, the development’s hospitality component, is scheduled to open in the first quarter of 2018. The 215-room design hotel will feature conferencing facilities for up to 500 people, and a rooftop pool. Tribe Hotel is the group’s first venture.
