Marakwet MCAs have approved
Governor Alex Tolgos' nominees for CEC jobs amid claims two of them were not interviewed. Interviews for
the jobs were conducted by the Kenya
School of Government. On Tuesday,
social media was awash with claims that Isaac Kamar (Finance) and Kevin Biwott (Roads) did not attend the September interviews. The residents alleged that their names were sneaked in by Tolgos. Newton Kiplagat
claimed that office of the governor delayed in presenting nomination reports of
the two nominees because of the anomaly. But the Committee on Appointments chaired by speaker Philemon Sabulei unanimously approved
the list of 10 CECs. He said the lot passed integrity and competence tests that they were subjected to by the committee. The report was tabled on Tuesday before the proposal was debated on Wednesday morning. Deputy speaker Christopher Kibor
said the list did not adhere to gender and special interest balance. Though he supported the list, he
recommended that the governor should correct the imbalance when appointing
chief officers. The assembly
also questioned the professional qualifications of Roads nominee Kevin Biwott. They said the 28-year-old finance expert was not a technical expert in road
design and engineering. Endo MCA
John Lochaa asked Tolgos to appoint a technical expert to cure the
problem in the roads docket. "I am asking
the governor to carry out daily supervision to ensure CECs who are not experts
in their dockets discharge their duties as expected," Lochaa said. Speaker
Sabulei said the committee completed its work on time to avoid delay in service
delivery to residents.
 The assembly approved nominations of Joseph Kiyeng (Livestock), Leah Rono (Public Service), Anita
Kimwatan (Sports and Youth affairs), and Abraham Barsosio (Water and Natural
Resources). Others are Shadrack Yatich (Agriculture), Edwin Kisang (Education), Anne
Kibosia (Tourism), and Kiprono Chepkok (Health) Â
