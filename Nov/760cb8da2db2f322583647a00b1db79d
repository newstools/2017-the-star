Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has asked the public to ignore advertisements on recruitment by his rescue team. Sonko warned on Monday that numerous people are trying to dupe Kenyans with fake offers. "This is to warn members of the public to IGNORE any advertisement purporting to invite members of the public [to] the Sonko Rescue Team," he said. Regarding recently advertised county jobs, he added: "I wish to make it clear that City Hall employs Kenyans on merit and not through the back door. No amount of bribes given will secure anyone employment opportunity." Several Facebook pages have reportedly been created to carry the adverts.Â The county boss said the pages are fake and should be ignored. "There are over 5,000 fake Mike Sonko/Sonko Rescue Team accounts. My original Facebook page is verified and has over 1.3 million likes. Very soon the long arm of the law shall catch up with them," he said. "We urge [the public] to desist from any communication with these fraudsters." Sonko said he has forwarded information to police for investigations and prosecution of culprits. The county boss noted genuine applications for Nairobi jobs can only be done online or by use of hard copies. "Please do not attempt to bribe any City Hall staff to secure any employment opportunity," he said.
