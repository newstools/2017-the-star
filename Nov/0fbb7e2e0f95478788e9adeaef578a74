NASA leader Raila Odinga has officially migrated his Safaricom line to Airtel following the Opposition's products boycott plan. Last week, the Opposition leader asked his supporters to stop using Safaricom products, saying the firm influenced the presidential election. The telecommunications giant has denied claims it was involved in rigging. On Monday, Raila led a brigade of NASA MPs to the Airtel shop on Koinange Street, Nairobi, for the migration. Supporters of the National Super Alliance are also to avoid products by Bidco and Brookside Dairy. Last week, NASA legislators noted the boycott was part of the economic liberation scheme supported by the People's Assembly. The move is among strategies the Opposition has employed in their national resistance movement. The goal is to bring the companies to their knees.
