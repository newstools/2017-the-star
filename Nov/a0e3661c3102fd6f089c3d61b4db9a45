Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati has finally named his 10-member Cabinet after days of speculation. His list of nominees, however, elicited criticism from some youths and lobby groups, who said it lacked a young person and persons living with disability as required by law. Human Rights Watch Western executive director Job Bwonya yesterday said the organisation will head to court to stop the vetting of nominees. “You can clearly see the governor failed to meet the basic principles of the Constitution such as inclusivity,” he said. Nominees include Richard Sabwami, the principal of Sikusi Secondary School. He has been nominated to the Public Service and administration docket. Other nominees are banker Brawell Murgor (Lands, Urban and Physical Planning), Everlynne Kakai (Youth and Gender), Renson Makheti (Environment and Water), KRA employee and engineer Collins Mukhongo (Roads and Infrastructure). Esther Wamalwa will head the Finance and Economic Planning docket. She is currently the head of finance at Print Exchange Limited, a foreign firm. Mathews Makanda has been nominated to the Agriculture and Livestock docket. He is a private consultant who unsuccessfully contested for the Kimilili MP seat. Dr Betty Mayeku has been nominated to the Education and Vocational Training docket. She is a lecturer at Kibabii University. Dr Antony Walela has been proposed for the Health docket. He is pharmacist. Wangamati said his Cabinet is balanced and meets legal requirements.
