NASA has said it will push for decentralisation of registration of persons to the counties. Principal Moses Wetang’ula said the Opposition will sponsor a Bill to amend the law to allow counties to issue ID cards. The Bungoma Senator spoke during the burial service for Thomas Otipa in Sabatia village, Butere, on Saturday. Otipa was son of Mumias Sugar Company MD Nahashon Aseka. Wetang’ula said this will end the current situation where the government disenfranchises eligible voters by deliberately delaying their IDs in areas perceived to be “unfriendly”.  “We have many Kenyans whose right to vote has been hampered by lack of ID cards. There is an official in Nairobi who retired six years ago who decides who gets an ID,” Wetang’ula said.   The IEBC early this year said over six million Kenyans could not be registered as voters for lack of IDs. Issues around issuance of ID cards generate heated debates during election campaigns. On one hand, the Opposition blames the state for holding onto ID cards of their supporters, but the government says applicants do not collect them after registering. However, passing the amendment will be an uphill task for NASA. Jubilee Party enjoys a majority in both Houses.
