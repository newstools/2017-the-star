Election results forms in Starehe constituency had no IEBC stamp, a researcher told the High Court on Monday. Nyangasi Oduor said upon scrutinising 182 forms 35A from the parliamentary race on August 8, he found "massive anomalies" in 160 forms. "The forms did not bear the IEBC official stamp," he said. He testified in a petition filed by businessman Steve Mbogo challenging the election of MP Charles Njagua. The court also heard that the forms were not signed by the presiding officer and the deputy. Oduor claimed the ballot boxes were stuffed, citing St Peter's Claver's where 16 forms 35A lacked official stamps. He told justice Fred Ochieng' that there was a variation between declared results in the parliamentary election and the actual results tallied by the IEBC in the entire election. The researcher insisted that forms 34B in Nairobi Central ward had a total of 34,585 votes cast yet in form 35B the number was 38,036. Mbogo is expected in court on Tuesday for cross-examination. IEBC has been ordered to file forms 35A and 35B for Starehe constituency. The judge also ordered the commission to avail all memory cards to deputy registrar Elizabeth Tanui. Mbogo wants the court to nullify Jaguar's election.
