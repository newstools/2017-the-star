Thika Town MP Patrick Wainaina will introduce a Bill in Parliament to ban the importation of goods that can be produced locally. The MP on Monday said the government should stop importing items that can be produced by the Jua Kali sector such as wheelbarrows, spades, charcoal jikos and cooking pans from China. The bill will also seek to bar importation of oranges and eggs from South Africa. He argued that Kenyan farmers are able to produce the products in large quantities that can satisfy market demand. Wainaina spoke when he opened Carter Oakhill School in Landless Estate, Thika. The lawmaker said the bill will protect the mwananchi who works in the Jua Kali industry as well as farmers whose products are bought at low prices due to the influx of the imports. “These imports have oppressed our artisans and farmers who sell their goods and products at throwaway prices. Once passed into law, the bill will ensure these people generate high proceeds, which will in turn boost the country’s economy,” Wainaina said. He added that the bill will allow those who want to import the items and products to make the purchases but the duty will be multiplied 10 times the local cost. “If one is only interested in buying a wheelbarrow that costs approximately Sh4,000 in Kenya, from China they can do so but will have to part with not less than Sh40,000.” Wainaina said the bill is designed to create jobs. “Barring the imports means more jobs will be created to sustain demand. Our youth will have something to do to maintain their living standards,” hesaid. “Vices that come along with unemployment like petty crimes, drug abuse and prostitution will become a thing of the past.” The lawmaker said he has consulted residents, farmers and artisans in Thika and its suburbs who say they support the bill.
