Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon has resigned, saying his behaviour may have "fallen short" of the standards expected by the UK military. He told the BBC that what had been "acceptable 15, 10 years ago is clearly not acceptable now". He is the first politician to quit following recently revealed claims of serious sexual abuse in Parliament. The BBC understands fresh claims about his behaviour were raised on Wednesday, but Downing Street refused to comment. Political editor Laura Kuenssberg said that sources close to him do not believe he is "some kind of predator", but that he had not felt that he could guarantee that he would be able to account for every encounter in his long ministerial career. Theresa May said she appreciated the "serious manner" in which Sir Michael had considered his Cabinet role. She also praised the "particular example you wish to set servicemen and women and others". In his resignation letter, Sir Michael said: "A number of allegations have surfaced about MPs in recent days, including some about my previous conduct. "Many of these have been false but I accept that in the past I have fallen below the high standards that we require of the Armed Forces that I have the honour to represent."
