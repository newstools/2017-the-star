Laikipia West leaders have praised the government for resuming eviction of illegal herders in the region. They said the operation should be maintained for the county to continue having peace. Laikipia Governor Ndiritu Muriithi yesterday urged the state not to relent, despite protests by a section of leaders. Last Wednesday, over 300 cows were killed during a shootout between herders and officers in Ratia, Laikipia North. On Sunday, Laikipia county police commander Simon Kipkeu said herders attacked police on patrol. The illegal herders, who were heavily armed, were using cattle as a shield, Kipkeu said. Three-hundred cattle were shot dead. Muriithi has demanded that all illegal herders be evicted. “We want compensation for over 1,500 small holder farms destroyed and 3,250 livestock stolen over the last year. We want compensation for the destruction of Gitumbe farm and buildings burnt,” he said. He regretted illegal herders, believed to be from Samburu, were flocking into Laikipia. The governor asked the national government to ensure people whose farms were invaded and the families of those killed are compensated. . “The invasion has affected many families. That is why we are asking for compensation. Illegal herders have destroyed crops worth millions of shillings. Among those who lost their lives are six police officers killed at Matwiku four months ago,” Muriithi said. Sossian Ward MCA Jacob Edung supported the eviction. His ward has been heavily affected by the invasions. As a result of invasions, Edung said hundreds of residents have fled the area. “We want peace to return. The state should ensure more police officers are deployed,” he said.
