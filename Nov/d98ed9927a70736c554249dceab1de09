Football Kenya Federation (FKF) women’s Premier League side Vihiga Queens have secured a three-year kit sponsorship deal with a sports agency, Just Be Master (JBM). The sponsorship is a boost to the Vihiga county-sponsored team that is eyeing their first Premier league title. JBM were unveiled at Mumias Sports ground on Sunday before Queens locked horns with Eldoret-based Falcon, who they beat 3-0. Deputy governor Dr Patrick Saisi, immediate former county Agriculture minister Nixon Amendi and Vihiga United chairman Kahi Indimuli were among leaders who witnessed the exercise. Queens are currently leading Zone ‘B’. JBM CEO Bryan Oduor said they are happy to partner with Queens as their kit sponsors. He said their move was motivated by team’s performance in the league, adding that Queens are a sea of talent. “Queens are the second team to get JBM sponsorship. We are also sponsoring Zone ‘A’ side Kayole Starlets,” said Oduor. He said they have keenly been following Queens’ performance in the league and are impressed. “They are real queens in football and that is why we are proud to be associated with them,” he added. He said the kit sponsorship is part of their elaborate plans to empower girls. He noted that girls and women are drivers of the Global Goals and powerful agents of change thus the support. The CEO said such programmes are part of their “Leave no woman behind”. Team coach Alex Alumira thanked JBM for their gesture adding that the sponsorship will boost their bid for the title.
