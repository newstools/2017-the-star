NASA has announced a mega rally at Kamukunji Grounds in Nairobi on Thursday ahead of leader Raila Odinga's return from the US. The Opposition leader will land on November 17 following a tour that lasted more than a week. "Organisers of the grand welcome invite supporters to a major rally. The rally will be a dress rehearsal for the Friday grand welcome," Siaya Senator James Orengo said in a statement on Monday. "This is part of our continuing journey of ensuring electoral justice and putting an end to the evil culture of sham elections with pre-determined outcomes. Together we shall triumph." Former Senators Johnson Muthama (Machakos) and Boni Khalwale (Kakamega) also signed the statement. Miguna Miguna on Sunday asked the Opposition chief's supporters to welcome him at JKIA. He did not specify Raila's arrival time. "The National Resistance Movement and NASA coalition invite millions of patriots to walk to JKIA and welcome the people's president."

The Opposition leader boycotted the re-reun saying it would be unfair to go into a race whose results he claimed had been predetermined. President Uhuru Kenyatta was declared winner after garnering 98 per cent votes in the election with a 38.84 per cent turnout. The Supreme Court called the repeat poll on September 1 when it annulled the original August 8 presidential election on procedural grounds.
