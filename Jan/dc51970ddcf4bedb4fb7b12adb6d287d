The Law Society of Kenya on Wednesday struck off 59 lawyers from the Advocates' Roll and suspended 32 of their members over various malpractices.LSK chairperson Isaac Okero told the Star that the complaints that guided the dismissal of the lawyers have been made over the years.He said these were made to the disciplinary and complaints committee who sat and deliberated on the same before giving their verdict.Okero said that due to the nature of complaints by various clients, some were found to be gross leading to the dismissal of the lawyers."Some of the affected lawyers, whose list will be made public as soon as the probe ends, were suspended and given warning letters before they were ultimately dismissed," Okero said.The society, whose role is to uphold integrity of the the legal profession, said that the affected advocates cease practicing with immediate effect.All advocates in Kenya are expected to be members of the body in order for them to practice as representatives of litigants.In latest statistics published at the LSK website, there are 8,326 active lawyers in the country from an estimated population of 13,530.Of these, about 7,720 are male while 5,542 are female; another 268 not declaring their gender. LSK further says that about 3,494 of the lawyers are inactive, while some 624 died.In February 2016, the team of lawyers were split on the planned construction of an Sh800 million arbitration centre in South B, making most of the incumbents lose their seats. Some lawyers christened "Okoa LSK" were not satisfied with the accountability process on how the money for the International Arbitration and Convention Centre was being spent.
