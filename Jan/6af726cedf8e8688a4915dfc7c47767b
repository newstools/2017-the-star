Scores of armed attackers yesterday burned down the main tourist lodge in the 44,000-acre Suyian conservancy and international visitors were evacuated.Stores and garages were also looted.The five Anti-Stock Theft policemen guarding the lodge were overwhelmed by &ldquo;scores or hundreds of attackers. They were young and inexperienced and could not cope,&rdquo; a Laikipia resident said.As armed men entered Suyian with huge herds of cattle yesterday, one attacker was shot dead by the police prompting a violent retaliation.The Suyian lodge is the third tourist lodge in Laikipia to be closed in January. A Pokot invasion forced the closure of two lodges in the Mugie conservancy earlier this month.An estimated 10,000 pastoralists with 135,000 cattle have invaded ranches in Laikipia North in four months. They have been shooting wildlife, including elephants, as well as rustling cattle and looting property.Suyian is owned by the Powys family who came to Kenya more than 100 years ago.The attackers were using walkie-talkies and radios. The attackers are using ammunition from the Eldoret armoury but in Mugie the attackers were also using tracer bullets that are not available on the black market.&ldquo;Rogue middle-level elements within the state are involved in a land grab on a massive scale of up to a million acres,&rdquo; said a Laikipia resident. He said some GSU and KDF officers were assisting relatives among the invaders.Laikipia North MP Matthew Lempurkel denied he was present at Suyian on Sunday when the lodge was burned at 8pm. Staff looking down from the rocks above the lodge during the attack thought they saw him.Last week President Uhuru Kenyatta in Rumuruti ordered that all invading pastoralists should leave the Laikipia ranches. In October last year the Cabinet made the same order.The invasions of conservancies and farms over the last four months have been by Samburu and Pokot from outside Laikipia. However the invasion of Suyian was by Maasai from Mukogoto.
