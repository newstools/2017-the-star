He said Jubilee&rsquo;s tyranny of numbers should not worry the opposition because Western and Nyanza have huge populations that vote as a bloc.&ldquo;They can help put an end to Jubilee&rsquo;s reign of high-handedness and impunity,&rdquo; Omondi said.He raised concerns about the rising cases of corruption, which have reached alarming levels, adding that the opposition would be able to tame &ldquo;runaway graft&rdquo;.
