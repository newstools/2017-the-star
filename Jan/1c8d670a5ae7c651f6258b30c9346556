Ol Kalou MP David Kiaraho on Thursday dismissed as &ldquo;misadventures&rdquo; the recent visits to Nyandarua by Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua and his Meru counterpart Peter Munya.The two governors toured Nyandarua last Saturday to open offices, speak to leaders and aspirants and woo voters. Kiaraho said their efforts are a big joke because Nyandarua is solidly in JP, the President&rsquo;s party. He said President Uhuru Kenyatta, the JP party leader, want all Kenyans to be in one party.Kiaraho said although there is nothing wrong for &ldquo;those two characters to come to Nyandarua and open offices&rdquo;, their main goal was to see the county&rsquo;s beauty. The legislator spoke in Mirangine.He said the two governors and anyone else are free to visit Nyandarua and speak to residents. But he said that will be of no value as no leader will be elected on their parties&rsquo; tickets.Kiaraho (pictured) said Mutua&rsquo;s Maendeleo Chap Chap and Munya&rsquo;s PNU are outfits with no influence and no hopeful should think about joining them. But speaking to the Star yesterday, Nyandarua PNU chairman Billy Njuguna dismissed Kiaraho&rsquo;s views as misguided.Njuguna said Kenya is a multiparty democracy and anyone saying Nyandarua is a Jubilee zone should &ldquo;wake up and smell the coffee.&rdquo; He said PNU will give JP a run for its money and will win the majority of MCAs in the county.MCC governor aspirant Kanja Muchina warned Kiaraho against underestimating the power of democracy, adding they are a friendly party and support Uhuru&rsquo;s reelection.
