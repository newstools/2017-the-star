The High Court has stopped the DPP&rsquo;s effort to charge former Lugari MP Cyrus Jirongo with giving false information linking Jonathan Moi to a Sh50 million land fraud.Judge George Odunga said it would be unjust for DPP Keriako Tobiko to prosecute Jirongo for an offence was committed two decades ago, terming it a misuse of the court. Jirongo was to be charged with obtaining execution of security by false pretences, making a document without authority, uttering a false document and giving false information to a police officer.It is alleged he acquired Sh20 million land 25 years ago in Nairobi&rsquo;s Upper Hill registered in the name of SDL. Jirongo paid the Boits Sh10 million through Oraro &amp; Rachier Advocates and they both remained shareholders and directors of the company. He said the Boits were Moi&rsquo;s proxies. He was then granted the title deed and went ahead to charge the property to City Finance Bank to secure a Sh30 million loan. After clearing the loan, he charged the property again to Postbank Credit for an advance of Sh50 million. But since Postbank Credit had collapsed, the property was transferred to ASL in 2006. He said he paid Sh27 million, instead of Sh20 million.
