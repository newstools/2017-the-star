The move by University of Nairobi VC Peter Mbithi (pictured) to expel staff and students found engaging in political activity this year has angered many in the institution. Word has it that both staffers and students are unhappy with Mbithi, accusing him of being a dictator and undermining their democratic right of associating with any political party. The VC on Friday last week, presiding over the new student orientation ceremony, told all members of the university engaging in active politics to &ldquo;think twice&rdquo; or face his wrath. The aggrieved members, particularly students, are said to defy Mbithi&rsquo;s warning on grounds UoN has produced many politicians in the country, it continues to produce them and that he should not interfere in its political legacy. Whether Mbithi will stand by his word and expel UoN students leader Babu Owino, who wants to become Embakasi East MP, only time will tell. ************Corridors has it that one of the Cord co-principals was infuriated and agitated after a female aspirant uttered unprintable words at him.
