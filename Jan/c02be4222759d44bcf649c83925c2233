Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko has said the Kamba community will support President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto's re-election.Sonko said the perception that community members are watermelons is "fake"."We assure you of our support in the coming election," he said during a phone interview on Thursday.The Senator condemned the recent heckling of Ruto in Narok and Bomet, saying it was wrong for rowdy groups to disrupt meetings by leaders.Ruto had a rough time explaining the Jubilee government's development record to Narok South subcounty residents during his visit last Thursday.The Deputy President had gone to Sogoo trading centre to launch the voter registration exercise and the Last Mile connectivity project.Trouble started when he took to the podium and invited the Narok Deputy Governor Evalyn Aruasa to address the people.Aruasa's speech was cut short by a heckling crowd that demanded that one of their own air their grievances.Kiplele Maritim, a resident, told the DP that he and President Uhuru Kenyatta's administration has done nothing for them despite their support in the 2013 general election.&ldquo;We are together in Jubilee Party but in development matters we are not together at all,&rdquo; he said.Read: Why Ruto must address inequalities in the Jubilee development agendaBut Sonko said: "There is no region in this country that belongs to somebody. Everybody is free to campaign in any region he wants. Let everybody go and seek for votes and respect them, do not heckle them."He also asked youths to shun violence during the campaign period."Be polite and peaceful. It doesn't add up when you fight and get injured," he said.
