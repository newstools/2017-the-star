Former nominated MP Mark Too&rsquo;s died of a heart problem, a post-mortem has shown.Chairman of the burial commitee Jacob Yego yesterday said tests done by chief government pathologist Johansen Oduor show Too had an aneurysm, which is caused by the rupture of a blood vein between the heart and the brain. Yego and Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi said Too will be buried on Monday at his home near the Eldoret International Airport.Earlier, Eldoret-based lawyer Simon Lilan had claimed Too may have been killed because of political reasons and his vast wealth. But Too&rsquo;s widow Sophie said preliminary findings indicated he died of heart complications. &ldquo;We should avoid speculation on the cause of death of Mzee until a post-mortem is conducted and a report released,&rdquo; she said.Lilan said, however, that circumstances had been hatched to cover up the killing and that Too&rsquo;s body was to be taken to the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital morgue, but the family was told the mortuary was full.He claimed Too may have been given a slow poison, which killed him. &ldquo;When you look at the circumstances before and after his death, you come to the irresistible conclusion that this prominent son of our land may have been assassinated,&rdquo; Lilan told journalists in Eldoret. He said he had talked to Too a few days before he died about politics and he had told him he was to sell his land in Nakuru.Too collapsed at his home in Eldoret on December 31. He was pronounced dead on arrival at St Luke&rsquo;s Hospital.
