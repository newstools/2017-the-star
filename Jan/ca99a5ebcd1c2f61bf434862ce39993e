If there&rsquo;s any government that has dealt with corruption, it&rsquo;s the Jubilee administration," Rotich said.Rotich said President Uhuru Kenyatta has talked about corruption "over and over" compared to other administrations.He added: "There must be enough evidence to prosecute someone. If you don&rsquo;t get the evidence, then there might not have been corruption in that specific issue."In 2016, PAC chair Nicholas Gumbo gave Kabura a scolding as MPs, frustrated by her lack of proper explanations, turned to Bible verses.Kabura appeared before the Public Accounts Committee to give answers on the NYS fraud, but she took long pauses, gave short answers and dodged some questions.The Rarieda MP had asked Kabura how she made payments of Sh52 million without receipts. The question of tax returns also arose and the businesswoman said she was in the process of filing them.Read: Frustrated MPs turn to Bible verses during Josephine Kabura NYS scam grillingKabura admitted giving her "friend" Kago Sh60 million in cash without security.Kago was linked to the Sh1.8 billion NYS scandal, in which Kabura is a key suspect, after Sh346 million was wired to his accounts.Read: 'Hostile' Josephine Kabura admits giving Kago Sh60m without securityAlso read: Barclays, Equity among banks to be probed in Sh800 million NYS scandalProminent political personalities have also been linked to the NYS scandal.When probed by PAC, Former Devolution CS Anne Waiguru distanced herself from Kabura."I have never met one Josephine Kabura," said a combative Waiguru. "Clearly Kabura is a puppet. Who is her puppeteer? Everything she is asked, she says 'Anne Waiguru'." The former CS said she had no contact with Kabura as a contractor or on a personal level.She also took the scandal to Deputy President William Ruto's doorstep, naming Ruto's aide Farouk Kibet as a key figure in the heist and said he had 150 calls with Gethi at the time of the scandal.
