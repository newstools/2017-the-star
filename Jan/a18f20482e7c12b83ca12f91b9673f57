Clinical officers have appealed against a decision by the registrar of trade unions barring them from registering their union.Interim secretary general George Gibore said the registrar refused to register the Kenya Union of Clinical Officers in April 2016, yet they had complied with all requirements.The registrar said the clinicians can be sufficiently represented by the Kenya Union of Domestic, Hotels, Educational institutions, Hospitals and Allied Workers and the Union of Kenya Civil Servants, who are listed as interested parties in the case.The officials denied that registering their union would lead to proliferation of unions in the medical sector.&ldquo;The union wants to cover clinical officers. Currently, there exist other unions for the nurses and medical doctors,&rdquo; they said.The officials urged the court to allow the appeal and quash the Registrars letter declining registration of KUCO.They want the court to order the registration of the union.The officials say members of the proposed union of clinical officers are working under challenging conditions because they do not have a mechanism for bargaining collectively for suitable terms and conditions of service.KUCO is currently negotiating salary hikes with the Council of Governors and have secured new monthly allowances of up to Sh20,000 for each clinician.Employment and Labour Relations judge Nduma Nderi directed the parties to appear before him on February 13 for hearing.Separately, the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists&rsquo; Union national officials will appear before Labour Court judge Hellen Wasilwa today, after the lapse of the extra five days they were given last week to end their illegal strike.Wasilwa said the officials would be jailed for one month if they do not call off the strike.The Council of Governors will also respond to an application the officials filed asking for the sentence to be suspended for an additional two weeks.Doctors went on strike on December 5 last year to force the state to implement their June 2013 collective bargaining agreement, which raises their salary by nearly 300 per cent, giving an intern Sh325,000 per month.The government gave them a 40 per cent pay increase, raising the salary of an intern to Sh208,000.The strike enters Day 57 today.However, the Labour Court ruled the CBA is invalid because most doctors are now employed by the counties, who were not involved in its negotiation. Doctors were ordered to negotiate a new CBA.
