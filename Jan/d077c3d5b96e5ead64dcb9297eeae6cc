The taxman has intercepted two luxury Mercedes Benz vehicles concealed as humanitarian and hospital donations at the Port of Mombasa.The cars, which were in a 40-ft container, arrived on September 12, 2016 on board MV Delmas Keta and were destined for Uganda.The exporter's identity and address were listed as 'VShip 36-36Rd street Ste 207 Long Island City NY 11106'.The consignee was identified as Wa-Jo Memorial Medical Centre of P.O. Box 647 Mbale, Uganda; the manifest showed the goods were from Dubai."The names of the exporter and the consignee were suspect to us. We decided to subject the container to scanning process on January 27," said Nicholas Kinoti, KRA deputy commissioner for the Southern region.Kinoti said after the cars were intercepted on Tuesday that upon scanning the container, the images contradicted the declaration in the manifest."It showed tiles at the entrance of the container, assorted items and two vehicles. The tiles and vehicles had not been declared," he said.The Kenya Revenue Authority official said the container had to be subjected to 100 per cent verification as part of investigations.He said Interpol will also be involved in the probe that will establish whether the cars were stolen."Once investigations are complete, the culprits will be taken to court and charged with contravention of the East Africa Customs Management Act," said Kinoti."Interpol will help us unearth the truth and bring the real culprits to justice," he continued, noting KRA would have lost Sh4 million in revenue.Kinoti said they will continue implementing more stringent measures, including intelligence sharing, risk management and use of scanners, in the fight against illegal dealings.Read: KRA, cops probe Mercedes Benz smuggled from S Sudan
