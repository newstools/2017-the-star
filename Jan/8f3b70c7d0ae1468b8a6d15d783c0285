President Uhuru Kenyatta today will unveil more police vehicles leased by the national government.A statement from State House spokesman Manoah Esipisu said the launch is a big milestone for President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s administration.&ldquo;This will enable the police to provide the necessary security, which is an important requirement for economic development,&rdquo; he said.The idea of leasing vehicles was mooted by Uhuru, when he served as Finance minister, in his June 2010 budget. The government later adopted the policy, instead of buying, to cut down on acquisition and maintenance costs.The programme was rolled out in 2013. Before then police vehicles were old and poorly maintained. The lease framework provides a large number of well-maintained vehicles. Esipisu said Kenya has heightened its campaign for Foreign Affairs CS Amina Mohamed for the post of chairperson (and CEO) of the African Union Commission. Foreign Affairs PS Monica Juma last week attended the AU Summit in Addis Ababa, where a number of issues, including elections, peace, security and UN reform, were discussed. Deputy President William Ruto also campaigned for Mohamed in Bamako, Mali, at the weekend, when he attended the Africa-France Summit.
