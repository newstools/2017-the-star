Nyeri Senator Mutahi Kagwe has said NASA was formed to ensure Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka does not become the opposition's flagbearer.In an interview on a vernacular radio station on Wednesday, Mutahi said Kalonzo is welcome to Jubilee "where we are all number one"."Kalonzo was deceived in 2013 when they even reached an agreement where he would be the 2017 presidential flagbearer," he said. "He went round and convinced his people to vote for Cord but we can now see that his co-principals are selfish and have instead formed a new outfit to dupe Kalonzo."Read: Kalonzo no longer playing diplomat, demands Cord presidential ticketKagwe said NASA will not put up a good fight against President Uhuru Kenyatta in the August 8 poll as they lack the common good of the people.The Senator also warned opposition leader Raila Odinga against inciting Kenyans on allegations that the NIS is facilitating the registration of foreigners for voting.Raila alleged that the National Intelligence Service was taking BVR kits to Uganda and Ethiopia and assisting their citizens to register as voters. "NIS is also assisting the citizens of these countries to acquire Kenyan identification documents, cross into Kenya and register as voters," he said on Wednesday.He added that the agency was also registering youths, whose data was collected through the "dubious National Youth Service", without their knowledge.More on this: Raila links NIS to election fraud, voter listing in Uganda and EthiopiaAlso read: Stop the mischief, Raila tells IEBC after 2nd person found with his ID numberBut Kagwe said: "Raila should know we are not snakes; we are the sons of freedom fighters.
