The court has allowed Ahmednassir, Abdikadir and Company Advocates to continue representing the estate of the late Abdulmalek JanMohamed in the Sh45 billion Imperial Bank fraud case.Commercial judge Francis Tuiyott has dismissed an application by the bank and its receiver manager the Kenya Deposit Insurance Corporation seeking to disqualify the law firm managed by lawyer Ahmednasir Abdullahi.IBL and the KDIC, through lawyer Philip Murgor, cited conflict of interest on the side of Ahmednasir&rsquo;s firm in the case in which they are seeking to recover up to Sh45 billion from the former directors of the collapsed bank.Coulson Harney Advocates and lawyer Nani Mungai of Muriu Mungai Advocates will also continue representing the former directors of the bank following the ruling on Tuesday.Murgor had said the two firms hold and are privy to confidential information regarding his client which may be disclosed (deliberately) against them.However, Justice Tuiyott ruled IBL failed to demonstrate how the information could possibly have passed from them to Coulson and Harney Advocates.The law firm was involved in a restructuring process at IBL.The court said it has examined the letters exchanged between Ahmednassir law firm and IBL, and they do not provide any useful information for the case. &ldquo;It must be remembered that the burden of proof is on IBL to show the nature of confidential information and how it is or may be relevant to the matter at hand,&rdquo; the judge said.Tuiyott said the evidence presented to court does not suggest the said firms had a deep or intimate relationship with the bank.&ldquo;IBL has failed to demonstrate that the continuance of the firm by Ahmednassir constitutes a real mischief and real prejudice to its case. Even if the court were to censure Senior Counsel for failing to state the true position, such censure cannot prop up the applicants&rsquo; otherwise weak application,&rdquo; he said.When the case was being heard, the two law firms and advocate Mungai urged the court to dismiss Murgor&rsquo;s application on the ground that there is no conflict of interest as alleged.
