The Nzoia Sugar Board of Management has suspended the managing director and six senior managers for alleged abuse of office.Despite receiving and signing the court order stopping the meeting, the board went ahead to suspend MD Godfrey Wanyonyi and six other senior managers implicated in corruption and abuse of office.Board chairman Joash Wamang&rsquo;oli yesterday said as the meeting was ongoing, a server arrived with the order but it was dismissed for having arrived late after the decision had already been made.&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t recognise this court order, its content is irrelevant and the decision can&rsquo;t be reversed,&rdquo; Wamang&rsquo;oli said. He said the managers led to the company&rsquo;s loss of Sh11.2 million. Project implementation manager Emmanuel Kulundu was appointed acting MD. Wamang&rsquo;oli said they had to make a firm decision to save the company from collapse due to mismanagement.
