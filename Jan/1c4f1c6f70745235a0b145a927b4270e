Kenya will on Monday lock horns with other Africa&rsquo;s regional blocs in the race for African Union Commission chairperson job.President Uhuru Kenyatta has invested millions of shillings in lobbying some 35 countries to support Foreign Affairs CS Amina Mohamed.Amina, the country's candidate for the post, will face off with other aspirants in the election at the 28th African Union Summit in Ethiopia.Uhuru left the country for the meeting on Saturday and is expected to continue with the campaign as well as offer moral support to Amina."Pray for me," Amina told the press on the sidelines of the Summit.The AU chairperson is the chief accountant of the bloc and the spokesperson of the organisation and spearheads relations with other international bodies.Critics have dismissed the campaigns for Amina as a waste of public resources, citing that she has failed badly in her Foreign Affairs docket.Experts believe candidates from French-speaking nations namely Chad and Senegal are in a better position to win the seat.Traditionally, the post which fell vacant after South Africa's Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma stepped down, rotates between Anglophone and Francophone countries.Dlamini-Zuma succeeded French-speaking Jean Ping in 2012.Kenya is pushing for a consensus under the rotational system; but her critics have rejected the idea of choosing a successor based such system.Chad&rsquo;s candidature is said to have been submitted late and could be disqualified on procedural grounds.15 Southern African Development Community (SADC) have always voted with Tanzania.The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), which is always divided along Anglophone and Francophone, only have one candidate.

Ndung&rsquo;u Wainaina, ICPC executive director, said.Read: Ruto's shuttle diplomacy for Amina job to cost millionsWainaina said the investments and attention directed to her campaign is an indication of the selfish interests of business elites targeting opportunities in Africa.Opposition and civil society groups have argued that the Jubilee Administration is fighting for the post for intervention in case they lose the August 8 poll."AU has become bold and strong. They (Jubilee) want her in that position to manipulate other states," Ndung'u said.Also read: Kenya reached 51 AU states over Amina's AU commission chair bid - Matiang'i"However, while Kenya is hiding under EAC, they don&rsquo;t know global dynamics on how to negotiate with other regional and continental blocs," he said.They argue the best candidate should be chosen irrespective of their origin to serve the interests of the continent."As a country, we need to look at our priorities," Ndung'u said, citing unresolved doctors' strike, effects of drought as well as insecurity.More on this: The factors against Mohamed's massive bid for AU top jobODM spokesman Dennis Onyango said: "I doubt a responsible leader would attend a regional meeting on the same day his country has lost over 50 soldiers in a battle with terrorists,"The other candidates in the race include Pelonomi Venson-Moitoi (Botswana's foreign minister), Moussa Faki Mahamat (Chad&rsquo;s foreign minister), Agapito Mba Mokuy (Equatorial Guinea's foreign minister) and Abdoulaye Bathily (Former UN special envoy to Central African Republic and Senegalese environment minister).Deputy President William Ruto, CSs Najib Balala (Tourism), Sicily Kariuki (Public Service), Judy Wakhungu (Environment), Henry Rotich (Finance), Adan Mohammed (Industrialisation) and Raychelle Omamo (Defence) have been leading the campaigns.
