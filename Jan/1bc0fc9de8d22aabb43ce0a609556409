The killing of two rhinos and numerous attempts on others point to a faltering war on poaching, sources say.There have been efforts to end poaching and this is the first time rhino killings for trophies have been registered since 2013. Sources from KWS field stations and the headquarters told the Star the two rhinos were killed in the Ngulia Rhino Sanctuary, Tsavo West, on December 31.They said there have been numerous poaching cases in Lake Nakuru National Park, Solio Ranch, and Meru National Park, with the latest attempts recorded last week in Ruma National Park, Homa Bay. Established in 1986, Ngulia Rhino Sanctuary is home to black rhinos and is used as a breeding ground to help bolster other rhino sanctuaries and wildlife populations.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s depressing, but it doesn&rsquo;t come as a surprise. As we speak, rangers and staff are demotivated as the facilitation that was there before to enable them to collect intelligence, respond to incidences and even carry out daily operation is no longer there,&rdquo; a source said.A field officer said all operations have stalled and they blame it on the headquarters. He said, &ldquo;Today, almost all field cars have broken down. Our choppers aren&rsquo;t operational. Sometimes for the love of our heritage, we use our own cash to hire motorbikes or beg for lifts from tourists to respond to incidents. If nothing is done, the spike in poaching will be back because poachers know our weaknesses already.&rdquo;KWS director general Kitili Mbathi confirmed the killings, but denied having knowledge of poaching cases in other parks, adding that the service is always vigilant to preempt constant threats."There is no reason not to patrol. Its fair to say we have a financial crunch thus we cant buy new cars but the existing old ones we are servicing them well and they are operation. For the choppers one has been grounded for routine servicing and the other has a small problem and will be out for a while," he explained in response to concerns that field operations had stalled as a result of no serviceable vehicle.On allowances and perdiem blamed for bogging down the morale of staff, Kitili said they had introduced tight financial controls and consolidated bank accounts at the headquarters however imprests issues was left at field station to cater for emergencies.On June 20, 216, despite opposition from staff, KWS management closed all field accounts, centralised voucher payments and stopped making payments in cash in all its stations, opening up cashless system where staff claims would be wired to their respective bank accounts, with plans to incorporate Mpesa platforms in future.The June directive stopped all all other allowances including to staff on official duty within their field conservation areas. In regards to travel, releasing stations caters for fuel cost where a Service vehicle is required and bus fare where no vehicle is provided which according to staff is frustrating.&ldquo;This is against the spirit of decentralising services, it means that officers including wardens will have to leave their duty station and go miles away to access their cash leaving loopholes that might exploited by poachers. As we talk today operations in the filed are halting, people are just reporting to work but not working which is detrimental to conservation,&rdquo; a source told the Star in June on the directive.The source added that with the circular's requirement of early planning intelligence gathering and emergency operations will not be able to be carried out.In a response at that time, Kitili said that the idea behind a cashless payments system was to leverage banking and mobile payments technology to streamline revenue collection and payments to make systems more efficient.
