Nzoia Sugar Company managing director Godfrey Wanyonyi alongside six senior managers at the firm were on Monday suspended for abuse of office.The board of directors made the decision despite receiving a court order restraining them from conducting a meeting on the same.Chairman Joash Wamang'oli said the order from Bungoma chief magistrate's court arrived late after the officials had been suspended.He said that they do not recognise the order that sought to stop them from temporarily relieving the managing director and the other six officials.Those sent home included John Wanyonyi - chief ashier; Kennedy Onyango - accountant; and Ben Sitati - cashier.Also suspended was Robert Juma; Kennedy Wanjala - general manager; and Juliet Ng'ang'a - a clerk after the firm lost Sh11.2 million."The officials' suspension cannot be reversed as at now. The court server arrived after we had decided to send them home. We don't recognise it," Wamang'oli said.The seven officials had been arraigned to face charges of corruption, economic crime and abuse of office following the reported loss of funds.Wamang&rsquo;oli said that they had to make a firm decision to save the company from collapse due to mismanagement of resources. The board appointed Emmanuel Kulundu, a project implementation manager, as acting managing director."We cannot allow people who have been implicated in graft to continue serving in senior positions at the company," Wamang'oli said."They remain suspended until the case is heard and determined," he said, adding that the court order was not specific on what the board should stop doing.Juma Sikuta, a farmer, went to court to stop the board from holding its special meeting that had been planned for Monday, January 23, 2017.Chief magistrate Christopher Yalwala certified the farmer's case as urgent and ordered that the application be served for inter-parties hearing on February 6.Read: Charge ex-Nzoia MD with 7 bosses, dig deeper &ndash; farmers
