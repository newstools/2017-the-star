Education stakeholders meet today to decide whether to start piloting the reviewed curriculum from May.Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development chief executive officer Julius Jwan said the purpose of today&rsquo;s meeting is to hear stakeholders react to the work done so far. The KICD will host the National Curriculum Reforms Conference to launch the Basic Education Curriculum Framework at the KICC. The conference will update the public on milestones in the curriculum reform process.Jwan said the Basic Education Curriculum Framework is the outcome of an extensive stakeholder engagement, a national needs assessment study, deliberations from a national curriculum reform conference and several benchmarking studies. &ldquo;If the meeting agrees to the curriculum team&rsquo;s proposals, we expect to carry out the first pilot in lower learning levels &mdash; nursery and classes one, two and three &mdash; from May,&rdquo; he said.Jwan added that if the pilot succeeds, the curriculum for lower primary will be officially implemented in January next year. Rollout for classes four to six is proposed to start in 2019, while classes seven, eight and form one will be in 2020. Jwan said the team&rsquo;s focus is not to change the current 8-4-4 education system but to organise how learning takes place in schools. Proposals by the curriculum team indicate there will be two levels of education &mdash; early years&rsquo; education and middle-school education.
