Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale has said the crowning of ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi as Luhya spokesperson was meant to bring Deputy President William Ruto down. Mudavadi was installed on December 31 in Bukhungu Stadium during a function led by Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli.Khalwale, Ford Kenya deputy party leader, said Atwoli wants to use the position to reach out to President Uhuru Kenyatta and tell him to make Mudavadi his running mate.&ldquo;Atwoli&rsquo;s enemy is William Ruto. They differed when he [Ruto] sponsored a rival team to remove him as Cotu secretary general. He now wants to go and tell Uhuru to drop Ruto and take Mudavadi as his running mate because he has all the Luhyas with him as spokesman,&rdquo; he said.Mudavadi has publicly declared he cannot work with Jubilee. Atwoli named Mudavadi spokesperson after a research by the University of Nairobi rated him the most popular Luhya leader.The crowning of the former Sabatia MP has drawn support and opposition, as well as split elders right down the middle.While some argue that rallying behind one candidate is noble and Mudavadi should assert himself, others say naming him spokesperson will divide the community even more.Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula last week said the function was sponsored by Jubilee, claims Atwoli has denied.Speaking in Navakholo on Saturday, Khalwale said Wetang&rsquo;ula and he &ldquo;have outgrown&rdquo; the politics of Luhya unity that have kept the community in the &ldquo;bathroom&rdquo; every election time.&ldquo;Every election time, a bathroom called Luhya unity is built so that we keep haggling about unity as others grab power. Luhya unity is not the problem at the moment, the problem is a national strategy to remove Jubilee from power,&rdquo; he said.Khalwale said Ford Kenya will support an opposition presidential candidate if he is one of the three Cord co-principals.He said ANC is only creating confusion in the opposition.Mudavadi has been pushing for the formation of the National Super Alliance to take on Jubilee.Khalwale urged Raila to stop pushing his ODM agenda in Western and respect the fact that the region is a Ford Kenya zone. &ldquo;I want Raila and Kalonzo Musyoka to be strong, not because of their strength in Luhya land,&rdquo; he said.
