The county government has sacked seven Kwale Water and Sewerage Company officials for allegedly stealing.Two others have been suspended.The officers are said to be among those doing illegal water connections, while others collect money and pocket it, causing the company huge losses.Water executive Hemed Mwabuzo said the action aims to improve services.He said the company has huge debts because of theft of money by staff.&ldquo;The five sacked officials were either found doing illegal connections or did not read meters well in customers' premises. Others take money and refuse to submit it to the office for documentation,&rdquo; Mwabuzo said.Addressing journalists in his office yesterday, he said some of those fired were using fake company receipts to collect money from consumers.&ldquo;We have interdicted two others for such reasons and once their case is investigated they will be dealt with.
