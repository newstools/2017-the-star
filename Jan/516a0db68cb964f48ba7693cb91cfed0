Kigumo MP Jamleck Kamau has not settled for a running mate in his bid to be the next Murang'a governor.The MP is the biggest challenger of Governor Mwangi Wairia,At the weekend, Kamau said he has not yet decided who will be his running mate because he will not have a politician to second him."I have heard rumours that I have already identified who will help me run Murang'a county, but that is not true. I will settle on one and make it public, but at the moment we are all working with like-minded individuals who want to save our county from being completely run down," he said.Kamau, a two term MP and former minister, said his running mate will help him sell his vision to Murang'a residents.He has been working with Muranga Deputy Governor Gakure Monyo, Senator Kembi Gitura, nominated MCA James Kagoni and Maragua constituency aspirant Mary Njoroge, alias Wamaua, among others. Monyo has fallen out with Governor wairia. They have all been rumoured to be seeking to be his running mate, but the MP is yet to settle on any of them since they are all politicians."In Kigumo, we boast of great education standards, good roads, among other milestones. These are some of the things we hope to spread to Wanjiku," Kamau said.The legislator also criticised WaIria's government for allegedly launching misplaced projects, leading to misuse of funds."It's sad the governor and his team are yet to figure out the needs of our people. It does not make sense to launch distribution of calves worth Sh300,000 and pay for live TV broadcast worth Sh4 million," Kamau said.He said the governor should focus on serving residents. "After the election, we will seek to reclaim Muranga's glory and assets lost due to poor leadership," Kamau said.
