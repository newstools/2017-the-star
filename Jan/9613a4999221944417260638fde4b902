Kigumo MP Jamleck Kamau has cautioned the opposition against politicising the education sector, saying this may jeopardise the country&rsquo;s future.He said education is a pivotal sector and meddling in it could affect Kenya&rsquo;s professionalism in future. Kamau said the opposition should let Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang&rsquo;i to clean up the sector, which has for years been marred by cheating. On January 8, opposition chief Raila Odinga called for a thorough audit of last year&rsquo;s KCSE exam to determine why there was mass failure. He urged the government to take action against those responsible for the dismal performance.Kamau said cheating in national exams has denied many bright and needy children places in good secondary schools because they are taken by cheating children from rich families. &ldquo;Matiang&rsquo;i should be allowed to continue with his efforts to streamline the sector without interference from politicians,&rdquo; he said. Kamau said it is the responsibility of all stakeholders to ensure students pass on merit and further their studies in their areas of choice.
