Private sector activities improved last month compared to November, boosted by higher demand and production ahead of Christmas festivities, a monthly survey suggested yesterday. The Standard Chartered MNI Business Sentiment Indicator for Kenya rose 4.9 points to 62.4 in December from 57.5 in November. This is, however, a slight drop compared to the same period last year&rsquo;s 63.1. Domestic demand rose 10 per cent month-on-month to 70.3 from 63.9 in November, while export orders increased 3.4 per cent. New orders, production, supplier delivery times and employment increased in December, while order backlogs were broadly unchanged. &ldquo;More firms expected that demand, production and profitability were likely to fall in the first few months of 2017, in line with our view that Kenya is likely to experience slower growth in 2017 following recent robust performance,&rdquo; StanChart&rsquo;s Razia Khan said.
