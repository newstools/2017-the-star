Trans Nzoia county, popularly referred to as Kenya's breadbasket, will be one of the key battlegrounds for the Jubilee Party and the opposition on August 8.The cosmopolitan county is inhabited by the Luhya and Kalenjin, who make up about 80 per cent of the population, as well as the Kikuyu, Kisii, Turkana, Pokot and Luo.Jubilee and the opposition enjoy almost equal support and the race for governors is proving to be a titanic battle between the two, as regional political heavyweights fight for the seat.The county had 244,640 registered voters in 2013 but the figure could go up to 350,000 this year.In 2013 Governor Patrick Khaemba garnered 89,053 votes to beat his rivals, who, however, showed an impressive performance that could be replayed again this year. Former Cabinet minister Noah Wekesa came second with 37,988 votes while former UN employee Maurice Bisau, of the now-defunct New Ford Kenya, got 33,177 followed by Joel Osare Gisuka who got 29,030.Khaemba, who will defend his seat through Ford Kenya, says he is confident of winning a second term. He, however, faces an uphill task, with twin battles within Ford Kenya and then in the main race with other parties.His record as governor has been riddled with claims of high-level graft in all sectors of his administration. With more than 15 of his top managers facing graft charges in court, the governor will have hard time defending his record.&ldquo;So many projects initiated by Khaemba&rsquo;s team have stalled due to graft and this will be a major factor when he seeks a second term,&rdquo; civil society activist Ben Simiyu said. He accuses Khaemba of presiding over an administration that messed up with tendering, procurement and management of public facilities, such as hospitals. As a result residents have not fullyed enjoy the benefits of devolution.Overall, Khaemba he says he has achieved 90 per cent of what he set out to do in 2013 and poverty levels have reduced to less than 46 per cent.In health, he says construction of the Sh1 billion Kitale Teaching and Referral Hospital is nearly complete. It has also refurbished the Mt Elgon Hospital and the Kitale District Hospital, where it has installed new equipment.&ldquo;We have also opened 30 new health centres in all areas of the county and ensured all hospitals have adequate drugs round the year. We have also started a medical training college to help train the staff we require in the health sector. We bought six ambulances to move patients free of charge. We plan to equip the referral hospital at a cost of another Sh 1 Billion and later on employ more than 400 new staff so that Trans Nzoia residents get all medicals services they require in Kitale&rdquo;, he says.In the water sector the county has so far completed 15 major water projects and more than 150,000 people have been supplied with clean water.The county government has put up more than 100 ECD classes and another 400 more classes have been developed using the new EPS technology. 800 ECD teachers have been hired and enrolment to the ECD classes has increased from 16,000 children to more than 35,000.The county has also developed vocational training centers in all our 25 wards, employed tutors and provided other training facilities.In Agriculture, Khaemba says through his county initiative to distribute cheaper Mavuno fertilizer to farmers maize production has increased from 12 bags per acre to about 35 bags in four years..The County has put up 22 markets in rural areas to help farmers sell their produce.Street lighting progammes in Kitale town, installation of high mast light systems at major markets in areas like Matisi and Kipsongo have helped improve security and enable 24 hrs trade.The county has been facing a historical land problem but through the National Land Titling Programme so far more than 88,000 titles have been issued to residents and another 150,000 are being processed through the initiative on which the county has used Sh 40 million.Khaemba says the infrastructure in Trans Nzoia is far better with more than 2,500 kilometers of roads improved and the county used more than Sh 450 million to buy its own road construction machinery now working in all sub counties.Despite the achievements, within his Ford Kenya Khaemba is fighting a revolt after branch officials of the party disowned him questioning the governor&rsquo;s loyalty to party leader Moses Wetangula and his links with DP William Ruto.Party officials Edward Munabi and James Wambisi said Khaemba has failed to adhere to the party policies and ideologies. &ldquo;The party will seek another aspirant to replace Khaemba&rdquo; said MunabiBut Khaemba is the only Ford Kenya governor and vows to remain in the party. School Principal Cosmas Nabungolo and Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa are among those who may seek to fight with Khaemba for the Ford Kenya ticket but the two are yet to come out and declare their stand.&ldquo;I have no problem with Ford Kenya and that is the party I will use to defend my seat in August&rdquo;. Said Khaemba.CS for Water Eugene Wamalwa, Wekesa, Bisau and journalist Joshua Arap Sang are the four top aspirants expected to fight for the jubilee ticket.Analysts say the jubilee battle will likely be between Wamalwa and Bisau who appear to have equal strength on the ground.Both are from the Bukusu community which is populous in the region but the CS enjoys a wider political clout on his own and riding on the name of his late brother and former Vice President Michael Wamalwa Kijana.Wamalwa&rsquo;s decision to abandon his earlier move to vie in Nairobi will change the political arithmetic in Trans Nzoia because of the respect and influence he wields within the Bukusu community.&ldquo;The CS is youthful, a good orator and he can be very down to earth and accessible than other aspirants in Jubilee. He is likely to win the ticket and even clinch the governorship&rdquo;, said Wamalwa&rsquo;s supporter Mary Waswa.But Bisau, Wekesa and Sang are promising to put up a fierce battle for the jubilee ticket with Bisau already having set up a nerve center to coordinate his campaigns.&ldquo;Trans Nzoia deserves better leadership and not that interested in perpetrating graft, misuse of resources and lack of priorities as has been the case with the current administration&rdquo;, says Bisau who is considered well equipped in terms of professional management skills.Ruto has been criss-crossing the region to boost jubilee&rsquo;s chances in this year&rsquo;s polls and analyst say he may help to tilt the balance of politics in the county where many of Kenya&rsquo;s top politicians have large scale farms.The influence of Wetangula and ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi may also play a role in Trans Nzoia, a region that has also produced key political players including State House Political Adviser Joshua Kuttuny who will vie in Cheranganyi and former Agriculture Minister Kipruto Kirwa who will be seeking the Senate seatIn 2013, Ruto&rsquo;s and Ford Kenya shared the parliamentary seats and while the New Ford Kenya also took up some of the MCAs seats in the region. This year a similar political mix could emerge in Trans Nzoia.Fact Box Name-Trans NzoiaHeadquarters-Kitale townGovernor-Patrick KhaembaArea-2,495 Km2Population-575,000Trans-Nzoia county is located in the North Rift with Kitale town as its capital.
