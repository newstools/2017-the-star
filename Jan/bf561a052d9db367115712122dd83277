Devolution CS Mwangi Kiunjuri has sought divine intervention in his bid to vie for Laikipia governor in the August 8 poll.Kiunjuri resorted to this as the February deadline looms for civil servants considering political seats to vacate public offices.During a Sunday service at PCEA church in Nanyuki town, Kiunjuri asked congregants to pray for him as he had only three weeks to decide whether to continue with his duties as a minister or resign to contest for the seat."I am seeking your divine intervention because I have only three weeks to make a decision. I am also consulting with the President over the matter," he said.The Cabinet Secretary said his heart was set on working for the people, and that this was why he went back to his church to ask for prayers.Nominated MP Sarah Lekorere, who was at the service, urged him to declare his candidature saying the people of Laikipia want him back.The CS served as Laikipia East MP between 1997 and 2013. He lost his bid for governor in the 2013 general election but was still seen as a political asset for President Uhuru Kenyatta.Over the holiday, Kiunjuri held meetings with elders and county leaders to get their views on his future in the county's politics.More on this: Kiunjuri, from tout to ministerShould he enter the race, Kiunjuri will face off with former Laikipia West MP Ndiritu Muriithi, former foreign affairs permanent secretary Thuita Mwangi and area deputy Governor Gitonga Kabugi.Others are county secretary John Mwaniki, hotelier Mburu Kamau and technocrat James Mathenge.
