Nairobi residents will face more water rationing as water levels at the Ndakaini Dam continue to drop, Water CS Eugene Wamalwa has said.Areas that have been receiving water four times week will now only get it three times, while those that have been getting water three times will now have it twice, he said.This is after water levels at the dam that supplies 80 per cent of domestic water in Nairobi dropped to an all-time low of 41.5 per cent.Wamalwa said the last time water levels at the dam dropped to such levels was in 2011. He spoke on Tuesday during a tour of the Ndakaini Dam, the Northern Collector Tunnel and the Aberdare Forest.The government is putting up massive infrastructural development to deal with the challenge of drought in the future, he said.Nairobi has a population of more than six million people during the day and more than four million at night. Water supply continues to be strained as the population swells, the CS said.He added that the city requires 700 million litres of water every day but is only able to supply 500 million litres of water that has now been decreased to 400 million litres. &ldquo;We must look at alternative sources of water as climate change becomes a reality,&rdquo; Wamalwa said.He said the Meteorological Department warned late last year that Kenya would face a drought that would last up to the long rains in May. The Water ministry will ensure the available commodity serves Nairobi residents until then, Wamalwa said.&ldquo;We have an interdepartmental agreement that we have to be ready for a situation where the rains don&rsquo;t come in May and we have set aside Sh7 billion to cater for that,&rdquo; he added.Wamalwa also noted that the Northern Collector Water Tunnel that is meant to convey 142 million litres of water to Ndakaini Dam every day is 20 per cent complete and will be operational by June next year.&ldquo;This tunnel will help us to harvest flood water during rainy seasons to mitigate against droughts such as the one we are facing now,&rdquo; the CS said.He said the Cabinet is taking measures to ensure no lives are lost in areas severely affected by lack of water.
