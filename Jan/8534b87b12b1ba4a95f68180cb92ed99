Sirisia MP John Waluke has dismissed as propaganda reports that Deputy President William Ruto was heckled in Bungoma town on Monday.Youths reportedly blocked Ruto from addressing a roadside rally at the Bungoma bus terminus. Pictures doing the rounds showed youths chanting NASA and Cord slogans as they tore Jubilee campaign materials at the Bungoma bus station.However the Deputy President&rsquo;s office has denied Ruto was heckled. Officials said he was not scheduled to hold any meeting at the Bungoma bus station.Ruto&rsquo;s entourage is said to have made a detour some 10km from Bungoma town, where the youth were preparing to heckle and boo him for unfulfilled promises.Waluke, who is also the Bungoma Jubilee Party chairman, said the DP&rsquo;s itinerary did not include Bungoma town.&ldquo;This is social media propaganda being driven by our competitors who fear Jubilee&rsquo;s inroads in the county. You cannot heckle somebody who is not present in the first place,&rdquo; he said during a press conference at Parliament Buildings.Waluke said the Jubilee officials have made arrangements for Ruto to tour Bungoma in two weeks.
