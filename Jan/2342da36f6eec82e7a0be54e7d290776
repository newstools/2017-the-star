A backlog of high-profile graft cases awaits ex-ACK Archbishop Eliud Wabukala (pictured) at the EACC. It has been revealed a parliamentary committee has endorsed him for the top job.It will also be a litmus test for Wabukala to ensure politicians vying in August 8 polls have no integrity questions.The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission, together with the IEBC, works to clear candidates to ensure they comply with the Leadership and Integrity Chapter of the Constitution.The Star has learned National Assembly&rsquo;s Justice and Legal Affairs Committee chaired by Samuel Chepkonga (Ainabkoi) threw away a memorandum rejecting the appointment of Wabukala.Four petitioners, the Rev John Mbugua, Gilbert Mukabane, Eric Abu and Jeramba Munuhe, termed the retired archbishop unfit to chair the EACC for supposedly abusing his office by &ldquo;baptising, burying and officiating the weddings of thieves&rdquo;.&ldquo;We dismissed the memorandum because it lacks substance. We only considered it during t vetting, so petitioners would not complain. We are waiting for Parliament to approve his appointment on Tuesday next week,&rdquo; a source said.Wabukala&rsquo;s confirmation will disappoint some fellow clerics who demanded the anti-graft commission be disbanded for failure to stem corruption.National Council of Churches Kenya secretary general Peter Karanja and other clerics late last year asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to put pressure on MPs to hasten repeal of the EACC Act 2011 to create a directorate to investigate and prosecute graft cases.The commission is investigating a record 411 cases involving national land county officials. Wabukala must conclude them. EACC chief executive officer Halakhe Waqo said 910 suspects, some of them prominent, are in court.Waqo said high-profile cases include the National Youth Services and Anglo Leasing scandals. The commission is probing 26 county governments over massive graft in procurement.Governors of Busia, Isiolo, Taita Taveta, Samburu, Meru, Siaya, Murang&rsquo;a and Kisumu are supposed to be taken to court before the August election for not observing the EACC code of conduct in fighting graft, Waqo aid. &ldquo;I have punished people in the church who have done wrong,&rdquo; Wabukala said, adding he will not flinch in carrying out his mandate.
