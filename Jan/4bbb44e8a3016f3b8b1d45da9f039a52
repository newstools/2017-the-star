First of all, I don&rsquo;t like the law that Parliament put in place to make it mandatory for public servants who want to run for office to quit six months to a general election. Before that, public officers used to have a minimum of three months. So as long as that law is not challenged, or overturned by a court of law, then it is the law. There are no two ways about it.I don't think it is necessary for public officers to leave office that early. My beef is that this law is discriminative, because it only says public officers who want to vie must resign while serving leaders serve until the end.This is already discrimination, because you are saying even if you are elected, then you continue earning your salary until the election. On the other hand, you are saying if you are doing another job, say, hired by a parastatal, you must quit 24 weeks before Election Day.I have never understood the logic of it, but the reason could be if you are running for public office, it is a safeguard against tendencies to misuse public resources for your own purposes.When I was running for President in 2012, I had to resign 10 months earlier, so six months is okay, let them go home, they need to have the time to campaign. It makes sense that they leave office so that there is no conflict of interest.So, let these guys go and campaign, it is not a question of opinion but of the law.As for the issue of giving jobs to political losers, my opinion is that every Kenyan is entitled to a job, to serve this country. If you don't win the election because it is too competitive, that does not mean you are no longer qualified to serve.Look at US Secretary of State John Kerry, he was a presidential candidate and he lost, but President Barack Obama picked him as Secretary of State. Obama picked Hilary Clinton as well after she lost to him and made her Secretary of State, recognizing that she was experienced and a very smart individual and of benefit the country.The problem we have here in Kenya is that they do not give jobs to the people selected on the basis of merit.
