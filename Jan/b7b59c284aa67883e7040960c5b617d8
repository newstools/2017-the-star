Cord leader Raila Odinga has told residents of Meru he is not their enemy but the Jubilee administration has hoodwinked them to think they a united sub-community of the Kikuyu whose leaders have branded him an enemy. Speaking in Meru town, Raila said Kenyans are tired of skewed distribution of national resources, graft and alleged political assassinations. He said Kenyans there is no development. Citizens have the ability to remove Jubilee from power, Raila said.&ldquo;They bring politics of tribes and keep saying the people of Central have to vote as brothers and I wonder what I have done to be branded the enemy of the people from this region. I am closer to you and you are cheated that I&rsquo;m your enemy. They are just using the divide and rule method to cause tension,&rdquo; he said.Raila criticised Tigania East MP Mpuru Aburi, who recently defected from ODM to Jubilee. He said he lifted the legislator up from councillor to an MP.&ldquo;Now that he has grown up and matured in politics, he has gone to lick the buttocks of Uhuru. When you were elected the people knew you were in ODM and now you have moved to Uhuru for personal interest,&rdquo; Raila said.He said President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto have failed to manage development because he is not in leadership. &ldquo;During the coalition government, where Uhuru, Ruto, [Musalia] Mudavadi and Kalonzo [Musyoka] were ministers and I was their boss, work was done. I used to task them because they were ministers in my government. Now that I am no longer there they can&rsquo;t work,&rdquo; Raila said.
