Police will arrest car wash operators defying orders to close during the water shortage.&ldquo;It is inhumane for someone to go without water to drink, yet someone else uses it to wash cars,&rdquo; the Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company spokesman said yesterday.&ldquo;We better use the little water we have on essentials, instead of washing cars,&rdquo; Corporate Affairs manager Mbaruku Vyakweli told the Star yesterday.Last week, the company banned the car-wash business to conserve water.However, a number of roadside car washes in many parts of the city are still operating.The company ordered a crackdown on big water users and has partnered with police to enforce the shut-down.It is also reviewing the rationing schedule for residents.Speaking on the phone, Vyakweli said water levels in the 70 million cubic metre-dam has dropped to less than 45 per cent.&ldquo;Areas that used to receive water once or twice a week have not been affected. But those receiving it three or four times, will now receive it on fewer days,&rdquo; he said.The drop has been caused by a prolonged dry spell in Kikuyu, Aberdares and Mt Kenya, the main water catchment for rivers serving the dam.NCWSC managing director Philip Gichuki said water rationing will continue until the long rains begin in March or April.Many residents have been forced to buy water from vendors, who have taken advantage of the shortage and increased prices.In some areas such as Mathare, the price for a 20-litre jerrican has gone up five times.&ldquo;We are paying Sh50 from Sh10,&rdquo; resident John Omondi said.The county is planning to sink 40 boreholes for Sh200 million in a month to ease the shortage.
