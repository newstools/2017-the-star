Duale allegedly told youths to chase away and prevent Kambas from registering as voters in Garissa.Duale dismissed the clip as &ldquo;concocted propaganda.&rdquo; &ldquo;If there are serious incitement and hate speech issues, it has come from the Jubilee leadership, starting from the top leadership to the last person. But no action has been taken,&rdquo; Muthama said.He said Cord takes utterances in the clip &ldquo;seriously&rdquo;. Muthama urged the NCIC to&rdquo;move swiftly to have Duale arraigned in court immediately.&rdquo;NCIC chairman Francis Ole Kaparo confirmed to Star that officers will investigate. &ldquo;I was informed last night [Thursday]. I have not listened to the clip, but definitely it has to be investigated. We must get the clip give it to responsible officers and investigations begin,&rdquo; Kaparo said. Muthama questioned why President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto have remained quiet on Duale&rsquo;s alleged remarks. &ldquo;That is a very clear confirmation he is representing Jubilee,&rdquo; he said.
