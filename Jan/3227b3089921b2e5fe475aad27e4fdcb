The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission has been enjoined in a case challenging new rules issued by Chief Justice David Maraga that requires all corruption cases be prosecuted in Nairobi. Maraga came up with the &lsquo;Practice Directions for the Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Division of the High Court&rsquo; when he launched the new court in December last year. The Director of Public Prosecutions, the Asset Recovery Agency and law student Charles Omanga were also enjoined in the case as interested parties. Justice Roselyne Aburili set the hearing for February 3. Justice George Odunga had earlier disqualified himself from the case on grounds that he was part of the committee that drafted the rules. Lawyer Peter Wanyama, who challenged the matter, says the CJ violated the law for failing to get input from the public and the LSK and parliamentary approval.
