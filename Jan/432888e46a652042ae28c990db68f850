More than 400 Embu matatu drivers yesterday threatened to strike after their employers&rsquo; sacco forbade them from wearing uniforms branded with a governor hopeful&rsquo;s name. The drivers in the Digital Drivers&rsquo; Association planned to stop work, demanding to wear the T-shirts donated by Leonard Muriuki.
