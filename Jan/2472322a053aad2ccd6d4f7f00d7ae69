University and college students across the country have been warned against being used by politicians to cause mayhem in rallies ahead of the polls.Bishop Maurice Wanjala of Pefa Church in Sinoko, Webuye, said university students are the face of the country and future leaders.He was speaking during Sunday service. Wanjala said Kenya needs a peaceful election, which can only be attained if students refuse to be used to cause violence. &lsquo;&rsquo;We have seen a lot of reforms in the education sector, which will now produce fully baked and responsible members of the society from primary, high school to university and colleges. This must also be seen in this election year,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said.Wanjala said Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang&rsquo;i has done well in cleaning up the sector. &lsquo;&rsquo;Any student who allows himself to be used by politicians should not forget that the same politicians have their own children but they can never allow them to be used in such incidents,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said.&lsquo;&rsquo;Even if they give you money, you must refuse it and be guided by your conscience.&rdquo; Wanjala urged religious leaders across the country to pray for politicians so they may have the wisdom to spread uniting messages.
