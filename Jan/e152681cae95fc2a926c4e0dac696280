The World Food Programme has suspended feeding programmes in Pokot North subcounty. West Pokot county representative Harun Siwatum said more than 35,000 pupils in 65 schools will not get food in the first term.&ldquo;I know it will be painful because most head teachers and pupils have been waiting for the food since schools re-opened. But the fact of the matter is that there will be no meals in first term,&rdquo; he said. Siwatum spoke on Tuesday during the West Pokot County Steering Group meeting in Kapenguria town. He said severe funding shortfalls forced the WFP to suspend the programme. Siwatum said the earliest it can resume is in April.The programme has been feeding 20,095 boys and 15,975 girls in 65 schools. WFP has been supplying food to all subcounty primary schools.The drought is worsening the shortage of food, water and pasture. Siwatum said supplying food to refugees in Kakuma and Dadaab is an enormous financial commitment and a logistical challenge for the WFP.He said in future, the organisation will provide cash to schools to buy their own food and reduce costs.&ldquo;For a long time, the WFP, which is a UN agency, has been using a lot of money to transport food from the Port of Mombasa to schools in North Pokot,&rdquo; Siwatum said.The CSG members said the WFP&rsquo;s decision will reduce enrolment in schools. Henry Katuria from the education office said they are not aware of the decision to cut food supplies. He said since the feeding programme started, enrolment has gone up and many pupils have remained in school. &ldquo;The situation in Pokot North is wanting and worsening as days go by. The most affected are the children and WFP&rsquo;s decision would automatically worsen the situation,&rdquo; said Joseph Akoule from an NGO Sikom.
