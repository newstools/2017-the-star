Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery has rebuked errant administrators saying those who sympathise with the Opposition have no business being in government.Nkaissery said in Kajiado county on Tuesday that he was aware that some chiefs and their assistants were undermining the government.They will be sacked, he warned, and directed county commissioners to profile them ahead of the August 8 election. The CS said the government has no plans to rig the elections or play a rough game against those in the opposition.He said their only intention is to provide a level playing ground for parties seeking elective posts."We all need a credible election for the sake of unity among Kenyans. We will be defending the presidency and therefore, we will be hitting the campaign trail like our friends in the opposition," he said.The CS spoke at Maasai Technical Training Institute and will hold similar meetings in Kiambu, Nyandarua, Laikipia, Narok and Kisii.Nkaissery said it was worrying that the county was not doing well in the registration of voters."In the last three days of mass voter registration, only 6,321 people have been [listed]," he told the administrators."The government is providing you with transport and airtime yet you are sitting there idle and not helping in the registration of voters. What do you think you are when earning money from the same government?" He said members of the provincial administration should be on the front-line in the issuance of uncollected identification cards and the registration of voters countrywide.Nkaissery further said the government was planning to transfer chiefs to other counties so they can be more effective."Once this programme has been put in place, chiefs from Kajiado can be transferred to serve in regions such as Turkana and Garissa," he saidRead: Jubilee exploiting voter registration, IDs issuance at ODM's expense - Mbadi
