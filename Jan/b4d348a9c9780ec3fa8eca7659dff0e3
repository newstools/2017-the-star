A white supremacist has been sentenced to death for the racially motivated killings of nine black people at a South Carolina church.Dylann Roof was convicted last month of 33 federal charges, including hate crimes, after opening fire on a Bible study group in 2015.He remained unrepentant and had told the jury: "I felt like I had to do it and I still feel like I had to do it."The jurors deliberated for nearly three hours before reaching their verdict.The massacre shocked the nation and reignited a debate about race relations and the flying of the Confederate flag.Roof told police he wanted to start a race war and he was photographed holding the battle flag, which to many is a symbol of hate.The tragedy led to the flag being removed from the South Carolina statehouse, where it had flown for 50 years.
