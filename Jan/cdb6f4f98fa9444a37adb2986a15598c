Nairobi county will lose more than Sh6.2 million every year if a citizen&rsquo;s petition seeking to scrap charges to use public toilets succeeds.Resident Adrian Kamotho last week petitioned the High Court to order the Council of Governors, the Kenya National Highways Authority and Kenya Urban Roads Authority to scrap the levy on use of public facilities.Nairobi, which has a population of five million people, has 68 public toilets. Seventeen are within the Central Business District.The toilets are owned by the county council and rented out to individuals and community-based organisations at a fee, depending on the location.&ldquo;When these tenders were advertised, preference was given to youth groups, people with disability and organised groups like women,&rdquo; Peter Kimori, the Nairobi Environment Executive, told the Star in an interview yesterday.City Hall charges Sh15,000 monthly to rent toilet facilities in upmarket areas, including the CBD, and Sh5,000 in estates and low-income areas.Loos a right, not privilegeThe tenants often charge Sh5 to enter the public facility and Sh10 in those that give toilet paper. However, the charges depend on the locality of the toilets.Kamotho, in an interview with the Star, argues the agencies charged with management of the facilities are &ldquo;obstructing members of the public from using public toilets&rdquo;.&ldquo;Public toilets should be numerous, situated conveniently, regularly cleaned, free to use, and open all hours, as using the toilet is a natural act and should be treated as a human right, not a privilege,&rdquo; he said.In the year 2000, the public toilets fell into disrepair. The Nairobi City Business District Association secured permission from the now-defunct Nairobi City Council to operate them.&ldquo;It was really very bad because the toilets were in a total mess. They requested that they take over control of the facilities and in return a small fee be charged to the users so that it acts as a revolving fund to maintain the toilets, to buy sanitary towels and that&rsquo;s how the money was being used,&rdquo; Kimori said.We pay tax, toilets should be freeHowever, the opponents of the fee say the government has a responsibility to offer free sanitation services to its residents, as they pay taxes in other forms.&ldquo;We want City Hall to be responsible and take care of the toilets. &ldquo;They should employ people to come and clean the facility because it is part of services the county should offer, as we pay taxes in other forms,&rdquo; Victor Otieno, a Kibera resident, said.
