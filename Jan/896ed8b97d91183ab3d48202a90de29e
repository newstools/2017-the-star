I am preparing for debut in London this April,&rdquo; said Vivian.Kamworor said: &ldquo;My main aim is to concentrate on the world cross title defence and so I will not be at the Police championships.&rdquo;The two won the respective titles during last year&rsquo;s event held at the same venue and despite their absence, the event is still expected to illuminate the city as the service boosts of a galaxy of top stars in the Kenya and international circles.In Kamworor&rsquo;s absence Matthew Kisorio and guest runner Moses Mukono, who is eyeing a comeback after one year in the cold, will be seeking to jostle for honours.Augustine Choge, Josphat Bett and Johnson Nakari, all of whom finished in the top six last year will also be looking to better their performances. &ldquo;I want to see where I am following the rigorous training I have been doing, with the aim of making the national team to the world cross country championships set for Kampala in March,&rdquo; said Mukono.In the women&rsquo;s race, Stacy Ndiwa, who is returning from maternity leave will be hoping to take advantage of Vivian&rsquo;s absence and take the title.She will battle it out with the likes of Maragaret Chelimo, world 3000m steeplechase silver medallist Hyvn Kiyeng, Janet Kisa and Linet Masai.Kenya Prisons Service will also welcome their top stars at the Uhuru Gardens with former world half marathon bronze medallist John Mwangangi leading the roster.Mwangangi, a former Africa cross champion, will be chasing the honours alongside newly recruited Olympian Charles Yosei as well as regulars Mangata Ndiwa, Timothy Kiptoo and Fredrick Musyoki.Africa cross champion Alice Aprot, fourth in the 10,000m at the Rio Olympics, headlines the women&rsquo;s list alongside 2016 Paris marathon Visiline Jepkesho, Nancy Nzisa and Nancy Kimaiyo.
