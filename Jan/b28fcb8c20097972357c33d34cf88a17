Rift Valley leaders have insisted that Aden Duale apologise for "demeaning" retired President Daniel Moi at former Nominated MP Mark Too's burial.The National Assembly Majority leader told Baringo Senator Gideon Moi that the pastoralist community "carried retired Moi on their backs for many years" and that he should do the same for DP William Ruto.He also said he married the daughter of former army chief general Mahmoud Mohammed, whom he claimed saved Moi from the bush during the attempted 1982 coup.Read: Carry Ruto on your back like your father was carried, Duale tells Gideon MoiFormer minister Nicholas Biwott said on Sunday that at the time, &ldquo;Moi was in Kabarak and at no time was he in the bush"."Duale should not use his cheap politics to abuse the retired President. He should know they are not in the same class," said Biwott.He said it was wrong for Duale to imply that Moi was a coward in his own government.Nandi Hills MP Alfred Alfred Keter said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s is disrespectful for Duale to joke around with Moi&rsquo;s name. We demand that he apologise publicly for his irresponsible remarks."The two, who addressed journalists in Eldoret, said the military was to protect Moi as required but that they did not so because of politics.Former envoy Stephen Tarus and Kanu leaders earlier said Duale&rsquo;s remarks were disrespectful to Moi and Kalenjins.&ldquo;Even if Duale knew what happened to Moi in 1982, that was a security issue that did not concern or involve him. It was too irresponsible for him to talk about it in public; he has to withdraw the remarks,&rdquo; said Tarus.He added that Duale, who is also Garissa Town MP, embarrassed two respectable families.

He added that they will ensure the Garissa Town MP does not address meetings in the region.Read: Duale should step aside over terrorism remarks - Nick SalatAlso read: I will write to ICC about Duale, Kalonzo repeats in GarissaMahmoud's family, through his brother Hussein Maalim, asked Duale to stop dragging them into "careless politics".
