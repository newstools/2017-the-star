The Kenya Tea Development Agency wants to invest in the production of orthodox tea to export to Iran and Russia.Orthodox teas are whole leaf teas manufactured using the traditional process.Board chairman Peter Kanyago said the two countries have the biggest markets for the orthodox tea in the world.Once the agency starts manufacturing tea, the market will be good, he said.&ldquo;More than Sh100 million will be used to install the machines. We have ordered the machines and by the end of this year, we are supposed to start manufacturing. We want to ensure that one-third of the tea produced around the country will be orthodox tea,&rdquo; Kanyago said.The chairman said the orthodox tea is more marketable and demanding compared to CTC teas, but it is complicated to process.
