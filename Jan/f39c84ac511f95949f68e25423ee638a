Bright needy students from Butere who scored over 400 marks in the KCPE exam have secured sponsorship from area MP Andrew Toboso. Through Butere NG-CDF bursary chairman James Khabeku, Toboso said 50 students studying locally and in foreign universities have been sponsored since the programme&rsquo;s inception in 2013.&ldquo;Twenty eight of the beneficiaries are studying in China, where we allocate them Sh1.5 million every financial year to cater for their education,&rdquo; Khabeku said. He urged more well-wishers to partner with the NG-CDF committee to educate more needy children.Deputy county commissioner Jack Obuo on Friday praised Toboso, saying the programme takes a heavy load off the chest of needy parents whose children have performed well in national exams.
