The parliamentary committee on Defence will meet today over the Friday terror attack on KDF soldiers at the Kulbiyow army base inside Somalia.National Assembly Defence and Foreign Relations committee vice chairman Barre Shill (pictured) yesterday said the attack &ldquo;caught us by surprise&rdquo;, hence, the need to meet with top army commanders to shed more light.&ldquo;We are meeting tomorrow morning to discuss the issue, which is of national importance,&rdquo; he said.The KDF has said nine soldiers died during the al Shabaab raid on the camp, although other reports indicate 68 died.Saboti MP David Wafula said the committee should release the report on the El Adde attack, which occurred on January 15 last year, before starting an inquiry into Kulbiyow.Wafula, a member of the Defence committee, said the public has been waiting for the El Adde attack report to know what transpired after questioning Chief of Defence Forces Samuel Mwathethe, head of military intelligence Charles Mwai and the Commander of Operations.&ldquo;We summoned the military officials after the El Adde attack and the public need that report. It will be a waste of public funds if we go ahead to probe this attack before clearing with El Adde. We should stop making reports that will never be released,&rdquo; Wafula said.Shill said committee members are at liberty to demand the El Adde report, despite confirming that &ldquo;it has not been concluded&rdquo;.&ldquo;The delayed El Adde report is among issues we are going to discuss, and the committee &ndash; not me or the chairman &mdash; will make the decision,&rdquo; he said. Wafula, however, said the committee should summon military bosses to explain the status of the KDF mission in Somalia in addition to what transpired and the exact number of lives lost during the Friday attack.&ldquo;As a committee, we need to hear from the military leadership if the key mission was indeed accomplished. If it was accomplished why are our soldiers still there?&rdquo; he said.Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka and his Ford Kenya counterpart Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula have called on the government to withdraw Kenyan troops working under Amisom in Somalia.&ldquo;KDF has claimed victory over some key regions occupied by al Shabaab. They have continued to stay there for a very long time. If there is need to stay there, military officials should give reasons because Kenyans need to know,&rdquo; Wafula said.
