President Uhuru Kenyatta's Jubilee Party has dismissed the NASA super coalition as a mirage that will disintegrate much like opposition leader Raila Odinga's Pentagon..Raila (Cord) and Amani's Musalia Mudavadi sealed the deal to form an alliance on December 6, 2016 during a tour of Laikipia county. Other members include Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper) and Moses Wetang'ula (Ford Kenya).Read: Raila, Mudavadi seal super alliance deal to remove Uhuru from powerTheir goal is to have a force strong enough to get the Jubilee Administration out of power on the August 8 general election, but the ruling coalition said its track record speaks for it.In the run up to the 2007 election, Raila assembled what was easily the most potent team in Kenya&rsquo;s electoral history- the Pentagon.It was made up of a star-studded team of politicians representing most of Kenya&rsquo;s regions. They included Musalia Mudavadi, William Ruto, Joe Nyaga and Najib Balala. Charity Ngilu joined them later completing a team of six influential politicians.NASA is expected to include Kanu chairman Gideon Moi and secretary general Nick Salat. But Uhuru phoned Gideon and advised him against the super coalition.Read: Uhuru phones Gideon to stay away from NASAAlso read: NASA is a tribal outfit, says UhuruKilifi North MP Gideon Mung'aro added to Uhuru's criticism saying: "Just like Pentagon failed to capture power, so will Nasa."Mung'aro also said there was no difference between Nasa and Pentagon, as most of the proponents will abandon it.He further criticised the opposition for engaging in retrogressive politics.Read: 'Power hungry' NASA leaders have no agenda for Kenyans - UhuruUhuru boasted about his government's allocation of large amounts of money to Coast counties, Mombasa in particular, but said some leaders were keen on discrediting this."Over Sh600 million has been used to build this foot bridge. Foot paths and slums at the Coast will be upgraded at a cost of Sh3.2 billion," he said.He and several politicians addressed Mombasa residents after officially opening the Buxton foot bridge on Thursday.Uhuru bashed Governor Hassan Joho's administration for failing to allocate stalls to Kongowea traders after the national government upgraded the market.The government pumped Sh444 million into the completion of the retail centre's construction.The President asked Deputy Governor Hazel Katana to ensure traders are not frustrated."People are complaining over stalls. They must be given to them. You take up the matter," he told Katana.Uhuru said the opposition has been good at propagating tribal and religious politics to divide Kenyans.He said tourism has slumped at the Coast due to politics of division."We are not fighting the opposition but they have to ensure their politics doesn't hurt tourism," he said.Tourism almost came to its knees after the 2007/8 post-election violence.
