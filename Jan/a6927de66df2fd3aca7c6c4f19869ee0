Elders from the Lamu's Boni minority community in Pandanguo village have rejected the move by the government to post an &lsquo;outsider&rsquo; as chief.They said the government has picked a chief from a different community and wanted to impose him on them.The elders claimed the government is trying to play smart with them having previously accepted the candidate they had picked for the job.They said Said Bwanambele, who was approved for the job in June last year, is yet to begin work.The elders said his place has been taken by a man, who the elders say is unknown to them, since he belongs to a different community.They said the Boni community has been marginalised for decades and many of their leaders have been handpicked for them without consultation or involvement.&ldquo;We will not allow them to continue picking people and imposing them on us. We have a right to choose and in this case, we have already picked a suitable candidate,&rdquo; elder Adan Golja said.They have urged Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery to intervene.They also said the current assistant chief has neglected them.&ldquo;The assistant chief doesn&rsquo;t stay here but in Witu. He rarely comes here. Most matters that require his attention have no one to attend to. We need people from our own community, people who understand our problems and who are willing to stay and help us not stranger who only care about the salary and the goodies that come with being a chief or an assistant chief for that matter,&rdquo;said Golja.
