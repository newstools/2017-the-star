Former National Police Service champion Philip Kipchumba becomes the 20th top ranked full-bore target shooter in Kenya after gaining promotion following the first circuit of the 2017 calendar.The Directorate of Criminal Investigations officer has been admitted to the Super X (SX) shooting rank, up from X following his consistent excellent performances for Class X of trigger pullers. Kipchumba&rsquo;s journey to the top cr&egrave;me of marksmanship begun 14 years ago at the now shut down Stoney Athi range in Mavoko, Machakos County. His formative years in the sport were rough, at least mentally. Kipchumba had to endure seven tough years competing as a novice &lsquo;Tyro,&rsquo; and six as in the X Class.The police corporal blew hot and cold at the range in the 2003 and 2004 season before he got serious and dedicated to the sport in 2005. After seven years as beginner, Kipchumba moved up to the Class O in 2009.The investigator intimated that the seven years were agonising for him but after five years of shooting as a &lsquo;Tyro&rsquo; he chose to be excited about the game. &ldquo;I felt discouraged by the length of time I had competed as a Tyro. Some of the trigger pullers, who I begun shooting with had already been promoted after four years. However, my shooting age group was so encouraging and inspired me to soldier on,&rdquo; intimated Kipchumba, the 2015 National Police Service overall shooting winner.From 2009, he graced the &lsquo;O&rsquo; category for six years till 2015 when he qualified for promotion to Class X. His good times begun after his first shoot of Class X, where he came third (X3). He then made it a custom to appear in the score board as the winner or second best in the X Class and his persistent paid off in the end.
