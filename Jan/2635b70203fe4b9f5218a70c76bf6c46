New IEBC commissioners will be in office by Wednesday to oversee the countrywide mass voter registration.Justice and Legal Affairs Committee chairman Samuel Chepkong&rsquo;a yesterday said the new bosses will play key roles in voter listing.The month-long exercise starts on Monday, with the commission targeting six million voters. &ldquo;We hope the commissioners, if approved by the National Assembly, will take office,&rdquo; Chepkong&rsquo;a said, as the committee wound up approval hearings for the IEBC commissioners. The committee yesterday vetted former Kenya Ambassador to Russia Paul Kurgat, Kiswahili academician Margaret Wanjala and Egerton University don Abdi Guliye as it concluded its hearings.Kurgat is from Kamagut village in Uasin Gishu county. He told the committee he is not related to DP William Ruto, who comes from neighbouring Sugoi village. &ldquo;After I was recalled as ambassador, I went to my village and sat under a tree to start my life. When I was appointed ambassador in 2010, Ruto was not Deputy President,&rdquo; Kurgat said. The former seminary dropout said he has never taken or given a bribe and he has developed his career through hard work and honesty.&ldquo;Those small extras put people&rsquo;s names in trouble. If you go into the books for being corrupt, your children may want to change their surnames,&rdquo; he said. Asked why he left seminary, Kurgat said his father compelled him to leave &ldquo;because as first-born, I was supposed to sire children&rdquo;.Guliye supported a full electronic voting system, saying it will restore confidence in poll management. MPs asked why he wanted the job that could ruin a distinguished academic career. They cited sensitivity of the task and allegations of past corruption. &ldquo;I have reached the peak of my career. I want more challenging work. I have been more in university management and I have the relevant experience required,&rdquo; Guliye said.
