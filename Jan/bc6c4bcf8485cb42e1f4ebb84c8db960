After his professional stint ended with South African top flight side Ajax Cape Town, midfielder Victor Ali Abondo is not ruling out a return to Gor .Abondo, who left the Kenyan Premier League for the Premier Soccer League of South Africa six months ago, was reported to have parted ways with Ajax on &ldquo;mutual consent&rdquo; earlier last week. Abondo said on the PL official site that his stay in Cape Town was not what he had anticipated and returning to K&rsquo;Ogalo was a possibility. &ldquo;We are still discussing things with my employers and my agent will let me know soon what my next move will be.&ldquo;I like this club (Ajax) but my stay here wasn&rsquo;t exactly what I had hoped for and if they are saying those things (in the media), then there is a possibility that I may leave before my contract is up.&ldquo;If that happens, I would not mind coming back to Gor Mahia. That has been my club for a long time and it won&rsquo;t be the first time I will be returning,&rdquo; he said.Abondo, who had a brilliant 2015 season with Gor but failed to flourish under new coach Marcelo Ferreira the following season, opted for the South African outfit in April 2016 much to the dismay of the Green Army.His return, though uncertain, cannot be ruled out, as Gor would certainly be keen to re-engage with a player of such quality, who stood out playing in the famous green jersey of the record Kenyan championship winners.
