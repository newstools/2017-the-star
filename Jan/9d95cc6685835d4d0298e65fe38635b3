Texas Cancer Centre, which runs two facilities in Nairobi, will open its third one in Eldoret town in February.TCC opened two centres in the capital six years ago, with the goal of lessening the burden on patients who almost always have to travel abroad.CEO Catherine Nyongesa said the Eldoret branch will keep patients from Western from going all the way to Nairobi to get services.The Eldoret centre is located in the Grand Prix Building on Nandi Road. The services that will be offered include linear accelerator radiotherapy, chemotherapy, radioactive iodine treatment, cancer screening and physiotherapy."Our aim is to take our services closer to the people," Nyongesa said. "We also hope to reach out to as many people as possible in other areas of the country in the near future."Texas Cancer Centre CEO Dr. Catherine Nyongesa. Nyongesa further noted that the facility will create jobs for many in Uasin Gishu county.This comes amid the struggle for a compromise between doctors and the government on a strike that is in its second month.Many critically ill patients have been transferred to private facilities as doctors have refused to return to work without better terms.They rejected a 40 per cent salary increase offer by the government that would have seen minimum salaries for doctors raised from Sh140,244 to Sh196,989.Health workers in some parts of the country have said patients suffering most as the strike progresses are those with gun injuries, kidney disorders, cancer, diabetes and fractures.Workers put up a signboard for Texas Cancer Centre in Eldoret town.Read: State blames KMPDU for 'unfortunate' doctors strikeThe launch of the Beth Mugo Cancer Foundation in October last year was hailed as among the positive steps that the country has taken towards tackling the disease.Working with Roche Pharmaceutical Company, the foundation will train oncologists, improve diagnosis of the disease and make cancer drugs available.First Lady Margaret Kenyatta said on Monday that there is need to change the current cancer narrative from a &lsquo;death sentence&rsquo; to a message of triumph and hope.[VIDEO] Boost for war on cancer after launch of Beth Mugo Cancer FoundationAlso read: Kenya to acquire vital equipment to aid fight against cancer, First Lady told
