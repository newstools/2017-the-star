Wiper national chairman David Musila has said that no one except God will make him drop his bid for Kitui governor. &ldquo;I want to put the record straight over talk that I have abandoned my governor quest after Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka prevailed upon me. Nothing is further from the truth,&rdquo; he said on Saturday during a funeral at Mboru village on the outskirts of Mwingi town. Musila said Kitui residents have not asked him to drop his bid. &ldquo;I am fully prepared to be your governor and end plunder at the county government. I will also restore justice in the county administration, which is non-existent,&rdquo; the senator said. He criticised the county Maendeleo ya Wanawake Organisation chairperson Ruth Mulandi and coordinator of Kitui professionals Campbell Munyambu who were quoted in the press on Saturday asking him to bow out of the race. Musila accused the two of being emissaries of Governor Julius Malombe.
