The owner of a Sh2 billion tourist resort in Watamu intends to acquire a Sh200 million charter plane to fly guests from Europe to the hotel beginning next month.This follows complaints by tourists visiting the Temple Point Resort that they experience delays in getting to the hotel from Moi international Airport, Mombasa.Temple Point general manager Ravi Rohra said charter flights will reduce hours spent on the road and give their clients ample time to enjoy their holidays.In an interview with journalists at the hotel on Sunday, he said plans are at an advanced stage and he was waiting for the director, who is out of the country, to return and complete pending work, to pave the way for the flights.&ldquo;In Europe, clients are willing to come to Watamu but they are inconvenienced because there is no connection flight from Nairobi. Sometimes they are forced to wait for over five hours. In Mombasa, road trips are also a big problem due to traffic jam,&rdquo; he said.Rohra said bad roads cause unnecessary delays for the tourists and eat into one day of their holiday programme, adding visitors spend the day resting in the hotel due to fatigue. He said a flight from Europe may take fewer hours than the journey from the airport to the hotel. &ldquo;Our clients say Kenya is a beautiful country, hotels are good but it lacks proper infrastructure to make their journeys smooth,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said.The manager said the 12-passenger charter will ensure clients arrive at the hotel in good time.He asked the national government to speed up the construction of the Malindi International Airport to enable direct flights from Europe to the resort city, saying it will boost tourism.Rohra said upon completion of the airport, the hoteliers are willing to partner with the government to expand roads, light them up, and install CCTVs to enhance security and turn the resort city into a 24-hour economy.&ldquo;Currently we are going to India, a new market with potential clients. We shall have an exhibition stand to showcase the beauty of Malindi and Watamu.&rsquo;&rsquo;
