South Korean manufacturers, LG Electronics have provided an exciting boost to SJAK Player of the Month Awards by increasing the size of television sets given to winners from 43 to 49 inches.In addition to providing the bigger screens, the company will also venture into quarterly Community Social Responsibility (CSR) activities in collaboration with recipients of the award to spread football&rsquo;s love from the pitches right into communities. The improvement takes effect in February when top flight SportPesa Premier League (SPL) kicks off across the country and will run throughout the year. This year will see recipients carry home 49 inch sets and pick a charity event within their localities to be supported by LG and its local staff. This is the third year in LG are sponsoring the pioneer monthly football awards.LG&rsquo;s first dalliance with the award came in 2015 when the electronics behemoth offered 42 inch television sets to supplement Sh50,000 provided by betting firm Sportpesa for the monthly winners. LG improved the size of TV sets to 43 inches last season as the purse also increased to Sh100,000.The fusion of charity into football brings to the fore humane values the game is intended to propagate. Moses Marji, LG marketing general manager expressed his delight with the progress and noted that his company is happy to be associated. &ldquo;We are keen on the CSR aspect as much as the awards because the community is very important.&rdquo;The awards are driven by Sports Journalists Association of Kenya whose president Chris Mbaisi lauded the passion and commitment shown by corporations like LG in supporting sports in the country. &ldquo;We have seen the excitement in our league grow with these monthly awards and it is due to generosity of supportive companies like LG,&rdquo; he noted.
