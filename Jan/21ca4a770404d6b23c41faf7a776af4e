Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula and his brigade oppose the installation of ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi as Luhya spokesman because it threatens to eclipse them, analysts have said.Political analyst Amukowa Anangwe yesterday said Wetang&rsquo;ula, Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale and former Lugari MP Cyrus Jirongo will be the main casualties of Mudavadi&rsquo;s crowning. That is, unless they unconditionally submit and join his bandwagon.&ldquo;The general upshot of all this is that Mudavadi must climb down from a pedestal likely to cause him more problems with his fellow Luhya leaders. Instead, he should promote collective leadership underpinned by dialogue and mutual respect,&rdquo; he said.Wetang&rsquo;ula and Khalwale have been opposed to Mudavadi&rsquo;s elevation and have waged a campaign to discredit him as a Jubilee project. The Luhya Elders&rsquo; Forum has also opposed the installation, saying it will further divide the community, not unite it. Media analyst Martin Andati said Wetang&rsquo;ula feels Mudavadi&rsquo;s elevation gives him more clout in the fight to control the Western vote bloc. He said Khalwale is scared of Mudavadi being the spokesman, because he is close to Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya, whom he wants to unseat.&ldquo;This is simply a supremacy battle and not necessarily about community interests. Khalwale knows Mudavadi, with whom he disagreed in UDF, could complicate matters for him as the regional kingpin,&rdquo; Andati said.Vihiga and Kakamega MCAs have accepted Mudavadi as their spokesman. They are led by Ben Ombima, Alex Khamasi and Cleophas Malala. &ldquo;The Mudavadi factor has complicated matters for Wetang&rsquo;ula in NASA, given that his own home turf of Bungoma trooped to JP a year ago. Wetang&rsquo;ula and Khalwale are bitter with him, because his reunion with Cord leader Raila Odinga has displaced them from the opposition matrix,&rdquo; Khamasi said.
