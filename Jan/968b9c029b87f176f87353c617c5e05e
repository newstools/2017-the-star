More than 200 Siaya business transporter traders yesterday barricaded a road leading to Governor Cornel Rasanga&rsquo;s office. They were protesting against the increased levy imposed on them by the county government. The new charges include Sh300 parking fees for lorries and Sh100 for pickups. Officials said the county has no designated parking spots and they operate under trees. Rasanga, who reports to work at 6am on Mondays for morning prayers and in the company of bishops, boycotted the exercise, eliciting more anxiety among the protestors and the county staff. They waved twigs and placards and chanted anti-Rasanga slogans. The protestors blocked the governor&rsquo;s office entrance, demanding that he addresses them. By the time of going to press, Rasanga (pictured) who was scheduled to be picked from his Segere rural home to address the crowd had not arrived.
