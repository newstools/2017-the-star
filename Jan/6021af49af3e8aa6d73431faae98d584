The Nairobi government has issued show cause letters to the 124 doctors taking part in the ongoing nationwide strike. It has given them until Friday to respond or be sacked. Governor Evans Kidero yesterday said the doctors joined the strike, despite talks with the county government and a court order barring them from engaging in any strike. The doctors were not paid their December salary.&ldquo;Why pay someone for a job they have not done. We will not pay them and we will by Friday sack them and employ other doctors,&rdquo; Kidero said. Last month, county secretary Robert Ayisi said his office is engaging the Health department and the county public service board to hire new medics if the strike persists. Ayisi said the county resolved all the issues the doctors raised in their last strike, which they called off in November. &ldquo;Honestly, we don&rsquo;t know why our doctors are on strike. We paid them for six months and promoted them,&rdquo; he said.
