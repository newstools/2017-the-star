The Mijikenda are used by leaders from other communities in Mombasa to help them clinch political posts, when they should be ruling as they are the majority, Anania Mwaboza has said.He said there is a plan to divide the Mijikenda so they do not enjoy the fruits of devolution.Mwaboza, Deputy President William Ruto&rsquo;s adviser, said devolution was meant to ensure natives manage their own resources.He does not want the Mijikenda to settle for the deputy governor position.&ldquo;If you go to Northeastern, they will tell you Mombasa is for the Giriama. In Nyamira, you will get [Governor John] Nyagarama. The same is replicated in other regions. Why are we in Mombasa being given only ceremonial posts [such as deputy governor]?&rdquo; Mwaboza said on Saturday.He is a Giriama, one of the nine tribes that make up the Mijikenda.Mwaboza said the Giriama is the dominant community in Mombasa and should be holding the majority positions of power.Mwaboza said the Mijikenda should unite and select one leader just as ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi was installed the Luhya spokesman.Mombasa Deputy Governor Hazel Katana is a Mijikenda.Reports say Jubilee governor aspirant Suleiman Shahbal looks likely to settle for Beatrice Gambo, a Mijikenda, as his deputy governor, while Nyali MP Hezron Awiti is seeking a Mijikenda native as his deputy, with Ibrahim Kai touted to be picked.The Shahbal camp deny Gambo will be his running mate. The Awiti camp says a decision has not been made but his running mate will be a Mijikenda.
