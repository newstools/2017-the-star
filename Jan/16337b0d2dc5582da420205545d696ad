They are only majoring to intimidate ad harass governors with summons," he said.Ranguma said devolution will only succeed if the Senate is focused on championing and protecting the devolved system of governance.&ldquo;We cannot even understand what the senate stands for in the devolved system because they have been continuously engaging in witch-hunts,&rdquo; he said.Ranguma, who appeared before the Senate last year over alleged mismanagement public funds, said it was losing its mandate.&ldquo;I have been a victim of witch hunt by the senate and I have always responded sufficiently to the alleged accusations that have been leveled against me," the Governor said.More on this: Senate orders Ranguma to refund cash used in 'wasteful air travel'Ranguma appeared before the Senate in June 2016 over the Sh13 million that his administration had borrowed to facilitate foreign trips by MCAs.He maintained that all the allegations that have been raised him have been baseless and untrue."The work of Kisumu Senator Anyang Nyong&rsquo;o has always been to ensure that I am summoned to the senate.
