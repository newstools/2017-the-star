The Meteorological Department in Kitui yesterday predicted the county and the rest of Ukamabani will suffer 80 per cent crop failure because of low rain and drought.In October it warned of worsening drought and urged planting of hardy crops.The crop failure statement comes as county National Drought Management Authority coordinator Francis Koma on Wednesday said thousands of people face starvation.&ldquo;We issued an advisory so residents could plant drought-resistant crops. Many people face food shortage because they ignored us and planted the wrong crops,&rdquo; Met officer Stanley Mulei said on Thursday. He said the next rains are likely to be inadequate as well. Maize and beans are withering in the field.Unless rains unexpectedly return, expect 80 per cent crop failure. Mulei said.
