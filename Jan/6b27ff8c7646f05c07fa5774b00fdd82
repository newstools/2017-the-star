The government is going to spend Sh9.2 billion in three months to mitigate effects of drought after failure of the short rains season, Devolution CS Kiunjuri has said.The monies will be spent between February and April on phase two of the drought mitigation programme.While addressing a press conference on Thursday, Kiunjuri said the drought, which is worsening in the country, has adversely affected 11 counties with the highest prevalence at the Coast region."Coast region is currently experiencing severe drought. The situation has put the livestock industry at risk and is mainly attributed to the below average rainfall experienced towards the end of 2016," he said. The CS said the government has distributed Sh824 million worth of food aid to drought hit areas and would spread the same to other areas through county governments."Since August 2016, Devolution ministry has released Sh180 million to 15 counties to deal with drought effects. We have also dispatched Sh30 million to county commissioners for conflict resolution in these times," Kiunjuri said.The CS further stated that the government has what it takes to tackle the drought situation and shall ensure that the necessary help reaches the most needy persons on time.Water Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa, who was with Kiunjuri at the press conference, said the state will continue to distribute food to the affected regions in a bid to ensure that no lives are lost due to hunger. This comes as the The National Drought Management Authority (NDMA) warned that depressed short rains across all counties in December will lead to a drought situation last experienced in 2011.

In 2011, the East African region was hit by what the UN reported as the worst drought in 60 years, affecting 13 million people in parts of Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia. Kenya in December secured a Sh11 billion finance deal from the 28-member European Union towards food security and drought mitigation programmes.Read: Kenya secures Sh11 billion from EU for food security, drought
