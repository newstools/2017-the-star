The now-defunct tribunal that investigated the alleged Sh200 million bribe allegations about former Supreme Court judge Philip Tunoi poked holes into an affidavit that contained the claims.In a secret report to President Uhuru Kenyatta, it questioned most of journalist Geoffrey Kiplagat&rsquo;s (pictured) claims.In his affidavit, Kiplagat said businessman Mike Njeru, who was said to be a go-between, had initiated communication in May 2014 asking him to contact Tunoi to assist Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero in his then pending election petition.Njeru also allegedly asked Kiplagat to organise a meeting between Justice Tunoi and &ldquo;Kidero&rsquo;s people&rdquo;.Kiplagat said Njeru was seeking to help Kidero, who is cited in the report as an acquittance, with the election petition filed by Kabete MP Ferdinand Waititu, who lost to him in the March 4, 2013, poll.Njeru told the tribunal that he knew Governor Kidero and his personal assistant John Osogo, who were also at the centre of the alleged bribery scandal, the affidavit says.There were other instances in Kiplagat&rsquo;s affidavit that Njeru is said to have contacted him over the matter.&ldquo;The evidence before the tribunal showed that there was communication between Njeru and Kiplagat. The Safaricom data however showed that Kiplagat is the one who initiated communication,&rdquo; the report says.It says there were no voice calls recorded as alleged by Kiplagat, though evidence confirmed the text messages communication from Njeru to Kiplagat.&ldquo;While Njeru confirmed the communication, he denied the meaning attached to it by Kiplagat. He denied calling Kiplagat to ask for support in the petition involving Dr Kidero. Kidero also denied requesting Njeru to get in touch with Kiplagat for whatever reason,&rdquo; the report says.Njeru said he had contacts in the media industry and had known Kiplagat, who worked for Kass FM, from 2005.Regarding communication between Kiplagat and lawyer Katwa Kigen, the tribunal concluded that the evidence contradicts Kiplagat&rsquo;s allegations.Kigen told the tribunal he knew Kiplagat and had interacted with him as he defended former journalist Joshua Sang at the ICC.Regarding meetings alleged by Kiplagat in his affidavit, the report says that most of the adduced evidence could not ascertain the claims.
