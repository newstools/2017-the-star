Plans to reconcile rival Jubilee leaders in Embu hit a snag when a compromise over interim officials fell apart on Thursday.Two factions &mdash; one led by Senator Lenny Kivuti and the other by Governor Martin Wambora, Runyenjes MP Cecily Mbarire and Manyatta MP John Muchiri &mdash; have been fighting publicly and internally after an abortive election on December 13 last year.The election of officials at Kangaru High School ended in a disarray after supporters of both sides exchanged blows. Each faction presented a list of 19 interim party officials.The officials allied to Wambora and Mbarire took over the leadership on December 22 last year, claiming to have been confirmed by the national headquarters. Kivuti&rsquo;s faction has been demanding fresh elections.On Wednesday, however, the national headquarters decided to merge officials from the two sides by picking some from each side. They settled for chairman John Ndong&rsquo;ong&rsquo;i, an ally of Kivuti, and secretary general Johnston Nyagah who is allied to Wambora and Mbarire.The chairman of the merged combined group called all new officials to a press conference at Izaak Walton Inn on Thursday so they could take over operations, but those allied to Wambora boycotted the event.On Wednesday, Mbarire, Wambora and Muchiri, during a meeting at Owoods Annex Hotel, said they do not recognise the new officials. They accused Kivuti of wanting to control the party affairs single-handedly.The new team, however, said it had taken over and would start mobilising people for party registration. It said that on Monday they will move to the JP office in Embu town.The new team said they were sanctioned by national party secretariat chairman Raphael Tuju and would start campaigning for President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto&rsquo;s reelection.Officials and members have asked leaders to put aside differences to strengthen the party.During the Embu JP election on December 13 last year, the poll venue turned into a battle field and disrupted the election and the 19 officials were not officially named.The factions&rsquo; supporters fought and abused each other.
