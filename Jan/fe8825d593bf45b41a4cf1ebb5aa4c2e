Parliament has approved advocate Wafula Chebukati as the IEBC chairman in a hotly contested debate.MPs also approved for appointment Kibiwot Kurgat, Boya Molu and Abdi Guliye as members of the commission.Others approved are Roselyn Kwamboka, Margaret Wanjala and Nkatha Bucha.The MPs had earlier on endorsed Chebukati, saying the Legal Affairs Committee during the vetting found Chebukati qualified for the job as proposed by President Uhuru Kenyatta.But a heated debate was generated in the National Assembly over his appointment as some MP claimed he did not fit for the job after a petition was raised questioning his integrity.Kajiado Central MP Elija Memusi said it was unfair for Chebukati who came second in vetting to be given the top job and that he would not deliver a credible election."This house should not be blackmailed over the time frame of the elections. I followed the interviews keenly and if I were to score, Chebukati would come second." he said.More on this: MPs &lsquo;ignored&rsquo; petitions against IEBC nomineesRead: Chebukati, Nkatha integrity questions not raised during vetting, says IEBC panelBut Majority Leader Aden Duale dismissed questions on Chebukati's integrity.He also cautioned MPs against creating ethnic animosity over Chebukati's appointment.He said it was not fair for some of them to oppose Chebukati's appointment because he does not come from their regions."The law we passed is very clear that the selection panel will submit two names to the president without specifying gender, region or marks. If you did not have an opportunity to talk to president because your person was not picked, then it is a sad day in this country," he said.Duale said Chebukati had 30 years experience in law practicing and was in order for him to get the chance to serve.He said with a proper support, Chebukati's team would manage even the 2022 election.Also read: I have not met Raila since 2007, Chebukati tells vetting panelHe said, "My advice to Chebukati and his team you should not be blackmailed, intimidated and coerced by any political entity or individual".He appealed to the entire commission to develop a common team work to manage the forthcoming elections."The lives of 40 million Kenyans will be on his hands, he must be a man of God, have the courage, must be firm, committed and very decisive in whatever decision centered on teamwork," he said.Duale's sentiments were backed by minority chief whip Jakoyo Midowo who said if the commissioners were not approved, timelines would not allow for another vetting procedure to be carried out.
