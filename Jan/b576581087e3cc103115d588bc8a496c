The biggest music mentor-ship and competition is up and has been on for two weeks now on Kiss TV. In case you have missed it, you better look out for it every Sunday from 8 PM.Now, this is what is just amazing about this talent search. It has seemingly discovered those quiet heroes, whom we would have never known about otherwise.I am talking about Pedo Brian. He wears this quiet, un-assuming look clothed in thick dreadlocks and hidden under heavy glasses.But it is his confession that's got everybody talking. Hear it in his own words:&ldquo;&ldquo;I've always been a song writer but I was never much of a singer. I worked with bands but the lead singers always forgot about the people in the background once they made it a little. Last year I wrote the theme song for UNDP for the New York UN Summit and other people took the credit for it. That's when I decided how hard can it be and started focusing on singing since I know I can always count on myself.&rdquo;So you can imagine the crop of contestants already in the house! You got to see them for yourself!Pedo must be too humble, because he says that winning the one million bob may change his life, but again no!&ldquo;It has not always been about the money for me. Over the past year I've been volunteering as a music teacher, making sure under-privileged kids have access to music classes and being a mentor for them. That's where my money would go towards.&rdquo;Weeh! These are the kind of role models and influence that this Kenya needs.Do you want to see Pedo win in #TheSearch?You can actually play a part in that!
