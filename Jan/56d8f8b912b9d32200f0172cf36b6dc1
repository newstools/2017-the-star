Kanu leaders in Rift Valley yesterday demanded an apology from National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale &ldquo;for disrespecting retired President Daniel Moi and his family&rdquo;.Led by nominated Senator Zipporah Kittony, they said Duale&rsquo;s remarks demanding Moi&rsquo;s family back Deputy President William Ruto&rsquo;s presidential ambitions were uncalled for.Duale spoke on Monday at the funeral of former assistant minister in the Office of the President Mark Too. He criticised Baringo Senator Gideon Moi for refusing to back Ruto, yet &ldquo;we carried your father on our backs&rdquo; during his 24-year Kanu regime.&ldquo;Now it is your turn to carry DP Ruto on your back,&rdquo; Duale told Gideon. Kittony said the utterances have angered Kanu leaders and supporters in Rift Valley and across the nation.&ldquo;President Moi served the country diligently and his leadership promoted peace and unity. We ask Duale to have respect, otherwise his statements can cause violence,&rdquo; Kittony said.She said Duale has upset them and the Moi family after claiming his father-in-law Gene Mohammed helped Moi during the failed 1982 coup.Kittony urged Duale to stop meddling in Rift Valley politics, purporting to teach residents who to support and vote for. She was with Kanu leaders David Sitienei, Yusuf Chepkwale, Shadrack Busienei and Simon Rotich.
