Five youth have walked from Nairobi to Murang&rsquo;a county to raise money to support needy students&rsquo; secondary education.The youth walked 100km from Nairobi to Mugoiri in five days to raise awareness on the high number of students missing education due to financial constraints. They aim to raise Sh1 million.Led by Sammy Kaihuri, the youth, who work with Breath Ministries that preaches in secondary schools, said they encountered overwhelming cases of needy students that needed financial assistance.Kaihuri, who pioneered the walk, said the idea came to him in 2012 when his neighbour, a form two student, stayed at home for a term after being chased from school over fees. He said unlike other scholarships, the money they raise will cater for all needy cases regardless of their academic performance.
