Teachers in Marakwet have said they will not risk their lives by going back to work. They want security restored first. Deadly clashes have persisted in the area since March last year.Schools reopen today for first term. Knut Marakwet secretary John Cheberi yesterday said there are at least 600 teachers working in 40 schools.The warning comes after a series of night attacks in which two people were killed and two motorcycles stolen in the last week of 2016.&ldquo;How will teachers travel to schools when criminals are targeting travellers in the entire area? Any teacher who will go to school will be doing so at their own risk,&rdquo; Cheberi said.He told journalists in Kapsowar, Marakwet West, that the frequent attacks have made the area uninhabitable for teachers and pupils. &ldquo;We urge parents not to send their children to schools since teachers will not be available until calm is restored,&rdquo; Cheberi said.A school watchman was shot dead by suspected Pokot bandits at Liter Secondary School during the December holidays. Elgeyo Marakwet county commissioner Fredrick Ndambuki said at the weekend a special security team has been formed to tackle night attacks.&ldquo;We are sending a warning to crooks and criminals who seem to have changed their pattern of crime into operating at night that their days are numbered,&rdquo; he said. At least 30 people have reportedly been shot dead in cross-border attacks and inter-clan skirmishes that have persisted, despite intervention by the National Cohesion and Integration Commission. Local authorities have warned of a humanitarian crisis as the attacks that began in Endo ward extend to Sambirir, Arror and Kapyego wards. Mon location chief Benedict Chebii said on Sunday residents have fled to the safer Kerio escarpments for fear of reprisals.
