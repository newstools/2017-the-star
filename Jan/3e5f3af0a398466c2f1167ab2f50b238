The High Court has ordered the status quo be maintained over the contested Sh198 million contract to provide security services at the judiciary. Justice George Odunga (pictured) on Friday issued orders in favour of Bedrock Security Services Ltd to remain within judiciary premises.The firm sued the judiciary chief registrar as the first respondent and Lavington Security as the second respondent.Odunga also directed that the Public Procurement Administrative Review Board be served with the orders.Bedrock Security petitioned the board two days after the contested award, saying the judiciary unfairly locked out other bidders. It wrote a protest letter to Chief Justice David Maraga&rsquo;s office and Director of Public Prosecutions Keriako Tobiko.The firm cited glaring omissions in awarding the multimillion-shilling tender for provision of security services to the judiciary in favour of a firm that did not indicate the bidder&rsquo;s price during evaluation.In a correspondence to Maraga backed by a sworn affidavit, five top judiciary officers are implicated in the alleged tendering scam. It is unclear how members of the evaluation committee came up with the Sh198 million figure, although Lavington Security omitted the bid cost.The award letter was signed by Peter Mulwa, registrar magistrate&rsquo;s court, on behalf of judiciary registrar Anne Amadi on December 28, but the letter indicates December 23. However, through an affidavit drawn by Njuguna and Partners Advocates, Bedrock Ltd managing director protested, citing procedural flaws and professional misconduct in the whole process.
