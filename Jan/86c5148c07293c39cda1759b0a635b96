The fact that the 2016 basketball season spilled over to this year is reason enough for the Kenya Basketball Federation to rethink a new approach to their fixtures management and the structure of the event.The race for the 2016 title resume January 14 with women&rsquo;s semi finals with the men&rsquo;s event already pitting Kenya Ports Authority and Co-operative Bank in the final.While the bankers were tops in the standings, the porters on the other hand had to battle hard in the last two games to finally make the play-offs. Co-op were top in the regular season.In the semi finals, KPA topped reigning champions Ulinzi Warriors splitting a game in Mombasa before taking two in Nairobi for a 3-1 series win. Co-op shut out Thunder also on a 3-1 victory. On their way up, the two finalists also shook off Equity Bank and United States International University (USIU).In the ladies category, unbeaten KPA raced up 2-0 against Co-op Bank to hold a firm grip in the first semi-finals played in Nairobi and they only need to win one game when the series moves to Mombasa to make the finals.The other semi final match pitting reigning champions USIU against Equity Bank &lsquo;Hawks&rsquo; did not take off. This eagerly awaited duel was cancelled as the students were engaged in the regional varsity games at the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture Technology; Juja campus.The league was spread over five tiers thus Premier League, men&rsquo;s Division One and Two and women&rsquo;s Division One&mdash;perhaps the reason for the stretched programme.It has been along and winding road that has seen a total of 56 teams battling for honours across all cadres of the leagues. As the KBF struggles to close the league in the new year, the Nairobi Basketball Association successfully wrapped up their programmes with self supporting teams Neosasa Morans and Footprints taking the men and women&rsquo;s title respectively.At the international level, USIU and KPA carried the nations flag to the Fiba Africa Zone Five Club Championships in Dar-es-salaam, Tanzania, where they won gold and silver respectively.
