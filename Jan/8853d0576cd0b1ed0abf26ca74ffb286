A court has issued an arrest warrant against Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists&rsquo; Union officials.They are secretary general Ouma Oluga, chairman Samuel Oroko, treasurer Daisy Korir and deputy secretary general Mwachonda Chibandzi. Other officals are Allan Ochanji, Titus Ondoro and Evelyne Chege.Employment and Labour Relations Court judge Hellen Wasilwa issued the arrest order after the officials failed to appear in court as directed. The judge was to pass judgment on the officials for disobeying a court order that stopped the ongoing doctors&rsquo; strike.&ldquo;In the absence of the contemptors, a warrant of arrest is inevitable,&rdquo; Wasilwa said. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do anything else other than to issue a warrant of arrest against them. If they don&rsquo;t want to come to court, let the officers arrest them and bring them before me.&rdquo;She directed the Kilimani Police Station OCS to enforce the order.However, KMPDU Nairobi branch secretary general Thuranira Kaugiria yesterday told striking doctors that Oluga and Oroko were &ldquo;being hidden somewhere in Nairobi&rdquo; and will be produced in court tomorrow.&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll then apply for bail on Friday so they can continue with negotiations. We didn&rsquo;t want them in court today because they would have been arrested in an uncouth manner and taken to prison,&rdquo; he said at the Railway Club, Nairobi.Korir, Mwachonda and Chege appeared at yesterday&rsquo;s meeting briefly then vanished. About 3,500 doctors working in public health facilities are taking part in the strike, which today enters Day 38.The counties, which employ 80 per cent of the doctors, said they will issue disciplinary letters to those who do not resume work today and sack them after one week.The medics yesterday resolved they will not collect the show cause and dismissal letters. They said they will not negotiate with the counties.&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the most talented people in Kenya, you have the brains and you shouldn&rsquo;t be apologetic,&rdquo; Korir told members.The striking doctors have twice rejected salary increment offers and new allowances by the government. The last offer by the President raised the monthly pay of an intern from Sh126,000 to Sh197,000.
