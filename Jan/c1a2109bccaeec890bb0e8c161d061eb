Lamu residents have asked the state to employ trained teachers from the area to handle lessons at some five schools that were closed over terror attacks in 2015.They said that they cannot keep with their children being at home or having to trek long distances for classes just because teachers have declined to take up jobs in the area.The group, drawn from among the minority Boni community at Basuba ward, said they have many qualified youths from the area who can teach at the said schools without fear.Gurba Ali, the parents representative, said it was high time the state reopened the schools, having said that the area was free from further threats."We have people who have trained as teachers and they can work here without any fear. Education is stagnating and there is need to save it," Gurba said.Teachers posted to Basuba, Milimani, Mangai, Mararani and Kiangwe primary schools are reported to have declined the offer citing fear of al Shabaab attacks.The schools remained closed as others across the country resumed first term classes on Wednesday, a situation the parents said was unacceptable.Read: Schools in Lamu remain shut over insecurityAlso read: Insecurity, poverty blamed for education crisis in Lamu "We have information that those who were posted here don't want to come.
