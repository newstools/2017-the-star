Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho was allegedly detained at Mombasa CID headquarters after visiting a relative arrested earlier on Friday.County director of communications Richard Chacha said the Governor was blocked from leaving the station since he went there at midday.Chacha said the relative Joho visited was arrested when officers raided and ransacked his home, amid a security withdrawal saga."The officers told him he also had to stay at the police station," Chacha said, adding there was no further communication.Joho went to the station with Mvita MP Abdulswamad Nassir, who is also reportedly being held there.Sources said the Governor went to find out why his relative, only identified as Haroub, was arrested but refused to leave.He was allegedly detained for causing a disturbance.Read: Joho&rsquo;s relatives, friends homes raided, ransacked by policeArea OCPD Lucas Ogara told the Star he was not aware the two had been detained."I left my office a few minutes ago. I am not aware of such an incident. Maybe it is at the DCIO's office. I am following on the matter," he said.The officer neither commented on whether Joho and Nassir were under arrest nor spoke of any possible charges.Police IG Joseph Boinnet told the media Joho and the two MPs were not detained but were at the police station, demanding release of a suspect.But Joho's lawyer Mohamed Balala said the politicians might spend the night at different stations."Orders were issued that the governor and the rest should not leave and should be brought clothes, indicating they were to stay here long," he said.Earlier in the day, police also raided the business of Mombasa county inspectorate director Naheed Musa, 30, a licensed gun dealer.Musa said the heavy police presence was a routine inspection.&ldquo;This inspection has come at the wrong time because of too much speculation out there. This thing is very normal,&rdquo; he said.Musa said the officers arrived at his firearms store in Nyali at 10 am to conduct regular inspection which is done four times annually.Officers also detained MPs Rashid Bedzimba (Kisauni) and Suleiman Dori (Msambweni), as well as several MCAs.
