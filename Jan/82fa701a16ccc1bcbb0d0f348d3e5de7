Sports Cabinet Secretary Hassan Wario could be out of office by next week as the file for his prosecution for the Rio Olympics Fiasco is almost ready.Wario will be the seventh minister to leave President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s Cabinet for alleged corruption or abuse of office since he entered office in 2013.Director of Public Prosecutions Keriako Tobiko yesterday told the Star he expects the file from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations on Thursday.&ldquo;I gave them 14 days from January 12 and they have made significant progress. The DCI has put together a team of investigators to strengthen the investigations on the gaps that I had asked be addressed,&rdquo; he said.This comes just days after Uhuru asked Wario to carry his own cross over the matter when they met in Isiolo over the weekend.Wario is said to have tried to use the opportunity to have leaders from the area discuss the issue with the President. However, the President told them to allow investigators to complete the job, something that he repeated on Sunday during a press conference at the Sagana State Lodge.&ldquo;We&rsquo;re waiting for due process to be done. A report has been done and the investigating authorities are doing their work. We will take action when the process is complete,&rdquo; Uhuru said.Uhuru expected to actHe has previously not hesitated to fire his CSs and Principal Secretaries who have allegedly been linked to impropriety.In 2015, Charity Ngilu (Lands), Felix Koskei (Agriculture), Davis Chirchir (Energy), Kazungu Kambi (Labour) and Michael Kamau (Transport) were suspended and later replaced after eight months for alleged involvement in corruption and misuse of powers.Former Devolution CS Anne Waiguru later resigned on health grounds due to the NYS scandal. She was linked to the scam. She said a constant onslaught from critics had taken a toll on her health. Uhuru handed over the Rio Probe report, which sought to investigate allegations of a possible loss of Sh100 million, to the DPP last year.In his review of the report, Tobiko recommended the prosecution of Wario, Sports PS Richard Ekai, ministry director of Administration Haron Komen and Nock officials over payment of allowances to athletes.Tobiko told the DCI the probe had established that the officials abused office and ordered further investigations.&ldquo;The ministry incurred an extra expense of Sh6.6 million to cater for an extra six people in the Rio delegation,&rdquo; Tobiko said.He said Wario chaired a steering committee that oversaw the signing for money that exceeded salaries and remuneration guidelines.Another Sh59.153 million was lost on irregular payments on tickets procured by Ekai and Komen.Athletes and Central Management officials were given extra allowances totalling more than Sh15 million, exceeding the Salaries and Remuneration Commission ceiling.payments to unnamed personsThe DPP said investigations should also be conducted to establish why unnamed officials, who did not travel to Rio, were paid allowances.About Sh16 million was lost on payments to these unnamed people.In August last year, Wario disbanded the National Olympics Committee of Kenya and exonerated himself from the woes that befell Team Kenya. &ldquo;I transfer its responsibilities to Sports Kenya as the interim custodian,&rdquo; he said.Wario blamed Nock members for failing to execute their mandate in line with the Sports Act and accused them of grossly violating the privileges accorded to them.The move saw MPs gang up to table a motion to remove him. It never went through.Uhuru then assured Kenyans that once the inquiry into what really transpired in Rio was complete, those implicated would be individually held accountable.PS cried foulIn November last year, Ekai accused the Rio Probe Committee of a witch-hunt, claiming his role in the steering committee was misrepresented.He said the report quotes him as the chairman of the steering committee, which he disputes, saying his boss, Wario, was the chairman and terming the report malicious.&ldquo;I was baffled by reports that I was the chairman of the Local Steering Committee. This was the role held by the CS and I was only acting on his behalf whenever he was absent or had to leave meetings earlier than planned,&rdquo; Ekai said.&ldquo;To this effect, all the other members of the committee had appointment letters from the CS, but I never had one.&rdquo;He also expressed concern over the manner in which the report was being &lsquo;hidden&rsquo; from him, despite being a key member of the planning team at the ministry.&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen the report. I&rsquo;m just trying to piece together the details as reported in the media,&rdquo; Ekai said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in government for long and I&rsquo;ve never seen a situation where a report comes here and I&rsquo;m not aware of it.&rdquo;
