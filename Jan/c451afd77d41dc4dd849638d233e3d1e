Businesspeople, motorists and pedestrians have complained about the invasion of parking spaces and pavements by hawkers in the CBD.The traders have erected tents on parking lots on Moi Avenue, near Kenya Cinema, and around Kencom and at the Kenya National Archives.&ldquo;These people have invaded the entire area, there is no place to park our cars. Walking is a problem. This is total mess and the county should act,&rdquo; motorist Tom Mbugua said.But a trader told the Star they have licences from City Hall to operate there.Trade executive Anne Othoro yesterday said, however, they are operating illegally, as they had been ordered to leave.&ldquo;They went to court last year and obtained an order that barred us from interfering with them,&rdquo; she said on the phone.Othoro said the traders were ordered to leave the streets in December and warned that those who defy the order will be forced to vacate by the county enforcement officers.
