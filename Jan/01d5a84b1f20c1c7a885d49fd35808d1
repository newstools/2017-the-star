MPs from the drought stricken North Rift counties yesterday expressed fears that many lives could be lost and schools shut down if the national and county governments don&rsquo;t move with speed to contain the crisis.The seven lawmakers from Baringo, Turkana and West Pokot counties piled pressure on President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s administration to declare the raging hunger a national disaster to allow immediate intervention to save livestock and human lives.Tiaty MP Asman Kamama, who led his colleagues at a press conference in Parliament Building, urged the government to give starving residents cash to buy food on their own, besides supplying relief food.&ldquo;The hunger situation is so bad that people are already feeding on wild fruits, which shouldn&rsquo;t be the case in this age. The government should use the contingency and emergency funds to resolve the problem,&rdquo; Kamama said.He was accompanied by Samuel Moroto (Kapenguria), William Cheptumo (Baringo North), Grace Kiptui (Baringo woman representative), Protus Akujah (Loima) and Christopher Nakuleu (Turkana North).&ldquo;People will start dying in the next one month because of the persistent drought. We ask the government to ensure no one dies of hunger. The Devolution CS should use another system of providing food. The government should deploy water tankers for residents and schools,&rdquo; Kamama said. He appealed to the donor community to come to the rescue of the suffering residents.Cheptumo said three wards &mdash; Saimo Soi, Barweza and Bartabwa in his constituency &mdash; are the worst hit. He added, &ldquo;This should be addressed now to save our people. The government is responsible for guaranteeing food security. There should be fairness in food distribution.&rdquo; Cheptumo urged the government to build dams.
