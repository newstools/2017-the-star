Deputy President William Ruto completed his 10-day holiday at his Sugoi home in Eldoret, where he focused on strengthening Jubilee Party, especially in Rift Valley, ahead of the August polls.He met with some of the interim county officials elected in polls that most members said were unfair.&ldquo;You must focus on building a strong and united Jubilee Party and as officials you have to remain non partisan in how you lead,&rdquo; the DP said.He told the officials he is happy that residents are committed to Jubilee and that those still doubting would soon join the camp. &ldquo;As officials you must help us consolidate our unity and ensure we win the elections,&rdquo; he said when he hosted delegations from across the country.He hosted delegations from almost all counties in Rift Valley and others from Central and Western Kenya.The DP was keen on groups from his home, whom he urged to ignore Kanu and Chama Cha Mashinani headed by Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto because their main intent is to cause divisions within the Kalenjin community.Among the interim party officials present were those from Uasin Gishu led by chairman William Mutai, secretary general Christopher Mitei and organising secretary Victor Bitok.&ldquo;We have been given a task by members of Jubilee Party as interim officials and we would like to assure them that we will market the party without any bias and work with all members,&rdquo; Mutai said.They will also coordinate vigorous campaigns to ensure youth and other residents register in large numbers to prepare for the polls.&ldquo;There are many ID cards still uncollected in registration offices and we want to ensure they are picked to enable residents enlist as voters and participate in the August elections,&rdquo; Bitok said.The DP used the meetings to get to know various individuals who will be vying for seats and assure all party members that the nominations would be free and fair. &ldquo;Every aspirant will be given an opportunity to exercise their democratic right and we will not have any preferred candidates,&rdquo; he said.It&rsquo;s estimated that the DP hosted more than 30,000 people at his home during his stay in Turbo.
