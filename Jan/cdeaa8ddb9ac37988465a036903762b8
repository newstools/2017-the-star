They should be serious," he said.The secretary general asked members of the union to remain firm and await further instructions from them.Muga K&rsquo;olale, Universities Academic Staff Union secretary general, accused VCs of public universities of sabotaging negotiations demanded by Education CS Fred Matiang&rsquo;i.Matiang&rsquo;i asked the Inter Public University Councils Consultative Forum and the unions &ndash; Uasu, Kusu and Kudheiha &ndash; to fast-track the talks.
