Five siblings from Mtongwe have received aid from the Bridge International Academies and Reach the Star initiative. Marithia, Mwanamvua, Mwahamisi, Somoya and Mkasi Saidi dropped out of school more than three years ago. The initiative is led by Miss World Africa Evelyn Njambi. Njambi, who came fifth in the Miss World pageant, said she was touched by their plight and decided to help them get back to school. She said with the help of Bridge academies, her aim is to ensure quality education is accessible to everyone, especially girls. The academies&rsquo; communication officer, Jackline Walumbe, said the girls&rsquo; education is fully catered for. &ldquo;We admitted the girls after their plight was brought to our attention by one of our teachers in Mtongwe,&rdquo; Walumbe said.
