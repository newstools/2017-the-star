Kandara MP Alice Wahome has said she will mobilise MPs to shoot down the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Amendment) that seeks to reduce the consensual sex age from 18 to 16 years.Speaking at Ruchu during a meeting with Ng&rsquo;araria and Ithiru ward residents on Monday, she said no way right-minded MPs will pass the controversial law that will put children at risk of being sexually abused.&ldquo;The law is so contradictory that it even wants children to acquire IDs at the age of 16. It also contradicts the marriage law that says no person below 18 years is allowed to marry. We won&rsquo;t allow the laws to be passed,&rdquo; Wahome said.She said 16-year-olds are still in their early stages of secondary school education and allowing them to have consensual sex would put their education at risk.Wahome said MPs must support girls by rejecting the laws.&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to have incidents where girls are dropping out of school due to early marriages or pregnancies. Whoever introduced the law was out of their mind and we won&rsquo;t allow it to see the light of day,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t allow my daughter to get married at the age of 21 because there&rsquo;s so much she doesn&rsquo;t know about marriage. Introducing 16-year-old children to illicit sex is moving backwards as a country.&rdquo; Resident Mary Njeri said Kenya has more problems that need the state's attention.&ldquo;I wonder what the person who introduced the laws wanted because 16-year-olds are still children who know little about the dangers of early sex,&rdquo; she said.The law recognises persons below 18 years as children, making it a criminal offence to anyone who engages in sexual activities with children. Residents urged MPs to reject the amendment, which has already gone through the first reading, saying it is an impediment to the country&rsquo;s efforts to deal with problems that affect girls, such as female genital mutilation.Read: Law proposes reduction of consensual sex age from 18 to 16
