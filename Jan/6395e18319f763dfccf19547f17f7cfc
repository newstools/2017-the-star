Devolution Cabinet Secretary Mwangi Kiunjuri and nominated MP Sarak Lekorere have trashed the opposition's calls for investigations into the 2016 KCSE results.They defended Education CS Fred Matiang'i saying he has tried his best to bring back sanity to the sector and the opposition was only playing politics.This is after ODM leader Raila Odinga joined calls for investigations into the exam results and questioned the mass failure.Kenya National Union of Teachers also took issue with how the marking was done and whether it was a show of credibility in the exams.But Kiunjuri and Lekorere questioned why Raila does not see anything positive with the Jubilee administration even when all other sectors have appreciated the work done."Kenyans are happy with with how Matiang'i handled the whole examination issue and there is no turning back," Kiunjuri said.Lekorere said the formation of a commission to investigate the results is intended to derail the government's efforts in working with other departments and sectors headed by Matiang'i. The two were speaking during a Sunday service at PCEA church in Nanyuki town.The 2016 KSCE results have drawn strong reactions after only 141 out of more than 500,000 candidates registered scored straight A grades.A majority of candidates scored below C+, which is the cut off grade for admission into public universities.Knut secretary general Wilson Sossion said the union had identified clear breaches in the marking process that were overlooked by Knec and Matiang'i.Also read: KCSE 2016: Candidate disputes 'B' grade, says more time needed to mark examsIn an interview last Friday, Sossion said Knut was in the process of seeking Parliament's intervention in its quest to have the exam results cancelled.He said the union established, through a probe, that examiners deployed to administer and mark the exams were convinced beyond doubt that due process was not followed in marking and releasing the exams."We launched our own investigations as a union and we have consulted widely and we have come to the conclusion that these results are not a true reflection of candidates' performance," he said.More on this: KCSE 2016 results: Over 183,200 candidates to miss university slots after scoring 'D-', 'E'Read: KOT crack jokes about Matiang'i after early release of KCSE 2016 results
