Life is like a river. We have falls and rocks but we must flow. I was born in a teacher&rsquo;s household which had very strict rules. As a family we have always been taught to be God-fearing. I have been brought up well especially in regards to my roles as a man. I would say so because I am focused in all my undertakings and I always know what comes first and what comes last. Music has been my passion, as I started listening to it since back when records were the main medium to tapes to CDs. God has always been my way because without him, nothing would ever happen.0530HRSI wake up, pray then prepare breakfast. I then do the dishes from the previous meal, shower and set set off for my classes.1100hrsMy classes are usually done by around this time. I head out to the DJ academy, where I sharpen my skills. Practice makes perfect. Here I also get to find out and listen to new music that has been released. 1400HRSI do graphics and design, which is kind of my side hustle. I get to be creative and create posters and banners. I get a lot of clients, so most of my weekday afternoons are focused on completion of different projects.1800HRSI head home. Sometimes I have shows on Fridays, where I deejay for parties and other events. I also get club bookings. As a disc jockey for a dance club, I am responsible for playing songs that are both entertaining and will engage the audience. This may include playing requested songs as well as setting up selections that will make the audience enjoy their stay there. The effect is that is pushes the audience to visit the vicinity more and more, increasing the venue&rsquo;s clientele.
