Police officers are the top perpetrators of bribery offences, facing charges for soliciting as little as Sh150 after bargaining, a recent EACC report indicates.The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission quarterly report for July to September 2016 tabled in Parliament on Tuesday shows that 14 out of 17 graft files under prosecution involve officers accused of taking bribes.EACC forwarded 33 files to DPP Keriako Tobiko, but 10 files were closed for lack of evidence while one was recommended for administrative action.The report shows that the amount officers solicit depend on the services sought, offence committed and region, particularly its financial potential.For instance, a police constable at the Huduma Centre within Garissa Town faces charges of receiving Sh150 after he solicited Sh200 to issue a police abstract, which is given free.A police corporal at Ruaraka police station is facing the charge of receiving Sh1,000 after vainly soliciting for Sh2,000 from a complainant to release his employee from custody. EACC in its investigations established that the corporal asked the complainant to pay the money through another person to conceal his direct involvement.An officer commanding the Dadaab police division is facing the charge of receiving Sh17,000 after he solicited Sh20,000 to stop the impounding of public service vehicles operating within Haghadere, Garissa county.The report says a Criminal Investigation officer attached to the Bungoma Flying Squad Division is facing charges of pocketing Sh25,000 bribe after he solicited Sh45,000 to release an impounded car.Civilians caught offering bribes are not left to walk scot-free.A drunk motorist is facing charges of offering Sh1,000 bribe to an officer attached to the National Transport and Safety Authority while manning a roadblock along Mombasa Road at Makutano Junction. He did not want to be subjected to a breathalyser test to gauge the alcohol content in his body.
