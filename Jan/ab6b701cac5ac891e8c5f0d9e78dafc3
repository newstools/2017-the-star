The Ministry of Lands is working with the Directorate of Criminal Investigations and EACC to prevent fraudulent transactions at Ardhi House.Cabinet Secretary Jacob Kaimenyi said on Friday that there have been meetings with the DCI's land fraud unit on strategies of dealing with land fraudsters."I can comfortably reveal that we have plain-clothed police at the land registry at the moment," Kaimenyi said in statement on Friday.He added that the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission was in September last year invited to conduct a systems audit of processes and procedures at the ministry."This was with a view to identifying weaknesses and suggesting solutions on how to seal the said weaknesses," Kaimenyi said.The development is likely to deal with cases where one parcel of land has multiple titles or claims of ownership.The CS said EACC's audit will be completed by end of May and will improve the ministry's tracking of files to avert losses."As you all know, loss of files and documents has been a serious source of concern to a sizable number of our customers," he said. Kaimenyi said plans are at an advanced stage to launch a task force to investigate the processing and renewal of leases for the last six years. The committee will include land management experts from universities, representatives of the Law Society of Kenya among other stakeholders.The taskforce will be involved in finding out whether due process was carried out, the people who signed, registered and issued the said leases irregularly.The committee is expected to give recommendations on how to prevent fraudulent processing and renewal of leases.The ministry also expects the taskforce to recommend actions to be taken against all those individuals who have been involved in fraudulent renewal of leases.In April last year, Kaimenyi dissolved all the Land Control Boards.He said the committees formed in 2009 had overstayed in office becoming conduits of graft dealings in Lands offices.The CS said the members of the committees had been in office for too long leading to allegations of being occasionally compromised in discharging their duties.Read: Sh370 Million lost in SGR land fraud dealsAlso read: Land fraud rampant in Kisumu, says Ranguma
