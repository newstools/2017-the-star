The government yesterday dismissed claims there is a plot to assassinate Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho.Early this week, the governor accused the state of planning to assassinate him, his supporters and some opposition leaders.Joho said he kicked out state-provided security officers because they had been sent to &ldquo;plant illegal substances&rdquo; and guns at his home and later incriminate him.The governor said this would have made it easy to frame and arrest him, forcing his supporters to pour into the streets to demand justice.But county commissioner Evans Achoki (pictured) on Wednesday said the government has no plans to silence Jubilee critics. Joho made the claim during the launch of voter registration in Treasury Square on Monday.Achoki said the governor should make a formal complaint to the police. &ldquo;The government&rsquo;s priority is not to plan how to execute politicians, but to ensure all citizens and their property are safeguarded,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;If there is a leader who feels there is a threat to his life, the law requires them to report the matter to the nearest police station for investigations.&rdquo;At least four APs assigned to guard Joho&rsquo;s former residence were chased away. The officers were recalled and redeployed.Joho also denied involvement in drug trafficking.He said the government is building a narrative to suit its agenda, adding that his relatives and friends have been frustrated by security officials.Joho said he is going through a tough time for being a Jubilee administration critic.
