Gatundu South MP has started a TV talk show aimed at in depth analysis of issues that have received limited coverage in the mainstream media.The first episode of the show aired last night on Facebook and YouTube. Kuria said he wants to start a digital channel called ASAP TV.&ldquo;We have realised there are things that need to be discussed in detail and communicate them in languages that the people understand best. This is because the media has reported some of these issues in a shallow manner or in a sensational manner,&rdquo; Kuria said.He added, &ldquo;The first episodes are in the Kikuyu, but you will see others in Luo, Kalenjin, Luhya and other languages in the coming weeks. This is not a political show. It has nothing to do with Jubilee or Cord.&rdquo;Kuria also said other than politics and current affairs, the show will discuss business and consumer matters.
