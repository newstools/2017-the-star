In the course of every Kenyan presidency, there comes a time when His Excellency faces a perfect storm of chaotic problems of all kinds.This seems to be one such time for President Uhuru Kenyatta.First there is the doctors' strike, which really should have been resolved by now, but is only gathering steam as the doctors refuse to compromise.Then the staff of the public universities are also now setting the stage for a strike of their own.The effects of a major drought seem to be escalating to the point where we may soon have images of Kenyans who have died of starvation.And on the political front, a newly energised opposition has taken the first crucial steps towards creating a formidable coalition which will pose a real challenge to his reelection prospects.This is a great deal for any one man to have to tackle all at the same time.But then, the Kenyan presidency has never been a walk in the park.
