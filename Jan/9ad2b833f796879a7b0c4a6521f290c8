Hundreds of pastoralists from Garissa county have started moving with their animals in search of water and pasture.This migration towards Tana River and Lamu has sparked fears of conflict, even long before the pastoralists and their herds descend on settled farming communities.A not dissimilar migration of herders and their herds has wrecked multi-million-dollar conservancies in Laikipia and wreaked terror in Kitui.One herder points to possibly corrupt too-little-too-late official interventions when he tells the Star that he has yet to see any government official make him an offer to buy his weakened animals in the Sh18,000 per head scheme.Enrolment in schools has declined so dramatically education officials have devised mobile schools that follow the pastoralists wherever they go.It is deplorable that such a massive lack of disaster preparedness in the face of a drought that was foreseen at least a year ago should have overtaken the national government and communities across county borders in this despicable manner.
