Pastoralists in drought-stricken areas have been put on high alert over tsetse fly infestation. Kenya Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Eradication Council CEO Pamela Olet said the remaining grazing areas in Lamu, Kwale and Isiolo counties are likely to be the most affected.&ldquo;These are the areas where animals are now converging in search of pasture and they are heavily infested with tsetse flies,&rdquo; she said. Olet said the county governments should assist pastoralists in spraying their animals to reduce the density of the flies and spread of trypanosomiasis.&ldquo;It has been observed that forested, shade areas and water points are the places tsetse flies migrate to during drought, when humidity is low. This increases the biting rate of the flies on the herd and sustained infections in the localised areas,&rdquo; she said on Saturday during a media briefing.
