A Murang&rsquo;a resident has written to speaker Leonard Nduati opposing a plan to shift Sh800 million from development to recurrent expenditure, saying it was done unprocedurally.Governor Mwangi Wairia and 17 MCAs met on January 21 in Naivasha and agreed in a memorandum to move money.Kangari MCA Anderson Waweru said the memorandum was a last resort as the county waits for more funds from the National Treasury.&ldquo;Last year we passed a budget of Sh5.8 billion but we have not received the whole amount and so we have to use what we have to cater for the needs of our people,&rdquo; he said.But resident Peter Muturi said the memorandum is delicate and should involve public participation to maintain accountability and transparency.&ldquo;The memorandum is a violation of the law as the governor cites regulation 37 of the Public Finance Management Regulations and section 131 as the basis for the proposed amendments, yet these sections relate to the annual estimates to the budget, hence, they are not applicable to the current proposed amendments,&rdquo; the letter says.Muturi asked the speaker not to approve the motion until the legal challenges are settled.Debating the amendments will be a violation of the law as the public has not been involved in the &ldquo;hurried and unprocedural amendment&rdquo;, he said.&ldquo;The budget amendments to the budget point at a scheme by the county executive to divert funds from development projects to recurrent expenditure for the sake of pilferage of public coffers to possibly finance their political activities,&rdquo; the letter says.
