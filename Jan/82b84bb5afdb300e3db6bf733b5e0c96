We are facing a constant struggle with the empowerment of the girl child in the world we live in today. Mostly, this plight is coming from the female voice, bashing the male with a dialogue against patriarchy. The origins of this issue traces back to the values imparted by parents from the childhood of the girl child; at least, that is what the activist&rsquo;s voice says. Wushu is a traditional martial arts form. In the documentary India&rsquo;s Wushu Warrior Girl, a girls&rsquo; school in the rural areas of India teaches Wushu to the girl child for self-defence. In a beautiful narrative, we follow the story of a strong girl child in the name of the protagonist. BATTLING TABOOSThe biggest misconception in the debate of the empowerment of the girl child is that the male voice is hindering the progress of young girls the most. This is not exactly the right manner to view this problem.Here, we have a girl child who has become so great at the martial art form that the school has picked her to represent the city in the national championships, for which she has to travel. This is where her battle begins. Her mother has refused to let her travel because a girl isn&rsquo;t supposed to step out of the house, and it&rsquo;s shameless for a Muslim female to show her face in public. Her brother agrees with the mother.This would seem like a brutal end to the girl&rsquo;s dream. However, there is a silver lining somewhere. FATHER TO THE RESCUEHer father, a strong male presence and voice stood up for his daughter against his wife and son. He told them, she needs to be independent to make her own decisions as a strong girl and woman. This story reaches an emotional midpoint as the father sees her daughter stepping into the real world, as he drops her to the train station for the national championships.
