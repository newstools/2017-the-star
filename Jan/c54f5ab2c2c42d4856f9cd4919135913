Transport Cabinet Secretary James Macharia and PS Irungu Nyakera yesterday defended the Sh327 billion standard gauge railway from Mombasa to Nairobi.They also defended the value of the locomotives imported from China, saying they are among the world&rsquo;s best. Kenyans have been complaining that the Jubilee government gave them a raw deal in the SGR project.There are complaints the cost of the project was highly exaggerated, while the locomotives are second-hand from China.But speaking when he received the first six locomotives in Mombasa, Macharia and Nyakera called politicians opposing the project &ldquo;naysayers&rdquo;.&ldquo;This project is 18 months ahead of schedule and we want to tell politicians opposing it we have actually delivered. The project knows no borders and cuts across 17 counties from Mombasa to Malaba, in which lives of millions of Kenyans will be transformed,&rdquo; Macharia said.He said President Uhuru Kenyatta is expected to officially launch the SGR operations on May 31. Present during the function were Charg&eacute; d&rsquo; Affaires Yao Ming from the Chinese Embassy in Kenya, Kenya Railways Corporation Board officials and top officials from the China Roads and Bridge Corporation.&ldquo;The Mombasa-Nairobi SGR has registered a remarkable construction speed and we expect completion of the entire project soon, and within our contract terms. The delivery of this first batch of freight locomotives is a major milestone on this journey,&rdquo; Macharia said.He said four of the locomotives are the main model used in the Chinese railway system, with a power of 3100KW and a maximum speed of 100km/h.Once the SGR is operational, this locomotive will be the main force serving freight transportation needs on the entire railway.The other two are DF7G shunting locomotives with 1550KW power, which together with the freight locomotives will be used for moving dispatching locomotives and rolling stock within stations.Macharia said 56 locomotives manufactured by CRRC Corporation will operate on the Mombasa-Nairobi SGR route.The entire fleet is expected to be in the country by mid-year in four batches.
