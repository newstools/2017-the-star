Cord is divided on calls for the reinstatement of governors Amason Kingi (Kilifi) and Hassan Joho&rsquo;s (Mombasa) security detail.Some have called for street protests and ultimatums to be issued to the state, while others say residents should provide alternative protection.The National Executive Council will meet on Wednesday to decide the way forward.The last time the two governors had their security detail withdrawn, and Joho&rsquo;s firearm licence revoked, Cord sued. The High Court dismissed chief licensing officer Samuel Kimaru&rsquo;s decision to revoke Joho&rsquo;s firearm licence. Joho and Kingi&rsquo;s security detail was recalled following last year&rsquo;s Malindi by-election. The state also briefly shut Joho&rsquo;s business premises.Sources have said the NEC will consider suing the state because &ldquo;it is the governors&rsquo; constitutional right to be guarded.&rdquo;Msambweni MP Suleiman Dori retracted his two-day ultimatum for the governors&rsquo; security detail to be reinstated.His Kisauni counterpart Rashid Bedzimba said the electorate should guard the leaders, whether the state reinstates the security or not.University of Nairobi political analyst Philip Kaulu yesterday said the withdrawal was politically instigated.&ldquo;It is aimed at intimidating them from opening the lid on mega scams facing the government,&rdquo; he said.Kaulu said there could be more problems for the two governors if they continue to attack the presidency.&ldquo;The state&rsquo;s next course of action against the two will be more severe as the political temperature is set to boil over before August 8. What the leaders should avoid is taking protests to the streets, because it will give the government an opportunity to hammer them completely,&rdquo; he said.Joho and Kingi have been two of the most vocal opposition governors against the government. Kaulu said other opposition governors have attacked the state &ldquo;with caution&rdquo;.
