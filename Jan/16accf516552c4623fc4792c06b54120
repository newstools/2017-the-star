The two had a small wedding attended by only a few family members and friends.Yunita yesterday said, &ldquo;We decided to formalise our marriage so we put things right once and for all.&rdquo; Kibor will be back in court on February 1 for divorce proceedings.Last month, there was drama in an Eldoret court when Josephine wailed during the divorce hearing.Josphine said Kibor was insensitive.&ldquo;Why are you putting me through all this? What have I done to deserve this? I am unwell and can only continue when I get well,&rdquo; she said. But Kibor insisted the case proceed to full hearing.Kibor, a once powerful, Kanu bigwig filed the divorce case after 51 years of marriage to Josphine. The couple got married in 1965. Kibor told senior principal magistrate Charles Obulutsa he wants the case concluded quickly so he can move on. &ldquo;You can see how disrespectful she is. Someone sick cannot make such a loud wail in court. What I want is the divorce and that is it,&rdquo; he said.Kibor filed for divorce last month, accusing Josephine of desertion, cruelty and interfering with his 800 acres in Kipkabus, Uasin Gishu county.He said he has not lived with Josephine for 30 years. &ldquo;She is my wife, but I have not slept in the house I built for her for the last 30 years. She does not respect me and she has abandoned the farm for long, causing the death of my livestock and chickens,&rdquo; Kibor said.Josephine told the court she loves and respects her husband, and does not understand why he filed for divorce.
