The High Court has stopped the lecturers&rsquo; strike that was to start on Monday.Justice Hellen Wasilwa of the Employment and Labour Relations Court stopped the University Academic Staff Union, the Kenya Universities Staff Union and their members from engaging in any activity likely to disrupt operations.&ldquo;An order is hereby issued restraining Uasu, Kusu, their officials, agents or members from taking part in, calling, instigating or inciting others to take part in an unprotected strike or any form of industrial action, pending the hearing and determination of the applications,&rdquo; she said.The lecturers have threatened to down tools if the government does not give them a 300 per cent pay rise. Wasilwa further directed that the two unions be served the order through emails, registered posts or an advertisement in newspapers.She issued the orders following an application by the Inter-Public University Councils Consultative Forum of the Federation of Kenya Employers.It told the court the planned nationwide strike called on December 8 and Friday is unprotected.The unions say the 300 per cent increment they are demanding will equalise their salaries with other lecturers across the world. They want it backdated to July 1, 2013, claiming the government had already agreed to it.The unions are asking for a minimum salary of Sh350,000 for an assistant lecturer in job group 11, and a minimum of Sh1.5 million to a maximum of Sh1.9 million for a full professor.Announcing the strike, the unions said they have done all they can to engage the government over their collective bargaining agreement, but has been no fruit.
