Devolution CS Mwangi Kiunjuri and nominated MP Sarah Lekorere have dismissed the opposition&rsquo;s call for a commission to investigate whether the KCSE results are genuine.They said the government has tried its best to restore sanity to the education sector, but &ldquo;the opposition keeps playing politics.&rdquo;They spoke on Sunday after attending a service at PCEA in Nanyuki town.&ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t opposition leader Raila Odinga see anything positive in the Jubilee administration, even when all other sectors have appreciated the work done?&rdquo; Kiunjuri asked.Raila has called for investigations after Knut questioned how the marking was done. There were only 141 As during last year&rsquo;s KCSE exam, a sharp decline from the 2,685 As in 2015.Kiunjuri said, &ldquo;Kenyans were happy with how my counterpart Fred Matiang&rsquo;i handled the whole examination issue,and there is no turning back.&rdquo; Lekorere said, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to have studied rocket science to see the public is happy with the manner in which the education sector is being reformed.&rdquo;She said the call for the formation of a commission is a scheme to diminish the government&rsquo;s efforts.Kiunjuri hinted he could run for Laikipia governor. He is on record saying he is not interested in any elective post.The CS urged congregants to pray for him as he decides whether or not to resign and run for office.&ldquo;I am consulting the President on the matter,&rdquo; Kiunjuri said.
