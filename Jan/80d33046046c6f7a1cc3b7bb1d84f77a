Airtel Kenya is not among the African units of the parent Bharti Airtel earmarked for sale this year, managing director Adil El Youssefi has said.Bharti Airtel&rsquo;s chairman Sunil Bharti Mittal told Bloomberg News on January 19 that the giant Indian-owned telco was considering mergers and sale of stakes in some of its operations in 15 African countries. The plan, Mittal said, was to make the African business, which it acquired from Kuwait&rsquo;s Zain in 2010 for $9 billion (about Sh935.64 billion), profitable.The plan is part of a strategy to cut Bharti&rsquo;s massive debt, which stood at $12 billion (about Sh1.25 trillion) last September. Bharti&rsquo;s African operations made a loss of $91 million (about Sh9.46 billion) in three months ended September 2016, a 46.47 per cent reduction from $170 million (about Sh17.67 billion) a year earlier.&ldquo;The company remains committed to competing in the Kenyan market and providing choice to Kenyans by further investing in the rollout of 4G services in the next few months, and the continued expansion of its network coverage to ensure consistent delivery of quality and value for money services to its customers,&rdquo; Youssefi said.Airtel is the country&rsquo;s second-largest mobile network provider by coverage, with a market share of 17.5 per cent as of last September after Safaricom which controlled 69 per cent share. The telco announced on January 13 it would lay off 100 staff, bringing the tally to 160 as 60 others were sent home in January 2016.&ldquo;All the steps taken recently with regards to human resources and infrastructure have been geared towards getting ready to grow in the medium to long-term, efficiently and sustainably,&rdquo; Youssefi said.Airtel has in the past accused Safaricom of abusing dominance, prompting the regulator to seek powers to investigate the same.Youssefi on September 8, 2015, said the telco could exit Kenya&rsquo;s market, citing displeasure over the way the Communications Authority of Kenya had dealt with issues it had raised about Safaricom. The company reaffirmed its commitment to Kenya days later. &ldquo;Airtel is likely to exit Kenya if the market structure is not addressed in terms of dominance,&rdquo; Youssefi had said.
