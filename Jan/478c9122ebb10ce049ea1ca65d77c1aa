Bungoma 'moneybags' Moses Nandalwe wants Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang'ula to accept Moses Mudavadi's appointment as the Luhya spokesperson.Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli named Amani leader Mudavadi for the position during a rally at Bukhungu stadium, Kakamega county, on December 31, 2016.Wetang'ula criticised the selection at a rally on the same day.Via Twitter that day, he added: "Listening to Francis Atwoli, you can't help believing what Mukasa Kituyi said about him."Read: Mudavadi announced as Luhya spokesman during Atwoli rallyAlso read: 'Angry' Atwoli hits at Khalwale, Wetang'ula, calls for respect during 'Luhya spokesman' rallyMudavadi was named following a survey conducted by the University of Nairobi Economic Department to identify the strongest and most popular leader in the region sponsored by Atwoli.The research was done between July and October 2016. 2,600 respondents were interviewed.But Nandalwe said his selection did not require confirmation by research as he is the most popular presidential candidate in Western."Mudavadi is most popular based on the number of MPs, senators and governors behind him. Anyone opposing this decision is putting his political future at risk," he told the Star by phone on Monday.He added that Wetangula's failure to accept the community's decision was putting his political future at risk.The rich politician, who will vie for Sirisia MP in next year's election, said all residents and all other politicians, including Cyrus Jirongo, should also respect Atwoli's announcement.Mudavadi emerged the most popular Luhya leader in Western, ahead of Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya and Wetang'ula.Nandalwe said he will hold meetings with aspirants and leaders in Bungoma county to ensure support for Mudavadi, and that President Uhuru Kenyatta's Jubilee Party is removed from power."We have a common enemy. Mudavadi needs support so that when he joins forces with our presidential candidate Raila Odinga, Kalonzo Musyoka, Gideon Moi, Isaac Ruto and Hassan Joho, Jubilee will go home very early," he said.Read: I am the good shepherd, Mudavadi says as Western vote hunt hots upThe politician defended Atwoli saying he has made history since the demise of Kijana Wamalwa and Masinde Muliro."The Luhya community lacked a selfless leader who can use his own resources to put the Luhya community together. Atwoli took the responsibility to join our former heroes, we must respect and congratulate him," he said.Nandalwe added that those "making noise" about not being consulted are lying."Atwoli called them to the table and consulted them. He even facilitated them to mobilise and sell the idea widely. They were later bribed by outsiders to boycott the rally. Unfortunately it was successful," he said.'Moneybags' warned that they will not let Raila work with weak co-principals "as was the case in 2013".He thanked Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya and Lugari MP Ayub Savula for leading efforts to unite Luhyas.
