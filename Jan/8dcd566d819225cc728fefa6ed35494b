The 2015 Africa Cup for Club Champions bronze medallist Niger State Flickers men&rsquo;s hockey team believe the event being staged in Kenya is a sure bet for them to improve their performance.Speaking on Thursday at the City Park Stadium after an afternoon training session the Flickers coach Yohanna Faruk said they were unable to play in the competition the last time Kenya staged the event in 2009 having arrived late.The tactician believes Kenya will give them the perfect stage to improve on their performance.&ldquo;The memory is still clear in my mind. We had trained well in 2009 and we were looking forward to the competition but the worst thing happened as we arrived late. We all know the logistics that come with travelling and let me just say we messed up and arrived in Kenya late and we were not able to compete in the competition,&rdquo; Faruk observed.He added: &ldquo;But that is water under bridge. I&rsquo;m happy we are here now ready for the event,&rdquo;The official, a former Nigeria national team player, said their pool is tough but was quick to note it was also wide open and only the best two teams will qualify for the semi-final.&ldquo;We have good players, some even play for the Nigeria national team so we have our work cut out. The fact we won the Nigeria Hockey league back to back from 2013 should say something about us, but we will not be overconfident as the Club championship is different ball game all together,&rdquo; said Faruk who remembers playing against the now Butali Sugar Warrior coach Cliffe Okello during the 1995 and 1999 All Africa Games.The West Africans who have been drawn in pool &ldquo;B&rdquo; alongside former champions Sharkia, Butali Sugar Warriors and Ghana Police will begin their title hunt against West African counterparts Ghana Police on Sunday in the last match of the day at 7.30pm at the City Park Stadium.
