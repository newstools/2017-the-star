UoN medical students took to the streets on Thursday in protest against disruptions to their studies, caused by a prolonged doctors' strike."Hatuna lecturers, hatutasoma (We do not have lecturers, we will not learn)," they chanted while waving placards calling for doctors' demands to be met.They said they wanted their lecturers back and noted that it was the government's responsibility to ensure doctors offer services at hospitals.The students said they would march to Mbagathi Way where Kenyatta National Hospital is located, Ngong' Road, Upper Hill and then on to Kenyatta Avenue in the CBD."We call on the government, through the concerned ministry, to resolve the stalemate with doctors so that clinical teaching can resume," said Ahmed Dekow, chairman of the Association of Medical Students of the University of Nairobi.Dekow earlier said all of today's classes were suspended. He asked all medical students to show up for the demonstrations carrying lab coats and stethoscopes.At least 20 people have died since doctors went on strike on December 5, 2016, while many have been forced to seek treatment at private facilities which are expensive.Health workers countrywide downed their tools saying it would be the longest in Kenya's history.More on this: Doctors begin 'longest strike in history' over 2013 CBA agreementThe government made them an offer but they turned it down saying they wanted their 2013 Collective Bargaining Agreement fulfilled.They rejected a Sh4 billion offer by President Uhuru Kenyatta, which raised their gross salaries by at least 40 per cent.The 2013 CBA gives them a 300 per cent salary hike, raising the monthly pay of a university intern to Sh325,000.Read: Inside the striking doctors&rsquo; 2013 collective bargaining agreementAlso read: Doctors reject Uhuru&rsquo;s Sh4bn offer as Rotich says decision is painfulLast week, the Labour court gave health workers a "small window" to call off their strike or face a month in jail.Judge Hellen Wasilwa, asked medics to end the strike in two weeks, during which she said negotiations should be taking place.[VIDEO] Court orders doctors' officials to call off strike or face one month jail[VIDEO] KOT takes on judge Hellen Wasilwa for referring to doctors as 'stinking sewage'
