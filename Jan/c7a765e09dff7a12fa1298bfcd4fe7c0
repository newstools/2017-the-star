Kenyan parliamentarians have on many occasions in the past exhibited a propensity for awarding themselves lavish retirement benefits slightly before Parliament dissolves ahead of a general election.These benefits are in the form of hefty bonuses and unjustified perks that are embedded in legislation passed through lengthy negotiations and late-night decisions.In 2007, the Ninth Parliament passed legislation giving each parliamentarian a hefty bonus, bodyguards for life, private chauffeurs and a state funeral.These ridiculous proposals were promptly rejected by President Mwai Kibaki.In 2012, the 10th Parliament passed a Retirement Bill, bestowing upon Members of Parliament illegal incentives in the name of a retirement bonus that included more than Sh10 million per MP plus other perks.It was proposed Kibaki and his predecessor Daniel arap Moi receive cumulative perks of Sh64 million as pension budget, which was a 64 per cent increment from the previous financial year.The amended presidential retirement benefits law additionally gave Kibaki a lump-sum payout of Sh25.2 million, a monthly pension of Sh560,000 and an annual in-patient medical cover of up to Sh21.2 million.Kenyans expressed their anger on these illegal activities by parliamentarians by venting their outrage on social media, including Twitter and Facebook.The implications of this are a heavy burden placed on taxpayers and a biting cash crunch in government to finance these proposals.The legislative amendments are usually introduced late in the night and made public as a fait accompli on the next day.In some instances, there were reports that amendments were made on a piece of paper and signed by the Finance minister.Kenyans need to be vigilant to ensure that rogue parliamentarians do not make any amendments awarding themselves hefty packages just before the expiry of the 11th Parliament. And this needs to happen at both the national and county levels.
