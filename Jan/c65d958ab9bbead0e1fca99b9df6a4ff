Kisii Senator Chris Obure has picked former Ford People national chairman Albert Nyaundi as his running mate in the race for Kisii governor.He said they will campaign together for the Jubilee Party ticket ahead of the August 8 general election.Obure was elected on an ODM ticket but shifted allegiance to President Uhuru Kenyatta.He pointed out that he picked Nyaundi after consulting widely with local leaders."He is, in my view, the perfect choice. This is also in the interest of all the opinion leaders, colleagues and friends that I have consulted," he said.The unveiling of Nyaundi, an architect and Jubilee party operative, has raised stakes in the scramble for the party's ticket.It came days after Kisii Deputy Governor Joash Maangi, initially touted as Obure&rsquo;s running mate, declared his interest in the seat.The senator on Friday dismissed speculations that he had promised to appoint Maangi, a key ally of Deputy President William Ruto, as his running mate."I want to clarify that at no time did I reach an undertaking or promise that Maangi would be my running mate," he said."I have never considered Maangi an appropriate running mate," Obure said, adding the Deputy Governor was working closely with his boss James Ongwae.Read: Hot contest in Kisii Senate race as high-profile candidates line upAlso read: Maangi enters Kisii governor race, unsettles Jubilee plan to beat Ongwae Obure welcomed Maangi&rsquo;s candidature but told a press conference in Parliament that he was confident he would trounce him at the primaries. The Senator, who has been critical of Ongwae's leadership, said he will support whoever wins the nomination."In the remote event that Maangi beats me, I will have no option but to support him,"said the Senator who was elected on an ODM ticket.Obure said he was working with at least seven of the nine MPs from Kisii county in his bid.He said his decision to vie was also informed by massive mismanagement and plundering of public resources by the current administration."We will work tirelessly to entrench Jubilee in the county," he said.Nyaundi, who is putting up a multi-billion shilling avocado factory in his Bomachoge constituency, said his role at the Jubilee headquarters will not influence the primaries."The position of deputy governor is not elective and I don't think that will influence anything," he said."But if it will mean that some people are skeptical of fairness, I will quit my position at the party,"he said.Nyaundi has unsuccessfully contested four times for election as Bomachoge Borabu MP.
