Two Jubilee senators at the Coast are feuding over Sh500,000 donated by Deputy President William Ruto for a greenhouse.They are nominated Senators Emma Mbura and Mshenga Mvita. Women in Kokotoni, Rabai constituency, on Thursday held protests over the alleged theft of the money.Led by Victoria Mishi and Sarah Tsaza, they threatened not to register as voters and accused Mvita of stealing the money. Mvita is eyeing Kilifi woman rep, while Mbura will run for Rabai MP.Mbura said Mvita has refused to hand over the money to 40 women&rsquo;s groups. &ldquo;She has to release the money to be put to good use. Rabai women are suffering. She will undo the work we have done in registering voters,&rdquo; she said at her Rabai home.Ruto donated the money when he commissioned Kamukunji Dam on November 18 last year. The greenhouse would serve 1,200 women.But Mvita said Mbura is trying to hijack the project. &ldquo;I have bought a greenhouse for Sh421,000. I am only waiting for direction from the Rabai women on where the project will be established, because apparently, Senator Mbura does not want it in Rabai,&rdquo; Mvita said at her Vipingo home.
