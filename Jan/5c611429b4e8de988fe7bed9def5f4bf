A number of politicians at the Coast will be investigated for aiding the Mombasa Republican Council. Likoni deputy county commissioner Albert Kimathi on Friday said they are following reports that some politicians are helping the group reorganise.He said they have reason to believe the politicians are affiliating themselves with the group.&ldquo;We cannot release their names as yet although we have all the reports concerning their activities in connection with the MRC,&rdquo; Kimathi said.He said they will take legal action against any politician found aiding MRC activities or harbouring its members.Kimathi said some of the politicians serve in the national and county assemblies, while others are aspirants.He said the politicians may be planning to use the MRC to disrupt the general election on August 8. Kimathi said the MRC is recruiting youths aged 13 to 17. The MRC is recruiting in Likoni,Kisauni and Kwale, which is its stronghold. The MRC was decriminalised by the High court in 2012 and the decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal last year. It, however, has been struggling since the disappearance of its leader Omar Mwamnuadzi. He disappeared from his home and his whereabouts are still unknown. Kimathi said Mwamnuadzi&rsquo;s disappearance has weakened the group due to power struggles among the remaining leaders. Last week,the group requested a meeting with top government officials. In a letter signed by secretary general Nzai Ruwa and addressed to regional coordinator Nelson Marwa, they said peace and security would be the main agenda of the meeting.
