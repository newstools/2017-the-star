Tharaka Nithi Njuri Ncheke elders have warned a rival group led by Linus Kathera against holding meetings in the county.Chairman Jonathan Kang&rsquo;ori said members of the Kathera-led faction are interested in personal gain, instead of residents&rsquo; welfare.&ldquo;We know it&rsquo;s election time. We haven&rsquo;t heard them visit the county before,&rdquo; Kang&rsquo;ori said.&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve heard they&rsquo;re asking for handouts from aspirants so they can campaign for them. We want to warn them against bringing their problems to Tharaka Nithi.&rdquo;The Kang&rsquo;ori faction falls under the umbrella body headed by secretary general Phares Ruteere and chairman Paul M&rsquo;Ithinkia. He said they are the legitimate supreme council of elders to discuss the county&rsquo;s affairs.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the chairman. They can&rsquo;t organise meetings in Tharaka Nithi without my consent,&rdquo; Kang&rsquo;ori said.The elders split in February 2015, after a ceremony in Njuri Ncheke&rsquo;s Ciakariga Shrine in Tharaka constituency was criticised by some Meru leaders. The event was used to lobby support for Senator Kithure Kindiki&rsquo;s bid for Deputy President in 2022 and saw him installed as a Meru elder.The crowning made Kindiki the official spokesperson for the Meru community and charged him with the responsibility of representing theirinterests in the Senate and in government.Kindiki was accorded a ritual preserved for leaders and dressed in traditional regalia made from the skin of a colubus monkey. He was given awalking stick to signify his new status. However, Meru Governor Peter Munya rejected Kindiki&rsquo;s endorsement. M&rsquo;ithinkia, Ruteere and patron Francis Muthaura were present. Efforts to reach Kathera for comment were unsuccessful as his phone wasswitched off.
