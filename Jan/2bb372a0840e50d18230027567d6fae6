A Jubilee faction headed by former Kisauni MP Anania Mwaboza has called for a truce with rival group led by Suleiman Shahbal. Ali Mwatsahu and Fareed Swaleh said they want to sit down with Shahbal&rsquo;s group. Their agenda is to equally share positions of power in the party, after last month&rsquo;s shambolic elections.Shahbal&rsquo;s team won most of the interim positions, including that of chairman, going to Matano Chengo. The Mwaboza team rejected the election results. This comes four days after President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s political adviser Joshua Kuttuny met Shahbal and Fareed. &ldquo;We want the blessings of Mzee [Uhuru], so that we can start campaigning for him,&rdquo; Swaleh said on the phone on Wednesday. Mwatsahu said they are ready to work with the Shahbal faction. Mwatsahu and Swaleh said they want Mwaboza and Shahbal, who both want to run for Mombasa governor, tto face each other in the nominations.
