Turkana leaders have asked the government to conduct a fresh security operation along the border with West Pokot and Baringo East, following the resurgence of banditry.Four people were killed last week, including a Kenya Police Reservist, area chief Henry Ejore, Alfred Lokori and Lochokon Naucher.Leaders say crime is escalating and they fear that banditry may disrupt voter registration and other preparations for the August 8 general election.&ldquo;Our people will fail to register as voters and be denied the opportunity to exercise their democratic rights to choose their leaders,&rdquo; Turkana South MP James Lomenen said.Other leaders are Turkana Deputy Governor Peter Ekai and Turkana North MP Christopher Nakuleu.&ldquo;The IG should order a security operation to ensure that peace is restored,&rdquo; Nakuleu said. He said hundreds of people have fled their homes as a result of banditry.Ekai said the state has not acted firmly on calls to find a lasting solution to the cattle rustling.Lomenen alleged that some politicians are using the stock theft and attacks to achieve their political agenda. &ldquo;There are some leaders in the county allied to the opposition who are against peace and they are the ones inciting youth to engage in cattle rustling,&rdquo; he said without naming anyone.The Catholic Justice and Peace Commission says it is concerned with escalating crime.
