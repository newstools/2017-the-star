MPs yesterday told Anglican Church archbishop (Rtd) Eliud Wabukala to evoke spiritual intervention in the war on graft as they unanimously approved him to chair the anti-corruption agency.The lawmakers appealed to the decorated cleric to shepherd the fight against corruption with prayer and supplication so the country can win the war. Wabukala (pictured) will use his 12-year experience and exposure while heading the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission.National Assembly Majority leader Aden Duale reminded him that the task ahead is monumental and challenging. &ldquo;Where you&rsquo;re going is not the Anglican Church. Neither is the work a religious activity. You must know you are walking into a very dangerous institution, where corruption fights back,&rdquo; he said.The Garissa Township MP said Parliament allocated massive resources to the EACC and the commission has the responsibility to deliver on its mandate.&ldquo;Let him not sit on the chair then other issues come into the fore. The issues that should come should be that he was a man of God,&rdquo; Duale said.He urged Wabukala to use his wisdom and start with prayers to ask for God&rsquo;s help. &ldquo;I hope you won&rsquo;t make us have another motion to debate you.&rdquo;Minority leader Francis Nyenze said following successive failures by former chiefs, who were hounded out of office, it is time the country tried &ldquo;the man of God&rdquo;. He said, &ldquo;All the other people who have been tried, were not leaders in the church. I can see there&rsquo;s an attempt to involve the men of God.&rdquo;
