A 40-year-old farmer from Kirima village in Rurii, Ol Kalou is the latest multimillionaire in town after winning the Sh100 million jackpot in the just concluded Lotto draw.Geoffrey Kung'u, a father of two, said he had been playing lotto until the evening of December 31, 2016 when he received a call informing him that he was the lucky winner.He said since the game began, he has played on a daily basis and spent Sh3,000 in total."For now I'm just coming to my senses. I didn't believe it is true. But now I believe it is real because I have seen the media, security and lotto officials visit our home," he told journalists on Sunday.Kung'u, who draws a monthly income of between Sh5,000 and Sh10,000, said he will consult with his family before deciding on the way forward."I will take a month or more without touching a single coin to make necessary decisions because I don't want to fall to traps like many [previous] lottery winners," he said."God will guide me," he added.His wife, 32-year-old Margaret Wamuyu, said she not believes that lotto is real and urged Kenyans to participate as much as they can "because their life too can change in an instance".Hundreds of residents celebrated with Kung'u and his family, saying they were proud of his win.Many abandoned their activities to participate in the fete where sheep were slaughtered for the big feast.Lotto communications officer Peter Oyier noted that the area is "blessed" since two weeks ago the power draw winner came from nearby.Stanley Ng'ang'a, a retired librarian from the area, won Sh10 million."Somehow it is a very lucky place," Oyier said.He said Kung'u will work with financial advisers and counsellors to help and his family make a wise decision about their future."He is going to be with us for a period of three to four weeks, depending on how he feels," he said.Read: Isiolo housewife bags Sh1 million in Lotto drawAlso read: Four win Sh36 million SportPesa jackpot
