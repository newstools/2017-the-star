The Ministry of Industry and Trade has downplayed concerns that more industries might close down this year and leave many people jobless.&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t expect anybody to shut down. The business environment is good,&rdquo; Industry and Enterprise Development PS Julius Korir said yesterday. He spoke in an interview on the sidelines of the 22nd Session of the FAO/WHO Coordinating Committee for Africa in Nairobi.The World Bank last October ranked Kenya 92nd globally in its Ease of Doing Business Index from 108 previously, citing business reforms initiated by the government.Growth in the manufacturing sector was sluggish in 2016 as industries struggled to cope in a tough business environment characterised by massive layoffs and closure of two factories.Kenya Fluorspar Company laid off hundreds of workers after it began scaling down operations in February last year. The move followed a global slump in fluorspar prices and stiff competition in the sector. Tyre manufacturer Sameer Africa also announced plans to close its Mombasa Road plant last September, a move which will leave hundreds without jobs. The listed firm cited competition from cheap and subsidised tyre imports mainly from China.According to the Kenya Association of Manufacturers, local industries are grappling with high cost of energy at Sh11 per kilowatt hour, compared to Ethiopia, where factories are enjoying lower tariffs of between four and five cents per kilowatt hour.Illicit trade and corruption are also major concerns for the sector. It is estimated that Kenyan manufacturers are losing at least 40 per cent of their market share to counterfeiters, KAM CEO Phyllis Wakiaga said recently, which has &ldquo;unfairly&rdquo; reduced the industry&rsquo;s earnings.This, coupled with frequent power outages, congested industrial zones, high labour input costs, increasing overall production costs and a huge import bill are denying the manufacturing sector an opportunity to thrive, the association pointed out.&ldquo;We currently have a structure that supports imports and not local manufacturing,&rdquo; Wakiaga said in an interview last month.
