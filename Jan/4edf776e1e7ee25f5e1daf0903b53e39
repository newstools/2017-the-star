When the Jubilee Alliance Party passed a resolution to dissolve all its affiliate parties and form one strong outfit, it was all in good faith.But going by history and banning of party hopping in case someone loses at the nominations, this merger comes with a lot of challenges and risks ahead of the general election in AugustParty nominations in this country have never been free and fair. And although the top Jubilee leadership has promised free and fair primaries in April under IEBC supervision, there is still fear and suspicion among some aspirants. They fear that there are already preferred candidates at the expense of democracy.Even without rigging, Kenyans are not known to accept defeat.So whether the nominations will be free and fair or not, some candidates will still cry foul and since they don&rsquo;t have a chance to join other parties, we cannot be sure that they will support the winners or move to the opposition.Worse still is the way their supporters will react, and whether they will turn up to vote for a presidential candidate of a party which locked out their candidate in the primaries.Any dissenting voice after the party primaries is likely to result in a fallout and the victim will be none other than the party&rsquo;s presidential candidate &mdash; Uhuru Kenyatta &mdash; who is expected to face a strong united opposition if NASA unity becomes a reality.In some Jubilee strongholds such as Kiambu and Murang&rsquo;a counties, a big number of voters have transferred their registration centers from their rural constituencies to Nairobi County. This is after being lured by aspirants from their areas who are standing for various seats in the capital city.During the April nominations, these voters have a guarantee of being ferried to the city. But will it happen in August if their candidates fail to make it in the nominations?The answer is simply no. But it could have been different if the candidates were given an opportunity to try their luck in other parties as has been the case in the past. A promise of jobs for losers, which has been fronted by the opposition, is just a promise or could even be a political ploy that might not be easy to turn into a reality. The number of aspirants is huge.Jubilee should therefore rethink the party hopping ban if they want to win in August.A fallout four months to the general election is something any party expecting to win a hotly contested election must avoid. Jubilee should avoid this suicidal move by all means.Maybe despite being condemned for failing to fold her Narc Kenya party, Martha Karua, who comes from a Jubilee stronghold, might be the biggest beneficiary of a possible Jubilee fallout after the primaries.The move will further hurt Jubilee because even if they capture the presidency, they risk not having the Majority in both Houses and also at the county assemblies.Kenya is far from being a first world democracy with two main political parties. And though we are headed there, we still have a lot to do to reach there, a fact Jubilee top leaders should keep in mind.It is not too late to makes any changes that might save President Uhuru and Deputy President William Ruto from going down in history as a one-term government.
