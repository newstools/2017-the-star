The Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists&rsquo; Union has filed an application in court to have their one-month suspended sentence postponed for another two weeks.Its officials were handed a one-month suspended sentence on January 12 by Justice Hellen Wasilwa after they were found guilty of contempt of a court order that directed doctors to resume work. The two-week suspension period was to enable the union and the Health ministry to negotiate and settle the issues surrounding the doctors&rsquo; strike. Doctors want the government to honour the Collective Bargaining Agreement signed in 2013.The judge directed police to arrest the officials and lock them up once the two-week negotiation period elapsed.The new application now places the official&rsquo;s future in limbo. The court is expected to give directions on the application and sentencing of the doctors&rsquo; officials today.Through lawyer Washika Ochima, the officials say they require more time to fully comply with the directives of the court to engage with the Council of Governors and Health CS Cleopa Mailu.They say the sentence has placed them at a clear disadvantage during negotiations.&ldquo;The CoG and the Health CS have used their advantage of the pending sentence to arm-twist and frustrate the negotiations,&rdquo; they say.The officials are of the view that an extended negotiation period will result in an amicable solution to the health sector impasse. They want the court to review the sentence orders.The union also wants the court to issue orders directing the officials be released on favourable bail terms to ensure their attendance in court.The documents say they have complied with the directions of the court on engaging with the CoG and Mailu towards resolving the contested issues, but they require more time.&ldquo;We also want the court to order the CoG and Mailu not to frustrate further negotiations on the subject matter and promptly call and attend all negotiation meetings,&rdquo; the union says.The strike has been on since December last year. The medics have vowed not to resume duty until the 2013 CBA is implemented.
