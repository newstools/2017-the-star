Governor Evans Kidero has said he has made Nairobi better, despite opponents saying he has provided poor services, and accusing him of running a government riddled with corruption.He said he is not being fought over a poor development record, but because he is Luo.Graft aided by county officialsOpponents say there are frequent graft and land grabbing cases at City Hall, believed to be aided by county officials.Kidero&rsquo;s rivals are already banking on his &lsquo;poor development record&rsquo; to unseat him at the August 8 polls.They say the city is a mess and cash strapped, roads in disrepair, garbage piling up, drainage clogged, traffic a nightmare and land grabbed.But in a 20-page brochure, Kidero outlined his achievements.Upgraded roadsHe said 12 roads with a total distance of 10km have been done in different parts of the city in four years.They are Ruaraka, Kapiti Estate Access Road, Njiwa Road in Makongeni, Awendo Road in Dandora, Nzohe in Karen, Vanga Road and South C shopping centre road.Others are Upendo Road in Mathare, Muthurwa Road, Lumumba Road in Roysambu and Chalbi Drive.&ldquo;We have graded and gravelled roads in Kasarani, Embakasi, Dagoretti and Lang&rsquo;ata and built six bridges,&rdquo; reads the publication.Last week, Kidero said attacks directed at him have nothing to do with his development record, only his tribe.The city boss said he has opened 2,000kms of drainage in South C and Nairobi West, areas prone to flooding during heavy rains.Better healthcareOn health matters, Kidero said a 120-bed maternity wing has been built at Mbagathi Hospital and the capacity at Pumwani Maternity Hospital expanded to accommodate 80-100 births from 40 to 50 births per day.Residents say the county&rsquo;s health facilities have been plagued by perennial drug shortage, under-staffing and poor management. They say structures are dilapidated and essential equipment is lacking.But Kidero said the county has hired 437 new medical staff and equipped 17 health centres to operate 24 hours a day.Concerning the perennial water shortage in the capital, the governor said the situation has improved since he took office.He said he has installed 61 water dispensers and drilled nine boreholes, thus increasing the water supply to the city by one million litres a day.Currently, the city is experiencing acute water rationing due to a shortage.Kidero said security in the city has improved by over 75 per cent after the county installed 60,000 high masts in slums, rehabilitated 30,000 street lights and installed 50,000 new ones since 2013.
