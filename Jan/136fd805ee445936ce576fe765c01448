Students of Chulaimbo Boys secondary school in Kisumu lost their property following a fire that razed a classroom on Tuesday night.The affected classroom was one of the four that were used to store the student's personal belongings as schools closed for December holidays.Mattresses, boxes and lockers were among the property that was destroyed in the inferno whose cause is yet to be established.County commissioner Maalim Mohammed said the fire started at around 7.30pm from one of the classrooms which was completely destroyed.He said that efforts by the school's neighbours to put off the fire, coming just as schools are opening for the first term, were defeated."Property in the other three classrooms were salvaged. Only one room was burnt down to ashes," Maalim said, adding that the damage was estimated to be about Sh1.9 million.Elijah Omondi, one of the villagers who responded to the fire, said he saw smoke coming from one of the classrooms and raised an alarm.Deputy Principal John Okoth said the they will wait for police to complete investigations into the incident before they can issue a comprehensive report."The incident is very unfortunate because students who are opening this week will find their property burnt down," Okoth said.He thanked the community for their quick response to salvage the items in the other classroom.The county's fire brigade put off the flames and prevented the same from further spread, albeit late.Last year, many schools reported fires under circumstances that experts attributed to stringent measures to curb exam cheating.Read: List of more than 100 schools affected in June, July arson attacksAlso read: Schools in Tharaka Nithi, Nairobi lose dormitories as fires return in third term
