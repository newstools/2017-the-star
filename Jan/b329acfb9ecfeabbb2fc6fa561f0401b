The seven IEBC commissioner nominees are likely to be appointed to oversee this year&rsquo;s polls as a parliamentary committee vets them tomorrow.They are Wafula Chebukati, Consolata Nkatha, Abdi Guliye, Boya Molu, Margaret Mwachanya, Paul Kurgat and Roselyn Akombe.The Star has learnt the National Assembly Justice and Legal Affairs Committee is yet to receive any memorandum challenging the suitability of the nominees.The public had until today to forward petitions. &ldquo;The committee has received many memoranda commending the nominees, and there is no petition against any of them. Allegations against some nominees, including the chairman, reported in media may not be true,&rdquo; a source said. The integrity and suitability of nominees Chebukati (chairman) and Nkatha had been questioned. Concerns had been raised that Chebukati may have received proceeds of the National Youth Service scandal after acting as the lawyer of former EACC chairman Philip Kinisu. Kinisu was hounded out of office after it emerged his firm - Esaki Ltd - received Sh35 million from NYS. However, no one has given evidence to prove Chebukati also benefited from NYS money.Nkatha has been on the spot for allegedly having an active criminal court case. She was accused of defrauding the Museums of Kenya of Sh280 million.The nine-member IEBC selection panel chaired by Bernadette Musundi last Tuesday defended its choice of nominees on grounds there were no petitions rejecting their appointment, and various government agencies, including the EACC, cleared them.&ldquo;Had the allegations contained in the media been brought to our attention at the appropriate time, the panel would have brought the information to the attention of the two applicants before their interviews. The information would have had impact on the decision of the panel,&rdquo; Musundi saidShe said the panel only received a memorandum from Pwani University management recommending the appointment of Chebukati.
