President Uhuru Kenyatta on Tuesday assured Indian investors that Kenya is an open and safe investment destination.He urged the investors to venture into Kenya and explore existing opportunities, saying his government has undertaken a wide range of regulatory reforms that have reduced the cost of doing business. &ldquo;The Indian investors in Kenya will testify that we are an open and safe investment destination,&rdquo; the President said.He spoke during the 2017 Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit in Gujarati city, India, where he was the chief guest.The President said his government&rsquo;s efforts to improve the business environment were recognised by the World Bank in its 2015 publication &lsquo;Doing Business&rsquo;. The World Bank reported that Kenya had moved up 28 spots from 136 in 2014, to 108 in 2015, on the ease of starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting credit and paying taxes.To enhance Kenya&rsquo;s investment attractiveness, Uhuru said his administration has prioritised infrastructure to spur growth and create jobs. &ldquo;We have invested in mega projects and opportunities, including the expansion of the Port of Mombasa, airports, transport corridors, rail links and special economic zones to make Kenya a global economic and business hub,&rdquo; the President said.He said the economy is the largest and most integrated in East Africa, with significant utilisation of technology and innovation in businesses.Uhuru said Kenya has some of the highest mobile telephony and internet connectivity in Africa, as well as a highly educated, sophisticated, creative and enthusiastic human resource pool. &ldquo;Kenya&rsquo;s geographical position is ideal for investors to use as a launch pad to penetrate the enormous market of the more than 650 million people of the Tripartite Free Trade Area arrangement, which brings together 26 countries in northern, eastern and southern Africa,&rdquo; he said.Citing the African Development Bank, which indicated in its 2015 Outlook that Kenya defied both domestic and global problems to attract USD$1.9 billion (approximately Sh195 billion) in Foreign Direct Investment in 2015, Uhuru said this has proven the economy is stable and growing.He said the World Bank projected a continued robust growth trajectory, at 5 per cent last year, which is higher than the global average of 1.5 per cent.In 2015, Bloomberg reported that Kenya was the third fastest-growing economy in a global survey of 57 economies.
