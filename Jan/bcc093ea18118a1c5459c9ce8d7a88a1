The divisions among Jubilee Party Nairobi politicians yesterday played out before Deputy President William Ruto for a second time in a week.Remarks by Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko and Starehe MP Maina Kamanda pointed to deep divisions that are rocking the Nairobi team, months before the nominations.The same happened at Ruto's Karen home where one group accused the other of supporting outsiders to take over Nairobi politics.Sonko set the ball rolling by declaring that Nairobi leaders were not ready to allow "outsiders" to be imposed on them especially in regards to the Governor's position."We have been the leaders in Nairobi and anyone who wants to run for any position must join us and then we can go face the wananchi who will decide on who they prefer," Sonko said.He then went ahead to introduce Nominated MP Johnson Sakaja, Dagoretti South MP Dennis Waweru and former Starehe MP Margaret Wanjiru as the "real Team Nairobi."The four have been holding meetings to seek consensus on how to run for the elections and are set to give Ruto and President Uhuru Kenyatta their proposal in the coming weeks."We are all running for Governor and we have agreed that whoever gets the ticket will be supported by the rest. But we will not accept outsiders. If you think you can compete come and join us but no one will be imposed on the people of Nairobi," Sonko said.The Senator went on to ask Ruto and President Uhuru Kenyatta to declare that they have no preferred candidates for the August polls."People must respect each other. And we cannot allow people to keep misusing the President's name," Sonko said.It is believed that Sonko was referring to the entry of former Presidential candidate Peter Kenneth into the race for Nairobi Governor.A group of Nairobi leaders including former Town Clerk Philip Kisia and Kamanda are reported to be supporting Kenneth's bid which has not gone down well with the other team.When Kamanda stood to speak after Sonko, he said that no one should be locked out of Jubilee as the Senator had suggested."We will allow everyone to participate in Nairobi politics. Our goal is to eventually have one candidate to run for governor of Nairobi," Kamanda said.While pointing at Sonko, Wanjiru, Waweru and Sakaja, the Starehe MP told them to allow competition with other people.
