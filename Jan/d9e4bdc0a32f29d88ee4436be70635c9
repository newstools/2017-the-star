The national government should swiftly protect the rights of the people of Kitui, who are calling for help to end murderous attacks by armed bandits (see page 34).More than 2,000 internally displaced families are camped out in the bush in Kathungu, Katangini, Sosoma, Kiio and Ngooni villages in Ukasi.Most of them have no food and water.Heavily armed Somali bandits embedded among herders have descended on smallholder farms, driving large herds of camels and cattle.But the drought now ravaging large swathes of Northeastern does not justify rushing onto farms, armed with AK-47s and displacing unprotected farmer settlements.The people of Ukasi have turned to the national government because the county government of Kitui has no capacity to protect them. These farmers are armed only with bows and arrows and the situation is so dire that they&rsquo;ve armed their womenfolk too.Nairobi must not fail to protect the people of Kitui in the same way it has failed the people of Laikipia.
