Kisumu Deputy Governor Ruth Odinga has accused Governor Jack Ranguma of undermining her, following the partitioning of her office.She said Ranguma is trying to frustrate her by dividing her boardroom to accommodate his political advisors.Ruth said the governor is planning to displace her.&ldquo;Why else would he turn my boardroom into two offices to accommodate his political advisor Phillip Obiero and Grace Jobita?&rdquo; she said yesterday.Ruth said the move is meant to undermine her because she declared interest in the governor seat.A source within the governor&rsquo;s offices told the Star the county is short on space, and some officers have to share an office.He said the deputy governor&rsquo;s wing has not been divided.When the Star visited the office in Kisumu on the ninth floor of Prosperity House, the boardroom was locked, but everything seemed intact.County director of administration Titus Omanyi said Ruth&rsquo;s office has not been subdivided.He said the county only reduced the size of the reception to accommodate Jobita and Obiero.&ldquo;We have a challenge of office space, forcing us to make rooms for various officers by subdividing the newly created offices and existing ones,&rdquo; Omanyi said.He said the county will soon have to create more rooms for other offices.
