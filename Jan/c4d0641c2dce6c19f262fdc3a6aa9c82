A key parliamentary panel has been accused of brushing aside petitions from the public objecting to the nomination of at least two people as commissioners at the electoral agency.Homa Bay Town MP Peter Kaluma, a member of the Justice and Legal Affairs Committee, yesterday bashed the crucial panel for ignoring &ldquo;serious integrity concerns&rdquo; raised.The committee chaired by Ainabkoi MP Samuel Chepkong&rsquo;a on Thursday approved the nomination of Wafula Chebukati as chairman of the IEBC and six others as commissioners.During the two-day vetting, Chepkong&rsquo;a said there were no objections raised against the nominees.The committee okayed Abdi Guliye (Animal Scientist), Boya Molu, a human resource practitioner, Consolata Nkatha (Public Relations practitioner) and Kiswahili language expert Margaret Mwachanya for appointment as commissioners.However, Kaluma and Wajir woman representative Fatuma Ibrahim dissented with the report, saying there were serious integrity concerns raised against some nominees.&ldquo;We have been sent confirmations that some Kenyans presented memoranda opposing the nomination of some members,&rdquo; Kaluma said.&ldquo;Where did these petitions go to? We were being told no petition was received from the public. I have personally asked the chair and all that he told me is that there was no petition.&rdquo;There are concerns that other than nominees Roselyne Kwamboka, a political officer at the United Nations, and Paul Kurgat, a senior lecturer at Moi University, none of the other candidates has the necessary experience on electoral matters, a key requirement for their jobs.Kaluma said integrity questions had been raised against Nkatha and Molu, but the committee leadership allegedly ignored them. Molu was allegedly accused of &ldquo;dirty work&rdquo; in the judiciary.Nkatha allegedly has an active criminal court case in which she is accused of defrauding the National Museums of Kenya of Sh280 million.The nominee has two diplomas and two master&rsquo;s degrees but no bachelor&rsquo;s degree, Kaluma said.&ldquo;A bachelor&rsquo;s degree is a basic requirement for appointment as IEBC commissioner ... We can&rsquo;t ignore requirements stipulated in the Constitution,&rdquo; the Homa Bay Town MP said.&ldquo;How did she obtain a master&rsquo;s degree without a bachelor&rsquo;s degree? This is a fundamental issue that touches on the Constitution.&rdquo;Kaluma faulted the selection panel for failing to consider the need to have more than two nominees who are qualified lawyers to help in resolving dispute arising from primaries.Only the Chebukati is a lawyer.&ldquo;This is an issue the selection panel should have looked into. We need at least two lawyers. The chairman will be overwhelmed by disputes,&rdquo; Kaluma said.
