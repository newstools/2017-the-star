Kwale woman representative Zainab Chidzuga has started mobilising residents to buy the JP membership smart cards and support President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s reelection bid.The region, which has long been perceived as an opposition zone, is increasingly shifting as thousands of residents have joined JP. Chidzuga said she targets to register more than 80,000 members in a drive she launched on Monday, after meeting more than 700 members of her county committees.&ldquo;Today, I met my committee members. They have been shown how to register as members using the smart cards,&rdquo; she said. Chidzuga also said she is educating residents to register as voters. &ldquo;This will ensure we register enough voters and have enough members, because this is no longer a Cord zone but a Jubilee zone,&rdquo; she said.
