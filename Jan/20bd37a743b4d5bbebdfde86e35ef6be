The emphasis on electronic voter system is ignorance of what happens in Kenya, Attorney General Githu Muigai told a senate committee on Tuesday.The AG noted that many commentators on the amended election laws have misled Kenyans to think Kenya has an electronic voting system.Muigai, when he faced the Senate Legal Affairs Committee during the public hearing on contentious election laws, said the assertion was 'far from the truth .He said Kenya has a manual voting system that is supported by an electronic system, and not the other way round."In Kenya, we have a manual voting system with few electronic interventions. Voting largely remains manual," he said.Defending the use of a manual system in the scheduled August 8 general election, Muigai said the failure of electronic system is almost guaranteed.Read: Cord MPs walk out of special sitting as Jubilee's pass contentious election laws"...this is the nature of electronic gadgets. If the machines will fail for any reason, the paper ballot shall be in place to take over," Attorney General said."In my opinion we have a manual system, voting is not an event it is a process. We have no machines to count the votes, we empty the ballot box and count the votes manually," he said. Muigai said there can be system failure that Kenya must have a way to deliver and share the results adding "Manual system is the only way out.""We have no machine for counting votes, its a manual process," he said adding "When the system does not work, we create a transparent mechanism."He said a voter who wakes up to vote should not be turned away because of system failure."The manual process is meant to complement and we must eliminate possibilities of polling stations being closed down by returning officers because systems are not working," he said.The AG said Kenyans should listen to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission on the push for a manual voter system."Let us listen to IEBC and what they have to say. Relevant guidelines of electronic voting shall also be availed to the public for scrutiny," he said."Sometimes the medicine can be stronger than the disease." Muigai said Kenyans should be able to create a transparency mechanism where it can be established that nobody tampered with the system.But his comments were rejected by Mombasa Senator Hassan Omar, who said his claim that Kenya's system is manual is false."We don't want dead voters to vote. We want to cure mischief through the electronic system," the Mombasa senator said.Omar said the election laws came from a negotiated process and one political wing cannot single handedly amend them.FEARS OF HACKINGLast week, ICT CS Joe Mucheru based the state's push for alternative manual voting system on fears of al Shabaab interference with the 2017 poll.Mucheru, while appearing before the senate committee on legal affairs chaired by Amos Wako (Busia), defended the government's plan to amend election laws.He said the option of manual system was viable not only because of terrorism but also for reasons related to challenge in the country's telecommunication infrastructure.More on this Read:Al shabaab can interefere with electronic voting system, CS Mucheru saysThe National Assembly passed election laws that would allow a manual back up during the elections.The changes, which significantly alter the Elections Laws (Amendments) Act 2016, have been opposed by Cord leaders and members of the opposition.But Jubilee has said the manual voting system should be in place just in case technology fails.Read: Raila gives Uhuru nine-day ultimatum on election laws, says demos a last resortThe contentious election law arose from a negotiated agreement reached between Cord and Jubilee, that ended the anti-IEBC protests.A Joint Select Committee on the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission, led by Senators James Orengo (Siaya) and Kiraitu Murungi (Meru), midwifed the law.Read: Speaker Ethuro orders police to withdraw from parliament ahead of election laws debateAlso read: Election laws: Anxiety as Senate decides
