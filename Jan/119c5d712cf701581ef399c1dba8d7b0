The cartels opposing the 2016 KCSE exam results are the same ones determined to stop the ongoing education reforms, Education CS Fred Matiang&rsquo;i has said.The CS spoke yesterday at the launch of Equity Bank Foundation scholarships to 1,700 needy and bright children joining secondary schools.Matiang&rsquo;i listed reforms such as the review of the school calendar which made November an exclusive examination month. This was followed with unrest in schools, seen as part of the cartels&rsquo; efforts to defeat the education reforms meant to achieve credible exams. Some critics blamed the student unrest on the tough examination rules.&ldquo;These efforts came to naught as we ran a credible examination and released formidable results in both the KCPE and KCSE examinations,&rdquo; Matiang&rsquo;i said.&ldquo;We declined to heed their calls since we saw the hand of examination cheating and textbook sales cartels that wanted to stop us from implementing rules that could run them out of their illegal business, including hawking leaked examination papers.&rdquo;Knut secretary general Wilson Sossion, opposition leader Raila Odinga and other stakeholders have called for a review of the results.
