Webuye West MP Dan Wanyama has dismissed the opposition&rsquo;s meeting at Bomas of Kenya as &ldquo;pitiful&rdquo;.He criticised the opposition for failing to pick a presidential flagbearer, less than seven months to the General Election.&ldquo;We in Jubilee established our candidate way back, and that is President Uhuru Kenyatta. This is the homestretch. Jubilee has finished the game,&rdquo; Wanyama said on Wednesday.&ldquo;I want to tell Kenyans not to worry about NASA as it has the headache of choosing who will be its flagbearer, something that is likely to drift them apart.&rdquo;Wanyama urged Cord and its affiliates to forget about the August 8 poll and strategise instead for the 2022 election. The MP said Jubilee &ldquo;has already won&rdquo;, because of the projects it has initiated since 2013. &ldquo;I am shocked at my fellow politicians from the opposition who keep saying Jubilee leaders in Western are in government because of their tummies,&rdquo; he said.
