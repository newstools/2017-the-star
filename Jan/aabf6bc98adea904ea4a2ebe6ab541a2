The calendar girls of the Women&rsquo;s Institute who posed naked for charity may have been on to something.For stripping off and baring all helps make us feel happier, a study has found. Researchers found that those who cast off their clothes abandon their worries at the same time.Scientists revealed the unadorned truth after investigating the psychological effects of nudism. They found that people taking part in naturist activities felt better about themselves, their bodies and their lives overall. The more time they spent naked, or partially disrobed, the happier they were.Lead researcher Dr Keon West, from Goldsmiths, University of London, said: "The naturists have been saying this for some time. "However, little to no empirical research has investigated whether naturist activity (rather than attitude or beliefs) actually makes us happier or, just as importantly, why it makes us happier."In the first of a series of studies, an online survey of 850 British citizens found higher levels of contentment and positive body image among those who spent significant amounts of time wholly or partially naked in public.Two further studies took place at a &lsquo;Bare all for Polar Bears&rsquo; event at Yorkshire Wildlife Park and British Naturism&rsquo;s Waterworld event in Stoke-on-Trent.At both events, participants were psychologically assessed before shedding their clothes and before getting dressed again.In each case people experienced &lsquo;immediate and significant improvements in body-image, self-esteem and life satisfaction&rsquo; when nude. Analysis suggested that seeing others naked was more important than being naked yourself.Dr West, whose findings appear in the Journal Of Happiness Studies, said that many had assumed that public nudity was a sign of psychological dysfunction. But naturism may offer a simple solution to body dissatisfaction, he said.
