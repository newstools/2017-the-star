According to Facebook Security, when you take a photo, your camera attaches information, called EXIF data, to the photo. With some cameras, this is limited to the name of the file, its format, and date of creation.Modern cameras will also include the type of camera and photo settings, and cameras with access to the internet or GPS (like the cameras in smartphones) will sometimes attach the location where the photo was taken.Sometimes, posting things such as a letter with their address or a plane ticket, which has become sort of a lifestyle for most social media users, scammers could use such information to their advantage and scam you off!Now hackers can steal your fingerprints through photos where you are showing a peace sign. It has been proven that most people use either their thumb or index finger and sometimes the middle finger as their access to various security items that require access through finger prints.Researchers from Japan's National Institute of Informatics (NII) have found that fingerprints can be easily recreated from photos taken up to three metres away without the need for advanced technology. This is mostly in selfies.Today, if someone hacks one of your online account you can change your password easily. If someone steals your bank card, you just cancel it and get another one and so on. But if someone managed to steal and use your biometric data you wouldn't be able to change your fingerprints.So to ensure that you do not fall victim, kindly cease committing some of these small mistakes for instance taking selfies exposing some of your personal information. Failure to this you might regret it someday.Always keep in mind that in this digital era, anything can happen.
