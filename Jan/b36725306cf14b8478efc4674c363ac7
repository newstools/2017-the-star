Samsung is set to introduce three new smart watches to the Kenyan market that will see resurgence in the uptake of wearable technology.The three new models; Gear Fit2, Gear S2 and the Gear S3 will cater to the traditional health and fitness tracking function.New functionalities have also been announced in the devices as the firm seeks to bounce back from a torrid last quarter of 2016 that saw a dip in brand sales globally.To this end Samsung has partnered with performance footwear, apparel and equipment maker Under Armour to develop four health and fitness applications that will run on the smart watches.The partnership is aimed at providing fitness enthusiasts with a seamless and convenient sports experience, as well as access to Under Amour&rsquo;s digital community.UA Record&trade;, one of the apps from Under Armour is a dashboard for 24/7 activity, sleep and workout monitoring which Samsung has customized to display maps and routes.MyFitnessPal&reg; will track nutrition, calories and exercise by recording your dietary intake. Samsung have enhanced it to include water consumption logging and quick-add calories.The tech firm will be leveraging its sizable fitness community by introducing challenges functionality to the MapMyRun&reg; and Endomondo&trade; apps.The former offers tracking for every run, ride, walk and hike in one app, while the latter tracks route maps and allows sharing of workouts and customization of training plans.Samsung has added the challenge feature to both, a trend that has proven successful in growing an interactive community around their device ecosystems.As an added bonus, Samsung has also developed untethered tracking for the apps. This offers full functionality of the smart watches without the need of a smartphone which has been the main drawback with prior releases.The Gear2 Fit has had the UA Record&trade;, MapMyRun&reg;, and MyFitnessPal&reg; and the Endomondo&trade; app apps starting January 4.The Gear S2 and Gear S3 meanwhile will have downloadable updates of the suite of apps in early 2017 with complete features.
