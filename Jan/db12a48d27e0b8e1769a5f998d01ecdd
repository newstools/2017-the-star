Lamu politician Rishad Amana has asked Governor Issa Timamy to follow after his Mombasa counterpart Hassan Joho's bravery so as to fight for the resident's rights.He said Joho has show that leadership should be about being brave, firm and determined when pushing for development that benefits the constituents of a region.Amana said though the Jubilee administration has tried to break Joho like it did with Timamy in 2014, the Mombasa Governor has remained firm and unshaken. "Joho may or may not be delivering as people expected. But we prefer leaders who stand their ground because it is through this that we gauge good leadership," he said.The politician accused Timamy of being timid and easily shaken, citing the incident where the county boss was arrested over the Mpeketoni killings.President Uhuru Kenyatta at that time linked local politicians to the attacks largely believed to have been executed by al Shabaab militants.Amana said Joho is going through the same, but exuded confidence that the results will not be the same as that of his Lamu counterpart.But Timamy's aides dismissed the claims that their boss was timid as claimed by the politician, citing that the governor is a law-abiding citizen."[Joho] could not have resisted arrest. His leadership has been as firm as ever," an aide who sought anonymity said."In fact, he has even become bolder in fighting for the people of Lamu especially against land grabbers," the aide, who is not allowed to speak to the press, added.Amana spoke at a voter registration centre where he had gone to check the progress of the mass listing kicked off by IEBC on Monday.He said he will camp in the county to ensure ODM supporters register as voters in large numbers so as to win the August 8 general elections.The politician spoke at a time security officials in Mombasa are investigating if Joho has any links to the alleged illicit gun business run by his purported relative Ibrahim Khatri.Coast regional coordinator Nelson Marwa made unsubstantiated reports that Khatri&rsquo;s house in Ganjoni was ransacked and more than three guns recovered.Read: Police probe Joho link to alleged drug trade by kinJoho ran into trouble after he dared Uhuru to show projects that Jubilee has initiated in the region from scratch.Since then, his security detail was withdrawn and replaced later on, but the Governor declined the offer saying he does not need the officers.A day later, Joho claimed that he was detained alongside other leaders from the area when they sought the release of the said relative.They would be released from the Mombasa DCI headquarters after their supporters and other leaders from the county protested the move.More on this: Joho, MP Nassir released after allegedly being detained by Mombasa police
