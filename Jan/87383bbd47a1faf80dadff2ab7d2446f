Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana is embroiled in a fresh row with some &ldquo;anti-development&rdquo; MCAs out for political mileage.He accuses them of sabotaging his projects and tarnishing his image for political gain.Kibwana said the MCAs have stood in the way of the county&rsquo;s development in previous years of his administration by deliberately refusing to approve budgets.&ldquo;Some of the MCAs mudslinging me are trying to appease [Wiper leader] Kalonzo Musyoka with the hope of clinching Wiper tickets by appearing to be party stalwarts,&rdquo; the governor said.Kibwana said he will reach out to Kalonzo and urge him to set the bar higher for those seeking elective seats on the party&rsquo;s ticket. &ldquo;I will speak to Kalonzo not to fall for such manoeuvres by anti-development characters.&rdquo;The governor addressed residents in Kaiti subcounty during the commissioning of development projects. He was with Ukia MCA Samson Vaati.He told residents to vet their leaders ahead of the election to avoid self-seekers out to satisfy individual needs instead of advancing development. &ldquo;Being a governor is the most difficult job I have ever faced. It is even tougher than the clamour for constitutional reforms against former President Daniel Moi and his regime&rsquo;s status quo.&rdquo;The governor said his administration has achieved tremendous development, including construction of 84 dams supporting irrigation and providing clean drinking water. He also cited universal healthcare for residents.Other development projects include construction of the Kalamba Fruit Processing plant expected to be operational next month.Kibwana said campaigns by MCAs portray his government as having failed in development.
