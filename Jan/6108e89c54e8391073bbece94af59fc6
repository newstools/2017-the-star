Three sons of slain drug baron Ibrahim Akasha and a foreigner were yesterday charged with fighting in public. Baktash, Ibrahim and Abdulsalam Akasha together with Indian Vijaygiri Goswami denied fighting at Rahjan Bar and Restaurant in Kisauni. They appeared before a Mombasa court. The violent fight between them and Mombasa tycoon Ali Punjani was on December 31. A police report says Baktash sustained a deep cut on his head and was rushed to hospital and was stitched. The Akashas claimed to have been lured and beaten up by thugs, who drew guns on them. Their lawyer Cliff Ombeta pleaded with the court to release them on bond. The three are fighting extradition to the US, where they have been indicted on drug trafficking charges by a New York court. Their father was shot dead in Amsterdam in 2000, while on the run from Kenyan authorities after the discovery of a drug haul.
