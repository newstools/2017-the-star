Governor Evans Kidero gets the ODM ticket uncontested, Nairobi party chairman George Aladwa has said.Aladwa said at the end of the filing period last week, only Kidero had submitted documents to run for the seat. &ldquo;I can confirm that nobody applied to challenge Kidero. He is our sole candidate and we will give him the certificate,&rdquo; Aladwa said.This comes as the Jubilee Party is still weighing options and trying to decide who can defeat the incumbent and his war chest. In a meeting with Deputy President William Ruto last week, Jubilee politicians agreed to pick a candidate through consensus.Opponents will argue that four years on, the city is a mess, roads are bad, garbage piles up, land is grabbed and the city is short of money.The pick for Nairobi governor has, however, split the Jubilee Party. One group led by Senator Mike Sonko and nominated MP Johnson Sakaja say they do not want an outsider. They fronted Kabete MP Ferdinand Waititu.The second faction, mainly comprised of city lawmakers led by Starehe MP Maina Kamanda, wants the ticket to be handed to former presidential candidate Peter Kenneth.They argue he is more acceptable, capable and experienced and can mount the strongest campaign against Kidero.They have argued that Jubilee lost the seat in 2013 to Cord due to its &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; choice of candidate.Many Jubilee supporters are said to have voted for Kidero, whom they said was a better manager, compared to Waititu.Kenneth&rsquo;s supporters say the former Planning assistant minister is a better manager, compared to Sonko, who also wants the seat.Aladwa said Cord is better organised in the city since it already knows its candidate.He said Kidero will be backed by all the Cord and NASA affiliate parties after they struck a deal to field one candidate to counter Jubilee.Speaking at Kibera PAG Church on Sunday, Aladwa said ODM and Cord will mount intensive campaigns to ensure Kidero is reelected.&ldquo;In Nairobi, we&rsquo;re ready to face any Jubilee candidate,&rdquo; he said.Kidero said he is confident of retaining his seat, saying he is stronger now than in 2013. &ldquo;We must win 14 of 17 parliamentary seats and of 85 wards, Cord must win at least 65,&rdquo; he said.Kidero said is ready to face any JP candidate. He criticised politicians branding others &lsquo;outsiders&rsquo; who cannot run for election in Nairobi.He said Nairobi is the capital and therefore anybody has the right to run.
