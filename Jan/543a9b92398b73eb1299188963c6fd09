Former Konoin MP Julius Kones has dismissed claims that he has been bank rolled to contest the Bomet governor seat.He told MP Sammy Koech to concentrate on his affairs and stop maligning him in public instead of branding him a 'project'."I vied for the governor seat in 2013. I will be seeking the same during the August general election," Kones said.He referred to the legislator as 'a bitter rival who is still suffering from losing the seat in the 2007 general elections'.Read: Kones a project of Laboso&rsquo;s enemies, says MP Koech The water conservation chairman said: "He (Koech) should put more attention on delivering to his people rather than criticising me,""&hellip;he is not my equal and perhaps he should find some of his kind. I wonder where he (Koech) is drawing these claims yet I did not declare my bid today," he added.Kones said that his interest in the seat currently held by Isaac Rutto was driven by the people of Bomet."It is the people who have the mandate to choose their leaders," the national water conservation and pipeline corporation chairman said.At the weekend, Koech claimed that Kones was being sponsored by some power brokers opposed to the leadership of Sotik MP Joyce Laboso.Kones and Laboso are looking at using the Jubilee Party ticket during the scheduled polls.He added: "Instead of campaigning for other people, why doesn&rsquo;t he even try and convince his constituents first to vote for him in the coming elections,"Kones further stated that: "...because we all know he captured his current seat through some dubious means,"More on this: MP Laboso or Kones?
