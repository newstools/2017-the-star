Kenya could witness an increased flow of Indian investment following a resolution passed at a business forum chaired by President Uhuru Kenyatta in India.This is after the country's business leaders said that they have been encouraged by the conducive environment for investment created by Uhuru's administration.Chairman and Managing Director of Kanoria Chemical Limited Rajya Vardhan Kanoria made the comments during a Kenya-India Business Forum in New Delhi on Thursday."I have personally visited Kenya and I can testify that the environment for doing business has improved significantly," Kanoria told the business meeting.Members of the Kenya Private Sector Alliance (KEPSA) and the Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KNCCI) were in the forum.Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore, India&rsquo;s minister for Information and Broadcasting, lauded the President Kenyatta and PM Narendra Modi's zeal toward bettering the business climate in the two countries."The energy that President Kenyatta engages to improve the welfare of Kenyans reminds me that leadership matters. A lot of times, we as business people, like to see the kind of infrastructure that is there and the policies that are in place before we invest in a country," he said."But often these are linked to the leadership that is in that country," Rathore added, further noting that India has been transformed because of the leadership provided by Modi."It is not surprising that President Kenyatta&rsquo;s ratings in Kenya are soaring so high," Rathore said, "There are a lot of opportunities for Indian investors in Kenya under the leadership of President Kenyatta than ever before," President Kenyatta, who was wrapping up his State visit to India, urged the country's firms to set base in Kenya and take advantage of markets in eastern, central and southern Africa. "We are making further progress in the widening of this market through the Tripartite Free Trade Area, which will provide a market of over 650 million people," President Kenyatta said. He singled out the textile industry, infrastructure, agri-business, fertiliser manufacturing, medical equipment, and pharmaceuticals as some of the sectors open for investment. "I just want to repeat that Kenya offers a highly conducive business environment. We are the third most improved country in the 2016 World Bank Ease of Doing Business indicators," he said."This is owing to strong reforms in the areas of starting a business, obtaining access to electricity, registering property, protecting minority investors and resolving insolvency," the President said. The head of state emphasized that the success of Indian firms already based in Kenya should serve as a source of motivation and assurance that the country is a safe and lucrative investment destination. "We are also working to have closer cooperation between the Bureau of Indian Standards and the Kenya Bureau of Standards that will result in greater alignment between our two countries in terms of standardisation, conformity assessment, certification and testing," President Kenyatta said. He said the harmonisation will significantly reduce non-tariff barriers impeding trade between Kenya and India, and further welcomed the revival of the Joint Kenya-India Business Council."The council will give impetus to trade relations and enhance cooperation in bilateral investment, infrastructure development, SMEs, agriculture, health energy and entrepreneurship," President Kenyatta said. The President disclosed that Kenya has enacted the Public Private Partnership Act 2013 as well as the introduction of e-Procurement to ensure transparency in the procurement process. Cabinet Secretary Adan Mohamed assured Indian investors that Kenya is capable of delivering one of the highest returns in the continent in excess of 20 to 25 per cent in many of the sectors they would wish to invest in.Vimal Shah, who represented KEPSA, said the Kenyan business community has a listening Government under the leadership of President Kenyatta."Kenya is more open to business than ever before and it is the gateway to the whole of the African market," Shah told the Indian investors.A Memorandum of Understanding to establish a joint business council between the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) and the Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KNCCI) was signed at the forum.Read: Kenya to hire skilled, cheaper and jobless doctors from India, CubaAlso read: Uhuru receives full State honours with 21-gun salute in India
