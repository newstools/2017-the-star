Posta Rangers have made a move in the transfer market by capturing versatile defender Luke Ochieng who was among the players released by Gor Mahia.Ochieng was among the eight players, who were off-loaded by the 15-time champions last week, but found no difficulty berthing at a new place&mdash;Rangers&mdash;where he has signed a four-year deal.Rangers chairman John Tonui exuded confidence that Ochieng would shine for them in 2016 after a rather quiet season with K&rsquo;Ogalo.&ldquo;Ochieng has been given the same contract with the rest of the players&mdash;that is a long term contract. In fact, he has already started training with the team and I have a feeling he will do much better than he did in 2016.We are not yet done with recruitment. The technical bench is still working round the clock and we shall be making more announcements soon,&rdquo; he said on the KPL official portal.Rangers returned to the Kenyan Premier League in 2016 where they put up an impressive fight to finish in fourth position with 45 points.At the same time, Juma Abdalla has made a return to the Kenyan Premier League after joining Chemelil Sugar. Abdalla, previously with National Super League side Bidco United, signed a one year contract with the sugar millers on Saturday.The much-travelled Abdalla has also handled AFC Leopards, Thika United and KCB in his earlier stints in the top flight league. He replaces Francis Baraza who left the club after the end of the2016 season to join league champions Tusker as an assistant coach.Chemelil Sugar chairman Robert Nyakundi said on the KPL official website that they had settled on Abdalla after evaluating the options they had available to them.&ldquo;Coaches come and go and here at Chemelil we have never had a tradition of holding on to someone against their wish. That is why after speaking with Juma we agreed that he signs just a one year contract after which we shall evaluate an extension.&ldquo;We achieved a lot with our previous coach but he found what he felt was a good opportunity and we thank him for his good work in 2016.&ldquo;The club management is ready to give Juma the necessary support so that we can achieve our goals together,&rdquo; Nyakundi said.Abdalla will be returning to the SPL after two seasons. Bidco finished 19th on the National Super League table last season under his watch.
