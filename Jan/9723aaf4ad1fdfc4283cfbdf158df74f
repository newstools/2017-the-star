Kisumu Governor Jack Ranguma has accused senators of &ldquo;witch-hunting&rdquo; county chiefs. He said the frequent summoning of governors "under the pretext of fighting corruption in the counties" is derailing the implementation of projects.&ldquo;We have seen the government deliberately delaying to release funds to counties thereby slowing developments yet senators are just silent,&rdquo; he said after meeting boda boda operators in Kisumu town on Sunday.
