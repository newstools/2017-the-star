Vihiga Senator George Khaniri has urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to stop being hypocritical about a peaceful election in August. He said Uhuru and Deputy President William Ruto are not doing much to guarantee Kenyans free, fair, just and credible polls.&ldquo;The President should stop talking about peaceful elections when what he is doing curtails free and fair polls,&rdquo; Khaniri told the Star on the phone yesterday.He said Jubilee forcing through &ldquo;ulterior&rdquo; amendments to the election laws in the National Assembly and the Senate, and &ldquo;harassing&rdquo; opposition leaders are a recipe for chaotic elections.Khaniri said the Jubilee government has failed and the opposition is working on a strategy to remove it from power because &ldquo;it is disastrous for the country to be under the administration for another five years&rdquo;.&ldquo;Kenyans are tired of Jubilee because companies are closing down, the cost of living is rising and corruption is at its highest since Independence. Kenyans are saying they don&rsquo;t care who the candidate is, but they want the opposition to be united,&rdquo; he said. Khaniri said the Jubilee administration has turned the country into &ldquo;a personal kiosk&rdquo;, which it runs in total disregard of the law. He said politicians &ldquo;bought&rdquo; by Jubilee will be taught a tough political lesson by Kenyans because they are going against the will of the people.
