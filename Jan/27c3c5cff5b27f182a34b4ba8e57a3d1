The county communications director said he had been held since midday.Joho&rsquo;s lawyer Mohamed Balala told the Star Joho, the ODM deputy chairman, was detained after he went to find out why his support Ibrahim Katan had been arrested.&ldquo;Orders were issued that the governor and the rest should not leave and should be brought clothes, indicating they were to stay here long,&rdquo; he said.The development is the latest twist in the deepening feud between the Coast kingpin and President Uhuru Kenyatta and his Jubilee administration. In the past week, Joho embarrassed the President &mdash; and his security detail was withdrawn for three days.Yesterday police also raided the business of Mombasa county inspectorate director Naheed Musa, 30, a licensed gun dealer. Musa said the heavy police presence was a routine inspection.&ldquo;This inspection has come at the wrong time because of too much speculation out there. This thing is very normal,&rdquo; he said.Musa said the officers arrived at his firearms store in Nyali at 10 am to conduct regular inspection which is done four times annually.Meantime, police County communications director Richard Chacha told the Star the governor, who is ODM deputy chairman, was held since midday.&ldquo;The officers told him he also had to stay at the police station without further communication,&rdquo; Chacha said.Joho was accompanied to the station by Mvita MP Nassir. They were later joined by Bedzimba and several MCAs.By press time, all were still detained.Area OCPD Lucas Ogara told the Star he was not aware the governor was being held at the station.&ldquo;I have just left my office a few minutes ago. I am not aware of such an incident. Maybe it is at the DCIO&rsquo;s office but I am following the matter,&rdquo; he said.Joho has been a fierce critic of the administration at a time the Jubilee Party is trying to make inroads at the Coast, considered an opposition strongholdLast week, as Kenyatta was commissioning projects, the governor told him to his face to stop taking credit for projects in Mombasa that were commissioned and funded by the previous regime and by donors.Soon after, his bodyguards were withdrawn, as well as those of Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi, also a government critic. They were later restored.However, on Wednesday, Joho announced at an opposition meeting in Nairobi that he didn&rsquo;t need or want want government bodyguards and he wasn&rsquo;t afraid of dying.After his guards were withdrawn, he moved from his palatial Nyali home to a temporary residence with his own security.Mombasa County Commissioner Nelson Marwa had said the extraordinary withdrawal of security was part of a routine internal reorganisation.He also ordered 105 Mombasa county traffic marshals withdrawn from downtown, but Joho ordered them to remain.Marwa also said Joho and family members are in possession of firearms. Mombasa Senator Hassan Omar, who is campaigning against Joho, this week said Joho, his guards and entourage have at least 19 guns and frequently intimidate people. He called for a police investigation.On Wednesday during a joint meeting of opposition leaders at the Bomas of Kenya, Joho drove his car to the venue, without guards.On Thursday, administration police officers deployed to Joho&rsquo;s home in Nyali estate, Mombasa, were informed that the Governor had since moved out of the house to a safe place following the withdrawal of his security. The new tenant in the house asked the police to leave.Yesterday, police raided and ransacked the houses of Joho&rsquo;s relatives and friends and arrested one man, only identified as Haroub.Joho said in an interview that the raid was by government operatives out to find his whereabouts since he moved from his Nyali home.Joho said the government has resorted to chasing after his friends and relatives since he refused to &ldquo;budge and flirt&rdquo; with Jubilee.The Governor said the police officers&rsquo; motives were unclear but that they must be sinister.&ldquo;My cousin and friends&rsquo; houses were full of police officers this morning. I am told nothing was found,&rdquo; he said.The governor said he had rejected the newly deployed guards as there was no official communication regarding their deployment.The outspoken county boss said he had anticipated the raid and that he and those within his circle were psychologically prepared for the worst case scenario.
