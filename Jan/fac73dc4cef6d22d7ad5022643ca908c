The Kenya National Examination Council has seven days to pay more than 20, 000 teachers who supervised, invigilated and marked the KCSE exam.In a letter to Knec acting chief executive officer Mercy Karogo, Kuppet national chairman Omboko Milemba threatened to take unspecified action if the teachers will not have been paid their dues.&ldquo;Failure to pay the teachers within seven days, we shall take the next step, which shall not be good for the smooth running of the system,&rdquo; Milemba said.The KCSE was concluded on November 30 last year. Teachers who participated had hoped they would be paid by the end of December, as pledged by Knec. &ldquo;These teachers were looking forward to using the money to pay fees for their children, who are now either out of school or facing the risk of getting kicked out of school,&rdquo; Milemba said.Karogo said the council has been processing the payments. &ldquo;KCSE is not like KCPE. The KCSE exam require us to reconcile figures in terms of the number of days one worked,&rdquo; she said.
