Baringo Senator Gideon Moi has castigated leaders for prioritising campaigns for voter registration at the expense of tackling effects of drought in the country.He called upon President Uhuru Kenyatta to declare the situation a national disaster so as to attract financial assistance from external donors.The legislator said that the drought has adversely affected most parts of the country and therefore warrants urgent attention compared to voter listing.Leaders from across the political divide have been on a campaign trail, ostensibly in a bid to rally more Kenyans to list as voters ahead of the August 8 poll."It is ironic that leaders are bracing for mass voter registration to people who are on the verge of dying of hunger," Senator Moi said on Saturday.He said lives are at risk in Samburu, Turkana, Isiolo, Baringo and Kilifi whereby thousands of livestock have already died following the dry spell.The senator said that since nearly 30 out 48 counties that have been hit by drought, the situation qualifies to be deemed a national disaster.The government has reiterated its commitment to realign budgets to tackle drought, even as Kenya Red Cross on Friday launched the 'Kenyans4Kenya' fundraising bid to support the cause.Read: President Uhuru should now visit drought &mdash; stricken areasAlso read: Uhuru orders drought-hit schools to accept food as feesMore on this: Expect serious drought early in 2017, UN warns Kenya "We want the government to put measures to ensure no single Kenyan dies of hunger," Senator Moi said at the funeral of former Kabarnet Mayor John Kiprono.Kiprono was mourned as a loyal politician who stopped at nothing to push for development in Baringo. Moi further called on the government to install cancer screening machines in all county referral hospitals to cut cost of treatment.He also urged residents to ignore leaders imposed on them by top Jubilee Party leaders, probably in reference to Simon Chelugui of the Betting Controls Board.However, he urged residents to go to registration centres and be listed as voters ahead of the February 14 deadline of the 30-day mass listing.Baringo Governor Benjamin Cheboi, Baringo Central MP Sammy Mwaita, woman representative Susan Chesyna, MCAs among other politicians attended the funeral.Cheboi asked those eyeing elective posts in the coming election to stop engaging in premature campaigns and instead mobilise people to register.
