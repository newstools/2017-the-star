He is the fourth killing since December last year. The bandits attacked Misyili as he milked his cows.Residents living near the border between Kitui and Tana River counties have said they live in constant fear of attacks.Kitungati resident Elizabeth Kyalo said she heard gunshots on her way to Misyili&rsquo;s home to fetch firewood. &ldquo;I ran back to my house and picked my children then we fled our home,&rdquo; she said.When the police arrived at the scene, residents stopped them from taking away the body. Led by a Florence Mwende, the residents demanded that the police first pursue the killers.She said the villagers were unhappy police took more than 18 hours to respond to a distress call, and even then, they only seemed interested in taking away the body, rather than pursuing the bandits.Pleas by Sosoma village administrator Mbithe Mulu to calm the residents fell on deaf ears.He criticised the police for taking too long to respond.On Christmas Eve last year, the bandits from Tana River county invaded Kitui and posed as herders.They gunned down a man in Katangini village, Ukasi ward.A few days later, they shot dead two other herders in Inyanzae, Ukasi.
