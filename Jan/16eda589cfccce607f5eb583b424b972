Can they concentrate on the ongoing voter registration exercise instead of making allegations that only serve to heighten public anxiety?" he asked.He said his ministry was focused on its mandate of enabling youths to access digital jobs and had no intention of engaging in electoral fraud."They have no facts to back their wild allegations," he added in a statement on Thursday.Musalia Mudavadi's coalition asked that Mucheru, Joseph Nkaissery (Interior) be investigated for allegedly planning to use technology to rig the August election.Osotsi said on Wednesday the two should be investigated alongside other government officials.The others are Major General (Rtd) Gordon Kihalangwa (Director of Immigration and Registration of Persons), the IEBC Secretariat especially the ICT department and Lucy Ndung&rsquo;u, who is Registrar of Political Parties."Jubilee Party&rsquo;s launch of the smart card and the timing of their countrywide membership registration is designed to coincide with the ongoing voter registration for an ulterior maneuver to connect Jubilee election rigging experts to the IEBC voters&rsquo; database..." he claimed.He said strategic technology infrastructure, the National Registration Bureau and RPP data would also be tampered with, through a software application interfaced using short code 30553.Osotsi said the software will allow the ruling coalition's ICT gurus access to manipulate the IEBC, NRB and RPP's databases.The secretary general further alleged that the multiple sharing of IDs is a consequence of this fraud and an act of preventing Kenyans from choosing preferred leaders, inline with the constitution.[VIDEO] Raila links NIS to election fraud, voter listing in Uganda and EthiopiaMore on this: Raila reports double registration but says he will not complain again of rigging
