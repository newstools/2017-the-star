More than 100,000 people in Pokot North subcounty, West Pokot county, are in dire need of food as drought ravages the region. Area MP Mark Lomunokol said livestock herders have migrated to Uganda in search of water and pasture, as some dams have dried up. &ldquo;The owners of cows left behind last week have moved them to Uganda because there is no pasture, compared to the previous years,&rdquo; he said.Lomunokol said residents, who depend on livestock, are going without food. He said they have to travel more than 10km for water. The MP urged the government to provide relief food. Lomunokol said many schoolchildren have been greatly affected, especially those in new institutions with no feeding programmes. &ldquo;Some of the children have even moved to Uganda with their parents. The drought has really hurt learning,&rdquo; he said.Lomunokol urged the Education ministry to introduce feeding programmes in schools. The legislator said schools providing food are overpopulated. &ldquo;The meals encourage and retain the pupils in school,&rdquo; he said. The most affected areas are Kiwawa, Kodich, Kapchok, Kasei, Ompolion and Alale. Ompolion chief Joseph Korkimul said some livestock keepers are afraid of moving to Uganda with their animals because of diseases.He said pastoralists lost many animals in Uganda last year after the outbreak of an unknown disease. There&rsquo;s an outbreak of avian flu in Uganda. He said in Uganda, water is only found in River Suam. Korkimul said in his location, a single dam serves both livestock and people. Last week, the National Drought Management Authority released a report showing Central Pokot subcounties are worst hit by the drought and appealed for food aid.
