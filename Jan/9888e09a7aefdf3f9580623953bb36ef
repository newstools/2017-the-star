A section of ODM governors and MPs are among aspirants who are yet to submit their nomination applications to the party even though the deadline is today.The applications are required to allow the party to prepare for the primaries next month. Party chairman John Mbadi hinted that the deadline will not be extended after previous extensions from the original deadline of November 30 last year.&ldquo;The national executive committee agreed not to extend it further,&rdquo; Mbadi, who is also the Suba MP, said yesterday, before referring us to Judy Pareno, the ODM national elections board chairperson.According to the party&rsquo;s election plan, aspirants seeking the presidential nomination are required to pay a non-refundable fee of Sh1 million, governors Sh500,000 and MPs, who include Senators and members of the National Assembly, Sh250,000.MCAs must pay Sh25,000 before they are cleared for nomination, and those classified in the category of special interest groups - the disabled, women and youth &mdash; Sh15,000.However, aspirants in areas where ODM enjoys a fanatical following have questioned the &ldquo;huge&rdquo; fees, saying it may not make sense paying the amount if the nomination process is not transparent. &ldquo;Some of us are worried that we may not be subjected to a fair nomination, which makes it more difficult to part with the money required,&rdquo; a governor from Nyanza said.&ldquo;It is this assurance that we want from the party because losing the money and the nomination through a fraudulent process amounts to double jeopardy,&rdquo; an MP from Siaya county said. He added, &ldquo;It is for this reason that some of us may find our way to other entities, but within the Cord family, the party has not addressed it.&rdquo;
