I&rsquo;m a consulting surgeon working at the top referral hospital in the country and my monthly take home salary is Sh180,000.If anyone can believe that a junior doctor is taking home Sh140,000 as claimed by the government, then you are not being realistic. Much of this money is in the form of allowances, meaning it does not count towards my retirement benefits.Therefore, if I was to rely on my salary alone, I would at my time of retirement have no income to speak of. I have no health cover.Main story: Kenya to hire skilled, cheaper and jobless doctors from India, CubaSo when I&rsquo;m sick, I can hardly pay for the services I provide. My high school colleagues currently in other professions, know they make much more than I do.To build my income, I engage in private practice, which I must do outside my work hours. This means when you are at home relaxing with your families, I&rsquo;m somewhere serving &ldquo;middle class&rdquo; people like you, who imagine I must be very wealthy because their insurance pays me.For those of you who work in the insurance industry, you know it can take up to six months to get payment of medical claims. Some of my claims have taken up to two years and some have never been settled.When things go wrong with your treatment, you are the first to rush to court. Do you know how much it costs to settle malpractice claims?I&rsquo;m the one who must balance the risks and benefits of every treatment and ensure you come out not just alive, but better. None of this is ever remembered when things do not go as planned.I can&rsquo;t understand people who think the life of a doctor is a walk in the park and we are entitled idiots. If only you could put yourself in my children&rsquo;s shoes!Their father never comes for their sports day at school or even for their prize giving when they emerge tops in their classes, never helps them with their homework and doesn&rsquo;t know the names of their friends because he is never there to meet them.Look yourself in the mirror and honestly ask yourself who should be paid more. Is it a politician or the man who helps save you and your loved ones at your most vulnerable moment?Hypocrisy does not sit well with you, get off your high horse.The author is a consulting surgeon
