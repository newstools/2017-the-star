Musalia Mudavadi's coalition wants CSs Joe Mucheru (ICT), Joseph Nkaissery (Interior) investigated for allegedly planning to use technology to rig the August election.Godfrey Osotsi, who is Amani National Congress secretary general, said on Wednesday that the three should be investigated alongside other government officials.The others are Major General (Rtd) Gordon Kihalangwa (Director of Immigration and Registration of Persons), the IEBC Secretariat especially the ICT department and Lucy Ndung&rsquo;u, who is Registrar of Political Parties.Osotsi claimed the IEBC secretariat and Jubilee Party were secretly coordinating as part of an elaborate scheme to rig the August 8 poll."Jubilee Party&rsquo;s launch of the smart card and the timing of their countrywide membership registration is designed to coincide with the ongoing voter registration for an ulterior maneuver to connect Jubilee election rigging experts to the IEBC voters&rsquo; database..." he claimed.He said strategic technology infrastructure, the National Registration Bureau and RPP data would also be tampered with, through a software application interfaced using short code 30553.Osotsi said the software will allow the ruling coalition's ICT gurus access to manipulate the IEBC, NRB and RPP's databases."It's like the Kencall deal of 2013. The manipulation ensures votes cast during Jubilee nominations remain in the IEBC system and that's what will be declared Jubilee's winning votes, plus some top ups to conceal the fraud," he claimed."This why Jubilee is upbeat it will get 60 per cent of the vote in August."The secretary general further alleged that the multiple sharing of IDs is a consequence of this fraud and an act of preventing Kenyans from choosing preferred leaders, inline with the constitution."Ten million of these illegally registered voters will fraudulently find their way in IEBC data base as having voted for Jubilee Presidential candidate in August," he said.Read: [VIDEO] Raila links NIS to election fraud, voter listing in Uganda and EthiopiaMore on this: Raila reports double registration but says he will not complain again of riggingOsotsi further stated that the fraud was the reason why Jubilee planned its membership recruitment to coincide with the ongoing mass voter registration."It is mischievous that while Jubilee has bragged about being digital, their focus has strictly been on using ICT for executing political fraud and economic crimes," he said."No wonder Jubilee has been very keen on combing the whole country to recruit and retain at all costs top ICT experts to execute electoral fraud on Kenyans."Read: Jubilee plans to rig 2017 polls - RailaAs the election date nears, leaders in Jubilee and the opposition are leaving no stones unturned in their bids to garner the most support.The opposition has often accused Jubilee of planning to rig the poll, an allegation that motivated the overhaul of the electoral commission and the appointment of Wafula Chebukati as chairman alongside six commissioners.But President Uhuru Kenyatta and his team have denied the allegations saying Raila Odinga and his supporters have no plan for winning the poll and for developing Kenya.Read: Raila lashes out at 'rotten' Nkaissery over double listing of IDsAlso read: Nkaissery's warning to chiefs 'outward, backward', says Cord
