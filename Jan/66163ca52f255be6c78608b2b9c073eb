Kikuyu elders from Thika subcounty have given Royal Media Services chairman SK Macharia seven days to apologise over his "reckless remarks" that Raila Odinga won in the 2007 election against President Mwai Kibaki or they will curse him.President Mwai Kibaki was declared the winner. The dispute led to the 2007-08 post-election violence that left more than 1,000 people dead and about 600,000 displaced.They termed Macharia&rsquo;s sentiments as rabble-rousing and ill-timed.The elders said they will march to his Gatanga home and curse him if he fails to heed to apologise.The more than 500 elders, representing 13 clusters of the Agikuyu, spoke at Kiratina in Gatuanyaga, Thika East.They said that Macharia&rsquo;s outburst was only meant to open the healing wounds of the 2007-08 post-election violence and it could create animosity between communities.Central Region Council of Elders chairperson Njoroge Karatu accused the RMS boss of failing to table evidence supporting his sentiments.&ldquo;What he has done is very irresponsible of a Kikuyu elder of his caliber. Why is he bringing up such an issue at a time when the country is headed to a general election? His remarks would ignite ethnic clashes because communities supporting the opposition might believe that then elections were rigged,&rdquo; he said.They accused Macharia of being Cord leader Raila Odinga&rsquo;s puppet and said he was speaking on behalf of the ODM leader.&ldquo;Macharia is being used by Raila Odinga to ignite flare-ups as it has become apparent that they will lose in this year&rsquo;s general elections. Just as they did in 2007 by having a parallel tallying system, they are plotting the same this year hoping to get to power in a coalition government,&rdquo; Karatu said. The elders questioned Macharia&rsquo;s interests in the general election that he is ready to counter the IEBC tallying system with a Sh15 billion parallel system.Last week, Macharia revived a 10-year-old dispute that plunged the country into chaos when he told the Senate&rsquo;s Legal Affairs Committee that former Prime Minister Raila Odinga won the 2007 presidential elections.Although he failed to substantiate his allegations during his submission of the contentious Election (Amendment) Bill, he claimed to have evidence showing that Raila won.The businessman claimed his media house conducted a parallel tallying of votes from all polling stations countrywide, where statistics showed that Raila emerged the victor.&ldquo;The one who was declared the winner in 2007 was not the winner. We tracked all the results through satellite phones and as per my records, Raila won the elections,&rdquo; Macharia told the senators when he gave a historical perspective of why elections in Kenya are disputed.
