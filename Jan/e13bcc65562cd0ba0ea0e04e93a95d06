Lands CS Jacob Kaimenyi yesterday denied claims that documents issued by the ministry after 2013 are illegal.He said the court gave the ministry a window of one year to fine-tune land laws in tandem with Land Laws (Amendment) Act 2016. &ldquo;I wish to reassure the public that contrary to what is reported in the Standard newspaper of January 17, 2017, and other electronic media, that grants, leases and certificates of titles issued by the ministry after 2013 are legal, valid and legitimate,&rdquo; Kaimenyi told the press in his office.He urged the Standard newspaper to apologise for creating fear and doubt on land ownership documents.Nairobi lawyer Anthony Otiende, moved to court in 2015, seeking to nullify regulations and forms for preparing leases that were implemented by then Lands CS Charity Ngilu. High Court judge Joseph Onguto said the Lands ministry prepared lease documents in violation of the law by ignoring the input of the National Land Commission.The judge also ruled that the documents had not been subjected to public participation or Parliament scrutiny and approval.However, Onguto had given the ministry a window of 12 months to correct the anomalies, saying the declaration of invalidity was not to be operated retroactively.Onguto had also ordered Kaimenyi to engage the NLC, the public and the Parliament.The judge said the 12 months window had taken effect from December 19 last year and failing to effect his orders will make the documents stand annulled.The judgement was delivered on December 19 last year, while the Deputy Registrar of the High Court certified the orders on January 12 this year.Kaimenyi said he has appointed a task force after consulting with the NLC to come up with regulations within two months.He was accompanied by PS Mariam el Maawy, NLC chairman Muhammad Swazuri and NLC chief executive Tom Chavangi.The task force is composed of members drawn from the ministry, the NLC, the Kenya Law Reforms Commission, the Attorney General&rsquo;s office, the Institution of Surveyors, the Nairobi county government and the Law Society of Kenya. Kaimenyi said the ministry will continue giving services in regard to land transactions within 12 months granted by court. Parliament is yet to approve regulations, as stipulated by land laws.
