Livestock prices in Tanariver County have drastically gone down following the prolonged drought that has affected over 120,000 people and led to deaths of thousands of animals.Pastoralists claim that cattle which could be sold at between Sh 20,000 and Sh 25,000 now go for less than Sh10,000.The same price drop has affected goats and sheep which now can be sold at less than Sh 3,000 down from the initial price of more than Sh 5,000.Those highly affected are the pastoralists who have to travel for long distance to sell their livestock.The drop in prices is expected to worsen in the near future following the weatherman prediction that the drought situation might last for six more months.Already thousands of livestock have become weak and are not able to fetch the best prize and if the drought persists they will not only continue to die but their value would reduce more.Currently, Kenya Red Cross society in collaboration with the county steering group, is implementing a Sh 7.5 million de-stocking programme targeting the most vulnerable pastoralists in the remote part of the county.Even though the numbers of livestock are few, the beneficiaries are happy to get money and free meat at the same time.Cattle are bought at a prices between Sh10, 000 and Sh 15,000, while goats go at a rate of between Sh 5,000 to Sh 3,000. A Sheep on the other hand is bought at between Sh 2,000 to Sh 3,000.Kenya Red Cross Coast regional manager said in the first phase, they shall buy 450 cattle, 246 goats and sheep.Locals interviewed in some of the areas visited revealed that getting market for their livestock is a major challenge.At Koticha village in Wayu location of Galole constituency for example, residents said the cattle sold to Kenya Red Cross could have died if they did not come to buy them from their homes.Moreover they were happy to have received double the amount in price of the livestock.&ldquo;Cattle are dying because of loss of weight, we thank Kenya Red Cross for buying our livestock, we shall use the money to pay fees,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Ibrahim Dido, a resident of Kotiche who got Sh15,000.Dido said he got double price for his cow meaning that in their market it would have been sold at Sh 7,500.He said from Kotiche to Wayu where their market lies is a stretch of eight kilometers and due to the poor health of the livestock, some die while being taken for sale.
