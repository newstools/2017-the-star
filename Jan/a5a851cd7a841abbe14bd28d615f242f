President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s political adviser Joshua Kuttuny will use a new slogan and strategy as he seeks to reclaim the Cherangany parliamentary seat which he lost in 2013.Kuttuny&rsquo;s new slogan is &lsquo;Heshimu Raia&rsquo; (Respect the citizens). He lost to incumbent Wesley Korir who stood as an independent candidate. He has since joined the Jubilee Party to defend his seat.The race has so far attracted more than 10 aspirants but Kuttuny and Korir are the front runners for the Jubilee ticket.He will resign from next month and shift his base to Cherangany where he will launch his campaigns.&ldquo;Since the last elections, I have learnt a lot of lessons, which are very important in politics. I have learnt it&rsquo;s important to always respect the ordinary people because they are the employers in politics,&rdquo; Kuttuny, who spoke to the Star on the phone, said yesterday.He said his campaign strategy will be slightly different mainly because of what he has been doing at State House.&ldquo;I will closely work with the residents of Cherangany and I am confident they will elect me,&rdquo; Kuttuny said. He is also expected to be one of the key Jubilee strategists and campaigners for the reelection of President Uhuru. He is among the top civil servants who are expected to resign by February 7 to join politics. Korir, however, says, &ldquo;Through CDF and other programmes, I have transformed the lives of residents of Cherangany. I am confident they will give me another chance to serve them.&rdquo;
