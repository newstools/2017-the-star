A day after the Aulyhan clan endorsed Garissa Governor Nathif Jama (pictured) for a second term, two aspirants eyeing the seat have dismissed the approval.Speaking to the press in Garissa town on Monday, Omar Abdi termed the endorsement fake, saying aspirants were not consulted. &ldquo;I think they have started the exercise on the wrong footing. Consultations should take a minimum of three months for everybody to participate,&rdquo; he said. Omar urged the nine elders from all the subclans to restart the negotiations to make the endorsement credible and acceptable to all. Aspirant Ahmed Aden said the elders who endorsed Jama are sycophants out to ruin his political career.
