Cord leader Raila Odinga has called an urgent meeting to come up with a new strategy to mobilise his Nyanza supporters to enlist as voters.He is expected to meet all governors, MPs and county assembly majority leaders from the four counties in Luo Nyanza.Kabondo Kasipul MP Sylvance Osele said the low turnout is worrying the ODM camp and its leaders. &ldquo;Most of us, including Raila, are frustrated that at the time we expected our supporters to enlist us voters is when they go for IDs,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;We want to ensure those who have newly applied for IDs also register to vote.&rdquo; Osele was addressing the press in Homa Bay Town on Saturday.Nyanza is one of the regions with the least turnout in the final mass voter registration, according to a report released by IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati last week. Central, on the other hand, is in the lead. Osele said, &ldquo;We must put in place measures on how we can deal with voter aparthy since we&rsquo;re told that at the 2013 elections about 800,000 people from Nyanza failed to cast their votes.&rdquo;Political leaders, both from the opposition and government are traversing the country to urge Kenyans to register as voters. Registration will end.
