The government has assured the Makonde community that their IDs are ready for distribution to enable them take part in the ongoing mass voter registration.Kwale deputy county commissioner Mwangi Kahiro said that 1,000 identification cards for those who registered in 2016 are ready in Mombasa."We have only some 73 IDs which are yet to be processed. We are waiting for all of them so that they can be distributed together," Kahiro said. Kahiro said that there is no cause for alarm over delays in the issuance of the IDs to the Makondes, adding that the state will ensure the documents reach them."The 73 IDs are expected to be ready by the end of this week. We did not want to give them in bits," he added.This was after members of the community expressed worries as they were yet to get the cards as the mass voter registration kicked off on Monday.Lupina Asmani, Lucy Sawaka, Beatrice Fundi and Zuena Fundi blamed the government for not honoring their promise to bring the documents by December."The president said we should be given our IDs before December 25, 2016. But that did not happen and they have remained silent," Asmani said."We are worried that Kenyans are registering as voters while we are not sure of our fate," she said.The elderly woman said she would like to vote for the first time in Kenya, adding that it will be a historic experience for her.The Makondes have lived in the country for many years but had not been accorded citizenship until President Uhuru Kenyatta intervened last year.Read: [VIDEO] Uhuru okays stateless Makonde community's citizenship, title deeds claimAlso read: At least 295 Makonde community members get IDs in Kilifi "I thought I would vote this year but now that the ID itself is not there, I think it will be impossible," she said. Lucy Sawaka said they are still hoping that the government will keep its word on the IDs for them to register as voters.Youth representatives Beatrice and Zuena said that they are disappointed that the documents are yet to reach."Why did they register us and give empty promises. We cannot register as voters like other Kenyans because government has not given us IDs," Zuena said.Read: Nakuru voters complain of machine failure as IEBC listing kicks off
