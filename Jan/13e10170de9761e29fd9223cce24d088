Vihiga Senator George Khaniri on Wednesday said he will announce the party he will use to seek reelection on Sunday. Khaniri opted to remain an independent candidate for the remainder of his term after UDF dissolved in September last year to join the Jubilee Party. &ldquo;I had taken a sabbatical to mediate in the opposition&rsquo;s matters,&rdquo; Khaniri said.
