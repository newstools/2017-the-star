Homa Bay County leg of the Kenya Volleyball Federation national league has been done away with for the 2017 season ahead of the calendar opener set for March in Malaba, Busia County.The federation has tentatively sliced off Homa-Bay circuit the 2017 calendar and as a result, the league will have seven legs. This leg has been part of the calendar for two previous seasons, 2013 and 2016. Following the move, the league will roll up in March as opposed to the traditional February, with the first circuit set for March 3-5 in Malaba.&ldquo;There are a few logistical matters that forced KVF to do away with the Homa-Bay circuit. However, once we have the issues addressed, we will consider it back to our calendar,&rdquo; noted Ismail Chege, KVF fixtures secretary. Homa-Bay, with its harsh weather conditions and the scorching sun has been a tough outing for most teams, though it has always served as a decider for the play-offs in the last two seasons. Last season, Nairobi Water men&rsquo;s outfit stunned Kenya Prisons in Homa-Bay leg to book a place in their maiden playoff. In the meantime, the national volleyball governing body has initiated talks with various corporate companies and private persons to sponsor a circuit in Kericho County to make eight leagues for 2017. Kericho last hosted a successful national volleyball league in 2014 at the Kericho Teachers&rsquo; College.&ldquo;If we secure a sponsor for an extra leg, we will slot the eighth leg for Kericho, if not, then we will do with seven circuits,&rdquo; added Chege.
