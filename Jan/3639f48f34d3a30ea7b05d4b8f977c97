Lamu county commissioner Joseph Kanyiri yesterday ordered police to arrest anyone carrying knives, machetes and clubs in public. He warned the youth against joining criminal gangs, saying they won&rsquo;t be spared in an ongoing crackdown. Kanyiri said his office is aware of increasing attacks with crude weapons, hence, the need for the disarmament to ensure peace. The ban on crude weapons was introduced in 2015 following attacks on residents and tourists that left several people dead, including a local chief. Scores of others were maimed. However, new cases of attacks have been reported in a upsurge of crime.
