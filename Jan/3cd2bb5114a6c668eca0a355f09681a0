The bank will not work like most commercial banks, Ranguma said. It will issue loans at affordable interest rates.He spoke during an event for boda boda operators in Kisumu town on Saturday. &ldquo;We have established a secretariat and I have transferred staff from Kisumu county to run the office,&rdquo; Ranguma said.Controller of Budget Agnes Odhiambo has approved the project, he said. The bank will be headquartered in Kisumu, with a branch in Nairobi.Ranguma said the counties will buy an existing bank. &ldquo;We have hired Deloitte to find us a bank interested in a buyout. It is easier to buy an existing bank and change its name, instead of starting a new bank,&rdquo; he said.The bloc has already opened an account at the Central Bank of Kenya.Bank deputy chairman Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya will also transfer staff to the secretariat.The regional bank will be wholly owned by the counties.Ranguma said the counties are committed to remitting the Sh200 million to start the bank. The assemblies have approved the amount, he said.&ldquo;The bank will be an economic pillar of the bloc. The counties also plan to set up two regional referral hospitals in Kisii and Kisumu counties,&rdquo; Ranguma said.He said the bloc will have seven economic pillars.
