ODM leader Raila Odinga has said the opposition will not hold mass protests to oppose passage of election laws but focus on voters registration within the next 30 days.In a change of tactic, Raila said Kenyans should focus on registering as voters before making a decision on the election laws passed by parliament."We have learnt our lessons. Let us focus all our energies on registering people. As your leaders, we will be visiting your areas to show our support," he said."Each day we must register the maximum number possible, we must not let the IEBC get away with mischief."The electoral commission will begin the registration exercise on January 16, ahead of the general election set for August 8.Raila had threatened to lead the demonstrations from January 4, before the laws were signed.The Cord chief said at the time that their consultations showed Uhuru and DP William Ruto's Jubilee Party was not ready for free and fair elections.He said the amendments demonstrated Jubilee's "appetite to stay in power, survive on impunity and marginalise poor citizens".Raila called off the demonstrations on December 29, lauding the Senate for allowing members of the public to give their views on proposed amendments.Read: Cord declares mass demos from January 4 after disputed election laws passedAlso read: Cord calls off January 4 demos, lauds Senate for inviting public input on election lawsThe opposition chief told an enthusiastic crowd of supporters that they should step out as agents of change and not be intimidated by anybody."We remind Jubilee that the cost of stealing this election again will be regrettable," he said."The time for change is now. Hold hands and say we are going to move together," he said.Raila told aspirants that if they lose nominations they should not despair."If you lose, don't worry. We are going to be in government and you will have something useful to do," he said.In an earlier address, Amani leader Musalia Mudavadi also urged Kenyans to unite saying the big super alliance team is capable of trouncing Jubilee."Pray for us to solidify, to be one and to be united, and we shall win," he told supporters during an opposition rally at Bomas of Kenya in Nairobi on Wednesday."Let us all come together. This way, we will win the elections in the morning. I am an advocate of a united opposition because we do not want to lose even a single vote."More on this: Pray for NASA to solidify, trounce Jubilee, Mudavadi tells Bomas crowdThe opposition had claimed a manual voting system would allow ghost voters to participate in this years poll, and termed the laws a rigging plot by Jubilee.The Jubilee administration and the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission both dismissed the claims.IEBC chief executive Ezra Chiloba said voters will be identified electronically, and that the manual system will only be used in the event that the former fails.Read: State of elections preparedness: Mass Voter Registration CampaignAlso read: Uhuru signs election laws to allow use of manual back up in August poll
