The national cohesion team has launched investigations to unravel the voice in an incitement audio that has been tied to National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale.The speaker in the recording is heard asking youths not to allow Kamba's to register as voters in the August 8 general election, and to prevent their movement to poll centres in Garissa.NCIC chairman Francis ole Kaparo told the Star on phone on Friday that the commission's probe will be centred on establishing the veracity of the two-minute clip."We have dispatched our detectives to establish where the audio was recorded and advise on further action," said Kaparo, who said he was alerted by a colleague.The NCIC boss noted no one is above the law and that Duale will be dealt with accordingly should he be found responsible."We have prosecuted such cases. Of course if evidence points to anyone, the person must be handled as per what the law stipulates on incitement," he said.Read: NCIC &lsquo;vehemently opposes&rsquo; bail for hate-monger MPs in cellsAlso read: MPs charged with hate speech: Uhuru did rightDuale dismissed as outrageous the audio clip widely circulated on social media, and which resulted in a call for his arrested under Twitter hash tag #ArrestDuale.The Garissa Town MP denied that the voice was his and demanded confirmation of the venue, who the youths being addressed were and any other evidence.
