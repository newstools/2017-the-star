One man was shot dead and over 16 houses were burnt down following clashes between Maasai and Kipsigis community members at the Trans Mara West-Trans Mara East border on Wednesday.Oronka chief Leboo ole Munke said the Maasai man died during a fierce five-hour battle between the communities at Pombiniet area.He said several people were injured in the renewed conflict that came after Maasai herders were denied access to a water drinking point at the Mogor river by Kipsigis members."We've been having a dispute over the usage of water at the river for some time now. Last year, we had a similar problem where several houses were burnt down since some people did not want others to access the river," Munke said.Read: Disarm Trans Mara residents as guns were used in clashes, MP urges stateAlso read: Firearms used in Trans Mara clashes sourced from Tanzania, traders claimThe incident came shortly after area leaders and security officials met to resolve previous incidents of violence where six people have been killed at Esiot, Murkan Junction and Kirindon at the border.The meeting was attended by Narok county commissioner Mofatte Kangi, Kilgoris MP Gideon Konchellah, five MCAs and 100 elders from the two communities at the Saint Joseph Pastoral Centre in Kilgoris town.
