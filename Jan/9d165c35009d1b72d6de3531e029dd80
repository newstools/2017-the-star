Two Narok MPs have accused Deputy President William Ruto of unfairly favouring Governor Samuel Tunai and supporting his reelection.Narok West legislator Patrick Ntutu and his Emurua Dikirr counterpart Johana Ng&rsquo;eno on Saturday said the DP should be fair and not play favourites. Ntutu wants to unseat Tunai and is seeking the Jubilee Party ticket in the primaries. &ldquo;The DP is stooping too low. He should have shown impartiality by calling all the leaders to his Karen and Sugoi homes, instead of allowing one group to bring the leaders so that they can air their views,&rdquo; the MP said.Ntutu said the DP was wrong to tell the Kipsigis to back Tunai. &ldquo;The DP should be a unifying factor. If he continues this way, we will rethink our stand in Jubilee and defect,&rdquo; he said.Ntutu gave the Jubilee leaders 14 days to &ldquo;rectify what the DP has done.&rdquo;Ng&rsquo;eno told Tunai to stop using the Kipsigis community in Narok to divide residents. He said the Kipsigis and the Maasais have lived peacefully for a long time. &ldquo;The governor has failed to initiate development and has sensed defeat. He wants to use the DP to get reelected, but residents are wise,&rdquo; he said. Ng&rsquo;eno said Kenyans will choose leaders with strongdevelopment track records. &ldquo;The DP should know the Kipsigis in Narok will not vote blindly,&rdquo; he said.Yesterday, county communications director Oliver Mwenda said Tunai has never engaged in tribal politics. He said the governor has been advocating peace and &ldquo;malicious remarks by politicians have no place in the county.&rdquo;
