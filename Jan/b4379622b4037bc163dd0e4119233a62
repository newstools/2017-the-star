ODM yesterday announced it will start primaries from February 4.Chairman John Mbadi said the party&rsquo;s National Elections Board is finalising the schedule. ODM has promised to restore confidence in the primaries previously marred by chaos and hooliganism, especially in party strongholds.The party has clustered regions into orange, grey and red, based on support levels. Grey areas are regions where the party&rsquo;s support equals those of rival parties, red includes areas the party does not enjoy as much support as Jubilee, while orange represents the party&rsquo;s strongholds.Mbadi said a &ldquo;scientific or carefully crafted method&rdquo; will be used to identify strong candidates for grey regions, while direct nomination will be used in red regions where competing parties have more support. &ldquo;We will use universal suffrage in areas where we have strong support in which getting a ticket will be like getting representatives,&rdquo; Mbadi told the Star in a phone interview.&ldquo;NEB is under instructions to start with areas where we expect to give direct nominations from February 4 so the rest of the areas where we will conduct competitive nominations are staggered from April,&rdquo; he added. Mbadi said preliminary reports from the NEB on the submission of applications by aspirants is impressive. The deadline was pushed from December 31 last year to January 10. &ldquo;We are satisfied we have done better than 2013,&rdquo; Mbadi said. He assured supporters nominations will be free and fair. There have been claims by some aspirants that national party officials have refused to resign because they intend to award themselves direct nominations.
