Technical University of Mombasa has been ordered to compensate former Vice Chancellor Josphat Mwatelah for unfair dismissal.The VC was suspend last year February by Education CS Fred Matiang'i on grounds of integrity and maladministration. The don's 5-year contract that ran from 2013 was later terminated in May vide a letter from then PS Higher Education Collette Suda.The letter directed TUM council to investigate allegations of fraudulent activities by senior staff.Judge Onesmus Makau of Labor Relations Court at Mombasa on Friday said Mwatelah should receive all his dues and benefits from February.Though not reinstated, Mwatelah will also receive another 12-month salary, a period he would have served as the VC."TUM will also clear his suit cost plus interest that might have accrued," the judge said on Friday when he made a ruling on the matter.Makau said: "Within 30 days from Friday, January 27, Mwatelah should calculate the accumulated interest and dues he is set to receive from his former employer,"Before he was sacked, TUM university council found Mwatelah guilty of eight out of 10 charges leveled against him.Four council members voted that he should receive stern warning and then resume work but three members were of contrary opinion."For unknown reasons, the three council members went ahead and wrote a dissenting opinion to Matiang'i," Makau said."Matiang'i acted on the dissenting opinion of minority to terminate the contract of the former VC," the judge said.The judge said the CS ought not to have sacked Mwatelah because most council members found no ground to have him dismissed.The judge said the CS lacks powers to appoint universities VCs and therefore he cannot terminate their contracts."One who appoints has all rights to sack," he said, citing the university council as the only organ with the mandate to end the contract of their staff.He said such can only be done if they have compelling and proven grounds for dismissal.The Education CS usually appoints five of eight members of the council, and therefore should have dealt with Mwatelah's matter."It is was an illegal punishment because the CS had no knowledge of contract between the claimant (Mwatelah) and TUM," Makau said."By terminating the claimant's contract, the CS had illegally descended from his throne of rendering advise or policy guidance to the council," he said.Makau said TUM council failed to handle Mwatelah's case fairly by ratifying a decision by the CS to have the former VC sacked.The judge said this was so despite the council wielding all powers to make such key decision."TUM council... remained aloof... instead of rising to the occasion and state her mandate under the law, her charter, her statutes and contract of employment between her and the claimant," Makau said.During the hearing in November, Mwatelah's lawyer Habert Ashiruma said his client was 'sacrificed' because he did not award a tender to a company linked to one Kibet Lang&rsquo;at.Lang'at, the court was told, is a director general of the Technical and Vocational Education and Training Authority.Ashiruma said Suda had directed Mwatelah to award the Sh50 million tender for construction of two technical training institutes in Kinango and Lungalunga to Lang&rsquo;at&rsquo;s company.The lawyer said his client acted on the recommendation of the Technical, Financial and Evaluation Committee which found Lang&rsquo;at's company unsuitable.Read: Sacked Mombasa VC wants job back, says council did not terminate servicesAlso read: Former TUK vice chancellor Mwatela was rightfully dismissed, says CS Matiang&rsquo;i
