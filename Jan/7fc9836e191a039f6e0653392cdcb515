Ford Kenya deputy party leader Boni Khalwale has said leader Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula has no problem with Trans Nzoia Governor Patrick Khaemba, suspended by party officials for being close to D William Ruto.He said the governor is a loyal and committed member of the party. Khalwale said Wetang&rsquo;ula has no differences with Khaemba.&ldquo;At the headquarters, we have no problem with Khaemba. In fact, in the last two meetings of top party organs he was very involved and ensured the forums were a success,&rdquo; the Kakamega senator said.He said the party has not received official complaints from its Trans Nzoia branch against Khaemba.&ldquo;We have only read what they are saying in the media, but if we formally get the complaints, then we will address the matter,&rdquo; Khalwale said. Branch officials who suspended Khaemba said he is closer to Ruto than Wetang&rsquo;ula.But the governor has downplayed the suspension. He says the party has structures in place and and procedures to follow in case a member is to be kicked out. &ldquo;I am a faithful and loyal member of the party and its members should not think I am in office to serve them alone. As governor, I have to serve all the residents of Trans Nzoia county,&rdquo; Khaemba said.He said he only relates with the DP on official matters in their capacities, as do all other governors. Two interim party officials, Edward Munabi and James Wambisi, said Khaemba has failed to adhere to party policies and ideology.
