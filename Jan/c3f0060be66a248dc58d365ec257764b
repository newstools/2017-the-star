Governor Hassan Joho yesterday said he kicked out state-provided security officers because they had been sent to plant illegal &ldquo;substances&rdquo; and guns at his home &mdash; and incriminate him.The Mombasa county boss yesterday alleged the same security detail that was to guard him had been ordered to spy on him and disclose his movements.He said this would have made it easy to frame and arrest him, forcing his supporters to pour into the streets to demand justice.Joho spoke at Treasury Square Garden during the launch of the mass voter registration.Sources in Vigilance House told the Star Joho lost his security because they failed to provide intelligence about the governor to authority. Therefore, the plan was to replace them with those willing to spy and play ball with the state.The governor has moved to a residence at an undisclosed location and hired his own security.He said the authority branded an innocent man an al Shabaab operative and put a bounty on his head, only to announce he is innocent.Some Administration Police assigned to guard Joho&rsquo;s former residence were chased away by the new occupant.The governor denied involvement in illicit drug trade, saying the state is building a narrative to suit its agenda.Regional coordinator Nelson Marwa said police are investigating possible links between Joho and alleged illicit drug business by a man said to be his relative, Ibrahim Khatri.Marwa questioned why Joho was determined to free a &ldquo;potential drug baron&rdquo;.The ODM deputy leader said a state agent whom he failed to name is linking every conversation to drug deals to tarnish his name.&ldquo;I believe the Jubilee administration is giving more powers to drug barons to transact businesses and not targeting the real culprits,&rdquo; Joho said.Mvita MP Abdulswamad Nassir said drug abuse has been politicised during the Jubilee regime.&ldquo;If Joho is who you say he is, why have you not arrested him?&rdquo; he asked. The MP addressed supporters aslongside Joho.The governor questioned why the state is not closing down well-known drug dens in Mombasa if it is genuinely fighting the drug menace that has claimed many lives. &ldquo;If you have good-will, close Magodoroni, Godown, Mikanjuni and others,&rdquo; he said.The governor denied 100,000 Mombasa residents are drug addicts, saying the figures are inflated to suit a political agenda. Meanwhile, Marwa issued an alert and said raids will be carried out to seize illicit guns.He also said operations are underway to arrest drug kingpins. Marwa said two were arrested in Lamu and Mombasa.
