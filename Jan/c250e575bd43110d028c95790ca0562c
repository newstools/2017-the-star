Kenya Airways will work with Australia&rsquo;s largest airline Qantas Airways to export 30 tons of Kenyan cut flowers to the Asian-Pacific country every month.In a statement on Thursday, KQ said the new service was informed by a market research that identified Sydney and Melbourne as key markets for the product. "KQ Cargo is targeting the move as part of revenue improvement in the ongoing 'Operation Pride'," said Cargo sales manager Patricia Odida.Read: KQ makes Sh900m operating profit, six-month net loss down to Sh4.78 billionOdida also noted that Kenya Airways' flourishing relationship with the Australian airline enabled the success of the new service, through Johannesburg, into Sydney and Melbourne."This is a major game changer for Kenya, in terms of increasing trade exports of flowers to nontraditional markets. This partnership opens up the Australian market for exporters and is a business opportunity for us to generate revenue," she said."Previously, exporters relied on other carriers, but when we got into an interline agreement with Qantas, we have seen the market grow and demand is steadily increasing. We are now working on an additional gateway through Bangkok," Odida said.She added that KQ Cargo will continue to pursue more opportunities in the fast-growing flower business in the Far East countries including China."The company recently fired 38 staff members as part of Operation Pride, whose goals are to increase profits and return focus to its business model," according to CEO Mbuvi Ngunze.Read: Kenya Airways fires 38 more in bid to make profitsAccording to the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics, Kenya's earnings from horticulture exports rose 20 per cent to 77.81 billion shillings ($766 million) in the first nine months of 2016.The data shows flower exports contributed Sh53.88 billion or 69 per cent of the earnings, with the rest coming from the export of fruits and vegetables.
