Jubilee Party coordinator Joseph Mathai has termed former TNA secretary general Onyango Oloo a "hypocrite" over Jubilee rigging remarks.Mathai, the former executive director of TNA, said Oloo has no evidence.&ldquo;Oloo was only dealing with agendas or manifestos of development and not votes. He was not in the kitchen of the party. If he was, then maybe he would have been allowed to clean the kitchen, not cook the food,&rdquo; he said on Saturday in Nyeri town&ldquo;Let him not cheat Raila Odinga by causing side shows. After all, he stopped being the secretary general of the party on September 9, 2015. He has since remained as ordinary member. He did not add votes in the party,&rdquo; Mathai said.He urged Oloo to stop making reckless remarks and instead concentrate on his ODM new party.Early last week, Oloo defected to ODM party and threatened to spill beans on how the Jubilee Party planned to rig the last general election.
