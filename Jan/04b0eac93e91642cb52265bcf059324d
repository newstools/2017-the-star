Two Kajiado Jubilee Party governor hopefuls, Daniel Nina and Tarayia ole Kores, have joined forces to lock out Joseph ole Lenku in the primaries. The JP nominations will be in April.The two struck the deal on Thursday night in Ongata Rongai town, Kajiado North subcounty, after Lenku allegedly refused to agree on a mode of picking one of them to fly the party's flag on August 8.Already, five candidates are seeking the JP ticket to run against the incumbent, David Nkedianye of ODM. The aspirants present at the Ongata Rongai meeting were Kores, Nina and George King&rsquo;ori.Lenku and Moses Parantai refused to attend, saying they would rather go through the nominations. It was agreed Kores would run for governor with Nina as his running mate while King&rsquo;ori was promised he would be appointed Trade executive.Yesterday Nina and Kores told the Star they have decided whom they will support for senator, woman representative, MP and MCA.Meanwhile, President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto have invited 2,500 JP aspirants from Kajiado for a meeting at State House.Insiders say top on the agenda will be picking a popular aspirant to face off with Nkedianye.Kores is said to be most popular in the vote-rich Kajiado East, North and South constituencies, where diaspora votes are more than those held by the local communities. Nkedianye enjoys the Maasai votes, which are less than 40 per cent of total votes in the county. He will be banking on the Kisii, Luhya, Kamba and Luo votes, communities that lean towards Cord.It is believed Nkedianye presents the toughest opposition ever to Jubilee in the county.
