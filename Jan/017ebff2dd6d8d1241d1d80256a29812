The proposed Kenya Integrated Election Management System (KIEMS) will seek to avoid over-voting at the polling station level, a document seen by the Star show.The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission invited bids for the system as part of the fulfilment of new electoral laws.The document by IEBC shows that transparent, secure, verifiable, reliable and highly available during voter registration, candidate registration, voter verification and results transmission exercises.The system being sought is to integrate the existing biometric voter registration, the biometric voter identification, the electronic results transmission and the political party and candidate registration systems.The IEBC says that system must have an integration of the Biometric Voter Register and the Candidate Registration System, which are both currently separate."This is for verification of votes cast i.e. Votes cast should not be more that the registered voters of a polling station," the IEBC explains in the document.The System should register eligible voters using biometrics (finger prints, facial image or rris), Identify voters during the voting day and verification day and be available during the Election Day to perform all tasks of the election as may be required.It is also supposed to electronically transmit the provisional results in an efficient, secure and transparent manner and scan and send images of result forms.The system IEBC is seeking should also register candidates and integrate with the existing biometric voter registration system seamlessly.The IEBC Document shows that one of the key features of the results transmission system is that it should be downloadable and easily configured into a modern hardware equipment.It must also have an interface to authenticate presiding officers and an input interface for capturing votes per candidates in various elective positions.It must be integrated with the current Candidate Registration System and the Biometric Voter Register.IEBC also says that the system must securely transmit the results over telecommunication network to IEBC servers for consolidation and publication.The system that IEBC is seeking to have will also automate the nomination process of candidates to "increase efficiency, effectiveness and accuracy of the process"."The key objectives are registration of candidate details such as Name, ID, Portrait, Race, Political party&rsquo;s data, symbols and integrate with BVR system in order to verify valid supporters," the IEBC document states.Other objectives of the system are to integrate with the Political Parties Database to verify registered party members as well as capture all mandatory requirements as stipulated in the law.This system should also be able to allow for the independent generation of ballot paper proofs and posters for verification before ballot printing.The identified vendor will have 60 days for manufacturing, assembly and delivery lead-times to the IEBC warehouse.The next step will be the installation, testing and configuration procedures, processes with responsibility matrix.This will be followed with systems integration, configuration, customization and change management.After this the process will move to data export from the central system and import onto all the electronic devices indicating the timelines, infrastructure or other components required (within 2 weeks).The IEBC and the supplier will carry out a joint inspection and testing to confirm that each device is in working condition as supplied upon delivery.The second phase is election which will involve equipment preparation, testing, training, and support for the supplied solution. This will include the electronic system setup and configuration to ensure that the right data is copied accurately to the correct system.Proposed data preparation, data conversion, data migration and testing processes prior to the election day.The vendor will also work with IEBC on logistics and equipment deployment to ensure that the right hardware goes to the right polling station.Other aspects are access and security management; reliability and availability management; Election Day diagnostics and support as well as device backup and support in case of failure of primary system.
