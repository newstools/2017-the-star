Selestine Ajiambo said her husband Anaclet Juma had gone to take a bath on Thursday in their makeshift bathroom when he saw the snake. He tried to kill it, but it hid in the grass.Juma then set the bathroom on fire. Then the wind picked up and the fire spread to their grass-thatched house. Ajiambo said she was tending to her sick daughter, a student at Mundere Girls Secondary School, when she heard her husband calling for help. She told the Star on Saturday she almost lost her life when their sofa got stuck on the door as her husband and neighbours tried to salvage it. One of their daughters was to join form one.
