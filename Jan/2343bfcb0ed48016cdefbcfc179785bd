The Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital has offered a 50 per cent waiver on pending bills by patients who owe the hospital more than Sh200 million. CEO Wilson Aruasa said all outstanding bills up to December 31, 2016, and the waiver is valid from January 16 to March 3 to enable patients collect their documents.The hospital is still holding more than 25,000 IDs, title deeds and logbooks, among other documents, used as security by patients who were unable to pay bills.Last year the hospital wrote off more than Sh100 million debts through a similar waiver. The hospital was then holding more than 34,000 IDs and other documents.Aruasa said the hospital is involved in a campaign to have many people enrol with the National Hospital Insurance Fund.&ldquo;Once we have many people enrolled with the NHIF they will not have problems paying some of the bills,&rdquo; he said.More than 200,000 ID cards are being held by private and public hospitals in the North Rift over unpaid medical bills.Some women leaders have asked the government to intervene and ensure the IDs are released so the owners can register to vote.Political activist Janet Koech said, "Many people will miss out on the registration of voters which starts on Monday and it&rsquo;s important that the government helps to have the hospitals release the IDs."She added that any men also keep their wives' IDs and other documents.Women must also be empowered to make their own decisions in politics instead of being influenced by men, Koech said.
