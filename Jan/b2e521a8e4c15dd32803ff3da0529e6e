Goma Lotto, the newest betting and lottery company to be licensed in Kenya, was launched on Friday evening in Nairobi.The company is a brainchild of Gor Mahia FC and its proceeds will primarily be channeled to the welfare of players and technical bench of Kenya&rsquo;s most successful football outfit.This will be Gor Mahia&rsquo;s supplementary source of revenue that will cushion the club financially and keep their activities running.The chief executive officer of Goma Lotto, Dorothy Liech, promised that her company is going to shake up the betting and gaming industry in Kenya.&ldquo;We are not just going to be the biggest betting company, but we are going to revolutionize the betting and lottery in Kenya,&rdquo; noted Liech.With Goma Lotto, betting enthusiasts will be able to bet with cash in multiples of Sh20 on Short Mobile Service text platform only. One can enroll by texting the word &lsquo;Win&rsquo; to the number 29055. Whereas other betting companies hold jackpots twice a week at atleast Sh80, Goma Lotto&rsquo;s jackpot will be held after every 30 minutes starting 6.30am to 9.30pm daily at Sh20.&ldquo;Goma Lotto primarily focuses to support the youth in sports and Gor Mahia is the most organised youth group so we had to start with them. This is not to say that we are limited to supporting Gor Mahia only. We will engage with other sporting clubs and teams across the country too,&rdquo; she added.Top on their short term goals will be to buy a bus for the team and enrol both the players and the technical bench in medical covers. Goma Lotto&rsquo;s long term goals are to set up an academy, build a clubhouse and construct a modern stadium for the club.Anjie Owande, the company&rsquo;s chief marketing manager however, clarified that as they look to put up an academy for Gor in a year&rsquo;s time, the profits made will determine the timings.&ldquo;We might have the Academy up and running in less than a year or even over the 12 months, all this will depend on the revenue collected,&rdquo; intimated Owande.Gor Mahia Chairman Ambrose Rachier said: &ldquo;Our biggest concern is the welfare of the playing and technical units, and part of the proceeds of Goma Lotto will be channeled to procuring medical covers for them. Later, other facets of their welfare will be addressed,&rdquo;Meanwhile, Gor also unveiled their 14 new signings during the launch.
