Wrangles in the Nyamira County Assembly intensified on Tuesday following the removal of minority leader Jackson Mogusu.Mogusu, Nyansiongo MCA, was replaced by Rigoma&rsquo;s Benson Sironga.This comes five days after the Budget and Appropriation committee was dissolved by speaker Joash Nyamoko.Minority Whip Nyameino Atuti said Mogusu was removed because he had frustrated Jubilee&rsquo;s agenda in the assembly.Last week, Nyamoko dissolved the committee accusing the chairman James Sabwengi of undermining him. Mogusu was a member of the dissolved committee.He was among MCAs who on Friday last week opposed a motion to form a committee to investigate implementation of projects and the proposed supplementary appropriations.However, the majority had their way, the committee was formed and given two weeks to table its report.Speaking to the Star on phone Tuesday, Mogusu said the decision to sack him was unprocedural."First of all, I have heard it from your fellow journalists. They did not follow procedure in purporting to remove me from office," he said."I was not even invited to the meeting to defend myself," Mogusu, who was elected on a defunct TNA ticket, added.He said since all minority MCAs were elected on parties which have been dissolved, he will remain the minority leader until his term in office expires."There is a lot of confusion in the assembly but sanity will prevail in the next two weeks. It is just a matter of time," he said.He said that the speaker acted illegally when he dissolved the budget committee.Contacted, Nyamoko said he has not received official communication from the group of MCAs regarding the Mogusu's ouster"Standing Orders require the party chief whip to present to me formal record of minutes and resolutions on the removal of the official," the speaker said."So far I have not received the communication in an official manner and when it will come, we will have to do according to the House Standing Orders," Nyamoko said.
