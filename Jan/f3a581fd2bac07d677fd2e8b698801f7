The only way Cord can be assured of Kamba&rsquo;s support is by naming Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka as its presidential flagbearer, Yatta MP Francis Mwangangi said yesterday.He said it will be difficult for the opposition to convince the community to support it if Kalonzo is not the presidential candidate.&ldquo;I highly doubt that the community is ready to back someone else other than Kalonzo. If they really care about the region&rsquo;s vote, let them make no mistake. It is as simple as having Kalonzo or else we are out,&rdquo; Mwangangi told the Star.He said among the candidates who have declared interest for presidency in Cord and in the proposed National Super Alliance, Kalonzo is the best candidate to face Jubilee.Mwangangi said Kalonzo is the only candidate, who can marshal support from all communities as he is regarded as an international peacemaker and a true statesman.&ldquo;The only man Jubilee is scared of is Kalonzo. This man is known internationally as a peacemaker and he has a national appeal of a man who is not tribal,&rdquo; he said.The Yatta MP said the community will back Jubilee, should Cord fail to name Kalonzo as its flagbearer.
