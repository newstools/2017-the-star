Janet cannot defeat me,&rdquo; Otara told the Star on the phone.Otara, who battled six hopefuls and emerged winner in the 2013 party primaries, cautioned the former ODM executive director against trying to isolate other party leaders in the county.She said this would cost ODM leader Raila Odinga a number of seats.&ldquo;She is not a party official but has been going round the county masquerading as a top party official to the chagrin of other members. She is doing a lot of damage to the party,&rdquo; Otara said.The woman representative said Ong&rsquo;era is behind a cartel of former party officials who are promising aspirants direct tickets.&ldquo;This is unfair and if not checked may cost the party a lot of seats in the county,&rdquo; Otara said.Ong&rsquo;era is said to have initially been eyeing the Senate post but changed her mind at the last minute and picked ODM nomination papers for the woman representative seat.Ong&rsquo;era dismissed Otara&rsquo;s claims as baseless and pre-emptive ahead of the primaries.&ldquo;I am just an aspirant like anyone else.
