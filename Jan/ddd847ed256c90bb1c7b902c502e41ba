A group of Jubilee Party Meru aspirants want to stop the planned branch launch on January 23 and recruitment scheduled for next week.They cite disagreements about interim branch officials.They are governor hopefuls Kilemi Mwiria and Mwenda Mbijiwe and woman representative aspirant Elizabeth Kailemia.They want President Uhuru Kenyatta to intervene and order fresh elections.They have written to the President and party headquarters.Yesterday, they said they have no faith in the abilities of interim officials to deliver credible primaries, because &ldquo;the office is controlled by the Kikali political union which has erroneously been equated with JP.&rdquo;Kikali comprises Senator Kiraitu Murungi, woman representative Florence Kajuju and senator aspirant and Igembe South MP Mithika Linturi.Kiraitu is the head of the JP Meru branch.Kikali has been accused of micromanaging the branch.Yesterday, Linturi said Mwiria, Mbijiwe and Kailemia are &ldquo;cowards&rdquo;, afraid to face off with rivals at the nominations.He said Kikali has used a lot of its own resources to invest in the Jubilee Party, &ldquo;unlike many aspirants who claim to be affiliated to the party, yet they have nothing to show for it&rdquo;.&ldquo;Cowards die many times before their actual death. If they are afraid to face us at the nominations stage, they can as well quit. The Jubilee Party is very strong in Meru and we have no doubt that even if they left we will still remain strong,&rdquo; Linturi said.Kikali group allies pickedDuring county elections last month, close allies of Kikali were picked forpowerful positions.The secretary general and chairman posts went to supporters of the former Alliance Party of Kenya led by Kiraitu.Former Meru APK chairman Joseph Muturia was elected in absentia as the branch chairman, while former APK secretary Alhaji Mwendia was picked as the secretary general.Others elected are Joshua Baariu as the organising secretary and Emily Makena as the county Jubilee Women&rsquo;s League leader.
