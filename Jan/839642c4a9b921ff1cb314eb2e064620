A new political party that seeks to change political behavior ahead of the election has been registered.The Movement for Democracy and Growth supported largely by a group of serving MPs, targets the working, middle and high classes.Party secretary general Linus Opiyo yesterday said these people do not care much for politics.&ldquo;This is the party for the youthful Kenyans who want to change the style of politics and party management.The majority of the MPs behind the party may not be comfortable with their own parties and do not want to fight them but work with the party to bring change,&rdquo; he said.Opiyo said corruption and tribalism cannot be fought in a vacuum. &ldquo;We must involve those who feel, understand and experience these ills in their daily chores,&rdquo; he said.The party will be unveiled before the end of February. The party&rsquo;s three key principles are devolution, good governance and youth leadership.Opiyo said the party wants to debunk the tyranny of numbers myth in Parliament by having a few elected members committed who are faithful to their roles.He said the Movement for Democracy and Growth is already in talks with the key leaders of opposition parties.
