The low response to the ongoing mass voter registration in Nyandarua county is worrying, Public Service CS Sicily Kariuki has said.&ldquo;I want to say we have failed, head down, legs up,&rdquo; she said yesterday.Speaking to the Ol Kalou business community at ACK hall in the town, Kariuki said only 20,000 out of the 257,000 eligible voters in Nyandarua have registered to vote.This is less than 10 per cent of the unregistered adults.She urged the businesspeople to ensure every adult in Nyandarua is registered so they can vote back Jubilee on August 8 to continue enjoying the good business environment.The CS said that although Nyandarua does not suffer election-related violence, &ldquo;we have also been the victims since Nyandarua hosts the largest number of IDPs&rdquo;.A big battle awaits the Jubilee government and all its supporters, Kariuki said. &ldquo;We are going to fight. Not with guns or other weapons, but with votes,&rdquo; she said.Kariuki said Jubilee supporters will have no one to blame but themselves if they do not register to vote and the party loses in the polls.We need to secure the nation&rsquo;s future by voting, she said. &ldquo;We will sit here, lament, make noise, scream, but someone else will decide the way things are run,&rdquo; Kariuki said.
