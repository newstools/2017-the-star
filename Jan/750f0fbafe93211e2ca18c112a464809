Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto on Saturday urged the national government to ensure a peaceful election. Rutto said the manual voter registration system should not be allowed. He said biometric voter registration is efficient and transparent.&ldquo;Let the best candidates win regardless of their party affiliation, tribe, race, color or region, we don&rsquo;t want to see a PEV like situation in the coming August general election&rdquo; governor Rutto said.Governor Rutto described the then defunct Samuel Kivuitu electoral body as a shame to Kenya where results from some polling station had to take two or more days before they were announced as handlers were planning on how figures would be doctored infavour of then government preferred presidential candidate. He said with BVR system, Kenyans are assured of getting popularly elected members of county assembly (MCAs) members of the National Assembly (MPs) women representatives, senators&rsquo; governors, deputy president and the president.&ldquo;My concern is for the winning president to be a Kenyan and a person who respects democracy, rule of law and acknowledges the existence of various political parties&rdquo; Governor Rutto said.
