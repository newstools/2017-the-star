Nyali MP Hezron Awiti has said the meeting between Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho and ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi at the Serena Hotel, Mombasa, will not sway Luhya voters in the governor&rsquo;s favour.Speaking in Bokole, Changamwe, on Wednesday evening, he said only Mombasa residents, not the entire Mulembe nation, will decide on August 8 who will be their governor. Awiti said he is not scared, as he has done his homework well. &ldquo;Anybody going to seek support from outside will be surprised,&rdquo; he said.Joho and Mudavadi met to discuss NASA politics, director of communication Richard Chacha said. But ANC Coast secretary general Jimmy Azangu said the meeting was meant to secure the interests of the Luhya community in Mombasa, including an assurance for the position of speaker, two executive slots and several MCA slots. The Luhya community has been angling to get the Nyali MP seat also, with their voter strength estimated at 50,000 votes, according to ANC chairman Kelvin Lunani.Awiti has been meeting different communities, including the Taita, Bajun, Pokomo, Kamba, Luhya, businesspeople and EPZ workers.
