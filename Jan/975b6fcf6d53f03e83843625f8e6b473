Three Jubilee-compliant MPs from Western yesterday dismissed Amani leader Musalia Mudavadi and Ford Kenya chief Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula&rsquo;s agreement to work together to deliver Western votes to the opposition.They are MPs Benjamin Washiali (Mumias East), Emmanuel Wangwe (Navakholo) and Dan Wanyama (Webuye West).The Cord rebels said the agreement &ldquo;means nothing and is meant to oppress our people.&rdquo;Washiali, the Jubilee point man in Kakamega county, said the pledge will not last until the polls. He said Wetang&rsquo;ula and Mudavadi will part ways if either of them is picked as the NASA presidential flagbearer. &ldquo;If you want to join a metal to another metal or plastic to plastic, there is a particular special glue to use. The only glue to use to unite Mudavadi and Wetang&rsquo;ula is when neither of them is the leader,&rdquo; Washiali said.Wetang&rsquo;ula and Mudavadi buried the hatchet during the first joint meeting of opposition parties at the Bomas of Kenya. They said they will remain united to win the majority of votes in Western.Other Luhya legislators, including outspoken Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale and his Vihiga counterpart George Khaniri, warned leaders against divisions that could threaten &ldquo;Mulembe unity.&rdquo; &ldquo;There are people you cannot put in one basket. If one of them emerges tops, they start fighting each other the next day. We just give them one month or two and see what will come out,&rdquo; Washiali said.Wangwe said the Bomas declaration between Wetang&rsquo;ula and Mudavadi will not affect Jubilee&rsquo;s performance or deny it votes.&ldquo;Nothing has changed. What we saw at Bomas was a change in the style of dancing to the music, but the dancers remained the same. You cannot expect to do the same thing the same way for too long and expect different results,&rdquo; he said.Wanyama also rubbished the pledge and criticised the opposition for wasting their time putting Cord rebels on the spot for associating with Jubilee.&ldquo;I am shocked my fellow politicians from the opposition keep on saying we support the government because of our stomachs. Why did they also carry their tummies to the opposition?&rdquo; he said.Wanyama accused Luhya leaders in the opposition of doing &ldquo;nothing&rdquo; for residents. &ldquo;Residents are aware of the opposition&rsquo;s empty and retrogressive politics,&rdquo; he said.Political Analyst Herbert Manyora said the Mudavadi-Wetang&rsquo;ula unity could make Cord rebels lose their seats. &ldquo;The Jubilee MPs know very well they are going nowhere and are nonstarters. This is already evident by the way they are heckled in public meetings because of associating with Jubilee,&rdquo; he said.Manyora said Mudavadi and Wetang&rsquo;ula&rsquo;s unity will last.
