ANC Leader Musalia Mudavadi has asked Kenyans to vote wisely in the coming elections.In his New Year message, Musalia said the decisions Kenyans make when voting have a direct impact to their families, the society and the country at large. &ldquo;The Auditor General says &frac34; of our budget is lost to corruption. I call upon Kenyans to resolve that 2017 is the year of change. We must forge unity of purpose to reclaim our country. Kenya must return to the path of accountability, truth and justice,&rdquo; said Musalia.Musalia said the government prioritized valueless mega projects as developments programs to steal from Kenyans.&ldquo;Valueless grandiose projects have been shoved into Kenyan faces with little immediate economic value yet we are saddled with a 3.6 trillion public debt,&rdquo; said Musalia.He said the Jubilee government was not embarrassed about stealing but instead it regrets not being in power earlier or longer to enhance theft.
