President Uhuru Kenyatta has been urged to meet and reassure Jubilee Party aspirants feeling sidelined by JP leaders during his tour of Kiambu today. Ngewa MCA Karungo wa Thang'wa said Uhuru should take the opportunity to instil confidence in the aspirants and listen to their grievances, worries and expectations. "Some Kiambu leaders have been masquerading as the presidential messiahs, bundling aspirants in halls at night, hoodwinking them in the name of the President," Thang'wa said.He spoke in the ward on Wednesday during a voter registration drive. Sitting MPs have been accused of using Jubilee voter mobilisation caravans to undermine their opponents and claiming they have the President's blessings.Thang'wa urged Uhuru to visit Githunguri since neither he nor Deputy President William Ruto have ever set foot in the constituency since 2013. He said Uhuru has been to all the other 11 constituencies in Kiambu but not Githunguri.
