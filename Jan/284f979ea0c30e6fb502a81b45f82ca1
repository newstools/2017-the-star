Governors cannot account for billions of shillings given for roads maintenance, raising fears that the money could have been misappropriated.The Kenya Roads Board, a state agency, has raised the red flag that the county chiefs could have spent a staggering Sh3.3 billion to pay salaries and other expenditures and not to maintain county roads.Read: Roads board allocates Sh2.2bn to countiesSpeaking to the Star, KRB general manager Rashid Mohammed, said governors have failed to submit financial reports on the use of the money allocated in the 2015/2016 financial year."The problem we are facing is the lack of reporting by the counties on the utilisation of the conditional grants," Rashid said.This is despite efforts by the board to have the devolved units account for the billions, Rashid said.In 2015/2016 financial year, the government had allocated Sh3.3 billion for road maintenance that was distributed among the 47 counties.The allocation was however raised to Sh7.5Billion this financial year (2016/2017) but the counties had only received Sh2.2B in the first trench as at 31 Dec 2016.Rashid pointed out that the funds could probably be used for other purposes despite them being conditional grants."It is possible that some counties are applying the funds on ineligible expenditures such as developing new roads as opposed to road maintenance, and payment for unrelated county activities such as salaries, medical, motor vehicles this is against the requirements provided by when receiving a conditional grant," Rashid said.Delay in release of other fundsRashid has warned over the possible delay and holding in the disbursement of other funds if the counties are not willing to account for the expenditure of the funds."The counties and national government are required by law to report on the (Road Maintenance Levy Fund)RMLF funds in accordance with the requirements of the KRB Act and the PFM act and as they have been advised by Treasury," he said.
