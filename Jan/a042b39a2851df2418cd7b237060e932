ODM in Kajiado is divided down the middle over its choice for woman representative to run against Jubilee.During a closed meeting at a hotel in Kitengela on Sunday, county ODM bigwigs led by branch chairman Daniel Osoi settled on Esther Somoire, a close ally of President Uhuru Kenyatta.Somoire, a civil servant, had earlier supported Uhuru&rsquo;s reelection. Her about-turn to join ODM shocked JP.Osoi said, &ldquo;We have decided to front Somoire, because of her big following. We have no doubt she will deliver a lot of votes for the party.&rdquo;&ldquo;If complainers have a valid reason that a nomination is necessary, then I will do what they want,&rdquo; Osoi said,Supporters of another candidate, Simayiai Rakita, objected to Somoire, saying both must go through nomination. Rakita yesterday told the Star Osoi is playing &ldquo;monkey tricks&rdquo; to sideline her. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s unfair to pick an outsider, who has been in bed with Jubilee. We won&rsquo;t accept dictatorship, let&rsquo;s go for nomination,&rdquo; she said. Osoi argued Somoire, being from the Orok-Kiteng&rsquo; clan, will work well with Governor David Nkedianye and his Odomong&rsquo;i clan. This will help counter former Interior CS Joseph Lenku, who is Jubilee pick for governor.
