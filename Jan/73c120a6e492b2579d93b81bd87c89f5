Central Imenti MP Gideon Mwiti has disputed rumors that he has decamped from Jubilee Party and joined Peter Munya&rsquo;s PNU.In his New Year&rsquo;s message to his supporters, Mwiti said he is welcoming aspirants willing to run on the Jubilee Party ticket to sell their manifesto to the people.&ldquo;I am in Jubilee to stay and the party does not belong to a clique of people since it is a party formed after folding various parties,&rdquo; Mwiti said.He, however, said there is nothing wrong with PNU, adding that it is a party like any other, which has its own leadership and philosophy, and that he can join it like any other Kenyan.The MP urged those spreading the rumour to be cautious not to divide residents on party lines, especially in Meru county.&ldquo;I congratulate Governor Peter Munya for reviving PNU and assuming the leadership position. Everyone should note that Kenya is a multiparty state and being in a party that another person does not belong to is not an offence. It is merely a clash of ideologies,&rdquo; the MP said.While sharing the same thoughts as Munya on the need for many parties, Mwiti said those in different parties should be praised and accommodated for practising democracy.The legislator termed Kiraitu Murungi&rsquo;s quest for Meru governor a disaster in the making, because he is the one who helped Munya ascend to power. He said Kiraitu should not go against what he preached and run for Meru governor.&ldquo;If this attempt is coming from mercenaries who want to use Kiraitu to disorient the people of Meru, mess up the county and hurt the people, it is a misguided attempt,&rdquo; Mwiti said.
