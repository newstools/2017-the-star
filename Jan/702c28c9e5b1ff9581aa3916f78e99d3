Two Busia county executives are allegedly embroiled in a fight for the Trade executive position.Deputy Governor Kizito Wangalwa has allegedly refused to relinquish the docket after the reinstatement of Hillary Makhulu. Makhulu was suspended by Governor Sospeter Ojaamong in October 2015 following a resolution by the assembly over alleged misappropriation of approximately Sh43 million.The cash was meant for the revival of Muluanda Ginnery in Samia, Funyula constituency.MCAs had recommended that the Auditor General investigates.In mid-January 2016, Ojaamong shuffled executives and chief officers. Addressing journalists in his office on Monday, Makhulu said his suspension was lifted on December 19 last year after a meeting with Ojaamong.&ldquo;The moment I got back to office, I sought to know the status of ongoing projects but the deputy governor refused to hand over duties,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;The deputy governor should be man enough to accept I have been cleared. I&rsquo;m drawing a salary from the public right now and they are not getting the services they are supposed to because they do not have access to funds.&rdquo;Makhulu said cooperatives cannot access funds because of the feud. &ldquo;If we made a commitment to the people of Busia to make money available to cooperatives, we are not being fair by keeping them stranded,&rdquo; he said.Wangalwa said a letter was written to Makhulu telling him to report back to work for reassignment of duties.In a Facebook post Wangalwa said, &ldquo;The assignment of duties has not been done. The governor will assign him duties as he deems fit.&rdquo;
