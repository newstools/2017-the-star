International tourists are hesitant to travel to Kenya for the holidays this year because they fear the outcome of the August general election, industry players have said.The Kenya Association of Hotelkeepers and Caterers yesterday said 2017 bookings by foreign visitors have remained low.&ldquo;We are optimistic. But tourists appear to be cautious going by their inquiries with regard to the 2017 general election,&rdquo; KAHC Coast executive officer Sam Ikwaye told the Star on the phone. He said international tourists are concerned about the country&rsquo;s security.&ldquo;When making bookings, they are keen on their safety. Some are making references to events that followed previous elections,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If we uphold peace throughout the period and ensure safety of all, then the tourism industry will have a smooth running this year.&rdquo; However, Kenya Coast Tourism Association chairman Mohammed Hersi said the industry is stable and has recovered from previous shocks, adding they do not expect tourism slump in the run-up to the election.The sector is expected to reap big from conferences and summits scheduled to place in Nairobi this year. They include the Modern Airports Africa Conference and the Power Tech Africa Conference slated for this month, the AIDF Aid and Development Africa Summit, as well as the East Africa Islamic Economy Summit.Tourism Cabinet Secretary Najib Balala last week said the ministry will continue marketing the country as a safe destination, with a focus on traditional markets of the United States and the UK, and emerging markets which include India, China, Russia and Germany.&ldquo;In the last 17 years, the country has stood as a democratic state. Let&rsquo;s not always see 2007 as the base for the country&rsquo;s image,&rdquo; Balala said.
