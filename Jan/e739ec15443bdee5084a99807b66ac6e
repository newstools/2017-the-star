Education activist Janet Muthoni Ouko will run for Nairobi woman representative and make the post vibrant and helpful for city residents, she has said."Many people have called the woman representative seat useless, some have called us flower girls and others were even campaigning for the seat to be scrapped. But I want to assure you I will give meaning to the seat if you give me your votes," she told supporters in a Nairobi hotel yesterday.Ouko wants to run on the Jubilee Party ticket.Her main agenda is to address education concerns and make some reforms, the former director of Elimu Yetu Foundation said. More than 2.5 million people living in Nairobi are struggling to take their children to school and many students have dropped out of school as their parents cannot afford the high fees charged, she said."Students have completed their studies but cannot proceed to secondary school as they lack school fees, but as far as I am concern education is free and am ready to champion for this," Ouko said.She urged all women to unite for development, despite coming from various communities and being members of different parties."They say politics divides; I say politics divides a divided people. All we need to do is put aside all our divisions and be one to drive the agenda of development," Ouko said.
