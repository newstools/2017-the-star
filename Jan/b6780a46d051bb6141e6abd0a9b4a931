Western will not abandon the National Super Alliance, even if someone from the region is not picked as presidential flagbearer, Vihiga Senator George Khaniri said yesterday.Two leaders are eyeing the ticket &ndash; ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi and Ford Kenya&rsquo;s Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula. Khaniri said Kenyans should not be scared of Jubilee rigging the August 8 election.He said the margin of defeat will be too big to be manipulated. Not even President Moi was able to rig the 2002 election that ended Kanu&rsquo;s reign, despite having state machinery, because of the huge margin of defeat, Khaniri said.&ldquo;We will guard against rigging this time round. It will be foolish for us to be rigged out a third time. What shall we tell Kenyans?&rdquo; he said. ODM leader Raila Odinga and Wiper&rsquo;s Kalonzo Musyoka are eyeing the ticket, too.
