Battle for city supremacy has prompted both Jubilee and the opposition to map out the city and work out strategies to scoop majority of elective seats.NASA has announced it will front one candidate for every elective post, unlike in 2013 when Cord affiliate parties all had candidates for the posts &mdash; splitting the votes. Jubilee plans to use grassroots campaigns and encourage six-piece vote to wins.Six-piece voting is where a voter selects all aspirants from the same party in all the six elective posts.Nairobi has 17 constituencies and 85 wards. In 2013, Jubilee won 10 out of the 17 but later lost Mathare constituency to Cord in a by-election. All the eight opposition MPs were elected on the ODM ticket.Cord won 44 of the 85 MCAs seats, 42 elected on the ODM ticket and two on the Wiper ticket. Two ODM MCAs, South C&rsquo;s Diana Kapeen and her Viwandani counterpart Samuel Nyangwara, have defected to JP.Nairobi ODM chairman George Aladwa said Cord lost many seats in 2013 because Cord affiliate parties fielded candidates in the same post, giving Jubilee an advantage.&ldquo;We will clearly know which candidate and which party has what strength in various areas. Since we are in a coalition we will not be naive about it,&rdquo; he said.In 2013, Aladwa ran Makadara MP seat on the ODM ticket and lost to Jubilee&rsquo;s Ben Mutura by 1,700 votes.Both Wiper and ODM fielded candidates for this post and had a combined 43,600 votes against Mutura&rsquo;s 37,644.Starehe MP Maina Kamanda, JP&rsquo;s Nairobi head of campaign team, said the party is confident of flooring the opposition in the capital.&ldquo;We have the numbers and we have identified the mistakes that we need to rectify from the 2013 election,&rdquo; he said.Aladwa said the opposition is keen to win at least 13 of the 17 MP seats and 65 of the 85 MCA seats.&ldquo;Right now we are prepared to add five more seats to our current eight. Starehe, Dagoretti South, Roysambu, Kasarani is 50/50 and we are not very sure about them,&rdquo; he said.Kamanda said JP will conduct intensive grassroots campaigns and encourage six-piece voting.&ldquo;We have different strategies to win various seats in the city, among them is picking the right candidates for particular constituencies such as Dagoretti North,&rdquo; he said.Both NASA and JP have intensified voter mobilisation campaigns.Last week, ODM leader Raila Odinga camped in the city for two days urging supporters to get vote cards.He urged ODM Nairobi aspirants to be smart to outdo JP.&ldquo;Be smart, don&rsquo;t blindly mobilise people to register in areas you know we cannot win,&rdquo; Raila said.Jubilee, on the other hand, aims to scoop 15 MPs seats with the exemption of Kibra and Ruaraka, perceived as opposition strongholds.Among the constituencies targeted by Jubilee but currently represented by ODM legislators include Embakasi East, Embakasi South, Embakasi North, Lang&rsquo;ata, Westlands and Dagoretti North.There are also reports of voter transfers to the city by the two coalitions to add numbers to their respective side.
