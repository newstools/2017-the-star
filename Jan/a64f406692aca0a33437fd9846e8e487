Council of Governors chairman Peter Munya has said striking doctors are demanding a salary increase because the county governments barred them from running private clinics during working hours.He said the counties became very strict when health was devolved to ensure the doctors are always at their workstations.Munya said before then, the doctors made a lot of money working in their private clinics, when they were supposed to be attending to patients in public hospitals. He said the national and county governments have agreed to increase the doctors&rsquo; salaries, pushing up the pay of the least paid doctor to Sh199,000 per month.Munya said he is disappointed that despite the sacrifice on the government part, the doctors are adamant and are demanding a salary of more than Sh400,000 per month for the least paid doctor. He pleaded with them to stop being &ldquo;too selfish&rdquo; and mind the welfare of suffering patients. Munya said in other professions, interns are not paid. He said the money the government has offered the least paid doctor is earned by public officers in job group Q after working for more than 20 years.The Meru governor was speaking in Embu town after opening PNU offices in Kiritiri, Kianjokoma, Manyatta and Embu town on Saturday. He was with former PS Cyrus Njiru. Munya pleaded with the doctors to return to work to alleviate the suffering of patients.He said when more money is available, the doctors&rsquo; salaries would be increased further. Munya said if the doctors&rsquo; demands are implemented, the government might not have money to equip hospitals and complete other development projects.
