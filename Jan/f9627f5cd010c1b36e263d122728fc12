A week-long continental conference on fair trade practices in food processing and safeguarding the health of consumers starts in Nairobi today. The forum has been organised by United Nation&rsquo;s Food and Agriculture Organisation and World Health Organisation&rsquo;s Codex Coordinating Committee for Africa, which brings together representatives from 49 African countries.The meeting is aimed at enhancing sharing of information on food standards, Kenya Bureau of Standards managing director Charles Ongwae said in a statement. &ldquo;Our goal is to ensure we harmonise our standards as a continent while benchmarking or aligning with food standards developed by the Codex Alimentarius Commission &ndash; which are recognised by the World Trade Organisation,&rdquo; Ongwae said. Kenya was in July 2015 appointed as the CCAfrica coordinator for Africa.
