Fidelity Bank&rsquo;s shareholders raced against time to approve the proposed sale to SBM Holdings of Mauritius before end of financial year on December 31, the Central Bank said yesterday.The regulator said the struggling bottom-tier lender&rsquo;s board and shareholders okayed the deal on December 21 and 28, respectively.&ldquo;Following SBM Group&rsquo;s preparedness for the conclusion of the transaction at the earliest, with necessary capital infusion, FCBL held a board meeting on December 21, 2016, and then an Extraordinary General Meeting of shareholders on December 28, 2016 where the transaction was discussed and approved,&rdquo; the CBK said in a statement yesterday. The go-ahead by the privately owned bank paves the way for signing of a share purchase agreement between the two companies &ldquo;in the near future&rdquo;, the regulator said.The agreement will then be presented to the regulators in Kenya and Mauritius for approval before the acquisition is sealed. The completion of the deal will enable SBM, a giant financial services groups listed on the Stock Exchange of Mauritius, to finally enter the Kenyan market after apparently failing on three previous attempts.The Mauritius financial services firm is said to have failed to get a permit for direct entry after the CBK slapped an indefinite suspension of new licences on November 17, 2015. The regulator, however, left the door open for mergers and acquisitions.Insiders have said that SBM was among the eight lenders which had expressed interest in acquiring mid-tier Chase Bank when it was placed under receivership on April 7.Other sources have also indicated that SBM was also keen on collapsed Imperial Bank in the early days of its October 13, 2015, receivership, but later cooled its interest.&ldquo;SBM Group will bring its experience and expertise from Mauritius and other markets, to enhance competitiveness and the resilience of Kenya&rsquo;s banking sector,&rdquo; the CBK said yesterday. &ldquo;SBM Group is pursuing an international expansion strategy; and for the African region, it is anchored on Kenya as the entry point for Eastern Africa.&rdquo;
