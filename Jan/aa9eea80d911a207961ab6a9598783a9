Former Football Kenya Federation (FKF) president Sam Nyamweya has urged Kenyans and well wishers to contribute towards the launch of Joe Kadenge Foundation.He said the foundation will cater for other retired sports legends who can&rsquo;t make their ends meet.Speaking after visiting the ailing soccer legend at the Nairobi&rsquo;s Meridien Hospital, Nyamweya said he is ready to take full charge by starting the fund kitty assisted by sharp minded personalities like Sam Sholei and Mathare United Bob Munro.He said it was pointless to blame the Government for the suffering facing Kadenge and other retired legends since they have other vital priorities aimed at developing the country.Nyamweya said the money can be saved in a fixed deposit account, where the interest will be used by Kadenge and those concerned to boost their crucial daily upkeep.The former football guru, however urged politics to be kept aside since this is like a charitable organisation that requires no political interference. &ldquo;We should not wait or expect the Government to do everything for us. We should start from somewhere so that the Government can only chip in. Let us start the Kadenge Foundation so that we can open a better fertile ground for our sports heroes who made a mark in one way or another.This foundation will change the life&rsquo;s of many sportsmen. I believe that being together this festive season will make Mzee Kadenge recover faster,&rdquo; observed Nyamweya.Sam Sholei, who accompanied Nyamweya echoed the same sentiments, adding that he was ready to chip in and mobilise funds for the kitty.Sholei, who is credited for launching a special What&rsquo;s-up group that is trending heavily towards raising money for the ailing Kadenge said there was need to start a sports lottery or a betting online, where sports men will bet their money and hence boost the kitty. &ldquo;Let us show a kind heart and share whatever little we have to our sports legends, who have given Kenya a good image,&rdquo; Sholei said. A major funds drive towards Kadenge&rsquo;s medical expenses is slated for January 6th at the Nairobi Railway club from 6pm.
