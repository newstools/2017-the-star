The Interior ministry has said Kalonzo Musyoka lied that his ID card number was being used by a woman in Wajir county.Spokesperson Mwenda Njoka said on Thursday that the National Registration Bureau has no record of a person with the same number as the Wiper leader's."We wish to make it unequivocally clear that the bureau has absolutely nothing to do with the registration of voters and only registers and issues Kenyans with IDs," he said.&ldquo;We also wish to point out that Salome Wanjiru Njoroge's ID number is different from that of the former VP and that he is registered under a different ID, with records showing he was born in Gatundu North on April 10, 1993. His ID was issued in December 2012."He said the department's records show Kalonzo's ID was issued on January 31, 1996, to replace a lost one.Njoka also slammed Kalonzo for claiming the NRB was being used to play dirty tricks to rig the 2017 polls.Kalonzo said the revelation was clear evidence of a wider scheme to rig the August 8 general election in favour of Jubilee."This [also] explains why the Registrar of Persons has retained office several years after attaining the retirement age," he said."We in Cord shall now allow such machinations to happen."More on this: Kalonzo accuses IEBC of rigging as his ID is listed to woman in WajirThe IEBC said the issue may have resulted from data entry errors at the point of registration or genuine sharing of ID numbers."As we establish how this mix-up occurred, please note there are several cases of shared IDs in the register of voters&rsquo; database," said communication manager Andrew Limo.He added: "The commission has been in touch with the bureau on potential ID duplicates."The commission assured Kenyans that legitimately registered voters cannot be disenfranchised since they will be identified using biometric features on voting day.The IEBC said a month-long inspection of the voter register will clean the register and correct errors.Also read: No cause for alarm over Kalonzo 'double ID' listing, IEBC says
