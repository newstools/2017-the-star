MPs on Tuesday called for peaceful campaigns ahead of the August 8 vote as the election fever gripped the August House on its first day after long recess.The eleventh Parliament, on its last lap of this year's sessions, also dwelt on fears of quorum hitches amid concerns that the situation might cripple crucial bills.While members were supposed to approve key House Business Committees, they were more vocal on calls for tranquility ahead of the scheduled poll.Some members declared to the members the seats that they intend to fight for during the election, citing that the busy schedules might affect House attendance.Minority Whip Thomas Mwadeghu (Wundanyi MP) and Johnson Sakaja (nominated) informed their colleagues of their Taita Taveta and Nairobi governor bids respectively.Mwadeghu said available records show that in every election circle, only at least 20 per cent of MPs successfully manage to come back to the House."As many as 80 per cent of us will not be here. I wish you well for those will make it here but for me I am going to seek a higher office," he said."There are those who will not come on purpose, but there are others who will not come by the will of the people," Sakaja said."As we move towards election, let us not raise political tensions in the country. Let us remember that at the end of the day we are one," Sakaja added. Olago Aluoch of Kisumu West warned his colleagues that 70 per cent of them will not come back to Parliament.He cited misuse of Constituency Development funds as a key reasons for the trend of leaders only serving a single term.Olago used the opportunity to drum support for his re-election bid, arguing that his constituency was ranked among the best in the use of the funds.Read: MPs to resume for last session, few likely to be present"As we approach this session, we must be aware of the need to educate Kenyans to vote and to vote wisely," Olago said."Those who talk the loudest are the ones whose constituencies are lagging behind in voter registration," the lawmaker said.Dan Maanzo(Makueni) said: "Quorum hitches are likely to be experienced in the remaining period. For those seeking higher seats, live your dreams,"Bobasi MP Stephen Manoti urged his colleagues to be ambassadors of peace during the campaigns to avoid the country sliding back to anarchy."It is our duty to make sure peace all over to avoid the 2007 post election violence which was caused by the loose mouths of politicians," he said.Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi warned the executive against trying to bypass the House in budget making "as is often the case during an election year"."This House is the only institution with sole mandate to determine the budget, unfortunate that the executive through the Treasury wants to arm-twist this House by asking officers not to appear before committee," he said.
