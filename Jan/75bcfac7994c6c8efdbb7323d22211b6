Parliament yesterday unanimously approved the nomination of seven IEBC candidates, paving way for their swearing in.The House concurred with National Assembly&rsquo;s Justice and Legal Affairs Committee report, endorsing the hiring of Wanyonyi Chebukati as IEBC chairman and six other nominees as commissioners.&ldquo;Pursuant to the provisions of the Public Appointments (Parliamentary Approval) Act, 2012, the IEBC Act and Standing Order 216-5 of the National Assembly, the committee recommends the House approve the nomination of Wafula Chebukati (chairman), members Paul Kurgat, Boya Molu, Abdi Guliye, Kwamboka Akombe, Margaret Mwachanya and Consolata Nkatha for appointment by His Excellency the President,&rdquo; reads a report by the Samuel Chepkonga-led committee.The committee in endorsing Chebukati said he has the required qualifications and experience.&ldquo;Chebukati, according to the records and information made available to the committee, has never been implicated in any issues that may lead to a conclusion of lack of integrity on his part,&rdquo; the report reads.During vetting, Chebukati assured the committee that he will maintain fairness and be non-partisan in managing elections, despite his initial association with Cord leader Raila Odinga&rsquo;s ODM. He unsuccessfully ran for Saboti MP on the ODM ticket in 2007.He said he no longer belongs to any political party, having returned his life membership certificate.The committee held that none of the other six nominees has integrity questions. It said they exhibited &ldquo;impressive knowledge&rdquo; on administration and management principles needed to resolve the problems facing the IEBC.Baringo North MP William Cheptumo urged the House and all political players to support the new IEBC team to avert mistrust, as the commission discharges its constitutional duties. &ldquo;The seven Kenyans are going to ensure citizens exercise their sovereign power of electing their leaders. They have the right vision, experience and expertise to oversee the next election,&rdquo; he said. Kajiado Central MP Memusi Kanchori opposed the nomination of Chebukati.
