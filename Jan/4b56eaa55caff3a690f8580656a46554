Kericho Kanu chairman William Kettienya yesterday backed national chairman Gideon Moi&rsquo;s call for President Uhuru Kenyatta to speak directly to the Kalenjin community without involving DP William Ruto.He said the Kalenjin have no problem with Uhuru, but with Ruto, whom he said is cruel, harsh and unforgiving. Addressing journalists in Kericho town yesterday, Kettienya termed as outdated Ruto&rsquo;s combative politics against Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto. Kettienya told Ruto to borrow a leaf from Central Kenya people, who have supported Uhuru for a long time, the same way the Luhya community in Western has supported Musalia Mudavadi. &ldquo;As DP, what efforts has Ruto made to reconcile with Rutto and MPs Alfred Keter,Oscar Sudi, Johana Ng&rsquo;eno and Zakayo Cheruiyot?&rdquo; Kettienya said.
