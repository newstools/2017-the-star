New anti-corruption agency boss Eliud Wabukala yesterday said he will hold top government officials personally accountable on graft issues.He said those in leadership positions, especially the Cabinet secretaries, PSs, CEOs and governors, must take responsibility and be held answerable for what happens in their departments.Wabukala appealed to judges and magistrates to impose harsh sentences on those convicted of corruption to deter others. &ldquo;I call upon magistrates who hear the criminal corruption cases to impose deterrent sentences on those who are convicted; as this is critical if the war on corruption is to be won; and it is my belief it will be with God&rsquo;s help and our determination,&rdquo; he said.Wabukala, who was sworn into office yesterday, is the retired Anglican Archbishop. He replaces former Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission chairman Philip Kinisu.Wabukala urged the public and faith groups to join the war on corruption, saying they should stop watching from the sidelines. Kinisu resigned while he was being investigated for his alleged connections with Esaki Limited, which was paid part of the National Youth Service scandal money.Chief Justice David Maraga urged the EACC boss to ensure his team brings to court well-investigated cases, which will ease the work of the courts. He warned that if they bring shoddy work his judges and magistrates will not shy away from saying as much and in the event there is no evidence they will have no choice but to acquit.He was quick to remind the retired primate his new office is one that has acquired the name &ldquo;cursed office&rdquo;, with the highest turnover of executives in the public service.&ldquo;As a man of faith, I am sure that you know the tenurial security that the Constitution may offer is nowhere close to the tenurial security and comfort of God&rsquo;s providence,&rdquo; the CJ said. The CJ advised the EACC boss not to underestimate the power of the corrupt to fight back by using every trick in the book to stall the commission&rsquo;s efforts.
