The Central Bank sold dollars in the foreign exchange market on Wednesday after the shilling weakened due to heavy importer demand from sectors like energy, traders said. At about 10.23am, commercial banks quoted the shilling at 103.10/20 to the dollar, compared with Tuesday&rsquo;s close of 102.80/103.00.The shilling last traded at its present levels in mid-October 2015, when it hit a low of 103.50/60 on October 13. &ldquo;Markets weakened and then we have seen Central Bank in the market. It has reduced the pace of the shilling&rsquo;s depreciation. There is high demand,&rdquo; said a senior trader at one commercial bank.The CBK rarely comments on dollar sales. Foreign exchange reserves in the last week of 2016 dropped 0.75 per cent to a multi-month low of $6.971 billion (about Sh716.69 billion).
