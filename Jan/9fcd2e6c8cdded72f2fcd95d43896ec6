Milk processor Brookside has announced it will pay farmers three shillings more for each kilo of milk delivered to the plant. The move, which takes effect tomorrow, sets a fresh battle for the control of raw milk market.The price increase comes on the back of ravaging drought that has hit major milk producing zones.&ldquo;This is an incentive meant to cushion farmers from the effects of adverse weather experienced in the country over the past two months. It will help farmers to recover their milk production costs, and enable them to prepare adequately to grow and conserve feeds as we approach the long rains,&rdquo; general Manager milk procurement and extension services John Gethi said yesterday. He said the increase will apply to all its contracted raw-milk suppliers. Some milk companies pay differentiated prices for raw milk, with varying rates for different counties. Gethi termed the price increase a show of commitment by the firm to farmers. Last year, Brookside paid a Sh10 billion to farmers from milk delivered.The move by Brookside, which commands 45 per cent of the national raw-milk market, is seen as a strategy to retain farmers&rsquo; loyalty and woo new suppliers. The Ruiru-based processor has a daily peak milk intake capacity of more than 1.5 million litres from its nearly 160,000 suppliers.The move is likely to trigger price wars from New KCC, Buzeki, Sameer and Githunguri dairy firms, which is likely to increase further the prices of raw milk, a win for farmers.Gethi said commercialisation of the dairy enterprise is key to increasing incomes for smallholder farmers, who account for over 70 per cent of daily raw milk supply volumes.&ldquo;We have rolled out a market oriented approach that seeks to have more smallholder farmers sell their milk to processors in order to grow income especially for rural households,&rdquo; Gethi said.
