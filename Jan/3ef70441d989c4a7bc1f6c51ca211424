Nominated MP Johnson Sakaja has blasted opposition chief Raila Odinga over his claims the National Intelligence Service officers are interfering with the ongoing voter registration.Raila on Tuesday accused NIS of listing people in Uganda and Ethiopia to participate in the August 8 polls against the law.Raila has been leading campaigns for voters to register ahead of the August 8 poll but has categorically stated that he will not accept "results of a rigged election"."The National Intelligence Service interference is aimed at influencing results the same way it did in 2007 and 2013," the opposition leader said in a statement on Tuesday.But Sakaja accused Raila of issuing the alarming statements with the primary objective of trying to delegitimize the ongoing voter registration process and ultimately the final voter register.&ldquo;This is because he knows that the results will not favor him because his vote blocs have lower numbers than Jubilees,&rdquo; Sakaja said in a statement.&ldquo;In the long term this statement will also serve as another plank in his narrative when trying to explain why he lost, after the August elections,&rdquo; said Sakaja.He lashed at the Cord leader telling him off for fighting every single state institution set up by the constitution in a bid to ensure that there are no independent organs that can check &ldquo;his raw ambitions to get into power through unconstitutional means.&rdquo;&ldquo; This is why he has made all manner of accusations against the three arms of government; from the Judiciary (which he called &lsquo;koti bandia'), to Parliament, to the Executive. He has fought the Public Service, IEBC, EACC, DPP, OAG, AG, Police, KDF and even local chiefs,&rdquo; said the former TNA National chairman.It leaves one wondering how he would run a country if he were to ever get the power he lusts for so much, said sakaja.However, Sakaja sent a warning to all the officers serving in such institutions across the country that Raila would most probably fire most of them were he to ever ascend to power. &ldquo;As Jubilee we know that Raila Odinga knows he cannot stop the re-election of President Uhuru Kenyatta so now he is looking for what excuses to use when he loses,&rdquo; he said.
