I am humbled by their gesture,&rdquo; she said on phone.She says that by six months, the contributions will be enough to buy a prime land in Kenya, especially in the coastal region, where the women can develop it by putting up houses for rental or residency.&ldquo;Through the Nyota Ndogo Sauti Ya Wanyonge Foundation, I am aiming at helping women, as well as other marginalised sections of the society, to get to another higher level in life.&rdquo;[VIDEO] Nyota Ndogo bashes Miguna over Passaris 'rape' talk
