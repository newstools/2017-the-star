Ulinzi Stars striker Kevin Amwayi is set to rejoin Western Stima during the pre-season transfer window.Western Stima chairman Laban Jobita has revealed the parties have agreed on almost everything ahead of signing a deal which will see Amwayi return to his former team four years after serving the soldiers.&ldquo;Yes, we have approached Amwayi (Kevin) and he should be with us next week to finalise on the deal. We know he is a good player, who will add some value to our team.&rdquo;Late in 2016, the forward hinted he was contemplating leaving Ulinzi Stars or football as a whole but it is now clear the Power men have hijacked his mind and offered him a contract.Before moving to Ulinzi Stars, the utility player was fielded as a defender at Western Stima but coaches Salim Ali, Francis Onyiso, Benjamin Nyangweso and Robert Matano preferred him as a striker for the soldiers.Meanwhile Gor Mahia have launched talks with Western Stima over defender Joash Onyango.K&rsquo;Ogalo are keen on roping another player from the Kisumu-based club after they captured the services of top midfielder Kenneth Muguna (as confirmed by organising secretary Judith Nyangi).Western Stima chairman Laban Jobita has told Goal that his side has been approached by Gor Mahia to sign the defender but insisted that no final deal has been made.&ldquo;Gor Mahia approached us yesterday (Friday) for the services of Onyango but they were to be with us today (Saturday, January 7) at the training ground to further talk on the issue. &ldquo;We are still waiting for them although I know that the player has been training with them (Gor Mahia).&rdquo;According to &lsquo;Nyangi&rsquo;, who was speaking on behalf of Gor Mahia, the former West Kenya Sugar player has penned down a deal with K&rsquo;Ogalo and will be part of their 2017 squad. &ldquo;We have successfully signed Joash Onyango from Western Stima. He is now our player.&rdquo;Gor Mahia officially announced the signing of seven players on Friday and promised to extend the list in due course.
