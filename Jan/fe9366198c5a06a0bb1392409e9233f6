Sugarcane shortage caused by prolonged drought turned ugly after two tractors belonging to Sukari Industries were set ablaze at Oyani weighbridge in Uriri subcounty on Monday.Sugarcane was also torched by arsonists believed to be from a rival firm.The Transmara Sugar Industry and government-owned Sony Sugar Company operate in the region.Speaking to the Star on the phone yesterday, Sukari general manager Paven Trappa said they lost more than Sh3 million in the incident.He said police are investigating.Kenya Sugarcane Growers Association secretary general Richard Ogendo the told the Star the problem is because out of the three millers, only Sony Sugar has reliable contracted farmers and a nucleus farm.&ldquo;The nucleus farm is always used by the company as a buffer when there is drought, while Sukari and Transmara risk closure because of lack of cane, which forces them to poach,&rdquo; he said.Ogendo said millers have been competing for farmers contracted to harvest mature cane for quick cash.&ldquo;Most contracted farmers get input and loans from factories, which make any attempt to poach them aa direct loss,&rdquo; he said.Sony Sugar management has previously accused the two millers of poaching their cane.
