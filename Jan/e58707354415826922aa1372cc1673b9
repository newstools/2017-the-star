Manyani GK Prison inmates&rsquo; demand that they be allowed to vote in the August 8 General Election is entirely legitimate. The fact the majority of them are serving life sentences is not unconscionable.In the US, where the assumption in too many jurisdictions was for many years that felons and ex-felons suffered a &ldquo;civic death&rdquo;, Chief Justice Earl Warren, in a landmark 1958 ruling, held that &ldquo;citizenship is not a right that expires upon misbehaviour&rdquo;. Prisoners retain their civic status throughout their sentences.In Kenya since at least 2010 the Supreme Court has held that prisoners have the right to vote, including in national referenda.Prisoners in GK Prisons even take national primary and secondary school examinations.The Manyani inmates&rsquo; plea points at the ticking election clock.The Legal Resources Foundation Trust holds that there is no legitimate governmental purpose that would be served in denying prisoners their right to vote. We concur.
