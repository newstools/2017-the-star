Lecture halls in most public universities remain empty as the lecturers&rsquo; strike is well into its second week. At Maseno University, most students went home after the first week.University Academic Staff Union Maseno Chapter chairman Wycliffe Odiwuor said most of the university&rsquo;s branches are deserted.He urged Education CS Fred Matiang&rsquo;i to solve the lecturer&rsquo;s issue with the same speed he did exam cheating. Odiwour said if the strike takes too long, the universities will have a backlog due to double intake.&ldquo;This we will not take this lying down because in previous years when we accepted double intake, the ministry promised we were to be compensated but they never honoured their commitment,&rdquo; he said. Odiwour said they do not trust the government&rsquo;s word.&ldquo;After spending billions of shillings campaigning [to put] one of our own at the helm of the African Union, the countries pledging support pulled out at the last minute because they don&rsquo;t trust Kenya,&rdquo; he said.Lecturers demand higher pay and implementation of a CBA signed in 2013.
