Chinese multinational tech firm Lenovo has kicked off 2017 with the launch of next generation personal computers, which it promises will enhance work and entertainment flexibility.Announcing the release of the new devices at the ongoing 2017 edition of the Consumer Electronic Conference in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA, the manufacturer credited the innovative devices to consumer response from prior launches.The firm&rsquo;s president and COO Gianfranco Lanci said the ThinkPad X1 family of PCs was developed in response to expressed needs of consumers who now &ldquo;blur the line between work and personal PC use&rdquo;. First in line is the 2017 edition of the ThinkPad X1 Carbon with two colour variants, the classic ThinkPad Black and silver.Lenovo touts it as the lightest 14-inch business notebook, weighing just 2.5 pounds. And in keeping with its traditionally sleek devices, Lenovo has fitted a 14 inch IPS crystal display screen on a body with the form factor of a 13 inch PC.This translates to a thinner bezel around the LCD screen giving more viewing room.In keeping with a shift from the conventional type A USB ports, the ThinkPad X1 comes with the Thunderbolt 3 (USB Type C) ports, meaning faster transfer of data between devices. Because the transition from USB Type A to USB Type C ports is gradual, adapters are available from third party manufacturers to facilitate connectivity that would otherwise be incompatible.As regards connectivity, the X1 will be rolled-out 5G-ready on wireless Wide Area Networks (Wireless WAN), as well as WiGigTM to allow low latency-mass data transfer which is ideal for immersive augmented and virtual reality usually used in video games, and high speed download of High Definition content over the internet.With due consideration to the fine line defining the new generation of PCs as either work or entertainment units, Lenovo has bumped up the size of the X1&rsquo;s battery offering up to 15 hours of use.Lenovo have given due consideration to cyber security specifically attacks that require social engineering to implement infiltrations. The ThinkPad X1 comes installed with a fingerprint sensor fitted with a dedicated chip for biometric processing. This is especially ideal when paired with the Windows Hello feature on Windows operated devices.It incorporates facial recognition through an Infrared camera to enhance device security.The updated ThinkPad X1 Yoga is the first 14-inch notebook with an OLED screen that offers users true multi-mode capability and can deliver stunning colours and absolute blacks.The ThinkPad X1 Tablet also announced at the conference offers increased modularity; the ability to separate and combine components such as port expansions, lengthened battery life, and an integrated projector that facilitates transition from creation to presentation on the go.
