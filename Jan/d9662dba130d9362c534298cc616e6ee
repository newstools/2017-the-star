Mombasa Senator Hassan Omar has demanded an audit of the number of firearms Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho and his cronies have.He said the National Firearms Licensing Bureau should also investigate the number of firearms owned by private citizens, especially politicians at the Coast.Omar, Joho&rsquo;s fierce critic, said the governor and his family have more than 19 guns, which they usually walk around with, intimidating citizens.He said Joho walks around with 15 armed police officers, who were withdrawn last week following an altercation with President Uhuru Kenyatta during the commissioning of the storm water drainage system at Bamburi.Addressing the press at his Kizingo Renaissance Centre office, Omar said on a typical day, Joho&rsquo;s convoy has about 30 guns when moving around town and attending public rallies.He said Joho&rsquo;s convoy has an escort police car with four officers, his vehicle with two armed officers and a third vehicle following his official car with at least five armed officers.&ldquo;In addition to the 15 armed officers, Joho walks around with his two guns. His cronies in the convoy also have firearms. This translates to about 30 guns in his convoy whenever he is moving around the county and when attending rallies,&rdquo; Omar said.However, Joho&rsquo;s director of communications Richard Chacha termed Omar&rsquo;s allegations mere propaganda aimed at tarnishing the governor&rsquo;s name. &ldquo;There is no day Hassan Sarai has made it on page one by selling his agenda. He has to mention Joho. His allegations are baseless. We have not complained about our security,&rdquo; he said.
