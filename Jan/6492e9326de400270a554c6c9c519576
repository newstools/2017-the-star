Energy Regulatory Commission has denied reports that electricity tariffs have increased during the tenure of the Jubilee government.Media reports indicate the cost of power has risen in the past four years due to higher tariffs and value added tax.However, ERC said the cost of electricity has reduced significantly, helped by the addition of cheaper geothermal power in the grid.&ldquo;One of the key milestones achieved to date has been on the reduction of the fuel cost charge, leading to a reduction in the overall retail electricity tariffs. As a result of this development, electricity bills have declined significantly in the period between July 2014 to December 2016, a cumulative decrease of 60.5 per cent,&rdquo; the ERC said on Friday in a statement.&ldquo;This was a consequence of addition of new cheaper geothermal generation capacity and sustained dispatch of cheaper hydropower plants. On average, consumers under the lifeline consumer tariff, which is charged to low income consumers, have witnessed the highest decrease of 27.6 per cent.&rdquo;Official data by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics indicate the low income consumers, who consume up to 50 kilowatt hour paid Sh691 in July 2014 compared to Sh542.42 last month.On the other hand, the costs for consumers which use up to 200Kwh dropped from Sh3919 to Sh3497.1 over the same period.President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to lower the cost of power before he was elected in March 2013.After assuming power, he launched the 5000 mega watts programme in September 2013, hoping to increase the grid capacity by adding cheaper renewable energy.Latest data from Kenya Power shows the country&rsquo;s energy mix in the grid has improved from 53 per cent hydro, 25 per cent thermal and 20 per cent geothermal in June 2013 to 41 per cent hydro, 13 per cent thermal and 40 per cent geothermal as at the end of December 2016.This puts the country&rsquo;s renewable energy at about 83 per cent of total installed capacity, boosted by the injection of additional 280 megawatts of geothermal energy to the national grid in 2015.ERC said the injection of cheaper power has since July 2014 lowered the domestic customers' unit cost by 22.2 per cent, while industrial customers unit cost has decreased by 24.4 per cent.&ldquo;As has been the case previously, there will be continued attention on enhancement of the quality, adequacy and sustained overall reduction in the cost of power in the country,&rdquo; it said.
