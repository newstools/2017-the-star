The Kerio Valley Development Authority and several other donors have suspended multimillion-shilling projects in Kerio Valley due to bandit attacks.So far, more than 100 projects have stalled in Elgeyo Marakwet, West Pokot and Baringo counties. More than 100 medical staff and 600 teachers have also fled for fear of their safety.The Kenya Red Cross has put on hold a Sh300 million irrigation project at Tot in Elgeyo Marakwet county. More than 30 people have been killed in six months.KVDA chief executive officer David Kimosop said they were unable to proceed with construction of a mango processing factory due to inter-clan conflicts among the Marakwets and banditry attacks.&ldquo;We cannot go on with implementation of the project unless security is restored,&rdquo; he said. Kimosop said they considered moving the factory to Arror, Marakwet West.He said KVDA operations in the region have been greatly hampered by security problems since last year. The authority has been spearheading peace talks with leaders to implement its key projects.The leaders involved in peace meetings include Governor Alex Tolgos, Senator Kipchumba Murkomen, Kericho Senator Aaron Cheruiyot and Marakwet West MP William Kisang.&ldquo;Insecurity has caused many development activities in Kerio Valley to stall. We need a collective approach to deal with the banditry problem, which is retarding civilisation in our region,&rdquo; Murkomen said.The government last December deployed more than 400 police officers and hired 300 police reservists, but the attacks continue in many areas. Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet has frequently visited the area but a solution is yet to be found.
