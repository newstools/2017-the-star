Elders of the Ajuran community in Wajir have vowed to disregard clan based politics in the run up to the August elections. The elders said they will prioritize the development of Wajir county.The elders were speaking in Wajir town yesterday when they unanimously agreed to support the incumbent governor Ahmed Abdullahi for a second term in office. The elders said they have decided to elect Abdullahi with out any conditions."Our community did not support governor Abdullahi in 2013 but he has treated us fairly and we believe he has performed tremendously. In that regard, we pledge to support him with out any conditions," elder Ahmed Adan said.He added: &ldquo;As the campaigns gather momentum and politicians seeking various seats crisscross the county, it is our appeal to the residents not to allow the political call divide them along tribal lines. They should also reject such kind of leaders by not voting for them. All we want is peace to prevail in our county before during and after the polls,&rdquo; he said.The elders said they will individually take part in the campaigns of Abdullahi and together with the 20 member committee of the Degodia community, they will drum up support for the governor.Abdullahi's administration was credited by the elders for establishing an operation theater at Bute sub-county which the community has greatly benefited from. The hospital carried the first ever c-section operation last year.Abdullahi expressed that he was humbled by the community's declaration to support him and pledged to give the people of Wajir his best if given a second term."The support of these elders is very crucial in the coming elections. I am extremely happy and humbled to get their nod" said Abdullahi.Abdullahi who was also endorsed by his Degodia elders earlier this week, will face off the current ambassador to Saudi Arabia Mohamed Abdi Mohamud.
