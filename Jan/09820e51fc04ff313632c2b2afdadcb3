Newborn (pictured) deaths have reduced by 70 per cent since free maternity services were introduced four years ago, a new study has shown.Before, Kenya would lose 100,000 children in the first 28 days after birth, but the number has reduced to 30,000.The free maternity programme started in June 2013 has largely been successful, despite financial problems, Management Sciences for Health director Dr Spencer Ochieng told the Star yesterday.The Council of Governors has in the past raised the alarm over delayed disbursement of funds to support the project. The project has also been faced with shortage of health workers.Ochieng said Kenya has the potential to reduce maternal mortality to zero if these problems are resolved.He said the project has received mixed reactions in different counties.&ldquo;The project has varied responses. It depends on the county. Some are really having a burden on the issue of free maternity, while others will tell you it has been a game-changer,&rdquo; Ochieng said.The Management Sciences for Health is a Nairobi-based NGO that has a 20-year partnership with the government to improve human resources in public health facilities. Ochieng said the success of the free maternity is anchored on adequate timely funding, as well as increased number of health workers to meet the demands of the programme. &ldquo;Some [hospitals] have seen 100 per cent increase in the number of expectant women seeking help,&rdquo; Ochieng said.
