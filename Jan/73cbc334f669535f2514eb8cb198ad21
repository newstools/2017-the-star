Kiharu MP Irungu Kang&rsquo;ata (pictured) yesterday said he has never been opposed to the Senate but to the calibre of senators Kenya has. He said many senators have failed. Kang&rsquo;ata said his track record proves he is ready for the role. He is in the running for Murang&rsquo;a senator. &ldquo;I believe in the best leadership in any position no matter the circumstances,&rdquo; Kang&rsquo;ata said.
