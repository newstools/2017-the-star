Vast herds of pastoralist cattle invading the Aberdares and Mount Kenya threaten the country's precious forests and rain catchments - and Nairobi's already rationed water supply.For months Samburu and Pokot cattle invading Laikipia county have grazed farms and conservancies to dust, with little action from police or government to evict them from private land.Now the cattle, numbering up to 135,000, have started trekking out of Laikipia and into Nyandarua. Dozens of herds have already been seen passing Nyahururu. Incursions into the Aberdares threatens to disrupt the water catchment. Rivers feeding reservoirs such as Ndakaini Dam, which supplies most of Nairobi's water supply, are already declining in flow. Ndakaini is less than 50 per cent full and water rationing for Nairobi residents is expected to worsen as severe drought bites in the coming months.Dozens of cattle herds were also seen heading towards Mount Kenya's forested slopes, another precious 'water tower' for the country under dire threat from invasion.For months Laikipia residents' pleas for the government to tackle the invasion of cattle from Baringo, Samburu and Isiolo have gone unheeded - and now the problem is shifting south.Read: Laikipia farm invasions continueAlso read: Dutch tourists escape unhurt as youths stone their vehicle in Laikipia
