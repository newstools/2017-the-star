The doctors union has dared the government to arrest its officials for skipping hearings at the Labour Relations court .Warrants were issued on Tuesday for the arrest of KMPDU officials by the Kilimani OCS.Justice Wasilwa Hellen said in her judgment that the doctors failed to appear for sentencing on contempt charges.But Ouma Oluga, Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Union secretary general, said the government should stop intimidating striking doctors through the courts."Doctors in Kenya are irreplaceable. The government is just testing our resolve,&rdquo; he said."What do I want the healthcare system of my country to look like? Nowhere in the answer does a warrant of arrest come.&rdquo;Oluga said health workers will not resume duty until their demands are met by the government."We will not be cowed. The strike is on and the only reason we will go back to work is the implementation of the CBA."The court declared the strike illegal and ordered them to resume work immediately.It directed union officials to call off the strike that has contributed to the deaths of at least 20 people. But the union defied the orders.Read: Labour court declares doctors strike illegal On Monday, Council of Governors chairman Peter Munya said counties are free to advertise doctors' positions and conduct recruitment so the public can be treated.Munya, who is Meru county chief, also said public service boards have been instructed to begin the processes of firing striking doctors.The doctors, after a meeting with President Uhuru Kenyatta in Mombasa, rejected the government's offer to increase their salaries by 40 per cent.A day later, a team of union officials were ejected from the Treasury building after they insisted on the 300 per cent raise as stated in their 2013 CBA with government.[VIDEO] Doctors union officials ejected from Treasury meeting after rejecting Uhuru's offerThe government has blamed the doctor's union for the 'illegal strike' that started on December 5, 2016.This was after it offered a Sh50,000 increase for the lowest paid doctors, which would raise their salaries to Sh176,000, but unions rejected the same.Spokesman Eric Kiraithe said the union was offered good packages but instead it has not stopped the strike, which is now in its 37th day.Read: Doctors begin 'longest strike in history' over 2013 CBA agreementMore on this: State blames KMPDU for 'unfortunate' doctors strike
