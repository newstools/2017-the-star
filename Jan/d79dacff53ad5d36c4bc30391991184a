Residents of Mastore-Salama village in Juja, Kiambu county, have said they are living in fear following an attack by thugs after a dispute between them and a land-buying company linked to an MP.On Tuesday, the villagers said they fear more attacks. They alleged the company, linked to Thika town MP Alice Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a&rsquo;s family, hired the goons. Last Saturday, the thugs attacked the village and destroyed 10 houses.The residents said the private company wants to reduce the size of the plots it sold them from 40x80ft to 40x60ft. Residents&rsquo; spokesman Johanna Mwaniki said the weekend attack was conducted by 15 youths suspected to have been ferried from Kiandutu. They were armed with crude weapons.&ldquo;They demolished houses and fences. They also planted beacons inside residents&rsquo; houses. The villagers retaliated and overpowered the youths,&rdquo; he said. Three thugs were seriously injured, but escaped. Mwaniki said the goons threatened to attack the villagers again.&ldquo;We are living in fear, because we don&rsquo;t know what the attackers are planning to do. They are known to be brutal,&rdquo; he said. Mwaniki said residents were not given notice or a court order showing the company was allowed to divide their plots.&ldquo;They claim we haven&rsquo;t paid for our plots in full. Some of us have been on this land for 15 years, and the company has never raised such an issue with us. Why now?&rdquo; he said. Mwaniki said residents were only issued with certificates, but not title deeds. &ldquo;The company is taking advantage of the situation,&rdquo; he said. Company officials were unavailable for comment.
