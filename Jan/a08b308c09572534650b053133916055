Bondo MP Gideon Ochanda and his nominated counterpart Oburu Oginga have set aside their differences to campaign for ODM leader Raila Odinga.Oburu said Bondo being Raila&rsquo;s backyard should lead by example by registering as many voters as possible. The final mass voter registration before the elections began on Monday.&ldquo;The big contest is for the presidential seat that has remained elusive to us and not our local politics,&rdquo; Oburu said. He said their target is to register more than 100,000 voters by February 14.Ochanda urged aspirants to convince residents to register. The two spoke on Monday at the Bondo CDF office after meeting aspirants seeking various positions.Oburu urged every elected Luo MP to lead a serious campaign to increase the number of new voters in their constituencies.&ldquo;After [President] Uhuru Kenyatta assented to the draconian [amendments to the] election laws, we decided not to vent our anger on the streets but to embark on a vigorous voter registration campaign,&rdquo; he said. Oburu told aspirants the nominations will be free and fair. He urged residents not to believe people who claim to already have nomination certificates, saying no one, not even he, has received a certificate. Oburu said he and Ochanda will resign as ODM chairman and secretary next week.
