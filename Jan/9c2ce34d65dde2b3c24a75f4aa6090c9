Mumias Sugar Company management has been urged to partner with cane outgrower schemes to successfully revive the firm. Mumias Outgrowers Company director Gamaliel Anamanjia said the problems bedeviling the sugar miller were caused by management&rsquo;s ignorance. &ldquo;The management of the MSC has failed to appreciate the important role played by cane farmers. They do not promptly pay farmers and in turn, the growers have boycotted growing cane for the company,&rdquo; he said. Anamanjia further said the government should channel any money meant to clear farmers&rsquo; outstanding arrears directly to their accounts.
