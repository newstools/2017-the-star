Do not be offended by Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka&rsquo;s urging that you should not run for governor but defend your Senate seat, Kitui Senator David Musila has been urged. &ldquo;This was wise and well-meaning counsel,&rdquo; said Kitui county Maendeleo ya Wanawake chairperson Ruth Mulandi and Kitui Professionals coordinator Campell Munyambu.On Friday they criticised Musila for &ldquo;overreacting&rdquo;, publicly defying Kalonzo and saying he would run for the top job against Wiper incumbent Governor Julius Malombe.Musila, the Wiper national chairman, publicly criticised Kalonzo for meddling and said he should concentrate on running for President. The Kitui people, not Kalonzo, should choose their governor, he said.Speaking on the phone on Friday, Mulandi said Kalonzo&rsquo;s wish that Musila run for reelection on August 8 &mdash; and not take on Malombe &mdash; was in line with an MoU ahead of the March 4, 2013, election.&ldquo;There was an agreement that Malombe, who hails from the Kitui subregion, would be allowed to defend his seat this year. A person from Mwingi would then be allowed to run for governor in 2022,&rdquo; she said.Mulandi said based on that agreement, Musila should drop his quest for the county top job in the interest of party unity in Kitui.Munyambu said Kalonzo is an intelligent, respected and wise national leader. &ldquo;Kalonzo&rsquo;s wish that Musila drop his governor bid was informed by his desire to see the Wiper brigade in Kitui remain united,&rdquo; he said.Munyambu said Kalonzo wants harmony in Kitui, his home county, but that&rsquo;s impossible if Musila and Malombe fight each other. As he visited Kitui last Monday, Kalonzo said he is close to both Musila and Malombe and each should defend his own seat. He promised to mediate between the two.
