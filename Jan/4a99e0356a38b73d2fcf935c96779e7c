Italian Athletics agent Dr. Gabriele Rosa is happy to have gotten another lifeline in Kenya after doping allegations almost threatened the management.Last year, his son Federico Rosa, who is a senior official at the Rosa and Associati management, was charged in court with doping allegations. The case was, however, withdrawn by the state in November.Dr. Rosa is the founder of the management and is also considered the father of marathon running in Kenya due to the huge talent he has produced. He spoke yesterday, for the first time after the incident.According to Rosa, he almost quit Kenya wondering why the allegations were brought against his management, yet he has helped discover several athletic talents for the past two decades. &ldquo;Last year was not a good year for us. You know the history and we decided to be around anyway,&rdquo; Rosa said at Eldoret Sports Club during a briefing for the Sunday&rsquo;s Discovery Cross Country.Rosa said the decision to be back in Kenya was very tough as he was not certain of the case outcome. &ldquo;I am happy about Kenya for what I have done. However, I wasn&rsquo;t happy last year but now I am happy again because the situation is completely clean. My decision to be back in Kenya was not easy. It was a very tough one and I must relax my mind now that it is over,&rdquo; Rosa explained.&ldquo;I get strength when I see the many talent I have nurtured for the last 27 years. I am happy about that but I had to ask myself many questions because Kenya is my second home after Italy. However, we know what happened and what was said about us was lies,&rdquo; Rosa added. The Discovery Kenya cross country and half marathon are the oldest races in Eldoret town founded by the veteran Italian marathon coach.
