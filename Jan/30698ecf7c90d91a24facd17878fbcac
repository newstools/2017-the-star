Parliament has proposed drastic amendments to the Independent Policing Oversight Authority Act, threatening IPOA&rsquo;s independence and powers to question police officers.The Miscellaneous Amendments Bill might cripple the watchdog as it seeks to subject the authority to stringent procedures in its work.The proposed Bill also denies IPOA unlimited access to documents and items required from police for investigations.The current Act gives IPOA powers to summon any serving or retired police officers and to demand any document, item or information that may be considered relevant to the function of the authority.Permit for access to evidenceBut the new law seeks to insert a provision requiring IPOA to follow the procedures of obtaining privileged information before acquiring any details required or summoning officers for investigations.This means the authority must get express permission from the Inspector General of Police to summon officers or get information from police stations or any police facility.There has been a push and pull between IPOA and IG Joseph Boinnet, with the authority accusing the police boss of sabotaging investigations to hold police accountable for their misconduct.Lawyer Wahome Thuku said IPOA is an independent constitutional institution and the law curtailing its independence is unconstitutional.He said IPOA was established to deal with all complaints against the National Police Service or individual officers.&ldquo;The law empowers it to obtain all information and material without any interference by anyone or institution. Where any such information is said to be privileged, such determination should only be made by a court of law on application of IPOA or NPS,&rdquo; Thuku said.The IPOA has written to National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi expressing its concerns over the amendments.&ldquo;Privileged information as stated in the proposed amendments has not been defined in the interpretation ... and will likely be interpreted ambiguously,&rdquo; IPOA says in its letter.&ldquo;It is prone to abuse by those under investigation as they may either divert, conceal or hide any crucial information sought.&rdquo;
