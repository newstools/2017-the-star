Few Kenyans have interest in pursuing diploma and certificate courses in technical and vocational education and training institutions, despite the incentives offered by the government to attract more students. The Kenya Universities and Colleges Central Placement Service says there were 60,000 learning opportunities in those learning institutions in the 2015-16 academic year, but only 13,000 students applied. Placement officer Johnson Gichinga said the rest preferred diploma programmes offered by universities.The Higher Education Loans Board widened its spectrum to advance loans to students pursuing diploma studies in public TVET institutions, but the targeted students continue to despise the colleges. Gichinga said there is unnecessary attachment of glamour to studying at universities or holding a university degree or diploma. He said the majority of university graduates &ldquo;tarmac&rdquo; for years before getting a job because of holding qualifications that are not in demand, while some of those studying at TVET institutions get jobs before completing their studies.&ldquo;Almost every university is graduating thousands of Bachelor of Arts degree students every year. They join others in job search. Some take up to five or even 10 years before getting a job,&rdquo; Gichinga said.&ldquo;In 2014, a student who wanted to pursue Architectural Engineering declined an offer to pursue a different degree programme at a university because he did not qualify to pursue the course of his choice. He went to Thika Technical Training Institute for a Diploma in Architectural Engineering. After the first year, he got a job with a real estate firm that went looking for students undertaking the course.&rdquo;
