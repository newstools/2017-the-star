Kigumo MP Jamleck Kamau has condemned Mombasa Governor Ali Hassan Joho for allegedly insulting President Uhuru Kenyatta two days ago. The governor on Thursday dismissed reports that the national government had allocated huge amounts of money for development projects at the Coast, saying they were funded by international donors. Kamau said Joho has little regard for the Presidency and should not insult the President.
