The Kenya Pipeline Company has set aside Sh14.5 million for an annual scholarship scheme to benefit bright and physically challenged students from poor backgrounds. The fund will also help train persons with disability on how to access government tenders. In the Inuka Scholarship Programme, KPC will partner with the National Council for Persons With Disabilities, and the 2016 KCPE candidates will be the first beneficiaries.KPC&rsquo;s managing director Joe Sang said the programme will, starting this January, offer Sh80,000 annually for every physically challenged student joining Form One. They will select a boy and a girl, who scored the highest marks in KCPE exam, in each of the 47 counties. &ldquo;We have embarked on this initiative to empower and transform the lives of young persons living with disability,&rdquo; Sang said in a statement to the media.
