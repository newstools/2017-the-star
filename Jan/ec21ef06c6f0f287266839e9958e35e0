Bandari FC newly appointed technical director, Twahir Muhiddin says the club will no longer sign any more established players during this transfer window.Instead, he said the team will go for the talented youthful players to give the team the much needed consistency.This is after Bandari acquired the services of Thika United midfielder Michael Luvutsi, who is expected to bring stability in the midfield after the departures of Antony Kimani, David Gathering and David Kingatua. Luvutsi, who was Thika United&rsquo;s vice captain, has already signed for the coastal side and is expected to partner with Ugandan import Musa Mudde at the heart of the Bandari midfield.According to Muhiddin, this could probably be the only big signing for the club. He said Bandari&rsquo;s main focus will be on the youth to allow consistency as opposed to the past when the team&rsquo;s performance has been unpredictable.Muhiddin, who is also a certified CAF instructor and former Harambee Stars tactician, said recruiting youthful players will give the team a better future, adding that young players are bound to grow with the team.The tactician, who was at the helm of Bandari until June last year when he was replaced my by his assistant Ken Odhiambo on an acting capacity, said the established players have been giving the team a very raw deal and short life, a move that has seen the team twice survive relegation.&ldquo;This big names are like a temporary solution for the team and you cannot rely on them wholesome because they don&rsquo;t have a future themselves,&rdquo; Muhidin said in reference to early last year when Bandari signed ten top players among them six internationals. He said all the big names signed last year could not play for the first team at the end of the first leg either due to discipline issues or fitness problems.A majority of them were released during the June transfer window, leaving the team with a lean squad which went ahead to perform exemplary well. Muhiddin said the team will resume training this week under new coach Paul Nkata, who will help identify and fix loopholes before the season starts.
