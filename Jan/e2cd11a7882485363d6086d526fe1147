But prominent Eldoret lawyer Simon Lilan claimed the former MP may have been killed for&nbsp;political reasons and due to his vast wealth. He said Too may have been given a poison that killed him slowly. Too sought treatment at the hospital in Eldoret on Christmas Day&nbsp;saying&nbsp;he had been having stomach pains but refused to be admitted overnight. He&nbsp;collapsed at his home in Eldoret on December 31 and was rushed to the St Luke's hospital where he was pronounced dead. The family took the body to the Eldoret hospital morgue before it was flown to Nairobi.

The lawyer said the transfer of the body to Nairobi was part of a cover-up and that&nbsp; Too&rsquo;s first wife Mary cried when she was informed that the body would be moved. The ex-MP's other widow Sophie&nbsp;said her husband had many&nbsp;local and international friends who needed to view his body before burial, and that Nairobi was the most convenient location.&nbsp;But Lilan said&nbsp;those in the city should have gone to Eldoret. &ldquo;MTRH has the better facilities than Lee. There was no need to take the body to Nairobi," he said. He added that&nbsp;he visited the morgue and found that there were several empty fridges, one which he said had been reserved for Too. &ldquo;When you look at circumstances before and after his death, you come to the irresistible conclusion that this prominent son of our land may have been assassinated because of political reasons and his vast property," he told journalists. Lilan said&nbsp;he had acted for Too in several land matters and that they were related by marriage. He said they discussed several matters including politics before Too died, and that the former MP told him&nbsp;he was to sell part of his land in Nakuru and support his son Moses' bid for a political seat in the region.The lawyer said an independent investigation must be carried out to establish how Too died.Read: I bought land, I didn&rsquo;t grab it &ndash; Mark TooAlso read: Ex-MP sued on Eldoret land&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
