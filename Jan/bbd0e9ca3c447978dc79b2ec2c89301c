Nairobi woman representative hopeful Millicent Omanga has denied claims she uses the poor for political mileage. Speaking while meeting a group of women in the city yesterday, she said, &ldquo;My opponents have started a smear campaign to portray me as a candidate who is not sensitive to the poor and the disadvantaged. But all that will pass because I am committed to uplifting the poor.&rdquo; Last week, residents accused Omanga of using the poor to gain political mileage. This is after it was alleged she promised to pay the bills of hospital patients, but they later said only one of them was helped.
