One person was killed and another one wounded when Pokot attackers invaded Arror, Marakwet West, on Sunday.Civil society organisations yesterday condemned the attack, blaming the government for prioritising voter registration over security as crime increases in the Kerio Valley.Elgeyo Marakwet civil organisation secretary Wilfred Kihara lashed out at Deputy President William Ruto, who visited the area on Saturday. He said he should have addressed the insecurity problems instead of only rallying residents to register as voters. &ldquo;We were shocked by the DP&rsquo;s selfish move of pushing more people in banditry- prone areas to register, yet killings and cattle theft is going on,&rdquo; Kihara said.He said the voter registration spearheaded by President Uhuru Kenyatta and Ruto is an indication the government is not dedicated to ending clashes between the Pokot and Marakwet.&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t ask people living in snake-infested caves to register as voters. This is a case of misplaced priorities,&rdquo; Kihara said. He said the civil society will sue the state for compensation over the Kerio Valley attacks. The Sunday attack at Chesuman happened a day after Ruto addressed voter registration rallies in Churo, Kipsaraman, Kabartonjo and Kabarnet in Baringo county. He then headed to Iten in Elgeyo Marakwet and Eldoret.Marakwet West acting deputy county commissioner George Kubai said the suspected Pokot bandits fled with cattle before attacking police reservists and residents pursuing the stolen livestock.&ldquo;They killed one man on the spot and injured another one,&rdquo; Kubai said. He said the body of Justine Chemweno, 34, was taken to Iten mortuary. Philemon Rotich, 32, who was injured during the attack, was taken to Kapsowar Mission Hospital. &ldquo;Tension is still high in the area. Police from the operation team at Tot have been deployed to recover the stolen animals,&rdquo; Kubai said.
