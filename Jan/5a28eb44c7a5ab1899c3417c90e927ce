A court yesterday remanded seven Cameroonian nationals accused of fleecing an American businessman of Sh6.4 million by pretending to sell donkey hides. They were remanded for seven days. The suspects, including a woman, appeared before city magistrate Christine Njagi at the Milimani law courts. They did not take pleas as investigations were not complete.They include Amber Michael, Derrick Akebe, Erick Wankwe and Domissfu Buruma. Others are Epizitune Metuge, Ayafor Aiden Ayafur and Etchi Franky Enongene. They were arrested on January 4 in Lang&rsquo;ata. Investigating officer Pascolyne Kilua said she required more time to allow Tuyen Nguyen, the American businessman to travel to Kenya to identify the suspects. Donkey-hide gelatin is in great demand in Chinese traditional medicine.
