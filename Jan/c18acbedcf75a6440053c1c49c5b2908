An editor with the Standard Media Group was yesterday charged in a Nairobi court with stealing a vehicle belonging to KTN news anchor Joy Doreen Biira. Aaron Ochieng denied the charge before senior principal magistrate Joyce Gandani. A statement recorded with the police on Friday shows he did not steal the vehicle as alleged, but he and Biira had agreed to hide it and claim payment from her insurer. Ochieng also told police he was instructed by Biira, who allegedly handed him the car keys, that they could sell the vehicle and share the proceeds. But Biira&rsquo;s statement indicates her car key was stolen from her desk at her workplace at the Standard Group&rsquo;s main offices. The court heard that Ochieng committed the offence on December 23 last year at the Standard Media Group Ltd. Police recovered the vehicle in Kisumu bearing the number plates registration KCH 117L. The hearing is on February 3.
