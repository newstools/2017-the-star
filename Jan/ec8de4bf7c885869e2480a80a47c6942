Defending champions Swamibapa hope to bounce back this weekend when they take on Nairobi Gymkhana and Ruaraka in the Nairobi Provincial Cricket Association Twenty20 tournament even as umpires are expected to stay away from matches over unpaid dues.The umpires are demanding payment for services that date back to last year.NPCA fixture secretary Narendra Patel said: &ldquo;We would like to bring to your attention that following our meeting with KCU &amp; SA yesterday, the umpire&rsquo;s association has advised NPCA they will not avail their members to umpire any games until their outstanding payment is cleared.&ldquo;We regret the above situation, which has been brought about by delay in collection of outstanding fees from member clubs&rdquo;.Patel confirmed that NPCA were working on alternative arrangements to ensure matches go on as scheduled.&ldquo;We do not promise we will be able to provide umpires for all the divisions/games in short notice but we will make all the effort to try to get some members to stand in. We are requesting all the member clubs to assist us in providing names of their members who are willing to umpire our games,&rdquo; he said.Unfazed by the shock defeat they faced in their opening game against Sikh Union at home last Sunday Swamibapa are hoping for a victory away from home.Today Swamibapa will be at Nairobi Gymkhana against a side that easily beat Cutchi Leva last Sunday before taking on Ruaraka away. Just like their visitors, Ruaraka will also be in search of a win after falling to Kanbis on day one.With the squad boasting of eight current and former national team players alongside three professional players, Swamibapa&rsquo;s technical bench is working overtime to ensure the boys get their act together to outsmart the two youthful sides.&ldquo;We have put the defeat at Nairobi Jaffery behind us. We have been in this kind of situation before and we have gone all the way to becoming favourites. The boys are positive and confident of giving their best to bounce back into the game,&rdquo; skipper Maurice Ouma said.Admitting the team did not have enough scores to defend with 135 runs on the board, the captain said the boys have to adjust quickly if they are to bounce back.Other matches this weekend will see Kanbis welcome Kongonis today and Gymkhana tomorrow.Red hot Stray Lions will also be at Cutchi Leva today in search of a second win after beating Kongonis last week before taking on Sikh Union tomorrow at Simba Union.Today Sikh Union will host Ruaraka.Today&rsquo;s matches begin at 2pm while tomorrow matches will bowl at 9am.
