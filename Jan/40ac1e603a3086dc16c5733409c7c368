Opposition leaders under NASA will camp in Trans Nzoia county for two days starting today to mobilise residents to register as voters. ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi will lead the ‘NASA Kura’ campaign, just two days after Deputy President William Ruto’s team received a hostile reception in Bungoma. “We will be in Trans Nzoia to ask our people to register and sell our agenda as NASA,” he told the Star on the phone yesterday. A few days ago, Mudavadi held talks with Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang’ula in Nairobi to discuss Luhya unity ahead of the August 8 polls. It has not been confirmed if Wetang’ula will be in Trans Nzoia for the tour, but organisers said MPs and other leaders from NASA-affiliated parties will be present. Today, Mudavadi will meet elders in the county in his capacity as the Luhya spokesperson. He will then attend another joint meeting of Luhya and Kalenjin elders. The second meeting will be attended by former minister Kipruto arap Kirwa, the ANC deputy party leader. “We will have extensive activities for our movement, which is dominant,” Kirwa said. Mudavadi and Kirwa will then meet county opinion leaders. All the meetings will take place in Kitale town. Tomorrow, Mudavadi and the other leaders will address a major rally. Allies of the ANC leader said he has gained ground in the region and would lead an onslaught to ensure residents are fully “NASArised”. “With the unity that is growing between Western leaders led by Mudavadi and Wetang’ula, it’s clear the region is a NASA zone. The Luhya community will not go for anything less than the presidency,” Bungoma NASA official Saul Waswa said. Mudavadi will then extend the NASA vote-hunt to the North Rift, considered a Jubilee stronghold. The National Super Alliance is to be officially launched soon.
