Kaya elders have urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to respect leaders elected by coastal residents. They warned that the sea would soon &ldquo;speak&rdquo; if the government does not restore security details for Governors Amason Kingi and Hassan Joho.The elders spoke on Monday during a press conference at Mazeras. They criticised the Jubilee government for frustrating Coast opposition leaders.Kaya Council of Elders chairman Erastus Kubo was present. They urged Uhuru to reinstate the security within 24 hours. Apart from guards for Kingi and Joho, the security for Kaloleni MP William Kamoti and Kilifi assembly speaker Jimmy Kahindi was also withdrawn.&ldquo;Kingi and Joho were put into power by the people and he should respect us. We are ashamed when our leaders are disregarded as if they are not supposed to be in power. Let the President respect other elected leaders because we can mobilise voters to vote the President out,&rdquo; elder Mbeo said.
