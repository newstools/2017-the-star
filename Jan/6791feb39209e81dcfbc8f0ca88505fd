Three suspected drug barons were arrested in Mombasa on Saturday. The three, Ibrahim Akasha, Vijayawada &lsquo;Vicky&rsquo; Goswami - an Indian and Gulam Hussein - a Pakistani national, were nabbed at Akasha&rsquo;s house in Nyali. Police claimed that they could be linked to a container suspected to be having drugs. Their lawyer Cliff Ombeta said that the officers who raided Akasha's house were after Bakatsh Akasha. "This was like an American movie,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The officers were heavily armed and did not want to talk to anyone. They are looking for Baktash Akasha. We don't know where the other three are held," he said. Sources told the Star that the operation was led by ATPU boss Munga Nyale and other top officers from Anti-narcotics and DCI. Ombeta said that they were blocked by several cars as they tried to chase the arrested persons. "Am with Warda&rsquo;s sister to Baktash Akasha, but we can't trace them. The ATPU boss Nyale confronted me and said that I am interfering with their work,&rdquo; Ombeta said. Mombasa county police commander Peterson Maelo said:"Let the officers finish their work. Their findings will be made public,&rdquo; Maelo said.
