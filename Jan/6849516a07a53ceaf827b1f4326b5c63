The Environment and Commercial Consultancy Company in Kitengela will be closed over the foul smell it emits and posing a health hazard, Kajiado Governor David Nkedianye has said.He gave the order on Friday following allegations that the incinerator is used for burning hospital waste and human body parts collected from government and private hospitals.The Sh2 billion incinerator was established three years ago in Stony Athi near Kitengela town on 50 acres. The company is associated with University of Nairobi don Prof Philip Mwabe.Nkedianye gave Mwabe up to today to come up with a proposal showing what he is going to do with the land.He said he will not let residents suffer from the hazardous smoke and smell emanating from the factory.The governor spoke after a three-hour closed-door meeting with Mwabe and his lawyers in Kajiado town.The incinerator is the largest private waste management facility in East Africa, but the owner has had issues with Kitengela town residents for several years before he moved it to Stony Athi in Kaputie North ward.After moving to Stony Athi three years ago, residents of Embukabat destroyed a fence and accused Mwabe of putting their lives in danger.During the meeting, Nkedianye said, &ldquo;This incinerator has no place in Kajiado county. I cannot allow the lives of my people to be put on the line by an individual whose interest is to make money.&rdquo;&ldquo;An exit plan for this investor will set us free. If skirmishes occur here, Mwabe should be held responsible.&rdquo;The governor was referring to a major meeting held by the local Maasai at the factory in Stony Athi who said they would not leave the place until they are addressed by their governor.&ldquo;We do not want tribal animosity in Kajiado. It&rsquo;s in the interest of the people that you do not restart that machine,&rdquo; Nkedianye told Mwabe.Mwabe said, &ldquo;Give me a way of smooth exit. There is a lot of stock in there. I spent Sh2 billion to put up that incinerator. If you close it up right now, I may die of heart attack.&rdquo;He told Nkedianye he has lived in Kitengela for 20 years and his establishment had only been there for three years.Area MCA David Nkirrimpai told Mwabe to move out quietly and avoid annoying residents further.Last week, a foul smell emanating from the factory spread in a radius of 15km.Residents claimed children and women in the villages vomited, while others had terrible headaches after inhaling the foul smell.Jonathan Kimiti said, &ldquo;The most we can allow is your trucks to come carry away those smelly things. We want to know how long it will take.&rdquo;
