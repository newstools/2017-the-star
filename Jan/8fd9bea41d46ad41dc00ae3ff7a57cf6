The Kenya Red Cross Society has launched an initiative to raise money to feed starving Kenyans.Secretary general Abbas Gullet yesterday said the society is seeking to raise Sh1 billion through the Kenyans4Kenya initiative to help two million people. 1.5 million face starvationLate last year, reports suggested that about 1.5 million Kenyans faced starvation due to poor rains in two years.The money will be used to treat malnourished children, pregnant women and lactating mothers in 10 counties worst-hit by the drought, targeting 350,000 people.&ldquo;We intend to conduct a direct cash transfer to the most food insecure families and where markets are functional, target 17,500 families,&rdquo; Gullet said.&ldquo;To the families where cash is likely to be diverted, we intend to use food vouchers targeting 7,500 families.&rdquo;Gullet said some of the money will also be used to rehabilitate key communal watering points where increased water pumping is causing breakdowns.He said under animal off-take and slaughter, the society is targeting weak animals likely to die due to the severe drought, thus making meat available to families instead of massive losses.The most affected counties are Garissa, Isiolo, Kilifi, Kwale, Lamu, Mandera, Marsabit, Samburu, Tana River, Turkana, Wajir and West Pokot, Gullet said.Others are, Baringo, Kajiado, Kieni in Nyeri, Kitui, Laikipia, Mbeere in Embu, Makueni, Meru North, Narok, Taita Taveta and Tharaka Nithi.Kenyans are experiencing malnutrition and increased risk of disease outbreaks, severe vegetation deficit and large-scale animal losses, Gullet said.He said as a result communities are in conflict over resources, which is mounting pressure on existing boreholes with the risk of them drying up.Gullet warned that the government can only overcome the drought situation through massive long-term investments in water and improved farming using technology. Previous donations used wellHe dismissed claims that money raised in the previous Kenyans4Kenya drive was misappropriated.We used 50 per cent of the contributions to buy food, while the remaining 50 was divided to undertake three pilot projects, he said.Gullet said well-wishers can send contributions through mobile phones on M-Pesa paybill number 10,000 with account name Drought.The government says it has enough food for Kenyans up to June, after which it will rely on food produced in the April-May long rains. If the rains fail, Kenya might have to import food, the state says.
