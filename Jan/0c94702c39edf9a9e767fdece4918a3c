The first few days of US President Donald Trump's administration have been remarkable.''Then they say 'is Donald Trump an intellectual? Trust me, I&rsquo;m like a smart persona,&rdquo; the president informed the CIA. &ldquo;Did everybody like the speech?&rdquo; Trump asked. ''I say, wait a minute, I made a speech. I looked out, the field was &ndash; it looked like a million, million and a half people.&rdquo;Crowd scientists who spoke to the Times estimated that about a hundred and sixty thousand people attended, compared with the record-setting 1.8 million who were estimated to have been at President Obama&rsquo;s first inauguration.The situation is in danger of turning Orwellian.My theory is the Trump administration is like an imperial court and no one is prepared to counsel and caution, and that's why we keep witnessing these crazy and vainglorious episodes like the size of his inauguration.Through executive order, President Trump has withdrawn the US from TTIP and lobbed some serious threats at the Chinese.The withdrawal from TTIP is signalling a more protectionist US encouraged profit-taking on the Dollar which had rallied sharply since November 8th.The UK supreme Court has ruled Parliament must vote on triggering BrexitIt is predicted and predictable that Parliament will accede to Brexit.The NSE20 sank -1.11% to close at a fresh 2008 low of 2873.02.
