Deputy President William Ruto avoided dishing out money to delegations from more than 10 counties visiting his home from December 27 to January 2.No public handouts were apparent, sources told the Star. No cash handoutsThe new election law forbids candidates from handing out money and other lures to voters at public meetings and harambees, eight months to the polls.Other sources said, however, MPs were given Sh100,000.More than 30,000 people visited the DP at his Sugoi home in Uasin Gishu county. Delegations came from as far Central Kenya, Nairobi, Kwale, Western, Baringo, Nakuru and all the counties in the North Rift.The delegations were treated to meals, water and soft drinks. Two large screens enabled attendees to follow the proceedings comfortably.A mobile clinic, mobile toilets and food tables and other facilities were set up. Tents had been erected in a field inside the DP&rsquo;s compound. Finding parking was a headache.&ldquo;Our Deputy President and Mama Rachel we are very happy with your gesture to host us through this Christmas and New Year season,&rdquo; Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago said.Sources said there was no open dishing of cash at the home because of the law already in force banning splashing of cash by politicians at fundraising meetings and other public forums.In the past, including last year during some visits, delegations were seen openly sharing cash after visiting the DP. But sources said in many instances other well-wishers had funded delegations to reach the DP&rsquo;s home.&ldquo;I am happy all of you found time to visit us at home and we feel greatly honoured,&rdquo; Ruto told each delegation.There were more than 600 elected leaders, including governors, MPs, senators and MCAs.Also in the delegations were hundreds of aspirants who were paraded during introduction sessions. The DP used the events to strengthen his political networks and garner support ahead of the August 8 general election.Saving taxpayers&rsquo; cashApart from governors who used their official cars, most of the vehicles that ferried the delegations were privately hired. Sources said the DP discouraged leaders from using government cars for private events.A neighbour to the DP, Beatrice Talai, said they were happy throughout the season because the gates to Ruto&rsquo;s home were open and they could go in freely and meet him.&ldquo;We tremendously enjoyed Christmas and New Year because the DP&rsquo;s family treated us well,&rdquo; she said.
