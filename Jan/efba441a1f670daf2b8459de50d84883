The Kenya Petroleum Refineries Limited is seeking a contractor to modify its crude oil storage facilities at Changamwe in readiness for storage of the country&rsquo;s crude oil. KPRL yesterday said it requires &ldquo;highly qualified companies or joint ventures with the requisite resources , skills , innovation and drive capable to deliver within limited time frames&rdquo;Applicants must have high engineering standards meeting or exceeding international standards, the company said, for thermal insulation works. &ldquo;Due to the hydrocarbon nature of the environment within KPRL facilities which necessitates strict compliance with working procedures for the avoidance of accidents and the safety of people and assets, working experience in large oil and gas installations is mandatory,&rdquo; the company&rsquo;s contracting and procurement manager said in a tender notice.KPRL has been mandated by the government to receive and store Kenyan crude oil under the Early Oil Pilot Scheme project. The country is expected to become a net oil exporter by 2022.Last year, President Uhuru Kenyatta said the government has &ldquo;set a path&rdquo; that will make the country become a key producer and exporter by 2019.This includes expediting the construction of the 891-kilometre (heated) Lokichar&ndash;Lamu crude oil pipeline.Tullow Oil which first discovered oil in Kenya in 2012, has confirmed that it will start oil production in March this year..Tullow&rsquo;s chief operating officer Paul McDade said his company has made good progress and will be ready to start oil exportation in June 2017.
