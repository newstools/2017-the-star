President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s political adviser Joshua Kuttuny has held meetings with members of the rival factions of Jubilee in Mombasa to iron out their differences.Jubilee leaders in Mombasa are divided into two groups - one loyal to Suleiman Shahbal and the other loyal to Anania Mwaboza.Both Shahbal and Mwaboza have declared their interest in the Mombasa governor position held by Hassan Joho. Kuttuny, who was in Mombasa for the Christmas and New Year festivities, separately met Shahbal and JP branch coordinator Fareed Swaleh to try and find an amicable solution to the impasse, which threatens Uhuru&rsquo;s vote hunt in the region.Swaleh is in Mwaboza&rsquo;s camp, as is JP branch chairman Ali Mwatsahu, who has rejected the interim party officials elected in mid-December.&ldquo;I talked with both groups. I tried explaining the importance of working together. They all agreed it is important to dialogue,&rdquo; Kuttuny said on the phone yesterday.Swaleh was unavailable for comment. Mwatsahu confirmed receiving a call from Kuttuny on New Year&rsquo;s Eve.&ldquo;He called to ask for a meeting. He asked me some questions and then told me to be on standby because he would soon call me for a meeting. He never did,&rdquo; he said.Mwatsahu is Mwaboza&rsquo;s main lieutenant and has been fighting Shahbal&rsquo;s main ally Matano Chengo, who was elected interim chairman.Kuttuny said there will be a follow-up meeting to bring all parties together in one sitting.
