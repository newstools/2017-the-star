A son of slain drug baron Ibrahim Akasha and two foreigners were on Saturday arrested over fresh drug claims.Speaking to the Star, lawyer Cliff Ombeta said his clients were arrested and they could not be traced in any police station.&ldquo;Ibrahim Akasha,Vijay Goswami and Gulam Hussein were arrested on different occasions, but my efforts to find their whereabouts bore no fruit as they have not been booked in any police station,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;At the Akashas residence in Nyali, I was roughed up by police officers, who held a gun on my head asking the whereabouts of my clients.&rdquo;Ombeta said his clients were arrested on allegations of harbouring two dangerous South Africans who have a container in Mombasa for clearing. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what is in it but my sources say it only has cigarettes destined to Zambia.&rdquo;Ombeta said Goswami was picked from Nyali golf course, where he had gone to play with friends, while Ibrahim&rsquo;s car was blocked and commandeered by police, who then abandoned it on the roadside.Ombeta said employees at the Akashas house were beaten up together with Akasha&rsquo;s brother Feisal, who was asked to produce Baktash.&ldquo;A convoy of more than 10 vehicles drove into the Akashas residence. Some of the police officers were foreigners. I fear they might extradite my clients to the US before winding up extradition proceedings,&rdquo; Ombeta said.Mombasa county police commander Peterson Maelo said police will reveal details once investigations are complete.Baktash, Ibrahim, Goswami and Hussein are fighting extradition proceedings to the US on charges of drug trafficking.They have been in court since November 2014 and are out on Sh5 million bond each.
