A court in Eldoret has issued orders stopping Monday&rsquo;s planned burial of former nominated MP Mark Too.Chief magistrate Nicodemus Moseti issued the orders after lawyer Simon Lilan moved to the court seeking independent investigations into the death of Too.Lilan through lawyer Morgan Omusundi said burial preparations are being hurried. He said, &ldquo;I strongly believe Too may have been killed because of politics and his wealth.&rdquo; Moseti has ordered the case be heard inter-partes on January 12.Lilan has sued Too&rsquo;s second wife Sophie, the burial committee including Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi, the Attorney General and the Lee Funeral Home, where the body is.&ldquo;The defendants, their agents or servants or anybody acting on their behalf be and are hereby barred by way of temporary injunction from collecting and or burying the body of Mark Too at his home and not elsewhere and that the body be eventually buried at the home of his first widow Mary Jepkemoi Too,&rdquo; the order reads.Omusundi wants a specimen collected from Too&rsquo;s body for DNA testing. He said the court had given him three days to serve those sued. Omusundi said it was evident that the family was split on the burial, and that it can not proceed until they agree on the matter. Lilan said he was interested in justice and that Too was a prominent personality whose burial should not be hastened. On Wednesday, a woman sued seeking to stop Too&rsquo;s burial. In an urgent application, Fatuma Hassan filed the case on behalf of her 16-year-old son, demanding the boy&rsquo;s school fees be paid from Too&rsquo;s estate. She said Too&rsquo;s wives excluded her son from the funeral arrangements. Hassan dropped the suit after Too&rsquo;s family agreed to involve her son.A postmortem stated Too died of heart problems.
