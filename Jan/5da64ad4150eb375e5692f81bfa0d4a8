Karima Boys High School in Othaya, Nyeri county, has installed CCTV to monitor students&rsquo; movements and prevent crime in the institution.Principal Herman Wanjau said the Sh950,000 equipment was installed last month after a parents&rsquo; meeting resolved to monitor students 24 hours a day.This was after student unrest in several schools led to strikes and left a trail of destruction, he said.Wanjau told journalists on Monday that 28 cameras are installed in the 10-acre compound.&ldquo;The students are aware they are being monitored and so they maintain high discipline in the institution,&rdquo; he said.Last year, Nyangwa Boys High School in Embu installed CCTV and brought in five German Shepherd dogs for security. In 2014, Limuru Model Primary School in Kiambu county installed CCTV.
