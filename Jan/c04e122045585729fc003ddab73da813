National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale has lashed out at those questioning the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission chairperson nominee.There have been concerns that chairperson nominee Wafula Chebukati and CEO Ezra Chiloba cannot work for the same commission because they both come from the same community and county.Speaking to the press in Garissa town on Saturday, Duale said it is not provided anywhere in the Constitution or the IEBC Act that the chairperson and the CEO should not come from the same community.&ldquo;Chiloba applied for the job and was recruited in a very fair, transparent, competitive and vigorous process and so is the current nominee for chairperson. The individuals saying all these things are the ones who believe in ethnic politics,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Those saying the two cannot work at the commission at the same time because they come from the same community believe in a tribal Kenya. Ours is a country that believes in merit.&rdquo;Duale said the face of Kenya is now well represented in the yet-to-be approved commission.He urged Kenyans to let the commission alone carry on with its constitutional duty of managing the electoral process.Duale said once the Speaker of the National Assembly receives the names from the President next week, he will then submit them to the Justice and Legal Affairs Committee for vetting and approval.Their approval or rejection will set the ball rolling for the new IEBC commission.The opposition went to the streets demanding that the Issack Hassan-led commission leave office, accusing it of biasness and incompetence.
