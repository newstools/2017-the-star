Part of a woman's ear was bitten off in her fight with another over a man in Voi town on Tuesday.Grace Wakesho said from Voi hospital that her rival, whom she did not identify by name, swallowed the part of her ear.The mother of one told the Star by phone that trouble started when the mistress visited her at her workplace in Voi."She laughed at me saying she had taken my husband away. I got angry and we began fighting. She bit my ear and swallowed the piece," she narrated.Wakesho said the woman had been having an affair with her husband."I don't know what is wrong with my husband because whenever he comes back, he complains that he is sexually starved and hungry. He acts very abnormally," she said.The injured woman added that her husband's parents had warned him against sustaining the extramarital affair."His parents have asked him to end the relationship with the 40-year old woman but my 27-year old husband has refused to heed their call," she said.Wakesho said her rival was not injured but went to the hospital for treatment."She is sitting with my husband," she complained, but vowed to prevent the mistress "who has never been married" from ruining her union.Wakesho said she reported the incident to police and obtained a p3 form."I am contemplating my next plan of action," she said.
