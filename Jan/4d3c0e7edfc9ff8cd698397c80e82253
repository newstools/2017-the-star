The Kenya Revenue Authority has begun to implement President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s directive banning maize exports. The taxman has warned exporters, customs agents and the public against exporting the commodity, saying the move will ensure the country does not run into a shortage amid biting drought. However, the order is likely to trigger smuggling of corn by some traders, the KRA said. &ldquo;Exportation of maize through smuggling or concealment is an offence that was punishable in the 2004 East African Community Customs Management Act,&rdquo; the statement reads. The government through the National Cereals and Produce Board announced that it had started buying maize at Sh3,000 for a 90-kilos bag in North Rift. Private millers are buying the same at between Sh2,800 and Sh3,200. The Ministry of Agriculture has indicated the country has 21 million bags of maize.
