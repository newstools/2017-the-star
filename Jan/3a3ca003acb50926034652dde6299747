Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong (pictured) yesterday expressed dismay over failure by Trade Mark East Africa to construct an ultra modern bus and trailer park in Busia and MalabaThe county and the company signed an agreement on construction.Speaking in his office , the governor said his government has lost millions of shillings due to lack of modern trailer parks.He was receiving a delegation from the Department for International Development led by county director Pete Vowles.&ldquo;Before TMEA started constructing a One-Stop Border Post , OSBP, in Busia and Malaba we entered into an agreement that they will construct ultra-modern parks as a gesture for donating land for the OSBP projects,&rdquo; Ojaamong said.&ldquo;Two years down the line nothing is forthcoming. Now TMEA wants to exit without fulfilling their obligations. Our current revenue of Sh200million per year could have doubled if we had modern bus and trailer parks.&rdquo;Ojaamong said the OSBP is disastrous to border counties. The county is losing revenue due to treaties that bar them from stopping at the border. Clearing agents have been put out of work by these laws.&ldquo;We are experiencing the influx of cheap products from the East African Community. The county and residents of border counties need to be included in any agreements,&rdquo; the governor said.Transport executive Bernard Yaite said the county had held discussions with TMEA and Kenha to expand the highway from the border by at least 6km.Vowles said he will liaise with the TMEA chief executive on the agreement regarding the construction of a modern bus and trailer park for Busia.
