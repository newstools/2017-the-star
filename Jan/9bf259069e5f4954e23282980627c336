The majority of Kenyans are looking forward to increasing their material possessions in the New Year, a new poll by Ipsos shows.The poll sent out yesterday shows that saving more money, getting a job and building or buying a house were the most frequently mentioned hopes, which, combined, attracted half of all respondents.By contrast, all spiritual or non-material mentions amount to just slightly more than a tenth of the respondents, the poll shows. These include developing a closer relationship with God, getting married or marrying another wife, living a healthier lifestyle, and having a child.&ldquo;Interestingly, however, nearly 20 per cent of the respondents declined to name a single goal or aspired achievement. Whether this is because they are completely satisfied with their current situation, or rather, have no realistic hope of material, physical or spiritual betterment, is unclear,&rdquo; Ipsos said.The poll did not cover the confidence levels of respondents in achieving these desired goals. The poll shows that for those in the poorest category (below a Sh10,000 income), getting a job received most mentions, whereas saving more money was the most desired goal among those in the two more affluent categories.Those affluent put more emphasis on the future, which entails furthering education and the non-material aspects, such as improving health or physical condition.The survey shows that contrasts in terms of gender are less significant, but more women than men hope to get a job next year, while more men seek to either build or buy a house.It also states that those aged above 35 want to save more money and build or buy a house, indicating a more solid economic or financial foundation than younger people.&ldquo;Finally, the desire for developing a closer relationship with God increases with age, suggesting that maturity tends to encourage a consideration of the more non-material aspects of life,&rdquo; Ipsos said.The survey involved 1,083 randomly selected urban and rural respondents above 18 years spread across 41 counties. They were interviewed in either English or Swahili on December 17-19.The margin of error attributed to sampling and other random effects for the entire sample was minus or plus 3.1 per cent at a 95 per cent confidence level.
