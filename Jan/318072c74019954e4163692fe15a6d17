Governors cannot account for Sh3.3 billion from the national government sent to the devolved units to maintain roads, raising fears the money may have been misappropriated.The Kenya Roads Board said the county chiefs may have spent the conditional grant to pay salaries and other expenditures and not to maintain county roads.Where&rsquo;s the money?Speaking to the Star, general manager Rashid Mohammed said governors have failed to submit financial reports on the use of the money allocated in 2015-16.This is despite efforts by the KRB to have the devolved units account for the money, he said.In 2015-16, the government had allocated Sh3.3 billion for road maintenance that was distributed among the 47 counties. In 2016-17, the allocation was increased to Sh7.5 billion, but the counties had only received Sh2.2 billion in the first tranch by December 31 last year.&ldquo;The problem we are facing is the lack of reporting by the counties on the use of the conditional grants,&rdquo; Mohammed said.&ldquo;It is possible that some counties are applying the funds on ineligible expenditures such as developing new roads as opposed to road maintenance, and payment for unrelated county activities such as salaries, medical and motor vehicles. This is against the requirements provided when receiving a conditional grant.&rdquo;We&rsquo;ll withhold future fundsMohammed warned over the possible delay and withholding of other funds if the counties do not account for the expenditure.The KRB is mandated by law to seek a report on the expenditure on road maintenance funds from the national and county governments.The state has complied and given a report.Mohammed said the lack of data and a report on the expenditure has also led to the fund not increasing allocations in relation to the counties&rsquo; needs.KRB was established through an Act of Parliament in 1999 and given presidential assent on January 6, 2000. It is supposed to administer road funds and coordinate the development and maintenance of roads.
