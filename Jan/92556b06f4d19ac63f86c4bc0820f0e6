Kenya&rsquo;s Olympic marathon champion Jemima Sumgong will defend her London Marathon title in April against one of the strongest fields ever assembled for a city race.Sumgong, 32, cracked her head on the road after falling three miles from the end of the 2016 race but bounced to her feet and fought back to take victory with a terrific late burst.Four months later, she became the first Kenyan woman to win Olympic marathon gold. &ldquo;London is the marathon every runner wants to win,&rdquo; said Sumgong. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait to return to defend my title.&rdquo;Compatriot Mary Keitany, who also fell after tangling with Sumgong but faded to ninth in London last year, returns for the race on April 23 seeking a third win to match the hat-trick of New York City Marathon titles she completed last November.Keitany, 35, became the second fastest women&rsquo;s marathon runner of all time, behind Briton Paula Radcliffe, when she won her second London race in 2012 in 2:18:37 but her lowly finish last year cost her a spot in Kenya&rsquo;s Rio Olympics team. Keitany, formerly half-marathon world record holder, is also desperate to do well.&ldquo;I love running in London,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;After the sickness I had before the race and the fall last year during the race, I want to show everyone what I can do.&ldquo;My goal is to win the Virgin Money London Marathon for the third time and to demonstrate to everybody that I could have won the Olympic Games last year if I had been selected.&rdquo;They will be joined by Olympic 5000m champion Vivian Cheruiyot who will be making her debut in marathon running as well as World Marathon silver medallist Helah Kiprop. Vivian, a multiple world champion over 5000m and 10000m, has a personal best of 67:54 over the half marathon, clocked while winning the Great North Run in September last year.She announced her ambitions to embark on the longer version after her triumph at the Rio Olympics where she won her first title over 5000m in over a decade of track running.The Kenyans will be challenged by Ethiopia&rsquo;s Mare Dibaba, who won bronze in Rio behind Bahrain&rsquo;s Eunice Kirwa and compatriot Tirunesh Dibaba, a triple Olympic and five-time world track champion who finished third on her marathon debut in London three years ago. &ldquo;This is a stellar field and everyone who is anyone in women&rsquo;s marathon running will be in London on 23 April,&rdquo; said race director Hugh Brasher.
