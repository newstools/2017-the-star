Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero has turned to the development projects his administration has undertaken as he appeals to residents for a second term. With only seven months to the polls, the city boss has embarked on commissioning new projects and inspecting the progress of others launched in 2014.Kidero&rsquo;s critics and challengers for the county&rsquo;s top job have accused him of failing in development, despite the high hopes the residents had in him when he was elected in 2013. On Wednesday, former Nairobi Town Clerk Philip Kisia, running mate of former Gatanga MP Peter Kenneth in the August polls, accused Kidero of not addressing garbage and traffic problems, as well as runaway corruption at City Hall.On Thursday, Kidero inspected several projects in Dagoretti South, the home turf of his fierce rival Dennis Waweru. The governor urged residents to give him another chance to complete ongoing projects.He visited Waithaka Polytechnic and pledged to put up a Sh100 million residential hall.
