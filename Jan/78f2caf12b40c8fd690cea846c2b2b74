ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi is going to be presented to National Super Alliance as the Luhya community preferred presidential aspirant.Party chairman Kelvin Lunani made the announcement shortly after Mudavadi was unveiled as the community's spokesperson at a rally on Saturday.Lunani said the community has spoken and has resolved that Mudavadi should wrest the Nasa ticket from Cord and Kanu hopefuls.The decision is likely to cause friction with Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang'ula, who had presented himself as the community's choice for the presidency.According to research conducted by the University of Nairobi Economic Department, Mudavadi was the most favoured with 38 per cent, head of Wetang'ula and Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya.The results were announced by Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli at a rally in Bukhungu Stadium, Kakamega county.The research sponsored by Atwoli was done between July and October 2016 and 2,600 respondents were interviewed.Wetang'ula and a handful of prominent leaders from the Western region skipped the event, eliciting anger on Atwoli's part.More on this: 'Angry' Atwoli hits at Khalwale, Wetang'ula, calls for respect during 'Luhya spokesman' rally"Besides facing other bigwigs for the nomination of presidential candidate, Mudavadi will work closely with every leader in Western to forge unity that is crucial to stem out division," Lunani told the Star on phone on Sunday.He dismissed other Luhya leaders eyeing the presidency and urged them to rally behind the ANC boss to avoid splitting votes at Jubilee's vantage.More on this: Wetang'ula asked to drop presidential bid for more capable MudavadiANC coast secretary general Jimmy Azangu asked Wetang'ula, Water CS Eugene Wamalwa, Senator Boni Khalwale (Kakamega), and other 'rebel' Luhya leaders to join hands with Mudavadi to evacuate Jubilee from their seats.Azangu asked Wetang'ula to listen to community voice and stop fighting &ldquo;the anointed one&rdquo;.Wetangu'la launched his presidential in April, 2016 at Muliro gardens in a chaotic meeting where police were forced to lob teargas at the main dais, forcing the leaders to be whisked away.Lunani said before Mudavadi was crowned the spokesperson, &ldquo;community brokers&rdquo; were all over &ldquo;hurting&rdquo; their chances of speaking in one voice and presenting a serious presidential contender.The national chairman urged proponents of Nasa - Raila Odinga (ODM), Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper), Wetang'ula (Ford Kenya) and Gideon Moi (Kanu) - to give Mudavadi a chance as he is the only able leader to dislodge incumbent president.&ldquo;The presidency shivers when they hear of the new Luhya spokesperson. He has proven to be unselfish leader who pushes for others interests before his,&rdquo; he said.
