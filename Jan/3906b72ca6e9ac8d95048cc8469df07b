According to the law, counties are required to return the money to the County Revenue Fund for it to be re-allocated. However, Oparanya pointed out that the statement showing the CBK cash balance for all the 47 counties as at January 18 2017 comes immediately after the National Government disbursed November 2016 funds to the counties. &ldquo;The statement was issued without due consultation is both inaccurate and in bad faith,&rdquo; part of the statement reads.The Kakamega Governor further said Counties had in the past engaged the National Treasury on serious constraints they faced fueled by the malfunctioning of the IFMIS system and delayed disbursement.&ldquo;This is the real issue the national treasury needs to address in order to streamline the flow of funds to the county governments,&rdquo; part of the statement reads.They have further called upon the government to ensure it secures the Integrated Financial Management and Information System (IFMIS) accessibility.IFMIS broke down on 12th December prompting to outcry by Governors over unpaid wages and bills before it being revived on 5th January.
