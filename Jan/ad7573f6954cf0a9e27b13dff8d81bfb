High Court judge George Odunga has quashed the DPP's decision to charge former Lugari MP Cyrus Jirongo in a Sh50 million fraud case. Jirongo was accused of giving false information linking Jonathan Moi to the fraud. He allegedly committed the offence between 1992 and 2015.The former MP was accused of inducing Post Bank Credit to accept bank charges on September 25, 1992, for land registered in the name of Soy Developers.He is also said to have told Sergeant Maxwell Otieno that he paid Jonathan Sh7 Million as the balance of a payment for the purchase of the company.The former MP allegedly said so at DCI headquarters in Nairobi on March 27, 2015, and presented forged documents.Odunga ruled on Wednesday that it would be unjust to prosecute Jirongo for an offence that was committed two decades ago."Use of criminal process to subdue the opponent is misuse of the court process," he said.Jirongo was summoned to take plea in February 2016 after the prosecution concluded its investigations.Read: Jirongo says he bought disputed land from Moi
