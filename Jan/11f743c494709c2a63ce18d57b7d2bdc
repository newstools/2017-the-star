Legislators are not in a last-minute rush to fulfil pledges and ask for votes, but they are fulfilling their obligation to serve residents, Kiambu MP Jude Njomo has said.I am not haunted by my election pledges because I have fulfilled 90 per cent of them, he said. &ldquo;If we are being accused of last-minute rush to fulfil our pledges as MPs to woo our constituents, then I have been campaigning since the day I was elected in office, as I have been doing projects that benefit the community all along,&rdquo; Njomo said.He spoke during a tour of projects funded by the national government CDF.Some aspirants in Kiambu county have accused MPs of using the NG-CDF kitty to campaign. &ldquo;The law has been enforced on all candidates taking part in elective posts not to participate in harambees and the MPs are using their CDF kitty to woo residents, hence intimidating aspirants,&rdquo; said Thika Town MP hopeful Patrick Wainaina.Njomo encouraged aspirants to sell their own policies and not focus on incumbents
