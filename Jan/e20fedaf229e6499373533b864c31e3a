Ida Odinga had no intention of marrying a politician but her wish did not come to pass as opposition leader Raila turned out to be a political engineer.Ida said this on Saturday at the funeral of professor Rok Ajulu, whom she said caused her to hate lawyers, political scientists and politicians while at the University of Nairobi.She said Ajuk subjected her to five years of study instead of the customary four. &ldquo;I was undertaking a Bachelor of Education degree that runs for four years but when Ajulu and his friend James Orengo led a radical movement at the university, I was forced to take another year,&rdquo; said Ida.Raila's wife said it was at this point that she and her friends vowed not to get married to lawyers, political scientist and politicians.&ldquo;That is why when I met Raila and he told me he was an engineer, I knew he was the man destined for me,&rdquo; she said.Ajulu, one of the academics who fled the country in the early 1980s at the height ofa purge on perceived dissidents, died on December 27 after a long illness.He taught in the United Kingdom, as well as in Kenya, before eventually settling in South Africa.Read: Uhuru mourns Prof Rok Ajulu, says husband of SA minister 'will be dearly missed'Ida told mourners that it was on her wedding day that she realised Ajulu was her relative.&ldquo;I was shocked when I saw the man I thought I would never meet after university accompanied by my sister-in-law. It was there that I understood that Ajulu was our relative,&rdquo; she said. She said she slowly adapted to the political environment from then on, and also learned that residents of Bondo, Siaya county, were a vibrant lot.Ida eulogised Ajulu as a sharp and vibrant person who pushed for democracy.Premas Hango from Namibia said he was a resilient nationalist who contributed to humanity in a complex way.Ajulu's business partners from South African said hiscourage made the impossible possible and that he helped them try new ventures.Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga said the late professor was a hero who fought for democracy at the expense of his education, especially after he was expelled from UoN.He promised to build a library in his memory in Siaya town, and to display his works for future reference.Guateng Premier David Makura said Ajulu was not only a scholar but also a revolutionist who believed in change.Makhura promised that the South African government will help establish working relations with one of the counties in Kenya in memory of the professor.Orengo, who is Siaya Senator, said Ajulu was the bridge between Kenya and the outside world. He said other leaders should take after him so Kenya can reach great heights.Many others said Ajulu was the son of Africa who advocated for long term change in all countries.
