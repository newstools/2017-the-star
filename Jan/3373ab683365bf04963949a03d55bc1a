A Meru governor aspirant has accused incumbent Peter Munya of "seriously" neglecting the miraa business leading to more poverty in the county.John Mbijiwe, who is eyeing the Jubilee Party ticket, noted the region's economy was highly dependent on miraa trade.Mbijiwe also noted that farmers and traders suffered a big blow after the crop was banned in the lucrative Europe and US markets in 2015.&ldquo;Families are starving, schools have been closed and retail shops remain shut. Most families lost their main source of money after the ban,&rdquo; he said in an interview with the Star on Thursday.Read: Meru decries European ban on miraaAlso read: State allocates Sh1bn to revive miraa and cushion farmers from Europe banThe aspirant asked Kenya's leaders to put in place measures to safeguard the business, to boost Meru's economy.He said the leaders had the sole responsibility of meeting stakeholders to discuss new markets and fight propaganda surrounding miraa trade.Mbijiwe defended miraa as harmless and said Europe banned supply because of local legislation errors that did not identify it as a crop.&ldquo;Miraa has no side effects. It was banned from Europe because the Kenyan government failed to recognise it as a crop in the law,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We should consider recent government reports on the crop and consider available options, which include direct lobbying.&rdquo;Read: High miraa intake lowers men's sexual performance, sperm quality - studyAlso read: Munya slams report on miraa's negative sexual effectsNoting investments in miraa trade create jobs and increase government returns, Mbijiwe said he had made efforts to protect the business.The aspirant is a consultant on counter-terrorism and security and is the founder and CEO of Eye On Security company. He said that if elected, he will make infrastructure development, health and education his priorities.&ldquo;Through my businesses, I have engaged a good number of global leaders on the miraa issue, on behalf of Rwanda, South Sudan and Somalia who are my clients. They agree that we must fight the propaganda and lobby to reintroduce the product to the European market,&rdquo; he said.But State House warned Governors against making decisions on national issues without consulting the relevant arms of the national government.Spokesperson Manoah Esipisu said no governor has sovereign power to consult on matters of national importance without involving the relevant arms of government.He was reacting to Munya's move to have consultative meetings with the government of semi-autonomous Somaliland last week which led to cancellation of miraa flights to Somalia.More on this: [VIDEO] Esipisu castigates Munya over miraa ban, warns governors against 'assuming' sovereign power
