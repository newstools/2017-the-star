The Judiciary receives an average of 3,000 complaints against it yearly.Though the complaints are reducing, 2,013 of them were closed successfully between 2014 and 2015.In statistics released by the Office of the Judiciary Ombudsman, 2,746 complaints were reported in 2013-14, while in 2014-15 some 2,888 complaints were reported.The increase in the reports &ldquo;could be attributed to greater public confidence in the Judiciary and our office,&rdquo; the report says.One of the high-profile complaints the OJO received was against former Supreme Court judge Philip Tunoi over the Sh200 million bribery scandal.Another was against suspended High Court judge Joseph Mutava. It was recommended that he be removed from office following the acquittal of businessman Kamlesh Pattni over the Sh5.8 billion Goldenberg case.The tribunal that made the recommendation was headed by Chief Justice David Maraga when he was a Court of Appeal judge.Mutava has appealed against his removal at the Supreme Court.In 2014-15, complaints received were that of slow service ( 155 ), missing files ( 149 ), corruption ( 29 ), delayed rulings ( 28 ), cannibalised files (four) and poor services at 13. On Thursday, Maraga said the OJO will be restructured and strengthened and Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu will head it. He said a fully fledged secretariat will be established to assist in its operations.&ldquo;The Judicial Service Commission has embarked on this restructuring process and it is hoped that the exercise shall be completed by the end of March this year,&rdquo; the CJ said.Maraga said where evidence of any form of corruption is obtained after investigations, action will be taken against any staff involved.&ldquo;We have also embarked on fast-tracking the JSC disciplinary processes and [are] working more closely with external integrity institutions such as the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission,&rdquo; he said.Our media are awash with allegations of corruption literally on a daily basis. And whereas the Judiciary, more than any other arm of government, has waged gallant wars in fighting this vice, it still remains a challenge, Maraga said.&ldquo;Corruption and the Judiciary must be hostile terms,&rdquo; he said.
