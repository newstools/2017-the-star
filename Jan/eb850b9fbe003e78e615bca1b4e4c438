The impacts of the current drought in the southern part of the country will lessen by mid-2017, latest forecasts by the Food and Agriculture Organisation show.However, counties in the North - in particular Turkana, Marsabit, Wajir and Mandera - will steadily get worse.In a statement, FAO says, &ldquo;In the affected counties, the terms of trade have become increasingly unfavourable for livestock keepers, as prices of staple foods are rising, while a flood of weakened sheep, goats and cows onto local markets has brought down livestock prices.&rdquo;Statistics from the National Drought Management Authority indicate that livestock body condition was poor in Mandera county in November last year.
