The government, through the Kenya Meat Commission, yesterday started buying malnourished animals from pastoralists.KMC commissioner Hassan Jelle said the government has set aside Sh170 million for the first phase of the exercise.He was speaking at the Garissa livestock market when he officially launched the programme on Wednesday.Jelle said the Livestock Offtake Programme, initiated by President Uhuru Kenyatta, aims to cushion the pastoralists against the drought.&ldquo;The programme is not a business, but something meant to help the farmers. Instead of losing their animals to drought and hardship, the President said they should sell them and use the money for other purposes or buy other animals when the drought ends,&rdquo; he said.Jelle said 1,200 animals will be bought in Garissa, 200 from each constituency. He said six agents have already been appointed in the constituencies to be in charge of the exercise.&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to start receiving complaints. This is the President's programme and we want to ensure it is as clean as possible. We will buy each animal for Sh15,000 to Sh18,000, depending on how it is,&rdquo; he said.The programme started in Tana River, Kwale and Kilifi counties, where the government has bought more than 30,000 animals from farmers.Jelle said the KMC will take the exercise to Wajir and Mandera counties.The Kenya Livestock Marketing Council chairman Dubat Hamey thanked the President for the initiative. He said it will go along way in reducing the loss the farmers would have incurred if all their animals died.He urged the government to increase the resources, noting the current allocation is not enough for all the 15 arid and semi-arid areas affected by drought.He also called on the farmers and ranchers who can can keep animals to also chip in buy animals from them.Some of the pastoralists who spoke to the press urged the government to increase the money at which it was buying animals at saying that ksh 15 was too little.The bad weather compounded by erratic rains led to a serious drought in the region. several animals died a s result.
