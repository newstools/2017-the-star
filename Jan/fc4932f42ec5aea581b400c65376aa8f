Mandera teachers have asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to fulfill his2013 pledge to hire more tutors.&ldquo;Our schools are still experiencing the same problem of shortage of teachers four years down the line. It has become worse. Needless to say it is this shortage that continues to [affect] performance in our schools,&rdquo; Knut executive secretary Mohamed Kullow said.He addressed the press on Wednesday in Mandera town. Kullow, who was flanked by other union officials, said the county is in urgent need 1,300 teachers. He said they need the teachers to fill the gap left by the untrained teacher whose services were withdrawn by the county last year.The county was forced to employ more than 900 untrained teachers in 2015 after those employeed by the government fled following a number of al Shabaab attacks targeting non-locals.Kullow said there is a shortage of 400 secondary school teachers and 900 for primary schools.He said al Shabaab continues to wreak havoc, killing innocent people, including teachers. Kullow cited Monday's attack in Mandera, where a Kenya Police Reservist was killed.&ldquo;There must have been a security lapse as the attackers planted explosives and detonated them for more than 30 minutes, they should have been sighted and engaged,&rdquo; Kullow said.Police said the suspects planted IEDs near Equity Bank and engaged responding officers in a shootout. No arrests were made as the suspects fled towards the nearby Kenya-Somalia border. The IEDs were safely removed and detonated.Kullow said the region rallied behind Jubilee in 2013 in the hopes it would end insecurity and improve education. The county has continued to perform poorly in national examinations, with the lack of teachers said to be the major cause.
