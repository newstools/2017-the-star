Governor Evans Kidero has said Jubilee wants to bundle him out of office not over development but because he is a Luo.&ldquo;Those people are attacking me because of my tribe. [If] I was [on] the other side, I wouldn&rsquo;t have been criticised. &ldquo;The other day I asked them if they want me to change my name to Kariuki if that will make them love me,&rdquo; he said on Tuesday.Kidero said he has launched &ldquo;many life-changing projects&rdquo; and a number of them have been completed. But his opponents are still hell-bent on criticising his administration, he said.HeckledKidero spoke in Soweto village, Kayole, when he inspected ongoing projects. Rowdy youths had stopped the governor&rsquo;s entourage, carrying placards and chanting &ldquo;No road no peace.&rdquo;They accused the governor of neglect. The youth demanded to know when a road would be completed and water restored.Kidero said the county government has set aside Sh600 million to build 9.4km of road and six kilometres are complete. &ldquo;Someone cannot say that we have not worked,&rdquo; he said.Kidero&rsquo;s rivals say the city is a mess, with roads in disrepair, garbage piling up, drainage clogged, traffic a nightmare, land grabbed and the county short of money. Kidero inspected the construction of a fire station. He urged the youth to acquire ID cards and register as voters. President Uhuru Kenyatta has ordered IDs processed in three days. Kidero said, &ldquo;Issuance of IDs should be done fairly in all parts of the country. It should not be done only in some regions because some people have interest there.&rdquo;He inspected construction of a road and sewer line in KCC village, and launched construction of Mowlem Health Centre.
