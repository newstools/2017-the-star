The delay in releasing free learning funds is hurting school operations, as the government is ensuring improper extra levies are not charged.Kenya Secondary Schools Headteachers Association chairman Alfred Indimuli said, &ldquo;We expect the Education ministry to release the 50 per cent of free learning cash for first term without delay, since the government has insisted on capping school fees.&rdquo;Education CS Fred Matiang&rsquo;i has said day secondary school fees will be Sh9,374, while boarding students will pay Sh53,553. Under the free learning cash programme, the government pays an additional Sh12,860 for every student in public secondary schools.Indimuli said secondary school heads will raise the problem of delayed funds with the CS tomorrow. They are filing returns for Form One selection and admission, which ended on January 16. Form One students started reporting to schools on January 9.Indimuli said the government subsidy of Sh12,860 for each student annually is for tuition. &ldquo;With strict fees guidelines and proposals of a new textbook purchase policy, we cannot commit funds in the subsidy to buy books,&rdquo; Indimuli said.Matiang&rsquo;i has proposed a hybrid book purchase system.It will be something between the centralised purchase by the government and the current decentralised system in which school heads are given cash to buy books.The CS says booksellers and head teachers have colluded, stealing billions of shillings in 10 years.The 23,000 public primary schools have also not received the Free Primary Education funds. Kenya Primary School Head Teachers Association head Shem Ndolo said they are yet to receive the first 50 per cent of the cash.The total subsidy for one pupil annually is Sh1,420.
