Prison warders have been urged to treat prisoners humanely to help them reform.This came as warders at Naivasha GK prison celebrated the promotion of 20 of their colleagues.Among those promoted was Patrick Mwenda, the officer in charge of the penal institution. Mwenda is now a senior assistant commissioner of prisons.Mwenda said the promotions are an indication of positive progress in the ongoing reforms of the Prisons Service. Officers are being motivated for the efforts they have made in helping reform inmates, he said."It is through sheer hard work that some of us have been promoted after a long time waiting and this is progress in the right direction," Mwenda said.He urged officers to work hard so they are recognised and rewarded."We have seen some officers promoted from a rank they have served for more than 10 years and this clearly shows determination to the call of duty," Mwenda said.He thanked the Prisons Department for the new policy of promotions.Officer in charge of the Naivasha Medium Prison Yusuf Kaitopok said the promotions are a motivator."We have a heavy duty of reforming some of the notorious criminals in jails and if we succeed on this then we will enjoy our fruits in promotions," he said.Retired senior superintendent of prisons Wallace Gachanja asked the officers to maintain discipline. "Once you have self-discipline you will be able to help inmates overcome their challenges and reform and this is key in any prison in the world," he said.
