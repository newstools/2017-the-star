A vicious fight for the presidential ticket is unfolding within Cord, despite outward but fraying claims of opposition unity and consensus- seeking.Cord co-principals Raila Odinga,&lsquo;Mr Diplomacy&rsquo; Kalonzo Musyoka and Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula are all elbowing each other to bear the coalition&rsquo;s presidential standard.Implications for the yet-to-be-launched National Super Alliance, NASA, are worrying.Raila and team believe this is their last chance. Wetang&rsquo;ula believes both Raila and Kalonzo have had their turn and should support him. Kalonzo says others must sacrifice for him.In public, Kalonzo&rsquo;s elbows seem the sharpest. Wiper and ODM are feuding in battle zones where neither enjoys majority support. Neither wants to yield.Both want to field candidates.&ldquo;For Trump to win in America, he did not play politics of diplomacy,&rdquo; Kalonzo said yesterday in Machakos town, signalling that he was going to play hardball politics.Kalonzo is frequently called gentlemanly and the diplomat.The former Vice President ( 2008-2013 ) made clear that others must sacrifice for him, as he sacrificed in the past.&ldquo;This is the message from the people themselves and I want Senator [Johnson] Muthama to get it very clearly because he chairs the Cord coalition together with Senator [James] Orengo,&rdquo; Kalonzo said.He made the comments during a stopover on his voter mobilisation tour in Machakos and Kitui counties. Kalonzo said it is time Raila and Wetang&rsquo;ula gave way for him to send President Uhuru Kenyatta and the Jubilee government home in the August election.He said he is very ready and determined to take on Jubilee and pleaded with residents to register.&ldquo;I am urging you to register in larger numbers because there is no retreating. For a long time people have said Kalonzo is a diplomat but I want to tell them that this time round we are going to play it the hard way,&rdquo; he said.Kalonzo also urged voters to punish all mutinous leaders who abandoned the Wiper party for the new Jubilee Party, which now is beset by problems.&ldquo;It is unimaginable for somebody to be elected a governor, MP or MCA under Wiper and later turn against the party and start fighting it. I ask you to teach these traitors a lesson come August.&rdquo;Although the Cord co-principals call the nationwide flurry of meetings voter registration inspection tours meant to inspire momentum &mdash; both Raila and Kalonzo are locking horns over how to field candidates.The fierce scramble between ODM and Wiper is taking place in regions where neither has overwhelming popular support.&ldquo;Each party wants to be assured of substantial numbers in the National Assembly, the Senate and county assemblies.This competition is a delicate scenario that must be explored cautiously so it doesn&rsquo;t turn counter-productive,&rdquo;political analyst Dismas Mokua told the Star.Raila and Kalonzo are stopping at nothing to galvanise support to ensure their party wins the majority of seats.The party with the most seats will have the lion&rsquo;s share in government appointments, should the opposition form the next government.The two Cord bigwigs are quietly feuding over the control of some regions, each undercutting the other. This could, however, undercut the opposition coalition as a whole.Yesterday ODM director of elections Junet Mohamed warned Cord parities against fielding parallel candidates, saying that would give Jubilee an automatic victory and majority in Parliament.&ldquo;I can assure you hat is the biggest threat we are facing. If we field different candidates, then Jubilee will win and you can take that to the bank and get interest on it,&rdquo; the Suna East MP said.He said Cord should learn lessons from its 2013 mistakes and avert scenarios where votes might be balkanised and deny the opposition asweeping majority in Parliament.&ldquo;If an ODM candidate is the strongest, let&rsquo;s allow him or her run against Jubilee. If it is Wiper or Ford-Kenya, they should be allowed to run against Jubilee &mdash; but not Cord parties fielding parallel candidates,&rdquo; Mohamed said.Inter-party competition cost Cord affi liate parties very many seats across the country, including in Migori where Governor Okoth Obado of PDP went on to win election after decamping from ODM at the last minute.Raila and Kalonzo are seeking to build a united opposition front to challenge Uhuru and Deputy President William Ruto under NASA.Also expected in NASA are Amani National Congress leader Musalia Mudavadi, the key proponent of the outfit, and Bungoma Senator Wetang&rsquo;ula of Ford Kenya.Kalonzo&rsquo;s Wiper party has rejected a suggestion by ODM to zone at least nine counties as ODM strongholds, setting the two parties off on a bumpy political ride.ODM plans to hold primaries from February 4 and stagger them until end of May &mdash; the longest period ever by the party &mdash; seen as a strategy to restore confidence in the process infamously marred by tumult and hooliganism.The party has clustered the country into Orange, Grey and Red regions, reflecting varying degrees of support. Grey areas are regions where the party&rsquo;s support equals that of its rivals.Red areas are regions where the party does not strong support, as inJubilee strongholds.In Orange regions, ODM enjoys almost fanatical support. Wiper has given aspirants seeking it ticket until February 15 to submit applications ahead of the primaries.The Star established that Wiper has resolved to take on Raila&rsquo;s ODM in Kisii, Garissa, Wajir, Mombasa, Taita Taveta, Tana River, Nyamira, Narok and Kajiado counties &mdash; despite the Orange party&rsquo;s appeal that the regionsbe clustered as Orange.&ldquo;We have told our partners we are going to fi eld candidates in all elective positions, including governor, senator, MP, Woman Representative and MCA in all those counties,&rdquo; said a member of the Wiper&rsquo;s National Executive Council. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
