The African Development Bank has offered $992,000 (Sh102.83 million) grant for a 7.8megawatts hydropower project in Central Kenya.AfDB Eastern Africa regional development director general Gabriel Negatu said the initiative is under the Sustainable Energy Fund for Africa, a community-owned structure.&ldquo;Members of the Mutunguru community in Central Kenya will receive a fixed small share of the project&rsquo;s profits. This additional financial benefit is expected to translate into significant economic and developmental impacts in the project area, particularly in terms of socio-economic empowerment and job creation,&rdquo; Negatu said in a statement.He said the Africa Climate Technology Centre will help in managing the project and train the community. Patrick Kimathi of the Mutunguru Hydroelectric Company said the programme supports the Feed in Tariff Policy in Kenya, aimed at increasing access to clean, affordable and sustainable energy. &ldquo;It will also enhance job skills of rural women as they take on additional micro-economical activities besides the ones they are already dominating; tea plantations and dairy farms,&rdquo; Kimathi said.
