Trying to establish how many people voted in the 2013 elections has remained as difficult as trying to firmly grasp a liver: slippery does not even start to describe it. Elusive is more apposite an adjective.Here is the story. The report of the Independent Review Commission (IREC or the Kriegler Commission) that reviewed the bungled 2007 polls had described voter registration in Kenya as &ldquo;open to serious criticism.&rdquo; Hence, after some delays related to the procurement of biometric voter registration (BVR) kits, the Independent Elections and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) undertook to register voters afresh to cure this congenital infirmity suffered by the then extant voter register. This commenced on November 19, 2012, targeted 18 million Kenyans across about 25,000 registration centers and ended on December 18, 2012. At its close, the IEBC published that it had registered 14,340,036 voters during the exercise.The voter registers were then opened for public inspection on January 14, 2013 so that Kenyans could verify the accuracy of the data in the IEBC records. Following this verification exercise, the IEBC published a gazette notice on February 18, 2013 announcing the completion of the compilation of the Principal Register. On February 24, 2013, details of the voter register (the Principal Register) were published on the IEBC website and recorded a figure of 14,352,545.This represented a growth of 12,509 voters between the closure of the voter registration exercise and the end of the voter verification exercise. How could these figures have increased while there were supposed to be no more voters registered?On March 2, 2013, the IEBC published an additional list of 36,236 voters who were said not to have had biometric information. Hence, on March 4, 2013 (election-day) we had a Principal Register and the list of non-biometric voters: both of which added up to 14,388,781. It was revealed by some political parties that the IEBC had given them a different version of the voter register to use on election-day. Yet, when the IEBC announced presidential election results on March 9, 2013, the total number of registered voters was 14,352,533. Surprisingly, this was not even the sum of all registered voters per county as recorded in the same announcement. This came to 14,349,896. When questioned at the Supreme Court about what the exact voter registration figures were, the IEBC submitted that the true and final voter register was not the Principal Register (as provided for by law) but what was known as the &ldquo;Green Book&rdquo;. It explained that the &ldquo;Green Book&rdquo; was a hand-written list of registered voters recorded by its officials at voter registration centers during the voter registration exercise (alternative or complimentary back-up perhaps?). It is critical to note that the &ldquo;Green Book&rdquo; had not been previously publicly mentioned or afforded to the public for scrutiny or verification.The &ldquo;Green Book&rdquo; comprised the Principal Register (14,352,545), the Special Register (36,236) and 12 trainee registrations; in total 14,388,793. On July 18, 2013, the IEBC would however announce that the total number of registered voters was 14,388,781. The 12 trainee registrations had vanished!The &ldquo;Green Book&rdquo; bears uncanny resemblance to the &ldquo;Black Book&rdquo; that was created in 1992 in preparation to the first multi-party elections. It is a hand-written collection of hundreds of individual notebooks listing voters and was recommended for discontinuation by the Kriegler report; in fact, the Kriegler report recommended that the destruction of the &ldquo;Black Books&rdquo; should be &ldquo;seriously considered.&rdquo;That there were clear discrepancies between the figures in the &ldquo;Green Book&rdquo; and the results announced by the IEBC is indubitable. Equally bad was what were observed or construed as strategic changes in the voter register: The pattern of changes appears to have been strategic in nature. A comparison of the numbers of registered voters per region in December 2012 and February 2013 shows that Jubilee stronghold regions were infused with a total of 68,148 additional voters while the Coalition for Reform and Democracy (CORD) strongholds were stripped of 14,125 voters&hellip; Overall, the net result of the changes amounts to 48,745 voters added between December 2012, when the voter register was officially closed, and July 2013, when the final results were published. Despite the IEBC&rsquo;s multiple attempts to explain all these discrepancies/irregularities in the voter registration figures, there is still &ldquo;no way to resolve the various, different totals of registered voters.&rdquo; The point being made here is the following: as we continue to vigorously urge Kenyans to register as voters, equally urgent is to unequivocally clarify to all how this registration exercise will translate into a credible voter register that can withstand even rudimentary scrutiny; and will actually will be the only and exclusive register used in the 2017 elections. Even before we declare any political side to enjoy the &ldquo;tyranny of numbers&rdquo;, Kenyans must ensure that they are not being tyrannized by a befuddling tantivy of whirling numbers.Ngure wa Gachanja is a human rights and democratic governance practitioner.
