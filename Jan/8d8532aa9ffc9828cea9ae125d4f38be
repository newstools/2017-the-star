Banks have linked slowing growth in disbursement of loans to the private sector to the high cost of funds that hit the industry in the last quarter of 2015.The Kenya Bankers Association says lenders are yet to fully recover from the turbulence that saw average interest on three-month Treasury Bills reach 22.5 per cent on October 22, 2015. This resulted in fund managers, insurance firms and high net-worth individuals demanding interest as much as 25 per cent on term deposits.&ldquo;The banking industry has gone through a turbulent period which started in fourth quarter 2015 with increased cost of funds that resulted in higher interest rates, and continued into 2016 with liquidity constraints and rising non-performing loans weighing on the credit market,&rdquo; KBA&rsquo;s director for marketing and communication Nuru Mugambi told the Star in an email.The decline in growth of loans to businesses for enterprise development started before the rate cap law was enforced on September 14 last year. Latest data from the Central Bank of Kenya indicate the growth had slowed from about 19.7 per cent year-on-year in December 2015 to about 4.8 per cent last October &ndash; the lowest since June 2008 when investments were yet to recover from post-election violence. CBK governor Patrick Njoroge on September 21, 2016, said the regulator would investigate the real cause of slowed uptake of loans by the private sector, which is a threat to economic growth since the country has experienced double-digit growth in private sector growth in recent years. &ldquo;We need to go and investigate and see who actually has done what,&rdquo; Njoroge said. &ldquo;We began to see this trend since June ( 2016 ) when it became much clearer, although there was some sort of deviation earlier in the year.&rdquo; The regulator in January 2016 tightened rules on provisioning against bad debt which hit a record Sh207 billion last September.The increased provisions against non-performing loans saw some banks report reduced profit for financial year through December 2015. Economic analysts have downgraded Kenya&rsquo;s growth outlook for 2017 to between 5.4 and 5.7 per cent from an estimated 5.9 per cent last year, citing reduced growth in private sector growth in spite of interest caps.&ldquo;Although Parliament passed laws capping interest rates, the expected benefits have not trickled down to the public and businesses,&rdquo; Mentoria Consulting chief economist Ken Gichinga said in the 2017 outlook report on January 10.&ldquo;The inability by businesses to have access to traditional credit from banks, sets the stage for a dramatic shift to private equity.&rdquo;
