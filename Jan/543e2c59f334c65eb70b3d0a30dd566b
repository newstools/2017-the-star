Deputy President William Ruto on Friday cautioned political leaders against regional zoning, saying it has retarded development in some parts of the country. He said marking zones as the political turfs of specific leaders, parties or ethnic groupings has led to underdevelopment in some regions. Ruto spoke during stopovers in Lokori, Morlem, Lokichar, Turkwel and Lorogon. He was on a tour of Turkana county to mobilise residents to register to vote in the August 8 general election. Ruto has been traversing the Rift Valley to drum up support for the drive. He said the Jubilee administration is focused on providing high quality services to all Kenyans, irrespective of their political affiliations. Ruto urged residents to join the Jubilee Party because of its commitment to unity and development, saying it is the only party that has Kenyans&rsquo; interest at heart.
