The body of Mark Too, popularly known as Bwana Dawa, arrived at his home in Eldoret yesterday for burial today at his Maziwa Farm near the Eldoret International Airport.The burial will take place despite a court order issued by a magistrate in Eldoret stopping the funeral.Lawyer Simon Lilan went to court demanding an independent probe into the death of Too, whom he claims may have been assassinated because of politics and his vast wealth.&ldquo;I will change my case to seek exhumation if the body is buried without samples being taken for the investigations and if it will also be buried away from the home of first wife Mary,&rdquo; Lilan said.Governors Jackson Mandago of Uasin Gishu, Cleophas Lagat of Nandi and Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi were at the airport to receive the body. It arrived aboard a plane that also carried his family, including widows Mary and Sophie.A short prayer was conducted at the airport led by AIC Bishop Patrice Chumba before the body was escorted in a convoy to his house, just two kilometers from the airport.&ldquo;We are prepared as the community of Eldoret and this county to give our hero Mark Too a befitting sendoff,&rdquo; Mandago said.President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto, along with opposition leaders and retired President Moi, are among those expected to attend.Heavy security was deployed at the home and tents erected in an open field where the funeral service will take place.Yesterday, an inter-denominational prayer service was held at the home, followed by local leaders delivering speeches paying tribute to the former politician.They said he touched the lives of most residents in Eldoret town.Too collapsed at his home in Eldoret on December 31 and was rushed to St Luke&rsquo;s Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.He had on December 25 sought treatment at the hospital, complaining of stomach pains, but he declined to be admitted for a night.Since his death, three court cases have been filed seeking to block the burial.The other case was filed by a woman who claimed he sired her son but the matter was sorted out by the family. More than 1,000 squatters also filed a suit at courts in Nairobi, laying claim to the 27,000 acres of land where Too will be buried.The squatters say they were allocated the land during retired President Moi&rsquo;s administration and they were seeking orders to block burial on the land in dispute.Thousands of people, including local politicians, visited Too&rsquo;s home to pay their last respects.
