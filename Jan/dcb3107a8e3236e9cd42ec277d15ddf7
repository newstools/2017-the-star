Kiminini legislator Chris Wamalwa (pictured) has dismissed reports that he plans to join JP. This was after he accompanied DP William Ruto to a rally on Monday to urge residents to list as voters. He said yesterday he attended the event in his capacity as area MP and nothing more. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t aware he was coming to sell the Jubilee agenda. This is what caused his heckling by the youth.&rdquo;
