The planned strike by Nairobi county workers was called off yesterday after the county and the workers&rsquo; union reached a consensus. More than 13,000 Nairobi county employees were to go on strike this morning over prolonged salary delays. They also protested against lack of promotions, non-remittance of statutory deductions and reluctance by the county to sign a collective bargaining agreement. Some members of the the Kenya County Government Workers&rsquo; Union said they were yet to be confirmed, despite working for more than two years. &ldquo;We have been in a day-long meeting and we&rsquo;re happy with the progress.The Legal department is drafting a document detailing how the issues we raised will be solved, &ldquo; branch secretary Boniface Waweru said. County secretary Robert Ayisi confirmed the two parties reached an agreement after a meeting chaired by Governor Evans Kidero. &ldquo; The meeting was good,&rdquo; he said. The union had accused the county of frustrating negotiations on the CBA, despite having agreed to sign it after the recognition deal.
