Corruption allegations have rocked the Energy ministry putting top chiefs on the spot over mismanagement of funds.It is claimed the ministry spent Sh11,085,360 on a five-day training at a Naivasha hotel.A memo to the Principal Secretary from the Kenya Petroleum Technical Assistance Project office, seen by the Star, shows the training cost per person for the five days, for 40 participants, was Sh277,134.The training ran between October 14 and 19, under the Kenya Petroleum Technical Assistance Project, which the World Bank had approved on overview of the international petroleum business.&ldquo;The five-day programme will cover the analysis of financial performances of oil and gas investments from both the project and corporate reporting perspectives. Agencies that will participate in the programme will nominate their participants to make a class of 40,&rdquo; the memo dated September 27, 2016, reads.The project is being implemented by the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum, the National Treasury and the Ministry of Industrialisation, Trade and Cooperatives.This is part of the $50 million (Sh5.1 billion) grant from the World bank given in 2014 to strengthen Kenya&rsquo;s capacity to manage the oil and gas sector, and the distribution of its revenue to create sustainable growth across the country.In a statement, the World Bank task team leader Alexander Huurdeman had said the project will support the government in managing the oil and gas industry through technical assistance, training, and development of a legal and institutional framework. However, the civil society has questioned the spend, calling for transparency on the expenditures, and wants to know the value the workshop will add to the economy.&ldquo;What was the productive contribution or engagement of those involved with the training, or was it just spending the funds?&rdquo; a civil society leader who did not want to be named said.This comes as the debate on oil revenue allocation rages ahead of the 2022 target for oil production and exports.Tullow Oil Company first discovered oil in Lokichar, Turkana county, in 2012. The government has projected that Kenya will become a net exporter of crude oil by 2022. Communities living around the oil wells are demanding a 10 per cent share of revenues. In October, President Uhuru Kenyatta, however, asked Parliament to reduce the allocation to five per cent. Joseph Kalapata, a member of the Kenya Oil and Gas Working Group, warned that a disconnect on revenue sharing could lead to conflict by communities within the oil exploration areas, even before the oil production.&ldquo;Communities felt that the 10 per cent revenue was not enough and the proposal to further reduce the share may result to conflicts. When the oil prices increase, will the allocation given to the communities increase as well?&rdquo; he said.
