The decision by Egypt&rsquo;s Qalaa Holdings to sell its controlling stake in the firm that runs the Kenya-Uganda railway line was informed by failure to generate returns for its investors, the company said on Friday.Qalaa, which has 85 per cent stake in the Rift Valley Railways, said the $320 million (about Sh33.24 billion) fresh capital injected into the more than a century old 1,200km railway in five years from 2010 has not raked in profits.The investment, the firm said, includes $66 million (about Sh6.86 billion) in concession fees to the governments of Kenya and Uganda.&ldquo;Qalaa Holdings&rsquo; decision to divest its interest in RVR was taken some time ago and comes in the wake of the board&rsquo;s conclusion that additional capital is required to complete the company&rsquo;s transformation programme,&rdquo; it said in a statement, denying reports the divestiture move was rushed. &ldquo;The decision was publicly disclosed by Qalaa Holdings as early as April 2016.&rdquo;The Egyptian Exchange-listed firm, which is in talks with potential buyers, has defended its record as principal investor in RVR. It indicated that since it came on board, it reduced transit time for moving cargo from the Port of Mombasa to Kampala by 29.8 per cent, acquired 240 high-capacity wagons in October 2015, and minimised incidents on the line by 40 per cent.Preliminary negotiations with &ldquo;more than one&rdquo; suitors of its stake, the infrastructure-focused investment firm said, were at initial stage, without giving indication on when they would be concluded.&ldquo;No formal or final agreement has been reached with any interested parties,&rdquo; it said. &ldquo;Until a final sale agreement is signed and its shareholding formally transferred, Qalaa will continue to provide operational and managerial support to RVR, while pushing ahead with the railway&rsquo;s three-point turnaround strategy.&rdquo; Qalaa, formerly Citadel, became the majority shareholder with a 51 per cent stake in the RVR consortium in March 2010 after acquiring a 35 per cent stake held by South Africa&rsquo;s Sheltam Railway through Africa Railways Ltd &ndash; its investment vehicle.Sheltam was the lead investor at the time the RVR consortium won the 25-year concession to operate the railway in November 2006, including five years for passenger-rail services which was renewed on expiry.The shareholding by the Egyptian firm rose to 85 per cent after it bought the 34 per cent shareholding from Kenya&rsquo;s TransCentury at $43.7 million (about Sh4.54 billion under the prevailing exchange rate). Uganda&rsquo;s Bomi Holdings, owned by billionaire businessman Charles Mbire, controls the remaining 15 per cent in the RVR.
