Leaders should stop politicising attacks on the borders of West Pokot, Turkana, Elgeyo Marakwet and Baringo counties to get votes, a legislator has said. Led by Pokot South MP David Pkosing, the leaders said the escalating crime on the border of West Pokot and Elgeyo Marakwet counties has affected hundreds of families and leaders should preach peace and unity, instead of using the bandit attacks to campaign. They should not incite violence, he said.Pkosing cautioned residents against electing leaders who do not champion peace.
