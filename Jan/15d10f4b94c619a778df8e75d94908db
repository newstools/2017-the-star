Embu Senator Lenny Kivuti has criticised Governor Martin Wambora for denying the deputy governor crucial roles.He pledged to give his deputy governor executive powers if elected governor. Kivuti said Wambora has not allowed Dorothy Nditi any powers in his government.This has led to Nditi only &ldquo;reading newspapers as she has nothing to do&rdquo;.The senator said if elected, he will ensure his running mate, former Manyatta MP Emilio Kathuri, becomes an executive deputy Governor.He said he will give Kathuri the role of supervising executives in the county government and all county projects. Kivuti said he carries out consultative, participatory and transformative leadership in the institutions that he heads, which he says leads to success.&ldquo;Instead of being like a certain individual who got a deputy governor whose work is to read newspapers in the office, I&rsquo;ll have a deputy governor who will work,&rdquo; he said. Kivuti told Kathuri to prepare to work, adding that he will be tasked with ensuring services and projects are implemented.The senator said he will ensure he fulfills his pre-election pledges. He made the remarks at Kiangima Girls Secondary School in Embu West subcounty, when he met more than 300 aspirants for various political seats who will be supporting his campaigns.Kivuti said during his time as senator he has been working with all elected MPs in Embu county, which helped him implement a lot of national government projects, including four mega irrigation dams, whose tendering is in the process.He said he was the chairperson of the Embu leaders&rsquo; forum while he was Siakago MP and several successful projects were initiated.Kivuti, who was with Kathuri, said if elected governor, the first thing he would do is take the county elected leaders for a seminar to strategise on what they will do for residents. He urged the aspirants to mobilise voters to register.
