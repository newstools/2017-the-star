Machakos Senator Johnson Muthama has accused President Uhuru Kenyatta of failing to take action on National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale who has allegedly threatened the Kambas. He said the President has done nothing to tame Duale, &ldquo;who is his dog&rdquo;. Muthama said several people, including himself, have in the past spent nights in the cell over alleged hate speech. &ldquo;This is impunity. I don&rsquo;t have any problem with Duale, but I have a very big problem with the President, since Duale belongs to him. If he is not going to address this issue, Muthama is here to make sure that he speaks,&rdquo; he said in Migwani, Kitui county, on Saturday. He said Duale has lost all hope of winning again in Garissa, and he is &ldquo;throwing the kicks of a dying donkey&rdquo;. Muthama said Kambas are peaceful people. He said Wiper candidates will meet on Monday at the Bomas of Kenya to decide the way forward, since the Jubilee administration is planning to rig the elections by purporting the electronic voting may fail.
