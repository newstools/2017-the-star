Kenya Electricity Generating Company yesterday extended the four-year term for its managing director Albert Mugo for a year. He was appointed KenGen&rsquo;s CEO in January 2014. The state-owned power producer said Mugo will be overseeing a number of new projects which are at various stages of development, starting with 140MW Olkaria V geothermal project whose construction is expected to start this month. &ldquo;We wish Mugo success and we have no doubt that under his leadership and with the support of the board, management and staff, KenGen will continue to progress in its good to great transformation,&rdquo; chairman Joshua Choge said in a statement. In the past three years, he has overseen the growth of KenGen&rsquo;s generation capacity to installed total capacity of 1,640MW, about 70 per cent of the national generating capacity.
