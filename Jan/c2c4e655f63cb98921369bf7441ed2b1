Public university lecturers have rejected Education CS Fred Matiang'i's request that they suspend their strike for one month to conclude salary talks. Uasu secretary general Constantine Wasonga said the union&rsquo;s national executive council has in its wisdom rejected the request."NEC has rejected the statement of intention from the government until the union signs the delayed 2013/17 CBA," said Wasonga.He added that the lectures want nothing short of a reasonable counter-offer from the government tabled for them to resume teaching."I call upon lecturers to intensify the strike in the coming week.The dons cannot eat statements of intention from the government," he said.This followed revelations that the government had tabled a three per cent counter offer for the university dons to call off the strike.But Wasonga said the union was demanding that structured salaries be harmonised with what civil servants and those in private sector earn, not percentages.On Thursday, Matiang'i implored upon lecturers to suspend the strike to allow joint negotiating committee talks starting Monday."It is important to suspend the strike so that talks are not jeopardised," the Cabinet Secretary said.He also directed Vice Chancellors of public universities not to take disciplinary actions against striking lecturers.Matiang'i said that the ministry of education, treasury and the salaries and remuneration commission will fully be involved.Read: Matiang'i asks lecturers to halt strike until March for negotiationsAlso read: High Court stops lecturers&rsquo; strike scheduled for MondayMore on this: University Students threaten to protest over lecturers, doctors strike But Uasu chairman Muga K&rsquo;Olale said the government's request for suspension was meant to dupe and blackmail the lecturers."We have been patiently waiting for the conclusion of this CBA for a long time," K&rsquo;Olale said.Lecturers fear that the CBA will not be factored in the 2017-18 budget if it is not implemented by March 31.They are demanding that lecturers in the lowest cadre earn Sh350,000, up from Sh99,802, a month. They also want professors paid Sh1.9 million a month, up from Sh211,753.Talks between the Inter Public University Councils Consultative Forum (IPUCCF) and the non-teaching staff unions &ndash;Kusu and Kudheihia- are ongoing.
