There was drama at the Naivasha law courts after a suspect went wild attacking court staff with faeces.Operations at the court were paralysed for close to an hour as the man tore court documents and broke window panes using his bare hands.The suspect identified as Ali Mohammed was later contained and locked at the Naivasha police station.Last week, Mohammed disrupted the proceedings when he first appeared to face drunkenness charges.Naivasha Principal magistrate Esther Kimilu adjourned the seating after he (Mohammed) started screaming and shouting.Today, the shaken magistrate who escaped unhurt had to be whisked to her chambers before the suspect could reach her."More drama ensued in the cells as the screaming man smeared himself with human waste before breaking tens of window panes," he said.Police had to use a horse-pipe to clean up the half-naked suspect before locking him at the Naivasha police station.A witness, Abel Kamau, told how without provocation the suspect jumped over the bar and headed for the magistrate while screaming and shouting."The man tore into pieces various court documents before police managed to contain and take him to the cells," Kamau said.Later the magistrate issued an order that the suspect be taken to the mental institution for the check up before he is charged afresh."The suspect after the mental evaluation will be slapped with fresh charges of causing a breach of peace and malicious damage," said an orderly in the court.Court orderlies had a hard time later cleaning up the human waste that had been smeared all over before collecting the torn court documents.Late last year, a suspect Michael Kaboro attacked Nakuru resident magistrate Eunice Kelli after she sentenced him to three years in jail for assault.Read: Man who stabbed magistrate, two others pleads guilty
