Kitui Senator David Musila says he will not pay rogue contractors awarded tenders irregularly if he becomes governor.&ldquo;All unpaid tenders will be re-evaluated and audited before I authorise payment. If due diligence was not followed, payment will be vetoed,&rdquo; the Wiper party national chairman said on Sunday.Musila addressed congregants at Nzalae Deliverance Church in Mwingi West constituency. He later addressed residents at Nzalae market centre. Musila was accompanied by MP Benard Kitungi and Senate aspirant Enoch Wambua.He said the county has nothing to show for the Sh30 billion it has received since 2013. &ldquo;I will ensure prudent use of funds. Rogue contractors have plundered the county and done shoddy work. Unscrupulous contractors should know their time is up,&rdquo; Musila said. The Wiper national chairman expressed confidence he will win the governor&rsquo;s race. He said he is the people&rsquo;s candidate, and enjoys &ldquo;unparalleled popularity&rdquo; across the county.&ldquo;I know I am older than incumbent Julius Malombe and aspirant Charity Ngilu, but age should not be a factor because it cannot stop me from delivering,&rdquo; Musila said.He added, &ldquo;Americans elected Trump as their President and he is my agemate. Kenyans elected former President Mwai Kibaki when he was old, and he turned out to be one of the best Presidents Kenya has ever had.&rdquo;Musila, who hails from the Mwingi subcounty, denied claims an MoU was signed by Wiper officials to allow Malombe, from Kitui subcounty, run for two terms. &ldquo;There was no such agreement. Those making the claims should provide documentary evidence,&rdquo; he said. Last week, Wiper leader Kalonzo had urged Musila to run for senator and leave the governor seat to Malombe.
