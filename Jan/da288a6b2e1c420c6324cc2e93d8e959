A scientific study will be carried out to establish why Lake Kenyatta in Mpeketoni, Lamu county, is drying up. Environment PS Charles Sunkuli in a statement said the &ldquo;drying up of the lake is worrying.&rdquo;Experts say if action is not taken the lake will dry up in three years.Sunkuli visited the lake on Wednesday for a fact-finding mission. He called for formation of an inter-agency task force to oversee the gazettement of the lake and demarcate the riparian area to address insecurity.He was accompanied by officials from the Environment ministry, National Environment Management Authority, Lamu government, environmentalists and others.Sunkuli said the lake will die if urgent measures are not taken to fight climate change and human activities around the lake.It is on the northern coast, 230km north of Malindi and 60km from Lamu Island. It covers 496 square kilometreshippos, snakes dyingThe lake used to be home to hundreds of hippos and thousands of freshwater snails. But the snails, many snakes and more than 15 hippos have died as the lake dries up.The lake provides water to more than 65,000 residents. Governor Issa Timamy and Deputy Governor Eric Mugo recently toured the area with environmentalists from the World Wide Fund for Nature and members of Lake Kenyatta Water Users Association.Timamy said the biggest problem is the waterways created by animals and residents.John Bett, the acting WWF Coast programme manager, said residents have invaded the wetlands and cultivated land that should be inhabited by animals.He said a significant population depends on the lake for survival, from Mpeketoni to Mkunubi, but little has been done to conserve it.
