When banditry attacks, coupled with inter-clan fights, rocked Kerio Valley in March last year, not many people though they would spill into 2017.However, several attempts to restore peace failed, turning the valley into a region of despair.At least 35 people have been reported dead in the complex security situation. It is a combination of cross-border banditry attacks involving the Pokot bandits and Marakwet herders, and inter-clan feuds among Marakwet rival clans.History of the violenceThe banditry attacks began in March last year, at a time when land disputes among various clans were climaxing, making the Kerio Valley the epicentre of attacks that paralysed activities and left at least 2,000 families displaced.From education to health, agriculture to trade, the deadly clashes paralysed activities, leaving about 10,000 families in abject poverty.Several attempts by local authorities to reconcile the warring communities and clans hit a snag, sparking the beginning of an arduous task of peace seeking.In June, government officials, including Rift Valley regional coordinator Wanyama Musiambo, outlined security plans to return livestock stolen during the series of cattle theft.At that time, at least 1,500 goats and hundreds of cows belonging to Marakwet herders had reportedly been stolen and were being hidden by brazen bandits, who have made the vast Baringo East their haven.Musiambo, in a painful decision, fired two chiefs, accused of contributing to security lapses that exacerbated banditry attacks, plus failing to feed other security agencies with accurate information at the peak of the attacks.&ldquo;We cannot continue working with chiefs who switch their mobile phones off at a time when we need information,&rdquo; Musiambo said.The sacking angered Elgeyo Marakwet leaders, including Governor Alex Tolgos and Endo MCA Festus Kirop, who accused Musiambo of double standards.Tolgos says the regional coordinator should have sacked chiefs from both Elgeyo Marakwet and Baringo county, saying the Marakwet chiefs were sacrificed to satisfy Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery that action was being taken to contain the clashes, instead of finding a lasting solution to the runaway insecurity.He accused the coordinator and his security team of systematically targeting Marakwet chiefs and locals who, he claimed, were victims of banditry attacks. He said the security agencies were leaving the well-known bandits scot-free.&ldquo;It is not possible that chiefs from areas raided by bandits are punished, yet nothing is done to those from areas which attackers are from.We should be seeing chiefs from such areas punished for failing to help the police arrest criminals,&rdquo; Tolgos said.MCA Kirop questioned why police were deployed to the Marakwet side of the valley and none to the Pokot side.He argued that continued deployment of more security agencies in Marakwet would jeopardise pursuit of cattle thieves who vanish with stolen animals to thickets and caves in Baringo East.Use of forceMeanwhile, deadly inter-clan clashes persisted.In one incident, four people were shot dead and 70 houses torched in May, when Kapshoi and Kapsiren clashed.Hostilities between the two clans continued, with one clan cutting water supply to another clan, forcing the Elgeyo Marakwet government to station a water tanker to supply water to the affected clan.A fierce battle between the two clans erupted again in December, leaving three people dead and 25 houses razed.The animosity resulted in Tot trading centre missing clean water since May.Elgeyo Marakwet county commissioner Fredrick Ndambuki warned in October that the state will be forced to use force to tackle a militia that was suspected to be carrying out inter-clan skirmishes in the valley.&ldquo;I have done my part to unite the two clans since March, but unfortunately, diplomacy has failed. It is now my duty to tell the Marakwet community and interested parties to bear with us when we use full force,&rdquo; he said.Ndambuki said the fearless militias have taken control of two areas and given them Somali names.&ldquo;They call them Kismayu one and Kismayu two. They bar security officers from accessing the areas,&rdquo; he said.On the Pokot-Marakwet attacks, Musiambo had pledged to help recover the stolen animals within 48 hours, a promise that was made difficult by escalating, spontaneous attacks.Following the June meetings, he ordered the deployment of 400 security officers, comprising the General Service Unit, Anti-Stock Theft Unit, administration, and regular police in July as the state declared war on bandits.Two armed personnel couriers were also deployed as bandits turned increasingly ruthless.But by September, despite the police deployment, the Kerio Valley was becoming uninhabitable.Women and schoolchildren sought refuge in caves in the Kerio escarpments at a time when schools countrywide were reopening for a crucial third term, a few days to the KCPE and KCSE exams.Mango trade hamperedMango fruit harvesting season was as well setting in, but local farmers were afraid to attend to the fruits. Rotting mangoes were a common sight on Arror-Chesongoch-Tot-Liter road along the valley.Rivalry between the two warring clans further complicated the mango trade, making some businesspeople from as far as Thika, Nairobi and Kisumu to fear buying mangoes in Tot and neighbouring areas for fear of attacks by armed gangs.Attacks against mango traders escalated in November, when a gang opened fire on a lorry transporting mangoes on the Liter-Tot road, injuring three traders from as far as Thika.The attack was reportedly triggered by allegations that the traders were favouring one clan in the buying of mangoes.For Sarah Nduta, 41, Stephen Gichahu, 43, and Tony Wanguru, November 27 is a day they would wish to forget in their lives.It is the day they missed death by a whisker after a criminal gang sprayed 11 bullets on the lorry they were transporting mangoes in at 9pm. They sustained serious gunshot injuries and rushed to Iten County Referral Hospital.What followed the traders&rsquo; attack was massive losses among mango farmers.Paul Cheserek, a local fruit farmer, says he lost Sh1.5 million as his mangoes, tomatoes and watermelon got rotten in the farm as traders fled.The lawlessness was happening even after visits by Deputy President William Ruto, Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery and IG Joseph Boinett in October.Ruto ordered police officers in the area to enhance patrols along the Kerio River, which acts as the border of Elgeyo Marakwet and Baringo counties and asked Boinett to increase to recruit additional 40 police reservists to bolster efforts to restore calm.It became apparent that deployment of security personnel was not yielding fruits in the fight against banditry.December was even worse, as the attacks mutated to motorcycle theft. This came as herders moved their remaining livestock to safer areas of the Kerio escarpment.At least five motorcycles were stolen and ridden towards Baringo East in night robbery incidents. Two boda boda operators were shot dead and scores of passengers wounded.The December attacks happened weeks after interventions by the National Cohesion and Integration Commission failed to restore calm, even after bringing together elders and leaders from the two warring communities.NCIC, through chairman Francis Kaparo, held meetings aimed at uniting the two communities and ending clan fights.Sharp divisions and counter-accusations were palpable during the sessions.Leaders argue, locals sufferPokot leaders, including Tiaty MP Asman Kamama, told the commission in Kolowa, Baringo county, that the Pokot community is viewed as an aggressor, yet it is a few criminals who are causing mayhem in the Kerio Valley.Kamama, who chairs the National Assembly Security Committee, said a few bandits were tainting the image of the Pokot community.He blamed the runaway insecurity on a &lsquo;network&rsquo; of criminals hiding in Baringo East and Marakwet East in the volatile valley, adding the community was condemned without being heard.Kamama said the bandit attacks have impoverished residents.&ldquo;We have lived peacefully with the Marakwet for 14 years. The recent attacks have paralysed age-old barter trade between us,&rdquo; he said.Elgeyo Marakwet leaders told the commission that youth from the community have never crossed to Tiaty constituency for bandit attacks.Led by Senator Kipchumba Murkomen, they said the community has been provoked by the Pokots.&ldquo;NCIC is charged with monitoring hate speeches,&rdquo; Murkomen said. &ldquo;You should summon some of us (politicians) who are moving around inciting locals.&rdquo;Marakwet East MP Kangogo Bowen accused Musiambo of &lsquo;talking tough and acting less&rsquo; in tackling insecurity.&ldquo;You ordered that all stolen animals must be returned by security officials. Where are those animals? You had assured us of establishing police posts in Tiaty. Where are they?&rdquo; he said.Pokot women told tales of how the fights cut food supply, causing starvation since food was obtained in open-air markets that were closed during the skirmishes.Rhoda Chepkonga, a Marakwet woman from Chesongoch, Marakwet East, said children missed schools as mothers made caves on the snake-infested Kerio escarpments.
