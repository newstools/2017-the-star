National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale yesterday said he is not afraid of the ICC because he has been there on several occasions.He was responding to Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka&rsquo;s threat to take him to the Hague.Cord co-principal Kalonzo last week said he would take Duale to the ICC over an inciting audio clip that went viral on social media.In the clip, the person talking urges a group of youths to chase Kambas away from Garissa and not allow them to register as voters in the area.Addressing mourners during former nominated MP Mark Too&rsquo;s burial service in Eldoret town, Duale said, &ldquo;We will not be intimidated by people who want to take us back there.&rdquo; He said he has walked in the ICC 39 times. &ldquo;I know the ICC in and out,&rdquo; Duale said.
