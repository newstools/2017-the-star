Murang&rsquo;a nurses want Governor Mwangi Wairia investigated for allegedly not remitting Sh100 million in statutory deductions. The money was supposed to be handed to the NHIF, NSSF, Helb and others. The nurses said their payslips show the money was deducted from their salaries, but they found out it is never forwarded to the institutions. &ldquo;It has been happening since 2015, only we have not been aware [of it] until members started going for loans and were [turned away] because of the non-payments,&rdquo; branch leader Kenneth Kihatu said on Tuesday.They camped outside the EACC offices in Nairobi the whole day on Tuesday before moving to Uhuru Park. Kihatu said the governor threatened to sack them when they complained. &ldquo; [He] advertised our positions on vernacular stations, including Inooro TV. We are not against the county government and are very diplomatic. Only that they must honour their side of the bargain,&rdquo; he said.Kihatu said some of the money has been withheld since 2013. He said the workers agreed with the county assembly that the money would be paid by December 20.He said the county, through the Finance chief officer, committed to remit the money before thae date, but has not kept its word. Phamarcist Boniface Njoroge said, &ldquo;Deductions from the December salary have not been submitted.&rdquo; Kihatu said, &ldquo;[The] majority of those affected are the health workers because the other ministries have few employees.&rdquo; Njoroge said those who have borrowed sacco loans have zero or negative account balances because their money is deducted twice &mdash; by the county, which does not forward the money, and the sacco itself.
