Konoin MP Sammy Koech on Saturday accused National Water Conservation and Pipeline Corporation chairman Julius Kones, a Bomet governor hopeful, of being a project of some political brokers opposed to a woman&rsquo;s leadership.Koech said his constituents and the entire county fully support Laboso, who will run against the incumbent Isaac Rutto on August 8. He spoke in Sotik, where he urged residents not to be misled. &ldquo;They have also approached me with favours that if I run for governor they will support me,&rdquo; Koech said.But in quick rejoinder, Kones told off Koech, urging him to focus on his affairs, instead of maligning him. He said he has a right to associate with whomever he chooses. &ldquo;My candidature is not in any way driven by any desire from anyone, but that of the people of Bomet. I wonder where the MP draws these claims from,&rdquo; he said.
