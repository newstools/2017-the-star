Nyali MP Hezron Awiti has rejected reports he is a Jubilee mole out to disrupt the opposition.The MP hosted President Uhuru Kenyatta in his constituency on Thursday. He said hospitallity does not make him a traitor.Awiti said working with every leader, irrespective of political affiliation, to bring development to every citizen does not make one a turncoat.Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho has been conspicuously absent from most of Uhuru&rsquo;s functions in Mombasa but Awiti has been attending them, especially in his constituency. Because of this, the MP said, some factions call him a mole. The Nyali MP said this has also contributed to the mole tag. &ldquo;Is it a crime to host a President in a constituency where you were elected? Let&rsquo;s be realistic,&rdquo; Awiti said. He said the rumours are coined to discredit his governor aspirations but he will not back off.
