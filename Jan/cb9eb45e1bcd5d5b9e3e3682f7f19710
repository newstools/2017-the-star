The Fai Sultanate subclan of the Degodia community has rescinded its earlier decision to endorse Ugas Mohamed Sheikh for Wajir governor and instead picked Kenya&rsquo;s ambassador to Saudi Arabia Mohammed Mohamud.The community nominated Sheikh on July 28 last year. Addressing the press in Wajir town on Saturday, Sultan Najib Ugas said the community made the decision after a week of consultations with elders. He was with 14 cabinet members and 11 members of the Degodia Reconciliation Committee. Ugas said they decided to back Mohamud because he is more popular. &ldquo;As a community, we have asked Sheikh to step down in favour of his elder brother. We have advised him to vie for Wajir MP,&rdquo; he said. The envoy was fined Sh1.5 million for disobeying the Sultanate, when he continued with campaigns, even after Sheikh had been selected.&ldquo;Whenever one does a mistake, there are traditional guidelines to be followed in punishing such individuals and his excellency went through the same,&rdquo; Sultan Najib said.Speaking after the ceremony, Idiris Abdullahi, the clan&rsquo;s nominee for the Tarbaj MP seat, said the community will always remain loyal to the Sultanate. The Fai clan is one of the largest single voting blocs in the county and its unity is likely to redefine the county&rsquo;s political direction. Mohamud emerged second in the 2013 election with more than 35,000 votes behind Governor Ahmed Abdullahi, who had 41,000 votes.
