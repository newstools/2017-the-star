The Murang&rsquo;a government will not guarantee or approve loans for any health workers as the doctors strike enters day 39.In a letter to all health staff and copied to banks and saccos, county secretary Jacob Muthamia said, &ldquo;Be informed that effective January 10, 2017, the Murang&rsquo;a county government will not guarantee or approve loans and credit facilities for any officer working under the Health Department.&rdquo;Health workers countrywide stopped going to work on December 5 last year, demanding that the June 2013 CBA be implemented. They want promotions, salary hikes, better working environment and hiring of more medics.In Murang&rsquo;a, the medics cited mistreatment by the county in November.Majority patients have been transferred to private hospitals.Medical services have been disrupted in the county, particularly in Murang&rsquo;a County Hospital, since the beginning of this year after workers vowed not to return to work until their deductions are remitted.Last week, nurses camped outside the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission offices demanding they investigate Governor Mwangi Wairia for allegedly not remitting Sh100 million in statutory deductions. The money was supposed to be remitted to the NHIF, NSSF, Helb and other institutions.The nurses said their payslips show the money was deducted from their salaries, but they found out it is not forwarded to the institutions.Kenya National Union of Nurses Murang&rsquo;a branch leader Kenneth Kihatu said Wairia threatened to sack them when they complained about the money and the county even advertised their positions.He said some of the money has been withheld since 2013.Kihatu said the county assembly agreed to pay the money by December 20.County government officials on the other hand blame non-remittance of medics&rsquo; deductions to failure of systems that wire the money to various organisations.
