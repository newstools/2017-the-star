Kerio Valley residents have accused police of laxity following the killing of one person by Pokot bandits on Sunday.The victim, 34-year-old Justin Chemweno, was a cousin of Kerio Valley Development Authority CEO David Kimosop. Tunyo division resident Philaris Kibet said police officers have been telling them they wait for &ldquo;orders from above&rdquo; whenever they are called to repulse armed bandits. &ldquo;We frantically called the police for help when fighting broke out on Sunday. The bandits attacked herders for three hours and there were no police officers in sight,&rdquo; Kibet said during a peace meeting at Arror, Marakwet West, on Monday. Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen, Governor Alex Tolgos, Marakwet West MP William Kisang and Kimosop were present. Area police boss Apollo Anyonyi was jeered when he attempted to defend the security agencies. &ldquo;Can you tell us what your officers mean by orders from above, when they have all the machinery to end crime?&rdquo; Kibet said.
