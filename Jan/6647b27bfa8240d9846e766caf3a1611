Three time New York City marathon queen Mary Keitany will be chasing a hat-trick when she lines up for the London Marathon in April.She is keen on replicating the New York feat in London and though she was eyeing the crown last year, she only managed to finish ninth after falling down on the course.Keitany achieved her back to back win at the 2011 and 2012 London marathon clocking 2:18.37 national record time in the latter but finished second in 2015.&ldquo;I am very happy that I have won New York three times and I am also targeting a third title in London. After falling down last year, I tried recovering in order to catch up with the rest but I couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said.The athlete who set the 2009 world half marathon record before her neighbour Florence Kiplagat broke it said she has been training for the race.&ldquo;I am not new there and having mastered the course, I think it will favour me through a tactful run. So far my training is good,&rdquo;she said.In London she will face Olympic marathon champion Jemimah Sumgong, world marathon silver medallist Helah Kiprop, Florence Kiplagat and Vivian Cheruiyot who will be making her marathon debut.But she will compete at the Ras Al Khaimah Half (RAK) marathon in February for build up.It is at the RAK where Keitany set the 1:05.50 former world half marathon mark.&ldquo;Endurance and speed matter a lot in marathon and I will use the RAK half marathon as my testing ground in February,&rdquo;she said.Last year she set a course record of 30:45 at the Beach To Beacon 10km at Cape Elizabeth in the United States of America.Keitany earned her first international half marathon victory in 2006 winning the Sevilla Half Marathon in Spain before scooping the San Silvestre Olivais 10km in Barcelona the same year.She had a fruitful outing the following year securing three half marathon wins and a 15km victory on the international stage.On Team Kenya&rsquo;s assignments, she appeared at the 2007 World road running Championships in Italy finishing second in the half marathon and winning the world half marathon championships in 2009 in England.She represented Kenya at the 2012 London Olympics finishing fourth in the marathon after clocking 2:23.56.
