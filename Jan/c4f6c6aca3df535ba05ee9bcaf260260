Gospel singer Jimmy Gait made a grand and calculated re-entry into the music industry after a long hiatus. He released Cool Your Temper and a few weeks later announced that he had bagged an endorsement deal with one of the top hotels in town. Jimmy Gait is a man with a strategy.However, the Muhadhara hitmaker has been accused by one of his service providers of failing to pay for a job done back in 2015.The complaint was posted on a Telegram channel that outs cons, dead beats and randy men.It read: "Hello, kindly help me expose a con gospel artist Jimmy Gait. I did an online marketing campaign for him in August 2015 on a local website, he was marketing a project where he was giving out motorcycles to his fans as a way of giving back to the society. The promotion was for one month and to date he hasn't paid 20K of which we had agreed for the entire month campaign. Till to date he doesn't pick up my calls or reply to texts with all sorts of excuses. (sic)"The post was accompanied with the following screenshots...His PR team told Word Is,these allegations are especially confusing because just a few weeks ago reports of Jimmy Gait dishing out Sh 20,000 to his fans flooded the internet.Responding to the allegations Jimmy Gait exclusively told Word Is, &ldquo;I am more of a creative so sometimes I lose sight of some small administrative issues. It&rsquo;s really unfortunate that someone would go public with something we were already handling privately. Everybody falls behind sometimes, in my life I have had many ups and downs but I always come out ontop. I have dealt with this issue it is now behind me, I am focusing on the future. I am working on some new exciting things that I will be announcing soon.&rdquo;
