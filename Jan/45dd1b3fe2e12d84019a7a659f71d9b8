Anyone in Butere bringing a friend to register to vote will be rewarded with Sh50 for every new voter.Marama West MCA Habil Nanjendo yesterday launched the Sh50 reward scheme and he will personally pay.Registration is very low.Nanjendo urged elected leaders to mobilise everyone to register. He said the subcounty may fail to hit the 87,000-voter target by end of the registration on February 14 if leaders do not act. &ldquo;When you lead your friend to register as a voter in any part of Butere, call me from the registration centre so I can send my personal assistant to give you your Sh50. The greater the number of voters, the more you will get,&rdquo; he said in Bumamu. &ldquo;I have visited all registration centres and realised the number registering is very low. Some centres are recording seven people per day. Others just four.&rdquo;
