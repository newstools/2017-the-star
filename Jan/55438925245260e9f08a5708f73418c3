Stray Lions thrashed Kongonis by 101 runs in the opening match of the 2017 Nairobi Provincial Cricket Association (NPCA) Twenty 20 league yesterday.Ugandan opening batsman Roger Mukasa produced an outstanding performance with the bat, scoring a quick-fire 74 to lead his new side to 219 for 4. Lions elected to bat first and some fine fielding and bowling saw them restrict the Kongonis to 118 for four. Mukasa, who was signed by the club alongside another Ugandan international Charles Waiswa, made an indelible mark in the match with superb batting that led his side to the final total.His 74 runs came from 51 balls with three sixes and 10 fours. He shared an opening stand of 82 runs with Jay Mehta before Dola Aballa ended the threatening stand with the dismissal of Mehta on 32 from 18 balls. Mukasa lost Abraham Vadada immediately for three and then Collins Obuya for the same score to leave them on103 for three after 11.4 overs.Mukasa then went on to share another impressive stand with Shem Obado that lifted the scores to 159 before his long and threatening stay on the crease was brought to an end by Tony Ochieng, who had him bowled with 26 balls to play. Obado and another new player at Stray Lions Neil Narvekar then finished off the remaining balls by adding on 60 runs. Obado scored 52 from 24 balls while Narvekar posted 35 from 14 balls. Ochieng was Kongonis top bowler with 2 for 44. Kongonis&rsquo; hope of saving the match quickly dissolved when they were reduced to 26 for 3 by the sixth over. While Eugene Maneno and Dominic Wesonga provided some resistance, scoring 52 from 47 and 40 from 37 balls respectively, they had little support and Kongonis only managed 118 for 4 as Jay Chandarana, Waiswa and Obado exploited favourable bowling conditions.Childs was the first to fall for a duck with the board on zero. Angas Kholi and Edward Gangashame only made 15 before Gangashame became Chandarana&rsquo;s second wicket. Kholi was third to fall after being bowled out by Waiswa on 16 runs. Maneno and Wesonga then lifted the scores to a hundred mark with a fourth wicket stand of 82 runs in 13.2 overs. Obado broke the stand when he bowled Maneno with 11 balls to play.
