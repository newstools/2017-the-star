Musalia Mudavadi has said ineptitude on President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto's part lead to Amina Mohamed's failure to clinch the AUC chairperson seat.Mudavadi said Amina should have won the seat because of her experience."It is disappointing that after so much energy, national resources and hope expended in pursuit of the (position) Kenya should emerge crestfallen," the ANC leader said in a statement on Tuesday.Mudavadi said it was clear that AU members are cautious of Kenya's descent to isolationism, especially its international diplomacy."The AU must have been forewarned that Amina's candidature wasn't in its best interests, but a misplaced ego trip by Kenya's rulers to use the position for self-aggrandisement," he said."Regional and international diplomacy isn&rsquo;t your usual cup of domestic posturing; it requires seasoned, erudite planning and engineering to which it is apparent, the Jubilee regime wasn&rsquo;t prepared for,&rdquo; the ANC leader added.He said it is a well-known traditional consensus within the AU diplomacy that the commission chairmanship is rotational between regions and among Anglophone and Francophone states AU states."To have fielded an Anglophone candidate to succeed an immediate Anglophone without sufficiently lobbying the evident Francophone beneficiaries wasn&rsquo;t a diplomatically astute thing to do. That disadvantage alone should have forewarned Kenya against fielding a candidate," he said.The Foreign Affairs CS lost the Monday vote for African Union Commission chairperson to Chad&rsquo;s Moussa Mahamat.Her loss was a big blow to Kenya as it had been said that the African leaders were receptive of Amina's candidature.More on this: Amina loses African Union Commission chair vote to Chad's MahamatAmina accused Africa of being divide along language lines and said the election left the continent more divided than ever."Kenya has to interrogate claims that some of its neighbours did not stand with it in the vote," the Cabinet Secretary told the media in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia on Tuesday.
