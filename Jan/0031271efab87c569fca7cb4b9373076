NIC Bank has partnered with bancassurance subsidiary NIC Insurance Agents in a bid to share the spoils in marine insurance following the implementation of Section 20 of the Insurance Act, the mid-tier lender announced yesterday. Before the rule to insure all imports locally was enforced in January, about 90 per cent of cargo import insurance was under foreign firms. &ldquo;We cover risks associated with fire, theft and robbery, accidents, water damage, war-related perils, strikes, terrorism and political violence,&rdquo; bank&rsquo;s executive director Alan Dodd said in Nairobi.The bank hosted a sensitisation breakfast on marine insurance yesterday.
