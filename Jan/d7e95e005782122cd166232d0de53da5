Five Ukambani MPs yesterday said they will deliver the region&rsquo;s vote to President Uhuru Kenyatta on August 8. They are Mwingi Central MP Joe Mutambu, Mwingi North&rsquo;s John Munuve, Regina Ndambuki (Kilome), Rachael Nyamai (Kitui South) and Victor Munyaka (Machakos Town).They said they will carry out strong campaigns for Uhuru&rsquo;s reelection bid.The MPs spoke during the Jubilee delegates&rsquo; meeting in Kasarani.Mutambu said the National Super Alliance announced by the opposition on Tuesday lacks the numbers to beat the Jubilee Party, regardless of who they choose as their presidential candidate. Unity among Raila Odinga, Kalonzo Musyoka, Musalia Mudavadi and Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula is not a threat to Jubilee, he said. &ldquo;I am an engineer by training and very good at mathematics. I know two plus three is five and three plus two is five. I know Raila&rsquo;s votes, Kalonzo&rsquo;s, Mudavadi&rsquo;s and everyone&rsquo;s. I know their numbers and numbers don&rsquo;t lie,&rdquo; Mutambu said. The leaders praised Uhuru for Ukambani projects. Munuve said tarmac roads were built in his constituency for the first time during the Jubilee administration.&ldquo;I represent Kyuso, Muumoni, Tseikuru [Kalonzo&rsquo;s home area] and Ngomeni and all the people there are in Jubilee,&rdquo; he said.
