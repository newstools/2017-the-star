Chief Justice David Maraga on Wednesday presided over the opening of a High Court in Kabarnet and installed its first judge.While unveiling the 38th High Court station in Kenya, Maraga said the court is expected to speed up the delivery of justice and to decongest the Eldoret High Court."The law requires that a High Court be established in every county in line with devolution, now there are now only nine counties without these facilities," he said.Read: Mutunga unveils plan for High Courts in countiesCJ Maraga further urged the community not to rush into taking every dispute to court and advocated for Alternative Dispute Resolution to resolve small disputes."This will de-congest courts and promote peace," he said, lauding the establishment of Baringo Council of Elders who deal with small disputes in a structured manner. He however warned that cases of defilement and underage marriage should always be prosecuted in court. "These cases should be brought to court, so that if found guilty, the perpetrators are imprisoned and removed from the community," he said. The CJ also emphasized on the preparedness of Judiciary to handling any conflict arising from the general elections in August."Judiciary is well prepared to handle disputes arising from the General Elections. Judicial officers have been well trained and infrastructure put in place to handle the disputes," he said.Baringo Governor Benjamin Cheboi backed the CJ saying it is high time Kenyans should engage in free and fair elections."I would suggest that anybody caught stealing someone&rsquo;s animal with a gun should be treated similar with the case of robbery with violence," said CheboiCJ Maraga was accompanied by Chief Registrar Ann Amadi, Judges Joseph Sergon and Cecilia Kitua of Nyeri and Eldoret High courts respectively and Baringo county commissioner Peter Okwanyo.Also read: 14 new High Court stations
