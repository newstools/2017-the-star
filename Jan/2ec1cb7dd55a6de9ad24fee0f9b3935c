Bungoma Deputy Governor Hillary Chongwony and former Mt Elgon MP Fred Kapondi have for the second time engaged in a bitter verbal exchange, which almost degenerated into blows. In a meeting convened by Governor Kenneth Lusaka on Sunday at his Webuye home, where he called all Jubilee Party aspirants from Mt Elgon, Kapondi and Chongwony argued bitterly, forcing the governor to intervene. A source told the Star trouble started when Kapondi said Chongwony should be replaced as the county Jubilee secretary. He further asked Lusaka to replace Chongwony as deputy governor with another politician from the Sabaot community. &ldquo;Chongwony could no longer take in Kapondi&rsquo;s utterances and he went straight to him, ready to fight,&rdquo; the source said. A few months ago, Kapondi accused Chongwony of failing to serve the interests of the Sabaots. The deputy governor on the other hand, accused Kapondi of not respecting him and working with Ford Kenya to undermine his administration.
