The final mass voter registration for the General Election scheduled for August 8 takes place from January 16 to February 15.Every Kenyan who is eligible to vote should register.According to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission&rsquo;s last numbers following the two mass voter registration drives of 2016, there are 15.9 million registered voters in Kenya today.The Jubilee Party&rsquo;s strongholds of Mt Kenya, Rift Valley, Upper Eastern and half each of Northeastern and Nairobi have 8.7 million registered voters.The Cord strongholds of Nyanza, Western, Ukambani, Coast and half each of Nairobi and Northeastern have 7.2 million registered voters.According to the IEBC, the ruling JP has 1.1 million more registered voters than the massed Opposition.Jubilee needs to register more voters and Cord, which is meeting today at the iconic Bomas of Kenya, needs to seal this large gap and exceed it.The idea is 100 per cent registration and a 100 per cent turnout in a context of 100 per cent peace.
