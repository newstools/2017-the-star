Elected leaders from Nyanza are to blame for the low voter registration turnout, an activist has said.Kisumu City Residents Voice Association chairman Audi Ogada (pictured) yesterday said the leaders were not keen on voter listing.&ldquo;Some are deliberately boycotting voter registration. They should tell us if they are against our ambition to win the presidency,&rdquo; he said. Ogada criticised Kisumu MCAs who &ldquo;abandoned&rdquo; the registration in favour of a Sh15 million boding retreat in Tanzania. He said the more than 10 MCAs did not attend the retreat, despite pocketing Sh260,000 each.Ogada said the timing of the trip, just when the IEBC had raised the red flag on low turnout, is suspect. Muhoroni MP Onyango Koyoo and former Kisumu Mayor Sam Okello echoed his sentiments. They said leaders and residents must get serious to make opposition leader Raila Odinga Kenya&rsquo;s next President. &ldquo;We must stop the culture of taking Raila to State House with words instead of action. The best and only tool is to register and vote for him,&rdquo; Koyoo said. Okello said it is time to show Raila the whole community is behind him.
