Taveta MP Naomi Shaban has shelved her plans to retire from active politics and will instead defend her parliamentary seat. The National Assembly deputy majority leader had last year announced she will not defend her seat and will instead focus her energy in campaigning for President Uhuru Kenyatta at the Coast. This is the third term Shaban is serving as an MP. However, she seems to have bowed to pressure from the constituents who have been urging her to extend her term due to her good development track record. Her allies on Sunday said the MP will defend her seat on a Jubilee Party ticket. Last year, Shaban told the Star her constituents have been reaching out to her, requesting her to defend her seat. But Jubilee Party parliamentary aspirant Mike Banton yesterday said he is not aware that Shaban will defend the seat.
