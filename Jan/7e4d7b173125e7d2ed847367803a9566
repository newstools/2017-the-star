Three nominated senators have urged youth and women to turn out in large numbers and register as voters.Speaking to the Star yesterday, senators Martha Wangari, Joy Gwendo and Beatrice Elachi (pictured) said youth and women should take advantage of the exercise and enlist to participate in the August elections.Wangari, who is eyeing the Gilgil parliamentary seat, said the youth and women should register and exercise their democratic right to choose their preferred leaders .&ldquo;This is our time as youth and women to turn out in large numbers to register. I appeal to you to register as voters during this registration period so that we vote in leaders who can fulfil their development promises,&rdquo; Wangari said.Gwendo urged the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission to continue with civic education to educate Kenyans on the importance of registering and voting.Gwendo is also eyeing the Kisumu East parliamentary seat. She urged youth and women not to wait until the last minute to come out to register. &ldquo;As much as we have 30 days to register, it is important to register now rather than waiting until the last minute. We have been given an opportunity and a challenge to bring change through the ballot but we can only vote if we register,&rdquo; Gwendo said.Elachi, who serves as the Senate majority whip, said there are millions of uncollected IDs in government offices. She asked the youth to collect them in readiness for the August polls. She said Jubilee Party is banking on the youth and women to win the election. Elachi said they must be allowed to &ldquo;have a say on how their country is governed&rdquo;.She added, &ldquo;It is important for everyone to have an ID because you cannot register as a voter without it. To all Jubilee supporters at the grassroots, this is a call to duty. Your party and your nation need you. Identify our people who have not registered and ensure they do so.&rdquo;
