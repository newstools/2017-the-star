The Central Bank of Kenya has not been stopped from disbursing funds to the depositors of the collapsed Imperial Bank, the court said yesterday.Justice George Odunga said he did not bar the CBK and the Kenya Deposit Insurance Corporation, Diamond Trust Bank, Kenya Commercial Bank, Josephine Ogweno and Associates and NIC Bank from disbursing funds to the depositors.&ldquo;In other words this court only restated the legal and constitutional position that the actions of the respondents must bow to the due process of the law and nothing else,&rdquo; he said.The judge made the clarifications after the depositors of the collapsed bank urged the court to interpret the orders it issued on November 4 last year. The court had on the said date prohibited the CBK and the KDIC from taking steps that would result in the liquidation of Imperial Bank. In the landmark ruling, Odunga said the CBK and the KDCI should not drive the bank into liquidation until options of reviving the bank have been considered.He said the CBK and the KDIC should consider any reasonable proposals by the shareholders to revive the bank. If suggestions are not viable, Odunga said the CBK should explain to the shareholders why they were not considered, saying they should not be ignored without fair hearing.Yesterday, the judge said it cannot stop the CBK and the KDIC from carrying out their statutory mandate. However, such mandate had to comply with the law and the Constitution, in particular Article 47 of the constitution.&ldquo;Although the CBK and the KDIC could legally take actions whose effect would result in adversely affecting the interests of the depositor, such actions had to be strictly within the confines of the law and the constitution,&rdquo; he said.Odunga said the CBK and the KDIC were under an obligation to consider any reasonable and viable proposals or recovery plans put forward by the depositors towards the revival of the normal business of the bank.One of the depositors, Josephine Awino and Associates, said the KDIC in accordance with the orders of the court issued in November last year announced IBL shareholders failed to provide adequate assurances to implement a proposal that would enable the lifting of the receivership, re-opening of the bank, and resumption of normal activities for its customers.The KDIC made the statement through a press release which further stated that it would continue with the processes that were suspended by the court, and in particular the NIC Bank contract review, which is expected to lead to a structured access to the remaining deposits by the depositors.It was then that the depositors issued a press statement on November 10, claiming that the judgement and orders of the court were distorted and misinterpreted by the KDIC and in particular the orders issued did not permit the continuation of the agreement with the NIC Bank to assume certain assets and liabilities of the bank in receivership.
