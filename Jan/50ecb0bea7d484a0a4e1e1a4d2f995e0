The Abagusii Cultural and Development Council yesterday condemned the lynching of two elderly women in Nyamira South subcounty last week over witchcraft claims.Yesterday, chairman James Matundura urged villagers not to take the law into their own hands.&ldquo;Legal action should be taken against those involved. They are well known,&rdquo; he said. Pauline Mogambi, 95, and her daughter Mary Mogambi, 40, were lynched on January 14 in Omokonge village. The two were accosted by villagers after a book bearing names of supposed witches was found in their house. The book also had names of people they had allegedly killed, and those targeted. Matundura said, &ldquo;I cannot understand why people wait for a woman to reach 95 years old, then claim she killed people,&rdquo; Matundura said.
