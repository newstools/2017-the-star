Two DCI officers suspected to have shot dead a patient at Mwingi Level-4 Hospital last August were released on Sh2 million bond each by the Kitui High Court on Tuesday. Justice Lillian Mutende rejected the prosecution&rsquo;s request that they be held in remand because their case had elicited serious public interest. The victim of a gunshot was shot dead in his bed, causing an uproar over security. Gilbert Maina and Paul Odoyo face trial for the murder of Fredrick Ngandi Musyimi. They denied the charge but were remanded until Tuesday. The prosecution was led by state counsel Martin Wanjala. The case will come up for hearing on February 1. The prosecution was ordered to provide the defence with all witness statements and other evidence it intends to use. Two other DCI officers listed as co-accused - Samuel Thuku and Vincent Maina - for whom an arrest warrant had been issued, failed to show up.
