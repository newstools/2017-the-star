Garissa Governor Nathif Jama has urged the IEBC to send its registration clerks to water points so they can list pastoralists as voters.He said members of the pastoralist communities in Northen Kenya could miss out on the voter registration if this is not done. Addressing the press after officially opening Tana Gardens Hotel, a two-star hotel in Garissa town, Jama said his county will closely work with the electoral agency to ensure they record a high turnout.He said voter registration has come at a bad time when pastoralists are experiencing one of the worst droughts to befall the region in recent years.Jama said this has forced many residents to move with their animals in search of water and pasture.&ldquo;Our people are moving far and wide looking for water and pasture for their animals,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;We feel if something is not done to have these people register from where they are, a big number will be left out of the exercise and it will not be good.&rdquo;Jama said his administration will meet IEBC officials to organise how registration can be done from where potential voters are.He urged residents with identity cards to register en masse, saying it is the only tool they can use to determine who become their leaders.&ldquo;It makes no sense for one to claim to support a particular candidate, yet he has no vote. The only two days that your person needs you is during the voter registration day and the voting day,&rdquo; Jama said.The county chief appealed to the national government to speed up deregistration of Kenyans whose fingerprints were captured in the refugee database and issue them with ID cards so they can register as voters. Jama said without this, many potential voters will be disenfranchised.The IEBC targets 9 million new voters. Releasing the voter registration schedule in Nairobi on Sunday, IEBC CEO Hezra Chiloba said the commission has used the best criteria to distribute BVR kits so no potential voters are disadvantaged because of long distances.
