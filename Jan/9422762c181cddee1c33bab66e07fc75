The Communications Authority of Kenya will revoke the licences and frequency spectrum of television and radio broadcasters that allow politicians to incite violence and spread hate speech through their media.CA board chairman Ngene Gituku on Thursday warned broadcasters against violating the Programming Code for free-to-air radio and television services that came into effect on July 1, 2016.The code defines &lsquo;election period&rsquo; to mean the period between publication of a notice by the electoral body for a presidential, parliamentary or county election and the gazettement of the election results. According to the code, radio and television broadcasters have an obligation to serve the public interest at all times. This includes equitablecoverage and opportunities to registered political parties during polls. &ldquo;As Kenya approaches the general election in 2017, the Communications Authority of Kenya wishes to remind broadcasters on the regulatory provisions governing the responsible use of broadcasting platforms,&rdquo; Gituku said.&ldquo;The Authority expects the broadcasters to abide by the provisions in the Code ... This is not only a legal requirement but also the public responsibility of the media to uphold the democratic principles of our nation, particularly during the election period,&rdquo; he added.
