The Kenya Swimming Federation (KSF) elections are slated for June 3.The national polls to be preceded by regional-cum-county elections will take place on April 29. The dates were announced over the weekend during a Special General Meeting at YMCA over the weekend.The elections come in the wake of the retirement of long serving KSF chairman Ben Ekumbo earlier this month. Also agreed at the meeting was the formation of a seven-man committee to look into the KSF constitution. They include four lawyers Wambui Kibicho, Sanjeer Kharam, Ben Mukuria and Njeri Njoroge and businessman Steve Ndonga. The Nairobi Amateur Swimming Association (NASA) are expected to send two of their representatives to the committee.The work of the committee will be to align the new KSF constitution to the Sports Act. However, members who will sit on the constitution committee will not vie for any electoral national positions in a move aimed at guard against any conflict of interest.The constitutional committee would consult widely and seek the views of all stakeholders wherever they might be in Kenya to ensure unity. The committee is expected to present a revised final draft on March 25 during the Special General Meeting for consideration by the stakeholders.Conrad Thorpe has been proposed to head a transitional committee and stakeholders have 7 working days to come up with the names of the 10 more representatives.
