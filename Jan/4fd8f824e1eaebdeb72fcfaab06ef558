Residents of Adu Kamale village in Magarini, Kilifi county on Thursday received piped water for the first time since independence.This was through a Sh37 million investment by the county government in line with a 2013 pledge made by Governor Amason Kingi.The governor, born and brought up at Adu Kamale - one of the remotest parts of Kilifi, said the residents will no longer drink water from seasonal rivers.He said the long-distance walk in search for water and reliance on shallow wells will now be a thing of the past."We lived a tough life, leaving school at 4 pm to search for water. During our election, I made a commitment to ensure piped water is accessible here," he said.Water will be supplied from six boreholes through a pipeline to a 250,000-litre reservoir and pumped at the rate of 20,000 litres per hour to various water kiosks.The governor said that he has also fulfilled a promise of upgrading impassible roads in the area as well as constructing a dispensary to enable residents get health services.Present at the launch of the project was Senator Stewart Madzayo, MCAs and local leaders.Residents who spoke said the water project was like a dream come true as it will end the hardships they have always gone through in search for water.Read: Hungry Kilifi locals stare at water crisisAlso read: E-water project cuts waste and eases drought in Ganze
