President Uhuru Kenyatta has joined other leaders in mourning former nominated MP Mark Too, who died on December 31. Too, 64, died after a short illness at St Luke's Hospital in Eldoret town."Mark was a jovial easy-going character who fully embraced humility," Uhuru said in a statement on Saturday. He expressed his condolences to Too&rsquo;s family, saying "God will grant them the strength to endure this loss."Too served as an assistant minister in President Daniel Moi's government. He resigned in 2001 to pave way for Uhuru's nomination to Parliament.Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka said Too was "a politician of no mean repute who mostly worked behind the scenes to either build difficult political bridges, or to mend hitherto irredeemably broken ones". "Ever cool and diplomatic," he said of Too.Amani leader Musalia Mudavadi said Too was a friend who helped many over some hard times through mediation and negotiations. "He was always the first to try and solve a political conflict wherever it appeared. Mark trusted that human beings were naturally born good who could be made better," he said.
