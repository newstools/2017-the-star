The Kenya Veterinary Association wants the government to ban the importation of poultry from Uganda following the outbreak of avian flu.This is after tests done on tens of dead birds found on Lutembe beach in Lake Victoria and near Entebbe have turned positive for the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza.Uganda's ministry for agriculture said last Sunday it had detected bird flu in two locations, one affecting wild birds and another hitting domestic birdsKVA noted that the fight to deal with the disease faced major challenges due to the illegal movement of the poultry and their products into the country from Uganda.More on this: Uganda detects bird flu in wild, domestic birdsNational chair Samuel Kahariri said the government must put in a strong animal disease surveillance system, particularly in the hot spots.&ldquo;The law enforcement agencies must be extra vigilant to curb the illegal movement of poultry and their products in Kenya,&rdquo; he said on Tuesday.Kahariri called for the procurement of protective gear to avert possible infection and deaths of veterinary doctors and other high risk personnel during the execution of the exercise.He also asked practitioners and poultry farmers to enhance early warning system.He said that counties bordering Uganda must hold emergency meetings and lay strategies on how to prevent passage of the disease through the common border. &ldquo;The government must urgently solve the ongoing crisis in the health sector to cushion Kenyans from the possible distressing health and economic situation,&rdquo; he said.He challenged county governments to make sure that they had enough personnel and drugs to deal with any outbreak.&ldquo;Veterinary services currently have less than 50 per cent of the requisite labour force out of which about 35 per cent will be due for retire in the next 3 years,&rdquo; he said. Kahariri said that this was the first time the avian flu has broken out in the region.He asked members of the public to desist from touching or eating dead birds or other wild animals as this was one way of spreading the deadly virus.&ldquo;Members of the public should instead report (dead birds and wildlife) to the nearest veterinary authority,&rdquo; he added.
