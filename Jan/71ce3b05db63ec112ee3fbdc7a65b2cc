Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto&rsquo;s Chama Cha Mashinani party has more than 70,000 members from the county, but wants to list 180,000 more in two weeks before the close of registration.The party leader said the membership numbers are a result of an intensive recruitment drive by CCM agents.Recruitment countrywide is ongoing, he said. But he did not say how many members the party has countrywide and how many more it targets to register.&ldquo;This is a Mashinani zone and you can even see the way we are recruiting members. Residents are defecting en masse to our new party ... Those working for Jubilee here in Bomet should now regard themselves as being in the opposition,&rdquo; he said.Rutto said he will take legal action against the chiefs and county commissioner Bernard Leparmarai for allegedly interfering with CMM membership registration.
