It&rsquo;s summer in South Africa and while the summer school holidays are ending and many people who had taken leave from work over the festive season are now back at work, the country&rsquo;s 2,500km of coastline are still the place to be if you want to get away from it all.One of the things I love about living in Cape Town is the fact that I have never lived more than 30 minutes to the beach. In fact, I was once fortunate enough to live within sight of the sea and just 10 minutes&rsquo; walk away from the nearest beach.Whenever I needed a break, I just had to cross a couple of busy streets before I found myself on Cape Town&rsquo;s Atlantic Seaboard&rsquo;s magnificent beachfront promenade. It is similar to the promenade on Lamu Island or a small strip I once visited in Old Town Mombasa. This area is separated from the roadside pavement and buildings by a wide green lawn.Every time I walked here I thought of what a different experience the Kenyan coastline would be, especially in towns such as Malindi and Mombasa, would be if those behind town planning in those places had not succumbed to the pressure of hoteliers and private developers.Up and down the Kenyan coast, hotels and private developers have annexed beaches and access to the sea for most beach users, especially the local ones, leaving Jomo Kenyatta Public Beach as the only accessible beach in Mombasa, for instance.This problem has been so ingrained for so long that even Kenya&rsquo;s Truth Justice and Reconciliation Commission campaigned for the reversal of circumstances that had landed public access beach roads and boat landing access in private hands.If Kenya is serious about seeking international certification for her beaches to enable them measure up to competitors in other countries such as South Africa, then it is of utmost importance that beach access be opened up to all without fear or favour.Interested parties should beware that in 2016, 58 Blue Flags are flying at SA coastal sites, and this includes at 45 beaches, five marinas and eight sustainable tourism boats.The Blue Flag is an international annual award given to beaches that meet a standard of excellence in the areas of safety, amenities, cleanliness, environmental information and management.Believe you me, and I&rsquo;m looking at you Tourism CS Najib Balala, providing world-class beach facilities in a country such as Kenya where beach tourism is an important part of our &lsquo;brand&rsquo; would be a great tool for marketing. And offering tourists, both domestic and foreign, opportunities to choose destinations that have Blue Flag beaches will certainly help improve Kenya&rsquo;s competitiveness in the global market.
