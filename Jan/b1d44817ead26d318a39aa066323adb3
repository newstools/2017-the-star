Kenya has no plans to shut down the internet before, during or after the general election in August, the Communications Authority said yesterday.The Authority officials made the statement in response to reporters' questions at a briefing on what is expected of broadcasters covering the August 8 polls."We are using all possible means not to reach a level where the country can be in tension and force us maybe to take a drastic step," director general Francis Wangusi told the media at CA headquarters. The statement comes at a time when cases of hate speech and incitement are on the rise. Officials frequently warn against rising temperatures, fear mongering and stirring ethnic contempt in the run-up to the polls.Expert comment: Why shutting down the Internet is counterproductiveRead: Social media shut in Uganda poll day"We don't believe it is our intention to deter people from communicating and that is why we have called you here to start alerting you on how we can ... freely communicate without having to bring a lot of tension."Officials emphasised that a shut down was not government policy and Cabinet and security agencies had not been consulted.Wangusi continued, "Sometimes, when tension is so high, the government may decide to take an action for purposes of protecting the people of Kenya from any adverse outcomes caused by those who want to cause trouble."Kenya had an estimated 37.7 million internet users in June 2016, 85.3 per cent of the population, according to the CA's latest statistics.Growth is largely driven by increased penetration of smartphones.ICT minister Joe Mucheru was quick to say, "I can tell you categorically that is not government policy. It is not our expectation the country will be in the position to shut down internet services."We are a digital country and that is not our intention. It is not even a remote fall back position."If it shut the internet,Kenya would be following in the footsteps of other African governments, which have in the past two years blocked electronic communications for political reasons during elections. Gambia, Ghana, Gabon and Uganda are the most recent and linked to elections.Other nations closing the internet for political reasons are the Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Morocco, Algeria, Burundi, Libya, Egypt, the Central African Republic, Sudan and Niger.Wangusi said the CA spent Sh400 million last year on an internet surveillance system that can monitor activities through mobile phones.Another Sh1.1 billion was spent to instal a spectrum monitoring system to monitor unauthorised communication through other channels.Politically driven Internet shutdowns have also been witnessed in India, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Brazil, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Syria and Turkey.In Kenya social media has been used to spread hate speech and fake news.Social media is fast-becoming a prominent part of everyone's life especially that of young adults. Many of them spend large amounts of time on various platforms that exposes them to disturbing content.Social media has allowed many politicians and their supporters to engage in character assassination, ethnic contempt and threats to ethnic groups. Fake accounts have been created to malign and threaten rivals and perceived enemies. A number of high-profile lawmakers and other politicians are facing cases of hate speech and inspiring ethnic contempt.According to research paper by the Brookings Institution, there were 81 short-term internet shutdowns in 19 countries between July 1, 2015, and June 30, 2016.This cost the global economy at least $2.4 billion (Sh249.16 billion).Morocco lost $320 million (Sh33.22 billion) after disrupting the internet for 182 days, while Republic of Congo lost $72 million (Sh7.45 billion) for 15 days of shut down.Neighbouring Uganda also lost $2 million (Sh207.64 million) when it disrupted the internet for five days.Kenya's economy is driven largely through mobile commerce, meaning it could lose billions if the electronic communication systems are shut down even for a day.Gituku said the CA will be monitoring the media to ensure reporting is fair and balanced during the campaign and election period.&ldquo;As the country approaches the general election in 2017, the Communications Authority of Kenya wishes to remind broadcasters of the regulatory provisions governing the responsible use of broadcasting platforms,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;We expect media operations to be above board. Media owners and journalists who have a political stand have to de-link from media house operations.&rdquo;Despite the constitutional right to freedom of expression in the constitution, the CA cites exceptions that outlaw spreading propaganda for war, inciting violence and spreading hate speech.Wangusi said the CA will set the time and the manner in which broadcasters will air political news and programmes, in accordance with the Kenya Information and Communications (Broadcasting) Regulations, 2009. These provide guidelines for the &ldquo;polling period&rdquo; that covers the period when national general elections are held, election campaigns, the post-election and referendum periods.&ldquo;It is clear from the Code that radio and television broadcasters have an obligation to serve the public interest at all times. This includes provision of equitable coverage and opportunities to registered political parties participating in an election,&rdquo; Wangusi said.Penalties for media houses that violate guidelines include revocation of broadcast licences and broadcast frequencies.&ldquo;This is not only a legal requirement but also the public responsibility of the media to uphold the democratic principles of our nation, particularly during the election period,&rdquo; Wangusi said.
