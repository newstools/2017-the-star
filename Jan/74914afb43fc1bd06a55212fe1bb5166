Congolese import Felly Mulumba&rsquo;s 52nd minute strike is all Bandari needed to hold visiting Ulinzi Stars to a 1-1 draw in an entertaining friendly match at Mbaraki Sports Club in Mombasa on Sunday.The no-nonsense defender traded from Sofapaka last year, soared in the air to nod home the equaliser after Ulinzi Stars had taken a 22nd minute lead through Enos Ochieng.The balanced encounter which attracted a fair crowd, saw Bandari start majority of their new signings among them Noah Abich ,Jacob Kelly and Michael Luvutsi all of whom gave a good account of themselves with Enock Agwanda another new signing watching from the terraces. Stand-in coaches Ken Odhiambo and George Owoko, who are holding brief for head coach Paul Nkata who is expected in Mombasa before this weekend, were in charge Bandari. Dockers had a fair chance in the first quarter of the match when striker Kelly and Apudo had their goal-bound shots blocked by the Ulinzi goalkeeper.John Makwata came close for Ulinzi but was denied by hawk-eyed Bandari keeper Wilson Obungu.After a series of missed chances, a mix up in the Bandari defence saw Ochieng&rsquo;s shot pass a forest of legs beating Obungu all the way.&ldquo;Our fitness level is still wanting, especially the new signings most of whom arrived midweek but all should be fine by the time of the league kicks off,&rdquo; Owoko said. Ulinzi coach Benjamin Nyangweso said his was work in progress as they look for a winning combination ahead of their continental assignments.
