Motorbike operators in Migori town have suspended boda boda riders until they prove that they have national IDs and voter&rsquo;s cards.The riders are registered in unions merging 42 stages in the town. They require riders to produce proof of having the two documents before they operate.Rinus Onyango, chairman of Migori Town Boda Boda Operators Association, said they took the initiative after realising that despite members being vocal in politics, they lack the dicuments.&ldquo;We sent home more than 100 riders to get the documents and register as voters,&rdquo; Onyango said yesterday. He said the number is likely to go up as most are voluntarily getting the documents. The union is also expected to target riders from outside the town.
