Nairobi county secretary Robert Ayisi (pictured) has filed an application in court, seeking to have the officer-in-charge at the KICC police station ensure his staff are not denied access to the Northern Wing at City Hall. Ayisi said assembly clerk Jacob Ngwele and speaker Alex ole Magelo have deliberately disobeyed orders issued by the court on November 18. Justice George Odunga issued an order suspending Magelo and the clerk from interfering with the Nairobi city county executive staff from accessing and performing their duties within the Northern Wing.Ayisi in his application said despite the existence of the court orders, Magelo and Ngwele have denied staff of the Nairobi city county executive access to the fourth floor. He said to preserve the dignity of the court, it is imperative that the court directs the officer-in-charge of the KICC police station enforces the orders.&ldquo;The officer-in-charge should ensure the speaker and clerk of county assembly do not deny staff from the Nairobi city county executive and the public from accessing the fourth floor of City Hall main building, Northern Wing,&rdquo; Ayisi said.He said the action disregarding the court orders cannot be taken lightly and should be dealt with at the earliest opportunity. Ayisi said Magelo and Ngwele have denied interfering with executive staff and the public from accessing the Northern Wing.Through lawyer Willis Otieno, Ayisi says Magelo and Ngwele have proceeded to erect a wall at the entrance of the fourth floor of the Northern Wing.
