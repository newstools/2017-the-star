The opposition can remove Jubilee from power if it remains united, some leaders have said.Homa Bay Governor Cyprian Awiti said the opposition knows its strength lies in the number of supporters who register as voters.Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi said, &ldquo;Jubilee has no chance in the coming elections, that is not in doubt. The only variable is its margin of loss. In any case, the twin issues of corruption and tribalism sealed Jubilee&rsquo;s fate long before NASA&rsquo;s birth.&rdquo;Homa Bay woman representative Gladys Wanga said Jubilee has panicked about losing the election. She said this is why it pushed changes to the election laws.&ldquo;The opposition&rsquo;s unity is disastrous to Jubilee. It is in the public domain that if the August elections are conducted transparently, NASA will beat Jubilee hands down,&rdquo; she said.ODM national chairman John Mbadi said the opposition has a big chance of winning because of its numbers. He said opposition leaders are pushing their supporters to register as voters in large numbers.&ldquo;Our projection shows that the opposition is winning this coming election as early as noon if our supporters register in large numbers,&rdquo; Mbadi said.Kitutu Chache South MP Timothy Bosire said Jubilee should not be reelected because it has miserably failed to curb corruption. He said President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s administration has even failed to take legal action against individuals who have embezzled public funds.
