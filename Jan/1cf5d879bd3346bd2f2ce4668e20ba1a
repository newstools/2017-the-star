Water CS Eugene Wamalwa has been urged to stick to his original plan of running for Nairobi governor instead of Trans Nzoia. &ldquo;He is causing confusion.The plans we had put in place to have Jubilee win the seat will now be scattered,&rdquo; Matumbei MCA Philip Sakong said. Eugene last week said he is considering running against the incumbent Patrick Khaemba.He said he will announce his plans next month. But Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa said Eugene has rendered himself irrelevant in local politics &ldquo;for lack of principles&rdquo;.&ldquo;It will not be possible for him to joke around with voters and change his stand now and then think that people will just follow him,&rdquo; he said. Eugene and the MP are likely to run on the JP ticket. Others eyeing the ticket include businessman Kakai Bisau, former minister Noah Wekesa and former journalist Joshua Sang.
