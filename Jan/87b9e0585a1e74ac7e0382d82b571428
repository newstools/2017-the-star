Changamwe MP Omar Mwinyi (pictured) has failed his constituents, Wiper aspirant Peterson Mitau said on Sunday.He said Mwinyi Changamwe residents are suffering because of failed leadership. Mitau spoke when he gave bursaries to 14 students. &ldquo;This is evidence that the MP has failed. Some bright needy students have failed to join secondary school because of being neglected by Mwinyi. We are telling him to start packing,&rdquo; he said.Mitau said the MP has been engaging in political games, instead of helping residents. &ldquo;This is the first batch of my bursary support to my people. I will continue helping them once I get into Parliament,&rdquo; he said.This is the third time Mitau is running the seat. He lost in 2007 and 2013. Mitau has expressed confidence he will wrest the seat from Mwinyi. Mwinyi won on the ODM ticket and is an ally of Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho. He faces stiff competition from more than eight contenders.Abdi Daib, a Jubilee candidate, is one of the individuals with massive support on the ground, especially from the Somali community. Mitau, a Kamba, is capitalising on the Kambas in the constituency. They are the majority ethnic bloc and are believed to be the ones who helped Mwinyi clinch the seat in 2013.Joho is also said to be courting the Kamba community to enable him retain his seat. Businessman Suleiman Shahbal, who is in the running for governor on the Jubilee ticket, got many votes from the Kambas in 2013, when he ran on the Wiper ticket.
