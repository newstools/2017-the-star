Luhya leaders have been urged to be proactive in getting residents to list as voters.Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli told the leaders to ensure residents collect their IDs.&ldquo;What I want from the voters is to ensure they put their votes in one basket and ensure they take you to the leadership positions. So, ensure there are enough votes among your supporters to give you power,&rdquo; he said.Atwoli spoke on Wednesday during the burial of his uncle Elphas Malala in Ebuchero village, Khwisero constituency.Present were Vihiga MCAs Ben Ombima (nominated), Geoffrey Ommatera (Kisa Central), Joel Ongoro (Kisa East), Swaka Limera (Kisa North) and Ben Omboko (Kisa West).&ldquo;Ensure everyone with an ID card has a voter&rsquo;s card. We want to have the numbers to be able to bargain and earn respect from people who have despised us for a long time,&rdquo; Atwoli said.He urged MCAs to map out their wards and lead door-to-door campaigns to register residents. Atwoli also urged MPs, senators and governors to participate in the campaigns. He praised Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula for agreeing to work with ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi. Mudavadi was appointed the Luhya spokesman on December 31.&ldquo;Their coming together is a sign this community is headed in the right direction. We want to move together and ensure all our votes are cast in one basket,&rdquo; Atwoli said. He expressed confidence Mudavadi would increase the region&rsquo;s influence.&ldquo;We are only known to have occupied the vice presidency. But under Mudavadi, we are moving to occupy State House,&rdquo; Atwoli said. &ldquo;Let the whole region follow Mudavadi, Wetang&rsquo;ula, [Kakamega Governor Wycliffe] Oparanya, [Cyrus] Jirongo and [Kakamega] Senator Boni Khalwale.&rdquo;
