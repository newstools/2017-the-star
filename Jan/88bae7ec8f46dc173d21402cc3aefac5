Kiambu health volunteers may soon receive a monthly stipend if the county assembly passes the Community Health Strategy Bill.Governor William Kabogo yesterday said the volunteers provide primary healthcare and educate residents at the grassroots. He spoke in Kiambu town when he met the more than 3,000 community health workers.&ldquo;These noble men and women, who offer their time and money for the service and welfare of the community, have not gone unnoticed,&rdquo; Kabogo said. &ldquo;They will now be known as community health workers and in turn receive allowances from my government.&rdquo; He said the monthly stipend will bolster their morale. &ldquo;Everything must be done according to law. We have handed the Bill to the assembly for scrutiny and legalisation so that the health volunteers may be factored in the county&rsquo;s budget,&rdquo; Kabogo said.Health executive Jonah Mwangi said the law will institutionalise the work of the workers and ensure the county government recognises their role in providing healthcare. &ldquo;The concept will improve healthcare, especially maternal services. The county government is willing to commit reasonable resources to the community health units,&rdquo; he said.Health worker Tabitha Wanjiru said the allowance will make their work. &ldquo;We walk long distances and spend a lot of money on airtime,&rdquo; she said.Kabogo urged striking doctors to resume duty as talks on their demands continue.
