Led by James Karanja, parents said the school management didn&rsquo;t involve them when determining the fees.&ldquo;We want the board disbanded and the head teacher and his deputy transferred. What would it cost them to call a meeting? We do not ask for sitting allowances,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;The two control the board and parents&rsquo; association. We will not allow ourselves to be used.&rdquo; The parents said their children cultivate school farms, which teachers have subdivided among themselves.&ldquo;Our children carry jembes, pangas and water. We realised they cultivate their teachers&rsquo; farms in school. This is unacceptable,&rdquo; a parent said.
