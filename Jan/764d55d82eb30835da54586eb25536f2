Lagdera MP Mohamed Shidiye has urged the government to scale up the livestock offtake programme to remote areas of the constituency. Speaking to the press in Modogashe town after touring drought-stricken areas, he said pastoralists in the rural remote areas are most affected.Shidiye saidweak and emaciated animals in far flung areas cannot be brought to markets in urban centres because they may die on their way.&ldquo;How do you tell herders more than 100km from the market to bring their already weak animals to the market without providing transport? let the Kenya Meat Commission, which is leading the programme, use the chiefs and assistant chiefs to identify where the herders are and go for them,&rdquo; he said.Shidiye said even though President Uhuru Kenyatta meant well for pastoralists by launching the offtake exercise, there are chances it might not help the intended persons if the programme is not well-coordinated.He said water pans, shallow wells and dams are fast drying up, while pasture is hard to come by, signaling a bleak future for the pastoralists. &ldquo;To date, some pastoralists have lost more than 80 per cent of their livelihood, rendering them destitute. There is need for those concerned to take the programme seriously," Shidiye said.Speaking at the Garissa livestock market last week when he officially launched the exercise, KMC official Hassan Jelle said the government has set aside Sh170 million for the first phase of the programme.
