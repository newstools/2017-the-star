National Land Commission chairperson Muhammad Swazuri has been issued with a notice of contempt for commenting on a parcel of land in Westlands, whose ownership is contested in court. Through Michael Osundwa, Frank Logistics Ltd, owned by city businessman Francis Njeru, filed the contempt suit on Thursday last week. They accuse Swazuri of commenting on a case pending before Justice George Odunga. Osundwa said on January 25, Swazuri was quoted saying Njeru, who police linked to the demolition of a Sh55 million house in Westlands, does not have any legitimate ownership documents for the land. He said the land, therefore, belonged to Parin Kurji&rsquo;s family. Swazuri said the commission was preparing a lease in favour of Kurji. The company was allowed by Justice Odunga to serve Swazuri through an advertisement in the dailies.
