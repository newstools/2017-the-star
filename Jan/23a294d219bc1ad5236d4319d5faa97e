A section of Marakwet youth have lashed out at the Baringo MCAsw who termed the DP a dictatorial meddler.At a press conference on Friday, the ward representatives accused DP William Ruto of dictatorship and micromanaging ground politics in Rift Valley.They further accused him of handpicking Betting, Controls and Licensing Board Director Simon Kiprono Chelugui to vie for Baringo Senator to oppose incumbent Gideon Moi.More on this: Ruto dictatorial, meddling in Rift Valley politics, Baringo Kanu MCAs sayBut youths, led by Kerio Valley Youth Association chairman Joel Kimaiyo, said Chelugui's candidature was settled upon during a meeting at Ruto's Sugoi home on December 27, 2016.He told the Star on Sunday that the bid was initiated by Baringo elders, alongside that of former Inspector General of Police David Kimaiyo.The chairman added that Ruto was too busy with national issues to deal with such matters."The record should be set straight that it was not the DP who asked Chelugui to do so," he said."It is utter nonsense and false for someone to claim that Ruto promised to fund Chelugui to face off with Gideon [Kanu chairman]."Kimaiyo added that Gideon was "not at all a threat to Ruto's quest for the top seat come 2022".His group said it was now clear that the Senator was working with the opposition to undermine Jubilee's leadership, contrary to the perception that he was supportive of President Uhuru Kenyatta's re-election on August 8.The Deputy President has come under fire from a section of Baringo leaders who have accused him of interfering with the region's politics.Last Friday, Kanu MCA aspirant Erick Bett faulted Ruto for giving them a line-up of leaders to vote for in the election.&ldquo;We are shocked by Chelugui&rsquo;s move to join the senatorial race after visiting Ruto&rsquo;s Sugoi home. We are told he was asked to direct his energies towards fighting Gideon,&rdquo; Bett said.Read: Betting control boss ditches Baringo governor race for bid to unseat Gideon MoiAlso read: I am not Ruto's wife to be forced into Jubilee Party - Gideon Moi
