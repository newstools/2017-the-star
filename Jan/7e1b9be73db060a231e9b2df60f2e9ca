The government is closing in on drug barons and illegal gun holders, some of whom are politicians, spokesperson Eric Kiraithe said yesterday.He declined, however, to name the politicians he alluded to. Kiraithe said those who will be arrested should not &ldquo;feign to be political victims&rdquo;. &ldquo;If you are arrested in connection with drugs and charged, kindly spare the Kenyans the political war rhetoric. What you can do for yourself and for every other Kenya in present and future is stop it [drug business], tonight,&rdquo; Kiraithe (pictured) said. &ldquo;There are very many legitimate businesses you can carry out.&rdquo;He said those on police radar will be arrested and prosecuted, regardless of their positions in society. &ldquo;We do not have a shortage of politicians, whether in opposition or in the government. You will be replaced faster than you can imagine,&rdquo; Kiraithe said in Mombasa.He said there are many aspiring politicians, who can replace any one arrested in connection with the illicit business.&ldquo;Somebody can walk around thinking they are [invincible]. But when we arrest you and take you to court, there will be no political vacuum,&rdquo; Kiraithe said.He said some politicians form gangs around them, not for personal security, but to intimidate opponents and show arrogant display of power.
