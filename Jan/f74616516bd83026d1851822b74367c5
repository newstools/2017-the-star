Telkom Kenya has appointed two experienced telecommunications executives to its top management team. This is part of its ongoing transformational agenda following a takeover by UK private equity firm Helios principal partners from France Telecom last June. The country&rsquo;s third-largest mobile network operator yesterday named James Kamau head of supply chain, while Levi Nyakundi is the new chief marketing officer. Both have more than 15 years experience in the sector. Kamau has more than 15 years experience in telecommunications, oil and gas and fast-moving consumer goods sectors in Kenya and Nigeria. Nyakundi has been the marketing director for Airtel Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda for the last six years. He has also worked in various capacities at Unilever Kenya and Uganda for six years. Telkom, which trades as Orange, in November appointed former Safaricom&rsquo;s head of finance and planning Sundararaman Pattabiraman its chief financial officer.
