Governors on Tuesday dismissed claims by the National Treasury that counties have failed to utilise funds allocated them.Wycliffe Oparanya, Council of Governors finance committee chairman, said the National Treasury was reluctant to address challenges of the IFMIS system.He said the glitches have compromised the security of taxpayers' funds."This is the real problem that needs to be addressed in order to streamline the flow of funds to county governments," Oparanya said.He said it was ironic that the statement showing CBK cash balances for all the 47 counties as at January 18 this year came immediately after the national Treasury disbursed the November 2016 funds to counties."This is clearly a case of late disbursement and not low budget absorption capacity by county governments," the Kakamega governor said.He added that salaries and payments to suppliers were delayed in December 2016 as a result of late disbursement and failure of the IFMIS system between December 2016 and January 5.Read: IFMIS system breaks down, governors warn of looming cash crisisAlso read: Treasury insists IFMIS is helping fight corruption "It is therefore malicious and with bad intent for the National Treasury to allege counties have failed to absorb their allocations," Oparanya said."I would like to correct the impression created through recent publications in the local dailies by the National Treasury on the status of Fiscal Transfers that county governments have failed to meet their obligations," he said.He said counties have in the past engaged the National Treasury on serious constraints they face arising out of the malfunctioning of the IFMS system.Oparanya said the engagement included means to deal with irregular and delayed disbursements as well.
