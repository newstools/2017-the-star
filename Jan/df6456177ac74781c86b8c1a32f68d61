The IEBC has set up a centre at the office of the registrar of persons in Malindi to assist residents who go to collect their ID cards to register as voters on the spot. There are thousands of uncollected IDs lying in the office.The IEBC hopes this will help it reach its target of 20,000 new voters in the ongoing mass registration. Journalists yesterday visited the offices and found more than 1,000 uncollected IDs.The IEBC official had registered 10 voters and 71 IDs had been collected by the time reporters got there. Officer in charge David Gitau said they had 6,000 uncollected IDs before last year&rsquo;s March 7 by-election. &ldquo;We came up with an outreach programme to take the IDs to chiefs so people could easily collect them,&rdquo; he said.
