There are reports that the woman has been promising various aspirants that she will make sure they clinch the tickets in the party&rsquo;s primaries expected in February. A group of aspirants confronted her at Orange House on Saturday, demanding to know why she was expressing open favouritism to some aspirants, despite the party leadership having promised free, fair and credible primaries. The culture of dishing out nomination certificates has previously been seen as ODM and Jubilee&rsquo;s biggest threat in consolidating grassroots support in the run-up to a general election. Those in the know tell Corridors that ODM leader Raila Odinga has been alerted of the con game playing out at his party headquarters and is expected to crack the whip soon to restore confidence in the integrity of the forthcoming primaries expected to be hotly contested. Credible nominations are regarded as key in building Raila&rsquo;s presidential campaign momentum.**************The organisers of Deputy President William Ruto's massive parties at his Sugoi home had planned to ensure all Western MPs shun the event organized at Bukhungu Stadium by Cotu SG Francis Atwoli to appoint a Luhya spokesperson.

Whereas Atwoli remains among Ruto&rsquo;s top critics, the organisers believed Atwoli&rsquo;s rally would have a low profile if all MPs snubbed the event. However, they managed to convince seven MPs to take part in the Ruto event while the majority remained at Atwoli&rsquo;s event. A few skipped both events for unknown reasons.
