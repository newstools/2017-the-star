The Jubilee administration is proud of what it has achieved, President Uhuru Kenyatta said in his New Year message to the nation.The President said though Kenyans are still facing challenges, he is proud of the work Jubilee has done and is hoping to be reelected."In August, I know it will be clear to most Kenyans that we have managed to do more than any previous administration, and more than most other countries with a comparable profile," Uhuru said.He highlighted the extension of electricity connections countrywide, saying that millions of Kenyans have stopped relying on kerosene and security has improved due to street lights."Millions of children are doing their homework at night under bright lights, when a few years ago their families slept early to save the kerosene in their lamps," Uhuru said.He added that in the past year, millions of Kenyans who would have suffered from malaria did not as the government increased the supply of mosquito nets."We have improved public hospitals and put in place medical equipment that Kenyans would in the past have needed to travel to Nairobi at great expense to access. We still have a long way to go to make this a healthy nation, but we are moving quickly in the right direction," Uhuru said.He added that the government's efforts are making headway compared to the rest of the world. The head of state highlighted the first Global Youth Development Index that noted that Kenya has made the greatest strides in improving the conditions of young people in the past five years. "The score for Africa was low compared to the rest of the world, but our continent is gaining ground the fastest and Kenya is leading the continent," Uhuru said."Change does not come overnight, especially when we are digging ourselves out of the immense poverty, ignorance and conflict that came from almost a century of colonial oppression and centuries of the damaging legacy of slavery."The President also said that like many Kenyans, he was impatient to do more to be able to tie the multiple projects and initiatives the government has undertaken into a powerful engine of investment and industrialisation. "So that at the end of the next term, which I will ask Kenyans to grant me, we will have an economy that is truly a lion in terms of the goods and services it produces. Young Kenyans will have many more opportunities and jobs as we continue to work to achieve this," Uhuru said.
