State House yesterday denied the withdrawal of governors Hassan Joho&rsquo;s and Amason Kingi&rsquo;s security details was political.Spokesman Manoah Esipisu said the move was part of the reorganisation of the regional command structure.He asked the two governors to seek answers to their questions from the regional command. &ldquo;My understanding is that regional command structures in Mombasa and Kilifi are reorganising themselves and I think it would be up to them to respond to any issues,&rdquo; Esipisu said at State House, Mombasa.Questioned whether the reorganisation was unique to Mombasa and Kilifi, the spokesman said reorganisations happen all the time across the country and are normal operational routines.&ldquo;Local commands make local decisions. We must not always jump to the fact that this or that must have happened to make that happen,&rdquo; Esipisu said.
