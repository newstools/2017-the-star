Sacked Nyamira assembly minority leader Jackson Mogusu has said he will remain in office, despite being voted out by Jubilee MCAs during a meeting held on Tuesday.&ldquo;First of all, I have heard it from your fellow journalists. They did not follow procedure in purporting to remove me from office. I was not even invited to the meeting to defend myself,&rdquo; he said on Tuesday.Mogusu said his sacking was unprocedural. He was replaced by Rigoma MCA Benson Sironga. Last week, the Budget and Appropriations Committee was dissolved by speaker Joash Nyamoko. The speaker accused committee chairman James Sabwengi of undermining him. Mogusu was a member of the panel.Nyamoko also accused the panel members of performing dismally since they took office in 2013.Minority whip Nyameino Atuti said Mogusu was sacked because &ldquo;he frustrated Jubilee&rsquo;s agenda in the assembly.&rdquo;Mogusu was among the MCAs who had opposed formation of a committee to investigate the use of funds for projects.However, other minority MCAs pushed for the formation of the committee and the proposal was adopted.The committee was given two weeks to table its report.Contacted, Nyamoko said he has not officially been notified about Mogusu&rsquo;s sacking.&ldquo;Standing Orders require that the party chief whip present a formal record of minutes and resolutions on the removal of the official. I have not received any official communication. When I do, I will follow the House Standing Orders,&rdquo; he said.Mogusu was elected on the TNA ticket. He said all minority MCAs were elected on parties that have been dissolved so he will remain the minority leader until his term expires.&ldquo;There is a lot of confusion in the assembly, but sanity will prevail in the next two weeks. It is just a matter of time,&rdquo; he said.Mogusu said it was illegal for Nyamoko to dissolve the budget committee.
