Newly crowned national Division One women&rsquo;s champions Zetech University will recruit a post player to beef up their team ahead on this year&rsquo;s Premier League action.Zetech tactician Maurice Obilo said they have already secured the services of a play-maker and all they are searching for at the moment is for a top centre.&ldquo;With the acquisition of a guard now complete, what I need now is a post player and the team will be ready to take on anyone in the Premier League,&rdquo; said Obilo, who guided the team to the feat on their debut without losing a game.He attributed their success to strong foundation at the provincial level and good management.&ldquo;It is the NBA that helped shape this team to what it is today. The league was superbly organised and the congestion of fixtures generally hardened us,&rdquo; noted Obilo.Zetech blanked Strathmore University 3-0 in the best of five games series to claim the crown without losing a single game throughout the season. They won the first two matches 41-36 and 55-46 and went on to wrap Game Three 45-35.
