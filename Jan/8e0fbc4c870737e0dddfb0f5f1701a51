Nairobi governor aspirants should stop trying to intimidate former presidential candidate Peter Kenneth in his bid to run for governor in the city, Murang&rsquo;a county leaders have said.&ldquo;Nairobi belongs to all of us as it the capital city of Kenya. So anyone can vie and the voters will decide who they want to govern them,&rdquo; Kigumo MP Jamleck Kamau said on the phone yesterday.The legislator, who wants to run for Murang&rsquo;a governor, said a candidate&rsquo;s competency, skills and ability to deliver is what should matter.Referring to Kenneth as an outsider is political backwardness, he said.On Sunday, Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko said &ldquo;foreigners&rdquo; are not welcome to contest.Kiharu MP Irungu Kang&rsquo;ata said Nairobi is a metropolitan city and anyone can run for election.&ldquo;It is very sad to see leaders we presume to have matured politically fighting our son because he has declared interest in a seat. He has the right to vie. They should research and they will be shocked by how much interest Murang&rsquo;a people have in the city,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;The leaders who are actually fighting Kenneth are just scared because they know they have no impact with Nairobi voters who have direct and indirect links with Murang&rsquo;a. They have no choice but to work with Kenneth.&rdquo;Kandara MP Alice Wahome said fighting Kenneth will spell doom for the Nairobi leaders as he is a known performer from his days as Gatanga MP and assistant minister.Sonko, nominated MP Johnson Sakaja and Dagoretti legislator Denis Waweru have launched a scathing attack against Kenneth after he publicly announced he will run for Nairobi governor. The three also want to run for the same position on the JP ticket.While declaring his bid, Kenneth was with nominated Senator Beatrice Elachi and Nairobi woman representative Rachel Shebesh and Embakasi North MP James Gakuya.Others were MPs George Theuri (Embakasi West), Waihenya Ndirangu (Roysambu), Yusuf Hassan (Kamukunji), John Njoroge (Kasarani) and John Omondi (Embakasi East) and several MCAs.
