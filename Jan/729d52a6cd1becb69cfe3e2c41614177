They include 262 MCAs, 92 MPs, nine governors, eight senators and 14 woman representatives.

The emergence of the new political parties will not scare us,&rdquo; he said.Mbadi said ODM will conduct transparent, free and fair nominations and anybody who thinks otherwise will be in for a &ldquo;rude shock&rdquo;.During the March 4, 2013, general election, ODM lost seats due to flawed nominations.
