A united Western Kenya is enough to send President Uhuru Kenyatta home in the August election, opposition leaders Musalia Mudavadi and Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula have said.On Monday, the two held a two-hour meeting in Nairobi&rsquo;s Karen and promised to ensure the region votes as a bloc against Uhuru&rsquo;s Jubilee administration.&ldquo;Musalia briefed him on his recent Bungoma visit, and Wetang&rsquo;ula also did the same on his campaign programmes. Both agreed to harmonise their plans which will be shared with the public in two weeks,&rdquo; a source said yesterday.The meeting comes after Wetang&rsquo;ula was recently quoted saying he only recognises Cord, not the National Super Alliance &mdash; an umbrella opposition vehicle fronted by Mudavadi.The remarks attributed to Wetang&rsquo;ula heightened confusion and fear in the opposition that the support base of the two is likely to pull in different directions and give Uhuru an easy victory.&ldquo;They will have a first rally in Vihiga this Thursday. They will then move from county to county in Western to cement their relationship and ensure everyone registers in the ongoing voter listing,&rdquo; the aide said.Mudavadi&rsquo;s ANC and Wetang&rsquo;ula&rsquo;s Ford Kenya are part of the opposition aiming to remove Uhuru&rsquo;s Jubilee regime from power, alongside Raila Odinga&rsquo;s ODM and Kalonzo Musyoka&rsquo;s Wiper.Whereas ODM, Wiper and Ford Kenya are members of Raila&rsquo;s Cord that ran against Uhuru in the 2013 elections, Mudavadi is pushing for the creation of NASA that brings together all the opposition parties.The Star has established that after the Western tour, they will both join other Cord leaders for countrywide campaigns.Yesterday, ANC MPs Alfred Agoi (Sabatia) and Ayub Savula (Lugari) said the unity of the opposition leaders &ldquo;is the only hope the people of Western and the entire country have.&rdquo; Agoi said, &ldquo;This is our moment. We want to tell those who have spoken ill of the opposition unity that indeed, the time has come for the downtrodden to speak in one voice.&rdquo;Savula said, &ldquo;We realised we cannot go to the next elections divided as a community and [expect to] form a government.&rdquo;
