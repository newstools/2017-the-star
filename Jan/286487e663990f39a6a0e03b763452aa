Presidential hopeful Philip Murgor has asked Kenyans to hold President Uhuru accountable for the crises Kenya is facing due to bad governance.The aspirant asked the President to focus on issues affecting Kenyans such as deaths in hospitals, insecurity and drought, instead of voter registration."Kenyans are not getting value for the taxes they pay owing to corruption and tribalism being perpetrated concurrently in the country. Stealing is now more of a priority than serving the people," said the former DPP.Murgor cited the long doctors strike that he said has seen hospitals closed and cartels take over the sector.He noted the government has been unable to pay doctors, launch new projects and improve infrastructure because it does not have any money."It is bad for a government to walk out of a five-year leadership position without a single project that was not initiated and funded through kickbacks," he said.Read: Kenyans opposed to doctors&rsquo; strike &mdash; IpsosMurgor said top leaders in Uhuru's Jubilee Party were behind the graft and tribal division the country has faced.He further said on Monday that corruption and tribalism are linked to the socio-economic and political crises in the country. The aspirant also noted that Kenya was ranked one of the most corrupt countries in East Africa and said there is no good political will to stop white-collar criminals from stealing public funds.Murgor went on to say that the national debt was growing rapidly to finance individuals pockets. He said the country was being controlled by cartels exploiting all opportunities available to loot public funds."Cartels are holding the country at ransom and the presidency is not ready to stop them. They don't care about other citizens, but their stealing spree," said the United Democratic Movement (UDM) leader.He spoke after meeting UDM aspirants at the party headquarters in Nairobi.

There has been debate on whether the Kenya Defence Forces should pull ouf of Somalia where they are serving as part of Amisom.But Uhuru has been categorical about their stay, despite accusation of illegal charcoal and sugar trade, saying Kenya and Somalia must be secured.Following an ambush in Kulbiyow last Friday, a soldier claimed the military received intelligence but that bosses did not make use of it.The al Qaeda-linked terror group said its fighters killed at least 66 people when they overran the camp near the Kenyan border.Just as was the case when al Shabaab attacked a camp in El Adde on January 15 last year, the government has not given details.Murgor said: "The same government is instructing families of slain KDF soldiers not to talk about their sons and daughters killed in Somali because the public will know the high numbers of those killed int he attack."More on this: KDF received intel on Kulbiyow attack but bosses sat pretty - soldierAlso read: Kenyans say fresh al Shabaab ambush similar to El Adde, question state
