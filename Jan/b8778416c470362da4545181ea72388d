Deputy President William Ruto has suspended most of his meetings with his close allies and aspirants in the Rift Valley to avoid the impression that he has preferred candidates in Jubilee nominations.The DP will only engage in official meetings with elected leaders from the region following pressure from key politicians that he should not take sides ahead of the hotly contested primaries.Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter and former Cabinet minister Nicholas Biwott are among those who have publicly asked Ruto to let all aspirants in the region to campaign on their own.&ldquo;We are asking you not to take sides at all. Let us compete on an equal ground. You should only come in to support those who will win in the nominations,&rdquo; Keter told Ruto at a recent meeting in Eldoret.One of Ruto&rsquo;s aides confirmed to the Star that the DP had instructed them to restrict meetings with aspirants unless the meetings are for community groups, and not aimed at discussing Jubilee nominations.&ldquo;We have also been told not to attend meetings hosted by aspirants and that we should restrict ourselves to official functions only,&rdquo; the aide, who declined to be named, said.Last week, during the burial of former nominated MP Mark Too, Biwott told Ruto to concentrate on national politics and avoid engaging in regional politics in the counties.&ldquo;You are up there and we don't want you to engage in small kind politics that involve governors, MCAs and the rest. Leave that to us as you deal with other government and Jubilee matters,&rdquo; Biwott said.Ruto said President Uhuru Kenyatta, himself and the Jubilee Party by extension will not have any preferred candidates ahead of the nominations, and that all aspirants should fight on their own. &ldquo;We want credible, free and fair nominations and that will apply in all regions,&rdquo; the DP said.The move by the DP has thrown some of his close allies into confusion as they have been trying to reach him in vain. Most of them have gone back to the drawing board to scheme for their survival especially after formidable aspirants emerged ahead of the nominations.The fight for the jubilee tickets is expected to be more tight in Ruto&rsquo;s home county of Uasin Gishu, Nandi, Elgeyo Marakwet and Baringo among other areas considered to be jubilee strong holds.
