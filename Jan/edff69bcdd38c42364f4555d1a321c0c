The credibility of the anti-corruption agency file recommending the prosecution of Auditor General Edward Ouko is in question following claims the list was doctored to drop certain names.The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission recommended on December 16 last year that Ouko and some of his officers be charged over irregular procurement of an audit vault software at Sh100 million against the estimated cost of Sh18 million.The Star has established that the name of Deputy Auditor General John Kagondu, who was the secretary of the executive committee that oversaw the procurement of the software, was removed from the file sent to the DPP.The document sent to the DPP shows that Kagondu was in the committee alongside Ouko, Stephen Kinuthia, Agnes Mita and Alex Rugera. However, his witness account is missing, despite EACC investigators having interrogated him.EACC deputy chief executive Michael Mubea refuted the editing claims, but did not explain whether the commission was aware and why the name was missing. &ldquo;Our findings and recommendations are based on facts and the law,&rdquo; Mubea told the Star yesterday.Direct procurementAccording to the EACC file, the committee met in June 2013 where the audit vault was discussed and later approved the single sourcing of the Oracle Audit Software &amp; Tools.It was further alleged that the software was purchased through direct procurement and that the supplier was paid without adequate documentation. According to inside information at the national audit office, Kagondu, whose contract expires next month, is being groomed to succeed Ouko.&ldquo;There is a rush to charge the auditor general so that the guy takes over in acting capacity pending his confirmation. This explains why his name is missing from the file,&rdquo; the source said.Those pushing the removal of Ouko are believed to be uncomfortable about his audit revelations on a number of state agencies, among them the electoral commission that largely forced the commissioners out over procurement irregularities in the 2013 elections and beyond.It is also reported that the need to charge Ouko is the reason the file was rushed to the DPP before Eliud Wabukala takes over as chairman, a claim that Mubea did not respond to.Documents seen by the Star indicate the file is inconsistent as some statements are missing.It is also said the rush to charge Ouko is informed by the fear of the expected revelations on the Eurobond investigations and and those on government&rsquo;s confidential expenditures.
