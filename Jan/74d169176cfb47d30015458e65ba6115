Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero on Friday fired his financial and economic advisor over involvement in politics.He told the Star that Martin Ogindo was in "gross violation of his contract ... by involving himself in politics as opposed to professionally advising the county."Kidero directed county secretary Robert Ayisi to terminate Martin Ogindo&rsquo;s contract for &ldquo;gross violation of terms of contract and conflict of interest"."You will be paid one month's salary in lieu of one month's notice and your gratuity pay for the time worked at 31 per cent," the letter says.Ogindo was Rangwe MP between 2008 and 2013. His sacking came just a day after he launched his political party, the Green Congress of Kenya.Sources say he intends to contest for the MP post in this year's general elections.While he did not respond to calls, Ogindo wrote to Kidero thanking him "for the opportunity to serve" in the county government."I want to wish everyone well as I take full responsibility for my actions," he said.
