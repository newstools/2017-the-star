Sirisia MP hopeful Moses Nandalwe has warned Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula against ignoring the Bukhungu Declaration that installed Amani leader Musalia Mudavadi the official Luhya spokesperson. He said Wetang&rsquo;ula risks ending his political career if he continues his opposition. Nandalwe, who attended the Bukhungu stadium rally, said they will ensure the Luhya community listens to Mudavadi. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s in the public domain that even if Atwoli couldn&rsquo;t have used research, Mudavadi is the most popular presidential candidate in Western Kenya, going by the number of MCAs, MPs, senators and governors [who support him], &ldquo; he said. Nandalwe said Atwoli has made history because since the demise of Wamalwa Kijana and Muliro Masinde, the community has lacked a selfless leader who can use his own resources to unite it. &ldquo;Those making noises that they were not consulted are lying. Atwoli called them to the table,&rdquo; he said.
