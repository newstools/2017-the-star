Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko has accused Starehe MP Maina Kamanda of threatening JP aspirants who are opposed to Peter Kenneth&rsquo;s bid for city governor.&ldquo;Mzee Kamanda ... is saying that if you do not join the camp supporting Kenneth&rsquo;s governor bid, then you will not get the Jubilee ticket,&rdquo; he said.Sonko spoke during JP&rsquo;s &lsquo;Team Nairobi&rsquo; voter registration mobilisation rally in Kangemi last week. He was with Dagoretti South MP Dennis Waweru, former Starehe MP Margaret Wanjiru and nominated MP Johnson Sakaja.The four want to run for Nairobi governor and are opposed to Kenneth, terming him a &ldquo;project and an outsider&rdquo;. Kamanda did not answer calls. Sonko asked Kenneth to join Team Nairobi and fight for the party ticket in free and fair primaries instead of waiting to be hand-picked.Kenneth, a former presidential candidate, is being seen by political pundits as the strongest candidate to unseat incumbent Evans Kidero (ODM).
