Kenya's coral reefs is among those set to be affected by coral bleaching which poses grave threat to one of the earth&rsquo;s most important ecosystems.According to a research recently published in the journal Nature Scientific Reports, there will be severe bleaching every year on 99 per cent of the world&rsquo;s reefs within the century."If current trends continue and the world fails to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, then severe bleaching will occur every year on 99 per cent of the world&rsquo;s reefs within the century," the report says.The high-resolution projections, based on global climate models, predict when and where annual coral bleaching will occur. According to the projections, reefs in Taiwan and around the Turks and Caicos archipelago will be among the world&rsquo;s first to experience annual bleaching. Reefs within Kenyan coast are also expected to be distabilised by the events occasioned by climate change.UN headof Environment Erik Solheim said: "The predictions are a treasure trove for those who are fighting to protect one of the world&rsquo;s most magnificent and important ecosystems from the ravages of climate change," Solheim said the predictions allow conservationists and governments to prioritize the protection of reefs that may still have time to acclimatize to our warming seas."The projections show us where we still have time to act before it&rsquo;s too late," he said. The report comes a day after Kenya ratified the Paris Agreement.The agreement targets to limit global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius provides a safer, but not an entirely safe space for coral reefs.The report says that even if emission reductions exceed pledges made by countries to date under the Paris Agreement more than three quarters of the world&rsquo;s coral reefs will bleach every year before 2070.More on this: Reef protection, cooler boxes help Lamu fishing industryRead: Kenya's popular fish may soon be gone, experts warnBleaching of coral reefs capacity of coral reefs to provide goods and services, such as fisheries and coastal protection, to human communities.It takes at least 5 years for a reef to recover from a single bleaching event.The report says that the world witnessed the longest global bleaching event ever recorded, which killed coral on an unprecedented scale between 2014 and 2016."In 2016, bleaching hit 90 per cent of coral on the Great Barrier Reef and killed more than 20 per cent of the reef&rsquo;s coral," the study says. The new study shows that, on average, the world's reefs will start suffering annual bleaching in 2043. About 5 per cent of them will be hit a decade or more earlier, while about 11 per cent will suffer annual bleaching a decade or more later than this date.Coral reefs, which are already under threat from overfishing and tourism, are especially vulnerable to climate change because they are easily affected by warm water. When sea temperatures rise, the algae that give coral its bright colours leave their host, causing it to look white, hence the term &lsquo;coral bleaching&rsquo;. The loss of algae, which provide coral with much of its energy, make corals vulnerable to starvation and disease.
