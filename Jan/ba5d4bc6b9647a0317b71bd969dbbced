The National Treasury raised less than a quarter of the Sh12 billion it offered in six-month and one-year debt securities this week ahead of Sh197.5 billion repayments in February and March.The Central Bank, the Treasury&rsquo;s fiscal agent, in a statement said it accepted bids worth Sh2.88 billion during Wednesday&rsquo;s auction of 182- and 364-day Treasury Bills. T-bills are short-term instruments the government uses to raise cash to offset deficit in the budget.Bids worth Sh1.54 billion out of Sh5.62 billion received during the sale of 182-day T-bills were accepted. This represents 25.67 per cent of the Sh6 billion on offer under the debt facility which matures after six months, as return-chasing investors held onto their cash awaiting higher yields.Average interest on the 182-day T-bill remained steady, dropping slightly to 10.46 per cent from 10.47 per cent a week earlier.The CBK accepted bids worth Sh1.33 billion on one-year paper which attracted bids worth Sh2.92 billion, a 48.66 per cent subscription of the Sh6 billion on offer. This was lower than Sh3.85 billion or 64.16 per cent subscription last week.&ldquo;The total number of bids received was 223 amounting to Sh5.62 billion representing 93.68 per cent subscription and 100 bids amounting to Sh2.92 billion, representing 48.66 per cent subscription for 182 and 364 days, respectively,&rdquo; the CBK said in its weekly release on T-bills sale.Analysts at upstart Cytonn Investments expect public borrowing to rise above the monthly Sh89.6 billion target in February and March to offset Sh106 billion and Sh91.5 billion maturities in the respective months.&ldquo;The expected significant maturities, coupled with the expected increase in the domestic borrowing target from the tax deficit and the foreign borrowings delays, could result in an upward pressure on interest rates,&rdquo; Cytonn said in its annual outlook report this week. &ldquo;However, we expect this to be mitigated by the improved liquidity position in the money market.&rdquo;Since the beginning of the fiscal year in July, the Treasury has borrowed Sh169.2 billion against a revised target of Sh158.6 billion, Cytonn says.
