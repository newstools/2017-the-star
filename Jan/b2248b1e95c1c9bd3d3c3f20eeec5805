Clerics have backed Parliament's decision to pass controversial amendments to the election law and are asking the Senate to hasten in their input.The Election Laws (Amendment) Bill has introduced sweeping changes, including a manual backup system for voter identification and transmission of results, which the opposition has disputed.The amendments also outline timelines for the procurement of election ICTs materials in readiness for August 8 polls.The law was acrimoniously passed by Jubilee MPs on December 23, 2016 after the assembly was recalled from recess to discuss the matter.Opposition MPs disputed the amendments and walked out of Parliament in defiance.But Inter-faith Council of Kenyan assistant secretary Stephen Ndicho said the law's passage was constitutional, lawful and in conformity with the Standing Orders."Since the MPs present passed the amendment to the electoral law, which wasn't ultra vires to the constitution or any other law, the Senate also needs to fast track the process," he said.More on this: Election laws: Anxiety as Senate decideRead: Speaker Ethuro pushes senate special sitting on election laws to January 5He said technology breakdown is a global phenomenon and is also likely to occur during the upcoming general elections, which would deny more than 2 million voters in remote areas the opportunity to vote.Ndicho said delaying the matter is detrimental to peace in the country as it would let to a political standoff, pitting the opposition against the government."If both Houses don't act in concurrence in this matter, their difference would cause anarchy and animosity that can compromise parliamentary democracy from thriving in the country at the detriment of peace," Ndicho said.Cord leaders Raila Odinga, Kalonzo Musyoka and Moses Wetangula claimed the government is laying ground to rig the elections.Also read: Raila gives Uhuru nine-day ultimatum on election laws, says demos a last resortBut the clerics association faulted the opposition leaders for rejecting the changes to provide the manual back up in case the electronic elections infrastructure failed."We wish to state that the acrimony that emanated from the voting in parliament two weeks ago where the electoral laws were changed to allow the simultaneous usage of the both manual and electronic voting register in case of signal failure was not informed by truth and reality," IFCK Secretary General James Kamata said."The truth is that all technological gadgets fail one time or another and therefore the idea of having a standby alternative would always be a wise decision, so as to be fair to every voter by not denying them a chance to elect leaders of their own choice."
