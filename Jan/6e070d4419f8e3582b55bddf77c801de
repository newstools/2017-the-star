Tullow Oil PLC announced that it has agreed to transfer 21.57 per cent of its 33.33 per cent interests in Uganda to Total for $900 million. I think that will be seen as a sharp piece of business by Aidan Heavey. StanBic Kenya issued their 2017 Economic Outlook this morning and pronounced&lsquo;&rsquo;In 2017, the GDP is expected to expand by only 5.4 per cent instead of the forecasted 5.8 per cent&rsquo;&rsquo;. Bloomberg carried a report by Felix Njini dated January 9, 2017 headlined &lsquo;&rsquo;Kenyan Central Bank said to warn traders over shilling decline. &rsquo;&rsquo;Executives from some of the country&rsquo;s biggest lenders were summoned to meetings with policy makers last week, the people said, asking not to be identified because they aren&rsquo;t authorised to speak about the issue. Others were telephoned individually and warned against making comments the regulator says are fueling the shilling&rsquo;s decline, they said. Central Bank officials blame speculators for the slide in the currency of East Africa&rsquo;s largest economy, and told bankers to let the shilling be guided by market fundamentals, the people said. The Central Bank&rsquo;s stance is that the more people comment on the currency&rsquo;s movements, the steeper its decline, they saidKenya&rsquo;s shilling has weakened every trading day since December 23, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. I agree with the Central Bank and said this over the weekend.&lsquo;&rsquo;The Kenya shilling closed out the week trading around the 103.70 level and that makes a -1.17 per cent slide versus the dollar since the start of the year. That slide created a flurry of media demand for comment and it never ceases to amaze me how relatively small moves in the shilling create such an outsize hullabaloo.So the shilling has fallen -1.17 per cent versus the dollar since the start of 2017 and -2.167 per cent since November 8. I cite November 8, because that was when Donald J. Trump was elected US president and his election was the starting pistol for a sharp &lsquo;&rsquo;Trump&rsquo;&rsquo; rally&rsquo; Matina Stevis, the Africa correspondent for the Wall Street Journal tweeted In view of @CBKKenya policy and unchanged fundamentals of #kenya economy, it&rsquo;s hard to explain this fluctuation in KES unseen in over a year.Interesting comments from the Kenyan central bank @CBKKenya which does not suffer fools lightly &amp; has invested heavily in supporting the KES.One wonders if persistent rumours the KES is being talked down so political ppl can bring in their USD at high rate for election are true.Aly-Khan is a financial analyst
