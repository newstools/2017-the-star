Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua has hit back at Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka for expelling him from the party.He termed the move as cowardly, adding that he would support President Uhuru Kenyatta in the August 8 polls."Mimi nime furahi sana. Nilikuwa kule kwingine maana nialnza na chama cha wiper. Lakini nilifukuzwa huko na wakanitukana kwa sababu nime simama na rais Uhuru Kenyatta," Mutua said on Saturday.This loosely translate to: " I am so happy. I was on the other side because I started with Wiper but I was chased because I chose to stand with Uhuru.""Whether they like it or not, I will stand and support Uhuru's re-election," he added.More on this: Mutua backs Uhuru, markets Chap Chap partyRead: Uhuru&rsquo;s visit will be a game changer, says MutuaMutua accused Kalonzo of resorting to divisive politics by isolating the Ukambani region from the government.
