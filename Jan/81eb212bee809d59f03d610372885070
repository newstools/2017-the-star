The Kenya Bureau of Standards on Tuesday destroyed substandard goods worth more than Sh30 million in Nairobi. They ranged from steel bars to expired baby diapers. Kebs managing director Charles Ongwae said the products failed scientific tests. &ldquo;The items being destroyed today do not meet requirements after our assessment officer found out they either weigh less, are shorter than required or deficient in chemical composition,&rdquo; he said.The products destroyed included roofing sheets, plastic pipes, banned cosmetics, electric cables, expired food, unbranded sugar, rice and margarine. Ongwae said the goods were seized from several locations in the country. Last year, Kebs destroyed goods worth Sh50 million. &ldquo;We are not happy destroying these products, but if it saves the lives of Kenyans, we will not hesitate to do so,&rdquo; Ongwae said.He commended government&rsquo;s efforts to ensure substandard goods, locally manufactured or imported, do not find their way in the market. Ongwae urged Kenyans to be vigilant when buying any product by confirming presence of the Keb&rsquo;s mark of quality. He urged Kenyans to verify if a product is certified by Kebs by sending an SMS to 20023. In October last year, Kebs destroyed counterfeit and substandard goods worth Sh12.5 million that were seized from markets and shops in Mombasa county.
