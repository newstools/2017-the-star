HRW has raised concern about the arrest and detention of a prominent South Sudanese lawyer by Kenyan authorities.Dong Luak is a known activist and human rights advocate who served as secretary general of the South Sudan Law Society until 2013.Luak, a refugee, has been at Nairobi Area Police Headquarters since January 23. The international rights lobby said in a statement that he has been denied access to legal counsel and is subject to a deportation order.&ldquo;He has been a vocal advocate for human rights in South Sudan for many years, and could face serious mistreatment if returned to South Sudan,&rdquo; said Leslie Lefkow, deputy Africa director at HRW.&ldquo;Kenyan authorities should respect his rights, allow him access to legal counsel and United Nations refugee officials, and immediately halt any deportation proceedings against him."Lefkow added that the unlawful deportation from Kenya to South Sudan will expose Luak to persecution.Luak fled to Kenya in August 2013, after receiving death threats following his defense of Pagan Amum, the former secretary general of South Sudan&rsquo;s governing party, whom the South Sudan government had accused of treason."Since South Sudan&rsquo;s conflict began in December 2013, Luak has continued publicly to denounce human rights abuses and corruption by South Sudanese government officials,' said HRW."He joined South Sudan&rsquo;s opposition forces &ndash; known as the Sudan People&rsquo;s Liberation Movement-in-Opposition (the &ldquo;IO&rdquo;), led by former Vice-President Riek Machar &ndash; as the group&rsquo;s deputy chairman for justice and human rights."The organisation noted that in October 2015, Luak was brutally attacked at his home in Nairobi by men thought to be linked to South Sudan&rsquo;s security services.Kenyan law, the 1951 Refugee Convention and the regional African Union treaty on refugees prohibit refoulement, the return of a refugee &ldquo;in any manner whatsoever&rdquo; to a place where their life or freedom would be threatened.In recent years, Kenya has unlawfully deported several prominent opposition members from neighbouring countries. This was despite their recognition as refugees under Kenyan law and protests by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).There are serious concerns that the same fate, or worse, await Luak if Kenya forces him to return to his country, HRW warned.&ldquo;He is at serious risk of arbitrary detention, torture, and other abuses if returned to South Sudan. Kenyan authorities need to respect their obligations under international and Kenyan law and ensure he is protected,&rdquo; said Lefkow.Luak's case comes after last November's deportation of prominent South Sudanese politician James Gatdet, who acted as Machar&rsquo;s main spokesperson. Gatdet was arrested upon arrival in South Sudan&rsquo;s capital, Juba, and has since been held, without charge, at the headquarters of South Sudan&rsquo;s National Security Services (NSS).Read: SPLM-IO asks Kenya to release Machar spokesman, condemns planned deportationAlso read: UNHCR fears for Machar spokesman's safety after deportation from KenyaKenyan authorities were not immediately available for comment.
