The National Super Alliance will hold its first rally in Tononoka Ground, Mombasa, end of this month, ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi has said.The announcement came shortly after the former Deputy Prime Minister met Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho at the Serena Hotel. &ldquo;My meeting with Mombasa governor was cordial and the political rally was part of the agenda,&rdquo; Mudavadi said on Wednesday.The rally is believed to have been generated from the discussion.Joho said they discussed several national issues among them, the poor state of the nation under the Jubilee administration and the unity of the coalition going into the next general election.Mudavadi, who is the pioneer of the NASA movement, has denied claims the opposition will disintegrate once one of them is nominated as the flagbearer to face President Uhuru Kenyatta in the August 8 general election.On Thursday, Uhuru&rsquo;s Jubilee Party dismissed NASA as a mirage that will disintegrate much like opposition leader Raila Odinga&rsquo;s Pentagon.Speaking on the phone, the ANC leader said the opposition will unite to remove the Jubilee administration, which he said has failed to deliver its promises to Kenyans.Mudavadi said the opposition is determined to unite and bring political change in the country. He said the opposition has resolved to put their political ambitions aside and unite under the umbrella of NASA to win the polls.Raila and Mudavadi sealed the deal to form an alliance on December 6 last year during a tour of Laikipia county. Other members include Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper) and Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula (Ford Kenya). Their goal is to have a strong force that will remove the Jubilee administration from power.NASA is expected to include Kanu chairman Gideon Moi and secretary general Nick Salat. But Uhuru is said to have phoned Gideon and advised him against joining the alliance.Joho said he appreciates Mudavadi&rsquo;s efforts to reach out to all sections of the country and encouraged him to ensure no area in Western is left behind.In mid-December, Mudavadi said the National Super Alliance is his brain child, and he will settle for nothing less than being its flagbearer. He asked trade unions, civil society, youth and women&rsquo;s groups across the country to join him in removing Jubilee from power &ldquo;because they are corrupt, inept, tribal and have failed to unite Kenyans&rdquo;.
