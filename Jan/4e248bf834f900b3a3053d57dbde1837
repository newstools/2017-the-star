Soon.Gloria spoke to Word Is, about how her latest single is largely influenced by her real life situation.She said Narudisha is adapted from the Bible verse, Joel 2:25 that reads, "And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the cankerworm, and the caterpiller, and the palmerworm, my great army which I sent among you."The video of the song will be released next month.She says it is a "prophetic message for me and any person who feels they have lost time, chances, hope, faith, whatever it is... the Lord says I will restore it."She was referring to her very public breakup and eventual separation from Pastor Omba whom Gloria accused of cheating on her during their marriage.Speaking about how she dealt with her heartbreak, Gloria said."I thank God for being able to get peace, it wasn't hard to get over, there was the challenge of media especially if you have a public life but I managed to pull out, stand up strong and hold my head high."But it seemed time has healed her wounds and she has swiftly moved on."I have lost in life. There was a time in life, I was crushing but the Lord held me. I had lost myself and I found myself, got my sanity back and got my peace back," Gloria Muliro told Word Is.
