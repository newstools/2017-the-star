Fire razed 12 kiosks in Kisii town on the Kisii-Kilgoris road on Monday night and the fire brigade was attacked by hooligans.Plot owner Simon Abuki alleged the fire was started by someone contesting land ownership. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;tcaused by an electric fault. I suspect an individual with ill motives torched the kiosks,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;I am really stressed because this is where I earn my daily bread.&rdquo; Tenant Elizabeth Kwamboka said she lost Sh100, 000 merchandise &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to do, because I depended on the business,&rdquo; she said Kwamboka said the county failed to respond to calls in time. But county official Julius Tinega said his team responded within minutes. &ldquo;Those claiming the brigade took time to respond are lying,&rdquo; he said.
