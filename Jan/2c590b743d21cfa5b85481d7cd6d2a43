Four-time world steeplechase champion Ezekiel Kemboi will be seeking to extend his dominance in the water and barrier event when he parades at the 2017 London World Championships in August.Kemboi will be specifically looking to reclaim his place at the top after missing out on a medal during last August&rsquo;s Rio Olympic Games.Kemboi was denied the bronze medal after Frenchman Maihedine Mekhisi appealed on the Kenyan&rsquo;s line infringement, leaving him infuriated.&ldquo;I am very focused for the next World Championships. You know what happened in Rio and I am training hard to prove a point in London,&rdquo; Kemboi said.Last month, Kemboi blasted National Olympic Committee of Kenya officials claiming they failed to act fast against Mekhisi&rsquo;s move.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where they were but I think they were not serious with their work because had they appealed within the required period of 30 minutes, I could have retained my medal,&rdquo; furious Kemboi said.Kemboi, who is considered the all-time king of steeplechase in the country, has ruled the speciality for the last 18 years. He got his maiden international gold in steeplechase at the 2001 Africa junior championships in Mauritius and this was followed with the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, where he won a silver medal.His biggest breakthrough, however, came at the 2003 World Championships in Paris, where he also won a silver medal before settling for his first gold medal at the Athens Olympics in 2004, when the current Olympic champion Conseslus Kipruto was in class four.He won his first gold medal at world championships in Berlin in 2009 and will be seeking his fifth title in London this year. &lsquo;Baba Yao&rsquo; as he is commonly referred to locally, said discipline and hard work has been his secret in his 18-year athletics stint.&ldquo;It has not been easy being in form for all these years but discipline and hard work in training has enabled me to stay fit,&rdquo; Kemboi explained. The athlete is known to be selective in Diamond League with key priority given to representing the country on international stage. &ldquo;As an athlete you must carefully plan your season. You are not supposed to run more races and get exhausted easily. Plan your career,&rdquo; he said.This year, the country will be seeking to make a repeat performance at the World championships after topping the world two years ago in Beijing.
