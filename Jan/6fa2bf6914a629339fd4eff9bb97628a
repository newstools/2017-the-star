The Kenya Meat Commission has announced plans to buy livestock from farmers in counties that have been adversely affected by drought.KMC managing commissioner Joseph Learamo said in Samburu on Friday that the agency has set aside Sh170 million for the programme.Learamo said that they will buy the animals at a maximum of Sh18,000 each from 14 counties that have been singled out."KMC has been given a mandate by the government to do the off-take from the worst affected counties for a start," said Learamo.Samburu is among the affected counties where more than 120,000 residents facing severe drought and hunger.Others that have seen rampant animal deaths include Kwale, Kilifi and parts of North Eastern region where rains failed.Governor Moses Lenolkulal said Samburu East and Samburu North sub-counties are the most affected by the ongoing drought."The county government has also channeled funds for the offtake programme before the animals die of hunger," Lenolkulal said. The KMC commissioner said that they will also destock areas where animals are weak and cannot be transported to Nairobi."The weak animals that cannot be transported to Athi River will be slaughtered for consumption by residents," the commissioner said.He added that the commission will continue to monitor the drought situation and see how farmers can be saved from further losses.Read: State to spend Sh9.2billion in three months to mitigate drought - CS Kiunjuri
