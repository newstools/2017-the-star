The top political leaders on both sides of the political divide have delivered New Year messages focussing on the conduct of the 12th General Election. Their messaging is remarkable for its hardening of the electoral battle lines. It will enthuse their partisans &ndash; but worry all other thoughtful people of goodwill. As a nation Kenyans have begun one of their most important years ever. We need to count our blessings and define our banes, making sure that we have learned from our errors.Twenty-seventeen is the kind of year that takes only one fatal political error to cost life, limb, stability and national treasure on an unacceptable scale. The top players on the political scene must take the greatest care that chaos does not for whatever reason break out.Whatever the outcome of the election, including a new national government or a renewed one, it will mean new agendas nationwide.And Kenyans are focussed on one national desire: An eminently free, fair, transparent and credible election.
