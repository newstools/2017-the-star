Kenya Bureau of Standards (KEBS) detectives on Tuesday seized more than 1200 opaque 10-litre water containers in a swoop.The standards team, in this regard, froze the packaging of the commodity on such containers on safety grounds.In a notice seen by the Star, Kebs said that it will conduct surveillance in certain 10 companies to ascertain compliance to the directive.The agency said that companies that go against the order will face legal action without any further reference."Kenya bureau of standards issues notice to bottlers at the Coast region to stop usage of opaque containers in packaging of drinking water," Kebs said.The statement further indicated that owners should withdraw all the products packaged in such containers from the market.KEBS regional boss Martin Nyakiamo could not be reached for further clarification on the order.In October 2016, KEBS officials shut down the Coca-Cola company bottler at Mtwapa after some cotton wool were found in Dasani drinking water.The incident later attracted to arrest and questioning of 22 Mombasa MCAs on a mission to inspect the bottling plant following the impurities claim.Read: EACC questions 22 Mombasa MCAs over bribery at Coca Cola plant in Kilifi
