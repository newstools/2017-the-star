The parliamentary legal affairs committee has approved Wafula Chebukati for appointment as the IEBC chairman and okayed six others as commissioners.The Justice and Legal Affairs Committee chaired by Ainabkoi MP Samuel Chepkong&rsquo;a met yesterday and adopted the report recommending their appointment.This is despite opposition from Wajir woman representative Fatuma Ibrahim and Homa Bay Town MP Peter Kaluma, who wanted one nominee - Consolata Nkatha - rejected.Nkatha has been accused of defrauding the National Museums of Kenya of Sh280 million.Others approved are former ambassador to Russia Paul Kurgat, Margaret Wanjala (a member of the Taita Taveta Public Service Board), UN employee Roselyn Kwamboka, Egerton University don Abdi Guliye, and Boya Molu, the judiciary deputy director for human resource.The committee, finished vetting nominees yesterday, will table its report in the National Assembly on Tuesday next week.National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi has convened a special sitting to approve the IEBC nominees and former Anglican Archbishop Eliud Wabukala as chairman of the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission.MPs will debate the report and if satisfied approve all the nominees for formal appointment by President Uhuru Kenyatta to take charge of preparations for the August 8 General Election.Parliament can also reject all the nominees, or some.If approved, the electoral commission bosses could assume office on Wednesday to oversee the mass voter registration exercise targeting more than six million new voters.The current IEBC commission which last year gave President Uhuru notice of intention to resign will formerly quit office once the nominees are sworn in. The month-long voter listing process kicks off on Monday countrywide with political parties shifting their focus to the exercise in a battle for numbers.All nominees told the legal affairs committee they will work hard to restore public confidence in the electoral commission.JLAC members said they were impressed with Kwamboka&rsquo;s experience. They said she has a firm grasp of global electoral matters, electoral reforms and public governance.
