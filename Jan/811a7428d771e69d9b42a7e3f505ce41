Five ODM ward representatives from Kakamega, Vihiga and Busia counties yesterday accused Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula of rocking opposition unity using &ldquo;juvenile&rdquo; tactics.Wetang&rsquo;ula&rsquo;s remarks that he does not recognise the National Super Alliance were calculated to create friction within the opposition to benefit the Jubilee Party, they said.They are Ben Ombima, Nuru Mohammed, Josephat Munayi, Nathan Okila and Cleophas Malala.&ldquo;Wetang&rsquo;ula should focus his energy on wiping out Jubilee from his Bungoma county backyard instead of fighting fellow opposition leaders. We don&rsquo;t care about the name of the united opposition as long as Jubilee is uprooted [from power],&rdquo; Ombima said.He said Wetang&rsquo;ula should differentiate between matters to be discussed in the boardroom and those to be discussed in the media.One opposition candidateThe NASA agenda is being pushed by ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi to create a super opposition. It is expected to be launched soon.During opposition aspirants&rsquo; meeting at the Bomas of Kenya on Wednesday, Mudavadi, Wetang&rsquo;ula and Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka said they will field a single candidate on a united opposition platform.But a day later, Wetang&rsquo;ula said he does not recognise NASA and has never been involved in negotiating its formation.What&rsquo;s your stand?Yesterday, Malala said Wetang&rsquo;ula could be looking for an excuse to bolt from a joint opposition.&ldquo;He has taken a local fight to the national platform and this is juvenile. He should come clean and tell Kenyans his problem is Mudavadi&rsquo;s presence in an expanded opposition. He should tell us who he is working for,&rdquo; he said.Human rights activist Ken Wafula asked Wetang&rsquo;ula to tread carefully so he&rsquo;s not branded a traitor, as most Kenyans have no problem with NASA.&ldquo;Wetang&rsquo;ula should know that only God knows who will be the first Luhya President. It should not be Luhya leaders working against opposition unity when all Kenyans agree on the way forward,&rdquo; he said.Wetang&rsquo;ula, Mudavadi, Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale and Vihiga Senator George Khaniri said they will remain united in the opposition. But analysts have said the truce may not last much longer.
