Knut boss Wilson Sossion has said he is not part of any cartel in Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i's Education ministry.Sossion has been critical of the CS's reforms in the sector; he most recently said the 2016 KCSE examination results were cooked and that a forensic audit was needed.More on this: Knut demands forensic audit of 2016 KCSE resultsAlso read: Prophets of doom will not deter Education ministry's thorough work - Matiang'iMatiang'i said on Tuesday that "prophets of doom' who criicised the results will not stop him from leveling the playground for all learners.But Sossion noted on Wednesday that they did not appreciate mediocrity and would be very happy if members of the cartels were prosecuted.He underlined that the education system must ensure candidates and learners move on to next level as this is the generation expected to drive the economy."We would love to see a better Kenya, a better tomorrow. Kenya would be good if we ensure transition to the next level is almost 100 per cent," he said.But the secretary general insisted that Matiang'i doctored the results and said it was a wrong move."If it was to send students to different career paths, then it is wrong. In the manner the examination was conducted we will not achieve Vision 2030," he said.Noting they were only calling for re-marking and the procedure used in the exercise was wrong."We are concerned about the way the results were processed after marking. Raw marks were deployed to a central processing system where one grading system was used," he said.Sossion said the chief examiner of every subject marks 10 per cent of what the team leaders do and cautions on deviation."An award ceremony follows and the final proposal for a grading system of a particular subject is tabled for the examiners to [look at and make a decision]. That is what we call moderation," he said.Sossion said the markers then write a report at the end of the period and give their views."Grading is centered on the examiners and this was never done in the 2016 KCSE exam," he said on Citizen TV on Wednesday."There was a big shift in 2016 because a key process in the system was skipped giving us and Kenyans unreliable results. It is impossible for 80 per cent of students to score Es."The teachers' union boss said the ministry cannot eliminate existing problems by creating bigger ones."How does the change in the grading system minimise cheating? It is quite a tragedy to use a uniform grading system across the subjects for marking," he said."We cannot use the grading system for Mathematics to grade English."Sossion has faulted the rush in releasing the results, saying it was "insane" for the entire country to get a total of 141 As, compared to 2,685 in 2015.Matiang'i said all the 88,929 candidates who scored C+ and above would be absorbed into public universities. He said only 4,645 candidates scored grade A&ndash; (minus), 10,975 attained B+, while 17,216 scored B plain.A total of 55,952 candidates scored between C plus and B minus.More on this: KCSE 2016 results: Over 183,200 candidates to miss university slots after scoring 'D-', 'E'Read: KOT crack jokes about Matiang'i after early release of KCSE 2016 results
