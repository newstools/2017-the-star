Former ODM CEO Magerer Langat has said that he will spill the beans of secrets he gathered from Raila Odinga during his time at the party.Magerer, in response to former TNA secretary general Onyango Oloo's claims that he had damning information of how Jubilee rigged the 2013 poll, said the revelations will give ODM a rough ride towards the August 8 general election."I have crucial damaging secrets that will enable me convince most Kenyans to back President Uhuru Kenyatta and deputy president William Ruto in the next election," he said at Kedowa market during campaigns for Fred Kirui who is running for Kericho governor.The Kipkelion West MP aspirant said the information will defeat Oloo's claims &ndash; which the latter said will help ODM leader Raila Odinga win the presidency."Unlike me who left ODM loaded with crucial secrets enough to destroy the party's popularity ahead of general election, Oloo left TNA empty handed. He has nothing to offer Raila," he said.Read: Jubilee hits back at 'tribalist' Oloo over defection to ODMAlso read: Arrest 'bitter' Onyango Oloo for claiming Jubilee rigged 2013 poll - Muthomi Njuki Magerer, who recently defected to Jubilee Party, urged residents of Rift Valley to register as voters in large numbers before the February 14 deadline of the 30-day mass listing.
