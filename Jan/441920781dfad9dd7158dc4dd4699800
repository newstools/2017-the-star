Two hundred instructors at youth polytechnics in Kisii county yesterday staged a peaceful demonstration over the government&rsquo;s failure to employ them on a permanent basis.They said they will close institutions today unless the governor listens to them. They have been working without pay for three years since their services were devolved in 2013.The tutors were hired by the national government under the Top-up Programme before devolution. But they have never been absorbed by the county governments even after the institutions were put under the devolved units.The tutors started their demonstration from the youth and gender office and marched through Kisii town up to Governor James Ongwae&rsquo;s office at the Agricultural Training Institute.They found the main gate closed after Ongwae (pictured) left and headed to Bobasi subcounty to inspect development projects. Addressing the press, the group&rsquo;s chairman Stephen Nyang&rsquo;au said for several months, Ongwae has been promising them they will get their confirmation letters, but he doesn&rsquo;t fulfill his promise.He said last year, the governor directed county public service board chairman David Kombo to give the instructors letters within 10 days, but he has never honoured the directive. Nyang&rsquo;au said they have been leading desperate lives with their families because they can&rsquo;t even pay their children&rsquo;s fees.He said they will not continue to lead &ldquo;donkey lives&rdquo; while they are providing services. Nyang&rsquo;au said they will close all the institutions until their grievances are addressed. &ldquo;We will l close all polytechnics starting today until Ongwae sees the need to address our concerns.&rdquo;
