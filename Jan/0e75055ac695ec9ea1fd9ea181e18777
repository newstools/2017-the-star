Kenya&rsquo;s foremost political rivals, President Uhuru Kenyatta and Cord leader Raila Odinga, have used their New Year messages to draw the pre-election battle lines.The two, who faced off for President in 2013, and are expected to do so again on August 8, had not a kind word for the other in their messages to the nation.Uhuru used his speech to highlight his government's achievements but at the same time dressed-down the opposition, terming them wholesale &ldquo;power-hungry individuals&rdquo;.Uhuru claimed that the opposition has over the last four years tried to overthrow the government and undermine the Presidency.On the other hand, Raila severely reprimanded the Uhuru Administration, saying Kenyans missed &ldquo;A clean, competent, caring, accountable, inclusive and honest government&rdquo;, for the last four years.He called on Kenyans to vote out the Jubilee government in August, claiming Uhuru and his troops would use &ldquo;corruption money&rdquo; to influence the election.In his pre-recorded televised address at 9.30pm from State House, Mombasa, the President said he was seeking a second term because he wanted to complete what his government had started.&ldquo;It will be my great privilege to run as a candidate to remain your President for another term. My reason for running is to complete the work that we have started with great energy, and to ensure that this nation can continue to rise in the world,&rdquo; Uhuru said.He went on to highlight the achievements of his administration as well the challenges that the government faces, but his speech was not complete without assailing the opposition.Uhuru told off Raila and his colleagues for the planned street protests against amendments to the election laws that were planned for January 4 but postponed.&ldquo;We will not allow our efforts and those of Kenyans to be destroyed by politicians who seem to have embraced the lesson that confrontation and provocation are the only way for them to operate politically. They have announced demonstrations and even the so-called &lsquo;mass action&rsquo; in the coming days. Let us be honest with one another when assessing what they mean by mass action,&rdquo; Uhuru said.He said that the opposition had in the in the past used the phrase mass action as an excuse to announce, &ldquo;Violence is on the way&rdquo;.&ldquo;I tell our young people, do not allow yourselves to be used so badly. These people care nothing for you; their way is the way of division and agitation, not development and building,&rdquo; Uhuru said.He said Kenyans must be honest in assessing their actions since the last election, saying Raila had refused to accept the results in good faith.&ldquo;They have kept up a hue and cry that they were the victims of rigging, despite no credible election observer agreeing. They have threatened to make Kenya ungovernable,&rdquo; Uhuru said.He added, &ldquo;They have shouted insults in rallies and held the Presidency &mdash; which belongs to all Kenyans &mdash; in contempt. They have even in the past threatened to march to the seat of government and overthrow the government of the people. This is not opposition politics, this is disruption and undermining of a country.&rdquo;He said that he will do all to reject such tactics and urged all Kenyans to reject them as well.&ldquo;Until when must we play with the fire of violence to get power-hungry individuals into office?" Uhuru asked.He reiterated that Kenya will hold elections in August and the polls will be free, fair and transparent and all contestants are expected to accept the results.But in his written statement sent to newsrooms, Raila painted the administration as corrupt and inept, saying it was immersed in graft, lacked patriotism and had run down the economy.The former Prime Minister said Kenyans were aware Uhuru and his Jubilee brigade will use the money they have &ldquo;stolen to corrupt the electoral process&rdquo;.He alleged that the government would use this money to buy support and steal the elections, thereby creating a vicious cycle of a corrupt regime, stolen elections and yet another corrupt regime.&ldquo;We must stand up against the Billionaires&rsquo; Club. We can achieve it on August 8 following on the footsteps of nations like Tanzania, Nigeria, Ghana, Senegal and Gambia that have blazed this trail,&rdquo; Raila said.The Cord leader called on Kenyans to use the August election to &ldquo;close our dangerous dance with the Jubilee regime&rdquo;.He went on: &ldquo;The government wants to run our lives instead of enabling us to run our own lives. It is my appeal to the people of Kenya that we dedicate 2017 to the realisation of a clean, honest, competent, inclusive and caring government.&rdquo;The opposition chief said that Jubilee has had a glaring lack of well-thought-out policy interventions to deal with emerging issues.He added that no competent, caring and accountable government can proceed on holiday when citizens are suffering, as is the case now because doctors and other health workers have been on strike for a month.&ldquo;Fire-fighting has been the official Jubilee policy. Today, it is talking of importing doctors. Is this a sustainable solution? Certainly not," Raila said.Raila said corruption commandeered the country in 2016 in a way Kenyans had never imagined.&ldquo;Top government officials enjoying the patronage of the Presidency joined ranks with elites in big business to plunder public resources in complete disregard of the long-term interests of our nation,&rdquo; Raila said.&ldquo;This conspiracy produced a tiny billionaire class in just four years whose members can buy the latest model of anything at any price anywhere and contribute millions at weekly harambees, while the rest of the population struggle to get basic resources.&rdquo;Raila also said that due to corruption and the ineptness of the Uhuru Administration, the economy was struggling while more Kenyans were suffering from poverty.&ldquo;The Jubilee leadership is essentially the one that Kenyans rejected in 2002. What we have gone through from 2013, compared to the period from 2003, proves that we were right to reject this team when it first attempted to seize power,&rdquo; Raila, who was PM from 2008-2013 in the Grand Coalition administration, said.
