Jammeh has called the bloc's stance "a declaration of war", and said he will defend himself."A major decision on the impasse is expected to be taken at that all-important meeting," said Garba Shehu, spokGambian President Yahya Jammeh meets with with the West Africa head of delegation during the election crisis mediation at the presidential palace Banjul, Gambia December 13, 2016 REUTERSesman for Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari."President Buhari is the chief mediator of the crisis and he is committed to ensuring that the logjam is resolved."Jammeh initially accepted his loss in the December 1, 2016 election, shocking Gambians who have lived through his repressive rule since he took power in a 1994 coup, and triggering celebrations in the streets.But a week later changed his mind, saying the electoral commission had been biased by "foreign influences" and vowing to hang on despite regional and international condemnation.Jammed says ECOWAS has no right to interfere in Gambia's internal affairs, and that Gambians should await the outcome of a legal challenge that his APRC party has lodged at the Supreme Court.
