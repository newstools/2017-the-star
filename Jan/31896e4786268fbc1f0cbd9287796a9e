A damning dossier against a Cabinet Secretary is in circulation. The voluminous petition, alleging massive financial impropriety and mega corruption against the CS &mdash; believed to be one of President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s (pictured) most hardworking ministers &mdash; has been sent to Parliament. The dossier is so detailed and well written it has tongues wagging in overdrive. Is it the work of the National intelligence Service? One thing is not in doubt though: It&rsquo;s the work of insiders within the Jubilee administration who appear to know the CS very well. Even more shocking are claims that the said CS has a fake degree. Could there be enough truth in the claims for a parliamentary probe or is it just bad blood between the minister and his Principal Secretary?***********A top Jubilee politician who recently hit the headlines for inflammatory comments is again on the spot. The man&rsquo;s engineering firm is said to have pocketed millions from government agencies in fraudulent deals. The latest is said to be more than Sh150 million he was allegedly paid by a parastatal to partition its two floors in Nairobi&rsquo;s Upper Hill. It&rsquo;s whispered that the tender was grossly inflated. Those in the know say the rent paid by the parastatal to acquire the flashy new building is also enormous. Perhaps this is the first task for new EACC Chairperson Archbishop (Rtd) Eliud Wabukala, after his overwhelming approval by Parliament yesterday.**********The defection of ex-TNA secretary general Onyango Oloo has dealt a devastating blow to the few ardent supporters of President Uhuru Kenyatta in Nyanza. Many TNA aspirants who defied the ODM wave in Nyanza to vie for various seats previously used Oloo as the bridge to get to State House. Among the orphans, sources whispered to Corridors, is a former radio presenter who was recently handed a parastatal appointment. Others who had hoped to get something through Oloo now have their hopes completely dashed.***********Who is blocking more than 600,000 residents of Eldama Ravine and Koibatek, Baringo county, from benefitting from the Sh5.5 billion Chemususu Dam project? Corridors has reliably learnt that a senior board member at the Rift Valley Water Services Board has been frustrating efforts to award a tender for the distribution of water to nearby residents. The former politician, who is also known for his high appetite for bribes, is now on the spot following his alleged role in the ongoing delay to fast-track the project. The high-end dam, constructed to modern standards, could help alleviate the ongoing drought in the region.
