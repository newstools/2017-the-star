Lecturers in several parts of the country have defied a court order and began their strike for the government to implement a 2013 pay rise agreement.The High Court on Wednesday extended orders barring them from going on strike and directed negotiations with the Salaries and Remuneration Commission, the Federation of Kenya Employers and the Inter-Public University Councils Consultative Forum.Read: High Court stops lecturers&rsquo; strike scheduled for MondayBut the lecturers said they would "rather die than go to back to work" without a deal "as dead people do not need to pay taxes".&ldquo;I have not seen that court order. It seems they are issuing court orders [in a biased manner]," said Kenya Universities Staff Union organising Secretary Johnston Akanga."Why did they go to court yet we had invited them for talks? If it is the court order that is going to kill us as we fight for our rights, let it be."Akanga noted in an address to the media that it is their constitutional right to strike.Reuben Oyamo, Moi University executive committee member, confirmed that lecturers in Eldoret had downed their tools in solidarity with their Nairobi counterparts.&ldquo;The strike is on 100 per cent if not 110 per cent,&rdquo; he said.George Omondi, secretary of UoN's Uasu chapter, said their main issue was the government's refusal to table a counter offer.Omondi said this was despite the fact that they presented their proposals to the Inter-Public Universities Consultative Council Forum in March last year.&ldquo;What we want is for the Education ministry, SRC and our unions to negotiate. Whatever is agreed on is what will shape our next course of action but until that happens, we are not going back to work,&rdquo; he said.High Court Justice Hellen Wasilwa stopped Uasu, the Kusu and their members from engaging in any activity likely to disrupt learning at the institutions."An order is hereby issued restraining Uasu, Kusu, their officials, agents or members from taking part in, calling, instigating or inciting others to take part in an unprotected strike," she said.But in their march, Egerton University lecturers chanted: "Better trained, less pay, no way" and "Egerton University dons on strike for a fair CBA".They also sang 'solidarity forever' while holding hands and marching on Nakuru streets.Machakos University lecturers marched on Makueni-Machakos road, waving placards and singing songs denouncing the government.They maintained that they will not return to work unless the government implements the 2013-2017 CBA signed in 2012.Njoki Ndung'u, Uasu's Machakos chapter secretary general, said they spent a lot of time and money acquiring their qualifications yet the pay does not march their input.&ldquo;A university professor was among the best paid professionals when the country gained independence in 1963, but the government has distorted the pay scheme for civil servants over the years," said Ndung&rsquo;u.Ndung&rsquo;u said the CBA did not entail a percentage payment but a restructuring to ensure those in the civil service and teaching profession were paid equally."Deputy President William Ruto is our student. How much has he spent on his doctorate and how much does he expect to gain from it?" asked Ndung'u.She added that the government should deal with the disparities as other civil servants at their level are earning 200 per cent more.Lecturers had threatened to down their tools if the government did not grant them a 300 per cent pay rise. They want it backdated to July 1, 2013, claiming the government had agreed to it.The CBA proposes that professors, who currently earn Sh211,753, should be paid Sh1.9 million per month and that the least pay for a lecturer increase to Sh350,000 from S99,802.&ldquo;The CBA expires in June so if we don&rsquo;t act now we will have nothing to base our demands on. So this strike will go on for as long as it takes,&rdquo; said Omondi.Staff allied to Uasu, Kusu and KUDHEHIA are participating in the strike.
