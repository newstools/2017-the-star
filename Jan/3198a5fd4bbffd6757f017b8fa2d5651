Nairobi Provincial Cricket Association Twenty20 defending champions Swamibapa bounced back from their opening loss to Sikh Union with a 53 runs win over hosts Nairobi Gymkhana even as the umpires boycotted the matches over their pay arrears by NPCA.With the absence of the umpires, NPCA officials led by chairman Tom Tikolo and fixtures secretary Narendra Patel took over the umpiring roles of the four Super Division matches played.As Swamibapa once again put on a poor show with the bat before edging a poor Nairobi Gymkhana, Stray Lions and Sikh Union were also victorious with wins over Cutchi Leva and Ruaraka Sports Club.Electing to bat, Swamibapa posted 142 for 8 after yet another poor batting display from the champions. Sitting comfortably at 69 for 2 after 10 overs, Swamibapa&rsquo;s middle order crumbled yet again losing six wickets for 73 runs.Naman Patel (42) and Maurice Ouma (24) put on a second wicket stand of 65 in 8.4 overs after they had lost opener Alex Obanda for one run.With Naman and Ouma in the middle Swamibapa were set for a huge score but as soon as Bhavya Thakkar had Naman caught and Abdul Najmi run out Ouma, the visitors struggled to maintain the tempo, losing wickets regularly before finally ending on 143.Rakesh Kahar and Emmanuel Bundi added 18 and 15 respectively as Swamibapa struggled in the middle. In the chase, the home side were on course for reaching the score when skipper Karan Kaul (48) and Harsh Patel (15) put on 54 for the third wicket.But when the two fell, the home side struggled and were all out on 89 with two balls to play.At Samaj School, Stray Lions import Roger Mukasa scored an unbeaten half century to lead his side to a nine wickets win over the hosts.Mukasa&rsquo;s 60 not out saw Stray Lions surpass Cutchi Leva&rsquo;s 105 all out with 60 balls to play. The Ugandan national team opening batsman smashed four sixes and seven fours from just 29 balls.He shared an opening stand of 74 runs with Jay Mehta, who struck four boundaries in his 36-ball knock of 29 runs before he fell in the eighth over to Hiten Vekaria.In comparison, Stray Lions&rsquo; bowling attack fired on all cylinders early in the inning when Charles Waiswa dismissed Chiraq Pindoria for a duck.Shehal Bhuva followed soon after with a duck too when he was run out by Abishekh Chidambraman with no run scored. And despite a third-wicket stand worth 20- runs between Rahul Nathani and Shyam Rabadia, they caved in the middle with three wickets falling to leave them on 20 for 6 from 20 for 2.They rallied back with a 67 runs stand for the seventh wicket between Hitesh Vekaria (45) and Ravindra Vekaria (29) that got them to 87 runs.
