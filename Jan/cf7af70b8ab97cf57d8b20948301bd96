Obiri, of Laikipia Airbase, revealed that she will be hunting for the individual title she last won in 2014.&ldquo;I want to win the individual title again. I also want to do well and see if I can make a passage into the national team to the World Cross in Kampala,&rdquo; said Obiri.She will partner former Commonwealth Games 3,000m steeplechase bronze medallist Mercy Njoroge and former world junior 3,000m champion Veronica Nyaruai.However, the likes of Kahawa&rsquo;s world half marathon champion Gladys Cherono and former Boston marathon winner Sharon Cherop of Armour Brigade are expected to offer a tough challenge as will former Olympics 1,500m champion Nancy Jebet Lagat (Moi Airbase) and Africa bronze medallist Jane Chelagat.KDF and national athletics head coach Julius Kirwa observed that stiff competition is expected on the day as the runners chase both individual and team titles&mdash;for their units.&ldquo;We are expecting very tough competition especially in the men&rsquo;s 10km race which has been reduced from 12km,&rdquo; said Kirwa.&ldquo;We also hope to see younger runners will come and challenge the old guards for this presents a perfect platform for their rise to the top.&rdquo;&ldquo;The relay&rsquo;s will also be interesting for as I understand, allthe units want their top stars to feature,&rdquo; he added.
