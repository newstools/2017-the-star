In bold print on the wall next to the t the east gate is a clear message from the past in the words of the first President of Kenya &ndash; Mzee Jomo Kenyatta. The sign reads: &ldquo;The natural resources of this country &ndash; it&rsquo;s wildlife, which offers such an attraction to visitors from all over the world, the beautiful places in which these animals live, the mighty forests which guard the water catchment areas so vital for the survival of man and beast &ndash; are a priceless heritage for the future. The government of Kenya, fully realising the value of its natural resources, pledges itself to conserve them for posterity with all means at it&rsquo;s disposal. Mzee Jomo Kenyatta, the 1st President.&rdquo; It is ironic that this message is so closely positioned to the planned standard gauge railway route through the Nairobi National Park. Kenya is in need of infrastructure development, but not at the expense of destroying natural resources. It is a well-known documented fact that there are alternative railway routes around the Nairobi National Park.God has put many wonderful treasures on this earth, and the Nairobi park is one such treasure that needs to be kept for future generations. This year will prove to be a critical year in the history of the park. I appeal to President Uhuru Kenyatta to honour the powerful message Mzee Jomo Kenyatta left for future generations to practise, and reroute the SGR around the park.By so doing, he will leave a legacy as the President who saved the Nairobi National Park.
