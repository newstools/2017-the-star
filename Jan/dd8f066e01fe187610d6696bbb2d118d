Former Devolution CS Anne Waiguru is not fit to run for Kirinyaga governor as her integrity is questionable, the Kirinyaga Council of Elders has said.Speaking to the Star on the phone, chairman Bishop Cyrus Githaka said Waiguru has been implicated in the National Youth Service scandal. More than Sh1.6 billion went missing.Waiguru should first be vindicated of any wrongdoing before the Jubilee Party approves her bid, Githaka said.&ldquo;If President Uhuru Kenyatta is to be viewed as fighting graft in government then those with questionable characters should not be allowed to seek his party&rsquo;s nomination,&rdquo; he said.In August last year Waiguru said she will run for Kirinyaga governor on the JP ticket. She resigned as CS in November 2014, citing health reasons, just after the opposition mounted pressure on Uhuru to sack her over the graft allegations.Businesswoman Josephine Kabura last year linked Waiguru to the NYS scam.Six people want to run for Kirinyaga governor, including incumbent Joseph Ndathi, Narc Kenya leader Martha Karua, Kirinyaga Central MP Joseph Gitari, businessman Eliud Wanjao and businessman Murithii Kagai.
