The waiting period for a building permit in Kiambu will now be only 30 days, compared with the previous 60 days.This follows the launch of the electronic development applications systems by the county government.Governor William Kabogo made the announcement on Wednesday.He said the system will curb corruption in the construction industry. There&rsquo;s a building boom because of the county&rsquo;s proximity to Nairobi. Kabogo said it will now take a maximum of 14 days to approve single-family homes. Commercial buildings will take 30 days. &ldquo;The platform is a relief after the tedious manual work that would sometimes take up to six months,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Looking at the bigger picture, the online approvals system curtails corruption because enforcement officers visited construction sites to demand bribes.&rdquo; Kabogo spoke in Juja, where he inspected county projects.He said payments will be made through automated revenue collection, eliminating manual cash handling.With the new system, architects, planners and all contractors eyeing projects within Kiambu county, will have to register and go through a vetting process to verify their qualificaitons.&ldquo;Property developers, other interested parties will find out the numbers of successfully completed projects that an architect, physical planner and engineer has undertaken,&rdquo; Kabogo said. Lands executive Eunice Karoki said the system is only accessible to authorised persons
