The Kenya Accreditation Service has confirmed it suspended the licence issued to industrial laboratory services firm Agric-Quest Laboratory Supplies following an assessment on December 12. The firm was at the centre of the dispute between the Catholic Church and the Ministry of Health over polio and tetanus vaccines, which the church said were contaminated. Kenas said its investigators found the laboratory did not meet requirements for the accreditation in 2012.The agency indicated the company lodged a formal complaint protesting against the assessment and subsequent suspension on December 6. Investigations by an independent team and Kenas are ongoing in line with procedures that should be followed when handling such complaints, the state agency said.
