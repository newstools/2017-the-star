Lamu&rsquo;s drought-stricken residents yesterday urged the government to declare the drought a national disaster. They said this would enable them to get urgent help as their lives and those of their livestock are under threat. Many residents reported they go as long as a week without food. They said many pupils no longer go to school because they are hungry. More than 30,000 residents face starvation.
