Retired President Daniel Moi underwent a minor surgery at Aga Khan Hospital, Nairobi on Friday evening to correct a problem in his knee.Moi's press secretary Lee Njiru said that the procedure was to ease pain on the knee."After the procedure, performed under local anaesthesia, a hale and hearty Mzee Moi was discharged and is recuperating at his residence," Njiru told the Star on Saturday.A source at the hospital intimated to the Star in confidence that it was the first time that Moi was admitted using his real name."In the past, he has been using pseudo names to erase suspicion," the source said.He said that there was tight security at the facility when the former President was undergoing treatment.The source did not specify how long he took at the facility for the procedure."He was brought in at around 4pm. There was security all over the place," the source privy to the operation told the Star.
