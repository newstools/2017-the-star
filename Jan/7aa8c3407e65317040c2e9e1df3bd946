IG Joseph Boinnet has denied that political factors motivated the withdrawal of Governors Hassan Joho and Amason Kingi's security.The government withdrew the bodyguards of the Mombasa and Kilifi governors on Friday without giving a clear explanation.But sources said the move may have been because the two governors dressed down President Uhuru Kenyatta over projects he had launched during his tour of the Coastal region.Boinnet, who spoke to NTV on Sunday, noted that the measure was undertaken by the Coast regional commander."The Joho-Kingi row is purely coincidental. We are just reorganising operations," he said. "...The withdrawal was purely a Mombasa and Kilifi counties matter."Boinnet further said governors enjoy police protection based on the provisions of an existing policy, which he said most of them abide by.The Inspector General of Police further noted that having a gun is a privilege and that governors are entitled to them but with limitations."It is not an absolute right," he said, and reiterated that their operation did not affect other counties.Asked to specify the reason why Joho and Kingi's security was withdrawn, Boinnet said: "That's an operational detail I cannot talk about. I have given sufficient answers."Early Sunday, State House denied that the withdrawal was political, spokesman Manoah Esipisu saying it was part of the reorganisation of the regional command structure.He asked the two governors to seek answers to their questions from the regional commander.Read: Joho, Kingi security detail fiasco &lsquo;not political&rsquo;ODM leaders asked Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery to reinstate the security that was withdrawn on Friday.They had initially given Nkaissery a two-day ultimatum on the matter but later said they would deliberate with the Cord NEC on the next course of action.Mvita MP Abdulawamad Nassir said among officers withdrawn were GSU and Administration Police.An official within Joho's camp said among withdrawn officers were four bodyguards who worked on rotational basis, three uniformed officers who used to guard his home and at least two officers at his office.The politicians could not also verify if the two Governors had their firearm licences revoked.Read: ODM leaders ask Nkaissery to reinstate Joho, Kingi security Also read: Cord divided over Joho, Kingi security detail
