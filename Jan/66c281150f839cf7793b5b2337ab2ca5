The KCSE exam results are a reflection of each candidate&rsquo;s level of preparedness, Kisii Deputy Governor Joash Maangi said yesterday.He and Nyaribari Chache MP Richard Tong&rsquo;i criticised calls for a forensic audit of the results.The Kenya National Union of Teachers and Cord leader Raila Odinga want an audit of the results.They say the number of students who failed is too high.Raila, for instance, said it is illogical that only 15 per cent of the 577,000 candidates who sat the exam will enrol in university.On Sunday Knut secretary Wilson Sossion alleged that the results were doctored. The union says the exam was not moderated during marking.But Maangi and Tong&rsquo;i said it is improper for leaders to criticise Education CS Fred Matiang&rsquo;i&rsquo;s efforts to ensure credible exams.&ldquo;They should instead commend him for restoring the credibility and integrity of [national] exams,&rdquo; Maangi said.Tong&rsquo;i urged the leaders to accept Matiang&rsquo;i&rsquo;s reforms. &ldquo;The CS is moving in the right direction and thus, there is need for those claiming that the results were cooked to accept the steps he has made to bring in the examination industry,&rdquo; he said.Some church leaders have also joined the calls for an audit.Bishop Robert Langat of the Africa Gospel Church on Sunday said the drastic decline in the number of students with good marks is worrying and raises questions.Knut said the results do not reflect the true performance of candidates. Sossion said the union had identified clear breaches in the marking process that were overlooked.All candidates who scored C+ and above will be absorbed in public universities, creating a conundrum for private universities and parallel programmes, which traditionally enrol those in this cadre that have been left out.
