The letter sent to county secretary Robert Ayisi was signed by the union's two branch secretaries Boniface Waweru and Benson Olianga and copied to Governor Evans Kidero.&ldquo;Despite our efforts to ensure that the CBA is concluded within a reasonable time frame, the county public service board directed that the negotiation process be held in abeyance,&rdquo; it read.&ldquo;Take notice that if you do not meet our demand, all employees shall parade at City Hall beginning January 10 until all grievances are fully resolved."Speaking to the Star on phone on Thursday, Ayisi asked the workers to be patient saying negotiations were ongoing.&ldquo;They are aware of this. So they should give it time. In the end a CBA will be signed,&rdquo; he said.But Waweru: &ldquo;The information and excuses they give us are not helpful. If IFMIS is not working, they should go back to the manual system. We&rsquo;re sure the county has received money from the national government."Also read: Sh600m saved monthly after fake workers cut from payroll
