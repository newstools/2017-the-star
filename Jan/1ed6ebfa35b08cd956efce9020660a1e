AFC Leopards are planning to take up the rehabilitated Embu Stadium as their training base and also use it for home matches.The Kenya Premier League giants have plans to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the county government led by Embu county Governor Martin Wambora on the use of the facility. Club&rsquo;s secretary general, Oscar Igaida and chairman Dan Mule, who visited the governor and later toured the stadium, said they are keen to relocate the team&rsquo;s pre-session training to the stadium from Nairobi and Western Kenya.Igaida and Mule said they are impressed with the standard of improvement at the stadium. They said as it is, the facility is better than Nairobi City stadium and are more than willing to shift base from the capital city.Igaida said they have a lot of fans in Mt. Kenya area, especially in Embu, Meru and Kirinyaga, whom they want to satisfy by bringing home matches near them.He said they will stage a friendly match next month between AFC Leopards and Embu football club in a bid to announce their arrival in the Central Kenya town.Mule said they will also be scouting for players to recruit from Embu County and its environs and are impressed with the way the Embu County has embraced sports. Wambora said they are going to finalise on the remaining areas including toilets and showers and will soon add more sitting area in the stadium, which has a capacity of 20,000 people.He said flood-lights will also be erected to enable matches to go on after dark. He said Phase 2 of the development at the stadium is almost complete and that they are entering into Phase 3, where more facilities will be put in place. Wambora said they will use the proceeds from the stadium to improve the facility. Wambora described the Embu Stadium as a cultural heritage for the area, saying they will use it to encourage local tourism.
