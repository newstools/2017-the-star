The state has not offered medics two packages, the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union officials have said.The union dispelled reports that the government pushed the lowest salary to a gross of Sh180,000 for a fresh graduate.Secretary general Ouma Oluga also denied they are demanding a 300 per cent salary increase.&ldquo;We called for the strike that enters its 27th day [on Saturday] on implementation of of the Collective Bargaining Agreement which had different proposals and not the 300 per cent pay rise,&rdquo; he said.He spoke in Mombasa on Saturday after meeting Coast doctors.The medics began their strike on December 5 last year, demanding that the June 27, 2013 CBA be implemented. They want promotions, higher salaries, better working conditions and the hiring of more medics.Oluga said the CBA entailed financing researches, strengthening internship programmes, among other issues, and not exorbitant salaries.&ldquo;It is an agreement, if implemented, would have seen doctors finding cures for diseases through researches and reducing doctor to patient ratio,&rdquo; he said.Oluga said the public health sector has lost 2,300 doctors to the private sector in two years due to poor pay and working conditions.The secretary general denied that the union has maintained a hard stance, saying it was willing to negotiate but the government was &ldquo;pushing us away&rdquo;.He said they have attended six meetings, three with Labour ministry officials and the rest with Health bosses, without arriving at an agreement.&ldquo;The government is the one frustrating the talks through blackmails,&rdquo; Oluga said.KMPDU national chairman Samuel Oroko said they are skipping work because the CBA has not been implemented. Oroko said hospitals, including the Kenyatta National Hospital &ndash; the largest in East and Central Africa &ndash; is not operating contrary to state propaganda that health has not been severely affected.&ldquo;It is not our wish to ground operations and subject patients to agony. Blame it on the state that has refused to toe our line,&rdquo; he said.Oluga said the CBA will see cartels in medical insurance lose operation grounds.The union blamed the state for failing to protect doctors, resulting to their deaths.&ldquo;Seven doctors have been shot dead in last two years. Does this mean our lives are less important that those of others?&rdquo; Oroko asked.The government on Friday promised to end the doctors' strike before the New Year, but it did not.Government spokesperson Eric Kiraithe said health officials were locked up in a meeting with KMPDU officials the whole of Friday, but it appeared no deal was struck.Speaking in Mombasa, Kiraithe said the strike has been the major challenge the Jubilee administration has faced in 2016.He said the CBA was signed on specific conditional procedures which were yet to be completed when the strike began.Kiraithe said the CBA signed was contingent on and subject to advice from the Salaries and Remuneration Commission and the National Treasury.Doctors argument that billions of shillings lost through runaway corruption could be sufficient to meet their demands does not hold waters, he said.
