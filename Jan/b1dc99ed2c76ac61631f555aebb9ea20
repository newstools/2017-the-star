Deputy President William Ruto has said he has no room for Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto&rsquo;s divisive politics, but he has no personal differences with his former friend-turned foe.He said their political differences began when Rutto started criticising him and opposing development projects by the Jubilee administration in his county and elsewhere.Ruto was speaking on Tuesday at his Sugoi home in Uasin Gishu county where he hosted a Bomet county delegation. He has invited thousands of lawmakers and county officials in huge delegations for Christmas and New Years celebrations. The DP said the Chama Cha Mashinani leader has been consistently trying to divide the Kalenjin community into the North and South. This also led to their falling out, he said.The community will never allow that split to take place, Ruto said. He said he could not be complacent as some leaders stood in the way of projects to improve services and the well-being of Kenyans.Ruto said all elected leaders are duty-bound to unite people and ensure the state&rsquo;s agenda is accomplished.&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no problem with anyone, including my brother Arap Rutto&hellip; But I&rsquo;ll not allow Kalenjins to be divided. Let&rsquo;s fight over other things, not unity and development,&rdquo; Ruto said.Present were MPs Ronald Tonui (Bomet Central), Paul Savibi (Chepalungu), Joyce Laboso (Sotik), Sammy Koech (Konoin), Bernard Bett (Bomet East), Cecilia Ngetich (woman representative) and Wifred Lesan (Bomet).Others were Energy CS Charles Keter, National Water Conservation and Pipeline Corporation chairman Julius Kones, Transport PS John Mosonik and candidates. Ruto denied he has a preferred candidate, between Kones and Laboso, the main ontenders in the Bomet governor&rsquo;s race. Voters will decide, the DP said.
