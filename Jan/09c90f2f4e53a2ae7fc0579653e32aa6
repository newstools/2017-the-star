ODM officials from Yimbo East, Bondo constituency, have expressed concern over plans by some aspirants to undermine ongoing ODM online membership registration.Ward ODM chairman Abele Tindo claimed the hopefuls are conducting a parallel recruitment drive in the region, confusing supporters.He said one aspirant is circulating leaflets of a letter purportedly signed by Cord leader Raila Odinga (pictured), authorising the man to register members. Tindo termed it unacceptable.Youth secretary Gabriel Onjiko said parallel registration misleads members. They spoke in Siaya town on Tuesday. Nominated MCA Rose Angule cautioned aspirants against invoking Raila&rsquo;s name for political mileage. The letters are &lsquo;Raila&rsquo;s Secretariat&rsquo; letterhead.&lsquo; Angule, a hopeful for the Yimbo East MCA, said the letters are fake since all party communications usually come through the ODM secretariat, not Raila&rsquo;s secretariat. She called on ODM&rsquo;s Bondo branch to investigate and report. Anyone involved in the fraud should be disqualified from running, she said.
