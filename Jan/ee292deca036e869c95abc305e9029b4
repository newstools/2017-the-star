The Asian community in Kenya has petitioned President Uhuru Kenyatta to recognise it as the 44th tribe.Farah Mannzoor, a human rights activist, said she has been seeking the inclusivity of the Asian community as Kenyan citizens for five years.She said the petition was signed by representatives of all the Asian communities before it was sent to Uhuru and the State Law office. &ldquo;The people who have supported this petition with me have done it on their own individual capacities and have expressed this in the Freedom of the Right of Expression as enshrined in the Bills of Rights of our Constitution,&rdquo; Farah said.She met members of the Asian communities on Tuesday night at a Westlands restaurant to brief them about the petition.Those in the meeting were Hindus, Muslims &ndash; Sunni and Shia &ndash; Sikhs, Bohra and Goans.Present was Tarbaj MP Mohammed Elmi, who said he fully supports the move. &ldquo;The petition also needs to be forwarded to Parliament&rsquo;s Equal Opportunity Committee for debate,&rdquo; Elmi , a member of the committee, said.Speakers at the event said they contributed to Kenya&rsquo;s pre- and post- colonial eras in construction of the Kenya-Uganda railway. Farah said most Kenyans assume that Asians living in the country are privileged. &ldquo;It is not entirely true. Some do not have a voice and that is why I became a human rights activist after a 17-year career in the airline industry,&rdquo; Farah said.
