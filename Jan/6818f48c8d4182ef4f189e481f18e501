Parliamentary committee on Education chairperson Sabina Chege has urged parents that have gone to court over last year&rsquo;s KCPE results to settle the matter with Kenya National Examination Council out of court.Chege on Wednesday said the parents and the Nyali Primary School&rsquo;s administration should have addressed the matter with Knec before filing a case in court.Chege, who is also the Murang&rsquo;a womna representative, said the majority of Kenyans are happy with last year&rsquo;s KCSE and KCPE results.Eighty-nine parents from the school have questioned the credibility of their school&rsquo;s results, saying the examinations were marked in haste and results released less than a month later.The parents have said the quick marking caused errors in tabulating and tallying results. They said the school&rsquo;s results do not reflect their children&rsquo;s ability and does not tally with the general performance of the school.The school attained a mean score of 337.35 as compared to the 388.66 it scored in 2015, 377.22 in 2014 and 368.94 in 2014. The parents want the court to compel Knec to produce their children&rsquo;s marked scripts for cross checking.But Chege said going to court to sue the examinations agency is a waste of time. &ldquo;Let these parents address the issues they have with their children&rsquo;s results through the right channels, including lodging their complaints with my committee,&rdquo; she said.Chege said the government should put measures in place to find out what occasioned the sharp drop in performance. She said the most important issue to be addressing now is how to help students who scored poorly.
