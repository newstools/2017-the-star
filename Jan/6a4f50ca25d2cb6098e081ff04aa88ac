The sentencing of the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union officials on January 12 came a day before the commencement of the more stringent Contempt of Court Act, 2016.The Act mainly seeks to stop the rampant abuse of court processes and protect the rights of individuals.Justice Hellen Wasilwa's 30-day jail sentence appeared to have caught the officials flatfooted as they later begged for mercy.&ldquo;My lady, I plead with you to give us a lesser sentencing because we are only representing doctors of this country,&rdquo; KMPDU secretary general Ouma Oluga said.The officials are facing jail for failing to call off an illegal strike by doctors.KMPDU officials will not be the first union officials in Kenya to face jail for disobedience of court orders.In July 2013, the Industrial Court fined the Kenya National Union of Teachers and two of its top officials Sh6 million for contempt.Justice Linnet Ndolo fined Knut Sh5 million, secretary general Wilson Sossion and chairman Mudzo Nzili Sh500,000 each for not calling off the teachers' strike as per her orders.The two officials would have been jailed for 30 days if they did not pay the fine.&ldquo;It (contempt fine) has nothing to do with the ego of the judge or the Judiciary; it&rsquo;s about the safeguarding the rule of the law. A court order is not a mere opinion,&rdquo; said Justice Linnet Ndolo.Earlier in 2012, Cotu boss Francis Atwoli was sentenced for three months in jail but was given the option of Sh500,000, which he hurriedly paid.Atwoli was found guilty of disobeying a court order by inciting tea workers to go on strike to protest the use of tea plucking machines in 2010.In October last year, the Director of Pensions Shem Nyakutu was fined Sh200,000 or one month at Kamiti Prison for disobeying court orders on payment of pension arrears to retired teachers.
