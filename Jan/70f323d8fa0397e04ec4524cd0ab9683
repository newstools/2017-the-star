Stop fighting your own tribesman, Emuhaya MP Wilbur Ottichillo yesterday urged Luhya leaders. He welcomed the appointment of ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi as Luhya spokesman.Mudavadi was crowned spokesman on December 31 in Bukhungu Stadium, Kakamega, after a research initiated by Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli. He emerged the most popular Luhya candidate in the survey carried out by researchers from the University of Nairobi&rsquo;s department of political science.Ottichilo urged Ford Kenya leaders Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula and Bonny Khalwale to support Mudavadi. He spoke in Bungoma town. Ottichilo said infighting will divide the community further.He said even though he faults the method used by Atwoli to pick Mudavadi, other leaders have no choice but to support him for the sake of elusive Luhya unity.&ldquo;I know the process Atwoli used might have hurt some people, but let&rsquo;s be realistic. Musalia is the senior-most politician in the region with better chances of [clinching the] presidency and [we should] support him,&rdquo; Ottichilo saidThe legislator said the Mulembe nation has 18 subtribes and it would be wise if elders from all these groups are brought together to give Mudavadi their blessings to chart the community&rsquo;s political direction. He asked Luhya leaders who are unhappy with the development to shelve their ambitions and rally behind Mudavadi to remove the Jubilee government from power.&ldquo;The Mulembe people should listen to the voice of Mudavadi the same way the Kalenjin, Kikuyu, Luo and Kamba people listen to William Ruto, Uhuru Kenyatta, Raila Odinga and Kalonzo Musyoka,&rdquo; he said &ldquo;This region has [never had] a serious presidential candidate because of egocentric leadership. Why should it be a problem supporting Musalia?&rdquo;
