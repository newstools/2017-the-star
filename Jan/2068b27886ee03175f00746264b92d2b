The state should declare the drought a national disaster so international donors can provide relief food and supplies for starving residents, Baringo Senator Gideon Moi has said.He also urged leaders to first address the effects of the prolonged dry spell instead of concentrating on the voter registration drive.&ldquo;It is ironical that leaders are campaigning for mass voter registration of people who are on the verge of dying of hunger,&rdquo; Moi said.He spoke during a funeral on Saturday, where he also urged residents to register to vote in large numbers.Moi said thousands of cattle have died in Samburu, Turkana, Isiolo, Baringo and Kilifi counties and residents&rsquo; lives are also at stake.The senator said nearly 30 out of the 47 counties are hit by famine. &ldquo;We want the government to take measures so that no Kenyan dies of hunger,&rdquo; he said.
