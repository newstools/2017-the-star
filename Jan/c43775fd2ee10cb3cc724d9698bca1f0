The High Court yesterday suspended the extradition case of two sons of slain drug baron Ibrahim Akasha and two foreigners. Baktash Akasha, Ibrahim Akasha, Gulam Hussein and Vijaygiri Goswami are accused of trafficking Sh1 billion heroin in 2014. They are also wanted by a New York court for drug-related crimes. Judge Dorah Chepkowny suspended the hearing at the lower court until she determines an application filed before her. The DPP moved to court seeking orders to quash another court order by trial magistrate Julius Nange&rsquo;a that required it to bring two American officials to testify why they needed the four, yet it had closed the extradition case. The Americans &mdash; New York DPP Mathew Keller and officer Micheal Lockard &mdash; were investigating the four. Defence lawyer Kirathe Wandugi said they want to know why his clients should be extradited. The case will be mentioned on February 23.
