Lugari MP Ayub Savula has said Luhya MPs will lobby their colleagues to approve the nominations of Wafula Chebukati as IEBC chairman and retired ACK Archbishop Eliud Wabukala as EACC chair.He said the Jubilee government has excluded the Luhya community from key state appointments. He said the two are fit for the positions because as Kenyans, they applied and went through due process.&ldquo;There is no law that bars Chebukati and IEBC chief executive Ezra Chiloba from serving on the commission at the same time, just because they come from the same community. We shall defend our own like others do,&rdquo; Savula told the Star on the phone yesterday.The law provides for equitable distribution of resources, including state jobs, he said. President Uhuru Kenyatta nominated Chebukati to replace Issack Hassan.The IEBC selection panel settled on Chebukati alongside High Court advocate Tukero ole Kina on December 23.The panel has urged MPs to probe the two further after a memorandum emerged in the media questioning their suitability and that of commissioner nominee Consolata Maina. Members of the new-look IEBC would include Abdi Guliye, Boya Molu, Maina, Margaret Mwachanya, Paul Kurgat and Roselyne Okombe as commissioners if Parliament approves their nomination.
