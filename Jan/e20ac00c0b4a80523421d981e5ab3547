Residents ofKitusuruyesterday said they fear the controversial proposed Kitisuru Shopping Mall may be built during the elections.In November 2015, City Hall and the National Environment Management Authority approved construction of the mall, despite residents opposition.But the county government later cancelled the plans.The mall was to be built by Shiloah Investments, associated with businessmen Deepak and Mitesh Shah, on Ngecha Road, Lower Kabete opposite Kabete Junior School.Residents have opposed the plans, saying the site is on a river valley and will destroy the serene environment.Governor Evans Kidero said City Hall rejected the plan and that position has not changed.Urban Planning and Housing chief officer Rose Muema in a letter said the change of user was cancelled after a technical committee met on October 30, 2014. Shiloah Investments has defended construction, saying it is aboveboard.However, residents told the Star yesterday that given it's an election year, City Hall and Nema may collude with the developer and issue licences, since most people will be concentrating on the polls."Although the case is in court, we want assurance from the county government and Nema that the mall will not be built. As you know, a lot happens during elections and those are our fears," resident Mark Weru said.Documents obtained from Nema and the county approving the development, shows the mall is supposed to be a seven-storey building on 3.6 acres.Residents through Lakeview Residents Association led by chairman Paras Shah said Nema had ignored its letters.&ldquo;Nema and City Hall are wrong. According to the Nairobi County Integrated Development Plan, Kitisuru is classified as a purely residential area and not commercial. What we are seeing is pure corruption and we will take them to court to stop construction on the land,&rdquo; another resident said.
