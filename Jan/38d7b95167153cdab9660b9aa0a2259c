Garissa Governor Nathif Jama&rsquo;s Aulyhan clan has endorsed him for a second term.Speaking to the press at a Garissa hotel on Saturday, the community&rsquo;s Sultan Hamud Sheikh said all the nine sub-clans of the larger Aulyhan clan have unanimously agreed to back Jama for the second and final term.Sheikh was with elders from all the nine sub-clans of Rer Ali, Afgab, Adankheir, Wafata, Hawis, Sonqad, Abakorade, Qasim and Afwah.&ldquo;As a community, we have made a binding and final declaration. We decided to fully throw our support behind Jama. This is after months of discussions and deliberations that involved representatives from the nine clans,&rdquo; Sheikh said. &ldquo;We, however, want to make it clear that as a community, we will not field any candidate for senator. We will instead support a candidate from any other community residing in Garissa and willing to make an alliance with us.&rdquo;Sheikh said they decided to back Jama because he has done a lot for the people in terms of development. &ldquo;He has also worked hard to ensure peace prevails,&rdquo; he said.Sheikh said the community will discuss candidates who will fill the other seats later.&ldquo;We want to appeal to Garissa residents to support Jama and we assure them of total peace and equitable distribution of resources as has been the case,&rdquo; he said.Jama will battle it out with Ali Korane, who has already been endorsed by his Abdwak clan, in what is slowly shaping up to be a two-horse race.Religious leaders, elders and businesspeople from the Samawadhal and Abduwak met at a Nairobi hotel and endorsed Korane last week.
