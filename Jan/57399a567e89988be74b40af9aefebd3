A deal has been signed to end Joseph Kabila's 15-year rule in the Democratic Republic of Congo - but the president himself has yet to add his signature.On Saturday, Congo's opposition leaders signed a deal with Kabila's party that will require him to step down after elections that must take place before the end of 2017.Mediators from the Congo's Catholic church had been heaping pressure on both sides for weeks to sign an agreement aimed at averting a slide into anarchy and possibly another civil war over Kabila's decision not to step down despite his mandate expiring more than a week ago.If they stick to it, the agreement will deliver Democratic Republic of Congo's first peaceful transfer of power since independence from Belgium in 1960.Marcel Utembi, President of Congo's Catholic Bishops' Conference, leaves after attending mediation talks between the opposition and the government of President Joseph Kabila in Kinshasa, December 30, 2016. /REUTERS"Today, we are happy to head up a political compromise," said Marcel Utembi, President of the Catholic Bishops Conference, before representatives of Kabila's party, including Mines Minister Martin Kabwelulu and Interior Minister Emmanuel Shadary, and its main opposition alliance, signed the deal.Senior ministers backed the deal, which would see Kabila stay on until elections are held by the end of 2017.The country has faced a crisis since Kabila failed to step down earlier in December, when his mandate expired.Elections should have been held in November, and dozens of people have died in protests since then.After the electoral commission cancelled the scheduled vote, citing logistical and financial difficulties in organising them, Kabila formed a 74-member transitional government and said elections would be held in 2018.Representatives of Kabila and his long standing rival Etienne Tshisekedi have been locked in negotiations brokered by Catholic Church leaders since December 8.Neither man has yet signed the final deal, but representatives of both sides said the two men would put their names to the transition agreement later.At the same time, several of Kabila's supporters have floated the idea of changing the constitution to enable him to run for another term, as other African leaders have done.Congolese Government spokesman Lambert Mende addresses the media during talks between the opposition and the government of President Joseph Kabila outside the Conference episcopale nationale du Congo (CENCO) headquarters in the Democratic Republic of Congo's capital Kinshasa, December 31, 2016. /REUTERSIn the meantime, members of the government and the opposition signed it in the final minutes of 2016.Under the deal, Kabila is to lead a transitional government until elections which must be held by the end of 2017.During that period, an opposition politician will serve as prime minister.The document states that Kabila will not seek a third term. The constitution bars him from doing this, but the opposition had feared he might try to amend it to enable him to do.Archbishop Marcel Utembi sees further challenges ahead."It's one thing to have a political compromise but putting it into place is another," he said, after the signing ceremony on Saturday.DR Congo has not had a smooth transfer of power between any leaders since independence from Belgium in 1960.Any failure to implement the deal would worsen instability that has seen scores of people killed over the past four months, many of them protesters shot dead by security forces.
