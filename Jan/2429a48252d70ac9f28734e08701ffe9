Even in the days when Kenya was a single-party state ruled by an all-powerful President, public sector strikes were a source of sleepless nights for His Excellency.For not even the most authoritarian of presidents wants to rule over a deeply dissatisfied population. And few things give cause for greater public dissatisfaction than a strike by health workers.The health workers know this, and so tend to stick to their extreme positions for longer than many other striking workers would. While for the presidency, the matter boils down to having to reconcile the limits of funding available for doctors and nurses salaries, with the desire to see the strike end as soon as possible. This is never easy. In these circumstances, President Uhuru Kenyatta must not relent in his efforts to bring an end to the doctors' strike.His efforts thus far may now have yielded the breakthrough that the nation was praying for. But he must persist as it is &mdash; at this late stage &mdash; only through his intervention that this strike will be called off.
