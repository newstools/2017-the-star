Kenya loses between Sh20-25 billion annually in marine insurance premiums ceded to foreign offshore companies, Maritime Affairs PS Nancy Karigithu has said.She said the country has been losing the money, despite the fact that compensation is not always assured in case of a loss.&ldquo;Despite Kenya being a maritime nation and having enacted Section 20 of the Insurance Act in 1984, the local marine insurance has remained one of the sleeping giants of the maritime industry due to non-enforcement of the law and skewed implementation of international commercial terms,&rdquo; Karigithu said. Her speech was read on her behalf by Kenya National Shipping Line CEO Joseph Juma during the unveiling of Kenya Orient Insurance marine insurance cover for freight, logistics and shipping agents in Mombasa on Thursday.The event was at EnglishPoint Marina in Nyali. Karigithu urged local insurers to be innovative, develop human capital and ability to pay claims while enhancing intelligence gathering to cope with risks such as terrorism, piracy and war. &ldquo;Insurers are expected to up their game in terms of sensitising stakeholders and establishing elaborate ICT infrastructure. They should package their services in a way that offers competitive rates and faster settlement of claims,&rdquo; she said.Kenya Orient launched its first marine insurance product to tap on the extensive maritime industry. Managing director Muema Muindi said they are focusing on innovation to make marine insurance more accessible to large and small players in the import and export business.&ldquo;We strongly support government initiatives to boost marine insurance uptake and are therefore working closely with shippers, freight stations and logistics firms,&rdquo; he said.
