Two flower farm workers, including a woman, died after they were electrocuted in Kasarani estate in Naivasha hours to the New Year.The woman was the first to be electrocuted and efforts by the man to rescue her ended tragically after he too was also killed by the high voltage.John Ochido, a witness, said the woman was hanging her clothes when she was electrocuted.He said part of the hanging line was in contact with a live wire and the woman unknowingly touched it."The woman was first electrocuted and the neighbour who rushed out to assist her suffered the same fate as relatives watched in horror," he said.Ochido blamed poor works on the residential plot for the fatal accident, adding that it would have been avoided if necessary measures had been taken."We fail to understand how the hanging line was connected to the electricity wire and the contractor is responsible for this," he said.An officer said the bodies were taken to Naivasha subcounty hospital mortuary.
