Several wild animals have been killed during raids by suspected Pokot herdsmen on Mugie conservancy and other parts of Laikipa.On Monday night, heavily-armed militias shot up and set fires to farms as they drove vast herds of cattle into the private 49,000-acre conservancy.The attackers used guns, spears, arrows and rungus against workers and guards. Unconfirmed reports indicated at least one staff member was shot in the ambush. Violence erupted when Pokot gunmen opened fire at Kenya Wildlife Service rangers patrolling the conservancy's south western boundary.KWS rangers and Anti Stock Theft Unit (ASTU) have retreated under the force of the huge assault, which resembles recent attacks on other farms and conservancies across Laikipia, for which residents have blamed politicians.Read: These land invasions must be stoppedAlso read: Laikipia conservancy cancels Sh600 million investment after violenceA witness said some of the animals are not poached for their ivory or meat."They just got in the way of the gangs of heavily armed and aggressive young men," he said."Some [wild animals] can be saved by conservation staff while others have to be put out of their misery if they are not found dead."People invading Laikipia's conservancies have, in recent months, attacked and killed hundreds of wild animals which are among Kenya's protected species.The county is the last stronghold of wildlife outside Kenya's national parks and reserves, and is home to 6,000 elephants and other animals including lions and the rare Grevy's zebra.It also has the richest biodiversity of large mammals anywhere in Kenya other than the Maasai Mara.Mugie conservancy used to keep rhinos but had to send them away due to poaching. It is among the most valuable wildlife areas in Kenya.The invaders, who are seeking pasture, have caused fear as they also drive their animals into people's farms.Residents said they go armed with lethal weapons and forcefully take their animals to farms where they destroy crops.Villagers told the media on Tuesday that they were afraid the invasions signaled conflict between locals and migrants.Villages including Maua, Miteta, Kamwenje and Mastoo are among many most affected by the invasion menace.Many have accused Pokot and Samburu politicians of wanting to seize land for themselves and drive out holders of title deeds.They have also accused the government of failing to take action to end the increasing violence.The people want the government to speedily ensure the herdsmen return to their homes and that the violence ends.Githiga MCA Peter Thomi and Laikipia Maendeleo Ya Wanawake Organization (MYWO) Chairlady Irene Wachuka urged the government to restore calm and ensure villagers are not intimidated by the herdsmen.Local leaders cautioned the invaders against going into people's farms, noting this was not only illegal but also a breach of their rights.Read: Laikipia clashes persist as MPs, cops, barons blamedAlso read: Dutch tourists escape unhurt as youths stone their vehicle in Laikipia
