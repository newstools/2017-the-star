DP William Ruto has assured Jubilee Party supporters that they will the election, saying the opposition is no longer as threatening as it once was.Ruto said he and President Uhuru Kenyatta's party were facing a "clueless" opposition in the battle to rule Kenya."In 2013 we faced a formidable opponent. Today we face a rudderless, clueless, disorganised and leaderless opposition," he said.Noting that Jubilee and Raila Odinga's Cord coalition are like day and night, he said the 2013 election was different for four main reasons:Raila was the Prime Minister under President Mwai Kibaki's Grand Coalition Government while Kalonzo Musyoka was the VP.The opposition chief vied for the presidency for the third time in 2013 but lost to Uhuru. He said the election was rigged but a litany of mistakes, internal wrangles, bungled party nominations, confused tactics and poor strategy were also to blame, according to analysts.More on this: [VIDEO] Raila has not learned lessons of 2013 election lossRuto asked Jubilee supporters to have faith in the party as they delivered the pledges they made to Kenyans and will unite all the tribes and faiths."You do not need any evidence other than what you saw in Bomas," he said of the opposition which held its grand meeting on Wednesday."We take the transformation of Kenya seriously.
