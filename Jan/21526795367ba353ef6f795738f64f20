The Nurses Union has appealed to striking doctors to accept President Uhuru Kenyatta's offer and return to work.Knun secretary general Seth Panyako said it was unfair for doctors to prolong the strike, which is in its 36th day, at the expense of poor Kenyans.Speaking in Kakamega on Saturday, Panyako said the doctors can emulate the move by nurses and resume to work as they push for the implementation of the CBA."I want to categorically urge our doctor friends kindly hear the cry of Kenyan people. The have suffered enough. Go back to the table and accept whatever you will be offered. Let us all live to fight another day," he said.Panyako said if doctors prolong the strike they would lose trust with patients who will perceive that they do not care about them."Many families are crying, others have lost their loved ones because their was no doctor to attend to them, let them heed to the call of duty and someday their woes will be resolved," he said.This comes as the national government and governors are expected to meet for the first time and try to resolve the ongoing doctors strike."The meeting will also discuss terms of recruiting new doctors who might include retirees and foreign specialists," Health CS Cleopa Mailu said.This will be the first meeting by the two levels of government since the medics went on strike on December 5 last year.&ldquo;We shall unveil strategies to resume services in all facilities so that our citizens can access them. There will also be a referral mechanism for services that are not available in particular counties,&rdquo; he said.The meeting was organised by the Council of Governors last week.Last Friday, doctors' union officials were ejected from Treasury after reporting that the National Governing Council had rejected the government's latest offer to end their strike.Officials of the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Union went to the meeting for negotiations on ending the strike but the meeting lasted for only 10 minutes.[VIDEO] Doctors union officials ejected from Treasury meeting after rejecting Uhuru's offerThe union rejected the offer by the government to increase medical interns' salaries, secretary general Ouma Oluga saying they would accept nothing less than the CBA signed in 2013.Treasury CS Henry Rotich said the Doctors decision to reject the government's offer of a 40 per cent salary increase was painful and disappointing.Read:State disappointed after 'painful' rejection of deal by doctors, says CS RotichMore on this: State blames KMPDU for 'unfortunate' doctors strike
