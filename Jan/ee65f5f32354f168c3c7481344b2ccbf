The Nairobi government is likely to miss revenue targets to finance its Sh34 billion 2016-17 budget after the county assembly failed to pass a law providing for increased fees and levies.The MCAs went on recess in December without passing the Finance Bill, whose deadline was October 10.Finance executive Gregory Mwakanongo sent the Bill to the county assembly Budget and Appropriations Committee on October 5.The Public Finance Management Act gives a three-month timeline after passing the Appropriation Act, within which the Bill must be passed.The Nairobi City County Appropriations Act, which authorised the county to spend Sh34 billion, was signed into law by Governor Evans Kidero on July 10.This meant the Finance Bill must have been debated and approved by October 10.&ldquo;Not later than 90 days after passing the Appropriation Bill, the County Assembly shall consider and approve the Finance Bill with or without amendments,&rdquo; the PFM Act says.The changes proposed by Mwakanongo in the Bill aimed to ensure the county raises enough revenue to finance its budget.But failure to pass the law means City Hall will continue to charge fees and levies provided in the earlier Finance Act.According to the Bill, which is still before the Budget Committee, the county seeks to increase clamping charges from the current flat rate of Sh2,000 to Sh6,000, depending on the weight of the vehicle.Vehicles of more than 10 tonnes would pay Sh6,000.The Bill also introduces towing charges for various vehicle classes, based on where they are towed from.A vehicle less than two tonnes, for example, would cost Sh4,000 to be towed from Westlands.
