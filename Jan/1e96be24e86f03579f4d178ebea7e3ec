A man has been charged with defrauding another man of Sh70,000 with the promise of securing him a job with the Tharaka Nithi county government.Edward Murithi promised Zachary Gitonga that he would use the county speaker's influence to secure him the "lucrative" job as a clinical officer."I gave him Sh20,000 in a hotel in a hotel in Ndagani trading centre after he told me that Speaker John Mbabu had asked for it for the Public Service Board," Gitonga told a Chuka court on Monday."Two days later [Murithi's] accompliace, Gacheri Nuru, who pretended to be chief officer for Health called me and asked me to send an extra Sh30,000 because my work was to be permanent and pensionable."I was called and told I was sent to a health centre in a remote area in Tharaka constituency, which I declined and was asked to send another Sh20,000 to place me in another health facility," the complainant added.Gitonga said he realised he had been conned and that the accused had no links with the Speaker when they asked for an additional Sh30,000."I immediately reported the incident to the DCI and they managed to apprehend Gacheri at Mitheru, Maara constituency where I was to give him another Sh30,000," he said.Murithi fled to Mombasa when he learnt that his accomplice had been arrested, but he was later apprehended on New Year's Eve at his home.The court granted him a Sh50,000 cash bail or a Sh100,000 bond or surety of the same amount.Also read: Bribery, nepotism, tenders lead in county corruption
