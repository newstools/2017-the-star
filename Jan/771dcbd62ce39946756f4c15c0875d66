Impala&rsquo;s Sammy Oliech is a major doubt for the third and fourth leg of the World Sevens Series in Wellington and Sydney later this month.The utility back picked an injury during the team&rsquo;s training camp at the Peponi School, and according to team manager Eric Ogweno, he faces a race to be ready before they depart later this month.&ldquo;Oliech missed the first two legs with an hamstring injury but when he was just recovering just before Christmas, he picked up a knee injury and it&rsquo;s not looking very good,&rdquo; added Ogweno.Oliech face stiff competition to get the fly-half role from the Kabras&rsquo; Brian Tanga, who impressed in the opening two legs in Dubai and CapeTown and Augustine Lugonzo of Homeboyz.Ogweno said Homeboyz&rsquo; centre Oscar Ayodi, who missed the opening two legs of the world series is back in training alongside stalwarts Oscar Ouma and Collins Injera.He disclosed the team will not attend the training camp in South Africa as it has been cancelled but will instead, camp at the Moi International Sports Centre (MISC), Kasarani with the 12-man travelling squad expected to be named a week after.Ogweno said the areas for improvement include kick-off reception and defence coupled with strength and conditioning. He added that they have enlisted the services of Kenya 15&rsquo;s strength and conditioning coach Richard Ochieng to help the team as Ian Gibbons has other commitments in the United Kingdom. &ldquo;We are working on the kickoff reception as it was our main undoing in the two opening tournaments in Dubai and Cape Town,&rdquo; he said, adding head coach Innocent Simiyu will address the issue of kicking specialist. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not in a position to comment on that but the head coach is still looking around for the kicking coach,&rdquo; he noted. Kenya face England, Argentina and Papua New Guinea in Pool &lsquo;A&rsquo; of the Wellington tournament.Elsewhere, the 2016/17 Kenya Cup final will be played on April 22. This follows an amendment in the ongoing season&rsquo;s structure by the KRU that sees fixtures originally set for December 17, 2016 rescheduled March 25, 2017 as a result of postponements following the recent deaths of Nondies&rsquo; centre Ogeto Gecheo and Mwamba scrum-half Victor Wayodi.While releasing the amended fixtures, KRU have also introduced two breaks (25 February and April 29) to accommodate player rest and cater for any previously postponed matches. Consequently, curtains will fall on the league season on April 22 with the Enterprise competition finals being played on May 27.
