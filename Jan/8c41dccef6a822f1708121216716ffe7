Political leaders who incite Kenyans to violence should be barred from seeking elective posts, Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua has said. Mutua said leaders who use force to win an election cannot help the country achieve its development goals."Time should not be wasted investigating and arraigning such leaders in court," he said.The Maendeleo Chap Chap party leader urged youths to reject leaders who use them to gain political mileage."Some politicians are capitalising on massive youth unemployment to gain political mileage. I am urging them to shun such leaders," he said.He spoke at Kisii Agricultural Training College (ATC) where he met aspirants from Kisii, Nyamira and Migori counties.Mutua said many political parties have already identified those they will give tickets ahead of August 8 polls.He urged those interested to join his party which he noted believes in development, not empty rhetoric. "I am calling those who have interests in politics to join [Maendeleo Chap Chap] because it will be fair in conducting its affairs," he said.He added that his party advocates for peace and unity among Kenyans at a time when the county is "headed for a massive revolution".The Governor reminded leaders who are out to divide the people on tribal grounds that every Kenyan has a constitutional right to reside in any part of the country.He noted violence has negative impacts on development because it scares away investors.Read: Governor Mutua launches Maendeleo Chap Chap party ahead of 2017 bidAlso read: Mutua backs Uhuru, markets Chap Chap partyMutua was accompanied by people including Johnstone Ndege, Kisii county government secretary and head of public service, who has declared interest in the North Mugirango MP seat.
