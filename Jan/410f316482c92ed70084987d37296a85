The water crisis is getting worse by the day and tighter rationing will go into effect next week.Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company yesterday announced that the level in the Ndakaini dam has dropped to an all-time low of less than 40 per cent. It supplies more than 85 per cent the city&rsquo;s water.The drop has been caused by a prolonged drought in the Kikuyu, Aberdares and Mt Kenya, the main water catchment for rivers serving the dam.&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll release the new schedule next week because the situation is worsening by the day,&rdquo; NCWSC Corporate Affairs manager Mbaruku Vyakweli said yesterday.He said areas that have been receiving water four times a week will now only get it three times. Those getting it three times will now have it twice.Most of the residents and businesses, including five-star hotels, have turned to vendors. Slum dwellers have been the worst hit.Kibera, Kawangware, Mathare, Kwa Njenga, Kwa Reuben, Korogocho and Gomongo slums are paying as much as Sh50 for 20 litres. Residents accuse the vendors of taking advantage of the shortage to hike prices. They have also expressed doubts over the water&rsquo;s safety and fear contamination.&ldquo;There is no water in this area. People scramble for water when hawkers come,&rdquo; a Kariobangi resident said.Vyakweli said the company and police are continuing their crack down on car washes and big water wasters who defied its orders to stop the business to conserve water.&ldquo;We have arrested a number of them and the operation is on. We are warning all those still in this business to stop,&rdquo; he said.Meanwhile, the county government has started drilling 40 boreholes for Sh200 million to reduce the shortage. Governor Evans Kidero commissioned the project in Njiru on Tuesday.
