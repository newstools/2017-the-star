On April 27 last year the court permitted KBC to fence the land in Kisimani, at its own cost, after it complained of encroachment by squatters. keeping squatters outThe county government and KBC are locked in an ownership dispute.KBC, through lawyer Protus Saende, has sued Joho, county secretary Francis Thoya and Lands executive Anthony Njaramba. It wants them jailed for contempt of court.Before judge Anne Omollo, KBC argued that the three willfully and deliberately disobeyed an order issued by Justice Mohammed Ibrahim on September 25, 2012.The order restrained the old Municipal Council of Mombasa from interfering with the property pending hearing and determination of a suit.But the three said they were not given ample time to respond before the contempt orders were issued.Momanyi wants the orders issued on April 27 stayed pending hearing and determination of the main case.She said the order should have been issued upon a formal application by KBC being served to her clients and fully deliberated upon. Momanyi said KBC should have obtained planning approval from the county government, &ldquo;which is not so complicated&rdquo;. She pointed out a county rule that states &ldquo;no person shall carry out development within the area of a local authority without a development permission granted by the local authority.&rdquo;KBC wants the court to compel the respondents to pay Sh1.9 million. Saende said the county government is allowed to fence the land using any material to keep out squatters. &ldquo;Squatters are likely to invade any open land they see,&rdquo; he said.Momanyi said she had no objection but needs a week to consult her clients. The judge said the matter will be mentioned on February 6.
