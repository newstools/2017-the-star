Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula has urged the Luhyas to sign up to vote in large numbers to kick out the Jubilee government.The Bungoma senator said that despite the community&rsquo;s numerical strength, many members have not registered to vote &mdash; but they keep politicking. &ldquo;Know that this is no time to engage in politics but to mobilise and advise our people to register as voters,&rdquo; he said.Wetang&rsquo;ula said the easiest way Luhyas can end the Jubilee regime &mdash; &ldquo;which has made life unbearable for Kenyans&rdquo; &mdash; is by using their numbers. &ldquo;If you want to change the leadership by voting for the opposition, go and register and have your weapon &mdash; the voter&rsquo;s card &mdash; ready,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said.Wetang&rsquo;ula urged Western residents to take advantage of the IEBC registration so they can elect leaders who won&rsquo;t disappoint them.He was addressing a press conference at his home in Kanduyi on Friday. Wetang&rsquo;ula was accompanied by MP Wafula Wamunyinyi.&ldquo;If you visit other regions, especially in Rift Valley and Central, you will realise there&rsquo;s a lot of development. It has been brought about by leaders who have the people&rsquo;s interests at heart,&rdquo; Wetang&rsquo;ula said.&ldquo;We were recently with Wiper leader Musyoka Kalonzo in Wajir. We saw the BVR kits work properly in a desert-like area,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;I congratulate the new IEBC team led by Wafula Chebukati. Let them bring about change at the IEBC from this registration until Election Day.&rdquo;Wetang&rsquo;ula urged the electoral body to extend the registration period in areas where BVR kits have not been working properly to ensure no eligible voter is disenfranchised.
