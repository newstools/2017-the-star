KCB women volleyball team has kicked off the national trials as they seek to bolster the squad ahead of new season. More than 30 players reported for the trials yesterday envisaging to be enlisted in the squad. The bankers will be targeting to recruit at least five new players in the five-day exercise at the Railway club.KCB head coach Vernon Khayinga said the move will seek to increase their commercial dominance in the volleyball league.&ldquo; The overall performance last season was fair and we finished third in the league. We hope to offer stiff competition to our rivals since most of the young players have matured and are ready for the big stage,&rdquo; said Khayinga.The Bankers are keen on strengthening attacking and back court defence to challenge for major trophies this season. Height and basic volleyball technique are the only requirements for the new recruits, according to the coach. Team captain Eunice Maiyo, who master minded the 3-0 victory over Pipeline last season, said the bankers will seek to extend their national dominance. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great chance for new players to fulfil their dreams at KCB and I believe we will be a force to reckon with this season,&rdquo; said Maiyo. The five players will join last season&rsquo;s signings of Doreen Marani, Christine Psiwa and Fosca Kasisi. Players from all over the country are invited for the trials every day from 8am at the Nairobi Railway Club grounds.
