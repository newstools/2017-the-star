Mary Hill Girls&rsquo; High School, Thika, posted an improved performance in last year&rsquo;s KCSE exam in which many schools known for excellence performed dismally.Nationally, only 141 candidates had mean-grades of A. The results were described by many as a shocker, thanks to new rules initiated by Education CS Fred Matiang&rsquo;i .In Mary Hill, only four out of 295 candidates failed to get C-plus, the minimum university entry grade. This is a 98.5 per cent transition. Like last year, four candidates have A-plain grades, while the A-minus score increased from 59 to 66 and the B-plus score increased from 87 to 92.Speaking at the school on Friday, deputy principal in charge of academics Rosylene Wakiama said the school does not rely on leaks. She attributed the improved performance to team efforts and hard work by teachers and students.
