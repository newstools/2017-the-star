A Ukranian man was on Tuesday sentenced to four months in jail or ordered to pay a fine of Sh25,000 for refusing to take an alcoblow test.Karpuk Leugen admitted to refusing to blow into a breathalyser when he was asked to by NTSA officials.He committed the offence last Saturday.The prosecution said Leugen was driving on Thika superhighway when NTSA officials stopped him on suspicion of driving while drunk.The officials asked Leugen to blow into a breathalyser in order to measure alcohol content in his body but he refused, saying it had been used by many motorists.Police said he demanded for a new and clean breathalyser, which officials were unable to produce.Attempts to persuade him to undertake the test failed, prompting his arrest.Makadara senior resident magistrate William Oketch issued the sentence and fine after Leugen pleaded guilty to the offences."The thing the officers asked me to use looked so dirty," Leugen said during mitigation."I ordered that a new one be given to me but I was not given," he added.Read: Bar owner wants court to declare law allowing alcoblow null and void
