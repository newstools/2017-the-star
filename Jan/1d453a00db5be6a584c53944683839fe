Kirinyaga Central MP and governor hopeful Joseph Gitari yesterday said he will make a better county chief than Joseph Ndathi, whom he accused of letting down residents.He said Ndathi has failed to account for Sh20 billion the county has received from the national government in four years. But Ndathi dismissed Gitari, saying the MP is in the national government and should not allege the county has not accounted for the funds. Gitari said,&ldquo;The health sector in Kirinyaga is in ICU, yet the county government is doing nothing about it.&rdquo; But Ndathi told the Star on the phone that Kirinyaga&rsquo;s health sector is ranked among the best. In July last year, when First Lady Margaret Kenyatta handed over a Beyond Zero mobile clinic, she praised his administration for improving health, he said.But last year patients who were admitted at the Kerugoya Level 5 Hospital were forced to carry their own blankets and water. No roadsGitari said counties such as Embu and Garrisa have tarmacked roads, but Kirinyaga has not built even &ldquo;an inch&rdquo; of road. This year, the county assembly allocated Sh400 million to the governor&rsquo;s office for road repairs.But Ndathi said roads is a national government function.Gitari, who on Friday announced he will run for Kirinyaga governor, has been a vocal critic of Ndathi.He is said to have the support of Former Finance minister Njeru Githae, who lost in the TNA primaries in the 2013 election. Githae is a close ally of President Uhuru Kenyatta and is currently Kenya&rsquo;s Ambassador to the US.The governor race has attracted four hopefuls &ndash; former Devolution CS Anne Waiguru, Narc Kenya leader Martha Karua, businessmen Murithi Kagai and Eliud Wanjao.
