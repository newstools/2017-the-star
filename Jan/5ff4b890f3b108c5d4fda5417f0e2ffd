Kenyans should reject leaders who want to divide them along tribal lines, President Uhuru Kenyatta.He said the Jubilee Party, unlike the opposition, is determined to unite all Kenyans irrespective of their religion, race and political affiliation.&ldquo;Our opponents are interested in confrontational politics devoid of any development agenda for the country. We don&rsquo;t want to go back to that kind of politics that only serves the interests of a few,&rdquo; the President said.He spoke in Garissa town when he opened a JP office and urged residents to register to vote. Uhuru said that only way to sustain the development agenda and unity among Kenyans is to vote back the Jubilee administration.&ldquo;For the first time since Independence, Garissa residents are enjoying electricity from the national grid, free maternity services and candidates are not paying for national exams. Our interest is to uplift the standards of ordinary Kenyans,&rdquo; he said.Uhuru urged Kenyans to remain united during the election.He praised Garissa residents for helping to maintain security by working with security agents and elected leaders.&ldquo;Prosperity can only flourish in a peaceful environment and unity. These are the driving factors of development that Kenyans need to hold dear,&rdquo; the President said.Uhuru and DP William Ruto are touring the country to urge Kenyans to register as voters ahead of the August 8 polls. The opposition is equally doing the same.
