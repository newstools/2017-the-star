The Kilifi County Government is in the process of expanding the annual Kilifi dhow race into a regional event, county secretary Owen Baya has said.The event, which takes place on every December 31st features dhow, canoe catamaran races and swimming competition.Speaking during the event at the Kilifi Old ferry on Saturday, Baya said the county is sourcing for partners to sponsor the event that will attract participants from across East and Central Africa countries. The competition was started in 2006 by fishermen and boat owners in Kilifi town and featured participants from the nearby areas.The race, which usually takes place at the Kilifi Creek was sponsored by Safaricom between 2010 and 2014. Kilifi dhow race chairman, Mohamed Imam, said after the withdrawal of Safaricom, the number of contestants reduced drastically.&ldquo;After we lost our main sponsor, we couldn&rsquo;t hold the event and we had to look for other alternatives. We approached the area MP and he gave us some money and for the last two years, the county government has been sponsoring the event. Our budget was Sh600,000 but we now get only Sh250,000. We have had to slash the cash prize from Sh30,000 to Sh15,000 to the keep the event going,&rdquo; said Imam. The event is used to sensitize fishermen on sea safety and a celebration of the Swahili culture.The county secretary said the event will be used as a tourist attraction event. &ldquo;We want to make it bigger than the Lamu cultural festivals. We have a lot of untapped talents and cultures that would market Kilifi as the destination of choice,&rdquo; said Baya. The just concluded event attracted 17 catamarans, 31 canoes and two dhows took part. Ten swimmers in both junior and senior categories also took part.
