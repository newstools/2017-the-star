Oil majors could be in a unique position to protect their interests against a Republican proposal to tax imports, given that US President-elect Donald Trump&rsquo;s cabinet is studded with oil champions sensitive to the risk of higher gasoline prices. Big Oil is a name used to describe the world&rsquo;s seven or eight largest publicly owned oil and gas companies. Trump&rsquo;s emerging leadership includes Exxon Mobil Corp chief executive officer Rex Tillerson as secretary of state, former Texas Governor Rick Perry as energy secretary and Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt as Environmental Protection Agency administrator. Trump has made no secret of his support for the energy sector. And in Congress, Republicans and Democrats have industry ties, including House tax panel chairman Kevin Brady, a Texas Republican whose district takes in the northern Houston suburbs. House Republicans want to adopt a sweeping tax reform that will sharply reduce tax rates for corporations and end the taxation of US corporate overseas profits. But a provision known as border adjustability is stirring up controversy. Though intended to boost US manufacturing by exempting export revenues from tax, the provision worries some industries because it will also tax imports. Because US oil refiners import about half the crude oil they use to make gasoline, diesel and other products, analysts say the change could lead to higher gasoline prices and potentially undermine economic growth. Integrated oil companies such as Exxon, Chevron Corp, BP Plc, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and ConocoPhillips could be hit, depending on whether they are net importers.
