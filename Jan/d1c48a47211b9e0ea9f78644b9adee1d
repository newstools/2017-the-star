I spent my early childhood years in a housing estate in Nairobi where every one of us had a nickname. Not even best friends knew each other&rsquo;s real names. My nickname, for instance, was Okuyo, derived from my second name Gakuya, I think.Then there was a guy known as Sto, whose real name was Christopher. There was a Gitish for Gitau, King for Kingori, Ona for Njuguna, and I remember a particularly skinny girl fond of running known as Kilo, named after a ballpoint pen whose brand name was Kilometric. To this day, I have no idea what the girl&rsquo;s real name was.As children, we were, of course, unaware of the impact this nicknaming would have on us. For one thing, we didn&rsquo;t foresee the embarrassment it would cause years later when you met someone you grew up with, but couldn&rsquo;t introduce them to the company you were with presently because you didn&rsquo;t know their real name.We were also unaware that these nicknames we gave each other at such an impressionable age inoculated us against tribalism.You see, unlike many people we met later on in life when we went out to the world, we didn&rsquo;t grow up with any idea of tribe, or that people were somehow different from one another. We played the same games. We all spoke sheng. And with the possible exception of our parents or relatives, no adult spoke to us in any language other than English or Kiswahili. As for the nicknames, they said absolutely nothing about tribal backgrounds. We were Okuyo, Sto, King, and a girl named after a ballpoint pen because she physically resembled one. The nicknames, the fact that we were mini-cosmopolites, there&rsquo;s something here that should be looked into by the National Cohesion and Integration Commission, whose task it is to turn Kenya into a peaceful, united, harmonious and integrated society. And that something is how through nicknames and speaking only in tongues everyone could understand, we, unknowingly of course, avoided engaging in &ldquo;Othering&rdquo;.
