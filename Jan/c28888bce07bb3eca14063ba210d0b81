Chief Justice David Maraga is right to call for the de-congestion of prisons and pretrial police cells, which are full to overflowing with young petty offenders. The Kenya Criminal Justice System Audit Report, which Maraga yesterday launched, shows that 75 per cent of pretrial detainees in prisons are aged between 18 and 35 years.What&rsquo;s more, 70 per cent of cases are offences relating to lack of business licenses, being drunk and disorderly and creating a disturbance.Kenya has a prisons capacity of 26,757 and 55,000 inmates, almost 500 of whom are children. There are thousands of Kenyans who find themselves in the police cells for such meaningless offences as loitering with intent and being a nuisance.There is also evidence of corrupt policing: 64 percent of pretrial detainees in police cells are released without any record of being set free, even in the Occurrence Book.Corrupt cops can make a killing by taking, say, Sh1,000 per young person they release from the cells 24/7 all year long.
