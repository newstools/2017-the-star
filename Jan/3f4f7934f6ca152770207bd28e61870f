ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi yesterday criticised the National Assembly for overlooking public input when amending the election laws.He said the amendments are meant to protect the executive as it rigs the coming elections.&ldquo;The Constitution gives citizens the unique opportunity to inform and influence the legislative process by making submissions on all pertinent issues,&rdquo; Mudavadi said.He said the country is looking forward to credible elections and the opposition will work hard to ensure the will of Kenyans is achieved.Mudavadi supported today&rsquo;s opposition parties&rsquo; meeting to strategise on defeating Jubilee.Speaking at the party headquarters after an NEC meeting, Musalia said the meeting will bring together all communities to form the next government.During the NEC meeting, the party endorsed former Agriculture minister Kipruto Kirwa as ANC deputy leader.The party received aspirants who defected from ODM and other parties.&ldquo;I am happy a united opposition will be meeting for the first time after much planning to rebuild our country and ensure it remains united,&rdquo; Mudavadi said.He said he expects the meeting to create a platform for the opposition to work closely with civil society groups, religious organisations, trade unions, professionals and other stakeholders to form the new government under the proposed National Super Alliance.&ldquo;We trust in Kenyans to put aside other interests and vote wisely so that after five years, Kenya, which is our home, is great again,&rdquo; he said.The former Deputy Prime Minister said the opposition will also discuss the Election Laws (Amendment) Act, 2016.
