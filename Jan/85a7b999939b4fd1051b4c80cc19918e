The Migori government has asked the state and aid agencies to give Nyatike and Uriri subcounties residents relief food. Water executive Isca Oluoch on Wednesday said they are identifying the worst-hit areas. She said the government will buy emaciated animals from farmers. Oluoch said the county government is encouraging farmers to plant drought-resistant crops such as cassava and early maturing crops. On Monday, families in North Kanyamkago ward said they have been forced to move their animals to other parts of the county due to the drought. &ldquo;I lost three animals in two weeks as watering points dried up,&rdquo; resident Joseph Okal said. Meanwhile, some people living with HIV-Aids have stopped using life-prolonging ARVs due to lack of a balanced diet. They have urged the government to give them supplements. Isaiah Nyang&rsquo;otho, who runs a group of those taking the drugs in Nyatike, said they have been severely affected by the drought. ARVs should not be taken on an empty stomach.
