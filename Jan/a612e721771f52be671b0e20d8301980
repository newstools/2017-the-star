We told him to do so as grassroots officials of the party."He addressed the press on Thursday accompanied by with Uasin Gishu branch chairman David Chepsiror and 13 other officials from North Rift counties.Kibet said Kanu members were Kenyans affected by mismanagement by the jubilee government. &ldquo;When we go for the NDC of the party we will endorse the decision taken by Salat at Bomas of Kenya," he said.He added that the party would also reach a consensus on the matter and agree to join NASA. Chepsiror said there was no need for some Kanu leaders to insist on being part of Jubilee Party yet Deputy President William Ruto and National Assembly Majority leader Adan Dwale had made it clear the party was not wanted.&ldquo;Jubilee leaders have been talking ill of Kanu and its leaders. There is no need for us to pretend that we are part of a group when we are not welcome,"said Kibet. The Kanu officials said they would host public forums in their region to inform members on why it was necessary for them to support NASA.They accused Duale of poking into Rift Valley politics, in a show of disrespect for the region's leaders. &ldquo;Let him deal with more serious natters in Northeastern because we have our leaders here in Rift Valley," he said.Duale said Kanu will not win any seats in the region in the August polls.More on this: Carry Ruto on your back like your father was carried, Duale tells Gideon Moi
