Election fever gripped the House on Tuesday on the first day of the last lap of the eleventh Parliament.The National Assembly resumed from a month-long recess, with MPs calling for peaceful campaigns ahead of the August 8 general election amid fears of quorum hitches.On the first day, usually reserved for the approval of the key House Business Committee, which sets and schedules agenda for the House, lawmakers were equivocal for tranquility in lead up to the elections.Others like minority Whip Thomas Mwadeghu (Wundanyi) and Nominated MP Johnson Sakaja informed their colleagues that they seek to be governors in Taita Taveta and Nairobi counties respectively.&ldquo;There are those who will not come on purpose, but there are others who will not come by the will of the people. As we move towards election, let us not raise political tensions as we have seen across the country. Let us remember that at the end of the day, we are all one country,&rdquo; Sakaja said.Mwadeghu said records show in every election cycle, only around 20 per cent of MPs come back to the House.&ldquo;As many as 80 per cent of us will not be here. I wish you well for those who will make it here, but for me, I am going to seek a higher office,&rdquo; he said. Olago Aluoch (Kisumu West) warned his colleagues that 70 per cent of them will not come back to Parliament, citing misuse of CDF cash as a key reason for the trend. He used the opportunity to drum support for his own re-election, arguing his constituency was ranked among the best in the use of CDF.&ldquo;As we approach this session, we must be aware of the need to educate Kenyans to vote and to vote wisely. Those who talk the loudest are the ones whose constituencies lag behind in voter registration," Aluoch said.Dan Maanzo (Makueni) said,&ldquo;Quorum hitches are likely to be experienced in the remaining period. For those seeking higher seats, live your dreams and let those coming back be blessed.&rdquo;Bobasi MP Stephen Manoti urged his colleagues to be ambassadors of peace during campaigns to ensure the country does not slide back to anarchy.&ldquo;It is our duty to make sure peace prevails all over to avoid the 2007-08 post-election violence, which was caused by the loose mouths of politicians,&rdquo; he said.Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi warned the executive against trying to bypass the House in budget-making "as is often the case during an election year&rdquo;.&ldquo;This House is the only institution with sole mandate to determine the budget, unfortunate that the executive through the treasury wants to arm-twist this House by asking officers not to appear before committee,&rdquo; he said.
