Delay in court cases leads to litigants corrupting judges and magistrates, the president of the Court of Appeal, Kariuki Kihara, has said.He said people who have no guarantee of finding expeditious closure in their disputes seek shortcuts for a favourable judgment.In a paper he presented during the launch of Chief Justice David Maraga&rsquo;s blueprint, Kihara said the Judiciary&rsquo;s reputation for corruption encourages unduly prolonged cases and judicial officers getting kickbacks from litigants. &ldquo;We must apply ourselves to the urgent need to increase the speed with which cases are filed, heard and determined,&rdquo; he said. The judge said to rein in corruption, the Judiciary must embrace Information Communication Technology. &ldquo;Properly used, ICT can transform the speed and style in which we work,&rdquo; Kihara said.He said ICT can secure public records and provide a valuable reference point that guarantees the accountability of every judicial officer.Kihara questioned why litigants queue at the Judiciary for months waiting for rulings. &ldquo;The need for justice that is timely, knowledge-based and accurate is urgent, it is the anchor that secures our democracy by providing the oil that guarantees the smooth turning of the wheels of our Constitution,&rdquo; he said.
