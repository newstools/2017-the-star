Uncontrolled sand scooping in river Athi is slowly turning the river into a mere route of contaminated water from Nairobi all the way to the Indian Ocean, yatta MP Francis Mwangangi has said.Mwangangi has said that due to the haphazard exercise concentrated in parts of Mwala and Yatta, the river has been left with no sand to sieve the already contaminated water.&ldquo;This sand used to help sieve the raw effluent deposited in this river by some big companies Nairobi but when you look at the water now it has remained green all through meaning that the toxins are finding their way all the way from Nairobi downstream&rdquo;, said Mwangangi.He asked the National Environment Management Authority to move in and ensure controlled sand harvesting in the river as some parts of the river needed a total ban on the exercise.
