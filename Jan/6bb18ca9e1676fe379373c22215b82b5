Ford Kenya has called for equal sharing of governor and senator seats in Mombasa to avoid disagreements within the opposition. National secretary general Yasser Bajaber (pictured) said if Cord co-principals Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper), Raila Odinga (ODM) and Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula (Ford Kenya) negotiate and agree, it would be easy to defeat Jubilee in Mombasa.Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho, Senator Hassan Omar and Nyali MP Hezron Awiti will vie for the county&rsquo;s top seat, yet they all belong to Cord.&ldquo;We agreed that Ford Kenya will field the Senate candidate. If we want to win as a coalition, we need to negotiate as a family and field a stronger candidate for governor. If we fight amongst ourselves, then Jubilee will defeat us,&rdquo; he said.Bajaber was addressing Ford Kenya delegates at Freretown Hall in Mombasa.
