The Jubilee Party had been courting Mombasa Deputy Governor Hazel Katana for a year and the decision to defect from ODM was sealed after she met President Uhuru Kenyatta at State House Mombasa early this month, the Star has learnt.Nominated Senator Emma Mbura was tasked with convincing her to leave ODM. &ldquo;She wanted to quit long ago but she is someone with respect and did not want to cause problems so she stayed put,&rdquo; she told the Star.On Saturday, Katana said she was disrespected and not trusted in ODM, which sowed the seeds of Jubilee in her heart. &ldquo;I was called stupid, worthless and valueless. Now I have found a voice,&rdquo; she said in Mombasa.Joho was combativeKatana&rsquo;s associates said the combative nature of Governor Hassan Joho&rsquo;s politics played a role in her quitting ODM.They said Katana is a timid leader who does not like confrontation.Uhuru assured Katana of his full support and other incentives, the Star has learnt. It is not clear what the incentives were.Brown envelop, but no moneyOn Saturday, Mbura said Katana was not offered any money to decamp.&ldquo;People want to say Hazel was offered a brown envelop. Yes, she was offered a brown envelop of development, peace and love,&rdquo; she said.Katana was temporarily ejected from her office during last year&rsquo;s March 7 Malindi by-election campaigns after she was accused by the ODM leadership in Mombasa of campaigning for Jubilee. Her official car was withdrawn and her office furniture taken away, but they were later returned.Mombasa county denied she was ejected from her office and that her official car was withdrawn.Professor Rocha Chimerah of Pwani University yesterday said Katana&rsquo;s defection has no impact.&ldquo;Her selection [as running mate] was for political populism. She was a Mijikenda and woman, the perfect combination. She will take nothing to Jubilee, not as a woman or a Mijikenda,&rdquo; he said on the phone.Blow to JohoHowever, University of Nairobi don Philip Kaulu and political analyst Mwakuja Mrombo said her defection is a blow to Joho as it ruins his image.The governor has put on a brave face over the matter, with his spokesman Richard Chacha terming the defection &ldquo;good riddance&rdquo;.But Kaulu and Mrombo say Katana&rsquo;s defection paints a picture Joho cannot work with women and the Mijikenda are not in government.
