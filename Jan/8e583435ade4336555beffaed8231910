Low-cost airline Jambojet has leased a new aircraft to address delays like the ones experienced during the Christmas holidays. The 78-seater Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 from Abu Dhabi Aviation will replace one of Jambojet&rsquo;s aging two Q400 aircrafts.&ldquo;We selected the Q400 aircraft because it has the speed and range required to service all our current domestic destinations and targeted regional destinations. It has proven to be the right aircraft for this market,&rdquo; Jambojet chief executive Willem Hondius said.The new aircraft is expected to begin operations as soon as the airline receives approval from the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority.Jambojet is believed to have cost hoteliers millions of shillings in December after the carrier experienced delays and re-routing due to unexpected technical challenges which saw passengers headed for Ukunda and Malindi stranded at the Moi International Airport in Mombasa.
