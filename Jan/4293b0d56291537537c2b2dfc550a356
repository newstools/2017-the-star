Kenya Sevens will face Fiji today in a friendly match at St. Joseph College in Sydney ahead of the fourth leg of the World Sevens Series this weekend.Team manager, Eric Ogweno, said the match against the Olympic champions will be used to asses their systems and structures after a lukewarm performance in Wellington Sevens, where they garnered eight points by winning the bowl category.&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t play well against Argentina and England in the pool matches and we were guilty of self inflicted mistakes which saw us conceding tries. This is one area we have to rectify before the weekend,&rdquo; added Ogweno.Kenya have been drawn in arguably their toughest pool so far as they face series leaders and Wellington champions South Africa, England and Japan in Pool &lsquo;A&rsquo;. However, Ogweno is not worried about facing the two big sides in the pool.&ldquo;This are teams we have beaten before so the boys have to show resolve, play intelligently and execute better in attack and defence,&rdquo; he added. Other areas of concern will be the kickoff, reception and defence. &ldquo;We have to work on the kick-off reception and our tackling technique which will aid in our defence,&rdquo; added Ogweno.He said the squad have will also have to improve on their accuracy in possession. &ldquo;Our passing has to be sharper and we must maintain the ball for longer periods in order to penetrate opposition defences,&rdquo; he added.The team had a gym session yesterday and were in high spirits ahead of tough two-days at sold out Allianz Arena.Skipper Andrew Amonde is equally optimistic of a good performance against the powerhouses South Africa and England.&ldquo;The world series is competitive and tournaments are not the same. I think we may be in for some surprises come the weekend,&rdquo; added Amonde.In three meetings with South Africa last year, Kenya won once beating the Blitzbokke 14-12 in Cape Town and losing 26-19 in Sydney and 14-0 in Singapore.They will have to keep an eye on speedster Seabelo Senatla, play-maker Roscko Specman and bruising forwards Werner Kok and Chris Dry. Kenya are yet to register a win against England in several seasons with the former colonial master toying with Shujaa last weekend in Wellington, where they won 31-12 .In Wellington, Kenya also lost to Argentina 17-12 and recovered to beat Papua New Guinea 47-5 to be relegated to the bowl category, where they beat Russia 24-5, USA 19-12 and Australia 19-17 to win the title.
