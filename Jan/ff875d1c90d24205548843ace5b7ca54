Olympic steeplechase champion Conseslus Kipruto clocked 32:27 to place third on a cold and dry afternoon at the Cross Internacional Juan Muguerza in Elgoibar on Sunday.Uganda&rsquo;s Joshua Cheptegei scored another noteworthy victory with the World Cross Country championships just over two months away in his home town of Kampala.Cheptegei is almost certainly the host nation&rsquo;s best hope for an individual senior medal at world x-country in March having won the Ugandan Trials last weekend.After breaking up the pack with 18 minutes on the clock, Cheptegei made his decisive move in the eighth kilometre to move clear of reigning champion Aweke Ayalew from Bahrain and former winner Teklemariam Medhin from Eritrea.Cheptegei built up a commanding margin in the last quarter of the senior men&rsquo;s 10.8km contest, crossing the finish line in 31:50 and some 26 seconds ahead of Ayalew. In doing so, Cheptegei became just the second Ugandan winner in race history after Timothy Toroitich in 2014. Medhin was fourth in 32:28 while Javier Guerra was the top domestic finisher in fifth (32:31) .In the women&rsquo;s race, world 5000m silver medallist Senbere Teferi defeated Olympic champion and world steeplechase record-holder Ruth Jebet for the second time in as many weekends.Teferi, who also claimed a silver medal at the IAAF World Cross Country Championships Guiyang 2015, defeated Jebet by 13 seconds in Seville last weekend and the Ethiopian enjoyed a similar margin of ascendency this weekend, covering the 7.6km course in 25:18 to defeat Jebet by 12 seconds. Trihas Gebre was the best of the Spaniards again, finishing third in 25:37.
