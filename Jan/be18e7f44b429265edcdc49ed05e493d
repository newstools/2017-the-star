Kiambu woman representative hopeful Gladys Chania on Sunday urged leaders to involve residents in resolving some of the social problems the county faces. Citing low voter registration turnout, she said leaders must come out and mobilise residents. Chania said as they move around, they will understand the problems people face on the ground. She spoke in Gatundu. &ldquo;Here in Kiambu, a polling station that registers only seven people should send a signal that there is a disconnect somewhere. As leaders, we need to deliberate on how best to take the county forward,&rdquo; Chania said. She said problems such as unemployment, alcoholism and disenfranchisement of women and persons living with disability must be looked into as the county heads to the election. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get ready to work with all people of good will, deliver our community from social ills and improve all services as time, energy and capacity will enable us to do so. We need prayers to achieve this kind of liberation. Together we can soldier on undeterred,&rdquo; Chania said. She has been mobilising residents, especially the youth and women, to come out and register to vote.
