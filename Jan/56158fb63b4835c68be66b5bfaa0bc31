Kabete MP Ferdinand Waititu has stated he will not be intimidated into abandoning his quest to be Kiambu's next governor.Waititu told Jubilee delegates at Kasarani in Nairobi on Friday that he will continue with his campaigns, despite threats from any quarter."I have said time and again that I am ready to deal with anyone, day and night, while seeking the seat," he said."For instance, we are now being told there is an ongoing registration of voters in Kiambu, meant to be used in rigging. That will not happen," he said.Read: Waititu will beat Kabogo hands down in Kiambu governor race - pollAlso read: Waititu triumphs over Kabogo in degree caseWaititu further said voters in Central will support Deputy President William Ruto's presidential bid in 2022."I have supported President Uhuru Kenyatta and Ruto from their days in Kanu when the President was elected party chairman," he said."...and as Mt Kenya we know the DP helped Uhuru clinch the presidency in 2013. After re-election we will support Ruto in his bid.

He and Waititu have long engaged in a rivalry that has seen the Governor question the MP's academic qualifications.Kabogo called for the election of the party's interim leaders who are not seeking or defending political seats."The party should work on ensuring every aspirant is confident about fair primaries and elections by not offering any slots to politicians," he said.
