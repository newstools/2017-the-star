Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya has dismissed a tweet purporting that he is planning to leave Jubilee Party and return to ODM.Mvurya decamped last September before the official launch of President Uhuru Kenyatta's Jubilee Party for which 11 affiliates folded up.It was alleged that forces within ODM had threatened to deny him a ticket in the August poll s for his refusal to be loyal to party chiefs.Read: Jubilee wins big in Coast as Mvurya ditches ODMThe tweet Mvurya allegedly wrote read: "Jubilee promised us goodies but we have been shortchanged. It is never too late to go back home for the interest of my people. Accept my apologies."The message was written on a Twitter account with his name and photo, and has been shared widely on various social media platforms.But the Governor said on Thursday that his critics were behind the message, and underlined that he was firmly in Jubilee and will support Uhuru's re-election."I will defend the Governor seat on a Jubilee ticket on August 8. The information being spread using my photo is not true," he said on his official Facebook page."I am still in Jubilee. It is a propaganda by some people," he further told the Star by phone.The Governor urged Kwale residents to register as voters during the IEBC mass listing that will end on February 14.Rodgers Chimega, the governor's personal assistant, said the Twitter account used to spread the information was not the governor's official one."The message being peddled through this photo is therefore false and is meant to portray the Governor in bad light," Chimega said.
