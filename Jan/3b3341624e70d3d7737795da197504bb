We are all set for the national league and our objective is to qualify back to the Premier League when the season comes to a wrap.&rdquo;The Mombasa-based side will come against Park road Tigers, Karate Axiom, Daystar University and Jomo Kenyatta University Agriculture Technology among other teams.However, information on whether their female counterpart and Mvita will return to the league remain scanty.Elsewhere, Mombasa West men&rsquo;s hockey team plans to make a debut in the KHU national league are in top gear. The side, under the tutelage of Julius Matero, have so far send a list of 19 players, to KHU secretariat.Matero, however, said they are reaching out to the sponsors as they are yet to clear with the union on certain requirements which entails finances.&ldquo;I think the good news is that we have a team which is currently training and ready to make a debut in the league. But at the same time, we are short of finances and that&rsquo;s why we are reaching out to sponsors and people of good will to come forth and help as make the dreams of these players to feature in the league a reality,&rdquo; said Matero.
