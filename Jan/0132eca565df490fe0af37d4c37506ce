Police have been accused of torching the houses of 10 families in Malalani village in Kwale County on Thursday morning. The families accused Diani police officers for being used by the female developer to destroy their housesat around 4:00 am.Salim Chilungu, one of the victims, said they were allocated each five acres of land in 1977 by the government. &ldquo;Last year she just came from nowhere and torched our four houses. It really pains me that as it happens no leader has come forward to fight for us,&rdquo; he said.Chilungu explained that few years ago when they went to search for their title deeds, they were told to wait a little bit but later on found out that the land was bearing other peoples&rsquo; names.Saumu Hamisi could not control her emotions as she explained what transpired in the wee hours.&ldquo;Police and a certain woman came here at around 4 am in the morning. They broke our house, burnt it and went ahead to cut all the trees in the farm,&rdquo; she said.She said that during the incident she also lost clothes and school uniforms for her children.Saumu noted that although the incident has happened twice, this time it was severe as they have also lost their cattle.&ldquo;My cattle have also gone. I have stayed here for around fifty years cultivating this land. We are told the woman bought the plot but it is good if she could have come to talk to us instead of using police to forcefully get us out of here,&rdquo; she added.Salim Kururushi said the family has really been harassed for long and asked the concerned people to intervene before matter gets worse.Effort to reach area police boss Patrick Oduma were futile as his phone went unanswered.Read; West Pokot residents accuse police of burning their houses in land rowOut
