Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho is a &ldquo;political conman full of retrogressive thinking&rdquo; and is keen to discredit state projects for undeserved political mileage, the government spokesperson has said.Eric Kiraithe said the state exercises authority and legitimacy not to sound tough, but to improve citizens lives.Kiraithe said Joho&rsquo;s arguments and bashing of Coast projects by the state are myopic.Last week Joho and Kilifi Governor Amazon Kingi said the Jubilee government is taking credit for projects started by Coast counties and funded by the World Bank and other donors.It was an embarrassment during President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s commissioning last week of the Buxton Footbridge and the Bamburi storm water drainage system.Kiraithe said the government is on course to achieve Vision 2030, which could have remained a dream if it were not for Jubilee.&ldquo;I pity citizens of a county whose governor would come and introduce a new project in the name of &lsquo;my&rsquo; project,&rdquo; Kiraithe said.Speaking in Mombasa on Thursday, he criticised Joho for discrediting Jubilee projects meant to make Kenyans &ldquo;wealthy&rdquo;.Kiraithe said most government projects were started after Independence and successive administrations have carried on with the work.He said the thinking that one political side should determine the development projects to be implemented is unfortunate and should becondemned by everyone of good will. &ldquo;On election day, they [electorate] should be keen to single out people who have their own political survival in mind when they distribute publicresources,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The idea that a leader or government should start a project for attribution [to themselves] is myopic, unfortunate and reduces the exercise ofstate authority to a personal whim.&rdquo;
