Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho has said his county faces possible sabotage by &ldquo;mysterious elements&rdquo; during the August 8 general election.He said these saboteurs have been bribed to misdirect voters, especially those in Likoni. Joho on Monday said Jubilee is part of the plan.He said Jubilee is hoodwinking Likoni residents to register or transfer votes to other constituencies.Joho said the conspiracy will create a scenario in which Likoni will be left with room for vote tampering during the election. He spoke in Treasury Square, Mombasa. Joho said the plan by Jubilee is to ground ferry services during the general election so that the Likoni voters will be unable to cross and vote. From Likoni, other subcounties can quickly be accessed via the Likoni Channel Crossing.Joho said 300,000 voters are eligible to be registered in the county, differing sharply with the IEBC&rsquo;s projected 195,000 target. He also dismissed Deputy President William Ruto&rsquo;s remarks that the opposition is &ldquo;clueless&rdquo;. Joho said it is the difficulties the government has put Kenyans through that have rendered their very administration &ldquo;clueless&rdquo;.Early this month, the Mombasa governor said the county was a Cord zone. He said he will continue to sell the opposition&rsquo;s agenda, whether or not Jubilee allocates funds for projects. He also dismissed reports the government has pumped a lot of money into the Buxton Footbridge. Joho said the money for the bridge was donated by the World Bank. &ldquo;I know the history of this project. It started in 2010,&rdquo; he said.On Monday, Jomvu MP Badi Twalib also said the deputy county commissioners should be given permission to take charge of the more than 18,000 uncollected ID cards in Mombasa. &ldquo;Instead of piling up those IDs at Huduma Centres, the deputy county commissioners should take charge of the uncollected IDs to make collection easier,&rdquo; he said.
