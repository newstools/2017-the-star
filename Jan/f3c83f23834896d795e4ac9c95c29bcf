Meru governor Peter Munya has hit back at Senator Kiraitu Murungi over his remarks that Munya&rsquo;s PNU party is like &lsquo;a goat waiting to be slaughtered during the August 8 elections&rsquo;. &ldquo;We are tired of his nonsense as its useless value,&rdquo; Munya said.Read: Kiraitu, Munya trade accusations over failed Jamhuri Day fete&ldquo;Tutaonana na ndugu wengine wale tunatafuta viti ya governor lakini msiwe na wasi wasi. Kuna mbuzi ingine inatembea huko inaitwa PNU lakini msijali, itachinjwa mwezi wa August 2017,&rdquo;&ldquo;We will meet with some of our brothers who are also seeking the governor&rsquo;s seat but don&rsquo;t be scared. There is a goat wandering out there called PNU, we will slaughter it in August 2017,&rdquo; Kiraitu had said on Friday during Jubilee&rsquo;s launch of a digital membership card at the Kasarani stadium. The remarks however rubbed Munya the wrong way and he on Saturday responded by dismissing Kiraitu&rsquo;s confidence of defeating him at the ballot. &ldquo;His retirement days are here. His politics are so old age he needs to go home. He has been in leadership for 35 years, ten of which he was a cabinet minister. He has no bonus (time) left other than time to spend with his children,&rdquo; Munya said on Saturday.The two politicians have been at loggerheads for a while now since Kirauti announced his plans to unseat the PNU chairman as Meru governor during the August polls.Read: Kiraitu's Entry Heats Up Meru Governor RaceMunya, who is also the Council of Governors chairman, will be defending his seat on the PNU ticket although he has declared his support for President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s re-election bid. This is seen as a well calculated move by Munya to gain support from Uhuru&rsquo;s supporters in the entire Meru region that is largely a Jubilee zone.
