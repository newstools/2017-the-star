Concerns that IEBC CEO Ezra Chiloba and chairperson nominee Wafula Chebukati cannot work concurrently for the commission because they are from the same community and county are misplaced.What matters are their experience and qualifications for these top positions.No Kenyan should lose an opportunity to serve just because a fellow tribesman or tribeswoman already has a job in the same organisation.As National Assembly Majority leader Aden Duale pointed out on Saturday, there is nowhere in the Constitution or the IEBC Act that it is provided the chairperson and CEO should not come from the same community.Ethnic balance is not an exact science; if it were, the presidency, for instance, would rotate among all 47 counties, presumably taking 235 years of one term each.For all anyone knows at this point in time, Chiloba and Chebukati could well deliver a perfectly well managed free, fair and credible General Election. And their being Luhya would have nothing to do with that outcome.
