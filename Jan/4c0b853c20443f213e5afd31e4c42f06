A section of Marakwet youths have lashed out at some Baringo leaders who recently accused Deputy President William Ruto of endorsing certain hopefuls.ODM council member Amos ole Mpaka and Kanu politician Erick Bett on Friday criticised Ruto for what they termed his meddling in the county&rsquo;s politics. Kerio Valley Youths Association chairman Joel Kimaiyo denied claims that the DP prevailed upon Betting Control and Licensing Board memberSimon Chelugui, who was seen as a front runner for Baringo governo, to change his mind and instead stand for senator.&ldquo;Let it be known that it is the same elders who told Chelugui to wait for another five years to vie for governor who urged him to consider vying for senator. The record should be set straight. It is not the DP who asked him to do so,&rdquo; Kimaiyo said. They spoke at Kapsowar on Sunday. He said it was wrong for some individuals to claim Chelugui dropped his quest for governor during a meeting at Ruto&rsquo;s Sugoi home.
