When Nigerian artiste Davido released a song titled Coolest Kid In Africa with Nasty C, nobody thought a Kenyan rapper would compose just the right reply to that song.However, a Kenyan femcee named Yviona May aka Rapa Tenn has just done that!The 20-year-old artiste has released her rendition of the song bearing the title Baddest B**ch In Africa.So why did she chose to go with such a nasty title?"I just felt like men have been rapturous always singing about how they got juice, they got sauce. So I just felt like doing something for the ladies."So, it's a song for the ladies and I know they are happy singing to Baddest B**ch In Africa," she said during an interview with Word Is.Yviona, who classifies herself as an all-round artiste who likes to experiment with her voice, terms her music style as futuristic.In 2016, she worked with rapper King Kaka on the hit song titled Thug Love.She says: "It was not my own story... It was just a song telling ladies to exercise patience, as their men go out working for them."Yviona also dared the 'beefing' Kenyan femcees to diss her."I will kill them all... My music and theirs is not in the same lane... It's all about positive energy," she says.&nbsp;&nbsp;
