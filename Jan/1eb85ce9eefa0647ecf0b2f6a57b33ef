Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka is our undisputed political kingpin, support his presidential ambition, Kitui Senate hopeful Enock Wambua has urged the Kamba community.&ldquo;I announce to all Kambas of Kitui, Machakos and Makueni counties that the Ukambani political kingpin is Kalonzo. We should thus not be convinced otherwise. That position is not negotiable,&rdquo; he said.Wambua, who quit his plum job as Managing Editor of the Standard Group&rsquo;s weekend editions, said the community must stand firm behind Kalonzo and resist all attempts by naysayers to antagonise him.&ldquo;Just as Raila Odinga is the cherished leader of the Luo, Willian Ruto the favoured head of the Kalenjin and Uhuru Kenyatta the adored Kikuyu favourite for whom they come out of hospital beds to vote, we, too, must show similar undivided zeal for our own Kalonzo,&rdquo; Wambua said.He spoke in the Kyuso grounds, Mwingi North constituency, where he organised a New Year party and a football match for the youth, as he sought to popularise his bid. Wambua urged residents to vote for him.Wambua said his first assignment if elected senator will be to advocate creation of Mwingi county from the expansive Kitui. He said Kitui, which is 30,490 square kilometres, is larger than the 26,000 sq-km Rwanda.&ldquo;I cover a far much bigger area than that covered by President Paul Kagame in his presidential campaigns,&rdquo; he said. Wambua said by landmass and population, Mwingi deserves to be a county.
