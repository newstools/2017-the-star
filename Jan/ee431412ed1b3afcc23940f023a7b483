Jubilee Party leaders in the North Rift yesterday asked Baringo Senator Gideon Moi to respect DP William Ruto if he wants to ascend to Kalenjin leadership. &ldquo;Gideon has decided to go against the wishes of the Kalenjin community, which stood by his father for 24 years. He is not the calibre of Ruto and he can&rsquo;t ascend to the community&rsquo;s leadership by trying to pull back Ruto. In fact, he is only known for bearing [President Daniel] Moi&rsquo;s surname and nothing else,&rdquo; Uasin Gishu JP chairman William Mutai said in Eldoret. North Rift youth leader Samson Cherarkei said, &ldquo;Let him first address the insecurity and development projects he has failed to initiate in his county. We respect him as a senator and he too should respect Ruto.&rdquo;
