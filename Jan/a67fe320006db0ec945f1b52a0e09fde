Six locomotives &mdash; two for passengers and four for cargo &mdash; will be offloaded at the Port of Mombasa tomorrow. They are meant for the standard gauge railway. Some 31 other passenger coaches will be among the consignment coming from China. In a statement sent to newsrooms by the Transport ministry yesterday, soft-seat coaches accommodate 72 passengers each, while hard-seat coaches can carry 118 passengers. This is the second batch of the locomotives. The first delivery was on January 11, when six arrived. Transport PS Irungu Nyakera yesterday said the arrival of these locomotives signifies the government&rsquo;s commitment to successful implementation of the SGR project. &ldquo;The Jubilee administration wants to make sure the SGR is completed in time to afford Kenyans the benefits of a functional, efficient and reliable railway transport system,&rdquo; he said.
