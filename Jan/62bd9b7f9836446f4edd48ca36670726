The Jubilee government should stop fooling Western residents by saying it will revive Pan Paper Mills because everyone knows there are no trees in the region, Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Opranya has said.The first phase of the revival started on December 15, with more than 500 people employed. &lsquo;&rsquo;When President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto came here to revive this mill, sold for a price not agreeable to Western leaders, residents asked them where they will get the raw material at a time the emphasis is on planting more trees, not cutting them down. But they did not give an answer,&rsquo;&rsquo; Oparanya said.He urged the government to come up with a tree planting programme to supply the mill with raw materials. Oparanya said most of the projects Jubilee has started in Bungoma and other parts of Western are meant to hoodwink residents into voting for it. &lsquo;&rsquo;I have been a minister for Planning and other dockets and I can tell you for free these trucks you see on our roads will have been removed by April and you will never reach those concerned until after the polls,&rsquo;&rsquo; Oparanya said.
