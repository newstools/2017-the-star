More than 100,000 residents of West Pokot county have not registered as voters as the drive enters week three, DP William Ruto said yesterday.The Deputy President urged residents to educate each other on the importance of being registered.He spoke when he toured the county to lobby residents. &ldquo;You should register as voters so that you can vote for the Jubilee Party. This government has helped improve lives and we need to vote it back,&rdquo; Ruto said.The Deputy President also directed chiefs to ensure youths aged 18 and above get IDs. He said the youth should not be denied IDs because they lack some supporting documents. &ldquo;You should not demand many documents from youths before issuing them with IDs,&rdquo; Ruto said.The DP said in the county, churches are far apart and it&rsquo;s hard for the youth to acquire baptismal cards, which are some of the documents required for an ID. &ldquo; If you know their background and parents, that&rsquo;s enough to give them IDs,&rdquo; he said.Ruto also drummed up support for the Jubilee Party and asked residents to vote for the party in the August polls.He said Jubilee has initiated many projects that have improved the economy. Ruto said the opposition has no capacity to rule, saying it has no development plans.&ldquo;How can you trust leadership of this nation to people who are fond of planning demonstrations? That&rsquo;s what they can do best,&rdquo; he said.Ruto said the Jubilee administration has improved healthcare, infrastructure and other projects that directly benefit Kenyans. &ldquo;The opposition claims that this government has looted funds. If it&rsquo;s true, could we be able to implement some of the mega projects we have funded?&rdquo; he asked.Ruto said when ODM leader Raila Odinga was in government, he was unable to account for resources. &ldquo;When he was the Prime Minister, what did they do?&rdquo; he said.On party nominations, the Deputy President assured the process will be free and fair.
