Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho met Amani leader Musalia Mudavadi on Tuesday to discuss national and regional politics, a move seen as reaching out to the Luhya spokesman for the community&rsquo;s support.ANC Coast secretary general Jimmy Azangu says the meeting was meant to show the Mulembe community in Mombasa that the governor is ready to work with them.The community has complained that they have been sidelined and denied key positions in Joho&rsquo;s administration.Azangu said Mudavadi asked the governor to take good care of the community&rsquo;s interests.&ldquo;Mudavadi is concerned over the raw deal the community was offered by the county. Despite discussing the Nasa politics, community interest also came into play,&rdquo; he told the Star.&ldquo;What the community demands is two executive slots, speaker of the county assembly and several nominated MCAs slots.&rdquo;Joho will be seeking reelection on the ODM ticket and has said he will run for President in 2022.Azangu said Joho agreed to some of demands, but he did not divulge details.County communication director Richard Chacha, however, said Mudavadi was reaching out to Joho after a public demand from those who attended his anointment on Saturday at Bukhungu Stadium, Kakamega county.&ldquo;It did not go into specifics. It was how to move together and unite under the National Super Alliance. He was seeking Joho&rsquo;s views on how Nasa can be made stronger,&rdquo; he said.Last year, the community said they might front their own candidates if contestants do not agree to a concrete pre-election pact.At the time, ANC national chairman Kelvin Lunani demanded a pact that will guarantee them the Nyali MP post, speaker of the county assembly, at least two executive jobs, and six slots for nominated MCAs.The Luhya command about 50,000 to 60,000 votes at the Coast, according to Lunani, who is heading the campaign.
