Risk management firm Warrior Insight has completed the design and installation of security system at Runda&rsquo;s Rosslyn Riviera Mall ahead of official opening.Warrior Insight chief executive Tony Sugden praised RRM developers for consulting security experts in the early stages of designing the new mall. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s incredibly important for developers to get security and risk management advice early on so that we can advise on the most effective technology and the best combination of strategic solutions for a given project right from the start,&rdquo; Sugden said. He said most of the security services that Nairobi clients seek from the firm are now outdated, time consuming for users and do not offer adequate safety. "Once the mall begins operations, WI will provide extra discreet security services, which will be manned by highly-trained guards," Sugden said.
