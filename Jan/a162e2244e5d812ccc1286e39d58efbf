An American NGO has constructed a 300,000 litre water tank for Kari Primary School in Kiharu constituency to save the pupils the four hours a week they use to fetch water from a river.It cost Sh800,000.In October last year, the pupils walked five kilometres to raise money for a water tank. They walked from Kahuro shopping centre to their school to mobilise the local community to help them in constructing a water tank.The more than 400 pupils will now have a continuous supply of water after Can-Do-Kids NGO.Head teacher George Mureithi on Saturday said the pupils were spending at least two hours two days a week fetching water from the river to clean their classrooms.&ldquo;Two hours are too much to be lost in search of water and I am glad the pupils will be able to save the time for studies,&rdquo; the charity group&rsquo;s patron Karanja Mburu said.He said well-wishers from the USA contributed towards the construction of the tank.Water is a vital commodity that is necessary in schools as lack of it hurts children&rsquo;s health and causes their academic performance to deteriorate, Mburu said.He said the group has used almost Sh8 million to build eight other tanks in primary schools in the area.It will continue to source for funds to build 100 more tanks so that all primary schools in the constituency have access to clean drinking water, Mburu said.&ldquo;These tanks will help the schools to tap rain water and conserve it for use throughout the year,&rdquo; he said.Murang&rsquo;a woman representative Sabina Chege said the ongoing drought has caused a serious water scarcity in Kenya. She praised the charity group for building water tanks in schools.&ldquo;As the chairperson of the parliamentary Education Committee, I am pleading with more well-wishers to help schools with such programmes to make learning easier, especially during dry seasons,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;I'm urging the county government to invest in dams that will harvest flood water that will be used in dry spells.&rdquo;
