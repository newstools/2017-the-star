A family from Mungachi village in Webuye West has appealed to well-wishers to help them pay school fees for a blind boy. Soustine Lusweti scored 313 marks in last year&rsquo;s KCPE exam and wants to become a lawyer. He was to report to Thika National School for the Blind on January 9. He needs Sh17,000 for first term.Speaking to journalists on Thursday at their home, his mother Esther urged the Bungoma government, Governor Kenneth Lusaka and area MP Dan Wanyama to help them raise the fees.&ldquo;My husband, a cane cutter, earns very little money and I stay at home to care of these quadruplets . Hence,we cannot raise the fees,&rdquo; she said.Esther made headlines in 2014 for giving birth to the quadruplets through normal delivery. She has a child in form three and another in nursery school.&ldquo;We are disturbed ... He could lose his chance because we have no money, and yet he is a very bright boy who even topped in his class,&rdquo; she said.Any help can be sent through his father Lusweti on mobile phone number 0717699304 or paid to the school&rsquo;s Standard Chartered Bank account 0102042081100, Thika branch.
