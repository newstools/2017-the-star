Armed pastoralists from Samburu and Pokot have invaded Laikipia. They steal property, rustle cattle and sheep, and shoot people. This is not traditional grazing on ranches by pastoralists in times of drought. This is a virtual land grab. Small farmers are suffering as much as big farmers.The government has been petulantly stamping its feet, insisting there should be disarmament and respect for private property. In October Cabinet ordered the Interior CS to get rid of the invaders. But virtually nothing has happened. The police and KWS are overwhelmed by the more aggressive and better armed herders.The government appears paralysed, perhaps because politicians in Nairobi have persuaded the security agencies to go slow on the invaders.President Museveni in Uganda has his faults but he would not let this happen. He would send in the army and restore law and order. It is time for the KDF to restore security in Laikipia if the police cannot manage."The way I see it, if you want the rainbow, you gotta put up with the rain." - American country singer Dolly Parton was born on January 19, 1946
