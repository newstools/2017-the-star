Five pupils in Migori county are worried they may not be able to join secondary school because have not received their full KCPE exam results. They sat their exams at Ndemra, St Mary&rsquo;s Wachara and Abwao primary schools. Addressing the press in Migori town on Tuesday, county Knut branch executive secretary Caleb Opondi said head teachers&rsquo; have failed to resolve the problem. &ldquo;This case shows why the education reforms being praised need serious auditing to establish why some candidates are yet to get their results. This shows some results may not be accurate,&rdquo; he said. Abwao primary head teacher Kennedy Ondiek said they have written to the Kenya National Examinations Council several times, but they have not been helped . The affected pupils are Alila Okwach, Loo Bernard, Regan Omondi, Sheila Atieno and Aoko Belinda. &ldquo;I want to get my results like my peers and I request Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang&rsquo;i to help me continue with my education,&rdquo; Okwach said.
