Women have been dealt a major blow after a crucial bill seeking progressive implementation of the Constitution&rsquo;s two-thirds gender rule lapsed.The death of the bill, which had been published by the Justice and Legal Affairs committee, means it will have to be republished for it to make its way back to the National Assembly.The National Assembly&rsquo;s Standing Orders state that a bill whose second reading has not concluded after two consecutive sessions lapses at the end of the second session, meaning it has to be republished. The Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill 2015 sought to have more women nominated to Parliament through party lists, progressively.The principle was to be reviewed after 20 years, to meet the gender rule, providing that not more than two-thirds of one gender fill elective and appointive positions. The bill was the only hope for women after another bill &mdash; the Two Third Gender Laws (Amendment Bill) 2015 &mdash; moved by National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale was defeated in May last year. The bill drew passionate debate, especially from women lawmakers, who support affirmative action, to correct the skewed representation that stands at only 27 per cent compared to their male colleagues. In May last year, MPs defied President Uhuru Kenyatta and Cord leader Raila Odinga and rejected the gender bill.Uhuru met the Jubilee MPs to rally them while Raila was personally in the House during the voting process in which the bill was lost. Also on the receiving end was a bill intended to trigger Kenya&rsquo;s pullout from the Rome Statute &mdash; The International Crimes (Repeal) Bill, sponsored by Bumula MP Boniface Otsiula.The bill had been applauded by MPs anxious to pull Kenya from the Assembly of States Parties, the global agency that formed the International Criminal Court.
