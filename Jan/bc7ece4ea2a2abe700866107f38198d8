Lectures in public universities has resumed as salary talks between the institutions and unions&rsquo; representatives continue.The Inter-Public Universities Consultative Council Forum chairman Prof Ratemo Michieka said the talks with unions started on January 6, through a Joint Negotiation Committee in Nakuru. He said, &ldquo;Talks are taking place separately between the three unions &ndash; the University Academic Staff Union, the Kenya Universities Staff Union and the Kenya Union of Domestic, Hotels, Educational Institutions, Hospitals and Allied Workers&rdquo;The unions had on January 19 commenced the strike, but a court order stopped it and directed the two parties to engage in negotiations.Michieka said there is no way lecturers would be on strike when talks are going on. &ldquo;We [IPUCCF] are committed to the negotiation process. We hope they are concluded as soon as possible,&rdquo; he said. But Kusu secretary general Charles Mukhwaya said the IPUCCF has invited the unions for talks from Friday this week. &ldquo;We expect a counter-offer from the government in response to a proposal we first made on March 3, 2016,&rdquo; he said.Michieka said, however, the issue on whether there is a counter-offer from the government is part of the ongoing talks. University employees have been pushing for the conclusion of the 2013-17 CBA for three years without success. The unions argue that they would demand that implementation of the CBA be backdated to July 1, 2013. They also fear that by the end of March, the CBA will not be factored in the 2017-18 budget.The unions&rsquo; are demanding the least paid lecturer, earning Sh99,802, get Sh350,000. They want a professor, now earning Sh211,753, paid Sh1.9 million per month. Michieka said they have involved the Education and the Treasury ministries more than five times since January 6.
