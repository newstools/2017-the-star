It has emerged that 90 per cent of Mombasa&rsquo;s 42 MCAs did not know their colleague Serah Nyamvula, 58, had cancer. Her death caught them by surprise. Nyamvula died in an Indian hospital on Monday. She was diagnosed with lymphoma, cancer of the lymphatic system. The MCAs on Tuesday described her as a jovial and active person. &ldquo;She was always laughing and cracking jokes. It was hard to tell she was suffering,&rdquo; Mjambere MCA Khamis Mwabashiri said when they visited her home in Mtwapa, Kilifi. Kongowea&rsquo;s Jabess Oduor said Nyamvula did not show any sign of being sick and was vocal, especially about women&rsquo;s rights.
