But we simply cannot get into the prison now," he said.No prisoners had escaped, he added.Dozens of relatives have gathered outside, waiting for information.Riots are not uncommon in Brazil's overcrowded jails, which are largely controlled by powerful criminal gangs.But the scale of the violence this year has put pressure on President Michel Temer to address the problem.After the Amazonas prison riot, the government announced plans to build five more high security jails and to create new intelligence units to try to curb the power of the gangs behind bars.Read: Pope upset by Brazil jail riot, calls for humane prisonsAlso read: Brazil's justice minister proposes overhaul of penal system after 56 killed in prison massacre
