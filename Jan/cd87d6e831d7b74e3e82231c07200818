It is time to avenge the theft of your land by rejecting my land-grabbing rivals at the ballot, Lamu Governor Issa Timamy has urged residents.He told his two main rivals on Monday he will defeat them this year just as he did in 2013. Timamy told Fahim Twaha and Swaleh Imu to come face him &ldquo;if they are real men&rdquo;.He said he was very religious when he took office. Timamy said his popularity has grown such that even young children in the narrow streets call him by name.&ldquo;The year 2017 is here. Those who disappeared for five years will now resurface. But they should know that Lamu people are now clever, they cannot easily be cheated. If they bring their money, it will be taken and they will not get votes,&rdquo; he said.Timamy spoke on Monday during the launch of a Sh60 million bursary kitty for secondary school students at the Lamu Fort. He said everyone has the right to vote as he wishes.&ldquo;Their days are numbered. Fahim is outdated. I want them to come, including Imu, and even if there is a simu (an opponent called phone) I&rsquo;m ready for them,&rdquo; Timamy said. He urged residents not to vote on party lines. Timamy said some politicians are riding on the big parties to get elected but they have no agenda for the county.
