ODM has suspended the recruitment of party members to invest time and effort on mass voter registration set to be closed on February 14. Chairman John Mbadi said on Saturday that the listing of members remains suspended for the next two weeks.He said the concentration on getting new members on board was affecting targets expected to be reached in the 30-day voter listing."We have reviewed the progress of the ongoing mass voter registration and found out that it is far less satisfactory," he said in a statement to the press. Mbadi said one of the causes of the dismal performance was the aspirant's emphasis on party membership recruitment."This has been going on at the expense of voter registration," he said, further asking the party officials to educate members against falling into Jubilee traps."Let our members not to be duped into accepting Jubilee party's membership cards that are being hawked in various parts of the country," Mbadi said.The directive comes a day after President Uhuru Kenyatta asked Jubilee Party officials to halt the registration of members.He asked the party to put more effort towards the ongoing mass voter registration ahead of the August 8 vote.The President said the recruitment drive will resume at the close of the voter listing which kicked off on January 16.The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) started the one-month mass listing after phase one recorded dismal returns."We have decided to take the break to allow our supporters time to register as voters first," Uhuru said.Read: Uhuru halts Jubilee members' listing to pave way for mass voter registration
