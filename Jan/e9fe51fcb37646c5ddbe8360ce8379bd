We are asking the government to facilitate it,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;We are disabled and we can&rsquo;t run if there is chaos. We need peace because it is our constitutional right.&rdquo;Mwakilesho urged the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission to make all polling stations accessible to people living with disability.Many PWDs have avoided voting in the past due to inaccessibility, he said. &ldquo;It is not possible for us to vote when stations are inaccessible and there is threat of violence,&rdquo; Mwakilesho said.He asked people living with disability to register as voters, run for election and choose good leaders. &ldquo;Many times we have complained of bad leadership, but we fail by not participating in electing them. This time round we must prepare to vote,&rdquo; Mwakilesho said.
