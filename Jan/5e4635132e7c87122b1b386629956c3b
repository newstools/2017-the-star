More than 1,000 AP officers who graduated from various universities between July and December last year are demanding a pay rise.The officers in the ranks of constable and senior sergeant yesterday complained about &ldquo;unexplained delays&rdquo; in reviewing their salaries. They said their counterparts in the GSU and regular police had their salaries reviewed a month after graduating. &ldquo;This is discrimination. It is like we are lesser members of the National Police Service. Or why else would our reviews be delayed, while others got a pay rise almost immediately?&rdquo; an AP officer who sought anonymity said.&ldquo;We took out loans of up to Sh500,000 for undergraduate studies to improve our capacity to deliver better services. It is only fair to get the pay rise to be able to repay the loans.&rdquo;More than 1,200 APs were awarded degrees in July last year. Three hundred and ninety-seven were picked for the ongoing inspector&rsquo;s training course undertaken before promotion to the Inspector of Police position. &ldquo;We know not all of us can be promoted to the senior ranks because not all of us have the administrative skills and experience. But why deny us the higher pay?&rdquo; a policeman said. NPSC spokesman George Kinoti declined to comment, saying only the matter is being handled by the human resources department.&ldquo;I do not have information because that is not in my docket. That matter should be handled by the NPS and the Administration Police Service who verify the documents after they are submitted,&rdquo; he said.A police officer recruited at the constable level - with only a high school certificate - earns a basic salary of Sh25,000. The salary rises to at least Sh36,000 after an officer acquires a degree. A graduate police officer in the lower cadres should earn a minimum salary of Sh36,000 - the same as an Inspector of Police, depending on the years of service.
