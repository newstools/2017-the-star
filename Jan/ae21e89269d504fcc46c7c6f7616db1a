Murang'a county leaders have told off 'Team Nairobi' for "trying to intimidate" former Gatanga MP Peter Kenneth in his bid for Nairobi governor.The leaders said Nairobi is a metropolitan region where anyone can seek elective posts and other leadership positions."It is very sad to see leaders, whom we presume to have matured politically, fighting our son because he has declared interest in a seat he has the right to vie," Kiharu MP Irungu Kang'ata said on Tuesday."They should carry out research... They will be shocked about how much interest Murang'a people have in the city."Kang'ata, who is leading the Murang'a wing for Kenneth's bid, further said those fighting the former MP are simply scared."They know they have no impact on Nairobi voters, who have direct and indirect links with Murang'a. They have no choice but to work with Murang'a," he said.Kandara MP Alice Wahome said fighting Kenneth means doom for Nairobi leaders.Citing Kenneth's tenures as MP and assistant minister in former President Mwai Kibaki's government, she said Kenneth is a known performer.Kigumo MP Jamleck Kamau said references to Kenneth as an &ldquo;outsider" amount to political backwardness.He said a candidate&rsquo;s competency, skills and ability to deliver are what should matter.&ldquo;Nairobi belongs to all of us as it the capital city. So anyone can vie... Voters will decide who they want to govern them,&rdquo; he told the Star by phone.Kenneth announced his intentions to run for Nairobi governor on a Jubilee ticket last Sunday.But Jubilee aspirants, led by Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko, have launched a scathing attack on him.At Jubilee's grand meeting at Kasarani stadium last Friday, Sonko said nobody will be pushed from outside the county to confuse the people in the race for county chief.More on this: 'Foreigners' not welcome to Nairobi governor race - SonkoRead: Peter Kenneth wanted Uhuru jailed at ICC, must apologise to Kenyans - SonkoSonko intends to vie for the governor's seat on a Jubilee ticket.Others who have expressed interest in vying under Jubilee are former Starehe MP Margaret Wanjiru, Nominated MP Johnson Sakaja and Dagoretti MP Dennis Waweru.[VIDEO] Peter Kenneth has not fought for Uhuru, do not be swayed by skin color - Moses KuriaKenneth announced his bid at a service he attended alongside Nominated Senator Beatrice Elachi and MPs Rachel Shebesh (Nairobi woman rep) and James Gakuya (Embakasi North).Others were MPs George Theuri (Embakasi West), Waihenya Ndirangu (Roysambu), Yusuf Hassan (Kamukunji), John Njoroge (Kasarani), John Omondi (Embakasi East) and several MCAs He was initially torn between running in the city or in Murang&rsquo;a.
