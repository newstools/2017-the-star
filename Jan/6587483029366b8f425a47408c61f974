A 68-year-old French tourist checked out of the hotel she booked at Mkunguni, Lamu, on Sunday and stayed under a tree, sayingthe hotel was dirty. Lioudmila Sergueevitch arrived in Lamu on Sunday evening and booked a room. But she changed her mind and forced the attendants to carry all her belongings to Mkunguni Square.Members of the public became suspicious when they saw her alone with her bags at 10pm and called the police. The tourist refused to speak to the officers until they took her to the station. Sergueevitch said Lamu wasn&rsquo;t what she had been made to believe. &ldquo;They said it is a good place for old people like me, but I am not happy here. It is dirty. I just want dawn to come so I can leave,&rdquo; she said.
