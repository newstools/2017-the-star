A court in Nairobi on Thursday pardoned a JKIA engineer who was facing charges of assaulting his wife at Nyayo Embakasi estate.Felix Onduru was set free after his wife Vivian Atieno withdrew the charges pressed against him following the December 23 incident.Onduru was booked for causing Atieno serious injuries after a disagreement with his lover who stormed their home demanding some cash.The prosecution said that the suspect is married to Atieno but had a relationship with another lady around their neighbourhood.The court was told that the lover sent her house help to Onduru's house to ask for the Sh200,000 owed to her, which the man said he would send.Onduru, his wife and the woman in question fought over the matter, during which Atieno was allegedly pushed by the husband and was injured.Atieno fell down bleeding, was rushed to the hospital and later reported the matter to the police leading to Onduru's arrest.In court, Atieno said she had forgiven Onduru even though she has been hurt by his behaviour of having other women outside their marriage."I still forgive him for assaulting me but he should stop what he is doing as it is ruining our marriage," she said at Makadara law court on Thursday.Chief magistrate Heston Nyaga withdrew the case following the woman's (Atieno) submissions.
