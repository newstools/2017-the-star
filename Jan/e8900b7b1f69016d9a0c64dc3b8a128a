The rehabilitation of the Rai Paper Mills has not stalled, but the plant has been shut for a while so the roof can be repaired before rains start, Bungoma Trade executive Patrick Kooi has said.Speaking on Tuesday, he dismissed claims the mill, opened on December 15 last year by President Uhuru Kenyatta, has collapsed. "We wonder why a senior politician can go to the media and say this factory is not working, yet everything is intact and paper is being manufactured,&rsquo;&rsquo; Kooi said.He said close to six tonnes of paper are produced daily. &ldquo;Around 78 tonnes of paper have been produced since it was opened mid-last month,&rsquo;&rsquo; Kooi said.Kooi said management of the factory, previously known as the Webuye Pan Paper Mills, wants to replace old roofing to ensure workers operate in a safe, comfortable environment. The bankrupt factory closed nine years ago, leaving many people jobless.
