Falling water levels in hydroelectric dams is not likely to result in higher electricity bills for households and businesses, Kenya Power has reassured. Newly appointed acting chief executive Ken Tarus said the country has a &ldquo;good energy mix&rdquo; of power sources with capacity to keep output at optimum levels, despite the drop in water levels after failed December rains. There are mounting fears state-owned electricity producer KenGen may switch on diesel-run generators for expensive thermal electricity to cover for the expected drop in hydro-electric power. &ldquo;You may be aware that we have diversified the sources of our generation from geothermal, wind and solar, and therefore we might not have changes in terms of pricing,&rdquo; Tarus said in Nairobi, when he took over office from CEO Ben Chumo. Energy CS Charles Keter and top officials from KenGen are set to assess the water levels at Masinga Dam this morning. Keter is expected to &ldquo;outline measures the ministry and Kenya Electricity Generating Company are taking to meet the expected shortfall in power and avoid load management situation&rdquo;, the ministry said in a statement. Latest data from Kenya Power shows the country&rsquo;s energy mix dispatched has improved from 53 per cent hydro, 25 per cent thermal and 20 per cent geothermal in June 2013 to 41 per cent hydro, 13 per cent thermal and 40 per cent geothermal as at the end of December 2016. This puts the country&rsquo;s renewable energy at about 83 per cent of total installed capacity, boosted by the injection of additional 280 megawatts of geothermal energy to the national grid in 2015. &ldquo;The installed capacity, which stood at 1,765MW in June 2013, has increased to 2,327MW as at December 2016, reflecting a 32 per cent additional generation capacity. Out of the 678MW new generation, 427.5MW is from renewable sources,&rdquo; Chumo, whose tenure expires officially today, said. The average retail tariff has reduced to Sh13.68 per kilowatt hour from a high of Sh23.06 per KWh, 43 per cent drop, the management said. The cost of power has, however, remained high with the cost of electricity increasing in December, the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics latest data shows. Households which consumed 50KWh hour paid Sh558.9 up from Sh529.32 in November, a 5.6 per cent increase.Those who used 200KWh paid Sh3,497 last month compared to Sh3,378 the previous month, a 3.5 per cent increase, KBNS December inflation data shows.
