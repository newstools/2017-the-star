Though she's single now, beautiful singer and actress Avril was once engaged to wealthy South African businessman by the name Leslie Mugadza aka Muga.The two broke up after a 3-year engagement, news that Avril confirmed back in July 2016 after swirling rumors that the two were not walking down the aisle, and persistent denial by the lovebirds to officially confirm the breakup.Avril, real name Judith Nyambura dated the real estates developer and a venture capitalist from 2014 and the two could not stay away from each other after confirming that they were indeed an item, but with time, things went sour.Rumours of trouble in paradise started when Muga shared a photo on Valentine's day with former Namibian Big Bother Africa winner Dillish Matthews back in 2016, causing chaos online as fans jumped to conclusions that Avril had been dumped for Dillish.The Nikimuona hitmaker, later on, came to reveal that the two were very much together but a few months down the line, the truth about their relationship status was revealed after the singer finally confessed that she had broken off the engagement, a few weeks after her dad sadly passed away.The two seem to have moved on as Avril revealed that if a good man comes her way, she will definitely give dating another chance as her ex-fianc&eacute; is all about his businesses and focus on making more money and investments.Well, talking of mulla and investments, the real estate dealer has taken to his social media to give young men who want to be successful a tip or two. Muga did not hold back, taking shots at dude's who drink up and party yet they could instead invest that money.He also talked about how some people buy expensive machines/cars on installments instead of buying something like a house so that they can have a secure future for themselves and their families. This businessman is truly wise and I bet that's why he's so successful.Check out the inspiring post from Muga below;"To all my brothers now that I have your full attention with that picture have you ever thought that instead of getting that nice BMW on installments would be quite awesome to pay those installments to own property? Look at it this way if we enrich landlords say in sandton paying rent for about 12k a month or so that is a solid house bond/mortgage which in a few years you could own it outright and set your family for life. The bottles we pop in the club can easily start a small business which can generate more and more and build multiple streams of income. You see the way I see it flossing before you financially literate and stable is a waste because we will keep on working and working without gaining meaningful assets that set our families. It's cool to have that Spanky new car on Finance and stay in a nice rented apartment and roll with the flyest women but can we sustain that lifestyle and set our families to have generational wealth? I wish someone had taught me financial literacy at a young age so if you have the opportunity to improve it now then let's go for it. Suffer now floss later."
