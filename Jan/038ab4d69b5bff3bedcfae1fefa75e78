The NTSA has dismissed claims it forced speeding drivers to carry placards showing they broke traffic laws during the December holidays as punishment.Deputy director John Munya yesterday told the Star the photos doing the rounds on social media are fake.&ldquo;We did not force anyone to do anything. We told them to choose between going to court and lifting the placards and they chose the latter,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;The authority is not out to punish anyone. What we do is sensitise the drivers to instill discipline on the roads.&rdquo; The transport regulator last month devised a new way of punishing traffic offenders at Sachangwan black spot on the Nakuru-Eldoret highway.The authority told traffic offenders to carry placards written, &ldquo;Kindly observe lane discipline, don&rsquo;t be like me.&rdquo; Munya said the authority carried out a series of awareness campaigns during the holdiay season targetting drivers and pedestrians.&ldquo;We literally let the speeding drivers get out of their cars and educated them on why they shouldn&rsquo;t speed and why they should maintain lane discipline. We then let them weigh their options,&rdquo; he said. This comes after the authority was criticised for the method used to punish traffic rule offenders. Some people said lifting the placards was humiliating and intimidating.
