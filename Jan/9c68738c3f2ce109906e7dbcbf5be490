Barely a week after leading a delegation to DP William Ruto&rsquo;s Sugoi home, Mt Elgon MP John Serut has threatened to campaign against the Jubilee government for excluding the region in development.Speaking in his constituency on Wednesday, he said despite the Sabaot community voting for Jubilee leaders almost to a man in 2013, President Uhuru Kenyatta and Ruto have forgotten the region.&ldquo;We are the only constituency that wholly supported and voted for the Jubilee administration, but we have received a raw deal from it. No serious projects in Mt Elgon and if there are any, they can tell us,&rdquo; Serut said.He was speaking at Kaptoboi Secondary School in Cheptais subcounty, when he issued Sh2 million CDF cheques.&ldquo;Ruto has been busy roaming Webuye East and Webuye West to raise funds for various projects, but he has forgotten us, despite the fact that we contributed to their election. It is time they launch projects in this region or I will launch a fierce campaign against them,&rdquo; Serut said.The MP, who was elected as an independent candidate, said Jubilee leaders are visiting the region now because elections are around the corner. Serut said the launch of the tarmacking of the Kapsokwony-Kopsiro-Namwela-Cheptais-Chepkube road is welcome, but Jubilee should launch more projects.
