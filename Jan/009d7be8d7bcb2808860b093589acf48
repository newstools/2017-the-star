The Kenya Forest Service will reject plans by City Hall to use as a graveyard a 67-acre forest near the filled-up 100-acre Lang&rsquo;ata Cemetery.Instead, the KFS has asked the county to explain what it did with 50 acres the government gave it in the 1990s for the expansion of the graveyard.Last week, Lands executive Christopher Khaemba said, &ldquo;We have asked them [KFS] to take the cemetery and convert it into a forest and they give us their land next to the cemetery.&rdquo;The Lang&rsquo;ata Cemetery, which was meant to accommodate 50,000 bodies, was declared full in 1996.KFS Natural Forest Conservation and Management deputy director Charity Munyasia said though the agency is yet to receive a formal request from City Hall, they will reject it.&ldquo;Converting forest land to other uses is tedious. The land has to be degazetted, a process that must pass through Parliament,&rdquo; she said.Cemetery land turned into estateMunyasia said that in the 1990s, the then Department of Forest acquired 50 acres on Ngong Road and allocated it to the defunct city council for the expansion of the cemetery.She said the land has been turned into an estate instead.&ldquo;Our maps are showing that the land is not a forest. So what did City Hall do with the land? They need to answer this question,&rdquo; Munyasia said.The director said that it is unheard of to convert a cemetery into a forest. &ldquo;It is not only against our culture, but also disrespectful to the dead,&rdquo; she said.Khaemba had told the Star that the plan to swap the property came after the KFS rejected an earlier request to sell the land to the county government.Munyasia said the agency rejected the request after City Hall failed to explain what it did with the 50 acres.&ldquo;In 2008, they came to us asking for more land, but when we asked them what they did with the land we gave them, they ran away and went to look for rocky land in Mavoko,&rdquo; she said.Since then, residents have been digging up old graves halfway to bury extra bodies, hence not meeting the recommended six feet depth.Previous attempts by the county to acquire a new graveyard have been unsuccessful, mainly due to unavailability of land and high costs. Millions lost in graveyard scandalIn 2009, a scandal unfolded after the city council paid Sh283 million for 48.5 acres in Mavoko, Machakos county. City Hall lost millions of shillings as the value of the property was estimated to be Sh24 million.Khaemba said the Mavoko land is rocky. The land still lies idle.
