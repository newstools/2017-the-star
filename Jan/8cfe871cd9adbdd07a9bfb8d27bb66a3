NYS suspect Ben Gethi's mother on Thursday lost her bid to have a motor vehicle seized by the Assets Recovery Agency released to her.High court judge Hedwing Ongudi said that Charity Wangui Gethi did not present material facts to show that she deserves the order for the motor vehicle's release.The judge ruled that the Sh7.3 million car was a subject matter of a criminal charge she is facing together with ten other suspects linked to the Sh1.6 billion NYS scam.Ongudi ruled that the November 2016 order for the seizure and retention of the KCD 241Q Jeep Cherokee was properly issued.She said that investigations in the criminal case had established that the money used to purchase the vehicle was stolen from NYS.Ongudi said that the vehicle is registered under Charity's name, and the latter is facing money laundering charges before a chief magistrate court.The judge ordered Gethi's mother to pay cost of the application after she argued that the continued retention has caused her transport hardships.Muthoni Kimani, Assets Recovery Agency director, had demonstrated to the court how the vehicle was procured through the NYS cash under probe.The said motor vehicle is being held at the CID as per the court order. Other accused persons in the case are Josephine Kabura, Martin Gachara and John Kago.The charges against the four reads that they jointly engaged in an arrangement to purchase a motor vehicle registration number KCB 750Z Range Rover at Sh 23 million.The prosecution has stated that this was executed between December 2014 and April 30, 2015 in Nairobi using funds stolen from NYS.Read: High Court orders Ben Gethi's mother to surrender Sh7.3 million Jeep in two days]Also read: Ben Gethi's mother cleared in Sh791 NYS cash theft case
