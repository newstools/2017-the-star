Failure to hold credible nominations has cost ODM critical seats in the past polls, chairman John Mbadi said on Monday.The Gwassi MP said that a number of leaders were forced to defect to other parties following shambolic primaries."Let us be honest. We cannot afford to make the past mistakes," he said at the weekend during an event in Migori county.Mbadi said the chaotic primaries was the reason Governor Okoth Obado, the host at the event, left ODM for PDP."ODM did not have proper nominations especially for the Migori governor seat," he said. He cited 2013 general election as the time when the Orange party was adversely affected by the defections.Mbadi said that, going forward, ODM has put in place measures to ensure a free, fair, and transparent nominations.The MP said that no candidate will be favoured during the primaries tentatively slated for February."The will of the people will be respected. Aspirants must therefore concentrate on selling their policies to the electorate," Mbadi said.He echoed ODM party leader Raila Odinga's assurance that no candidate will be imposed on the people."Our party leader has pledged that he will respect the will of the people and work with those who shall be elected," Mbadi said.He cited Nyatike as among the areas in the county where only two of the seven elected MCAs got to office through an ODM ticket.Mbadi said the problem started in 2007 and promised that the party was keen on stopping the 'worrying trend'.The official also dismissed allegations that only candidates close to him will get the party's ticket to contest various seats in the August 8 election.Read: Aspirants shun ODM over nomination feesAlso read: ODM set tough nomination rules ahead of Thursday deadlineHe termed such accusations as baseless and told candidates as well as party supporters to 'disregard such propaganda'."As the national chairman, I want to assure our members that such cannot and will not be tolerated by the party leadership at all cost," he added.The MP further asked his elected counterparts to accommodate those who express interest in working with ODM.The sentiment was backed by nominated MP Oburu Oginga who said the party had learnt from the past nominations. "I will also take part in the nominations despite the fact that I am Raila's brother. Let nobody lie to you that they can rig their way after losing the primaries," Oburu said.
