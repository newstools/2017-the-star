The party said it followed the law and Malulu has neither appealed nor communicated his displeasure with the decision.Malulu was the only MP elected on the MDP ticket in the March 4, 2013, general election. Malulu, together with MPs Ben Washiali (Mumias East), Emmanuel Wangwe (Navakholo), Bernard Shinali (Ikolomani), formerly of UDF, and Matungu&rsquo;s David Were, of the dissolved New Ford Kenya, joined the Jubilee Party on September 10. A by-election will provide an opportunity to JP and NASA to gauge their popularity. JP was formed on September 10 last year, while opposition parties have coalesced around NASA, which is yet to be formally launched.
