Attorney General Githu Muigai has been directed by a court to appoint a representative in a case filed by traders and fishermen seeking to have Ugandan soldiers removed from the disputed Migingo Island in Lake Victoria.The case came up for direction yesterday before Justice Chacha Mwita, who was told the AG is yet to enter an appearance in the suit, despite having been served. The judge directed the parties to return to court on February 7 for further directions.The directive follows failure by legal representatives of some state agencies to appear in court on Tuesday, when the matter was scheduled for hearing.The fishermen have sued the National Security Council, the Defence Council, the Kenya Defence Forces, the Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of Interior, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the AG.They say security agencies have for years failed to take action, despite having received reliable information regarding violations of human rights on the island by the Ugandan soldiers.The businessmen want the court to order the government to issue a declaration that the Ugandan security officers are unwelcome on the island . They accuse the Ugandan officers of arresting, torturing, harassing them and confiscating their boats, engines, fishing gear and money.The businessmen also want compensation for the losses made and a declaration that the Kenyan security agencies failed to protect their rights, which are enshrined in the Constitution.
