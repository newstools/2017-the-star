The Registrar of Political Parties Lucy Ndung&rsquo;u has deleted Malava MP Malulu Injendi&rsquo;s name from the Maendeleo Democratic Party register over his move to JP. The name was expunged on December 13, following resolution by the party. Malulu is the only MP who was elected on the party ticket in the March 4, 2013, general election. Malulu, MPs Ben Washiali (Mumias East), Bernard Shinali (Ikolomani), Emmanuel Wangwe (Navakholo), of the defunct UDF and Matungu&rsquo;s David Were of the dissolved New Ford Kenya joined the Jubilee Party on September 10.A by-election is likely to be held in Malulu, if the Registrar of Political Parties write to National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi. The speaker will declare the seat vacant and issue a writ to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission to call for a by-election. A by-election would provide a chance for JP to gauge its strength in Kakamega county, an area perceived as opposition friendly.Caleb Sunguti, a lecturer at the School of Government said Ndung'u's action by Ndung&rsquo;u should sound a warning to opposition MPs who quit their parties to join JP.Omukanda said that the party resolved to kick Injendi out after he failed to honour several summons to appear before its organs to defend himself.
