The governor's council on Monday threatened to sue the state following the withdrawal of Mombasa governor Hassan Joho and his Kilifi counterpart Amason Kingi's bodyguards.Chairman Peter Munya said they will move to court so that the government can be compelled to reinstate the security detail of the two county leaders.In a statement to the media, the Meru governor said that the recall of the said security officers - on grounds that the leaders do not support the government - was unacceptable.Munya said they have booked an appointment with President Uhuru Kenyatta to critically deliberate on the matter."Security cannot be a preserve of those who support the government of the day. It is a legal obligation on the part of the state to provide security to its citizens. We intend to challenge the unlawful decision in court," the governor said.This comes after the government withdrew the two governors' bodyguards - drawn from the General Service Unit - ordering them to immediately report back to their stations.The government however denied claims that the move, which came after the Mombasa governor dressed down Uhuru over projects in the region, was politically instigated.State House spokesman Manoah Esipisu said the move was part of the reorganisation of the regional command structure.ODM leaders had asked Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery to reinstate the security details of the two governors.They had initially given Nkaissery a two-day ultimatum on the matter, but later said they would deliberate with the Cord NEC on the next course of action.In March last year, Joho&rsquo;s security details were also withdrawn in a move believed to be punishment for being a staunch Opposition supporter.Read: ODM leaders ask Nkaissery to reinstate Joho, Kingi security detailAlso read: Cord divided over Joho, Kingi security detail
