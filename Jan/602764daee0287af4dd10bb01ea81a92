A road construction company has sued the Kenya Revenue Authority to stop it from recovering Sh283 million in tax arrears. Gibb Africa Limited says the money demanded by the taxman is illegal.The demand notices by the KRA, the court was told, have frozen the accounts of the company making it impossible for it to meet its operational expenses, which has grounded its work. &ldquo;The petitioner (Gibb Africa) will be unable to pay employee&rsquo;s wages and salaries when they become due. It will also not be able to cater for other crucial operational expenses,&rdquo; the suit papers filed in court read in part.Gibb Africa says the KRA issued the demand notices against it knowing the former was unable to pay the principal tax because government agencies had not paid their debts. It is owed in excess of Sh500 million by state agencies for services rendered, Gibb Africa says.According to suit papers, the KRA and the company reached an agreement last September that the demand notices be issued only to some specific debtors of Gibb Africa and not all.However, in total breach of the agreement, the court heard, the KRA issued demand notice on December 15 indiscriminately to Gibb Africa&rsquo;s debtors as well as bankers.The demand by the KRA suggests that the company owes the government Sh283,737,490 in total. Out of this, the principal amount assessed by the KRA is Sh219,136,226, while penalty and interest comes to Sh64,601,164.Gibb Africa is disputing the figure saying the taxman is only entitled to Sh166 million.And even the Sh166 million, Gibb Africa says, it can only remit to the KRA once the government pays what it owes it.Gibb Africa says the demand notices issued by the KRA have violated its rights to fair administrative action and right to property, and wants the court to quash them.The company employs 150 Kenyans and has in the past five years paid in excess of Sh617 million in tax to the government, contributing directly and indirectly to the economy.
