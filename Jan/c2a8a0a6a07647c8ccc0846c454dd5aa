Webuye West MP Dan Wanyama has dismissed the opposition's meeting at Bomas of Kenya as pitiful.Wanyama noted the opposition is yet to pick a presidential flagbearer, less than seven months to the general election."We in Jubilee established our candidate way back, and that is President Uhuru Kenyatta. This is the homestretch... Jubilee has finished the game," he said on Wednesday."I want to tell Kenyans not to worry about NASA as it has the headache of choosing who will be its flagbearer, something that is likely to drift them apart."He asked Cord and its affiliates to forget about the August 8 poll and strategise instead for the 2022 election.Read: Opposition to unveil candidate in 60 daysThe MP said Jubilee has already won because of the projects it has initiated since getting into power in March 2013."I am shocked at my fellow politicians from the opposition who keep saying Jubilee leaders in Western are in government because of their tummies. We're asking them why they didn't also carry their tummies to the opposition," he said.Wanyama asked opposition leaders to stop inciting Kenyans and tell them what better things they can do for the country.He said Western residents have opened their eyes and are fed up with empty promises and retrogressive politics.The opposition met on Wednesday to chart the way forward following Uhuru's decision to sign the controversial Election Laws (Amendment) Act.They announced they would have a single flagbearer at the event that has been interpreted as the formation of the National Super Alliance.More on this: Pray for NASA to solidify, trounce Jubilee, Mudavadi tells Bomas crowdRead: Kanu leaders split on NASA move as Kittony dismisses Salat's 'personal' statementAmani leader Musalia Mudavadi said no leader in the opposition parties will be belittled as together they make a "big team".
