Three allies of Deputy President William Ruto &mdash; at odds over the NYS saga &mdash; on Monday exchanged bitter words over their loyalty to the DP.Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen, Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago and Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter were waiting for President Uhuru Kenyatta to arrive at the burial of Mark Too in Kapseret.Keter accused Murkomen of betraying Ruto politically. &ldquo;Tell us what is the problem? Why have you been betraying us? Just tell us now,&rdquo; he said. The three, who spoke in Kalenjin and English, argued near journalists who overheard the exchange.Murkomen said claims he is a &ldquo;traitor&rdquo; are false. He said Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi helped him acquire a plot near the Eldoret International Airport, only for the MP and Keter to turn around and claim it was bought out of the NYS scandal proceeds.&ldquo;You knew very well I used my own money to buy the plot and I wonder why you guys later claimed it was from NYS cash,&rdquo; Murkomen said.Mandago appeared to calm Keter and Murkomen, but he was heard saying it is not good for the leaders to engage in politics of betrayal. The argument ceased when Uhuru arrived.Last month Keter and Sudi told the press in Eldoret that they urged Murkomen to carry his own cross in the NYS saga. They said he should stop causing divisions between the DP and some Rift Valley leaders.&ldquo;He is a mere senator and he should not imagine that he is the DP. In fact, we will go to Elgeyo Marakwet and apologise to residents because one of us was involved in the NYS saga,&rdquo; Sudi said. In his address at the funeral, Murkomen said he bought land near Too&rsquo;s home in a deal brokered by Sudi.At one point, he tried to leave but was held back by Keter.
