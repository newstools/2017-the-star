ICDC chairman Francis Kimemia has denied claims he will sack Nyandarua county officials and employ his stalwarts if elected governor.On Monday, he said, &ldquo;My rivals shudder because they know they will lose. That is why they have been peddling the rumour and instilling fear among workers. I want to assure Nyandarua public servants we will work as one.&rdquo;Kimemia spoke at Ngorika Farm in Ol Kalou, after condoling with 95-year&ndash;old Mau Mau veteran Joram Kiambati.Kiambati&rsquo;s grandson Brian was killed on Thika Road on December 31, 2015, by a drunk driver speeding to avoid a breathalyser test. Brian was a third-year civil engineering student at the University of Nairobi. Kimemia urged county officials to maintain integrity and protect public property. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fall into the temptation to plunder public resources,&rdquo; he said. Kimemia said he will work to make Nyandarua the best performing county.He said he will not go after officials implicated in graft. &ldquo;They have been captured in the Auditor General&rsquo;s reports, and it will not be my business as governor to take him to court or jail.I don&rsquo;t use vendetta,&rdquo; Kimemia said.
