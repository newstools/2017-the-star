Jubilee plans to sue banks and investors undertaking the Sh200 billion Mombasa housing project, despite the High Court&rsquo;s ruling that the county should go ahead with the venture.Banker Suleiman Shahbal said on Sunday the foreign banks did not follow due process in financing the project. He said foreign investors are planning to take advantage of the &ldquo;irregular&rdquo; plans and the current state of confusion.Shahbal spoke at a press conference at Jubilee Coast regional headquarters in Nyali . He did not, however, point out the irregularities. Judge Patrick Otieno last month ruled that the court was satisfied that public participation was conducted, contrary to a petition that had been filed.He said the project should proceed, but regular updates given and a suggestion box provided. The project involves demolishing and rebuilding 10 old estates.
