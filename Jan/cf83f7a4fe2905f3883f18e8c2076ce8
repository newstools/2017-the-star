Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen has castigated Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho for lecturing President Uhuru Kenyatta over projects. Murkomen said at the launch of Jubilee's smart card at Kasarani stadium on Friday that the President's development record is known and should not be criticised."Uhuru has a record that cannot be matched. We are a party that has a vision. In this nation, we must hold everyone to account," he said.He asked the Governor to stop lecturing the President on such matters.The Senator was responding to Joho's demand for the President to list projects his government has started and finished, for the benefit of Coast residents.Uhuru was in Mombasa for the launch of the Buxton Bridge, which the Governor said had been funded by the World Bank, not his administration.He boasted about his administration's allocation of large amounts of money to Coast counties, Mombasa in particular, but the Governor dismissed him.Joho praised the President for launching the complete projects but asked him to oversee others right from the start.Read: [VIDEO] Joho lectures Uhuru on hijacking Mombasa projectsThe Senator, without mentioning names, said key leaders in the opposition have no papers.
