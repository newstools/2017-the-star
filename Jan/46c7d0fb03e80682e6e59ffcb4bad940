More than 300 residents of Golini, Kwale county breathed a sigh of relief after the National Land Commission nullified title deeds issued to non-locals.Chairman Muhamad Swazuri said the title deeds were erroneously given to the lot despite the fact that area residents occupied the said parcel of land.The Golini Settlement Scheme titles were issued by President Uhuru Kenyatta in 2013, sparking a row among locals who asked NLC to revoke them.The documents were rendered null after they were verified by the Kwale County government and NLC following a complaint by residents."We have a lot of issues in settlement schemes like Diani complex, Ukunda, Ramisi and Shimba hills," Swazuri said.Read: Verify land before issuing titles, say MPs He said the residents will be issued allotment letters before they begin the process of acquiring title deeds for the plots.Swazuri said that the commission will consider lease owner, locals and county government in the decision to to renew expired land leases in the area. While on a tour of Kwale, he also asked locals of Somali origin to allow Maasais and Durumas to graze their animals at Kuranze ranch.He said that a lot of issues touching on ranches in Laikipia, Nyandarua, Kajiado, Samburu, Narok and Lamu has been shared with them."The Community Land Act will address such issues through the respective county governments," he said.The land agency boss also asked Kwale county to go slow on its plan to construct a recreational facility at Baraza Park.This was after Kaya chairman in Kwale Abdallah Kushinda said they don&rsquo;t want development at the park."If we allow this to go on, other traders will bring their structures and make this park a market center which is not good," Kushinda said."We have moved to court after the county refused to hear us out. So, we ask NLC to help us stop the construction," he said.But Kwale land executive committee member Ali Mafimbo said that the county has no intention to take anyone&rsquo;s land.Kwale woman representative Zainab Chidzuga asked NLC and Kwale county to address the land issues with speed. "We want Golini land titles revoked. Outsiders who have titles for the land are not welcome in the area when there are genuine locals," she said.Matuga MP Hassan Mwanyoha asked the county government to ensure all elected leaders in the area are involved in decisions on land issues.
