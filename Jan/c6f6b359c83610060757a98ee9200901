Mombasa governor aspirant Anania Mwaboza's statement that the Mijikenda are being used by other communities to clinch power has caused division in the community. The Mijikenda vote bloc is crucial for any of the governor aspirants as they hold the majority votes in the county.A divided community means divided votes in the August 8 polls.Ibrahim Kai, who is Nyali MP Hezron Awiti's confidant, has said the deputy governor position is not ceremonial as Mwaboza claimed on Saturday.He said the Mijikenda have to work with other communities to enjoy the fruits of devolution.Mijikenda Youth Forum chairman Nyonga wa Makemba said Mwaboza's statement is divisive and undermines the community's push for power in Mombasa. The Mijikenda community has over 130,000 registered voters in Mombasa.Coast People's Forum co-founder Naomi Cidi said the numbers will not count if the community does not unite. With the wrangles in Jubilee, she said, the community will give Cord an easy victory in the governor race.Awiti, Governor Hassan Joho, banker Suleiman Shahbal, Senator Hassan Omar and Mwaboza are all eyeing a big chunk of the Mijikenda votes to boost their chances of victory in the governor contest.&ldquo;He is the one being used to divide the community. The Mijikenda are not the only community living in Mombasa,&rdquo; Kai said on the phone on Wednesday.&ldquo;For us to win, we must agree to work with non-Mijikendas.&rdquo;Kai's sentiments were echoed by Makemba, a confidant of Shahbal.Makemba told the Star Mwaboza wants to introduce tribal politics yet he "failed to help the community when he was Kisauni MP".&ldquo;Despite the numbers we have, we cannot win without the help of non-natives,&rdquo; he said.Makemba said their more than 130,000 votes will be divided among the five governor aspirants.On Saturday, Mwaboza told the Star the Mijikenda community must be united to fully enjoy the fruits of devolution, which, according to him, was meant to empower native communities.He dismissed the deputy governor position as a ceremonial position and said the community should not settle for it but aim higher.&ldquo;When Mwaboza says the Mijikenda should join hands and support one of our own, and backed by our neighbours from upcountry, I am labelled a tribalist,&rdquo; Mwaboza said on Saturday.Awiti and Joho want to have running mates from the Mijikenda community to boost their support bases.Shahbal has also lately been working closely with Beatrice Gambo, a Mijikenda who is rumoured to be one of the main contenders to be his running mate.Cidi said the Mijikenda need to unite to have a say in the management of resources in the region.A staunch Jubilee supporter, the political analyst and former Kenya Airports Authority deputy managing director said the Jubilee administration should listen to the voice of the people if they want to win Mombasa county.&ldquo;Unity, or the luck of it, has been our biggest problem,&rdquo; Cidi said on the phone Wednesday.The Dabaso Declaration, made on January 4, 2014, was meant to foster unity among Coastal leaders to boost their bargaining power.&ldquo;All leaders from the Coast across the political divide attended the meeting. We agreed that Kilifi North MP Gideon Mung&rsquo;aro would lead us. I don&rsquo;t know what went wrong,&rdquo; Cidi said.She is also the patron of Maendeleo ya Wanawake Organisation in Kilifi county.Mijikenda Youth Forum is organising a meeting in two weeks of all the Mijikenda leaders and members in Mombasa to chart the way forward, Makemba said.
