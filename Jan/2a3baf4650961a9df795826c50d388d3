Trans Nzoia Governor Patrick Khaemba has dismissed allegations that he has defected from Ford Kenya to Musalia Mudavadi&rsquo;s Amani National Congress. Khaemba said he is loyal to Ford Kenya.&ldquo;Through the Ford Kenya party ticket, I ascended to power and once I was the governor, I had to fulfil the promises I made to my people by leaving behind party affiliations. But it does not mean I am disrespectful to the party,&rdquo; he added.Khaemba said that as a leader he welcomes other leaders who visit the county and his closeness with them does not mean he is an enemy of Ford Kenya.He recently welcomed Deputy President William Ruto and Mudavadi on separate occasions.&ldquo;Now people are saying I have defected to ANC party and that my association with the Deputy President means I am not interested in the affairs of Ford Kenya Party. That is not true,&rdquo; Khaemba added.He said he cannot afford to disrespect any national leader who visits the county, as they represent all citizens.&ldquo;The President and Deputy President and any other leader must be respected as leaders of this country by virtue of their offices,&rdquo; the governor added.Khaemba said party politics are not supposed to create divisions.He said he has continued to support the party using his own funds and he would not use Trans Nzoia development cash for the party.&ldquo;I cannot take residents&rsquo; money to fund the party. People feel that Khaemba being a governor is supposed to bring in money into the party. That is insubordination,&rdquo; Khaemba added.The county boss spoke on Saturday in Kitale town when he visited the county referral hospital, which is being constructed. Last week, some Ford Kenya officials accused the governor of neglecting party affairs.&ldquo;Let governor Khaemba be prepared for a tough competition [against four aspirants], in which he might be kicked out,&rdquo; Ford Kenya Trans Nzoia branch secretary general Martin Waliaula told journalists.He spoke during a training for grassroots party officials.Waliaula accused the governor of showing little interest in cooperating with party officials.&ldquo;The governor has, most of the time, skipped our meetings,&rdquo; he added. But Governor Khaemba said he is ready to work with every resident and that is why he had to put aside party leanings to serve all residents without taking sides.&ldquo;Other governors have fought with party leaders but you have not heard that I have done such a thing,&rdquo; he said.
