An MP from Nyanza who had declared he had ditched ODM is the talk of the town. Reason? His political manoeuvres. The second term MP made a surprise appearance at the Bomas of Kenya during the opposition mass meeting last Wednesday. Before the gathering, he had a meeting with a Cord principal. His initial bravado to launch his own political outfit has fizzled out. Is the man planning to ditch ODM for a Cord affiliate party? Well, the eloquent MP faces an unprecedented onslaught from a former student leader. The student leader is also said to be close to Orange House. ***********A senior former TNA official mocked ODM supporters in a city restaurant after they claimed several former politicians are moving back to Cord from the government side. The politicians have always worked against opposition chief Raila Odinga (pictured) after being elected on the ODM ticket. The official alleged the defectors are just looking for a way back to the National Assembly and will remain loyal to those fighting Baba. He noted that those leaders who defected from ODM know very well after being elected it will be hard to send them away and they will work against ODM. ************Cartels within the Lands ministry are finding it hard to transact their dubious business and are unhappy after LandS CS Jacob Kaimenyi started a cleanup exercise aimed at weeding out employees with wayward activities. The cleanup, which has been going on for sometime, has seen scores of staff sent on compulsory leave after the rot in the ministry&rsquo;s departments came to the surface. Last week, the axe fell on a few individuals who were involved in the renewal of a lease in Westlands registered in the name of an individual other than the legitimate owner. This has sent shockwaves within the staff in the ministry. Corridors has also learnt that some staff members have not gone on leave for years, to continue their corrupt activities uninterrupted. The matter has been handed to the DCI and EACC and the staff have panicked. **********A political broker from Nyanza who has been flirting with the Jubilee regime is a man under siege. The MP has been seen several times attending high profile Jubilee events both in the capital city and upcountry, but his latest presence at Kasarani during the launch of the JP membership smartcard has brought matters to a head. It is unclear why the MP, who is well aware of the slim chances of his reelection bid in the ODM stronghold, decided to join hands with the &lsquo;enemy&rsquo;. The MP has been facing taunts from his opponents, ridiculing references to him as the community&rsquo;s &lsquo;modern traitor&rsquo;.
