Kanu's top leadership is split right in the middle, with one faction supporting the formation of the opposition outfit Nasa, while another adopts a wait-and see-approach.On Wednesday, secretary general Nick Salat, who attended the official launch of the National Super Alliance at the Bomas of Kenya, said Kanu is part of the outfit. Nasa brings together Raila Odinga (ODM), Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper), Moses Wetang'ula (Ford Kenya) and Musalia Mudavadi (ANC).But Salat's announcement was denounced by two members of the executive council, John Lonyangapuo (West Pokot senator) and Ziporah Kittony (nominated senator).Kittony dismissed the assertions as "personal", saying not all Kanu members are ready to join Nasa.Those behind the outfit want to use it to unite all the opposition voices to wrestle power from President Uhuru Kenyatta.Kittony said Salat's statement does not reflect the party's position on which political outfit it will join ahead of the election.She said Kanu's policies and decisions are guided by its constitution, which stipulates that such resolutions must first be discussed by the national delegates conference.&ldquo;Kanu supports the idea of opposition parties coming together in efforts to field one candidate, as that is a milestone for Kenya's growing democracy," Kitotny said in a statement on Wednesday evening."However, the remarks made by Hon Nick Salat at the Bomas of Kenya are his personal sentiments. They do not reflect in any way the position of the party on the matter of an election coalition at this juncture."Kittony said Salat's remarks have not been subjected to the internal constitutional processes for ratification.During the Bomas meeting, Salat, who was one of the speakers, said that Kanu is fully behind the formation of the alliance and will live by the resolutions of the meeting."Mimi kama katibu mkuu wa Kanu nawahakikishia kwamba tuko ndani kabisaa (As the secretary general of Kanu I want to assure you that we are fully part of Nasa," he said.Several Kanu branches in Rift Valley have backed Salat's decision to attend the Bomas meeting.Branch officials from Elgeyo Marakwet, Uasin Gishu and Nandi yesterday said Salat consulted them before attending the meeting.&ldquo;Salat is spokesman of the party and he did not attend the meeting without consultation as claimed. We told him to do so as grassroots officials," Elgeyo Marakwet branch vice chairman Paul Kibet said.He was with Uasin Gishu branch chairman David Chepsiror along with 13 others officials of Kanu from counties in the North Rift.Kibet said Kanu members were Kenyans who too were affected by mismanagement by the jubilee government.&ldquo;Eventually when we go for the NDC of the party we will endorse the decision taken by Salat at Bomas&rdquo;, said Kibet.The Kanu officials said they would host public forums in the North Rift region to inform members on why it was necessary for them to support NASA.But in a quick rejoinder, Lonyanpauo announced that the NEC will meet before end of this week to determine which disciplinary action to be taken against Salat.He also maintained that Salat's remarks were personal and did not represent those of the Independence party.&ldquo;Before end of this week,leadership of Kanu- national leadership will be meeting for which we will know what disciplinary measures to be meted against this member who chose to go and speak issues purporting to emanate from everybody,&rdquo; Lonyangapuo said.Also while appearing on Citizen tv's morning newspaper review show , Kakamega senator (Ford-K) said Kanu was not welcomed in NASA.He said had Kanu been part of NASA, its leader and Baringo senator Gideon Moi could have joined hands with the opposition in Senate to defeat the passage the contentious Election Laws (Amendments).&ldquo;We are not with Kanu. The time we were to demonstrate we were with Kanu is when we were voting for theses crazy laws and you should have seen how Gideon Moi was being talked to by President. He told him thou shall not vote with those people,&rdquo; Khalwale said.&ldquo;The fact that the boss of Kanu did not vote with us at the time he was most needed ,Kanu is not with us,&rdquo; he added.
