African Independent Pentecostal Church of Kenya Archbishop John Mugecha is dead.The 72-year-old had been ailing for a year. Mugecha died on Monday night at Outspan Hospital in the outskirts of Nyeri town.He led the church for more than three decades after it split from the African Independent Pentecostal Church of Africa. The vocal and outspoken cleric from Tetu constituency, Nyeri county, opened many churches around the country. Tetu leaders, led by deputy commissioner Herman Shambi, visited Mugecha&rsquo;s Ithe Kahuno home on Tuesday.He has left behind six children and a widow.Last year during the burial of Hannah Wanjiru, 94, the mother of Chief of Staff Joseph Kinyua at Wamagana in Tetu, Mugecha criticised Kinyua for not properly maintaining roads to his mother&rsquo;s home. But President Uhuru Kenyatta, who attended the funeral, said Kinyua&rsquo;s work is impressive. He said the archbishop should have consulted the President instead of the Chief of Staff.Local leaders, including parliamentary aspirant Peter Kamuthu, described Mugecha as a nationalist who loved his community. &ldquo;He loved to fight for the marginalised people in the community, especially the Tetu people. He would speak out his mind and was also very generous, kind and courageous,&rdquo; Kamuthu said. Nyeri woman representative aspirant Rahab Mukami described Mugecha as a fearless man of God, who was devoted to serving God.In November 2013 he was among clerics who urged the United Nations to defer for at least two years the ICC cases against President Uhuru and Deputy President William Ruto. He said Kenyans trust the two.
