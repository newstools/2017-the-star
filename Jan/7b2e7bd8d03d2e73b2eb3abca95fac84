Health CS Cleopa Mailu has denied he sanctioned the audit that revealed the possible loss of more than Sh5 billion at the ministry through irregular procurement.Auditor Bernard Mucheru had said he had the blessings of the CS to do the audit.Speaking during an interview on Citizen TV yesterday, Mailu said, &ldquo;I did not order the audit. It was done as a routine year-end closure. But I do not want to speculate on his [Mucheru&rsquo;s] thinking.&rdquo; He denied claims he leaked the audit report to the media.&ldquo;This issue of the audit is a normal year-end procedure. Unfortunately, we got into the problems. There were some financial irregularities, but not actual misappropriation of funds in real terms, the way it came out in the media,&rdquo; Mailu said.He said he only ordered audits on how institutions under the Health ministry manage grants from the national government.Mailu said the audit reports have been forwarded to the relevant institutions for action.The CS dismissed claims the audit revelations had strained his relationship with PS Nicholas Muraguri, adding that they get along.&ldquo;Everybody has a portfolio and there are responsibilities which are given. As a CS, I have my own responsibilities. I want to state that during the press conferences I held during that time if you followed carefully, I was on the side of my PS the whole time. And it is still my belief,&rdquo; Mailu said.The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission has gone quiet over the possible misappropriation, despite promising to produce a report within a month after the audit disclosures broke in October last year.Mucheru&rsquo;s interim audit report revealed that prominent individuals in the government were allocated tenders unprocedurally.
