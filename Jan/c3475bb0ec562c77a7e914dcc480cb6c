It was wrong for politician Peter Kenneth to come from "nowhere" and declare he will vie for Nairobi governor on a Jubilee ticket,&nbsp;Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria has said.Kenneth, who is former Gatanga MP, made his bid official on Sunday, saying he will address all the city problems that Governor Evans Kidero has failed to.The former MP,&nbsp;formerly of the Kenya National Congress party, said he will support JP leader President Uhuru Kenyatta in the August 8 general election.But Kuria said:&nbsp;" The other individual has never even fought for the President's g overnment.
