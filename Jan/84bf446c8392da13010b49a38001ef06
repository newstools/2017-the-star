Milk processor New KCC says it has started listing farmers in Rift Valley who it owed more than Sh500 million when the firm collapsed. The company shut down in 1998, but in 2003 it was revived by the government. The rebranded processor made the move after the controversial lawyer Simon Lilan said he had instructed his legal counterparts to file a lawsuit seeking to have the dairy company directly transferred to farmers who were the original owners. &ldquo;I have learnt that some people are secretly planning to grab the New KCC,&rdquo; Lilan said. But New KCC chief executive Nixon Sigei dismissed Lilan&rsquo;s claims, saying the dairy firm is a parastatal that cannot be taken over by individuals. During his tour of Nandi last month, President Uhuru Kenyatta said the New KCC will not be privatised, reassuring the farmers that they will be paid. &ldquo;As a company we are running smoothly, and the President was very clear on this matter. No one should fabricate falsehoods about New KCC,&rdquo; Sigei said. Lilan is demanding that the money should be paid along with accrued interest. He said the government should have handed back the dairy firm to farmers after repossessing it from individuals who had taken over its operations during former President Moi&rsquo;s regime. He insists the firm is not the government's property. &ldquo;You cannot sell what does not belong to you. So there should be no question of privatisation,&rdquo; Lilan said. The CEO said about 90 per cent of the farmers owed money have been listed in some counties. &ldquo;The farmers have to produce evidence and once it&rsquo;s confirmed and the process completed, the farmers will be paid,&rdquo; Sigei said. He said they are about to complete modernising the New KCC, which includes rehabilitation of the factory in Eldoret at a cost of more than Sh480 million.
