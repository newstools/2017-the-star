More than 30 people have been killed since March last year following cattle rustling and border clashes in Elgeyo Marakwet and West Pokot counties, leaders have said.Eighty-seven goats and sheep were stolen from Elgeyo Marakwet, and 10 cows from West Pokot in retaliatory attacks. This forced many residents to migrate last month.Eight cows and 21 goats have been recovered.The Marakwet East, Central and South Pokot subcounties have been worst hit.A peace meeting was held on Tuesday in Kamuligon. More than 500 residents from the two counties came together to discuss solutions to perennial clashes. Present were West Pokot Senator John Lonyangapuo, former Marakwet East MP John Marirmoi, Pokot South deputy county commissioner Hezron Nyaberi and Marakwet East&rsquo;s Erick Wamulevu. They urged the national and county governments to allocate resources for development.They said high levels of illiteracy and unemployment are to blame for lack of development.Lonyangapuo said, &ldquo;It has been hard to respond to insecurity because the area has bad makeshift roads and there are no vehicles. This makes it hard for security officers to track stolen livestock. We need a helicopter to get rid of cattle rustlers in Muino, Mosop, Kabiego, Tapach and Kipchumo.&rdquo;He urged residents to maintain peace and report criminals to the police.&ldquo;We need a collective effort to maintain peace. We don&rsquo;t want rivalry among MPs, governors and MCAs. We require total commitment to peace,&rdquo; Lonyangapuo said.Marirmoi said leaders will make sure they pursue criminals. &ldquo;We will ensure all stolen animals are recovered,&rdquo;he said. Wamulevu and Nyaberi said police will beef up security.
