So far we have received no complaints from anyone," he said.He asked the party's National Elections Board to publish the names of aspirants early."Reduce the number of polling stations too. The nomination process is not a general election and we should have few polling stations," he said.Read: Aspirants shun ODM over nomination feesAladwa also asked aspirants who are defeated not to complain "for the sake of complaining"."If anybody defeats me during the nomination, I will back him," he said.He asked the IEBC, ODM members and aspirants to ensure the August 8 poll is free and fair for the sake of peace.[VIDEO] Kidero letter exposes rift in Raila partyMore on this: Kidero files complaint against Junet over claims 'he is not best candidate' for Nairobi seat
