Two-time Olympic decathlon champion Ashton Eaton announced his retirement on Wednesday, saying he had given everything he could to the sport.&ldquo;I give everything to the decathlon. I did all I could. Thank u for making it the best time of my life. I&rsquo;m retiring,&rdquo; said Eaton on his Twitter account.The 28-year-old American, who holds the world record in both the decathlon and indoor heptathlon events, won gold in the multi-event discipline at the 2012 London Olympics and successfully defended his crown at the Rio Games last August.&ldquo;Frankly there isn&rsquo;t much more I want to do in sport,&rdquo; said Eaton on his website. &ldquo;I gave the most physically robust years of my life to the discovery and pursuit of my limits in this domain.&ldquo;Did I reach them? Truthfully I&rsquo;m not sure anyone really does. It seems like we tend to run out of time or will before we run out of potential.&rdquo;Eaton walked hand-in-hand into retirement with his wife Brianne Theisen-Eaton who also reached the medals podium in Rio, taking bronze in the heptathlon.The Canadian was also twice a silver medalist at the world championships, finishing runner-up at the 2013 worlds in Moscow and again two years later in Beijing.At the world indoor championships last year in Eaton&rsquo;s hometown of Portland, Oregon, the husband-and-wife team claimed a golden double, each topping the podium in their event.Athletics&rsquo; golden couple had hoped to repeat the feat at the Rio Olympics but Theisen-Eaton was forced to settle for third behind Belgium&rsquo;s Nafissatou Thiam and Britain&rsquo;s Jessica Ennis-Hill.&ldquo;I gave the last four years everything I could. I put my life on hold,&rdquo; said Theisen-Eaton, on the website she shares with her husband. &ldquo;Track and field was the priority before everything else. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve done it.&ldquo;I no longer have the passion for track and field or the heptathlon that I used to because I know I can&rsquo;t advance any further in the sport; I&rsquo;ve given it all I can, and I refuse to come back and half-ass it because I love and respect this event and sport too much.&ldquo;With that, I&rsquo;ve decided to retire.&rdquo;
