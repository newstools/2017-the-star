She dismissed Salat's sentiments as "speculations we don't go by."Salat told Star that party will decided on whether to back President Uhuru Kenyatta's reelection bid or work with the anticipated National Super Alliance."This is an election year and we are going to make a landmark to guide us going forward. It is a crucial meeting that could map out coalition building," Salat said.He pointed out that the political decision to partner with either of the coalitions will be arrived at from two reports to be presented in the meeting.Salat said one report entails KANU's relationship with President Uhuru Kenyatta's Jubilee coalition while the other report captures its relationship with the opposition.Kittony said,"I saw the agenda and we will discuss on elections, party aspirants and the recruitment."She did not confirm if delegates will discuss on punishing Salat from remarks he made that KANU had officially joined NASA during the opposition meeting last Wednesday at Bomas of Kenya.Top KANU officials including the chairman Gideon Moi, members Kittony and West Pokot Senator John Lonyangapuo sent press statements dismissing Salat after making the remarks."You have seen us making a little bid of noise here and there questioning why somebody was representing us. Those are the things we want to iron out today," Kittony said.She added that taking action against the secretary general is "our in-house issue and will be sorted out."
