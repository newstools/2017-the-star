Nanyuki is the latest town to be hit by water shortage, as the country grapples with how to resolve the worsening problem.A notice has been issued to residents. Nanyuki Water and Sanitation Company MD Kennedy Gitonga said the drastic decline in the water levels if the Likii Central River is due to the prevailing dry spell.&ldquo;The company distributes water from the treatment plant located near the Mt Kenya Safari Club and draws its raw water from the Likii River, whose flow has gone down,&rdquo; he said.Gitonga said the plant currently produces 80 litres against the 150 litres demanded by residents. He said this has adversely affected supply, leading to the need for water rationing to allow equitable distribution.&ldquo;We advise our customers to store enough and conserve the available water as we seek alternative sources,&rdquo; Gitonga said.The country has been hit by water shortage, which has been attributed to poor short rains in December.Nairobi residents face a four-month water rationing period due to the decline of water levels in the Ndakaini Dam &ndash; below 50 per cent.The Nairobi Water Company has urged residents to use water sparingly, as rationing is expected to continue until the onset of the long rains, the earliest being March.
