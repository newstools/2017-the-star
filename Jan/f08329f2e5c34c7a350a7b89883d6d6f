Several Rift Valley politicians want Aden Duale to apologise for asking Gideon Moi to support the DP since they supported his father.Duale, who is Garissa Town MP and National Assembly Majority leader, openly attacked Kanu chairman Gideon saying he should brace for a tight contest in the August 8 election.He also said Gideon, who is Baringo Senator, should suport Ruto as the family of General Mahamoud Mohammed lifted Moi when he had nothing.Senator Zipporah Kittony, Tinet MP David Sitienei, Turbo's Shadrack Busienei,Yusuf Chepkwale and Simon Rotich asked him to apologise to former President Daniel Moi's family and Rift valley's people.They said his remarks were disrespectful and that he was not born at the time he said the retired President had nothing."President Moi is a person who loved peace and unity. We are asking Duale to have respect. His statement can cause violence," Kittony said when the leaders issued a statement on Tuesday.Sitienei said a psychiatrist should check whether Duale is mentally fit.Speaking at the burial of former Nominated MP Mark Too that Moi also attended on Monday, Duale told Gideon his party should start packing as it will not win any elective seats."You are praying that Jubilee bungles the nominations process so that you can get at least one seat. You will not succeed," he said."Gideon Moi, sisi tulibeba baba yako kwa mgongo. Sasa ni wakati wako kubeba DP William Ruto kwa mgongo," he added in Kiswahili.This translates to: "We carried your father [retired President Daniel Moi] on our backs. It is now your turn to carry Deputy President William Ruto."Read more: Carry Ruto on your back like your father was carried, Duale tells Gideon Moi
