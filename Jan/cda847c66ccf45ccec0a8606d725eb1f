Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho is edging out perceived threats from his camp as he prepares to face a tough contest in the August polls.Last Thursday, deputy speaker Rashid Mswaba announced that ODM, whose deputy leader is Joho, had ordered the expulsion of some MCAs, who have questioned him or laws made by the House, from the committees. The MCAs are Riziki Fundi (Bamburi), Jabez Oduor (Kongowea), Dan Onyango (Mikindani), Khamisi Mwabashiri (Mjambere) and Caroline Owino (nominated). All the MCAs are ODM members.The party said it wields all powers to expel, appoint and reinstate members in the House committees.This will not only be a do-or-die race for Governor Joho but also a determinant of his political future with 2022 in mind. He has announced his interest in the presidency. Should he lose, analysts say, it will be almost impossible for him to regain his political base in 2022.The Star has learnt that orders to expel the MCAs from all committees was aimed at shelving &ldquo;external interference&rdquo;.ODM claims the MCAs have been flirting with Joho&rsquo;s rivals, a move that reportedly angered the governor.
