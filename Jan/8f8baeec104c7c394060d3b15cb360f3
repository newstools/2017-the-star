Police have dismissed claims that of an imminent al Shabaab attack targeting a learning institution within Nairobi.George Kinoti, in a press statement sent on behalf of Inspector General of Police, affirmed that security officials were on top of things to ensure that peace prevails across the country.The information with the warning was shared on Saturday through a letter said to be from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations."We wish to put it right that the letter is a forgery and information contained in it is false. It is a manifest whose aim is to cause panic and apprehension to the public," Kinoti said.The police have however asked members of the public to remain vigilant and report any suspicious persons or activities to any police station.Read:Al Shabaab planning major attack in Nairobi, DCI claimsThe purported warning came a day after the Kenya Defence Forces lost 9 of its officers in an attack at Kolibyow base in Somalia on Friday.Read: 9 troops, 70 al Shabaab killed in Kolibyow attack- KDFAlso read: KDF denies al Shabaab claim of 66 deaths, working to take back camp
