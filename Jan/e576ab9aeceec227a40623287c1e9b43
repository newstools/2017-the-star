If this world had no laws, there would be absolute chaos and human civilisation would collapse. Likewise, there are also &ldquo;laws of nature&rdquo; for creatures to survive.Over the years, I have observed many people breaking the rules in the park, either pleading total ignorance or just being arrogant, or finding a selfish reason that suits them.At each gate there is a clearly marked sign with the park rules, plus the rules are displayed in many other places, and KWS gives all visitors a copy of the rules at the entrance.It is my observation that over the past 10 years, the number of people visiting the park or driving through has increased dramatically, with a greater need for enforcing rules due to the increase in people in the park.The main violations of the rules are offroad driving, speeding, littering, getting illegally out of vehicle and disturbing the peace.KWS has made the rules for a reason. They do employ staff to discipline offenders, but with the number of visitors ever increasing, it is clear that more help is needed.I appeal to all those who read this to obey the park rules and communicate them to others. When there is no law, the result is chaos. It is always pleasant to visit the park when people are well-behaved. However, apart from our selfish actions and thoughts, the greatest reason by far for needing rules in national parks is to protect the wildlife from human actions, so that animals will behave as naturally as possible. God has created many wonders. Let us observe to conserve.Please keep the rules and report offenders to KWS.
