National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale has said the Opposition does not have any meaningful agenda towards development of the country.Duale said the team coming up with the National Super Alliance (NASA) is only good at discussing individual leaders instead of policies to transform Kenya.The Garissa Township MP told Jubilee delegates at Kasarani on Friday that the Opposition leaders should forget about the August 8 poll and instead strategise for 2022."Instead of discussing issues when they met at Bomas of Kenya, they went ahead to discuss elected leaders namely President Uhuru Kenyatta, DP William Ruto, CS Joseph Nkaissery and myself," Duale said."It was a sad moment for the nation since we all witnessed the disappointment," he said.The MP said Jubilee has already won because of the projects it has initiated since getting into power in March 2013.He further called on opposition leaders to stop inciting Kenyans and tell them what better things they can do for the country."We want a united country and we will achieve this. So, those who are still stuck in the past better move forward or be left out," Duale said.The MP called on Jubilee members to focus past the nominations and specifically concentrate on voter registration to ensure Jubilee wins with a landslide.The opposition met on Wednesday to chart the way forward following Uhuru's decision to sign the controversial Election Laws (Amendment) Act.They announced they will have a single flagbearer who will fight it out with Uhuru during the scheduled poll.More on this: Pray for NASA to solidify, trounce Jubilee, Mudavadi tells Bomas crowdRead: Kanu leaders split on NASA move as Kittony dismisses Salat's 'personal' statementIn his message at the meeting, ODM leader Raila Odinga accused Jubilee of rigging the 2013 election.He asked their supporters to register and vote without fearing that there will be a repeat of such incidences in this year's poll.Read: [STATEMENT] Register, vote without fear of Jubilee rigging - Raila
