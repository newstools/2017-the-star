Cord leaders are concerned about voter importation, distribution of BVR kits, security and high number of uncollected IDs, they said yesterday at the launch of the second phase of mass voter listing in Nairobi.Cord leader Raila Odinga and Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero spoke during the launch at the Kenyatta International Convention Centre.The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission targets to register 6 million voters countrywide.The IEBC targets to register 904,798 new voters in Nairobi. Some 274 BVR kits have been distributed in the 85 wards, based on geographical size.IEBC Nairobi regional coordinator Ruth Kulundu said there was no malice in distributing the kits.Raila, Kidero and the other stakeholders urged the IEBC to guarantee the integrity of the registration.Raila said that while transfer of voters is legal, some leaders abused it in the first phase of voter listing by compelling residents to change constituencies for their own political interest.&ldquo;It is not proper for a leader to be elected by imported voters. That means you are not representing the people who voted for you,&rdquo; he said.Raila urged the government to publish a list of all uncollected ID cards in the county, claiming that the pile-up could be a result of some of them being sent to the &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; stations.&ldquo;We have situations here where we have many ID cards in different centres but some of them do not belong to people from those areas,&rdquo; he said.Raila asked the government to provide security during voter listing and not use security personnel and equipment to scare away voters.Kidero urged city residents to register as voters and exercise their right to choose good leaders.&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t like the way Kenya is run, and you don&rsquo;t vote or make your opinion heard, then you, not the government, is at fault. Remember as the saying goes, bad leaders are voted in by good citizens who don&rsquo;t vote,&rdquo; he said.
