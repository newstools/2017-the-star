The global average for men&rsquo;s height is 5.6 feet while that of women is 5.2 feet.These are well below 8 feet which is the height above which the new LG V20 smartphone is likely to suffer damage if dropped from.The South Korean firm has billed the new phone as the market&rsquo;s toughest build, guaranteeing minimal to no damage resulting from drops at different angles within the above height range.The electronics manufacturer has also added that the phone will require no additional protective covering on account of a light weight, but durable material.The LG V20&rsquo;s uni-body build uses military grade material made for aircrafts, effectively resisting damage, even by accidental drops and knocks.Adding to its break resistant tag, the device adds must-have bells and whistles for the modern smartphone user, such as a wide angle front facing cameras that pushes the boundaries of capturing the ultimate selfie.It adds a High Definition audio recorder with noise cancellation to enhance sound pick up.This makes it an ideal device for professions that require clear audio recording.Retail information on the device in the Kenyan market is as yet unavailable, but LG&rsquo;s regional Marketing General Manager, Moses Marji promises a revolution in smartphone use with the V20.&ldquo;Once in a while our smartphones slip through our fingers and fall, when that happens, your phone had better be LG V20,&rdquo; Marji says, backing the device's ability to withstand rough handling with minimal damage.
