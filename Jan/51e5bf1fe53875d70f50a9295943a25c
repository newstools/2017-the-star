Two Nyanza MPs have faulted the criteria used by the IEBC selection panel to pick commissioners who will supervise the August 8 general election.Nicholas Gumbo (Rarieda) and David Ochieng' (Ugenya) said the process was marred by tribalism, resulting in the marginalisation of communities.The MPs said that they will push for an explanation on the process when the list of members of the new IEBC team is taken to Parliament for debate.Gumbo and Ochieng' accused the Jubilee administration of particularly sidelining the Luo community by giving it a "raw deal on top jobs in the country".The legislators said President Uhuru Kenyatta's regime has been "oiling the wheels of tribalism" and preserving top jobs for two communities.Read: Uhuru nominates Wafula Chebukati as IEBC chairGumbo cited failure by the panel to present names of those who scored high marks in interviews. He pointed out the case of Zephania Aura whose name was not among those presented to Uhuru."Tribalism in this country is more dangerous than terrorism. As leaders, we will not keep quiet when communities are being marginalised," said the Rarieda MP."Why was Aura's name left out yet he beat most of the candidates whose names were presented for nomination?Gumbo further said tribalism is bad, "whether applied backward or forward", and that they have observed that the bias works against Luos in most cases."We demand an explanation for why people from the Luo community cannot be considered even if they are fit for top positions," he said.The MP also claimed that some people are out to ensure that the community does not near any position linked to the management of the election."We are not squatters in Kenya. We are equal to other Kenyans and are entitled to any top position," he said.Ochieng' said the Jubilee government cannot preach peace and then rig the election."Attempts by Jubilee to interfere with the electoral laws are going to be the major causes of lack of peace after elections," the Ugenya MP said.Read: Law doesn&rsquo;t deny Chebukati and Chiloba IEBC jobs &ndash; DualeMore on this: IEBC selection panel meets as integrity queries hit nominees
