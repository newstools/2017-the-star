More than 400,000 Narok county residents face starvation as persistent drought takes a heavy toll.County agricultural officer Bernard Kimeto yesterday said food shortage is a major problem.This was caused by crop failure last year, because the short rains were inadequate in October and November.&ldquo;Residents are in need of food and water, as well as pasture for their livestock,&rdquo; he said.Kimeto said many households will deplete their stock of food in one or two months. Measures must be taken to ensure families do not starve, he said.&ldquo;The situation is worse among pastoralists, who depend only on their livestock to get food. The prices and productivity of their livestock have fallen sharply because of increasing disease outbreaks,&rdquo; he said.Kimeto said Narok had a bumper harvest early last year after the long rains in April, May and June.&ldquo;This is the food the families have been consuming up to now,&rdquo; he said.Kimeto called for urgent intervention. Bernard Njau from the Veterinary department said the prolonged drought has also led to outbreak of livestock diseases.He said the department needs about Sh100 million for vaccination but to date it has received only Sh1 million from the National Drought Management Authority. Njau said that amount can help only the worst-hit areas. He said livestock migration to neighbouring counties, such as Bomet and Nakuru, is on the rise.Njau attributed this to inadequate pasture and water, especially in the pastoral and agro-pastoral zones near the upper parts of Mau. He said this fuels spread of livestock diseases.The Narok County Steering Group, which is made up of representatives of government departments, urged the national and county governments to emphasise disaster preparedness. It urged education on how residents can avert weather-related risks.
