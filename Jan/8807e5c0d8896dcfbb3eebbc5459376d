Tourism Cabinet Secretary Najib Balala has criticised the US for issuing travel advisories against Kenya on January 13.The US banned its citizens from travelling to Mandera, Wajir, Garissa, Tana River and Lamu, including areas north of Malindi in Kilifi county, and Nairobi's Eastleigh estate.On Friday, he accused the US and other western countries of applying double standards on matters of terrorism. He was speaking to the press on the sidelines of the opening of the Sh3.1 billion Paradise Inn Hotel at Shanzu, Mombasa.&ldquo;When incidents happen in US, France or Belgium, we are being told to stand up with these countries in solidarity to fight the dark forces, but if it happens to Africa, they come to evacuate their people,&rdquo; Balala said. It is very unfortunate, but we will move on.&rdquo; Balala said it is unfortunate that partners like the US issue travel warnings every three months and in a manner that portrays Kenya as a hotbed of terror.He said the tourism industry is usually the hardest when advisories are issued, adding Kenya loses millions in foreign revenues.&ldquo;Tourism is the economy of our people, and if you embargo our economy, then you are our enemy and not our friend,&rdquo; Balala said.
