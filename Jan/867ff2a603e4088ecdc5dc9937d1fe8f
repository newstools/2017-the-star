The Siaya government will supplement the national cash transfer programme with Sh9 million. The programme caters for 450 elderly people &mdash; all biometrically registered. Each will receive Sh2,000 a month from January 25, Social Services director Sanmac Okoth said.&ldquo;The programme targets households that are identified based on the level of vulnerability. The number of beneficiaries has grown, which demonstrates the absolute necessity of the programme,&rdquo; he said.Okoth addressed journalists at his office on Wednesday. He said the 450 beneficiaries will be mobilised for identification and biometric registration. They will also be issued with smart cards (Uzima cards) at the subcounty headquarters.&ldquo;KCB has the biometric system that scans and saves the beneficiaries&rsquo; fingerprints during registration. Beneficiaries can then access their dues only if their fingerprints match the registered individual,&rdquo; Okoth said.
