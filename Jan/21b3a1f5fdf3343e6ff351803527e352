The temperature is high &ndash; and rising &ndash; as both political sides of the divide gear up for the Mother of all Elections in Kenya, in my view.Kenyans have heard from their leaders and absorbed what they think is best for them, depending on which side of the political divide they identify with.In my analysis, one side comes off hopeful and ready to meet 2017 well, while the other side spells out gloom. True, there have been challenges, but we should also learn to highlight the successes as we work on our mistakes.My expectation of the leaders &ndash; incumbents and aspirants &ndash; in this country is that they preach a sense of unity under a shared vision. Our diversity should not be our point of departure, where I see myself as more Kenyan than my neighbour. Dear leaders, our fathers and mother with the moneybags, let us be cautious what we sell to our youth.These messages really get into the heads of our youth, who are misled to believe it is because of so and so I am unemployed, I am broke, I do not drive and many more inadequacies. From that the next thought is too often that, &ldquo;Once we do away with the enemy my life will be much better&rdquo;.Dear brethren, it is not your neighbours&rsquo; fault you are unemployed: your neighbors&rsquo; child is your mate at the base where you catch up as a catharsis to the overbearing life we lead. So how has he or she become the enemy?The youth are the custodians of Vision 2030: It will be realized in the prime of our lives and the future will judge us harshly when our children ask us, &lsquo;What did you do?&rsquo; Of course, children of the Mau Mau fighters are proud their parents fought for Independence &ndash; but what about us?My expectation is that no youth will allow himself or herself to engage in violence &ndash; for any leader. The President has assured Kenyans of a free and fair election. Your role is to register as a voter, aspire as a candidate, and why not; Kenya needs a new way of doing things, a new style, sense of urgency; wit and a touch of class which is a true representation of Kenya&rsquo;s youth today.
