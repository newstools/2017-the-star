Kilifi Speaker Jimmy Kahindi has reported the withdrawal of his security under unclear circumstances, barelydays after that of two Coast governors was taken away.The government withdrew the security detail of Governors Amason Kingi (Kilifi) and Mombasa's Hassan Joho on Friday, without a clear explanation.Kahindi told the Star that his security officer was called at 4pm on Sunday and ordered to surrender his firearm in Malindi, and "wait for further orders from above".In a telephone interview, he said the officer was with him at his Mariakani home in Kilifi county when the orders were relayed. "I had only one security officer at the time he was called. So far, I have not been contacted by any authority," he said.Kahindi said the issue of withdrawal of his security seems to be part of a scheme targeting Kilifi leaders, which lacks justification.The Speaker noted his colleagues countrywide have their security detail intact, therefore it beat logic for his to be withdrawn.But Kahindi said he would let the government to do what it deemed fit."At the end of the day, we are all under the mercy of God. The person who made the call to recall the security must have had reasons which are not known to me," he said."If he or she feels it is necessary for me to have my security back, they will return. I will not contest the decision. I am keen on delivering my mandate to the public."But Kilifi county commander Wachira Mathenge said he was not aware that the Speaker's security had been taken away.Kingi and Joho's security was withdrawn on Saturday resulting in protest by ODM leaders and governors alike.State House spokesman Manoah Esipisu said the decision was not political, in response to claims that the action was taken after Joho criticised President Uhuru Kenyatta over Coast projects.IG Joseph Boinnet said the withdrawal was part of an operation that will not affect other counties but he did not give details.Read: Joho, Kingi security withdrawal 'purely coincidental', says BoinnetAlso read: ODM leaders ask Nkaissery to reinstate Joho, Kingi security detail
