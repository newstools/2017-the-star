Garissa Township MP Aden Duale has scoffed at leaders who have reject the proposed line-up that brings together the Abdalla and Abdwak clans called &lsquo;Telamuge&rsquo;.Several leaders, including Garissa Deputy Governor Abdullahi Hussein, have dismissed the &lsquo;shared&rsquo; county seats, saying it is an &ldquo;insult to the electorate&rdquo;. Hussein said the declaration was selfish of some senior politicians keen to protect their interests at the expense of the community.But speaking to the press in Garissa town on Monday, Duale said such arrangements are practised worldwide and Garissa is not an exception.&ldquo;It is unfortunate that individuals opposing this are not seeing the larger picture, which is to unite the communities living in Garissa county,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They are simply opposing this because it did not favour them politically as they would have wished.&rdquo;Duale said the essence of the pact was to build an all-inclusive government representing all the communities. During a meeting held in a Nairobi hotel &ndash; attended by political and religious leaders, the business community and the youth &ndash; it was agreed Ali Korane would vie for governor, while Senator Yusuf Haji will defend his seat. Annab Subow will contest for woman representative.
