Most ODM officials eyeing elective posts are yet to resign, despite a directive from the party. Chairman John Mbadi directed the officials to resign before the party primaries. He said the officials are expected to relinquish their positions at least two months to the primaries, and the law only exempts the national officials. However, most officials say they are waiting for the National Elections Board to announce the nominations date. Homa Bay ODM chairperson Gladys Wanga, who is defending her woman representative post, said the party constitution requires officials to step aside 30 days before nomination date. &ldquo;We expect all office-bearers from the county who have an interest in elective posts to step aside when the time comes,&rdquo; she said. When the time comes, she will resign, Wanga said.Other county officials who have shown their interest in elective seats are secretary Oyugi Magwanga and vice chairman Hamilton Orata.
