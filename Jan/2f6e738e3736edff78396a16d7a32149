The electoral agency is finally a complete commission. The seven commissioners of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission, including the chairman, were approved by Parliament in its special sitting yesterday.The IEBC has a number of priorities and very little time in which to do a thorough job acceptable to all Kenyans &ndash; just seven months to Election Day August 8.The first priority is a clean voter&rsquo;s register at the end of the final national mass registration of voters. This must be done properly and to the satisfaction of all players and their constituencies.Also every bit as urgent and sensitive as a clean register is the procurement of polling ICTs and the training of their operators. And this must be done in a thoroughly transparent process that is absolutely aboveboard and gives Kenya value for money.At every turn of its priority deliverables, the IEBC needs to build and win Kenyans&rsquo; confidence in its personnel, systems and procedures.
