A year after their home burnt down, a family in Eshirumbwe village, Kakamega, is out in the cold again after strong winds blew off their new roof. Joseph Odhiambo and Vivian Aketch (pictured) lost a child in the fire in January last year. Another was hospitalised for eight months. Neighbours helped them to rebuild their home. “It is worrying that three months since I came back from hospital [with her child], another calamity has hit again. I ... appeal to everybody to pray for us,” Aketch said.
