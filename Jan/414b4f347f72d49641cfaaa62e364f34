The West Pokot government has bought 6,000 bags of maize for famine-stricken families. Speaking at Kapenguria town when disbursement started yesterday, Governor Simon Kachapin said his administration will buy food during harvest time at a lower price and distribute it during calamities. He warned politicians against politicising hunger, and instead assist those affected. “We will not be biased in distributing the food. People in Ombolion, Turkwel, Masol and Kamuligon will get their share. Let us put our political differences aside and help save the lives of the people,” Kachapin said. He said the county has pumped a lot of funds in the agriculture sector to help residents produce their own food. The county has bought 200 generators for small-scale farmers living along River Suam, Turkwel and Muruny to irrigate their farms. “Buying food for residents is a short-term measure. The generators will help farmers produce food for subsistence and the surplus will be sold,” he said. Kachapin urged donors to provide aid for children and women, who are the most affected.
