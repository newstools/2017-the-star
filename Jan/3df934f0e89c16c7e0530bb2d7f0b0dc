The NCIC has said recording gadgets to tame hatemongers will soon be distributed nationwide.Chairman Francis ole Kaparo yesterday in Mombasa, said the devices have been purchased after completion of the tendering process.The commission boss said hate speech leads to ethnic profiling, a dangerous situation that threatens to plunge the country in another wave of violence.&ldquo;The period is so delicate that any action that can cause death or destruction of property must be firmly dealt with,&rdquo; he said.National Intelligence Service and the NCIC sleuths are going to be issued with the gadgets that includes a camera and camcorders.This announcement comes when the commission is facing intense pressure from the public to stamp out hatemongers. It has been bashed for allegedly targeting only opposition politicians and turning a blind eye when pro-government officials are found culpable.Kenyans have voiced concern that only the powerless have successfully been prosecuted and those wielding powers are roaming free.Kaparo said 24 cases related to hate speech, which involves influential figures are nearing completion. None will be spared, he said. &ldquo;Some cases are at various levels of hearing, with others awaiting judgement,&rdquo; Kaparo said.Machakos Senator Johnson Muthama and woman representatives Florence Mutua (Busia) and Aisha Jumwa (Kilifi) are facing hate speech charges. Others are MPs Moses Kuria (Gatundu South), Kimani Ngunjiri (Bahati) and Ferdinand Waititu (Kabete), Junet Mohamed (Suna East) and Timothy Bosire (Kitutu Masaba).Kaparo said this electioneering period has been characterised by fear and intimidation propagated by politicians. &ldquo;We will not fail to act on them. Elections come and go, but the nation remains,&rdquo; he said.He said the level of politicking attached to the ongoing mass voter registration is unprecedented and warned of worse scenario if the tempo is not be checked. &ldquo;Temperatures are high and need to be contained. Politicians should be mindful of the consequences of their actions,&rdquo; Kaparo said.Both Jubilee and Cord have put up spirited campaigns to mobilise voters to register.
