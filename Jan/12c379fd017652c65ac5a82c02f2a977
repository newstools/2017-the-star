Pan-African housing financier Shelter Afrique will take action against top managers linked to massive looting of funds through creative accounting and subprime lending at the company, the board said yesterday.This follows an audit report by Deloitte, presented to the board this month, which has revealed malpractices in the running of the company&rsquo;s business.The company&rsquo;s managing director, James Mugerwa, came under the spotlight last year for giving mortgages to individuals with poor credit histories, resulting in a steep rise in the company&rsquo;s non-performing loans.The management had also been accused of presiding over a creative accounting regime that subdued provisions for bad loans, and refused to provide sufficient impairment for $4.1 million (Sh145.7 million) Shelter Afrique had in the collapsed Chase Bank.In a statement yesterday, the board said the findings of the audit have revealed there were notes made to manipulate the system, &ldquo;resulting in misalignment of the systems to the strategic and tactical goals of Shelter Afrique&rdquo;.&ldquo;Through the Ad Hoc Committee, the board intends to ensure that responsible officers are held accountable through appropriate disciplinary measures,&rdquo; said Jean-Paul Missi (Cameroun), non-executive chairman of the board and the chairman of the Ad Hoc Committee for Implementation of the recommendations of the final report.&ldquo;The board will ensure that where the final report has indicated the dereliction of duties with respect to the financial statements by responsible officers and external advisers &ndash; including the former head of finance (Godfrey Waweru) &ndash; they will be held accountable through appropriate measures&rdquo;.
