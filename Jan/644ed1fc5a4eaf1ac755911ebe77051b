The alarm clock buzzed at 0430hrs as we awoke to a new day. We packed the car and arrived at the gate just after 0600hrs.The masterplan was to spend the entire day in the park and just enjoy all of creation, from the smallest to the largest creatures. Well, I have to say it was an amazing day, as our plan manifested into a wonderful reality. As we drove along slowly, there were many natural rewards, with wonderful observations of the many different species that occur in the park.So if you are planning your very own family day in the park, I believe the following basic tips could make your day together really fantastic. One, try to pre-plan your food and drinks in advance. Two, use a cooler box with ice packs to keep food and drinks fresh and cold. Three, wake up early for a game drive. Four, stop at a picnic site for a meal together. Five, pack a good set of binoculars. Six, pack a map and some basic ID books on various species. Seven, carry a decent camera. It helps to enhance the experience as you can capture some of your sightings in the form of photos. Eight, don&rsquo;t travel too much. Take time to sit and relax at various dams and treed areas. Nine, don&rsquo;t worry about finding lions first. Rather, focus on enjoying every species and then if a lion sighting happens, it will be a special bonus. Ten, slow down to the pace of nature and relax! The tranquil peace in the park is tangible and real. Indeed, a day in the park is a real &ldquo;soul tonic&rdquo;; medicine for the inner being, an escape from the fast-paced world around us.
