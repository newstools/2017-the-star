Kirinyaga politicians&rsquo; meddling in state projects stalled construction of a mega dam to supply more water to the Mwea irrigation scheme, President Uhuru Kenyatta has said.The government will not tolerate those interfering with plans to improve the scheme, he said in Kirinyaga county.&ldquo;I will come back to Mwea and we will hold a meeting where those who have been blocking this project will be named,&rdquo; Uhuru said. The government has allocated funds to improve the scheme and compensate those displaced by the dam. Some Sh4.1 billion has been paid to those displaced, while Sh696 million has been paid to those whose land will be used for irrigation canals. The state has also acquired 350 acres to resettle those who have been displaced.
