Embu Deputy Governor Dorothy Nditi (pictured) has abandoned her boss Governor Martin Wambora and teamed up with his rival Senator Lenny Kivuti.She is running for woman representative. Nditi has recently been joining Kivuti in his campaigns and political activities. Their camp has intensified their onslaught on Wambora.She has not, however, been directly criticising Wambora and his administration. Kivuti and his campaigners have accused Wambora of failing the county.Nditi accompanied Kivuti when he opened a parallel Jubilee Party office in Embu Town on January 16, after the party&rsquo;s election flopped. The JP national headquarters recognised a list compiled by other party governor contestants &mdash; Wambora, Runyenjes MP Cecily Mbarire and Kithinji Kiragu.During the meeting, Nditi, without mentioning names, criticised the governor, Mbarire, Kiragu and Manyatta MP John Muchiri. Nditi said they met secretly and handpicked interim party officials without involving other leaders.She said many hopefuls who were to participate in the polls were locked out. The polls failed as violence erupted. The Wambora camp presented its list to the party headquarter and was accepted. Nditi said the camp&rsquo;s decision was undemocratic and selfish.
