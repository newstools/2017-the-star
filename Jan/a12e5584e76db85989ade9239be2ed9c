Drought in various parts of Naivasha has been blamed for the increase in human-wildlife conflict cases. Hundreds of wild animals have in the past two months fled from various game parks and ranches, with Hells Gate and Mt Longonot parks being the most affected. According to Naivasha subcounty commissioner Isaac Masinde, harsh weather conditions have also adversely affected the livestock. He said many animals are at risk of dying if it doesn&rsquo;t rain soon. They are, however, closely monitoring the situation. &ldquo;We currently have seen an increase in the number of wild animals, mainly buffaloes and zebras, fleeing from their habitat to farms and estates in search of water and pastures,&rdquo; Masinde said. He said the most affected areas are Ndabibi, Karati, Longonot, Kongoni, Kasarani and Moi Ndabi, where farmers have incurred heavy losses.
