Use water sparingly, supply is dwindling, Kisumu residents have been urged. The area received inadequate rainfall last year and is experiencing a dry spell.The Kisumu Water and Sewerage Company said the level of water in one of two sources has dropped drastically. &ldquo;Kiwasco abstracts water from two sources &ndash; River Kibos and Lake Victoria. Currently the water level in River Kibos has dropped significantly, forcing the company to reduce production at the Kajulu treatment plant,&rdquo; MD David Onyango said.Residents have complained of irregular supply, which has left them at the mercy of water vendors. Onyango said some of the worst-hit areas include ADASA, Chiga, Gita, Kanyamedha, Kibos market, Kotunga, Kunya, parts of Nyamasaria, Otonglo, Rarieda and Tiengre. &ldquo;Affected customers are advised to store water and use it sparingly,&rdquo; he said. Onyango urged residents to be cautious when buying water. He said the company has put in place measures to manage the low water supply. Elsewhere, Awasi residents have called for a permanent solution to the perennial water shortage. Most residents wake up as early as 3am to queue to fetch water from a borehole. Eunice Nanjala from Ponge said the borehole sunk by the Ogra Foundation is not enough to end the shortage. Women, youths and even the elderly have been forced to queue for water. &ldquo;I came at 6am and by 9am I was still in [the queue]. More water points should be placed at different sites in Awasi to avoid the long distance women travel to get water,&rdquo; resident Consolata Anyango said.The country received little rainfall last year. Some parts are experiencing a drought. Last year, it was announced that 1.3 million Kenyans face starvation. Domestic animals are dying in some parts of the country.
