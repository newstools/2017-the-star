He said he had walked the international court's 39 times, and "I know &nbsp;ICC in and out... I know the law and the prosecutors". The majority leader, who is also Garissa Town MP, said his enemies faked an audio clip&nbsp;to tarnish his name. "They went out and made a clip to use against me," he said, noting he had asked the CID to look into the audio. Kalonzo threatened to write to the ICC over Duale&rsquo;s purported incitement remarks. He said it was contradictory for Duale to claim Jubilee was fighting tribalism yet the widely-circulated recording is of someone inciting youths to attack the Kamba community in Garissa as the August 8 polls near. Duale dismissed the clip as "concocted propaganda" and said it was corrupted.&nbsp; He recorded a statement at the DCI a day later.
