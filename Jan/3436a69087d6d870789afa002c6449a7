Lake Kenyatta, one of Kenya&rsquo;s oldest natural fresh water lakes, is drying up leaving behind a trail of death. The situation threatens the livelihoods of thousands of people and places the survival of rare wildlife at risk.Located on the northern coast of Kenya, 230km north of Malindi and 60km from Lamu Island, the lake covers an area of 496km2 .Named after the country&rsquo;s founding father and first president, Lake Kenyatta may soon go dry if action is not taken following the deadly effects caused by encroachment by both human beings and animals.TOURIST ATTRACTION Ten years ago, it was a natural lake full of beauty, a major attraction for nature lovers and tourists, who will soon have nowhere to go.The lake used to be home to some of the world&rsquo;s unique birds species that flock the area due to the conducive climate and biodiversity.During its heydays, Lake Kenyatta was home to hundreds of hippos who lived and bred in the waters together with thousands of fresh water snails that lived freely in the lake.While on a fact-finding mission, environmentalists and stakeholders concerned by the situation came face to face with the effects of the destruction of the lake two weeks ago.More than 15 hippo carcasses lay on the drying lake bed while shells of thousands of dead snails were all over the dry areas.When the lake was at its best, it covered a stretch of 3.7 square kilometres but today what remains is less than 1.5 square kilometres and it is still shrinking.The disaster is not only worrying conservationists but has now become a collective tragedy for all ranging from the county government, national government, and the locals who entirely depend on it for their livelihood.Lamu Governor Issa Timmamy and his deputy Eric Mugo recently led a delegation including environmentalists from the World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF) and the Lake Kenyatta Water Users Association among others on a tour of the area and got a rude shock seeing the remaining part of the lake.Timammy said the lake was shrinking at an alarming rate and rated it as the most threatened natural resource in the county.The governor said the biggest challenge to the lake was the waterways, which used to feed the lake. They have since been interfered with by humans and animals.&ldquo;Human beings are growing rice in the waterways and wetlands, while cattle in their thousands, come to drink water from the lake every day,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said.Timammy said it was for that reason the county government in conjunction with WWF and stakeholders from Mpeketoni and the surrounding locations, came together to see for themselves the extent of the degradation. Last year, Water and irrigation Cabinet Minister Eugene Wamalwa visited the area to look for a solution to the problem.WATER FLOW IMPEDIMENTSThe governor said it was a pity that a lake which has existed for hundreds of years could dry up because of human interference.Lake Kenyatta is a landlocked water resource and entirely depends on other sources to survive.It appears that farmers who encroached one of the key waterways in Mukuru, began farming activities making it difficult for water to flow to the lake, Timammy said.Even the lake breather is unable to supply water today.The governor said that during the drought season, cattle from Tana River, Lamu and Garissa counties flock the lake to drink water, a problem that could have contributed to the disaster.The lake serves more than 65,000 people not only in Mpeketoni but also in adjacent areas bordering the lake.&ldquo;It is sad to see such a crucial resource in the verge of extinction, the destruction will no longer be tolerated,&rdquo; Timammy said.During a recent stakeholder meeting organised by WWF, top of the agenda were deliberations on various ways of rehabilitating the lake to bring back its lost glory.John Bett, the WWF acting coastal Kenya programme manager revealed that people invaded the wetlands and continue to practice farming in the area which used to feed the lake with water.Bett said although many people in from Mpeketoni to Mkunubi depend on the lake for survival, little was being done to conserve the resource.Each year, he said, about four million cattle drink water from the lake, which makes it the most reliable lake in the county.CONSERVATION EFFORTSThe WWF coastal manager said the urgent short-term measure to save the lake is to fence the area surrounding it to reduce the influx of cattle that cause siltation.He said there is also need to find a way of gazetting the lake, which will help in addressing the water insecurity.Lamu Governor says there is need for the Kenya Wildlife Service to do research and find out if there could be other reasons why the hippos are dying, apart from the drying wells.Some believe that the herbicides and pesticides used by farmers and pastoralists could have contaminated the lake and led to the death of the hippos.CHALLENGES AND EFFECTSBenson Kariuki, chairman of Lake Kenyatta Water Users Association, who are controlling a Sh80 million water project done by Coast Water Service Board to supply water to over 5000 residents, said they have had challenges in the last eight years.After the El-Nino rains, the lake&rsquo;s water levels rose to 12 metres. However, the chairman now says the levels have gone down drastically.&ldquo;The water turned salty due to salinity. Hippos can no longer be sustained in the lake, even the fish are having problems. We urge the national and county government to intervene demarcate the lake and protect it,&rdquo; he said.The effects of the drying lake are evident, ranging from soil erosion, and the ever increasing reduction of water space that is now on the verge of extinction.Previously, Kariuki said, the lake used to have a depth of more than four metres. Today, the depth is less than two metres.&ldquo;Even the hippos have difficulties living in the remaining part of the lake, which is too shallow. Many areas, which once hosted the hippos, are now dry or the fresh water has turned salty,&rdquo; he said.A local tycoon also reportedly grabbed 10 acres of land along the lake that was previously used for tree nursery.Fishermen are also facing a rough time. They get it rough whenever they go fishing in the remaining part of the lake.Mohamed Abdalla, a father of three who has been fishing in Lake Kenyatta for over 15 years, says nowadays they are forced to scramble for space with hippos who also want to survive.Previously, he said, there were over 40 fishermen in the lake but the number has reduced drastically due to the threats.&ldquo;Go and tell the government to open the water channels, which were feeding this lake, if they are committed to save it,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said.
