Kanu members are split over remarks made by secretary general Nick Salat at Bomas of Kenya that the independence party will join hands with the Opposition during the August poll.While Salat stated that the Kenya African National Union was fully part of the National Super Alliance (NASA), NEC member Ziporah Kittony dismissed the assertions as 'personal'.She said Salat's statement does not reflect the party's position on which political outfit it will join hands with ahead of the August 8 general election.Read: Opposition forms alliance in unity bid before August election Kittony said Kanu's policies and decisions are guided by its constitution which stipulates that such resolutions must first be discussed by the national delegates congress.She said that Kanu supports the idea of opposition parties coming together in efforts to field one candidate, as that is "a milestone for Kenya's growing democracy"."However, the remarks made by Hon Nick Salat at the Bomas of Kenya are his personal sentiments. They do not reflect in any way the position of the party on the matter of an election coalition at this juncture," Kittony said.According to the nominated senator, the remarks by the Secretary General were therefore not official since the party had not convened the congress as required by its constitution."...as they have not been subjected to the internal constitutional processes for ratification," Kittony said.During the charged Bomas meeting, Salat - who was one of the speakers - said that Kanu was fully behind the formation of the alliance and will live by the resolutions of the meeting."Mimi kama katibu mkuu wa KANU nawahakikishia kwamba tuko ndani kabisaa (As the sec Gen of KANU i want to assure you that we are fully part of NASA)," Salat said. NASA is an outfit that brings key opposition parties namely ODM, Wiper, Ford-K, and Amani together ahead of the vote.Leaders Raila Odinga, Kalonzo Musyoka, Moses Wetang'ula and Musalia Mudavadi are part of the coalition that is positioning itself to fight it out with Jubilee Party (JP) during the poll.JP has fronted President Uhuru Kenyatta, who will be defending his seat for a second term in office, as its candidate.Uhuru has steered the country since the March 4, 2013 general election.Also read: Bomas rally: I am ready to sacrifice presidency again, Kalonzo saysMore on this: Pray for NASA to solidify, trounce Jubilee, Mudavadi tells Bomas crowd
