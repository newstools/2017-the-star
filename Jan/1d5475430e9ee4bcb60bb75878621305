President Uhuru Kenyatta and all the 47 governors are to blame for the ongoing doctors&rsquo; strike, which has led to the deaths of many Kenyans and left others suffering.Mombasa Senator Hassan Omar and his Makueni counterpart Mutula Kilonzo Jnr accused the two levels of government of doing little to resolve the health crisis since December 5.They supported the doctors&rsquo; demand for full implementation of the 2013 collective bargaining agreement.The senators argued that not enough is being done to negotiate around the commitments provided for in the CBA.&ldquo;It is unacceptable that commitments or undertakings agreed to by President Uhuru Kenyatta as part of the earlier return-to-work formula have not been honoured todate,&rdquo; Omar said.They said Uhuru was part of the agreement on December12, 2011, which he is fully aware of the commitments made to doctors and it is in bad faith to dishonour the CBA and challenge its legality.&ldquo;It is a dishonest attempt to defraud the doctors of what was legitimately negotiated,&rdquo; they said .The senate as the guardian of devolution with health being a devolved function plans to convene a joint stakeholders &lsquo; forum for all parties in a bid to end the strike.Omar said the national and county governments must propose a framework for the implementation of this progressive CBA which also talks about comprehensive reforms in the public health sector besides the higher pay.&ldquo;The end to the strike must be about negotiations, not arm-twisting and intimidation. No county government should threaten or purport to sack its doctors,&rdquo; Kilonzo said as he rejected talk of having Indian doctors to replace the striking doctors.The two senators also took a swipe at eth e court&rsquo;s threats to jail the striking workers saying this will not solve the problem.The courts must be progressive in defining a path towards the resolution of this crisis, the senators said and added that they will join a legal team representing doctors unions officials to avert a possibility of imprisonment for contempt.
