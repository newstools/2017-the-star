Barely seven months to the next general election, the ICC ghost once again rears its head, probably at the most inopportune time in the history of the Republic of Kenya.News that the court has launched fresh investigations into the collapsed cases on Kenya is definitely a shocker, particularly as regards the motive of such action at this time.The manner in which the cases against four Kenyans collapsed left little doubt that they could be revisited in future.According to Chief Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda, the cases collapsed because of massive interference with witnesses through the connivance of the Kenyan state.In terminating the cases, the court left the gate open, suggesting that the prosecutor could take back the cases if and when sufficient evidence was gathered. In other words, the Kenyan cases are still open and susceptible to fresh investigations with a view of getting the culprits on trial.And what better way than to start with investigations into the witness tampering that facilitated the collapse of the cases involving all four Kenyans in the first place?There are already three pending summons that could be a perfect launch pad in the event that investigations are restarted into the cases.In the last two years, the court has issued arrest warrants against three Kenyans suspected to have been part of the enterprise that undermined the trials by influencing witnesses.A fresh probe raises several pertinent issues on the accumulated matter of the ICC and its relationship with Kenya.Bensouda has constantly accused the government of failing to meet its international obligations under the Rome Statute, especially insofar as cooperation with the court is concerned.Uhuru and Ruto, both suspects in the collapsed cases, are still in charge of the state in Kenya, and this raises questions about the authenticity of the claims underlying this 'fresh probe'.Does the fresh probe by any chance suggest that the UhuRuto Administration is finally cooperating with the court? If yes - for what purpose?It is doubtful that after their hair-thin escape the Dynamic Duo would happily enmesh themselves in the same imbroglio they fought so hard to extricate themselves from. The President, while presiding over the national prayers in Nakuru after Ruto&rsquo;s acquittal, declared that no other Kenyan will ever be tried at the ICC. By allowing this &lsquo;fresh probe&rsquo; has that position changed?
