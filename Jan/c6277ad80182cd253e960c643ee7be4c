Deputy President William Ruto (pictured) yesterday asked leaders to stop politicising the choice of the new Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission commissioners.Ruto said leaders should not look at the new commissioners from a tribal perspective, but as professionals.The DP said it is unfortunate that some leaders are questioning the choice of Wafula Chebukati as IEBC chairman simply because he is from the same county - Trans Nzoia - as IEBC chief executive Ezra Chiloba.He said despite the process of appointment involving the opposition, some leaders are questioning the process. Ruto said Chebukati and Chiloba were not given the opportunity to serve because they hailed from Western but because they are professionals and up to the task. &ldquo;Kenyans should look at the commissioners from a perspective of qualifications and performance and not on the perspective of tribe and the counties they hail from,&rdquo; Ruto said.He addressed a delegation of leaders from Lugari, Malava and Likuyani constituencies in Kakamega county at his Sugoi home in Uasin Gishu county. The DP said some leaders are reading politics in every step taken to reform the IEBC. Malava MP Malulu Injendi and local leaders led the delegation. Turbo MP Elijah Busienei and Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago were present. &ldquo;The selection panel followed due process in selecting the commissioners and we should accept the outcome of the process,&rdquo; Ruto said.He said the opposition&rsquo;s objection to the list of commissioners is an indication it does not want anything done smoothly.
