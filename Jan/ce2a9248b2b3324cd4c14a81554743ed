Siaya residents should vote for a governor from a poor background because he will understand their struggles and develop the county, politician William Oduol has said.He said he is willing to shelve his bid for governor if a better candidate, who is progressive, is identified.Oduol said Siaya has lagged behind compared to regions such as Machakos with fewer resources. He spoke at Ndori market in Rarieda constituency on Monday during a voter listing drive.In a thinly veiled remark against incumbent Cornel Rasanga, Oduol said leaders raised with milk and honey cannot understand the people&rsquo;s suffering.&ldquo;I was raised by a grandmother, who made a living by making mats, so I know what suffering is,&rdquo; he said. Oduol will run on the ODM ticket.He urged residents to register and vote to increase Cord leader Raila Odinga&rsquo;s chances of winning.Oduol urged residents to vote out leaders with selfish interests. He said Rasanga has not launched any major project since taking office.&ldquo;He has resorted to taking credit for projects funded by the national government. Look at the street lighting project. It is a World Bank project. The tarmacked roads are sponsored by the national government,&rdquo; Oduol said.He said Rasanga has only repaired feeder roads, &ldquo;which have not even been done to the bitumen standards&rdquo;.&ldquo;Why open many ECDE and ill-equipped health centres?&rdquo; Oduol said.He dismissed rumours he plans to be Rarieda MP Nicholas Gumbo&rsquo;s running mate.Siaya senator James Orengo is expected to run, though he is yet to officially declare interest in the seat.Last Saturday, he said the opposition&rsquo;s focus is on campaigning for Raila.
