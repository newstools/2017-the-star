The electoral commission has urged the government to lift ban on the International Foundation for Electoral Systems operations in Kenya as it could have a negative impact on election preparedness.Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission CEO Ezra Chiloba, who spoke during a media forum on voter registration yesterday, said IFES has been constructive in funding the commission&rsquo;s key operations among them voter education.&ldquo;We have had a very constructive engagement with IFES for a very long time,&rdquo; he said.President Uhuru Kenyatta accused some NGOs of plotting to undermine the government under the guise of promoting civic education.At the time, Uhuru said Kenyans know how to vote. Days later, the government stopped the operations of IFES, claiming it was operating in Kenya illegally and directed the Central Bank of Kenya to freeze its accounts. However, the High Court suspended the government directive pending determination of the case.The US-based organisation has been instrumental in funding key electoral programmes, among them civic education, training of the IEBC officers and media, advocacy and election coordination.
