Election fraud at the Coast will not happen under the watchful eye of the opposition, two Coast governors have said. Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho and his Kilifi counterpart Amason Kingi said on Tuesday their supporters will physically guard polling stations. They said they will implement the adopt-a-polling-station strategy suggested by Cord leader Raila Odinga.Raila (pictured) said the strategy was employed in Ghana in the general election last December. He alleged Jubilee plans to rig the August 8 polls using the National Intelligence Service and others .Raila said the adopt-a-polling-station strategy will ensure there is o rigging in all 44,000 polling stations in the country. In Ghana, former President John Mahama was defeated by Opposition chief Nana Akufo-Addo.Raila said Akufo-Addo was rigged in 2008 and in 2012, but after employing the adopt-a-polling-strategy in Ghana&rsquo;s 28,992 polling stations, the opposition won fair and square. He urged his Mombasa and Kilifi supporters to adopt polling stations by sponsoring agents, buying them food and supporting their movements. &ldquo;Each polling station should have at least 58 people to guard our votes at the August 8 election. We will employ the strategy to ensure our votes are protected,&rdquo; Raila said.He spoke in Mtwapa, Kilifi , where he urged residents to register en masse to vote. Joho said they have received applications from people who will sponsor the exercise.&ldquo;We urge other regions to do the same, as it does not cost much to cater for the expenses of the people who will guard our votes,&rdquo; he said.
