President Uhuru Kenyatta has been praised for disbanding the 61-person national campaign team that critics said was unfairly chosen and stacked with favourites.Kiambu Governor William Kabogo, a vocal critic, said its members, including incumbents and aspirants, appeared to have the endorsement of Uhuru and Deputy President William Ruto.Uhuru unveiled the team to lead his reelection bid in the eight former provinces in November last year. But he bowed to mounting criticism and disbanded the team at Kasarani Stadium on Friday, when he launched the Jubilee membership smart card. He gave every JP aspirant the feel-good mandate to campaign for him. On Monday Kabogo said this was a wise move. He spoke at Redhill, Limuru, during an inspection of county government projects and a meet-the-people tour. &ldquo;The President was looking for a way to go, but his idea of incorporating each and every candidate in his campaign was wise since each candidate will work hard to ensure people surrounding them vote for Uhuru,&rdquo; Kabogo said.&ldquo;The move will also help residents elect a person of their own choice.&rdquo; Kabogo is seeking reelection. His closest challenger is Kabete MP Ferdinand Waititu.Former Limuru MP Peter Mwathi said he is happy with the decision.
