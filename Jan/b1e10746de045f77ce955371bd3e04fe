Primaries have been a thorn in the flesh for many political outfits around the world, and we can attest to this in Kenya.Yesterday, however, marked a fresh start for Kenyan politics as the Jubilee Party made history. This is the first time an African party has used a smart card to register members.It's not only a smart move by the Jubilee Party &mdash; it's a brilliant move and it could be a game-changer in the August general election.In 2012, before birth of the Jubilee coalition, TNA had already shown in its activities that politics can be done differently and better. Launching the membership smart card is another example of how JP has sought to revolutionise the way politics is played.The card is intended to ensure that there will be no fraud and that the people really do choose their candidates in nominations. Jubilee knows technology can help achieve free and fair elections, but it also knows that technology can fail!The mega party is, however, willing to take that risk and ensure all party supporters are given the power to directly choose their candidates. A system like the one Jubilee launched gives confidence to both aspirants and their supporters that they will be treated in a free and fair manner.The smart card has a unique bar code that is machine verifiable and captures a member&rsquo;s name, national identity card number and telephone number. It will be impossible for someone to vote more than once as Jubilee goes Smart.It will no longer be possible for candidates to print their own cards and distribute them to supporters as they did in the past. Every vote will be a valid vote that is cast by an actual person &mdash; no ghosts voting or double voting.It will be impossible for opposition supporters in primaries to support a JP candidate they know is bound to lose in the general election &mdash; a favourite trick in the past in swing-vote regions like the Coast.This is because the system is able to detect whether the person activating a card is a registered member of another party.Jubilee Party will have a scientific data bank of registered members on which to base forecasts and plan campaign strategies. Even if rich candidates help their supporters in buying the cards, it will not make a difference &mdash; those will all be valid votes for the party.Membership recruitment comes at an opportune moment for Jubilee as monthly countrywide mass voter registration begins on Monday. As in 2013, JP will be able to recruit members while it urges people to register as voters.The writer is a political and communications consultant. Twitter @MachelWaikenda
