Wednesday evening was very emotional for the family of the four-year-old boy who had been kidnapped from his home in Thika town.Kelson Kimani was in a joyful reunion with his parents, siblings and other relatives after four painful days of anxiety.Kelson was rescued from his captors by police, who trailed the kidnappers to Kasarani as the gang attempted to transfer him to a different hideout in the Mwiki area. The five men and three women who had been holding the boy were arrested and arraigned in court yesterday.All is well that ends well, the saying goes, but credit must be given where credit is due.The police did a good job.The mandatory registration of all mobile phone sim cards played a major role in drastically reducing the number of kidnap incidents.From following every lead, identifying the suspects and their hideouts to trailing the kidnappers to the point of arrest and rescue, the Flying Squad did a commendable job.
