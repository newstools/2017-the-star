The Ministry of Transport has withdrawn commercial rights for Emirates Airlines to operate a third daily flight to Kenya, in what is seen as a plan to negotiate for a fair share of routes in favour of Kenya Airways. The government intends to review the existing Bilateral Air Service Agreement with the United Arabs Emirates "to ensure parity in the exercise of rights granted by the Air Service Agreement".Transport Principal Secretary Irungu Nyakera, in a letter dated January 20, 2017, told Emirates Airlines executive secretary in Nairobi Carolyne Kyule that the decision was reached after an informal discussion between the aeronautical authorities of Kenya and the UAE."In this regard, the republic of Kenya is unable to grant a third daily passenger frequency to Emirates Airline before the review," Nyakera says in the letter. The third daily flight from Dubai to Nairobi was set to begin on June 1, 2017, which could have increased the number of its flights between the two cities to 21 a week."Our earlier approval for flight EK 717/718 is subsequently withdrawn," the letter copied to the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority and the Kenya Airports Authority management reads in part.&ldquo;I believe the bilateral air service agreement is aimed at ensuring we have a more equitable share of routes. Anyway ours is just to implement what the government has said,&rdquo; Kenya Civil Aviation Authority Director General Gilbert Kibe told the Star.Emirates currently flies its Boeing 777-300ER twice daily between Nairobi and Dubai: EK 719 leaves Dubai at 10.25 am and arrives in Nairobi at 2.25 pm while EK 721 leaves Dubai at 4pm and arrives in Nairobi at 8.10pm.
