Betting control board director Simon Kiprono Chelugui has ditched Baringo governor race to vie for senator against Gideon Moi. The Star has established that Chelugui will fight for the seat through the Jubilee ticket in the August 8 vote, and has dropped his initial bid against Benjamin Cheboi.However, Chelugui denied the claims saying he is still consulting his team on their next move following the proposal that he guns for the senate seat."I have not changed my mind on contesting for the governor position. The option of going for the senate seat was just a proposal which we are still considering," Chelugui said."I am yet to announce it officially but for now I will have to soul-search and reason together with my people in the ground to know the way forward," he said.In case he opts for the senate seat, the governor race will be reduced to a contest between Cheboi, Stanley Kiptis (Baringo Knut secretary general) and Isaac Chebon (former Kenya School of Government Kabarnet campus director).Read: Three to face off with Cheboi for governorAlso read: Quit 2017 race for my support in 2022, Governor Cheboi asks rivalsMore on this: Ditch JP and join Kanu or forget about reelection, Lonyangapuo tells Cheboi Politicians from the county told the Star that the Chelugui candidature was settled on during a meeting at Deputy President William Ruto's Sugoi home on December 27, 2016."They ideologically saw Chelugui as equal to the task and can smash down the political heavy-weight Senator Moi," Joseph Makilap, MCA Barwessa ward, told the Star on Wednesday.Makilap hinted that the move could be a plot by jubilee leaders to destabilise Chulugui ahead of party nominations to be held in April.He said that decision will likely be 'a political burial of the BCLB boss', who was otherwise the people's most preferred candidate to unseat Governor Cheboi.Reportedly, DP Ruto coerced Chelugui to leave Cheboi's seat and go for Senate promising to fully support him in his new political bid, claims that the former BLCB boss refuted.Most locals are of the view that the senator race might prove challenging to Chelugui. The majority are of the view that it will not be easy to unseat Moi owing to his family's political influence in the region."Most of the residents still listen to former President Daniel Arap Moi. Chelugui, if he takes the offer, has a lot to do," a resident told the Star.And Chelugui's supporters are not pleased with the idea and have said that they were not consulted."To us, it seem as if he was just playing cards with our minds for his own personal gain," Kibiwot Tomno, a Chelugut's supporter from Emining, Mogotio sub-county, said."How can he sell our political right cheaply like that without consulting us?" he asked, terming the Sugoi decision as a show of lack of democracy in Jubilee Party.Despite the critic, some of the Jubilee supporters welcomed the move saying Chelugui will help tame Moi and KANU in Baringo during the August 8 general election."This is a step in the right direction. I am now confident that KANU dominance in Baringo will come to an end this year," Chebon Chebet, a Jubilee Party supporter in Baringo, said.
