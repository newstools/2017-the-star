Claims against IEBC nominees Wafula Chebukati (chairman) and Consolata Nkatha (commissioner) were not raised during their vetting, the selection panel has said.Integrity questions were raised against the two after President Uhuru Kenyatta nominated them last month.Chebukati was lawyer to former anti-graft chief Philip Kinisu, who was hounded out of office for allegedly pocketing Sh35 million from the National Youth Service.There are concerns that he could also have been a beneficiary of the cash but there is no evidence yet.Nkatha allegedly has an active criminal court case in which she is accused of defrauding Museums of Kenya of Sh280 million. She scored 55 per cent and was ranked last by the recruitment panel.Selection panel chairperson Bernadette Musundi said in a statement on Tuesday that had the allegations been brought to their attention in good time, the two applicants would have been informed."If this information was with the panel, it would have been considered and would have had an impact on the decision," she said.Read: IEBC selection panel meets as integrity queries hit nomineesMusundi urged Kenyans to submit any information they have on the suitability of the nominees as the selection process is ongoing.The information is to be presented to the National Assembly Departmental Committee on Justice and Legal affairsThe panel reconvened today to discuss damning and embarrassing allegations against the nominees.The panel, mostly made up of top religious leaders, has been bogged down by integrity claims against some of the nominees to the electoral commission.On December 23, the selection panel settled on Chebukati, alongside High Court advocate Tukero ole Kina for IEBC chairman. Kina scored 77 per cent against Chebukati&rsquo;s 63 per cent.But Uhuru &ndash; allowed by law to pick the electoral commission chairman from a list of two &ndash; pulled a surprise on Kenyans by settling on the less qualified Chebukati, who incidentally comes from the same region as IEBC chief executive Ezra Chiloba.Read: Selection panel shortlists five candidates for IEBC chairQuestions have also been raised on why the President ignored merit in appointing commissioners.For instance, Zephania Okeyo, who topped the nominees by scoring 80 per cent was not given the job.Also left out were Samuel Kimeu who got 68 per cent and Abdi Yakub Guliye ( 75 per cent).Uhuru nominated Abdi Guliye, Boya Molu, Nkatha, Margaret Mwachanya, Paul Kurgat and Roselyn Akombe as commissioners.Before going on recess, the MPs passed a motion allowing National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi to directly send the names to the Justice and Legal Affairs Committee for vetting.Read: Uhuru nominates Wafula Chebukati as IEBC chairAlso read :Law doesn&rsquo;t deny Chebukati and Chiloba IEBC jobs &ndash; Duale
