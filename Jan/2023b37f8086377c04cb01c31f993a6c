DPP Keriako Tobiko is stopping the National Police Service Commission from taking action on eight senior police officers interdicted over the April 2, 2015, Garissa University massacre. Three times, Tobiko has not responded to requests by DCI chief Ndegwa Muhoro to forward the investigation file back to the police who will take action on senior commanders. He is also yet to give advice whether to charge the top cops in court as recommended by DCI investigators. Investigations by the Internal Affairs Unit of the police recommended internal disciplinary action and not prosecution. The top security chiefs, who included Northeastern regional coordinator Ernest Munyi, CID boss Musa Yego, AP commander Christopher Muthee and county police boss Charles Wambugu were interdicted, following public outcry after the murder of 147 students by al Shabaab suspects. Other top chiefs include Garissa county commissioner Njenga Miiri, anti-terror boss Nicholas Kimanzi, Garissa police division Benjamin Ong&rsquo;ombe, station commander Charles Ayaro and subcounty AP boss John Cheruiyot Sawe. Al Shabaab suspects attacked the university and killed 148 people, mostly students, and injured more than 70. Tobiko is yet to respond to the November 2016 request by the DCI to return the investigations file to the directorate for action.
