Jubilee has accused Cord leader Raila Odinga of resorting to "two of his favourites - violence and lies&rdquo; after sensing defeat in the August 8 polls.Led by National Assembly Majority leader Aden Duale, several Jubilee MPs told Opposition leaders that &lsquo;Kenyans will not allow them to cause violence.In their address to the press at Parliament Buildings, the MPs hit out at Raila, accusing him of clutching on to his last straw ahead of the polls.They said his agenda is to muddy and discredit the elections in an attempt to negotiate a coalition government.&ldquo;It will not happen under this leadership,&rdquo; declared Duale. &ldquo;Majority of Kenyans will not tolerate and entertain this. They cannot allow a power-hungry lot to destroy our motherland."He further said Raila "keeps talking about Kenyans as if he is their spokesman. We are also Kenyans, and in the majority, and he doesn&rsquo;t speak for us."The address came shortly after the Opposition leader attacked the government over increased corruption, saying President Uhuru Kenyatta is a "patron of the corrupt".Kenya was ranked one of the most corrupt countries in Africa and on the globe. Transparency International's corruption index placed the country 145th out of 176 countries, with a score of 26.Read: Kenya 4th most corrupt country in East Africa - TI indexAlso see: [VIDEO] Corruption only thriving industry in Kenya, Uhuru its patron - RailaThe Cord leader also said the government was planning to borrow another Sh83 billion to pay off debts.Raila told journalists at his home in Karen, Nairobi, on Friday that the day of reckoning had caught up with the nation.He spoke hours after Treasury CS Henry Rotich said the country was borrowing to encourage investments and meet expenditure.

How much can one lie to get the presidency?&rdquo; asked Duale, who is Garissa Town MP.Raila claimed on Tuesday that the NIS was interfering with voter registration by listing people in Uganda and Ethiopia. Raila said the malpractice involves taking BVR kits to Uganda and Ethiopia and assisting their citizens to register for the poll."NIS is also assisting the citizens of these countries to acquire Kenyan identification documents, cross into Kenya and register as voters," he said.More on this: [VIDEO] Raila links NIS to election fraud, voter listing in Uganda and EthiopiaAlso read: Interior ministry, IEBC blast Raila over claim NIS meddling with voter registrationDuale said Raila has panicked and &ldquo;is looking for excuses anywhere and everywhere&rdquo; because he has come to the harsh reality that the number of Jubilee supporters is soaring.&ldquo;Jubilee supporters are registering day and night,&rdquo; he said.Calling the opposition chief a "perennial loser too well familiar with the feeling", Duale said the low turnout of voters in Cord strongholds "has caused him to lose his mind".The majority leader said the Cord leader&rsquo;s corruption narrative, which he said he is trying to hang on, is a figment of his own imagination."They are cheerleaders in writing fictitious reports about Kenya to get donor funding. The more they portray Kenya negatively, the mpre their purses swell," he said.
