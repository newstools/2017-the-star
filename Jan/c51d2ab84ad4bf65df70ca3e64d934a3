Meru Governor Peter Munya criticised Senator Kiraitu Murungi, woman representative Florence Kajuju and MP Mithika Linturi for undermining PNU campaigns for President Uhuru Kenyatta.He said the three leaders, nicknamed KIKALI, are campaigning for DP William Ruto&rsquo;s 2022 bid, instead of focussing on Uhuru&rsquo;s reelection. Munya spoke in Mukululu, Igembe Central, where he laid a foundation stone for construction of a classroom.Kiraitu is in the race for governor against the incumbent. Munya accused the three leaders of arm-twisting the President to believe he hates the Jubilee administration.He said he has been committed to ensuring more resources are distributed to the grassroots to support more development projects.&ldquo;I wonder if Kiraitu is the one who has the metre for gauging the amount of love I have for the national government. In JP, there are two teams &mdash; one that has the interests of Uhuru at heart and another allied to Ruto. KIKALI is allied to the DP. They are campaigning for his 2022 bid. That&rsquo;s why they challenge all I&rsquo;m doing,&rdquo; Munya said.&ldquo;Insecurity is high in Meru. Livestock theft has increased such that we don&rsquo;t have enough cows to pay bride price. We are being impoverished because we lack basic services. When I ask such questions, I&rsquo;m told I don&rsquo;t love the national government. I wonder if it is a bride so I marry it and take it home.&rdquo;He said he has used county funds prudently and urged the government to send more money to the counties so they can pursue more development initiatives.&ldquo;The President will be coming in February. We ask that he tell us about the mega dams we agreed should be constructed in Meru. We&rsquo;re waiting for development. We should not be compared to other counties, which have a lower population.&rdquo;
