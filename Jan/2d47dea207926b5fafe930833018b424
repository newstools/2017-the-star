The High Court in Meru has directed that a case filed by residents seeking that more magistrates be posted at the Maua law courts be heard urgently.It said lack of enough judicial officers is delaying justice. The case before Justice A Mabeya was filed by Meru lawyers and Maua residents, who are represented by advocate Michael Ngunjiri.It was adjourned until January 30 after the court admitted that the respondents &ndash; the Judicial Service Commission, Attorney General and judiciary registrar &ndash; were not given enough time to respond.Ngunjiri said there is a backlog of cases at the Maua station, which also serves as a mobile court in Garbatulla.&ldquo;As we speak, there is a standstill at the station because there are matters that cannot proceed. It is time we get a magistrate to speed up hearing of the cases. If they are given more time, people will continue suffering,&rdquo; he said.Ngunjiri said there are only three magistrates at the station after three others were transferred, leaving a senior resident magistrate who cannot determine cases involving more than Sh7 million.&ldquo;There are matters that should have been heard by the magistrates, but they have come to a halt. The court also serves the Garbatulla mobile court and operations are likely to be further grounded. We need the respondent advised to send a magistrate immediately,&rdquo; he said.A lawyer representing the AG&rsquo;s office and the judiciary sought adjournment, saying they were given very short notice to file a response.The registrar said the issue will be given a national outlook, instead of limiting it to Maua courts only. Mabeya said the matter should be dealt with urgently because it is of public interest. She said Maua people have a right to be served by the judiciary.
