China&rsquo;s rising investment in Kenya&rsquo;s infrastructure development has brought about minimal technology transfer, the Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry has said.Mega deals in infrastructure development has seen China become the country&rsquo;s largest bilateral lender, having overtaken Japan in early 2014. Official data from the National Treasury, published in the Central Bank&rsquo;s Quarterly Economic Review, shows Kenya owed China about $3.1 billion (about Sh321.91 billion) as at last June.However, KNCCI says despite the huge investments, China brings in low-quality machines, spare parts and telecommunications gadgets. &ldquo;We have tested Chinese technology and many people are crying,&rdquo; the business lobby&rsquo;s national vice chairman Laban Onditi said. &ldquo;Its technology is not serving to the required standards.&rdquo;He said lack of a policy to protect Kenyans has led to an influx of &ldquo;cheap&rdquo; Chinese-manufactured goods in the country.The World Bank last year warned that cheap Chinese imports may hurt Kenya&rsquo;s bid to industrialise under the ambitious Vision 2030 development blueprint, with a possible closure of some industries.The policy research working paper &ndash; Deal or no Deal: Strictly Business for China in Kenya? &ndash; indicated the growth of Kenya&rsquo;s manufacturing sector is falling every year.The sector recorded a slower growth in 2016 as industries struggled to cope in a tough business environment, characterised by massive layoffs and closure of some businesses, the Kenya Association of Manufacturers said last month.KAM chief executive Phyllis Wakiaga has said the sector was under constant threat of cheap, illicit imports. The manufacturers&rsquo; lobby estimates that local firms are losing at least 40 per cent of their market share to counterfeit and illicit trade which has &ldquo;unfairly&rdquo; eaten into the industry&rsquo;s earnings.Major local industries have closed business in the last five years. They include battery maker Eveready, which shut down its Nakuru plant over cheap imported batteries.Last year, tyre manufacturer Sameer Africa announced it would close its Mombasa Road manufacturing plant in favour of imports from China and India. The company&rsquo;s managing director Allan Walmsley blamed the closure on competition from cheap and subsidised tyre imports mainly from China that enter the Kenyan market.&ldquo;Our exports have stagnated at 15 per cent of gross domestic product, while imports have grown to 40 per cent of GDP, creating a trade imbalance, weakening the Kenyan shilling and increasing inflationary pressure,&rdquo; Wakiaga said.
