General Motors East Africa maintained its grip on new motor vehicle market last year even as industry sales fell on higher excise duty in the first half, data showed on Tuesday. Dealers sold 6,097 units less in 12 months through December 2016 than 19,966 units in 2015, Kenya Motor Industry Association said.This was a result of Sh150,000 duty on vehicles aged less than three years and Sh200,000 on manufactured earlier, a policy that hurt low-priced cars.The new duty effected in December 2015 under the Excise Act was last June scrapped in favour of 20 per cent duty of vehicles value. GM East Africa sold 4,751 units in 2016 giving it a market share of 35.1 per cent, followed by Toyota with 19.4 per cent (2,632 units), while Simba Colt (largely Mitsubishi and Fuso) held 16 per cent share (2,164 units).
