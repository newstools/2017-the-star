President-elect Donald Trump has named his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, as one of his senior White House advisers.The 35-year-old played a key role in the presidential campaign and his new White House job will cover both domestic and foreign policy.Kushner, who is married to Ivanka Trump, is a property developer with a wide range of business interests.His appointment will be controversial because of nepotism laws and concerns over potential conflicts."Jared has been a tremendous asset and trusted adviser throughout the campaign and transition and I am proud to have him in a key leadership role in my administration," said Trump.The New York businessman will be inaugurated as the 45th president on 20 January.Members of Trump's team have argued that a law barring officials from giving government jobs to relatives does not apply to White House positions.There are also federal ethics laws that mean government employees cannot profit from any businesses.
