The Nairobi Water Company on Sunday released a schedule on the rationing of water supply in major estates in the county.This comes a week after they announced a shortage in the capacity of water in the Ndakaini dam, the main reservoir that serves the city.The 33 cubic metre dam, which supplies 85 per cent of the city's water, is currently 40 per cent full, a situation the company has termed alarming.More on this: Water rations for Nairobi from January-April as Ndakaini levels dropNCWSCmanaging director Philip Gichuki, said the water rationing exercise is expected to be continue until the onset of the long rains in March. &ldquo;We have been forced to reduce the number of distribution. If an estate was receiving water for four days we will be forced to reduce it to three days and those receiving for five days will now get water for four days,&rdquo; Gichuki said.He said that the dam has only received 250mm of rain against the 1,000mm usually experienced by this time.He urged the residents to use the little water they have been receiving sparingly as their was risk of further rationing if the rains delayed.&ldquo;We want to urge the residents of Nairobi to use the little water they will be receiving well so that we can get to the long rains and ensure that might see an increase in the levels at the Dam,&rdquo; Gichuki said.Read: Pray for rains or taps will run dry, water firm urges residentsMore on this: Expect serious drought early in 2017, UN warns KenyaAreas that will experience severe water shortage include Lang'ata and Karen estate in the Southern parts.In the Nairobi Northern region, including City park, Gumba, Huruma, Pangani, Mlango Kubwa, Gigiri and Runda are also expected to be severely affected.Other regions that will be affected are Nairobi central, Nairobi East and Nairobi West regions.County Water executive Peter Kimori said prolonged drought in upper parts of Nairobi, including Aberdares, KIkuyu and Mt Kenya regions, have drastically led to the reduction in water at the Ndakaini dam."We are urging Nairobians to understand us. These are natural causes that we do not have control over. We urge them to only use water on necessary matters like drinking and cooking," he said. "Others like washing cars and water flower gardens should be shelved or they use recycled water," he added.But he said the county will give priority to key facilities such as hospitals, which cannot operate without water."If it does not rain in the near future, then I can tell you for sure we are in trouble. Some people have started sending me obscene messages but they need to understand," he said.
