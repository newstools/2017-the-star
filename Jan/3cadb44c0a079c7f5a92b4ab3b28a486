Interior Cabinet Secretary Joseph Nkaissery has directed all 47 county commissioners to profile administrative chiefs for loyalty ahead of the general election (see report P9).Making the directive, Nkaissery controversially declared opposition supporters have no business being in the government of the day.He met the Kajiado county commissioner and deputy county commissioners in an encounter described as tense by reporters. Nkaissery said this was the first of a series of meetings he will hold with administrators in other counties.Requiring that chiefs be loyal to the national government ought to be different from finding out whether they are loyal to Cord or Jubilee. Chiefs should be neutral and concentrate on administrative duties.What is Nkaissery&rsquo;s loyalty testing? Is it like polygraph testing, also known as lie or deception detection, complete with its own technology and used in US law enforcement? Even that is an inexact science.A descent into bureaucratic witch-hunting is the last thing Kenya needs in an election year.
