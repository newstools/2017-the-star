Delays in commissioning the mineral rights board has stalled issuance of mining and prospecting licenses to investors, sector players have said.Hundreds of applications have piled up at the ministry since a new law requiring the constitution of the board to review and approve licenses came into force in May 2016.Among those affected is Australian mining company Base Titanium which in June 2015, applied for prospecting license to the south west of its current operations.While this license application was approved by the mining license committee under the previous Mining Act, it must be endorsed by the Mineral Rights Board before being issued under the Mining Act 2016.&ldquo;We are just waiting. We have not received any communication from the ministry so far but we hope to commence once we secure the license,&rdquo; External affairs and development manager Simon Wall told the Star.Pending applications include firms interested in exploring and mining gold, rare earth and coal, among other key minerals in the country.The government set up a mineral rights board in August 2016, which replaced the licensing advisory committee.The board is mandated to oversee licensing and leasing, and is expected to reduce the time taken to process an application via the newly launched mining register portal.Mining Cabinet secretary Dan Kazungu however said application will start being considers this year.&ldquo;No one can get a license until the mineral rights board is fully operational, so there is nothing,Let people be patient,&rdquo; Kazungu said &ldquo;They have to wait,&rdquo;Section 31 of the Mining Act 2016 stipulates the board will advise and give recommendations to the CS on the grant, rejection, retention, renewal, suspension, revocation, variation, assignment, trading, tendering, or transfer of mineral rights agreements.
