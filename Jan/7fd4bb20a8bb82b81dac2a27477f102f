The East Africa Legislative Assembly has a passed a Bill outlawing female genital mutilation in the region.The EAC Prohibition of FGM Bill, 2016, proposed by Dora Byamukama, was passed by the assembly sitting in Kampala, Uganda.It is seen as critical to outlawing the cultural practice.The Bill states that the culture of FGM brings with it complications, including child marriage, defilement and in health problems, that sometimes lead to transmission of HIV and can cause death and injuries. In a report, the Committee on Legal, Rules and Privileges said FGM is prevalent in some communities such as in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda and immigrants of Somalia and Ethiopia.It is a cross-border practice that requires the cooperation and collaboration of EAC partner states to implement the law and eliminate the cut, it says.
