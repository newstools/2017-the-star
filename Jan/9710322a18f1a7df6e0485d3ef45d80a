Athletics Kenya (AK) Eastern branch have written to the Athletics Kenya president Jack Tuwei seeking clarification over the continued suspension of chairman Joseph Kinyua by the IAAF over misappropriation of funds from sponsors Nike.Kinyua was cleared by the IAAF on the second count of involvement in anti-doping violations but still has a pending case citing allegations of of diversion of funds from Nike.Acting chairman Kithinji Maragara wrote: &ldquo;Has the IAAF Ethics Board sought the federation&rsquo;s (AK) position on the matter and keeping the federation abreast of the proceedings, consideration the funds purported to have been diverted belongs to the federation?Maragara, who was acting on behalf of the branch following an executive committee meeting held on December 19, 2016, also sought clarification whether the federation agrees or disagrees with the IAAF that funds paid to it by Nike were diverted.&ldquo;What is the federation&rsquo;s position on the allegations given that as at May 16, 2014, when our chairman Joseph Kinyua (then AK treasurer) handed over (office) to the current treasurer, he had no pending issues and none have been raised since by the federation,&rdquo; asked Maragara through a letter dated January 5, 2017.He observed that Kinyua was investigated by the Department of Criminal Investigations over the matter in February 2015 but there have been no charges levelled against him so far.&ldquo;As a region, we are greatly disadvantaged by his absence because there is a vacuum in proven leadership skills, management experience, financial mobilisation and insitutional capacity,&rdquo; added Maragara. &ldquo;We feel that the effect of his continued suspension may lead to a serious lag in development of athletics in the region, to its detriment.&rdquo;
