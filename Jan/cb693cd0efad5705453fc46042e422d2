The Kenya National Union of Teachers has said it will only support political candidates who have teachers&rsquo; interests at heart.Secretary general Wilson Sossion said the union will no longer support aspirants based on their parties.Teachers will rally behind those who choose to associate themselves with the teaching fraternity and guarantee to agitate for their rights if elected, he said.Sossion added, &ldquo;We want to elect people who consider our interests and not the greedy ones who go there and fight for themselves, forgetting the people who voted for them.&rdquo;He spoke at Kembu in Bomet East on Sunday. The unionist said all aspirants on various political outfits have equal chances in their races, but urged the electorate to choose wisely so they do not elect self-seeking individuals.Sossion was with Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto, Senator Wilfred Lesan, National Assembly deputy speaker Joyce Laboso, MP Bernard Bett, AGC Kenya Bishop Robert Langat and other aspirants. Sossion urged politicians to conduct peaceful campaigns in the run up to the polls.
