The success of ODM primaries in its strongholds will determine voter turnout for the August 8 election, political analyst Jared Okello has said.He said shambolic nominations have in the past led to voter apathy, which cost ODM critical seats. Okello said party leader Raila Odinga will not make the mistake he made in 2013, when the party lost to rivals due to poor nominations. Okello, who is vying for Nyando MP, said the party has learnt its lesson and no candidate will be imposed on the people.&ldquo;To avoid backlash and voter apathy in his backyard, Raila will at all cost avoid endorsing any candidate for a seat. He will let the people elect the leaders of their choice,&rdquo; he said. Some aspirants are skeptical that the nominations will be free, transparent and fair to reflect the will of the people.
