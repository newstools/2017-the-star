Politicians who use witchcraft to get elected will die, Bishop Wilber Gogo of Gospel Revival Churches has said.He said ritual wounds inflicted by witch doctors will not heal and their &lsquo;medicine&rsquo; will become deadly poison.&ldquo;We are starting our prayers and fasting on Monday. Any MCA, senator, governor MP, woman representative or President seeking witchcraft to get to leadership will fail terribly,&rdquo; Gogo said.He addressed his congregation on Sunday in Kwale. Gogo urged the church to fill the gap and pray for the country. &ldquo;There are leaders who go to witch doctors to get incisions. Let them be careful this round because if they try, they will have wounds that will not heal and those taking drugs from witch doctors will die there,&rdquo; he warned.
