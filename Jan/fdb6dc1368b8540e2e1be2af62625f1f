Pokot herders have invaded the Rimoi Game Reserve in Elgeyo Marakwet in search of pasture and water.Emsoo MCA Christopher Cheboiboch said hundreds of herders are now moving their livestock into the national game reserve, which could strain limited resources and increase conflicts over resources in the Kerio Valley.&ldquo;Right now, Pokot herders are forcibly moving their remaining cows to Marakwet. This is a recipe for conflict because Marakwets are against the move,&rdquo; he said.Cheboiboch said hundreds of cattle are dying in Kerio Valley as shrubs that farmers relied on to feed animals have dried up as the drought continues to wreak havoc.The MCA said the area has been left out of the relief food distribution and appealed for urgent supply.He accused the state of failing to buy livestock as it promised at the beginning of January.Kiptanui Sawe, a livestock farmer in Soi, Keiyo South, said he has lost 20 cows in a week.He urged the state to buy the remaining cows as there is no pasture or water. He said traders are exploiting them by offering Sh2,000 for each cow.
