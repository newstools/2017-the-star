Cord leader Raila Odinga has said that the second round of mass voter registration exercise which kicks off on Monday will mark the beginning of the journey to liberate the country from bad leadership.Raila urged residents in the larger Nyanza region to turn out in large numbers and register as voters, lamenting that they can only be his &lsquo;soldiers&rsquo; during the 2017 general elections if they register en-mass."The battle is on for the citizens to choose between the status quo and the change that they believe in," Raila said.The opposition chief regretted that the struggle for independence divided the country along tribal lines, adding that the push is still on even though the democratic struggle has claimed many lives.Raila spoke on Saturday at Kapiyo in Bondo during the funeral service of activist and scholar Professor Rok Ajulu who died in South Africa.He eulogized the late Professor as a pan-Africanist and a great member of the African race in the struggle for democracy who insisted on the need to continue with the struggle.Professor Ajulu, 66, was the husband to South Africa&rsquo;s Human Settlement Minister Lindiwe Sisulu.
