You all know the song Muziki by Tanzanian singer Darassa which currently has over 3 million views on Youtube. Well, yesterday Darassa revealed that he went to a witch for black magic powers.In an interview with a top Tanzanian based radio station, Darassa revealed that his personal problems led him to go for black powers. This caught fans by surprise who claimed his song Muziki that has become a monster hit in East Africa is largely influenced by witchcraft.However, Darassa has denied claims that he uses witchcraft to make good his music but rather because he had pressing personal problems and not music. Darassa who was involved in a road accident few days after his hit song was released said that for a long time now, he has not gone to seek for more black powers.This is what Darassa said about going to a witch doctor;Kwenye maisha yangu nishawahi kwenda kwa mganga kitambo sana...Sisi tunatoka uswahilini vitu vingi vinatokea...tena haikuhusiana na music ni personal life yangu...Taratibu zake hazikunifanya mimi kuendelea tena...Sikufikia hizo stage zote, maelezo yalinishinda kwa sababu kwenye ukuaji mtaani hivo ni vitu ambavyo viko sana siwezikusema sivijui...Just late last year another Tanzanian top artist Diamond Platnumz was accused of using witchcraft to popularise his music. Ommy Dimpoz who was once upon a time, good friends with Diamond, revealed the allegations saying that he (Diamond) wanted to introduce Ommy to his witch doctor. But he refused.
