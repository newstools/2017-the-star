Two leaders in Kitui county have urged the government to reintroduce the school feeding programme to keep children in school.The prolonged drought has caused some children to drop out of school in search of food and water in various counties hard-hit by the dry spell.Kitui Senator David Musila and Mwingi North MP John Munuve said the area did not receive enough rain, resulting in a poor harvest.Starvation is looming and students will remain in school if there is food, Musila said. &ldquo;The government should provide food to residents too since they have nothing in their stores. We are not sure if the next rain season will be sufficient, so the state should plan fully,&rdquo; he said.On security issues, Munuve urged the government to arm residents as armed Somali herders have killed more than 20 people now. The insecurity and drought is &ldquo;finishing Kambas&rdquo;, he said.
