All ODM members who do not take part in voter registration campaigns can forget about the ODM ticket. &ldquo;ODM made a resolution that the 30 days scheduled by the IEBC for voter registration are spent on mobilising supporters to register as voters. Anybody ignoring this must face reprimand,&rdquo; national chairman John Mbadi said. Speaking to the Star on Tuesday, the Suba MP criticised members he did not identify for only concentrating on their own agenda instead of helping the party meet the IEBC target. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s wrong for an aspirant or a member to prioritise their personal interest rather than that of the party. We know some aspirants who have become a big problem to the party, hence, they shouldn&rsquo;t prepare for the ODM ticket,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The certificate will be given to those who identify themselves with the party.&rdquo;
