The Jubilee government has initiated numerous development projects at the Coast, contrary to reports from Opposition, Mvita MP aspirant Omar Shallo has said.Shallo said there is a wrong perception about the Jubilee Party and President Uhuru Kenyatta at the Coast, which need to be changed."It is wrong to have this impression that President Uhuru has been riding on county and donor-funded projects, there are so many development projects that have been initiated at the Coast by the President. We should stop propaganda that misleads Kenyans," he said.Shallo seeks to remove ODM's Abdulswamad Nassir from the Mvita constituency seat.Last week, Mombasa governor Hassan Joho accused the Jubilee Administration of taking credit for projects funded by World Bank and other international donors.Uhuru was in Mombasa, where he commissioned the Buxton Foot Bridge, Bamburi storm water drainage system, and the Ziwa la Ng&rsquo;ombe slum upgrading projects which were funded by the World Bank.Joho, who is the ODM deputy party leader, challenged Uhuru to initiate new projects and stop clinging onto those initiated more than five years ago.Read: [VIDEO] Joho lectures Uhuru on hijacking Mombasa projectsShallo highlighted the road projects in Mombasa, Kilifi, Kwale and Lamu which are coming up and the markets which were recently renovated.He said he will be vying on a Jubilee ticket in a region which is considered as an opposition stronghold, but Kenyans should focus on an individuals rather than the party of choice."I&rsquo;m in Jubilee, but I urge Mvita residents to look at me as an individual. My party should not be a decisive factor. Look at what I have to offer, that the incumbent has failed to give you," he said.He was speaking to the Star after attending a Zefe (Muslim) ceremony that was held in the streets of Mvita on Saturday afternoon.Shallo, who is one of the youthful aspirants in Mombasa, urged the youth to come out and register in large numbers during the voters&rsquo; mass registration that will kick off this week."Your vote will enable you to vote for the right person," he said.Read: IEBC to conduct mass voter registration in January, 2017
