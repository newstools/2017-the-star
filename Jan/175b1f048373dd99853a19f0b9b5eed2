FISHING LODGE, NYERIFor a mountain retreat, Aberdares National Park is one of my favourite places to visit. We had booked a weekend trip to the self-catering Fishing Lodge located in the central Aberdares National Park. Fishing Lodge is managed by the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS). As the name suggest, the Aberdares are popular for trout fishing in the clear mountain rivers.As we drove up the mountain, the vegetation changed from low altitude forest to glades of redwood trees, towering Podocarpus with twisted trunks, and other forest trees festooned with a dangling feathery moss called &lsquo;old man&rsquo;s beard&rsquo;.Though we did not see any elephants, we could tell they were around because of dung balls on the road and smooth patches on tree trunks they like to rub themselves. The lodge is actually two rustic log cabins, with en-suite bedrooms, kitchen and large living room with fireplace. The cabins are well maintained and the kitchen has cooker, basic cooking utensils and cutlery. There is no fridge so one should plan the menu accordingly and pack frozen perishables in a good cooler box. The cabins are a good lodging option for those who want to escape into the wild but are not keen on outdoor camping. Phone network was off and there is no television but it was pleasure to get away from technology for a couple of days. CONTACTS: (+254 ) ( 20 ) 2379407/08/09Star rating: 4/5
