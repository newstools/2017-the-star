He urged supporters to adopt a six-piece voting system.Ruto reiteriated that the electorate will be the ones to decide which candidate gets the Jubilee Party ticket through a transparent process.&ldquo;The nomination process will be free, fair and democratic. We do not have preferred candidates,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;All Jubilee candidates will go through the nomination process. It is you as the electorate who will decide who gets the ticket.&rdquo;Ruto appealed to Jubilee candidates for elective seats to work with those who will win the nomination.&ldquo;Jubilee candidates, including those seeking to be governors, MPs and MCAs should support those who will win the primaries,&rdquo; he said.Ruto was accompanied by Nakuru Governor Kinuthia Mbugua, Deputy Governor Joseph Ruto, speaker Susan Kihika, MPs Moses Cheboi, Jacob Macharia, David Gikaria, Liza Chelule, Joseph Kiuna, Samuel Arama and a host of Jubilee aspirants.The DP said the country is better off under the leadership of the Jubilee administration, not the opposition.He said opposition leaders have nothing new to offer because they have been in power for &ldquo;a period of about 100 years as ministers and Prime Minister and they did nothing&rdquo;.&ldquo;Those in the opposition have served for years in government. What did they do that is visible?&rdquo;Ruto said the opposition has been making a fuss of the electoral agency because it has sensed defeat.&ldquo;They [opposition] have realised they will lose in August, that is the reason they are unreasonably criticising the electoral process,&rdquo; he said. Ruto urged government officials tasked with issuing IDs to observe the three-day processing period.
