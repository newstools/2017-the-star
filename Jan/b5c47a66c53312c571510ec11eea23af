You can jail our union officials if you are not willing to end the strike, doctors have told the government.The seven officials, who went down on their knees at the Railways Club yesterday, said they want nothing short of the implementation of the 2013 collective bargaining agreement. The Labour Court declared the CBA null and void last year."This is a fight for better healthcare for the citizens of this country. This is not for doctors," Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Union chairman Samuel Oroko said.Secretary general Ouma Oluga said it is shameful for the government to jail doctors fighting to improve the country's health system."If going to jail makes us weak, so be it. We shall proudly walk to jail with our heads high."The doctors went on strike on December 5 seeking to have the government implement the contentious CBA."The government should stop blaming doctors for not registering the CBA. It is not the work of the employee to do that, but the work of the employer," Oluga said.KMPDU took the CBA to court for registration last year, but Justice Monica Mbaru ruled that the union has to negotiate a new one with the Health ministry, Salaries and Remuneration Commission and the counties. The counties now employ nearly 90 per cent of doctors, but were not involved in the 2013 CBA.Some doctors said if their officials are jailed tomorrow morning, there will be no further negotiations.The officials facing jail are Oluga, Oroko, deputy secretary general Chibanzi Mwachonda, vice chairman Titus Ondoro, treasurer Daisy Korir, assistant treasurer Evelyn Chege and Allan Ochanji."I don't want anyone to go to jail, but if that is what it takes to make Kenyans know the reality in the public health sector, so be it," Cynthia Ogundo, a consultant at Mbagathi Hospital said."We will not go back to hospitals that are not well-equipped and work in poor conditions. There is no doctor who is wrongfully on strike," Obstetrics and gynaecologist Nelly Bosire said.The industrial action has forced Kenyans in need of medical services to dig deeper into their pockets to seek treatment in private hospitals.Doctors working in mission hospitals are overwhelmed by the high number of patients they are seeing.President Uhuru Kenyatta offered doctors a 40% salary increase but the doctors turned down the offer on grounds that it was not in line with the CBA.
