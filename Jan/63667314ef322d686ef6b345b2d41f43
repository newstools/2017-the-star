Former Nairobi Town Clerk Philip Kisia and former Gatanga MP Peter Kenneth have teamed up to unseat Governor Evans Kidero at the August 8 poll.Kisia will be Kenneth&rsquo;s running mate. Speaking to the Star yesterday, he said Kidero has been caught &ldquo;flat-footed in all aspects&rdquo; in the four years he has been in office.&ldquo;Kidero has failed in both software and hardware. Nairobi is worse than I left it and this is what PK and myself are seeking to correct,&rdquo; Kisia said.&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve the same belief, same aspiration and are ready to serve.&rdquo;He said garbage collection is at its worst, traffic congestion worsening and corruption the order of the day at City Hall.Kisia said the Kidero administration has failed to implement the integrated waste management plan he developed before he left office.&ldquo;Traffic management and public transport system are wanting. Implementing what had already been developed has become a problem to this administration,&rdquo; he said.Kisia said the county has failed to work with the national security agencies to improve community policing and reduce crime.&ldquo;If anything, I doubt if the administration has tarmacked 50 kilometres of road since it took over,&rdquo; he said.Kisia told the Star if elected, they will deliver on their promises because they have an impressive track record and will transform the city.&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll implement the Jubilee policy. The reason Kidero has failed is because his party ODM and Cord lack clear policies and agenda for Kenyans,&rdquo; the hopeful said.Kidero faces an uphill task in his reelection bid if the number of those seeking to unseat him is anything to go by. Senator Mike Sonko, Dagoretti South MP Dennis Waweru, former Starehe MP Margaret Wanjiru and MP Johnson Sakaja are all eyeing the city&rsquo;s top job on the JP ticket.
