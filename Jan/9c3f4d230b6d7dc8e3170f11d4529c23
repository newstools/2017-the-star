Fifteen former employees of the Libyan Embassy in Nairobi have sought the intervention of the Foreign Affairs ministry to help them get their terminal dues.The employees were sacked in 2012, following the collapse of the Muammar Gaddafi regime in the midst of the Arab Spring. They had worked for 10 to 13 years, but were kicked out when a new administration took over. Through their spokesman, India Doka, they said the Charge d&rsquo;Affaires has refused to pay them up, even though both sides had agreed on the details of the payment.&ldquo;We have been chasing our dues for the last three years to no avail,&rdquo; Doka told the Star in the company of her colleagues yesterday.They asked CS Amina Mohamed to intercede and ensure the embassy complies with the law. They said the issue surrounding their pay is riddled with intrigues and accused the ministry of not coming to their rescue.
