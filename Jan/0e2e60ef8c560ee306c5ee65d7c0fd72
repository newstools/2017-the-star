Rarieda MP Nicholas Gumbo has said the only way NASA would be guaranteed a direct win against the Jubilee government is sticking together.He said if they are divided, they risk losing separately.Gumbo cited the 1992 general election, when a strong opposition crafted by Jaramogi Odinga, Keneth Matiba and Mwai Kibaki separated and lost to retired President Daniel Moi.&ldquo;In 1992 Moi wax elected with less than 32 per cent of the votes after the unified opposition leaders parted ways,&rdquo; he said.Gumbo was speaking on Friday at the CDF office in Aram, where more than Sh24 million bursary cash was distributed to 500 applicants.He urged NASA leaders to tread carefully and sacrifice their personal ambitions for the sake of prosperity.&ldquo;We can only have one president at a time,&rdquo; Gumbo said.He urged the opposition leaders to make good decisions so the outfit does not disintegrate.
