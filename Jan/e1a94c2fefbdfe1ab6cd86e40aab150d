Samburu residents have maintained that they will not allow any further interference from marauding elephants after two people were gored by the jumbos.They said that the deaths, experienced this week, will not be tolerated and that they will kill the animals in the event that KWS fails to act on their alarm calls.Elijah Leririo, a resident, said that no police officer or KWS official has responded to their complaints of attacks by the wild animals that stray into their farms."The government should give us an alternative land, failure to which we are going to kill all the elephants. We are not cowards," Leririo said.The group, largely from Kirimon area, lamented that conservationists have given more value to the jumbos at the expense of the human lives that are under threat."Are elephants more important than people like the conservationists want us to believe?" Silas Lempirdan said.On Tuesday, the residents asked KWS to take action by controlling the elephants or else they kill any that will be found roaming in the area.Laikipia deputy warden Simon Gitahi said on Thursday that KWS rangers have been deployed in the area and will deal with any elephant that strays from nearby parks."We are going to leave our rangers here so that in case there is an incident, it would be easy for them to respond," he said."We don&rsquo;t want any Kenyan to lose his life because of wildlife. Human life is very important," Gitahi said. He discouraged residents against killing the elephants, adding that they only pushed out of their habitats following the drought experienced in Samburu and Laikipia counties.Gitahi noted that four people have been killed by elephants in the region and several others left with severe injuries.He urged people walking at night, early in the morning or late in the evening to be more vigilante especially with elephants.Read: Two Samburu families seek Sh800,000 from KWS for livestock losses
