Counties are free to advertise doctors' positions and conduct recruitment so the public can be treated, Council of Governors chairman Peter Munya has said.Munya, who is Meru county chief, also said on Monday that public service boards have been instructed to begin the processes of firing striking doctors.He said they also have permission to recover money that may have been paid to those who have not been working.The Governor told a meeting of his counterparts that medics will face the stated disciplinary action if they do not return to work by Wednesday.Munya said they should comply with court orders on the matter, failure of which counties will have no option but to dismiss them."The government's offer is reasonable. The national and county governments will not pay any worker who is absent without lawful reason," he said during a meeting with governors on Monday."The council is committed to resolve the stalemate and see the resumption of health services."On December 13, 2016, the Labour Relations court declared the doctors strike illegal and ordered them to resume work immediately.The court directed union officials to call off the strike that has contributed to the deaths of at least 20 people.The CoG chairman further denied claims that health services have come to a halt in some counties."While a number of doctors are on strike, a good number have decided to respect the law and are currently working," he said.The doctors, after a meeting with President Uhuru Kenyatta in Mombasa, rejected the government's offer to increase their salaries by 40 per cent.A day later, a team of union officials were ejected from the Treasury building after they insisted on the 300 per cent raise as stated in their 2013 CBA with government.Read: [VIDEO] Doctors union officials ejected from Treasury meeting after rejecting Uhuru's offerThe government has blamed the doctor's union for the 'illegal strike' that started on December 5, 2016.This was after it offered a Sh50,000 increase for the lowest paid doctors, which would raise their salaries to Sh176,000, but unions rejected the same.Spokesman Eric Kiraithe said the union was offered good packages but instead it has not stopped the strike.Read: Doctors begin 'longest strike in history' over 2013 CBA agreementMore on this: State blames KMPDU for 'unfortunate' doctors strike
