The NGO Coordination Board is a "regime puppet" being used to undermine civil society organisations, they said yesterday.The lobby groups were responding to board's allegations that the Kenya Human Rights Commission had evaded tax, illegally hired foreigners and is using unregistered accounts.Speaking in Nairobi, Suba Churchill, the presiding convener of the Civil Society Organisations Reference Group, said lobby groups will not be intimidated.He said they are ready to take legal action against the board over continuously frustrating them.&ldquo;I want to tell [NGO Coordination Board chairman] Fazul Mohamed that we will not be intimidated by the attacks he has launched on us. He has continuously fought in our public space with false allegations, but that will not stop us. Better still, we will consult a higher authority of the land, which is the Constitution,&rdquo; Churchill said.He termed the board an illegal bureau as it is not fully constituted. Former police boss Rtd Major General Hussein Ali did not take up his role of chairman after he was appointed.Henry Maina, the regional director Article 19 Eastern Africa, said the government is violating the Sustainable Development Goals that requires a country to have an all-inclusive society. The government has failed in this through its hard-line stance against civil societies, he said.The NGO board also violated guidelines on presenting its annual audit report for vetting, Maina said.&ldquo;The board has never presented a single annual audit report of the NGO Board that is presented to Parliament for vetting,&rdquo; he said.The lobbies said they will not be shaken by the board's threats as they greatly contribute to the economy.
