While it is okay for the national government to lease Land Cruisers for use by the National Police Service and cut down on acquisition and maintenance costs, the State should not lease armoured personnel carriers with mounted machine guns from the private sector (see page 11).In a democracy, military armoured cars are used for battlefield tasks, not civilian policing.The leasing of non-military vehicles is fine, but military vehicles and hardware should belong to the GoK garages and armouries, not in private sector showrooms for leasing to all comers.The concept of the State&rsquo;s monopoly of violence also entails a monopoly on violent, military calibre weapons.Rather than militarising the police, even in such banditry flashpoint regions as Marakwet, Laikipia and Kitui, the government should deploy the Army and Air Force.Private sector procurers and leasers of military grade hardware and vehicles are a brand new phenomenon in Kenya &mdash; and should be a field of inquiry by investigative reporters and scholarly researchers.
