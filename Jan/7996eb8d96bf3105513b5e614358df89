The Jubilee Party is optimistic of a win despite stiff opposition from the National Super Alliance. Tetu MP Ndung&rsquo;u Gethenji said JP is a party of development and not mere politics as NASA. &ldquo;Their regular joint meetings will not shake us. This is political competition. We have no fear of victory in August,&rdquo; he said. The MP said the Jubilee government has initiated many development projects, including the standard gauge railway, and he is hopeful Kenyans will reelect President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto. &ldquo;We shall ensure there is high voter turnout and fight voter apathy in Central. We should also all run on the JP ticket,&rdquo; Gethenji said. The legislator said he will seek reelection on the JP ticket. Gethenji spoke at the home of the late AIPCK head Archbishop John Mugecha on Thursday in Tetu constituency, when he went to condole with the family. Mugecha died early this week after a long illness. The MP said Mugecha was a national, spiritual and political leader who loved peace.
