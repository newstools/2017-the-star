The state has warned the Mombasa Republican Council against provoking national security agencies because they will be met with &ldquo;unspecified and severe&rdquo; consequences.Spokesperson Eric Kiraithe issued the threats weeks after three police officers were injured, following a raid by a gang armed with pangas and poisoned arrows at Kombani AP camp in Kwale county.He spoke on Friday during the state of the nation of address in Mombasa.Hinting that the attack came from MRC, Kiraithe said internal security surveillance is being reevaluated and strategies put in place to combat such attacks.Security agents are on high alert and the cult will not disrupt peace at the Coast as they did in the run-up to the March 4, 2013 general election.On the eve of voting, at least 18 people, including 10 security officers, were killed at the Coast. The attacks on polling stations were suspected to be the work of the then outlawed MRC.&ldquo;The truth of the matter is that you don't develop an area like Kwale with potential to thrive business-wise by creating insecurity,&rdquo; Kiraithe said.He warned that severe consequences are a direct manifestation of what happened in Mumias in late November after seven G3 riffles and 140 bullets were stolen from Booker police post.Police are reported to have attacked residents and set properties a blaze, as they searched for the weapons. They were recovered a few weeks later.Kiraithe said individuals and groups should use the legal system to air their grievances.&ldquo;Kenya is the most democratic nation in Africa. The Constitution has provided leeway for any issue to be resolved,&rdquo; he said.In early December, MRC spokesperson Richard Lewa said they plan to move to court to stop the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission's activities in the region before the next general election.He said they still maintain the &ldquo;Pwani si Kenya&rdquo; tag and IEBC services are not needed in the region.
