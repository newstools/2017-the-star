Those opposed to Musalia Mudavadi's appointment as Luhya spokesperson will become political outcasts, community leaders in Nairobi have said.City MCAs and other leaders from the Luhya community asked members to either support the ANC leader "or face the consequences".County liquor licensing chair Vincent Shimoli said it is "bad leaders" like Senators Moses Wetang'ula (Bungoma) and Bonny Khalwale (Kakamega) and a host of others who do not support Mudavadi."We urge Mudavadi to roll out a major outreach campaign to bring on board all political and opinion leaders of our community. We have faith in Mudavadi's diplomatic and networking skills accumulated over many years of working in government and in the private sector," Shimoli said on Saturday."In 2013 elections, we were labelled demons by some Jubilee leaders. It is the greatest disrespect to a Luhya to label him a demon. We have to all come together to support Mudavadi," said Haraambe MCA aspirant Johnson Mukwabwa.Makongeni MCA Peter Imwatok said Mudavadi is a leader of all the people of Western Kenya and not just the Luhya community."We the Tesos and others living in Western Kenya are supporting him. He is our leader," Imwatok added.Mudavadi was installed at the community's spokesperson on December 31, 2016 in a rally organised by Cotu boss Francis Atwoli.The event was skipped by Wetang'ula and Khalwale, much to the ire of Atwoli.Members in Mudavadi's ANC party have said he is the preferred presidential candidate for the opposition ahead of the August 8 polls.Read: Wetang'ula asked to drop presidential bid for more capable MudavadiAlso read: 'Angry' Atwoli hits at Khalwale, Wetang'ula, calls for respect during 'Luhya spokesman' rally
