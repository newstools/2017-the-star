Maragua residents have accused illicit brewers and drug peddlers of taking out the competition and police informants. Eight people have been killed in three years. Salome Mukami said her husband was killed last year after he was invited to eat gazelle meat by a local brewer called Githinji. Githinji was arrested and released and is now on the run. Esther Wanjiru said she was attacked by a gang last month on suspicion that she volunteers information to police about the illicit liquor trade. Her back was injured and she has been reduced to a beggar, she said.
