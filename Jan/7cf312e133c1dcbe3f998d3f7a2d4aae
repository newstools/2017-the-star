President Uhuru Kenyatta took a swipe at Thika Town MP Alice Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a and her Kabete counterpart Ferdinand Waititu for telling Kiambu residents not to vote until a road is constructed.Uhuru spoke on Friday when he toured parts of Kiambu county to mobilise his supporters to register as voters. He said the success of major government development projects will be determined at the ballot.&ldquo;I hear you won&rsquo;t register as voters until a road is constructed. Let&rsquo;s not dwell on such issues. We should register and be ready because we know what we are defending,&rdquo; the President said in Githurai, Ruiru subcounty.The President urged youth not to be used to cause disarray during the campaigns, saying the leaders are only interested in satisfying their own political agenda.Waititu and Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a were caught on camera telling Kiambu residents not to vote in the August polls if the Wangiuge-Ngecha-Rironi road won&rsquo;t be constructed.&ldquo;Everyone who has been elected must first refurbish this road if they want to be reelected. When Uhuru comes here he should also be told the same,&rdquo; Waititu said.In the same video clip Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a said, &ldquo;When the President comes, the first issue he should address before seeking votes or telling us to collect IDs and voter&rsquo;s cards is this road.&rdquo;Sources say a group of youth had gathered on Friday waiting for the President to heckle his rally until he heeds the politicians&rsquo; demands that the road be built.However, Uhuru only toured Ruiru, Gatundu, Juja and Thika subcounties. Close allies of the two legislators said the ground is hostile as their &lsquo;ill-timed&rsquo; remarks turned residents against them. &ldquo;Most residents have withdrawn their support for the two especially after Uhuru told residents to disregard the remarks,&rdquo; one source said.
