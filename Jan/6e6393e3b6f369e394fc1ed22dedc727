Kigumo youths plan to plant 3,000 trees around the Aberdare Range to save the water catchment area as water reserves dwindle for lack of rainfall.Kigumo Reloaded campaign leaders Julius Mwaura, Tony Kirere and William Mwangi on Monday said the initiative will run from the end of January, all through February ahead of the long rains in March.Trees will be planted around Ndakaini Dam and at the foot of the Aberdare Range. The dam provides 84 per cent of Nairobi&rsquo;s water supply. It has a storage capacity of 70 million cubic metres.Dry spell alertThe dam is reported to be less than 50 per cent full due to low rainfall last year, leading to water rationing in Nairobi and its environs.Early last month, the Meteorological Department and humanitarian agencies warned of a looming dry spell that may disrupt water supply in cities and rural towns.Mwaura said, &ldquo;Existing water sources cannot sustain demand. That&rsquo;s why we urge Kenyans to plant more trees to avert drought.&ldquo;Murang&rsquo;a is one of the catchment areas in the country and we are already facing drought. Drastic measures have to be taken.&rdquo;He urged the government to join the initiative.&ldquo;We are approaching all stakeholders from elected leaders, environmentalists, farmers and the Kenya Forest Service, because it is a collective undertaking we must all engage in,&rdquo; Mwaura said.The youths appealled to the organisers and participants of this year&rsquo;s Ndakaini Marathon to join the tree-planting initiative.Journalist and small-scale farmer William Mwangi said the diversion of water from rivers to farms and tree cutting for commercial purposes are to blame for the dam drying up.Mwangi urged tea factories to find alternative sources of energy.
