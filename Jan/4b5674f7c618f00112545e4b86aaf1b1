Confusion rocked the opposition's gathering at Bomas of Kenya in Nairobi on Wednesday when Cord supporters took over the auditorium.It was apparent that organisers underestimated the number of leaders and aspirants who would attend the meeting billed as the opposition's grand show of unity.All sitting spaces were occupied ahead of the arrival of leader Raila Odinga and his allies, who include Amani's Musalia Mudavadi, Wiper's Kalonzo Musyoka and Moses Wetang'ula of of Ford Kenya party.Aspirants for the six elective positions are expected at the event. Various groups are dancing ecstatically, dressed in the colours of parties associated with the National Super Alliance.The master of ceremony was forced to send away dignitaries who sat at the dais as they could not find space."Even MPs should not come to the dais" the distressed MC announced incessantly.Kisumu Governor Jack Raguma was taken to the latrines under heavy security. His officers pushed their way as he followed helplessly.Various youth groups also harassed aspirants as they walked to the venue.It was said they followed them amid cheers, keen on showing who they were allied to, but then asked for cash.Thousands of Kenyans are trooping to the venue for the meeting of what is shaping up to be the grand opposition coalition, that will take on President Uhuru Kenyatta in the August 8 general election.Traffic slowed others down on Lang'ata Road, forcing them to abandon their vehicles and walk to the venue.
