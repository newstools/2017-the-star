Meru Governor Peter Munya has said he will run for President in 2022.The governor said he will run for office on a PNU ticket, saying he is confident he will become Kenya&rsquo;s fifth President.Munya spoke while opening PNU offices in Thika town on Thursday. He said the party has spread its roots across the country and it would be the best bet to produce the next president in 2022.&ldquo;PNU has been in the country for the last 10 years and in 2022 it will field a presidential aspirant. By God&rsquo;s grace I&rsquo;ll contest for the presidency and I am optimistic I will win,&rdquo; hee said.The Council of Governors chairman ruled out the party&rsquo;s support for Deputy President William Ruto&rsquo;s presidential bid, saying it is undemocratic to endorse someone even before this year&rsquo;s election.He said the only partnership PNU has entered with Jubilee is to support President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s reelection. Munya added that it is a unanimous agreement by the party&rsquo;s delegates. &ldquo;Endorsing someone for the president&rsquo;s seat this early is violating democracy because it is Kenyans who will vote. We first have to vote this year and let the government work for Kenyans before sanctioning a certain individual for 2022,&rdquo; he said. The Meru county boss will face Senator Kiraitu Murungi as he seeks to retain his seat.
