Matayos traders should frogmarch to Busia Deputy Governor Kizito Wangalwa's office anyone collecting revenue from them at odd hours.The order followed complaints from traders who said some people masquerade as revenue officers and collect fees from them. They said the illegal tax collectors terrorise them. Wangalwa spoke to the traders on Thursday when he toured the market.He said genuine revenue officers are mandated to collect revenue during the day only."We will agree as a county government on specific days of tax collection instead of doing it daily," Wangalwa said.He said the county will build an urban toilet at the market."We will also ensure proper fencing of the market, undertake proper planning and installation of mass lights to enable traders operate at night," Wangalwa said.The traders also said bursary forms are being issued selectively in the area.The deputy governor said everyone has a right to get a form, but a committee makes the final decision on who is awarded the cash.Matayos South MCA Lucas Wakuloba thanked Wangalwa for taking time to listen to the traders' grievances.
