It is merely a clash of ideologies," he said.He said different parties should be praised and accommodated for furthering the cause of democracy.He congratulated Meru Governor Peter Munya for revamping PNU and taking on the party's leadership.At the same time, Mwiti termed Meru Senator Kiraitu Murungi's quest for the governor's seat a disaster since Kiraitu is the one who helped Munya ascend to power."If this attempt is coming from mercenaries who want to use Kiraitu to disorient the people of Meru, mess the county government and hurt the people, this is a misguided attempt," he said.Read: Munya wants Kiraitu to retire, says he&rsquo;ll award him with TV
