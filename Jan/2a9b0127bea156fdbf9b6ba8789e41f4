Hi, Rowan, I married my second husband after a whirlwind romance but, two years on, our sex life has almost disappeared. My husband says he loves me, but he&rsquo;s never been that focused on sex and, now he&rsquo;s in his 50s, he doesn&rsquo;t feel the urge often. What shall I do?MaggieIs there anything so disheartening as a partner whose libido goes from red-hot to tepid in the blink of an eye?The disappointment must be particularly piercing when you married in that first flush of passion, trusting that the flame would last a lifetime.You must wonder why your husband didn&rsquo;t discuss his ambivalent attitude to sex with you before you took your vows.Almost all of us are a tad self-deluding when it comes to our disappointing habits. And when you experience strong desire, it&rsquo;s almost impossible to accept that feeling might ever subside.Providing your spouse is kind and loving in other ways, I believe he didn&rsquo;t mean to let you down this badly.However, you have to be clear-sighted about the situation you find yourself in. This man says he is contented, in his 50s, with an infrequent sex life. Where&rsquo;s the real impetus for change at this stage in his life?You could take him to a sex therapist to discover underlying reasons for his lack of passion, feed him Viagra, rage and cry and make him remorseful &mdash; but it&rsquo;s verging on cruel to try to force someone to be something they&rsquo;re not.However, it&rsquo;s just as cruel to deny you an active love life. A grown-up should be able to modify their appetites to suit their partner&rsquo;s &mdash; but they shouldn&rsquo;t have to starve.Perhaps make a pact to have sex once a month, and see how you both progress?If you love one another, a shift outside of your comfort zones must be preferable to divorce.
