Learning did not take off at Technical University of Mombasa on Monday after the institution's workers went on strike in push for increased salaries.The more than 200 workers, largely members of the Kenya Union of Domestic, Hotels, Educational Institutions and Hospitals Workers (Kudheiha), want the institution to honour a CBA they signed in 2013.They were backed by their counterparts who are members of the Kenya Universities Staff Union (Kusu) and Universities Academic Staff Union (Uasu).The lot downed their tools citing failure by the government to negotiate, conclude and implement the agreement that was to be effected for four years running from 2013-17.Kudheia secretary general Albert Njeru said the school's management has failed to comply with the law despite the member's cooperation on the issue."Talks between the government and unions representing lecturers and non-teaching staff aimed at averting the planned strike collapsed on Friday," Njeru said.The union boss said they had issued TUM with a strike notice 14 days ago, which expired on Monday.Kusu TUM chapter secretary John Ogwang' said they are waiting for an official communication from their headquarters so that they also commence their strike officially."Our leaders made the announcement of the planned strike last Friday through the media and they are in the process of communicating it officially to us," Ojwang' said.Ogwang said the CBA in question must be honored without any further talks.But Prof Leila Abubakar, TUM Vice Chancellor, dismissed the strike saying that the university has met its end of the bargain since the CBA was signed in early."We've already paid them their dues. Kudheiha members who form bulk of cadre group briefly demonstrated in solidarity with others but they resumed duty," Abubakar told the Star."The matter is now being handled by the national government who we believe will come up with a counter proposal," the VC said.More on this: [VIDEO] University unions call for strike on Monday after talks on CBA collapse
