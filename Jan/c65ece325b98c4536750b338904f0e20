Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya yesterday told the Jubilee administration to stop intimidating the opposition leaders.He termed the withdrawal of security details for Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho and his Kilifi counterpart Amason Kingi &ldquo;unconstitutional and driven by panic&rdquo;.Oparanya said the governors are entitled to security. &ldquo;The national government must stop behaving as if it has monopoly over security. Security is a constitutional right only delegated to the government by the people of Kenya and not a favour or linked to parties, friendship or enmity,&rdquo; he told the Star on the phone.The government ordered the withdrawal of Joho and Kingi&rsquo;s security detail on Friday, a day after the Mombasa governor told President Uhuru Kenyatta to stop bragging about projects started by the previous regime of former President Mwai Kibaki and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga.Oparanya said the move is in reaction to Joho&rsquo;s remarks to the President on Thursday. &ldquo;Using functions to intimidate another level of government amounts to abuse of office,&rdquo; he said.Oparanya said Joho simply told the President the truth about projects, because &ldquo;he is relying on misinformation by his officers that leads to his embarrassment&rdquo;. &ldquo;The President came to Western and launched the same road twice in Navakholo and Shianda markets. He is being misled by his senior officers to do things that land him in embarrassing situations,&rdquo; he said.
