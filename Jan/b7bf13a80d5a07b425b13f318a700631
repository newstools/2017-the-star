Lawyer Simon Lilan who went missing for 12 days has resurfaced in Eldoret.He said he was hiding in a foreign embassy after police refused to protect him over threats he received.Lilan has dared the police to arrest him for allegedly giving false information. The lawyer says he will still pursue the case he filed to exhume the body of former nominated MP Mark Too to confirm the cause of his death.Lilan says he will follow up the case until he confirms that Too was not assassinated. &ldquo;I went to the police to help me serve the order blocking Too&rsquo;s burial but I was told there were no officers, yet I saw many of them collecting bribes along the road,&rdquo; he said at a media briefing in Eldoret town.Lilan said Uasin Gishu police boss Samson ole Kinne refused to cooperate with him to enforce the court orders before Too&rsquo;s burial on January 9. He obtained orders stopping the burial claiming Too may have been killed because of politics and his vast wealth.The lawyer said his brother John Tallam and advocate were also threatened by unknown people. &ldquo;I did not want to stop Too&rsquo;s burial, rather, I wanted to get a specimen from his body so that an independent probe could be done to establish what killed him,&rdquo; Lilan said.He says he wants to get to the bottom of the matter because he was Too&rsquo;s lawyer and friend.&ldquo;They say trust, but verify. My intention was to verify what the government pathologist said in his report that Too died of heart complications.&rdquo;Lilan said after the police refused to cooporate with him he discovered that they, too, are a threat to his life.&ldquo;I was also hiding from the police,&rdquo; he added.The lawyer said even President Uhuru Kenyatta advised Kenyans that their security starts with them.He questioned why the President attended Too&rsquo;s burial in Eldoret, yet he knew there wee orders stopping the event.&ldquo;I lost confidence in everyone, considering that even the President attended an illegal ceremony and he had also told Kenyans to take care of their own security,&rdquo; Lilan said.He wants Chief Justice David Maraga to investigate how orders allowing Too&rsquo;s burial were issued by the Eldoret court. The burial orders were obtained after a team of lawyers led by Tom Ojienda went to court to challenge earlier orders obtained by Lilan.
