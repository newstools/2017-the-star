Embu Senator Lenny Kivuti yesterday expressed disappointment at the poor academic development posted by boys in the county. Kivuti said for several years, the population of boys who have been advancing to higher education or taking special courses like medicine in Embu has declined. Kivuti said the problem could hurt the county&rsquo;s future development. He urged parents and teachers to intervene.
