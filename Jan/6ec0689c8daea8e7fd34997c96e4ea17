He said that the commission plans to roll out the registration of voters in the prisons from February 20 to February 27, 2017. "The commission reckoned that there would be need to develop regulations to govern the participation of prisoners in elections," Chebukati said.Read: Don&rsquo;t deny prisoners their right to voteIn 2010 the Supreme Court ruled that prisoners have the right to vote, including in national referenda.
