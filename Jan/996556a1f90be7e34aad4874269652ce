Football Kenya Federation/Kenya Premier League Joint Executive Committee (JEC) have reportedly agreed on the modalities to introduce the 18-team league that will be presented to the Sports Disputes Tribunal on Monday.The meeting at the federation headquarters saw FKF being represented by President Nick Mwendwa, his deputy Doris Petra and Nairobi NEC member Chris Amimo while KPL had chairman James Musyoki (Tusker FC), his predecessor, Ambrose Rachier (Gor Mahia) and Matahre United chairman Bob Munro.&ldquo;Yes we have come to an agreement for an 18-team league this season which we will review before our presentation to the Tribunal on Monday,&rdquo; remarked Amimo.The Tribunal had urged both parties to sit and agree by Monday, January 16 on the merits, modalities and mechanism for the expansion of the Kenyan Premiership from 16 to 18 teams for the 2017 season.The Kenyan dispute organisation also denied KPL&rsquo;s prayers to stop FKF from interfering with the league body&rsquo;s right to manage the competition.In a 21-page ruling, the Sport Dispute Tribunal ordered FKF to submit by Wednesday, January 11, names of their nominees that will sit in the JEC and discuss how to expand the league to an 18-team competition.KPL had taken their case to the Tribunal to stop FKF from expanding the league from 16 to 18 teams for the 2017 season and from interfering with the activities of the league body.In their defence, FKF argued that they had the sole right to manage the league, to decide its constitution and that therefore, allowing another party to do so would be against the statutes of the federation and those of Fifa.The Tribunal noted that any league affiliated to FKF&mdash;which is a member of Fifa&mdash; was subordinate to the federation. However, the Tribunal also noted that KPL had been given the official mandate by the federation to run the top tier league on its behalf in an agreement that was even acknowledged by Fifa.
