Amani leader Musalia Mudavadi and Ford Kenya's Moses Wetang'ula have agreed to work together ahead of the August 8 general election.The two leaders met on Monday at a Karen hotel in what has been viewed as an attempt to address differences between them.This was their first meeting since Mudavadi was declared the Luhya spokesperson at a ceremony in Kakamega on December 31, 2016.Multiple sources close to the former Sabatia MP and the Bungoma Senator said the two met for close to two hours."They agreed to have their first rally in Vihiga," the source, who is an aide of one of the two leaders, told the Star in confidence.Vihiga is Musalia's home county and is perceived to be fully behind his candidature in the August vote."Musalia briefed Wetang'ula on his recent Bungoma visit, and Wetangula also briefed him on his campaign programs," the source said.The aide described the meeting as successful, saying the two leaders will now embark on joint efforts to rally Kenyans to take part in the ongoing mass voter registration."They will further hold rallies together to drum up support for unity in the region," the aide said.The meeting comes amidst speculation of an imminent fallout among the Luhya leaders following the declaration of Mudavadi as the region's spokesman.Read: Wetang&rsquo;ula fears Mudavadi will hurt his political future &ndash; analystsThere has been word that Wetang'ula's camp have not been happy with the choice of the Amani leader as the most preferred presidential candidate.Mudavadi was, from a research sanctioned by Cotu Secretary General Francis Atwoli, named as the only person who the community allowed to engage with political outfits keen on sending President Uhuru Kenyatta's administration home after the scheduled poll.Also read: I have no time for useless arguments, Luhya spokesman Mudavadi tells rivals
