Nurses at the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital, Eldoret, will go on strike February 1. They have accused their employer of not registering a CBA negotiated three years ago.&ldquo;We went ahead to court to register ourselves after the employer (MTRH) failed but we have not succeeded because they haven&rsquo;t appeared in court,&rdquo; KNUN branch secretary Kennedy Orangi told the press yesterday.&ldquo;What they did is that they went to court to challenge our strike on grounds that we are not eligible because we are providing essential services.&rdquo;According to the CBA , the nurses demand a salary increase of 30 per cent &ndash; 20 per cent at the start of 2015 and 10 per cent last year.Orangi said the CBA was signed by the hospital&rsquo;s board in February 2015, but it has to be registered in court to be implemented.It contains non-monetary issues, including promotions, nurse administrative structure, career progression, pension and stipulated number of working hours.
