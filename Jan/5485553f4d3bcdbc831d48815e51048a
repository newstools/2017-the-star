The Musalia Mudavadi-led Amani National Congress wants publication of the names of Kenyans who have not collected their identity cards.Secretary general Godfrey Osotsi yesterday said publishing the names will enable the applicants to collect their documents so they can register to vote at the upcoming poll. The Interior ministry has said about nine million ID cards are uncollected from distribution centres across the country.&ldquo;It can help boost the numbers in the ongoing mass voter registration. It will give them an opportunity to elect their leaders come August 8,&rdquo; Osotsi said.The party has also expressed concern over multiple registration. It demands a thorough audit of the entire voters&rsquo; roll, once the mass voter registration ends.On Tuesday, the IEBC said 128,926 records share IDs. It said 107,777 have same ID but different names, while 53,671 IDs are shared more than once.Meanwhile, the party has extended the dateline for submission of aspirants&rsquo; applications and nomination forms to February 10.Osotsi said the decision had been reached to give room for a large number of public servants, who are yet to resign. He said it will foster inclusivity by not locking out any potential hopeful.&ldquo;By the said date, all ANC aspirants must have complied with our party eligibility regulations,&rdquo; Osotsi said.
