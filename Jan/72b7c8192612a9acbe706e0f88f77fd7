In it was also a promise for furnished lounges in all hospitals and full scholarships for all doctors to acquire Masters degrees and pursue other postgraduate studies.Health CS Cleopa Mailu asked health workers to be more considerate as the government is not able to implement the entire CBA at once.&ldquo;The only people who are suffering are patients, who have to dig deeper in their pockets to a access medical services in private hospitals,&rdquo; he said.More on this: State blames KMPDU for 'unfortunate' doctors strike
