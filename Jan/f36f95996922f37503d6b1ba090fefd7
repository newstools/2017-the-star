President Uhuru Kenyatta (pictured) on Thursday expressed frustration over the failure by the Mombasa government to allocate stalls to the 10,000 Kongowea traders.Uhuru said this is one of many other attempts by some leaders to sabotage various upgrades and development his government has commissioned. Traders have voiced concerns that the stalls are being sold to the highest bidders.They have further alleged the stalls have been preserved for close associates and cronies of some politicians. Uhuru bashed the county and told Mombasa Deputy Governor Hazel Katana to ensure traders are not frustrated.The government pumped Sh444 million into the completion of the retail centre&rsquo;s construction. Kongowea serves all of East Africa. Market officials say some Sh15 million is transacted daily, with more than 10,000 traders and a similar number of customers doing business. They have said the delay in allocating stalls is hurting business. Businessman Suleiman Shahbal, Nyali MP Hezron Awiti and former Kisauni MP Annania Mwaboza have said there are plans to deny stalls to genuine traders.
