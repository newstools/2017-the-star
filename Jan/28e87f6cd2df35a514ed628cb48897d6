The Opposition's unity under the National Super Alliance is frustrating attempts by Jubilee to rig the August poll, Siaya Senator James Orengo has said.Orengo said the formation of NASA has given the group sleepless nights, and that some Jubilee members have sought Raila Odinga's ear not to lock them out of the alliance. He said that the lot has been sending emissaries to Raila to consent on their call to be admitted to NASA in the event they fail in the Jubilee primaries.Orengo said at Kapiyo in Bondo on Saturday that Jubilee is already embroiled in wrangles that are threatening to tear it apart even before they hold primaries.The Siaya senator said that the mood that their rivals are jittery is evident from their constant reactions to activities organised by the NASA team."I have personally been approached by a member of the Jubilee Party who confirmed to me that the alliance was doomed to fail," he said."The person asked me to intervene so that Raila considers them when he forms the next government," Orengo said.Orengo said this in the presence of Raila, Ida Odinga, and Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga.MPs Gideon Ochanda (Bondo), Oburu Oginga (Nominated), Millie Odhiambo (Mbita) and MCA John Gare were present at the forum.Orengo at the same time told off Deputy President William Ruto against critising the opposition, asking him to first sort out the mess in their house."The DP should cease from criticising the opposition and instead look for means to stop the fall-out among the Jubilee members," Orengo said, in response to the DP's claim that the NASA team was clueless in its August 8 vote bid.Read: Opposition clueless, no longer worthy opponent, Ruto says at Jubilee meetingAlso read: Join united, focused Jubilee, Uhuru tells Kenyans at smart card launch Orengo said that the first priority for Raila, should he assume office, will be to ensure that those swindling public funds are traced and made to face the law.He at the same time encouraged youth, women, people with disabilities to ensure that they register as voters in large numbers.Speaking at a separate event, Rarieda MP Nicholas Gumbo told off Nyanza MPs against betraying Raila by only pushing for their own re-election.He said at Yala ACK on Friday that Nyanza politicians are fond of concentrating on their bids instead of campaigning for the ODM leader."The politicians are only concerned about how to get party tickets and seats. They do little on the strategies that will see Raila ascend to the throne come August," he said.
