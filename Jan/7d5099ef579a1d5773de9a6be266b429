Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo has condemned Jubilee MPs and senators for using their numbers to impose retrogressive elections laws on Kenyans.The National Assembly deputy minority leader expressed the need to take back the recently amended election laws to the joint select parliamentary committee on IEBC reforms for further deliberation.Midiwo said there is no way the country can go into the elections with the current electoral laws. &ldquo;Jubilee is hell-bent on creating disquiet in the country and that is evident with the kind of election laws they are putting in place,&rdquo; he said.Midiwo said the backup option should also be electronic, as opposed to the preferred manual method by Jubilee. On Thursday, the Senate rubberstamped the amendments on the electoral laws instituted by the National Assembly to reintroduce the manual voter identification and transmission of election results. Midiwo said such laws will act as a leeway for individuals in government to rig the elections. He said if the President signs the bill, the opposition will be forced to take to the streets.
