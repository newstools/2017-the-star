Kenya Power is still grappling with huge losses despite spending Sh10 billion in 2015 to upgrade its electricity transmission network, a survey shows.The losses are compounded by persistent electricity theft which when combined, costs the firm about Sh17.5 billion annually.Managing director Ben Chumo (pictured) said a survey carried on the company&rsquo;s network by a consultant in 2016 established that losses are still above the 19 per cent range estimated before the 2015 upgrade.&ldquo;We carried an extensive survey to establish the level of losses currently at KPLC. We established there is 19.4 per cent loss, but we are still focused to reduce it to single digit in the next five years,&rdquo; he said in an interview on the sidelines of the company&rsquo;s annual general meeting on December 23.The company spent Sh10 billion in a countrywide network upgrade project &ndash; Operation Boresha Stima &ndash; launched in August 2015.In 2014, it spent Sh1 billion in a programme &ndash; Boresha Meme Viwandani &ndash; aimed at boosting power supply in manufacturing industries. Chumo said reduction of losses is part of the firm&rsquo;s five-year power distribution masterplan that runs up to 2018.Under the strategic plan, Kenya Power plans to roll out a major grid expansion programme at a cost of Sh220 billion, where Sh110 billion will be invested to manage the losses, he said.&ldquo;We are metering feeders, substations, boundary line feeders so that we can trace losses to specific regions. Metering is the initial solution because when you know where the challenge is you can prescribe solutions,&rdquo; Chumo said. &ldquo;For example, if we will trace certain amount of losses to Mt Kenya, we will narrow down further to establish the amount of losses emerging from specific feeders and ensure the problem is fully rectified.&rdquo;Kenya Power, which has 4.8 million customers, aims to supply power to 10.8 million customers by 2021.The company expects to significantly cut down on outages in Nairobi on completion of three substations at a cost of Sh18.47 billion.The stations will provide alternative sources in case of loss of power in Nairobi, according to Chumo, which consumes more than a half of country&rsquo;s supply of electricity while generating about 70 per cent of KPLC earnings.The firm plans to install 52 new primary substations and about 1,000 distribution substations by mid 2018, which will be connected to the grid by a network of a new distribution line.
