Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago&rsquo;s rival Edward Serem has become the first to pick his running mate as the race for the county&rsquo;s top job hots up.Serem picked Pauline Olbara, an engineer, in what is seen as a bid to woo women voters.Olbara is from the Keiyo community, while Serem is a Nandi.The entry of multimillionaire businessman Bundotich Kiprop, popularly known as Buzeki, has complicated matters for Serem and Mandago.Kiprop is seen as a front runner because of his vast business, political and social connections.Mandago, Kiprop and Serem will battle it out for the Jubilee Party ticket during the party primaries in May.Former judiciary registrar Gladys Shollei will run for woman representative, and former minister Margaret Kamar is eyeing the senator seat. Their entry has sparked rivalry between the Keiyo and Nandi communities, the main Kalenjin subtribes in the region, home to Deputy President William Ruto.Ruto is said to be keenly observing the unfolding political events in the region.Kiprop, Shollei and Kamar are from the Keiyo community, but have influence within all communities in the region.Mandago is said to have been forced to go back to the drawing board with Kiprop&rsquo;s entry.&ldquo;The work we have done before is evident and we want to transform this county in a way every resident will feel the impact of our programmes,&rdquo; Kiprop said.Jubilee official Ken Kibiwott said, &ldquo;The issue of Nandi or Keiyo politics may not be very prominent. Residents will more likely focus on the ability of each of the aspirants.&rdquo;Shollei has not revealed which party she will join, but there is speculation she could seek the Kanu or Jubilee ticket.
