CIC Insurance on Friday announced full-year net earnings for the period ended December 2016 will drop by at least a quarter compared to the previous year, hurt by devaluation of investments at the Nairobi Securities Exchange. This means the composite insurer&rsquo;s net earnings will not be more than Sh855 million because it posted Sh1.14 billion in 12 months&rsquo; period through December 2015. &ldquo;The company has registered strong topline growth with improved quality of business in most of the lines of business,&rdquo; CIC said in a statement. &ldquo;However, because of the prevailing market conditions, the valuation of our shares portfolio at the Nairobi Securities Exchange has significantly dropped.&rdquo; The earnings have also been undermined by adverse claims in some of its general business, while a &ldquo;reserving policy change in our life business resulted in significant increase negatively impacting overall business performance&rdquo;, the insurer added. Meanwhile, Car and General announced a 30.11 per cent drop in full-year earnings for the period ended September 2016, pushed down by a one-off Sh46.08 million tax credit it enjoyed a year earlier. The auto and farm machine supplier said net earnings fell to Sh88.87 million from Sh127.15 million. Revenues from sales were largely flat, falling by a marginal 1.91 per cent to Sh9.74 billion from Sh9.93 billion it reported for the period ended September 2015.
