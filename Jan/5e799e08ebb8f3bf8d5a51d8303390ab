Nema's decision for the Standard Gauge Railway to cut through Nairobi National Park "sets a very dangerous precedent for other protected areas in the country". WildlifeDirect communications manager Trish Sewe said this in a statement on Tuesday, adding activities such as infrastructure construction, mining, and unregulated urban and agricultural expansion have been opened up."The decision to route the railway through the park not only goes against public opinion but also ignores the advice of numerous science experts who have warned of its irreversible consequences," said Sewe.She added that allowing the railway line to pass through the park undermines the budding conservancy movement in which hundreds of Kenyans have invested.Read: First batch of SGR locomotives arrive at Mombasa Port from ChinaThe National Environment Management Authority issued a license giving Kenya Railways the go-ahead to construct SGR Phase 2A.

It is also a refuge from city life, with incalculable benefits for millions of Nairobi residents, tourists and business people from all over the world. Nema defended its decision saying it followed the consideration of recommendations by leading agencies.Read: Sad times for wildlife as Nema approves SGR in park - expertsAlso read: Nema defends move to approve SGR park route
