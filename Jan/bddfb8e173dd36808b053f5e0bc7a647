Deputy President William Ruto is expected to be JP&rsquo;s presidential candidate.On December 13, Kimaiyo hosted ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi in Elgeyo Marakwet and sources say he has been considering the possibility of running on the ANC or Kanu ticket.Kimaiyo has camped in Elgeyo Marakwet for three months to market his bid and consult residents ahead of the launch.Previously he blamed Murkomen and Ruto for his sacking as IG and Kenya Airports Authority chairman.Murkomen, a Ruto ally, faces an uphill task in seeking reelection as he will battle more than four aspirants in the Jubilee Party primaries in April. They include businessmen Bernard Boit and Joseph Kangogo and Eldoret Water and Sanitation Company chairman Cornelius Chepsoi.
