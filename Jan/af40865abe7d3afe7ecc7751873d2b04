The Kiambu youth department has rolled out a programme to give employed boda boda operators soft loans to buy motorcycles.Governor William Kabogo said 10 motorcycles will be distributed in each ward to create jobs for the youth. &ldquo;There are riders with valid driving licences who do not own motorcycles or are unemployed. They come to the boda boda groups to ask for a trip to make some money,&rdquo; Kabogo said. He spoke at Ikinu trading centre, Githunguri subcounty, on Tuesday. Kabogo inspected county government projects and stopped to talk to residents. He urged groups that have not registered with the department or the Constituency Development Agency to do so and get a certificate. Kabogo said the county targets groups since members can guarantee each other since they know each other well and take out loans.
