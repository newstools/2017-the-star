Nyatike MP Edick Anyanga has accused ODM chairman John Mbadi of demeaning him.He spoke during a football tournament organised through the CDF kitty at Lwanda Konyango.Anyanga said it is unfortunate that Mbadi "is always hosted for cheap meals" by Governor Okoth Obado to attack him.He said Mbadi used the coronation of Obado as Uriri subcounty elder on Friday at Rapogi High School to attack him.&ldquo;I never knew cheap food could make Mbadi, who I consider sober, make statements that demean me and the people of Nyatike,&rdquo; Anyanga said.He said Mbadi attacked him because he told him and other ODM legislators named in the National Youth Service scandal to carry their own cross, without involving the party and ODM leader Raila Odinga.&ldquo;Mbadi should own up to the mess at NYS and clear his name. He was among legislators in the former budget committee who received Sh100 million from the Jubilee government,&rdquo; Anyanga said.He said Mbadi is being used by Deputy President William Ruto to cause havoc in ODM by pretending to be hand-picking aspirants.Anyanga said this has brought him at loggerheads with Migori, Siaya, Homa Bay and Kisumu leaders.&ldquo;As our chairman, Mbadi should be uniting us. But every time he attends functions organised by Obado he attacks Migori leaders to intimidate and blackmail everybody,&rdquo; he said.Anyanga said Mbadi's remarks that he has been interfering with party nominations since 2007 in Nyatike are far-fetched.&ldquo;I am not a party official like Mbadi. I am just an ordinary member and his claims are far-fetched. It was not my problem in the last polls when three Nyatike MP aspirants had ODM nomination certificates,&rdquo; he said.Nyatike youth and women ODM leaders Ouma Biu and Dorothy Otieno said Mbadi has openly supported the reelection of Luo Nyanza governors, which is not in good faith.&ldquo;Mbadi is making it hard for his juniors in the party to respect him because of his remarks. We wonder if he came to pick New Year pocket money in Migori,&rdquo; Biu said.During the Friday function, Mbadi said a sitting MP in Migori county has been inciting people against the party.He was reacting to pleas by North Kadem MCA Boaz Okoth, who was elected on the Agano Party ticket, to ensure free and fair nominations in Nyatike.&ldquo;Everybody is equal in ODM and nominations will be free and fair across the country, including Nyatike,&rdquo; he said.Mbadi said tdespite attending the coronation he was not supporting Obado's reelection. He said he was there &ldquo;to seek votes for Obado, but Migori people will make their choice&rdquo;.MPs John Kobado (Uriri), Jared Kopiyo (Awendo) and Oburu Odinga (nominated) among other guest attended.
