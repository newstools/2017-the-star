Busia woman representative Florence Mutua has offered to pay fees for an orphan from Mabinju, Bunyala subcounty.Janet Nakoolo&rsquo;s guardian was unable to raise fees so she could join Musoma ACK Secondary School. On Friday Mutua appealed to the school to enrol her, saying she will meet all her needs.&ldquo;The young girl who did her KCPE examination last year and passed had been shedding tears all day long on learning she will not be able to join secondary school for lack of fees,&rdquo; she said. Mutua commended secondary school heads in Busia for allowing 86 orphaned girls to re-enrol after they dropped out due to pregnancy and gave birth. She said she is paying from her own pocket , as the approval of the affirmative action development fund for woman reps has been delayed.
