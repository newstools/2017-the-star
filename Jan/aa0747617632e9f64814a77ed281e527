With only seven months to the election, senior government officers in Machakos have started leaving civil service positions to vie for political posts.Among them is Education chief officer Jackson Kala, who is eyeing the Machakos town parliamentary seat.Kala joins current MP Victor Munyaka and former Knut national treasurer Albanus Mutisya in the August 8 polls.Observers say Kala's entry has caused ripples in the political scene as residents have been accustomed to the latter two opponents,Kala is expected to face off with Mutisya in the Wiper Party preliminaries, while Munyaka is set to defend his seat on a Jubilee ticket.It is believed Kala used his position in Governor Alfred Mutua's government to familiarise himself with residents and establish a strong network with both youth and women.Kala first served as ICT, Labour and Public Service chief officer and while in that position, ensured deserving youths in the constituency got jobs within the county government.These links, observers say, give Kala the upper hand as he can use the network of youths to spearhead his campaigns.During his tenure in the Education, Youth and Social Welfare department, Kala has become the face of county school bursaries disbursed to needy students, the elderly, youth and women groups.More than Sh80 million has been disbursed as bursaries, Sh35 million to the elderly and about Sh10 million to women and youth groups.The 2017 run is not Kala's first foray into politics. The county officer played a key role in the election of the current MP in 2007.Kala was the main strategist in Munyaka's campaign team and used his closeness to Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka to esure Munyaka clinched the seat on the former ODM-K party.This former closeness with Kalonzo, which dates back to Kala's university days, has thrown Mutisya into a panic, analysts say.More on this: You deserted me, Machakos Town MP tells Wiper leaderMutisya, who unsuccessfully contested against Munyaka in the 2013 general elections, is said to be uncertain of clinching the Wiper ticket.It is also rumoured that Kalonzo is uncomfortable with Mutisya since he was not able to beat Munyaka in the 2013 elections even with the tag of the Wiper ticket on him.Kala has already hit the ground running where he is now meeting youth and women groups in the constituency in every weekend and it will be interesting to watch how the party nomination goes this February.
