Life has lost its meaning for Samuel Lenengole, 70, after his 14-year-old son was killed and eaten by crocodiles in Katuit village on the shores of Lake Baringo in 2014.Lenengole recalls like yesterday the moment his son, Kemoi, a pupil at Katuit Primary School, was overturned and killed while wading through the lake from Chepkenion Island.He said he had hoped his son could get good education and help lift his family out of poverty.The Star met Mzee Lenengole at the deadly shore of Lake Baringo on Saturday, wearing tyre-sandals with a Maasai sheet wrapped around his waist.A part from losing his beloved son, he said he also lost 200 goats and sheep to the crocodiles, adding that the government has never compensated him.He said the troubles began when Lake Baringo broke its banks after heavy rains in December 2013, pushing the marine beasts closer to the villages. &ldquo;I have reported the two cases and even made several follow-ups with the Kenya wildlife Service, but my efforts three years down the line have borne no fruits,&rdquo; Lenengole said.He added that he has spent Sh140,000 on cases involving his killed son and livestock.Lenengole said he has three children in secondary school and four in primary, but he wonders where he will get money to raise their school fees after almost all his livestock were killed and eaten by the crocodiles.DEATH TRAPThe sorrowful old man is not alone. Some 10 people, including schoolchildren, were reportedly injured by the crocodiles immediately after Lake Baringo broke its banks in 2014.Among them is Stephen Kigen, 14, who says he makes the dangerous journey every day to school. He had a close shave once when he met a hippo while crossing and it nudged his raft and overturned him into the lake.&ldquo;I had to swim to a tree and climb on it,&rdquo; he told the Star, who visited the school on Saturday, adding that most of his colleagues have also escaped death several times and the trees protect them a lot.However, more than 200 pupils of Katuit Primary School fear for their lives as they face dangerous crocodiles while crossing the lake daily to and from school.They are yet to receive help since the media, including the World BBC service, highlighted their story three years ago.The children, mostly from Kaparkolwo and Chepkenyon Islands, have been rowing across the lake daily using improvised rafts to attend school. Others come from Chesiran and Chesesoi villages.Prevailing drought has deprived residents of indigenous raw materials to improvise the homemade canoes, forcing the children to wade or swim through the water.A parent, John Lokol, said Baringo Governor Benjamin Cheboi had promised in 2015 to buy a motorboat for the children, but they are yet to receive it.&ldquo;We hear it has been diverted to another island in the lake. If he does not fulfill his promise in time, then we may not know his fate come August elections,&rdquo; Lokol said.He said apart from the pupils, residents&rsquo; lives are also at risk as they water and graze their livestock around the lake during the ongoing dry season.Headmaster Brian Temanyon said many children brave the risky journey to school daily, delaying their arrival as they have to wait until the daylight brightens to see the predators.&ldquo;They also arrive at school when their clothes are soaking in water after crossing the massive lake on foot,&rdquo; Temanyon said.He added that although their parents feel their children should get the quality education they need.REQUEST FOR MOTORBOATThe headmaster appealed to the government and well-wishers to intervene and give the children a modern boat to help them cross the water safely.He said the swollen lake displaced his pupils in 2013, forcing them to take their lessons outside. The government is building five classrooms but the lower primary pupils are still un-accommodated and sit on stones as they learn under tree shades.Temanyon said the ECDE classroom built by the county lacks furniture, and so the children in baby to top class take their classes while seated on the ground.&ldquo;We urge the county government to provide a feeding programme for the nursery school children, as they are now forced to share with the primary section,&rdquo; he said.Governor Cheboi said he has issued an engine-ride boat to the residents and has never received any complaint about it being diverted.&ldquo;We are sorry for Katuit Primary School children facing a dreadful stay with the crocodiles,&rdquo; he said, adding that the government shall find ways of repulsing the dangers.He said he is also aware of the poor sitting facilities of ECDE classes, saying the allocations made in 2015-16 were only enough to build some 324 ECD classrooms across the county, &ldquo;without any extra budget for desks&rdquo;.MORE LETHAL THAN DROUGHTKatuit is located in Loruk location, Tiaty subcounty, northwards of Baringo county, and 30km from Marigat town at the foot of Lake Baringo.The area is inhabited by more than 2,000 Pokots, who fear losing more lives to the killer crocodiles and hippos, whose hunger has been doubled by the ongoing harsh drought.Two weeks ago, more than 50 residents in the area reported to the media crying for help after crocodiles killed more than 70 goats over the December holiday along the shores of Lake Baringo.John Lokol, a resident from Chepkenyon Island, said the crocodiles killed five goats last week on Wednesday. &ldquo;I had just arrived home from Loruk market when my children told me that the goats were missing and I knew the crocodiles must have attacked and feasted on them,&rdquo; he said, adding that 30 of their goats have been eaten by the crocodiles since 2013.Lokol said hardly a day passes before the crocodiles attack to kill five to 10 goats, saying the deadly crocodiles pose more danger to their animals than the harsh drought.He said he has lived at the island since the 1970s but he has never heard of damage of such magnitude by the crocodiles, suspecting the submarine authorities might have sneaked in hostile species from Tana River.&ldquo;The crocodiles began stealing our animals in small quantities since 2000, then they became more dangerous until the situation got out of hand from 2013 to date,&rdquo; Lokol said.He said they could have killed the crocodiles long ago but the animals are elusive because no one has seen them attacking the goats. He said the blood and some parts of the goats are just discovered scattered on the shores of the lake.Another resident, Chemadeo Kicholom, said he has lost his 20 goats to the crocodiles. He called on the government to help them keep away the dangerous wild animals.&ldquo;I have four children in secondary school but I cannot raise their school fees for them, not because my goats have died from drought but from being feasted on by crocodiles,&rdquo; he said.The residents affected include Lokorechale Kakandich, Chepokapech Amariamoi, Joel Cherono, Lina Lochom, Samuel Lenengole, Job Lekede, Richard Kapsukun, William Lokwari, Kitem Kiruk, Mariko Sikar, Kennedy Mariamuk, Jennifer Saidi, Susan Chama and Musa Lomuita.Loruk chief Charles Samut said residents live in fear of an attack. He said owing to the long droughts, the residents have resorted to grazing their livestock along the shores of Lake Baringo, hence putting their animals at high risk of being attacked by the hungry crocodiles.He urged the government to either purchase a motorboat to transport the pupils and residents across the lake or consider relocating them to safer ground, besides compensating them for their losses.COUNTING LOSSESLoyamorok MCA Kibet Cheretei said he has made several visits to the KWS offices in Kabarnet town to report the massive loss of the residents&rsquo; livestock and Mzee Lenegole&rsquo;s son but nothing has been done.Kibet said the residents are up in arms, accusing the KWS of taking too long to arrest the stray crocodiles and compensate them for their losses.The MCA said more than 3,000 people in his ward are also living in fear of being attacked by the crocodiles, among other stray wild animals like snakes and hippos.He said the lives of Katuit Primary School pupils&rsquo; riding on temporary wooden rafts is also at stake, urging the national and the county governments to intervene.&ldquo;My people here solely depend on livestock to earn a living, and so I am urging the government through KWS to stop the killings by those crocodiles and compensate the families who lost their beloved ones to the water beasts,&rdquo; Cheretei said.He said the residents are counting millions of shillings in losses after their more than 500 goats entered into the sharp jaws of the crocodiles since 2001.County KWS warden Dickson Too denied having heard reports of such a huge number of goats killed in that time. He urged the residents to report cases immediately they happen to help officers reach out to help them.&ldquo;In as much as we would like to help our people coexist with the wildlife, we expect them also to support us by feeding us with information as it happens,&rdquo; Too said.He accused area leaders of not educating residents on the legal procedures to follow when pursuing a case against wildlife attack.
