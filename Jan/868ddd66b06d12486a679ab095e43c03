All public university vice chancellors and staff unions will meet in Nakuru on Friday to ratify a decision to have six VCs sacked.The Kenya Universities&rsquo; Staff Union, which is steering the campaign, has only named three VCs, whom it accuses of corruption, tribalism and assault.They include TUK&rsquo;s Prof Francis Aduol, Masinde Muliro&rsquo;s Prof Fredrick Otieno and Jaramogi Oginga Odinga&rsquo;s Prof Stephen Angong&rsquo;.Kusu said if the VCs refuse to resign during the meeting, it will issue a 21-day notice to the state to act, failing which it will call for mass action and disrupt all universities&rsquo; activities. Many universities are set to reopen from next week and a strike will complicate matters.Kusu secretary general Charles Mukwaya accused the MMUST VC of assault, illegal dismissal of staff and blocking employees from joining unions. The JOOUST VC is accused of unduly sacking more than 10 staff. The TUK VC is accused of tribalism.
