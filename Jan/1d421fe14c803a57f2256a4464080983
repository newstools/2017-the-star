A report on misappropriation of Sh6 million in Taita Taveta county will be ready by next week.Documents obtained by the Star show the money was to buy land at Mgeno to put up the county headquarters. A source within the anti-graft agency, who sought anonymity, told the Star two key county officials are among the six people to be prosecuted. "The report implicates some officers from Governor John Mruttu's office. We are gathering more evidence,&rdquo; he said. Two county officials have already been questioned and a report made. The report shows payments were made to suppliers and allowances paid during a groundbreaking ceremony on April 25. The Star has a copy of the list of individuals and companies alleged to have received the payments.
