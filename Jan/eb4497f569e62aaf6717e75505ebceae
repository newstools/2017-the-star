A court in Eldoret has lifted orders blocking the burial of former Nominated MP Mark Too at his farm in the area on Monday.The burial service is now underway at his Maziwa farm near Eldoret International Airport.Led by Tom Ojienda, seven lawyers representing Too's family told magistrate Nicodemus Moseti that the request to block the burial was made without the issuance of full disclosure.The request was by lawyer Simon Lilan, a relative who represented Too in some land matters.Lilan claimed the former MP may have been killed because of politics and his vast wealth. He also wanted Too's body buried at the home of his first widow Mary.Read: Security deployed at Mark Too's home despite order stopping Monday burialAlso read: Court stops Monday burial of Mark Too amid fresh 'assassination' claimsBut Ojienda said Lilan did not reveal the details of why he went to court."The orders have been vacated and the family can now proceed with burial," he said after the ruling.He was with Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago and MPs Oscar Sudi (Kapseret) and Alfred Keter (Nandi Hills).The lawyer noted that a post mortem had been carried out for the sake of investigations into the case of Too's death.It was found that he died from a heart problem but Lilan dismissed the report by chief government pathologist Johansen Oduor.Lilan also objected today's ruling saying the magistrate made a mistake in withdrawing the matter without involving him.He said his life was in danger as he had been threatened to withdraw his case."I will write to the Chief Justice to complain about the conduct of the court in handling the case," he said.He noted that he will pursue the matter until Too's body is exhumed for investigations into his death.Moseti said the case will be heard on January 12.Read: Woman says Mark Too was her son's father, wants burial stoppedAlso read: Woman seeking to stop Mark Too burial withdraws case
