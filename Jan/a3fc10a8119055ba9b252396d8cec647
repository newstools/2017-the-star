A Bishop from Kwale has warned politicians against any attempts to use witchcraft to clinch seats ahead of the August 8 general election.Bishop Wilber Gogo of Gospel Revival Churches in the Coast said that such characters will die in the process of acquiring dark forces to get votes from faithful.He said the lot will not succeed this time round since voters are determined to get God-fearing leaders, thus spelling doom on such practices.Bishop Gogo said at a Sunday that there are politicians who use powers from acts of devil worship to ascend to power.The cleric said that prayers will break and do away with rogue politicians who are not out to serve citizens but their personal interests."We are starting our prayers and fasting on Monday. Any MCA, senator, governor, MP, woman representative or presidential aspirant seeking such powers will fail terribly," he said.He said that the church will pray to ensure God puts such people to shame. "There are leaders who go to witchdoctors to be initiated. Let them be careful this time for they will get wounds that will not heal. Those taking drugs from witchdoctors will die there," he warned.The clergyman also urged the church to pray so that the country experiences a free, fair and credible election to avert possible post-election violence."We have countries like Ghana which conducted their election without rigging. We can defeat all this irregularities through prayers," he added.
