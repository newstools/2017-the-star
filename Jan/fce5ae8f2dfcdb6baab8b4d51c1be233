Claims that some ODM governors have secretly drawn up lists of their preferred candidates have alarmed some aspirants.The county chiefs reportedly have identified their own line-ups for MPs and MCAs, opening a new war-front with aspirants. Hopefuls who spoke to the Star said the matter must be addressed urgently in the interest of fairness.&ldquo;Nominations must be free and fair all over. We&rsquo;re not going to accept intruders imposed by governors, yet they&rsquo;ve never done anything for the party and have never been members,&rdquo; South Mugirango MP hopeful Sylvanus Osoro told the Star.&ldquo;Our appeal to the party is to stand firm for its youthful soldiers to avoid voter apathy,&rdquo; The governors are said to be pushing Cord leader Raila Odinga to support their line-ups. Also protesting against the move are party loyalists, who asked why the governors support people who have done little or nothing to build the party.&ldquo;The intentions of some of the governors will have a negative effect on the presidential bid if not checked Kitutu Chache South MP aspirant Anthony Kibagendi said.&ldquo;They&rsquo;re fronting individual interests against those of the party and Kenyans. This is very bad.&rdquo; Those in the know see this as a bare-knuckle approach by the wealthy and influential governors to punish their critics and silence people with divergent views by using blackmail and intimidation.ODM chairman John Mbadi has, however, dismissed the reports, saying the party will not issue direct nominations.&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve said it before and insist that the party will not give free party nominations. The process remains very competitive,&rdquo; he said.A good number of aspirants did not want to be quoted fearing a backlash from the party. The Star learnt that the county bosses have fronted lists of their honchos well ahead of the primaries next month.Two months ago they held a two-day, closed-door meeting with the opposition chief in Naivasha to root for their own direct tickets.The disgruntled hopefuls believe the governors want to use their preferred candidates to consolidate their bastions at the grassroots should they clinch the ODM ticket and win on August 8.&ldquo;A good number of them fear being challenged. They&rsquo;re employing uncivilised means to isolate young independent minds,&rdquo; Kibagendi said.
