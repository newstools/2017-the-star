The highway authority has been barred from erecting mobile weigh bridge toll stations on the Thika-Garissa highway.This is after 30 petitioners filed a certificate of urgency seeking orders to stop KeNHA from erecting mobile weight bridges.Kiambu High Court judge Joel Ngugi has on Monday given KeNHA seven days to set up a permanent weigh bridge operating base and communicate the same with clients and interested parties.James Mburu, a petitioner, lauded the ruling saying the temporary weigh bridges were illegal."We have also been robbed by thugs and other unscrupulous people who have taken advantage of the presence of the weigh bridges to attack us," he said.In their case, the petitioners raised 12 grounds from the Traffic Act, National Police Force Act, Weights and Measures Act and Access to Information Act.They argued that KeNHA's actions were in contravention with their fundamental rights, including freedom of movement.They also cited arbitrary deprivation of interest and a violation of their right over property.The petitioners said the mobile weight bridges posed a security risk as they were placed arbitrarily and manned by non-uniformed officers at odd hours.They also accused officers of harassment and extortion.Read: Nakuru leaders want weighbridge removed
