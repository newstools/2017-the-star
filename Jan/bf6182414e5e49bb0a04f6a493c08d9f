Banks, school uniform shops, bookshops and bus station were yesterday congested as city residents prepare to take their children back to school. Last year, Education CS Fred Matiang'i directed all schools to open within the first week of January. Chris Mutua, a student at St Mary's Kibabii High School, Bungoma, said he had been at the Machakos Bus Station for six hours, but was yet to get transport back to school. "I came from Machakos and arrived here at 7am, but their were no buses to Bungoma," he said.School uniform trader Jemimah Wairimu said business is good as many parents have filled up the shop. Wairimu said that they had sold out more than half of their supplies in the past two days and had made more orders as they expect more customers. "We have been working for the past two days and have made good sales," she told the Star.Parents have, however, complained of hiked prices on items required by their children. &ldquo;The prices of uniforms and textbooks have been hiked," parent Rebecca Ongeri said.But uniform traders have defended the increased prices, saying the high demand has forced them to make quick orders from distributors, resulting to high prices.
