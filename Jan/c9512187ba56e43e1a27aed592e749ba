The National Police Service yesterday received 500 assorted vehicles to improve their ability to respond to distress calls.The vehicles were procured in the third phase of the NPS vehicle leasing programme started by the Jubilee government in 2013.President Uhuru Kenyatta yesterday said the 500 vehicles, including trucks, pickups and saloon cars, increases the number of vehicles hired to 2, 720.He spoke at Uhuru Park, where he flagged off the vehicles.Uhuru said the leased vehicles have enabled them to protect Kenyans and their property to ensure socioeconomic growth.&ldquo;When my administration came into office four years ago, our country was facing serious security problems caused by terrorism and other forms of organised crime. We had to use innovative ways to tackle these issues,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;I appreciate we have not done enough yet, but police mobility has significantly improved. Our officers across the country are able to respond faster to distress calls and the public feels safe because of the enhanced presence of the police in every corner of our country.&rdquo;Uhuru said lack of transport has hurt the effectiveness of police.He said the NPS has 3,155 vehicles countrywide, most of which were declared write-offs in 2013.&ldquo;The sorry state of affairs made police unable to execute their mandate,&rdquo; the President said.&ldquo;To deal with this problem, I adopted the NPS vehicle leasing programe and acquired 1,200 vehicles. We received 1,020 vehicles in the second phase.&rdquo; The vehicles include 25 Mines Resistant Armoured Personnel Carriers for use in operational areas.Some of the APCs are already in use in Lamu county in the Operation Linda Boni by GSU officers.Uhuru said his government has increased the police vehicles to 5,875. Police helcopters have been increased from one to three. &ldquo;The enhanced mobility has gone a long way in enabling our police to provide security for sustainable socioeconomic development,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;This is not the end, but rather a continuation of what we intend to do to ensure we have enough vehicles to satisfy the security needs of our country.&rdquo;He said the state will provide more modern equipment. Uhuru said the number of police officers has increased.He directed the police to deal with people who incite citizens and make divisive remarks.
