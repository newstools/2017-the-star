MPs have slashed money allocated to counties by Sh8.1 billion, sidestepping a recommendation by the National Treasury to give the devolved units more money in 2017-18.This is despite governors asking for more resources and MPs&rsquo; own admission previously that the devolved units are being underfunded by the Treasury.They allocated counties Sh291 billion in the Budget Policy Statement prepared by the Budget and Appropriations Committee and approved by the National Assembly in December last year.The Treasury, in the 2017-18 Budget Policy Statement, had proposed that the 47 counties share Sh299.1 billion up from Sh280.3 billion the previous year, an increase of 6.7 per cent.The Commission for Revenue Allocation had proposed that devolved units be allocated sharable revenue of Sh331.6 billion, an 18.3 per cent growth from the 2016-17 allocation.The Treasury had reduced the CRA proposal down to Sh299.1 billion with a justification that allocation to devolved units should only increase by inflation rate of 6 per cent.Treasury says inflation at the national government increases by 13 per cent, which was the revenue increase.But budget and economic experts, who advise legislators as they scrutinise the budget, pointed out crucial gaps in the budget policy statement.Last December, they said that while the Treasury claims the amount of money to be shared by the 47 counties will increase by 6.7 per cent, the increase was not real as it would be wiped out by the increase in prices.&ldquo;With the current inflation at about 6.5 per cent, the increment for the counties will only cover the changes in prices and thus no benefit of the increased sharable revenue will be enjoyed by the county governments,&rdquo; the Parliament Budget Office said.MPs argued that Treasury was being unfair using two different rates for increasing county expenditure and central government expenditure.The budget committee noted that the Sh18.8 billion hike in allocation to counties comparing what counties got in the last financial only cover changes in prices given the current inflation rate.This means there are no additional resources &ldquo;in real terms&rdquo;, the committee said.MPs are expected to debate the County Allocation of Revenue Bill 2017 and the Division of Revenue Bill 2017 when Parliament reconvenes on January 24.
