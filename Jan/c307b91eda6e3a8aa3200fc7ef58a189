Deputy President William Ruto yesterday assured Kenyans the general election will be held as scheduled. He accused the opposition of trying to create a crisis.He said the opposition should stop creating excuses on preparedness for the election with the aim of causing a delay. &ldquo;The Constitution says Kenyans will vote in August this year and the polls will go on as scheduled,&rdquo; Ruto said.The DP questioned why the opposition is fighting manual voter identification, yet all processes in preparation for elections are done manually.&ldquo;The opposition has always introduced roadblocks. They complained about the IEBC, which has been disbanded, now they are complaining about manual backup system. I can tell you without fear of contradiction that these are just excuses to delay the election,&rdquo; Ruto said.He said the opposition has no clear agenda for the country and is not prepared for election. &ldquo;Those in the opposition know well they cannot compete with Jubilee on the basis of performance and delivery of manifesto. That is why they are looking for excuses, but we want to tell them they should be ready for elections in August,&rdquo; Ruto said.Addressing a delegation of leaders from Trans Nzoia county at his Sugoi home in Uasin Gishu county, the DP said some persons with disabilities could not be identified electronically and their concerns must be addressed.&ldquo;Some disabled persons have no biometric identification features and have a right to vote like the rest of Kenyans through the manual system,&rdquo; Ruto said. He dismissed those calling for the postponement of the election, saying such individuals have sensed defeat.The leaders said they have decided to support Jubilee because it has the interests of Kenyans at heart. They urged Kenyans to support the government because it has what it takes to lead the country to further heights of economic prosperity.Cabinet Secretaries Eugene Wamalwa (Water) and Charles Keter (Energy), as well as MPs Robert Pukose (Endebbes), Janet Nangabo (woman rep), Lazarus Wafula (Saboti), Wesley Korir (Cherangany), Governor Jackson Mandago (Uasin Gishu) and former minister Noah Wekesa were present.
