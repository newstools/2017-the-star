The IEBC is investigating accusations by Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka that another voter was registered with his national ID at Wajir.Kalonzo, while at Wagberi Primary School in Wajir East constituency, found his ID belongs to Salome Wanjiru Njoroge, born in 1993."We are looking into the alleged mix up in regard to Hon Musyoka's registration. No cause for alarm," IEBC said via twitter on Wednesday.The electoral agency assured Kenyans that the register will be credible and verifiable.On Wednesday, Kalonzo said the revelation was clear evidence of a wider scheme to rig the August 8 general elections in favour of Jubilee."This [also] explains why the Registrar of Persons has retained office several years after attaining the retirement age," he said.Speaking at the same venue, Bungoma senator Moses Wetang'ula said elections are not stolen in a single day."Rigging is a process and this is it," he said.The leaders warned the IEBC that the opposition will not settle for anything short of a free, fair and credible election.Read: Kalonzo accuses IEBC of rigging as his ID is listed to woman in WajirAlso read: Failure of BVR kits 'a ploy' to allow manual backup - RailaThe IEBC listed more than 80,000 voters on day one of its mass registration exercise, CEO Ezra Chiloba said.Chiloba said at least 2,000 people were registered in each of the 47 counties when phase two of the listing officially began on Monday.More on this: IEBC launches mass voter registration phase 2, targets six million
