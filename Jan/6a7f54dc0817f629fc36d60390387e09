Martin McGuinness has resigned as Northern Ireland's deputy first minister in protest against the handling of a botched energy scheme that could cost taxpayers &pound;490m.He cited the Democratic Unionist Party's (DUP) conduct over the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scheme scandal as the main reason.The Sinn F&eacute;in MLA's decision to quit is likely to lead to a snap election.Outgoing First Minister Arlene Foster said his move was "not principled".The RHI scandal has been centre stage in politics in Northern Ireland over the past month, with DUP leader Foster facing repeated calls to resign - all of which she has rejected.She set up the RHI scheme in 2012 when she was enterprise minister in an attempt by the Northern Ireland Executive to encourage production of heat from renewable sources rather than fossil fuels.But flaws in setting the scheme's subsidy rate left it open to abuse as claimants could earn more cash the more fuel they burned, with the overspend estimated to be almost half-a-billion pounds.
