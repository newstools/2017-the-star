An investigating officer has been summoned to court over the whereabouts of nine suspects arrested on New Year&rsquo;s Eve at the Likoni Crossing Channel. The suspects were armed with pangas, knives and hammers and were allegedly about to commit crimes at Mama Ngina, where residents had converged to usher in the New Year. Only five of the 14 suspects held were brought to court and charged with preparation to commit a felony. Benjamin Ngunga, Daniel Lengale, Elijah Mwanja, Richard Adizze and Yakubu Abdul were accused of being armed on December 31 at Likoni, Mombasa. Abdul pleaded guilty and is awaiting sentencing. The other four denied the allegations and were remanded until today. Chief magistrate Douglas Ogoti summoned investigating officer Aden Adow attached to Likoni police station to explain why he had failed to produce the rest of the suspects. Adow is expected in court on today.
