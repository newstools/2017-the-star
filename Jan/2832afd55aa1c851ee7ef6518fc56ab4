Nairobi will get a new transport monitoring and control system in September that will prevent the frequent gridlocks in the city and bribe demands for traffic offences, an official has said.The Intelligent Traffic System is part of the Nairobi Urban Transport Improvement Programme funded by the World Bank and the government at a cost of Sh1.4 billion. The project will be overseen by the Kenya Urban Roads Authority and implemented in phases from September.&ldquo;The system will reduce human interface and help in the collection of useful data for decision-making. We expect drastic change in driving behaviour among motorists as traffic offenders will have no option but pay fines rather than bribe,&rdquo; Kura acting director general Silas Kinoti said.He told the Star that the project began with the development of a tele-document to guide implementation, developed by HP Gauff Consultants. &ldquo;We have hired HP Gauff Consultants to design, develop tender documents, build capacity and supervise the implementation of modern ITS in Nairobi for the next five years,&rdquo; Kinoti said.The company is also expected to train experts to control the system and oversee its operations, he said.&ldquo;The first phase is planned to begin in September after HP Gauff awards the tender to the right company that will oversee implementation of its tele-document,&rdquo; Kinoti said.The first phase of the project targets installation of a modern traffic signal system in 100 major junctions, he said.The city has 400 junctions, a major cause of gridlocks, Kinoti said.Gauff will also oversee the construction of a modern Operation Centre that will house engineers, system specialists, traffic police officers and the county traffic controllers who will monitor the system, he added.Kinoti said the traffic system will increase revenue for the national and county governments.
