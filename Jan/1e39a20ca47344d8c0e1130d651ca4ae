An additional 1.1 million Kenyans are expected to go to bed hungry by April due to the ongoing drought.Already, 1.3 million are contending with with pangs of hunger, a number the Kenya Red Cross Society says is set to hit 2.4 million.KRCS special programmes manager Leila Chepkemboi says failure of short rains between October, November and December last year is likely to make matters worse.&ldquo;By April, 2.4 million people could be without food. All signs point to that fact,&rdquo;Chepkemboi says.Already, the situation is almost getting out of hand in eight counties, namely: Garissa, Lamu, Kilifi, Kwale, Mandera, Marsabit, Samburu and Tana River.Chepkemboi says the production indicators in crops and livestock have deteriorated and, in some cases, exploded into a full-scale conflict over fight of the scarce resources.Grim statistics from the National Drought Management Authority released November last year back up this assessment.Another prediction by the Famine Early Warning Systems Networks (Fews-Net) also points to a bleak future. According to statistics from the National Drought Management Authority, Lamu county received minimal rainfall in November.This made the vegetation condition below normal, as compared to the previous Novembers of the same period.According to the statistics, agro -pastoral, fishing, irrigated cropping, fisheries and mangroves were declining at an alarming rate and are set to worsening.The state of water sources in Lamu was poor across most livelihood zones, and the situation could deteriorate.Areas severely affected were Pandanguo, Bargoni, Selini, Kibokoni, Siyu, Mtanga-wanda and Kiunga among others.The main water sources last November were: Shallow wells: 33.3 per cent, followed by piped water system at 22.2 per cent, while boreholes, traditional river wells, pans and dams and rivers accounted for 11.1 per cent each.And as the drought took its toll, an influx of livestock from Garissa and Tana River counties was observed moving to agro-pastoral livelihood zones of Bargoni in Hindi, migrating to Lamu East areas of Milimani, Mangai and Mararani in search of pasture. This is because there was fair pasture and browse in Basuba, Boni area of Lamu East.AID DELIVEREDChepkemboi sees some of these signs as just the beginning.And as interventions,Amu received 84 bags of rice, 21 bags of beans and seven cartons of cooking oil, while Mpeketoni received 150 bags of rice, 37 bags of beans and nine cartons of carton oil in the form of relief foods.Hindi received 84 bags of rice, 21 bags of beans and seven cartons of cooking oil, while Witu received 84 bags of rice, 21 bags of beans and seven cartons of cooking oil.In Tana River county, the average distance (one way) from the households to the main water sources in the month of November was 3.5km.The average distances covered by livestock from grazing areas to the main water sources in November were 15.1km.In general, a mortality rate of 5 per cent for cattle and 3 per cent of sheep has been reported.In most parts of the delta, rain-fed crops wilted on-farm due to low soil moisture as a result of early cessation and low precipitation of the last seasonal rains.The percentage of children under the risk of malnutrition in November was 13.22 per cent.In Kilifi county, Ganze, Malindi, Magarini and Kilifi North, Rabai and Kaloleni subcounties recorded extreme vegetation deficit last November.The pasture condition remained poor in the food and cash crop zones, while in the mixed farming and livestock farming zones, it remained depleted.This led to intra-migration in the livestock farming zone in search of pasture and water.Livestock were migrating to Giriama and Hussein dairy ranch in Ganze subcounty and ADC Galana-Kulalu/Tsavo ranch in Magarini and Malindi subcounties.The main water sources for domestic and livestock use across all livelihood zones in November were pipeline ( 48 per cent), water trucks ( 26 per cent) natural rivers and river wells ( 16 per cent) and boreholes/shallow wells ( 5 per cent), pans/dams ( 5 per cent).The longest average return distance was recorded in the livestock farming zone with an average of 13km, while the shortest average distance was recorded in the cash cropping zone with 4.6km. Livestock in the ranching zones of Ganze, Kaloleni and Magarini had become emaciated, with bones poking out of their bodies.In Mandera county, the rainfall was inadequate and poorly distributed across all livelihood zones in both space and time.Mandera West is in the severe vegetation deficit category.Pasture was depleted in Lafey, Mandera South and Mandera East subcounties, while poor in Banisa, Mandera West, and some parts of Mandera North subcounties.Poor livestock prices hurt pastoral returns, affecting food security at household level.LIVESTOCK DYINGCases of cattle and goat deaths due to unknown disease had been reported in areas of Kutayu, Boji,Burmayo, Shimbir Fatuma, Qalanaqalesa, Dololo, and Darsa Damu sublocations.The main water sources for the county were Earth pans, boreholes, shallow wells, River Daua and underground water tanks.Of the available water sources in November, most households used boreholes ( 42 per cent) and earth pans ( 31 per cent).In Samburu county, the deterioration in rangeland conditions had been observed in November across the livelihood zones, with pastoral areas of Samburu East and North dwindling into severe vegetation deficit.The quantity of pasture still remained poor in the pastoral zones of Samburu East and in most areas of Samburu North, especially Ndoto and Nyiro wards, due to influx of cattle converging at Waso Rongai.The three major water sources during the period under review were traditional river wells, borehole and pans and dams.Water from traditional river wells contributed 47 per cent compared to 29 per cent in last month.Boreholes and pans contributed 23 per cent and and dams 17 per cent, while springs and natural rivers remained at 12 per cent each.Return trekking distances by households to access water significantly decreased from 7km in October to 4 km in November.However, livestock in Westgate area trekked 19km from grazing fields to water points.CHILDREN&rsquo;S MALNUTRITIONThe malnutrition rates for under-five children remained high, with prevalence of children at risk of malnutrition standing at 26.4 per cent compared to 25.86 per cent recorded in October.High cases of children at risk of malnutrition continued to be noted in Kawop sentinel site, recording 44.6 per cent compared to 48.9 per cent, followed by Lodung&rsquo;okwe at 32.3 per cent.Chepkemboi says there have been deaths of livestock in various parts.&ldquo;What we are doing now is to buy the weak but healthy animals, slaughter and distribute the meat to the most vulnerable,&rdquo; she said.And the drought continues to take its toll. Conflicts as a result of the scramble for resources have already been witnessed in Laikipia, Kitui border in an area called Ngomeni, Turkana in an area called Kainuki, and at the Marakwet-Pokot border.Chepkemboi says insecurity and conflicts are largely due to drought that has ravaged most parts of the country, with arid and semi-arid areas bearing the brunt.She says the drought appeal by the society has only mobilised 10 per cent of what they need to respond to some of the most pressing needs.&ldquo;Kenyans should come out and support their fellow Kenyans to save lives and livestock,&rdquo; she said, adding that they have only mobilised Sh40 million. The society needs about Sh400 million.The Red Cross, whose Mpesa PayBill number is 10,000, wants to reach up to 110,000 people in dire need of help.Some of the donations have reached beneficiaries through cash transfer.Chepkemboi says 17,400 beneficiaries have benefited from cash transfers, with each beneficiary getting Sh3,000 per month.The society has expanded its cash transfer programme to Marsabit county, seeking to help 9,000 households over the next four months.Areas being targeted are in Loyangalani and Korr in Laisamis subcounty, as well as North Horr and Illeret wards in North Horr subcounty.Chepkemboi said cash transfer has proven effective, as there are no logistics involved.COPING STRATEGIESWhere food is scarce, the coping strategies employed include opting for less preferred or cheaper meals, reduced quantity of food consumed by adults to ensure children eat, and taking fewer meals. This is likely to cause malnutrition, common in arid and semi-arid counties.&ldquo;The Smart survey has not been done as it has always been done in July due to ongoing drought, but it may be done in February,&rdquo; she said.According to the latest data by the Red Cross Society, malnutrition levels in 11 counties are either &ldquo;extremely critical or serious&rdquo;.This is as a result of decline in food stocks and household incomes.
