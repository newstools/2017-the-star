The Ministry of Industry and Trade insists Kenya's investment climate is stable, downplaying rising fears of firms closing shops.This follows a projection by industry players, including the Kenya Association of Manufacturers, which have raised concerns over possible closure of industries as a result of increased competition from cheap imports, reduced output and dwindling investment opportunities for businesses.These, and the upcoming August 8 general election have been cited as a possible hindrance to the sector&rsquo;s growth as investors adopt a "wait-and-see" approach, which will slow down new investments this year. However CS Adan Mohamed yesterday said the government is proactive in its efforts to support local companies, to ensure Kenya maintains its positive economic growth trajectory.&ldquo;Recent reports in the media have been highlighting select closures of businesses in the country. Whilst there have been instances of such closures, it is important to note that the steady growth of our economy that has averaged six per cent has been way above the global average of three per cent,&rdquo; Mohamed said.The CS, who spoke at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, said the country has in the past three years recorded more than 300 per cent growth in investments. He said the government has reduced the cost of production by cutting the price of electricity by increasing its supply. The CS said they have also lowered logistics-related costs by enhancing efficiency at the Port of Mombasa and expanding its capacity.The CS said the standard gauge railway that is coming on-stream later this year will further reduce time to transport goods.Ongoing construction of roads will also improve business margins and sustaining businesses, he said.
