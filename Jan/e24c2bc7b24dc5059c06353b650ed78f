Meru Governor Peter Munya&rsquo;s PNU is preparing to take on the Jubilee Party in Kirinyaga county.Yesterday, PNU branch chairman Bishop Cyrus Githaka told the Star three governor hopefuls, some sitting and aspiring MCAs and MP aspirants want to run on the party&rsquo;s ticket.He said a sitting MP afraid of being rigged out in the JP primaries has also shown interest in the party.Githaka declined to divulge the names of sitting leaders seeking the PNU ticket. There is speculation Kirinyaga Governor Joseph Ndathi, who has raised concerns the JP smart card could be used to rig the primaries, could jump ship to PNU.Githaka said, &lsquo;&rsquo;The JP smart card will fail because many citizens are not ICT savvy.&rsquo;&rsquo; The smart card was launched at Kasarani, Nairobi, on January 13. It aims to ensure free and fair nominations. JP said the card will ensure only registered voters who are genuine members of the party participate in the nominations.It is also supposed to ensure no one votes twice, through a system that is integrated with the voters register database.The card contains a member&rsquo;s name, identity number, mobile contacts and voting details including the polling station.As President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President launched the smart card in Kasarani, Munya was opening three PNU offices in Kirinyaga county. The offices are in Kimbimbi, Baricho and the head office in Kutus town.Munya is set to open three more offices in Kirinyaga next week. He will open offices at Kianyaga in Gichugu constituency, Kandongu in Mwea and Kerugoya town on Wednesday next week.Githaka urged residents to turn out in large numbers to list as voters.He said PNU has recruited more than 1,000 members in Kirinyaga.
