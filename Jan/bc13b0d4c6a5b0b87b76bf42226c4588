The Court of Appeal judges yesterday accused lawyers in Nairobi of laxity.Judges Philip Waki, Roselyne Nambuye and Patrick Kiage said the lawyers are dragging cases. Waki said they will take up the matter with the registrar as they are stationed in Nyeri, but had travelled to Nairobi to clear a backlog of cases. Kiage, during the hearing of a case between the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission and its former deputy boss Wilson Shollei, said they are disappointed in lawyers Emmanuel Wetangula and Nixon Sifuna for not filing submissions for the case. Wetangula is representing the IEBC, while Sifuna is for Shollei. &ldquo;The appeal is adjourned with disappointment. Counsels&rsquo; endemic problem of not filing submissions so that cases can be concluded has to be stopped,&rdquo; Kiage said.In the case, the IEBC has moved to the Court of Appeal after the Labour Relations and Employment Court judge Maureen Onyango nullified the sacking of Shollei.The judge gave back Shollei his job, saying he had been sacked unfairly. She said, however, the judgment should hang in abeyance pending the determination of a criminal case facing him. Shollei, Edward Karisa (director Finance), Dismas Ong&rsquo;ondi (director Information Technology) and Willy Kamanga (procurement manager) were sent packing over irregularities in the purchase of voter identification devices during the 2013 general election.
