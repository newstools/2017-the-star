Wiper activist Simon Adalla has said mass action will force President Uhuru Kenyatta to veto the controversial Elections Laws (Amendments) Act 2016. This is after Jubilee senators outvoted their Cord counterparts 24 to 19 following a heated debated that extended past 8pm on Thursday to pass the amendments after the second reading.Adalla expressed disappointment on both Senate and the National Assembly for failing to put the interest of the nation first.He said public hearings initiated by the Senate outlined the public mood on the matter, highlighting that they were objected to the changes.Among the amendments in contention is the provision of a manual back up for identification of voters and also the transmission of election results. This is despite the parent law recognising a backup system that is electronically enhanced.

Besides mass action, the opposition may move to court to block the President from assenting the law.Next Wednesday Cord will convene a major meeting at the Bomas of Kenya to decide its next move. It will include all opposition governors and other elected leaders and aspirants.Read: Cord moves to court, wants planned election laws debate suspendedAlso read: Stop passing laws to 'steal elections', Raila tells MPs, Senators at Keen's burial
