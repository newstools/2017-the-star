Former TNA secretary general Onyango Oloo has said he will not be cowed by Jubilee&rsquo;s threats after defecting.Oloo on Saturday said joining ODM is the best decision since the opposition has higher chances of forming the next government.The former Jubilee official said he could not afford to be left out and risk not enjoying power in the next government. He said he does not regret joining opposition leader Raila Odinga&rsquo;s ODM party.Oloo said he is used to enjoying power, which is the reason why he is preparing to support Raila&rsquo;s presidential bid through thick and thin.&ldquo;I left Jubilee in open daylight because I have seen light at the end of the tunnel,&rdquo; Oloo said amid cheers.He spoke at the funeral of Janet Midiwo, the sister-in-law of Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo, in Gem constituency.Oloo said he was hoodwinked to believe the Jubilee administration is like the biblical Moses taking the Israelites to the promised land, only to realise the stewards were &ldquo;hypocrites&rdquo;.&ldquo;I entered a ship destined for Canaan only to realise it contained conmen and corrupt individuals who are ransacking our pockets,&rdquo; he said. Oloo added that the ship is now sinking. He said Jubilee is losing its clout in its vote strongholds.The vocal lawyer said the only person who could salvage the ship from sinking further is Raila, adding that the electorate needs to vote for him overwhelmingly to deny President Uhuru Kenyatta a second term in office. He said he has a dossier and is ready to use it against Jubilee.Siaya Senator James Orengo and Midiwo told Oloo not to be scared of Jubilee&rsquo;s intimidation, saying they are inconsequential. MPs Gideon Ochanda (Bondo), Joash Olum (Lang&rsquo;ata, Aduma Owuor (Nyakach), Nicholas Gumbo (Rarieda) and Christine Ombaka (Siaya woman rep) were present.
