We filled the relevant forms, but we are yet to be registered as voters,&rdquo; inmate Thomas Movara said.Mruttu promised to fast track the process to ensure prisoners are allowed to elect their leaders.&ldquo;It is your fundamental right to vote, therefore, in partnership with other governors, I will take up this issue with the relevant authorities and hold discussions with the Senate,&rdquo; the Council of Governors vice chairman said.On Sunday, Mruttu held interactive sessions with 144 inmates at Taveta Prison to motivate them.He said discussions are in progress with prisons commander on relocating the correctional centres from the central business district to allow use of the land for commercial purposes.Taveta, Voi and Wundanyi prisons are in the middle of the towns.
