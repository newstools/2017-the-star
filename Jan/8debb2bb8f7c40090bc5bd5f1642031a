The embattled African Independent Pentecostal Church of Africa (AIPCA) Archbishop Amos Mathenge Kabuthu has been urged to retire honourably to end the church&rsquo;s leadership disputes.He has reached the retirement age of 70 and elections were held on January 9 to choose his replacement.But some church leader, including Kabuthu, rejected Bishop Julius Njoroge who won the election. The clerics said the poll was not credible and many delegates were not allowed to participate.Kabuthu said he will not retire until credible election are held and that the board has given him one more year in his post.But on Sunday, some clerics and church members attending Njoroge&rsquo;s thanksgiving ceremony asked Kabuthu to save the church from the agony of infighting and shame by stepping down for Njoroge.Political leaders too called for a truce between the wrangling leaders in the church.
