Children under the age of five in eight counties could be at risk of malnutrition, as about two million Kenyans stare at starvation from next month.The National Drought Management Authority has said Baringo, Isiolo, Mandera, Marsabit, Meru, Samburu, Turkana and Wajir counties have reported malnutrition rates above 15 per cent. Meru has the highest rate at 28 per cent and Mandera 26.3.Embu, Garissa, Baringo and Samburu counties, which experienced some of the highest rates of malnutrition in previous month &ndash; at 52, 32, 25 and 23 per cent &ndash; have now reported improved trends.Devolution CS Mwangi Kiunjuri on Thursday said the drought is worsening and the government has set aside Sh21.4 billion to reduce its impact.&ldquo;In many counties, the food security situation is worse now than before the short rains began. In four counties in the Coast and the southeast, where the preceding long rains were also poor, the consequences are particularly severe,&rdquo; he said.Kiunjuri said the funds will be disbursed in three phases and will be distributed to the livestock, agriculture, water, health and nutrition, interior, special programmes and drought coordination sectors.&ldquo;Sh5.4 billion for the first phase as at November 2016 to January this year, Sh9 billion for phase two from February to April and Sh7 billion from May to July for both short-term and long-term measure,&rdquo; he said.NDMA chief executive officer James Oduor said the number of people in the ASALs requiring immediate relief assistance is likely to rise significantly above the 1.3 million presently being supported.&ldquo;Without urgent and appropriate action, a crisis on the scale of the 2011 drought situation is likely to occur,&rdquo; he added.Oduor said the number of counties affected by drought from October 2016 has risen from five to 12 this year.They include Garissa, Isiolo, Kilifi, Kwale, Lamu, Mandera, Marsabit, Samburu, Tana River, Turkana, Wajir and West Pokot.Last year, five Coast counties &ndash; Kilifi, Lamu, Tana River, Kwale and Taita Taveta &ndash; were the worst hit.Livestock are dying in Garissa, Lamu, Marsabit, Samburu and West Pokot.
