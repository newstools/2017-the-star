Uasin Gishu governor aspirant Edward Serem (pictured) has said he cannot let down his supporters by stepping down for and supporting billionaire businessman Bundotich Kiprop.Serem said he is in the race to the end and is well-prepared to face off with the incumbent Jackson Mandago and Kiprop, popularly known as Buzeki, in the Jubilee Party primaries in May.&ldquo;Buzeki has not personally approached me, but I have been told of such suggestions. There are those who have suggested that I team up with Buzeki as his running mate, but that is not possible,&rdquo; Serem said.&ldquo;I joined the race very early and I have campaigned in virtually all areas. I did not join the race because of an individual but my deep desire to serve the residents of Uasin Gishu.&rdquo;Serem has already named Engineer Pauline Olbara as his running mate. He will soon resign as Nandi chief officer of Health to focus on campaigns, he said.Buzeki&rsquo;s entry has complicated the race for governor because of his extensive business and social links in the region that is home to DP William Ruto. He has held several meetings to plot his political strategies ahead of the Jubilee Party nominations.Last week, Mandago denied that he was linked to the disruption of a meeting convened by Buzeki at Ziwa market in Uasin Gishu.He said all aspirants are free to participate in elections.The meeting was disrupted by a group of youths who stormed the venue and beat up residents, causing Buzeki and other guests to leave.Buzeki refused to comment.
