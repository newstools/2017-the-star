Zari Hassan just welcomed her second child, Prince Nillan with Tanzanian mega star Diamond Platnumz.One would think, this is a walk in the park for the self proclaimed mom-prenuer, who bounced back to her before-pregnancy bod, just like that. But it is not.Zari revealed that motherhood has it's challenges especially with Diamond away on tour, leaving her solo in the house taking care of Nillan and Princess Tiffah.She revealed that even with all the hired help she has, and the dotting and attentive grannies, Zari still has to stay up till her son falls asleep.She wrote, "With all the help in this house from the maids &amp;amp; grannies I still stay up with my son till he sleeps. It's hard work being a mom usually with less or no sleep at all but hey, it's the most beautiful thing ever. Some prolly think 'arrghh she sleeps and lets her nanny do the work, wrong I stay up all night every other day. What a job????!!! Just a Lil motivation for other moms. Ur not alone???? &amp;amp; you, rock coz late nights ain't for the weak????"Zari still wakes up and handles her business without fussing about the late nights.She wrote, "We all have the same 24hours it's what you do with them that determines everything.... #MomPrenuer."
