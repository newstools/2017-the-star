Double Paralympics gold medallist Samuel Muchai is hoping to set a new world record in T11 5000m at the World Para Athletic Championships set for July 14-23 in London this year.For the first time the World Para Athletics Championships and IAAF World Championships will be in the same city. Muchai won Kenya two gold medals in the men&rsquo;s T11 5000m and T11 1500m categories last September in Rio. &ldquo;Winning two gold medals in the same competition is not easy as this calls for serious physical and mental preparations,&rdquo; Muchai said. The Para athlete, who trains in Nandi and comes from Trans Nzoia County, already holds the world record in 1,500m, which set at the 2012 Paralympics Games in London when he clocked 3:58.07. He has a personal best time of 15:16.11 in T11 5000m, which he posted while winning gold at the Rio Games. The current world record of 15:11.07 was set at 2004 Athens Paralympics by another Kenyan Henry Wanyoike.&ldquo;I have the 1,500m T11 world record and I also want to target in the 5,000m.I believe it is doable because considering my previous performance. I was about six seconds shy of the target in Rio but I am determined to smash it this year. I have already started my training and I can only hope for the best,&rdquo; he added.Together with his guide James Boit, Muchai said they are working on speed and endurance in readiness for the championships.&ldquo;Our training has been good in the previous season and we want to take it to the next level this year. I want to polish areas that are very crucial and by July, I will be ready,&rdquo; Muchai said.
