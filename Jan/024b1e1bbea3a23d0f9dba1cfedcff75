Women in Kiambu are known for their zeal in the war against alcoholism, but a new study indicates they own most of the bars and drinking dens in the county.The study was done to understand why alcohol outlets in Thika town have not adhered to the &lsquo;Mututho law&rsquo; that banned sale of liquor beyond 11pm. However, a surprise finding is that women own many of the outlets now blamed for breakdown of families in the county and the rest of Central region. &ldquo;With lack of employment, many women engaged into the alcohol operations, which also contributed to the breakdown of their families given the mode of operations,&rdquo; the study, published in the latest issue of the East African Medical Journal, shows. Most of the operators said they are not aware of the Alcohol Control Act and its stringent regulations. Women in Kiambu have previously been reported to have beaten up their drunk husbands for neglecting their families. The situation is believed to have improved slightly after President Uhuru Kenyatta in July 2015, ordered a crackdown on illicit brews and cancellation of licences for second-generation alcohol. The Thika study enrolled 89 outlet operators and 70.8 per cent of them said they were not aware of the Alcohol Control Act. &ldquo;Association between marital status and non-adherence of the act was significant,&rdquo; P W Gitau, a scholar who led the study, says. The respondents included 10 informants, among them security personnel, health officers, managers and supervisors. The study, Factors Associated with Non-adherence to Regulations on Sale of Alcohol by Alcohol Outlets Operators in Thika municipality, Kiambu, was conducted late last year. It recommends the review of the &lsquo;Mututho law&rsquo; to make it more punitive. Last year, former National Authority for Campaign Against Alcohol and Drug Abuse chairman John Mututho said Kiambu residents spend Sh14 million daily on alcohol.
