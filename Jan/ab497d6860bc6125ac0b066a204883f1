The Justice and Legal Affairs Committee will begin vetting IEBC commissioner nominees today.The committee chaired by Ainabkoi MP Samuel Chepkonga will start by vetting chairperson nominee Wafula Chebukati at the mini-chambers at County Hall.The legal committee will then question Consolata Nkatah, Boya Molu and Roselyn Akombe, who have been nominated as commissioners for the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission.The committee will tomorrow wind up by questioning Paul Kurgat, Margaret Mwachanya and Abdi Guliye.The committee will then table its report before the National Assembly next Tuesday, when MPs are expected to hold a special sitting.The committee begins its work against the backdrop of a case filed by former Law Society of Kenya CEO Apollo Mboya who wants Parliament stopped from vetting the nominees.Mboya says the selection panel, chaired by Bernadette Musundi, contravened the Constitution when it chose the nominees because it failed to make public the criteria used to sift through the applications for the shortlist. The integrity of some nominees has been questioned , with claims against Chebukati and Nkatha. Chebukati was the lawyer of former anti-graft chief Philip Kinisu, whose firm Esaki Ltd received Sh35 million from the National Youth Service. Nkatha was accused of defrauding the National Museums of Kenya.
