President Uhuru Kenyatta did not win the March 4, 2013, election through rigging. He won it fairly, Nominated MP Johnson Sakaja has said.He dismissed claims by TNA former secretary general Onyango Oloo that the polls were rigged.At a press conference at his Nairobi home, Sakaja, the former TNA chairman, said Uhuru&rsquo;s victory is undisputed.&ldquo;We sold our campaign and a manifesto that Kenyans came to accept. We then went into the election where the President was the clear winner, a fact that was confirmed by the Supreme Court,&rdquo; he said.Oloo, who has moved to ODM, has been claiming that Uhuru&rsquo;s victory came through underhand tactics.The disgruntled former TNA official left Jubilee, claiming to have been sidelined following the dissolution of the party in September last year.Oloo was part of the merger negotiations with TNA, URP and 11 other parties that have now formed the Jubilee Party.Sakaja said Oloo&rsquo;s actions are those of a traitor. &ldquo;It means he cannot be trusted because the same things that he says he did are the same things he wants to do for ODM,&rdquo; he said.Sakaja said he is still in the contest for Nairobi governor and has not stepped aside for anyone as some reports suggest.He said that he is ready to compete with all JP aspirants in a free and fair election.
