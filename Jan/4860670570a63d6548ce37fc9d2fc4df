It is likely that the controversial Election Laws (Amendment) Bill will be referred to a mediation committee if Senate considers proposals by the public.A joint Senate committee has collected views on the amendments, which were passed by the National Assembly without public participation. The Senate will hold a special sitting today to consider the report to be tabled by the ICT and Legal Affairs committees. Two scenarios are expected: The Senate could disregard the views made by the public and proceed to vote on the Bill as passed by the National Assembly; or it could introduce amendments and refer the Bill back to the National Assembly.Should senators go for the first option, Jubilee will likely carry the day due to its numerical strength. It will, however, be a win for Cord, which has opposed the use of a manual backup, if the committee recommends mediation. Public and private agencies that appeared before the joint committee co-chaired by Busia Senator Amos Wako and Nyeri&rsquo;s Mutahi Kagwe said the electoral agency should use technology backup, instead of a manual system.The Council of Governors, Law Society of Kenya, Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights and the Media Owners&rsquo; Association said a manual backup is prone to manipulation.The committee, which finalised its report last evening, may choose to consider the views and propose amendments or trash them altogether.A Bill is referred to a mediation committee if the second House, in this case the Senate, rejects it. When the Bill is passed in an amended form, it shall be referred to the originating House (the National Assembly) for reconsideration.If the National Assembly passes the amended Bill, the speaker shall submit it to the President within seven days for assent. If the National Assembly rejects the amended version, the Bill shall be referred to a mediation committee appointed by the two House speakers. The committee will consist of equal number of members from each House.Read:Electronic voting system bound to fail, AG Githu Muigai tells Senate
