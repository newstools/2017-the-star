French Ambassador to Kenya Antoine Sivan has supported plans by the Technical University of Mombasa to start French classes to promote tourism.The deal was struck last Friday when he visited the institution and held talks with a TUM delegation led by acting VC Laila Abubakar. The Mombasa-based French Language and Cultural Centre, Alliance Francais, also committed itself to the launch.Abubakar said immense potential in the hospitality and tourism industry has compelled the university to cast its net wide through collaborations with the French Embassy. Sivan said France will ensure TUM establishes a French language centre so it can add value to tourism at the Coast.
