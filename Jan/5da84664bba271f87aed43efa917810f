Wiper Party leader Kalonzo Musyoka has for the second time criticised Machakos Senator Johnstone Muthama for demanding smaller parties in Ukambani fold up and join Wiper.During a Wiper caravan on Mombasa Road last year, Kalonzo told off Muthama after he made similar calls.Addressing mourners yesterday at the burial of former paramount chief Savano Maveke in Matungulu constituency, the Wiper leader described other political parties in Ukambani as &ldquo;part of the larger family&rdquo;.This elicited applause from the crowd.&ldquo;I want to correct Senator Muthama here on the issue of those other parties ... We all belong to the same family as they also have the right to exist,&rdquo; he said.In his address to the mourners, Muthama yesterday urged voters to reject leaders running for election on other parties and only vote for Wiper candidates.Muthama has been publicly campaigning for Machakos Deputy Governor Bernard Kiala to run for governor on the Wiper ticket.CCU leader Wavinya Ndeti also wants to run for governor, but has ruled out dissolving her party. The former Kathiani MP said it is wrong for any individual to impose leaders on the electorate.&ldquo;The voters must be granted the opportunity to elect who they want,&rdquo; Ndeti said.
