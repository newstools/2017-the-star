Rugby stakeholders have proposed that directors serve a four-year term instead of the current two years. The proposals are expected to be debated and finalised at the Annual General Meeting in March . A source privy to the information said the current two-year cycle is too short for work to be done hence the reason for the four-year proposal. &ldquo;Two years are tricky because the first year is used trying to lay a foundation and getting to know what the previous holder was doing. By the time you are in the second year, there is little progress and the election is fast approaching,&rdquo; added the source. The proposals will also be in line with the Sports Act which was passed 2013.The Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) constitution is also another issues to be addressed during the AGM. The proposal also affects the position of chairman, vice chairman, treasurer and secretary at the union. Chairman Richard Omwela is up for re-election in March and will face Sasha Mutai. Mutai led a &lsquo;coup&rsquo; two years ago with other affiliate but feels that is now water under the bridge as he has already started talking to the various affiliates on getting the top seat.Directors, Oscar Mango (national squads), Ian Mugambi (commercial) and Rajinder Sembi are up for re-election and have started wooing the various affiliates. Others who have expressed interest in the directors&rsquo; positions include Strathmore&rsquo;s Sylvia Kamau, Hillary Itela, Kabras chairman Roy Kabras and former vice chairman Phillip Jalango. The date of the AGM is yet to be set. Paula Lanco who has served four years in various director roles at the Kenya Rugby Union is not eligible for election as per the KRU constitution.
