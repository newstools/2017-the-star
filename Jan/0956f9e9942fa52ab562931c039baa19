Jubilee Party presidential campaign secretariat chairman Raphael Tuju has said he cannot risk seeking an elective seat on the ODM ticket since the party is &ldquo;unilaterally&rdquo; controlled by Raila Odinga&rsquo;s relatives.Tuju said the Odinga kinsmen will automatically win all elective positions in ODM strongholds. He pointed to the Kibra MP seat, which Cord leader Raila Odinga&rsquo;s daughter Rosemary has shown her interest in, saying it was predetermined in her favour.Other parliamentary seats that Tuju mentioned include Gem, where Jakoyo Midiwo, a Raila cousin, is defending for the fourth consecutive time, Bondo, where Raila&rsquo;s eldest brother Oburu Oginga is running for election and the Kisumu governor position, which Raila&rsquo;s younger sister Ruth is eyeing.&ldquo;All those seats have their designates,&rdquo; Tuju said.Stumbling blockHe was speaking on Saturday in Kandaria village, Rarieda constituency, during the burial of former councillor John Okello.The former Rarieda MP had been urged by local residents to decamp to ODM and run for Siaya governor on August 8. But Tuju said he cannot fit in the kind of politics played in the Nyanza region, which is controlled by the Odinga factor.Ugenya politician Steve Mwanga echoed Tuju&rsquo;s sentiments, saying Luo Nyanza politics is influenced by the Odinga family. The Lake Basin Development Authority director, who is also a Jubilee Party secretariat campaign team member, said he fell victim to the Odinga factor in the 2013 election.Mwanga said he was denied victory in the Ugenya MP race, even though he won with a landslide, since he was not in the Odinga family&rsquo;s good books or related to them.The debate was sparked by former Ombudsman Otiende Amollo, who praised Tuju for his development track record when he was the Rarieda MP for one term.&ldquo;We reckon your tenure as an MP where locals for the first time saw a tarmac road, including putting this region on the Kenyan map,&rdquo; Amollo said. He said they want to associate with Tuju, but JP is a stumbling block.Amollo, who is eyeing the Rarieda parliamentary seat, endorsed the incumbent Nicholas Gumbo&rsquo;s Siaya governor.The burial was attended by Gumbo and Siaya woman representative aspirant Florence Aluodo, among others.
