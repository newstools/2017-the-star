Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria has called a one-day public engagement forum on his proposed Kenya Stand Your Ground Bill. The bill seeks to allow citizens to defend themselves in case of political violence.The forum will take place at the Safaricom Stadium Kasarani gymnasium on Wednesday from 10am.In a statement, Kuria said the bill will supplement existing national measures that entitle every person to freedom and security.He said the proposed legislation, popular in the US, aims to protect life and property.&ldquo;The principle of giving civilians a legal framework within which they can engage and combat crime first, deters crime and reduces unnecessary loss of life and wanton destruction of property,&rdquo; Kuria said.
