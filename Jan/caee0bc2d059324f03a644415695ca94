Tests on best-selling crisps, biscuits and baby food showed raised levels of a chemical linked to cancer.The health alert comes just 24 hours after an official watchdog warned of the risks of eating burnt toast and roast potatoes. The latest products on the danger list include Kettle Chips, Burts crisps, Hovis, Fox&rsquo;s biscuits, Kenco coffee, McVitie&rsquo;s and products from Cow &amp; Gate.According to the Food Standards Agency, 25 products have raised levels of acrylamide. Animal studies suggest the chemical can trigger DNA mutations and cancer.The link to acrylamide was also behind the warning over fried, roasted and toasted foods such as potatoes and bread.The agency cautioned that any risk to humans related to lifetime consumption and not occasional eating. However a renowned statistician yesterday insisted the link to cancer in humans from acrylamide was extremely weak."There is no good evidence of harm from humans consuming acrylamide in their diet," said Professor David Spiegelhalter.The FSA and other watchdogs in Europe test supermarket food to assess whether acrylamide levels are above a suggested limit &ndash; IV, for indicative value.Of 526 products in targeted tests in 2014 and 2015, 25 had raised levels. Although the agency is not advising consumers to stop eating the products, the manufacturers have been told to cut the levels.The FSA said: "For all of these samples we followed up with the manufacturers or brand owners via local authority inspectors. "They alerted them to the findings and requested information about what is being done to control acrylamide in those products. "We would emphasise though that the indicative values are not legal maximum limits nor are they safety levels. "They are performance indicators and designed to promote best practice in controlling acrylamide levels."Helen Munday of the Food and Drink Federation, which speaks for the manufacturers, said: "Food companies have been lowering acrylamide in UK-made products for years."The FSA report provides a useful snapshot of acrylamide levels in a wide range of foods. "At the time of surveying these products, up to three years ago in some cases, any individual foods found to contain levels of acrylamide above indicative values would have prompted a review by both FSA and the brand owner.&lsquo;UK food manufacturers have been working with supply chain partners, regulators and other bodies, at home and abroad, to lower acrylamide levels for years."To continue to make progress, the food and drink industry, in partnership with the European Commission, has developed detailed codes of practice."Cow &amp; Gate said: "We take food safety extremely seriously and have been working hard to reduce acrylamide levels. 'In fact, in 2015 we took the decision to discontinue Sunny Start Baby Wheat Flakes as we were unable to reduce the level sufficiently.&rsquo;The statement said a spaghetti bolognese failure was expected to be a "one-off result".Read full story on Daily Mail
