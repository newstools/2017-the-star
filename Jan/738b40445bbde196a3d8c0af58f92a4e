The 2017 Kenya Volleyball Federation national league serves off on February 10 in Kericho County.The development comes after the KVF national executive committee meeting over the weekend at the Nyayo Stadium to discuss among other things the 2017 calender.KVF secretary general, Ben Juma, said they have a busy schedule this year, the reason why the national league will start off early. &ldquo;NEC had a successful meeting as we laid the foundation for the 2017 calender and just as we had a good year in 2016, we can only hope for the best again this time around. The clubs&rsquo; team managers are scheduled to hold their meeting on January 28th at the Nyayo Stadium to discuss among other things the draws and fixtures of the first leg of the league,&rdquo; noted Juma. Kenya Pipeline (women) and Kenya Prisons (men) are the league defending champions.Kenya Pipeline reigned supreme against local nemesis Kenya Prisons while Kenya Prisons were too good for their arch rivals General Service Unit during the last year&rsquo;s play-offs at the Makande Hall, Mombasa.The official also took note of the forthcoming national team and clubs activities, saying they will have to go out of their way as far as the budget is concerned.&ldquo;For instance, we have the two national teams&mdash; national women&rsquo;s senior and under 23 women&rsquo;s teams which have major assignments. The senior team will feature in the World Grand Prix Group 2 event and the Africa Cup of Nations while under 23 side will participate in the World Championship set for Ljubljana and Maribo in Slovenia,&rdquo; observed Juma.He continued, &ldquo; We therefore have an outrageous budget and we are reaching out to the government, sponsors and people of good will to come forth and support us.&rdquo;The club championship are set for March (men) and April (women) in Tunisia.
