The IEBC was yesterday given early notice to extend the mass voter registration for pastoral communities by one month after the February 14 deadline, or be sued. Fafi MP Barre Shill said there is a low voter turnout among pastoralists because many people have migrated to look for food and pasture due to drought. &ldquo;Why is voter registration done when there is drought and hunger? We are starving and thirsty. We need food, water and medicine to be distributed to Marsabit, Turkana, Mandera, Garissa, Wajir, Baringo counties. We cannot register and vote when we are dead,&rdquo; Shill told the media at Parliament Buildings. Shill, also the National Assembly Defence and Foreign Relations committee vice chairman, told Devolution CS Mwangi Kiunjuri and his Water counterpart Eugene Wamalwa to distribute water and food to the hungry, rather than &ldquo;deceiving the President&rdquo; that no life is going to be lost from starvation.
