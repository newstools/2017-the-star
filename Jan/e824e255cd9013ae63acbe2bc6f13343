Nairobi governor hopeful Peter Kenneth and his running mate Philip Kisia have attracted hundreds of youths to their camp.The youth, some of whom campaigned for Governor Evans Kidero in the run-up to the March 4, 2013 general election, have shifted allegiance and joined the former Gatanga MP&rsquo;s camp.Led by outspoken city youth leader Samuel Esendi, alias Sammy Boy, the hundreds of youths are preparing to take up roles in steering Kenneth&rsquo;s campaigns. The youths spoke on Saturday in a Nairobi hotel. &ldquo;As you know, many of us have quit ODM and withdrawn our support for Kidero to support Kenneth. We believe the two will take care of our interests,&rdquo; Esendi said.However,other youths are trying to draw attention from other governor aspirants. A faction led by Jonah Onyango in Eastlands and University student leader Babu Owino have been absorbed into Kidero&rsquo;s camp. Other youths led by Samuel Mundia are supporting Bishop Margaret Wanjiru.But Senator Mike Sonko is said to control the biggest support. &ldquo;You will see how Sonko will trounce his opponents,&rdquo; a youth said.
