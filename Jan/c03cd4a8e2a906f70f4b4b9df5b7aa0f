Tax revenues for six months through December rose 11.94 per cent to Sh591.17 billion compared to Sh528.11 billion in a similar period in 2015, fresh data released by the National Treasury shows. The cash collected by the Kenya Revenue Authority represent 44.44 per cent of the full-year target of Sh1.33 trillion, Treasury CS Henry Rotich says in the Statement of Actual Revenues and Net Exchequer Issues. The KRA is banking on continued recruitment of new taxpayers through online tax filing platform, iTax, and increased taxes after the Excise Duty Act 2015 came to force last December to meet the ambitious target. The taxman also started linking the iTax to third-party databases in December, with the first phase targeting companies getting state tenders under the Integrated Financial Management Information System. &ldquo;There will be some taxes that we can recover directly even before the money is paid to somebody because of that linkage like withholding VAT and withholding income tax,&rdquo; KRA commissioner general John Njiraini said during an earlier interview on the iTax-IFMIS linkage. Tax revenues made up about 72.28 per cent of the Sh817.89 billion total earnings by the government during the six-month period, the data shows. This was a flat growth year-on-year as the revenues in the first half of 2016-17 financial year rose by a marginal 0.03 per cent or Sh230 million compared with Sh817.66 billion in the same period of the previous year. Non-tax revenues almost doubled in the six months through December 2016, jumping 85.36 per cent to Sh31.29 billion in December 2016 compared to Sh16.88 billion in December 2015. Net borrowing from domestic market fell by 13.66 per cent or Sh24.78 billion to stand at Sh156.63 billion, while loans from foreign governments and international organisations rose by 14.16 per cent to Sh12.74 billion. Fitch Ratings on December 23 affirmed a B+ rating on Kenya&rsquo;s long-term borrowing, saying budget deficit for 2016-17 was likely to drop to 7.1 per cent of the GDP from 7.5 per cent last year. &ldquo;The possibility of under-performing tax revenues and increased current expenditures around the August 2017 general elections represent a downside risk, although this is balanced against Kenya&rsquo;s history of under-executing capital expenditures,&rdquo; Fitch said. General grants climbed to Sh4.04 billion from Sh2.80 billion, the Treasury data shows. The country's earnings from African Union Mission to Somalia, where Kenyan Defence Forces are helping keep peace, were Sh1.45 billion compared to the Sh2.31 billion in the first half of the financial year 2015-16. Loans from commercial lenders also declined six-fold to Sh10.11 billion from Sh74.33 billion. This is because the Treasury was forced to borrow $750 million from Standard Chartered, Stanbic and Citi Bank to ease cash crunch in October 2015 after it delayed domestic borrowing plan because of high interest rates.
