The four Kenyan representatives at the 2017 Africa Club Championships have been given until next month to confirm their participation or give up slots for other teams.The country has entered Kenya Volleyball Federation (KVF) league winners Kenya Pipeline (women) and Kenya Prisons (men), and, runners up Kenya Prisons (women) and General Service Unit. According to KVF, the four are required to confirm their participation by end of February for the tournament to be staged in Tunisia cities of Tunis in March (men), and women&rsquo;s in Kelibia in April.In the case any of the above clubs withdraw from the tournament in good time, third-placed Kenya Ports Authority (men) and 2006 Africa holders Kenya Commercial Bank (women) should be ready to fill in their slots.&ldquo;So many countries have expressed interest in participating in this year&rsquo;s edition hence registration will be on a first come-first serve basis. It is vital that Kenya enlists more than one team in each gender so that our players gain experience at the international stage,&rdquo; said KVF secretary general, Ben Juma. &ldquo;Communication should be made in good time to enable another team to confirm and have an ample time to prepare for the competitions,&rdquo; he added. Last year, Kenya Prisons sides failed to confirm their participation in the show until the last minute.Kenya have won a total of 13 titles in the women&rsquo;s category, with Kenya Pipeline grabbing seven trophies, Kenya Prisons five and KCB one. No Kenyan men&rsquo;s team has ever won the title at the continental stage. Kenya Prisons men&rsquo;s squad came closer to winning the 2011 title but fell to Egypt&rsquo;s Al Ahly SC 3-0 in the final. Last year, GSU finished a distant 17th in the Games held in Cairo, Egypt.
