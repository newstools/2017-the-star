Budalang'i MP Ababu Namwamba has accused the Busia government of failing to allocate funds to renovate Ruambwa-Namabusi-MauMau road, which is in a pathetic state.He defended himself against claims by his rivals that he has done nothing during his tenure. Namwamba addressed his constituents in Siagonjo Stadium, Bunyala South, during the closing of the Isambo Festival on Sunday.&ldquo;I have done a lot. My development record speaks for itself. Those claiming I have done nothing are envious and only want to finish me politically, but they will fail miserably,&rdquo; he said. He said he is liaising with the national government to get funds to renovate the road.
