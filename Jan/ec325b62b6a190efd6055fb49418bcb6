International Evelyn Makuto has recovered from the knee injury ahead of the forthcoming Kenya Volleyball Federation national league play-offs set for November 25-27 at the Makande Hall in Mombasa.Makuto, who picked the injury in September during one of the Kenya Prisons teams training sessions at the Nairobi West ground, has missed the last two KVF legs in Voi and Eldma Ravine respectively. The regular Kenya Prisons and national team left attacker acknowledged her recovery wouldn&rsquo;t have come at a right time. She said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s sad I have missed the last two KVF legs which set the stage for this month&rsquo;s play-off. But I am happy my team-mates staged a good performance and finished the regular league top of the standing. They were also unbeaten and that is something to be proud of,&rdquo;She added: &ldquo;We are currently training at the Safaricom indoor Arena, Kasarani and the training is going well.&rdquo;Asked about the forthcoming play-offs, Makuto, who is a sibling to former most sought after national team player Asha Makuto, Kenya Pipeline middle blocker Violet Makuto and General Service Unit men player Luke Makuto, said they hope to reclaim the trophy, which they last won in 2013. Makuto, however, said it will not be easy since their opponents and champions Kenya Pipeline, Nairobi Water and Kenya Commercial Bank are also eying the trophy.&ldquo;I have not featured for Kenya Prisons in the past two play-off seasons and I am eager and ready to work alongside my team-mates to see to it that we reclaim the trophy. I am aware it&rsquo;s not going to be a walk in the park because our opponents are equally good, but we are willing to go an extra mile to see to it that we reclaim the trophy,&rdquo; said Makuto, who was named the Most Valuable Player at the 17th edition of the African Nations Cup Championship in 2015 in Nairobi. Makuto, alongside team-mates setter Jane Wacu, former national team captain Brackcidise Agala and captain Mercy Moim were away on attachment in Europe.Wacu and Agala were attached to club Charmeliers in France while Moim was with club Orpo in Finland.
