A friend recently shared laughing how she has been pursuing a certain project for a very long time with no success such that her now older children no longer pray for her to succeed with the project as they used to do when younger; they&rsquo;ve just given up but not her.The same can be said about our beloved country; there are those of us who have been wishing and praying for a very long time that our country awakens to a new reality where peace and prosperity is in abundance and rampant corruption and tribalism is a thing of the past.However, many others have given up and stopped praying about this altogether, resigning to the contrary belief that tribalism, and corruption are here to say while democratic ideals are out of reach as politicians exploit the aforementioned vices to gain office only to loot some more and leave the country even more impoverished.It&rsquo;s a shame but those deeply steeped in these vices who should have some and leave their wicked ways have none.There&rsquo;s hope, however, and for those of us who believe in the power of prayer, this is a New Year, which brings with it new hope if only we can double our efforts not just in prayer but also in each of us doing our part in making it possible for our beloved country to become a better country.For those of you who don&rsquo;t believe in prayer&mdash;or God for that matter, you, too, must draw from whatever source you derive the energy to do the possible and at times the impossible to reach the same level of commitment to make our beloved country a better country.For those in leadership positions and especially positions of power, this means in the same spirit pausing for a moment and asking yourself what in that position you hold have you done to make this Kenya a better country; are you holding office to line your pockets with loot while your fellow Kenyans, especially children go to bed hungry many a countless nights?A notorious conservative loudmouth in the United States by the name Rush Limbaugh often rallies the right wingers in the country saying Democrats rejoice in having blacks and minorities in economic doldrums because it&rsquo;s the only way they can vote them into office or keep them there.It&rsquo;s a vile charge which has no basis other than in the imagination of the loudmouth.However, does the same hold true in our beloved country, namely, is it the case it&rsquo;s in the interest of politicians to keep Kenyans in the state of poverty just so they can hold them captive in voting for them come election time?The evidence on hand points in that direction; leaving Mzee Jomo Kenyatta out of this for the simple reason he&rsquo;s no longer with us, retired president Daniel Arap Moi and his regime perfected the art of buying votes with as little as 100 bob and even bragged about it made possible only because of an impoverished nation.Kibaki era brought us wholesale buying of politicians themselves made worse in the current Jubilee government such that today you have shameless politicians from the West and Coast ditching the opposition to join Jubilee for the sake of &ldquo;development.&rdquo; Americans will say development my ass, meaning total nonsense.Yet, these shameless politicians without any scruples can and do siphon away enough votes in opposition strongholds which coupled with the 100 bob votes bought from the poor can and do make a difference in the outcome of elections.It&rsquo;s a big problem which those in the opposition that care about our country must come together and devise a sound strategy to defeat besides deploying other strategies in making sure they take over the reigns of power and take us in a new direction for Jubille had its chance but has failed.It&rsquo;s a wish and prayer one hopes a vast majority of the country will concur and act on it come Election Day.The writer is a legal expert and political commentator in the United States
