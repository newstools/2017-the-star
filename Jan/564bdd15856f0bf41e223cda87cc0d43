Three Kilifi county leaders have formed a third force to challenge ODM and Jubilee in the race for governor.They are Deputy Governor Kennedy Kamto, who fell out with Governor Amason Kingi, professor Gabriel Katana and former Labour CS Kazungu Kambi.The three said they will soon launch their partnership whose primary objective is to end the people's "suffering" under Kingi's leadership.Kamto, Katana and Kambi said they will use Coast-based political party Kadu Asili to sell their manifesto and take over after the August 8 general election.Read: Kadu Asili will not join Ababu&rsquo;s &lsquo;mirage&rsquo; third force, says Mwinga[PHOTOS] Jubilee supporters endorse Mung'aro as Coast kingpin, Kilifi governorOne of the three will be chosen by Mijikenda elders as the flag bearer to vie against Kingi and Kilifi North MP Gideon Mung'aro (Jubilee).The elders have been holding a series of meetings with all the nine sub-tribes to come up with a common goal.The leaders said their mission is to take over the county's leadership and fulfill the promises of devolution, before choosing the coalition to support - whether President Uhuru Kenyatta's Jubilee Party or the opposition's National Super Alliance.Kamto and Lucas Maitha, former Malindi MP and Kebs chairman, on Sunday met elders who are part of the Malindi District Cultural Association (MADCA), Dhome and the Muslims council to discuss their political agenda.The Deputy Governor told them to attend another meeting with the Jibana later in January, to discuss the governance and political strategy ahead of the election.&ldquo;The biggest problems in Kilifi county are leadership and how to use resources. Time has come to say the truth," he said.He said he has been frustrated under Kingi's administration and that junior staff members have engaged in corruption to amass wealth for themselves.Some, he said, call themselves billionaires, yet they had nothing when devolution was implemented.Read: Probe rampant corruption in Kilifi, Mung'aro tells EACCAlso read: EACC summons Kingi amid probe into Sh308 million Kilifi bus park dealKamto has met with the Ribe, Rabai, Chonyi, Kauma, and Kambe, and is left with the Jibana, Duruma, Giriama and Digo.Maitha said the joint force will consolidate bloc votes while challenging ODM and Jubilee to show what they have done for the people.&ldquo;The third force comprises politicians and majority of Kilifi residents who are tired of ODM and Jubilee leadership," he said.He noted one of the three who have united has to become flag bearer as independent races would be a reflection of lack of seriousness in defeating the opposition.But Maitha said the three are currently at liberty to campaign individually and gather votes.
