Old men in Tetu, Nyeri county, have shied away from registering as voters because they fear the BVR machines might expose their past crimes.Most of them were involved in the struggle for Independence.The elderly are afraid the machines may lead to their arrest and prosecution for crimes committed more than 60 years ago.&ldquo;The men are quite convinced that placing their fingers on the BVR machines will expose them. Most of them are Mau Mau veterans who were aggressively involved in the struggle for Independence,&rdquo; Tetu MP hopeful Peter Kamuthu said.&ldquo;That is the reason we need the IEBC to conduct intensive user-friendly civic education, which should be doorto- door education.&rdquo;The final mass voter registration before the elections started yesterday, and will end on February 14. The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission is targeting four to 6.7 million new voters.He said veterans in Ihururu and Muhoyas do not want to register as voters or vote unless they are assured by authorities that they will not be arrested.Kamuthu said he found out about their fears while campaigning in the two areas recently.
