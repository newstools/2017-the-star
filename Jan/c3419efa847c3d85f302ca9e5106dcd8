The Jubilee Party will hold free and fair primaries and no candidate will be given a free ticket, Deputy President William Ruto said yesterday.&ldquo;Jubilee believes in fairness. We want everyone to get justice and this is why I am assuring you that we will do our best to ensure our nominations are free, fair and credible,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;In fact fair, nominations are not a favour to anyone but a right.&rdquo;There were fears that JP is likely to endorse select candidates.But Ruto said, &ldquo;Aspirants should now concentrate on convincing voters to elect them and do away with the perception we will favour anyone.&rdquo;Governor aspirants said they will back whoever wins the nominations to wrest the post from the incumbent Isaac Rutto.Ruto hosted a delegation of leaders from Bomet county, including Energy CS Charles Keter, National Assembly Deputy Speaker Joyce Laboso (Sotik MP), Deputy Governor Stephen Mutai, Senator Wilfred Lesan and woman representative Cecilia Ngetich.Others were MPs Sammy Koech (Konoin), Paul Bii (Chepalungu), Benard Bett (Bomet East) and Ronald Tonui (Bomet Central).
