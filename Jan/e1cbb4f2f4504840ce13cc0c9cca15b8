Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago has denied claims the county lost more than Sh4.5 billion in the 2014-15 financial year.Last month, the Office of the Auditor General published reports showing Uasin Gishu was among counties that could not account for millions of shillings allocated to them in that year.But the county chief said on Wednesday the allegations are false, political and meant to undermine him and his administration.&ldquo;If money was misused, we wouldn&rsquo;t be running smoothly as we do,&rdquo; Mandago said.He said he appeared before the Senate and answered all the audit queries, hence, the auditor&rsquo;s report are not factual.Speaking in Kuinet, Mandago said all county funds were used prudently and the county has not lost any cash since its inception.&ldquo;My administration can account for every cent we have received and spent. I appeared before the Senate Public Accounts Committee willingly and answered all the audit queries,&rdquo; he said. Auditor General Edward Ouko questioned the county&rsquo;s expenditures and other financial operations amounting to more than Sh1 billion. The matter has also been raised by Senator Isaac Melly, who has been pushing for a lifestyle audit of Mandago and his top officers.Melly said the county&rsquo;s top officials misused more than Sh2.5 billion. But Mandago, who will be seeking reelection on the JP ticket in the August 8 polls, hit back at the senator, saying he does not understand how devolution works.&ldquo;Some of them have been away from the county for the last four years. There is no way they can understand what was happening when they were away,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Let them go round and see for themselves the benefits of devolution before they talk.&rdquo;
