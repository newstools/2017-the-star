&ldquo;When he came to school on his first day in 2013, Manaseh Akwenda was wearing his father&rsquo;s old trouser, held by a sisal rope in the waist. He didn&rsquo;t have shoes but was determined to get admitted in school,&rdquo; recalled Musungu Anusu, the principal of St Beda&rsquo;s Bukaya SecondarySchool in Mumias.He was referring to Manaseh Akwendah, 18, who scored the only &lsquo;A&rsquo; (81 points) in Kakamega county in the recently released KCSE examinations.Akwenda wants to become a neurosurgeon and assist the many patients suffering from problems associated with the brain. He promises to work hard to improve the living standards of his family.HUMBLE BACKGROUND&ldquo;I am the third born in a family of seven. Our firstborn brother is still hustling since he completed university a year ago. Second-born twins are girls, and we cannot rely on them because they will get married and concentrate on their families. So it remains upon me to increase my efforts to change the image of our family,&rdquo; Akwenda said.He attributed his achievement to hard work, commitment, sacrifice and prayers: &ldquo;I would wake up very early in the morning for studies. I would go to school during weekends and holidays, when other candidates were away, and do thorough revisions on my own.&rdquo;He praised his teachers, who worked closely and guided him towards his best performance. &ldquo;My parents accorded me every opportunity to study. That is how I managed to visit the school and study during holidays when I was supposed to help them with household chores&rdquo; Bukaya is a rural school in South Wanga Division, Mumias West.&ldquo;We are on record as a small rural school beating giants in performance. Last year&rsquo;s &lsquo;A&rsquo; did not come as a surprise because we knew the kind of a boy Akwenda was. He emerged the top candidate in Catholic-sponsored joint exams in the county, was the best in South Wanga joint exams and has been leading in other tests and exhibiting success in symposiums,&rdquo; Anusu said.He said the school has clustered learners into familes of six, and this has helped in monitoring discipline and performance. &ldquo;Akwenda belonged to the principal&rsquo;s family and got close attention from the principal. Students had vowed to fill the first column in the national slots and indeed, Akwenda has put them where they desired,&rdquo; he said.The principal said the school registered 111 candidates in 2016 and recorded a mean score of 4.973, despite producing the single A plain among the 141 As recorded.MATIANG&rsquo;I REFORMS PRAISED The school Board of Management chairman, David Mulongo, applauded Education CS Fred Matiang&rsquo;i for implementing stringent measures in the education sector.&ldquo;2016 KCPE and KCSE results reflected the real students&rsquo; efforts, as compared to the previous years, where students were drilled for examinations. What we need is urgent attention to teacher quality, school resources, school governance and how to unleash the creative genius in a child,&rdquo; Mulongo said.&ldquo;I have been wondering how the modern learners had become very clever over time. But last year&rsquo;s results have indicated there was a lot of cheating and the value of examination has been shown in improvement and candidates achieving &lsquo;their own grades&rsquo;.&rdquo;No student managed A- or B+ from Bukaya. Two candidates scored B plain and 11 C+.Most big schools from the county, including Kakamega High, Butere Girls, St Peter&rsquo;s Mumias, Musingu and St Mary&rsquo;s Mumias, did not manage to record a plain &lsquo;A&rsquo;.St Peter&rsquo;s will send 144 students to university after recording 21 A-, 34 B+, 43 B plain and 46 C+. 56 scored C plain, 24 C- and 10 D+.Kakamega High school has 177 candidates who managed to get a direct entry into the public university.
