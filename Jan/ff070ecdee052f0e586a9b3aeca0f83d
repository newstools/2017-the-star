President Uhuru Kenyatta on Wednesday denied Governor Martin Wambora and his rivals a chance to address his meetings, apparently to refrain booing among their supporters.The President traversed the county appealing to residents to register as voters. He blocked Wambora, Senator Lenny Kivuti and Runyenjes legislator Cecily Mbarire, all seeking the governor seat.The President was reported to have done that to avoid heckling and booing among supporters of the challengers. Uhuru urged Embu county leaders involved in squabbles for more than three years not to resort to violence, but instead, strive to unify the people. Reports came out the previous day that some of the aspirants had planned to mobilise youth to heckle their rivals. On Tuesday, Public Service CS Sicily Kariuki, county commissioner Esther Maina and Mbarire said they had information that some leaders were mobilising youth to prevent them from speaking at Uhuru&rsquo;s rallies.During a meeting presided over by the CS at the Tana and Athi Water offices, the leaders warned the suspects of dire consequences and appealed for calm at Uhuru&rsquo;s rallies.
