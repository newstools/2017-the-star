Coast regional coordinator Nelson Marwa has been ordered to stop saying Aharub Khatri is a suspected drug baron or that he illegally owns guns, after Khatri claimed he was being sacrificed to settle political scores.On January 13, Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho and other leaders spent more than seven hours demanding Khatri&rsquo;s release from the Coast region CID headquarters in Mombasa.Joho and the leaders later said they had been arrested and detained, but Marwa denied the claims and said the governor remained at the station to cause chaos. He said Joho and the other leaders were trying to incite supporters against the government and police.&ldquo;Joho came to the station demanding the release of Khatri. He harassed and abused officers who we commend for exercising restraint,&rdquo; Marwa said.He accused Joho of trying to shield a suspect wanted by Interpol over an international drug racket.Yesterday, High Court judge Thande Mugure directed Marwa to temporarily stop issuing any statements concerning Khatri with regard to his arrest, whether directly or indirectly.Khatri accused Marwa of slandering him to settle scores with Joho.He reported that on January 14, Marwa called a press conference naming him as a suspected drug baron who is being protected by the governor.&ldquo;In my heart, I felt I was being used as the defendants&rsquo; sacrificial lamb in a political contest I was not involved in,&rdquo; Khatri said in his affidavit.Marwa was accused of endangering Khatri&rsquo;s life having said that he owns several armouries in his house.In his application filed on January 19, Khatri told the court that the matter was of public interest as Marwa had tried to justify his arrest through false and deceitful depiction of the circumstances of his arrest.&ldquo;Since the publication of the offending words, the harm is still ongoing with a lot of negative publications and social media exposure relying on his false information,&rdquo; Khatri said.He said he is a licensed firearm holder and Marwa is aware of this.Khatri said he fears for his life as the public has classified him as a dangerous criminal, following Marwa&rsquo;s defamatory attacks.He accused Marwa of taking advantage of his position to cause chaos and he fears that investigations will not be fair because of the negative and misleading information Marwa gave.Khatri wants Marwa to apologise in the media and stop making defamatory statements about him and interfering with the legal mandate of the National Police Service.
