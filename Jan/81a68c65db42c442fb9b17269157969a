East African Legislative Assembly member Shyrose Bhanji has been allowed to table a Bill seeking to protect people with albinism. If passed, the EALC Protection of People with Albinism Bill, 2016, will put in place sanctions, including convictions of those who discriminate against albinos. It also seeks to promote the dignity and equal opportunities of persons with albinism. &ldquo;There are people with albinism who are killed in the face of negative beliefs and witchcraft. We live in a modern society and such beliefs have no place in the world today. Such killings should be stopped and are criminal,&rdquo; Bhanji said. &ldquo;We must also put in place and propagate affirmative action for those with albinism.&rdquo; MPs who supported Bhanji&rsquo;s Bill in an assembly sitting in Kampala, Uganda, are Mike Sebalu, Maryam Yahya, James Ndahiro, Patricia Hajabakiga and Abubakar Ogle. Others are Abubakar Zein, Valerie Nyirahabineza and Taslima Twaha.
