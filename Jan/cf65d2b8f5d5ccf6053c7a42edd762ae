Nairobi governor hopeful Peter Kenneth&rsquo;s campaign has failed to take off due to a split between the President and Deputy President&rsquo;s handlers.A source close to the presidency, who requested anonymity, said President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s handlers are worried that Kenneth&rsquo;s candidature will hamper his reelection.&ldquo;Ruto&rsquo;s men see Kenneth as an impediment to his 2022 quest for president. He has brought a wedge between President Uhuru and DP Ruto,&rdquo; the source said. The source said Ruto&rsquo;s men are determined to block Kenneth. &ldquo;There is a feeling among Ruto&rsquo;s camp that if he becomes the governor, he will inherit the Mt Kenya vote bloc and lock out Ruto. Even the President is afraid of him and is not going with him on his tours of the country urging residents to register and vote,&rdquo; the source said.However, city youths allied to Kenneth want him to launch his campaign and stop listening to &ldquo;sceptical&rdquo; people.&ldquo;We know people like Senator Mike Sonko don&rsquo;t want Kenneth because he is a real threat. The so-called Team Nairobi is afraid of him because he will defeat them,&rdquo; Sammy Aluda, an ardent Kenneth supporter, said. He dismissed claims that Kenneth&rsquo;s campaign has failed to kick off. &ldquo;How have the campaigns failed to kick off yet the official campaigns haven&rsquo;t started?&rdquo; Aluda asked.Sonko last week said Kenneth is a latecomer, who should not purport to be in JP yet he has not dissolved his KNC party.
