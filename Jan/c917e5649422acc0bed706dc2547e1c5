Private hospitals have recorded a rise in the number of patients. A spot check by the Star in Nairobi&rsquo;s Mater, MP Shah and Aga Khan hospitals showed many patients at the waiting bay. They were on the doctor&rsquo;s waiting list. A medic who did not want to be named said they are overstretched because of the doctors&rsquo; strike in public hospitals. &ldquo;Our working hours remain the same, but I&rsquo;m worried about patients. My greatest fear is that I&rsquo;m not giving the patient the time he or she requires as I need to attend to other patients too,&rdquo; he said.The medic is a consultant in two private hospitals. The Star also learnt that consultation fees in private hospitals have not been increased since doctors in public hospitals downed their tools on December 5 last year. The situation was similar in Aga Khan hospital, Kisumu county. Medical director Sam Oula said many patients are referred to them by public hospitals.
