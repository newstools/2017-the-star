Is Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula preparing to take on Bungoma Governor Ken Lusaka? Some people known to be close to the Bungoma senator whisper to Corridors that Weta, as he popularly known, is seriously thinking about running for governor, following Musalia Mudavadi&rsquo;s reentry into the opposition. We are told Weta thinks if he can&rsquo;t get his way in Cord then the fallback position will be Bungoma, where he has sustained an assault on the Jubilee-allied Lusaka. ***********Call it an appearance - or broker&rsquo;s - fee. Several MPs who showed up for Deputy President William Ruto&rsquo;s massive New Year celebrations at his Sugoi home had every reason to smile as they walked home, not so baldly off, but with &lsquo;something for the stomach&rsquo; for another day as well. Corridors has learnt that the DP opened his deep financial vaults during the lavish party at his luxury home, giving each MP who attended the feast Sh100,000. The event was attended by more than 100 MPs and more than 10 governors, including a number of them from Central Kenya. Those who attended said the DP&rsquo;s ceremony was not only well attended by locals and visitors from as far afield as Garissa and Malindi, but also the Who is Who in the political and business circles. It was a golden opportunity for politicians to catch a glimpse of the DP&rsquo;s palatial home as he eyes State House in 2022. **********A Jubilee honcho from Nakuru county has formed a cartel of aspirants and a faction of disgruntled party members who are now terrorising hopefuls ahead of the party primaries. The former lawmaker, who has been bragging about unfettered access to the highest offices in this country, including State House, has become a menace to the Jubilee Party and if not checked he may brew more trouble going forward. He has been collecting thousands of shillings from aspirants seeking the Jubilee ticket in the guise that the money would facilitate meetings with top party officials from the Jubilee secretariat. A few weeks ago, he assembled more than 100 aspirants for various positions, among them MCAs. Each attendee paid a total of Sh20,000 ostensibly to meet the so-called officials from Nairobi. *********The cash transfers to the elderly are turning out to be a big scandal and a cash cow through which administrative chiefs and their assistants are making quick money through ghost beneficiaries. The scheme is said to be poorly managed, with massive loopholes that have facilitated looting of public funds.
