East African Breweries plans to invest heavily in marketing its flagship Tusker Lager among younger consumers in a bid to reverse flagging sales, the giant brewer said on Friday.Kenya Breweries managing director Jane Karuku said the youths largely see the beer, launched in 1922, as a brand for the older generation. &ldquo;The millennials or new people coming into legal drinking age feel like it belongs to their fathers, their uncles. They don&rsquo;t feel like it is contemporary,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;So what we are trying to do as a business is make it more contemporary and attractive, either in communications and labelling. We are very hopeful that we are going to see the turnaround of this brand because we all care for it.&rdquo;EABL&rsquo;s net profit from continuing business for six months through December 31 grew by a marginal 1.84 per cent to Sh5.59 billion compared with Sh5.48 billion in the same period a year ago, its unaudited financial statement showed. The net earnings were largely hurt by a 16 per cent decline in the mainstream beer sales because of excise duty introduced in December 2015.However, the Sh5.59 billion profit is a 27.78 per cent drop compared to Sh7.73 billion a year earlier when discontinued businesses are factored in. The company, controlled 50.03 per cent by Diageo of UK, made a one-off profit of Sh2.2 billion from the sale of Central Glass Industries to a South African firm, and Sh707 million after selling its idle land a year before.Sales revenues fell 6.29 per cent in the half-year period to Sh35.16 billion from Sh37.51 billion previously, after a 16 per cent growth in spirits and Senator Keg brands failed to offset the drop in beer sales. Kenya, mainly driven by Tusker Lager, accounted for about 74 per cent of EABL&rsquo;s revenues compared to Uganda&rsquo;s 17 per cent and Tanzania&rsquo;s nine per cent.&ldquo;Of course we are not happy about the trend line of Tusker which has been there for a while,&rdquo; Karuku said, adding that Tusker Lite and the newly launched Tusker Cider posted good sales.EABL group MD Andrew Cowan, brought in from UK&rsquo;s unit in July last year, said the brewer will invest heavily in innovation to satisfy the demanding Kenyan consumers.&ldquo;The Kenyan consumer is dynamic, curious, wants to try new things, very contemporary,&rdquo; Cowan said. &ldquo;The pace of Kenyan consumers is much more dynamic than I was used to, and that means that the marketing teams ...pursuing and have more deep insight of Kenyan consumers.&rdquo; The company plans to invest in Senator Keg plant in the second half, Cowan said.
