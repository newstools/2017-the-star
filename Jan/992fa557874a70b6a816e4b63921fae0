June Gachui&rsquo;s much-anticipated album launch recently went live after months of planning, and it was a night that will be spoken about for years to come. The showcase was hosted at the Kenya National Theatre with a full house of 350 fans, among them fellow artistes, thespians, media and social personalities from across Nairobi. June opened the stage with an endearing performance of &lsquo;Everything is Fine&rsquo;. Other amazing acts included June&rsquo;s collaboration with Blinky Bill, &lsquo;Holla&rsquo;; &lsquo;Everybody&rsquo;, featuring Khaligraph Jones; a moving performance with her sister Angie in memory of their dad, James Gachui, &lsquo;My Forever Song&rsquo;; and Olivia Ambani&rsquo;s &lsquo;Better than just fine&rsquo;.
