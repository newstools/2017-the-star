Kalonzo Musyoka has reiterated that he will write to the ICC about incitement remarks against Kambas allegedly issued by Aden Duale.The Wiper leader first said this on January 9, after the emergence of an audio clip of youths in Garissa being told to attack Kambas and keep them from voting.Duale, who is Garissa Town MP and National Assembly majority leader, denied that he was the one giving the instructions.Kalonzo said if police do not take action against him, Cord will notify the ICC about the remarks, which he says if actualised will lead to genocide, forcible eviction or war crimes.More on this: I will call ICC on Duale remarks, Kalonzo warnsAlso read: [AUDIO] Duale dismisses audio of incitement against Kamba voters as concocted propagandaBut Kalonzo noted, in an address in Garissa on Saturday, that a Kenyan who engages in misdeeds does not necessarily have to be taken to The Hague.He said the constitution has domesticated international law, making it possible for a case to be handled locally, especially after Cord "takes over" after the August 8 general election." Any citizen has the freedom, under the supreme law, to live and work anywhere in Kenya and not be discriminated against on tribal basis," he said.He spoke during the homecoming ceremony for former deputy speaker Farah Maalim, before which he opened the party's office and visited Garissa University Memorial Park where he planted a tree.Al Shabaab militants attacked the university on April 2, 2015, killing 147 people, mostly students.Maalim, who has joined Wiper party as its deputy leader, echoed the Cord co-principal's sentiment that Duale has fanned ethnic hatred.Wiper chairman David Musila and Kitui Governor Julius Malombe said the majority leader has targeted Kamba voters after sensing Jubilee will be defeated in the poll.Read: Duale belongs in jail, Farah Maalim says after alleged incitement remarksThe national cohesion team launched investigations to unravel the voice in the incitement audio.NCIC chairman Francis ole Kaparo told the Star on phone that the commission's probe will be centred on establishing the veracity of the two-minute clip."We have dispatched our detectives to establish where the audio was recorded and advise on further action," said Kaparo, who said he was alerted by a colleague.The chairman noted no one is above the law and that Duale will be dealt with accordingly should he be found responsible.Duale said he was not afraid of the International Criminal Court as he has been there several times.More on this: NCIC opens probe on incitement audio clip linked to DualeAlso read: [AUDIO] I am not afraid of ICC, Duale tells Kalonzo on incitement clipOthers who attended the rally were Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho, womanrepresentative Mishi Mboko and MPs Makali Mulu (Kitui Central), Marcus Muluvi (Kitui East) and Rashid Bedzimba (Kisauni, ODM), and Kiminini's Chris Wamalwa who represented Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang'ula.Joho said no amount of intimidation will make him abandon his political beliefs.
