Versatile defender Humphrey Okoti is weighing his options as he approaches the last months of hiscontract with SportPesa Premier league side, Bandari.The stocky defender revealed that he has six months before his deal with the Dockers expires and he is considering a moveaway from the club as he seeks to lengthen his playing career.&ldquo;I have only six months left on my current contract. I have tried to get in touch with the officials (Edwin Oduor) so that I canknow what the future holds for me but to no avail. I am assuming that this will be my last deal with Bandari,&rdquo; remarked thestocky center half. Okot revealed he has already been approached by several clubs and Posta Rangers have especially shownkeen interest in him hence Bandari were seemingly determined to hold onto him.&ldquo;I have gotten informal approaches from some teams but as a player who is under contract, I have asked them to engage withmy club. Indeed, Posta are among the teams that have approached me but they are unable to get a deal with Bandari. Hopefully,everything will be clear for me before the transfer window closes,&rdquo; Okoti disclosed. The defenders wealth of experience in a topflight league that is increasingly being dominated by youthful attackers will come in handy for any club but having worked withcoach Sammy Omollo at Tusker, the duo were keen to reunite at least one last time as Okoti now is in the twilight of his career.&lsquo;We had good moments with Pamzo (when we won the league) and naturally I would be happy to work with him but right now,I am fully focussed on going for pre-season to see what the new coach (Paul NKata) has in store for me,&rdquo; the 31-year-old said.Nkata joined Bandari having led Tusker to yet another league title but Okoti conceded though he did not know the Ugandantactician at a personal level, his record speaks for itself. &ldquo;Obviously from his work with Muhoroni and Tusker, Nkata is a goodcoach and I am looking forward to work under him and hopefully his working style can bring some silverware to Bandariparticularly after the disappointments of last season,&rdquo; concluded the defender.
