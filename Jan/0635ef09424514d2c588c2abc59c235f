ODM has extended the deadline for submission of nomination papers by 10 days for lack of enough aspirants, especially in its Nyanza bedrock.Hopefuls had until December 31 last year to return nomination forms to Orange House and pay fees. The new primaries rules were meant to put an end to the chaotic nominations that previously marred the party&rsquo;s elections. But the rules seem to have boomeranged on the party, going by the low turnout at Orange House.Ordinarily, ODM would have been overwhelmed by many applications, but nomination debacle fears coupled with the December deadline saw the party experience an unprecedented low turnout. Expected aspirants, most of whom are civil servants, are yet to resign from their positions. The law requires them to leave civil service jobs six months to the general election, meaning they have until February 8 to resign to be eligible to run.The Star has established there is apathy among aspirants. Sources say Nyanza, the party&rsquo;s stronghold, was the most hit by apathy, with some incumbent governors, senators and MPs failing to meet the December 31 deadline.Kisumu, Migori, Homa Bay, Kisii and Nyamira had just a handful of aspirants who had complied with the nomination regulations. This forced the National Elections Board led by Judy Pareno (pictured) to go back to the drawing board. The team held a day-long meeting attended by some members of the National Executive Council to analyse the situation before Raila was contacted and a decision was made to extend the deadline.
