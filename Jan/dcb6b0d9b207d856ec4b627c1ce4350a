DP William Ruto has been accused of disrespecting the independence of parties by handpicking allies to unseat opposition leaders. ODM council member Amos ole Mpaka said Ruto is imposing a candidate for the Baringo Senate seat to run against Kanu's Gideon Moi."Baringo residents are not insane to be led like sheep. We have seen categorically that he DP has only one agenda in Baringo of removing Gideon Moi from power," Ole Mpaka said on Sunday.He made the remarks after Ruto asked Betting Control and Licensing Board chair Simon Chelugui to ditch his bid for governor and vie for the Baringo Senate seat.He also cited the DP's "interference" with the location of Baringo University, as well as unfulfilled promised to curb persistent insecurity in the region as a result of Pokot bandits.He also noted stalked Karandi-Marigat road which was to have been completed by 2017 and has not even been started and the proposed Loruk Divisional headquarters also remain as a proposal.He said Ruto has been frequently visiting Baringo yet he has nothing to show of his leadership."His only project is that Gideon Moi must go," the ODM official said.More on this: Gideon Moi is uncircumcised, says DP RutoAlso read: Senator Moi cannot match me academically, says DP RutoHe asked residents to refuse to be used by the DP as pawns in his parochial games."Let the people of our county because they are sane and intelligent to elect their own leaders without fear or favour," he said.Ole Mpaka asked Kanu to join opposition parties in the Nasa alliance to overdraw Jubilee in this year's election."Nasa is your home and it is friendly to all parties, unlike Jubilee, which has adopted the tact of handpicking leaders," Ole Mpaka said.He said Gideon should not put his faith in Jubilee, since it lacks democracy.He said the Nasa coalition is the future of the country and will salvage it from runaway cases of corruption and impunity propagated by the Jubilee administration."For us to have a better future, free of corruption, Kenyans should vote out Jubilee " he added.
