The recent endorsement of ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi as Luhya spokesperson is likely to renew historic rivalry between the Bukusu and Maragoli sub-tribes, analysts say.Robinson Kisunia, a political analyst from Webuye, said Mudavadi has always been self-centred and has never supported any other leader from Western."When it comes to fighting for the common mwananchi, Mudavadi has always been on the back seat unlike the likes of Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang'ula who have always been fighting for the oppressed," he said."We are not in line with Mudavadi's appointment because the research was not inclusive because we have elders like (Wycliffe) Wangamati who were not consulted over he matter,'' he added while speaking to the Star.More on this: Wangamati&rsquo;s anti-Mudavadi remarks are personal, not the community&rsquo;s &ndash; eldersMudavadi was crowned on December 31, 2016 in a colourful ceremony organised by Cotu boss Francis Atwoli.Notably missing from the event was Wetang'ula, former Lugari MP Cyrus Jirongo and Kakamega Senator Bonny Khalwale.Wetang'ula later dismissed the coronation, saying the community does not need a spokesperson but needs someone Luhyas listen to when he speaks.Read: Mudavadi an envelop spokesperson &mdash; MPThe development mirrors a long-standing superiority battle between the Bukusu and Maragoli sub-tribes.While Bukusus have always boasted of coming from the first wife of the Mulembe house, the Maragoli lay claim to being more learned.The Luhya community is made up of more than 15 sub-tribes."The way in which the spokesperson was selected was not an inclusive way and that's why you see a lot of murmuring especially from the Bukusus who feel like Wetang'ula or someone from the Bukusu sub-tribe should have been given the chance," Kisunia said.He said a spokesperson ought to be a person who is firm and stable in his politics."Not someone who can easily be bought or used to sell the community,"Also read: 'Anointed' Mudavadi fronted as NASA's preferred presidential candidateRead: Accept Mudavadi's spokesperson post or lose political mileage, Wetang'ula toldBut Evaline Muronja, a political activist in Bungoma, appealed to Luhyas to stick together and have one of their own lead them in critical matters."We all know Wetang'ula is ours, Mudavadi is also ours, and since they endorsed Mudavadi we are appealing to all Luhyas to stick to that for the sake of the community moving forward."Monraja said if Mudavadi fails, the community can always appoint someone else in future.
