Tanzania&rsquo;s economy grew 6.2 per cent in the third quarter of 2016 compared with 6.3 per cent in the same period the previous year, Finance and Planning Minister Philip Mpango said on Monday. The country&rsquo;s economy has been growing robustly, helped by expansion in the transport, mining, communications and finance sectors. Mpango reaffirmed a forecast of 7.2 per cent growth for the financial year ending June 2017. The expansion was higher than Kenya&rsquo;s, which was estimated at 5.7 per cent, compared with six per cent a year earlier. &ldquo;Generally, the economic growth was well spread although most of the sectors of the economy recorded slowed growths,&rdquo; Kenya National Bureau of Statistics said on December 23. &ldquo;The performance of various agricultural crops varied widely.&rdquo;
