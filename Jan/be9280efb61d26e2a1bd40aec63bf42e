Bumula MP Boniface Otsiula yesterday told off civil society groups and individuals challenging the nomination of Wafula Chebukati for IEBC chairman on grounds of regional imbalance in the commission if he serves with CEO Ezra Chiloba.Chebukati and Chiloba come from the same community.Otsiula said no constitutional provision is violated for the two to serve at the IEBC and critics&rsquo; argument is based on the Public Policy provision.&ldquo;When the IEBC chair job was advertised, they should have said Luhyas should not apply as the first condition because Chiloba is the CEO. Chebukati applied as any other qualified Kenyan constitutionally entitled to apply for any job within the country,&rdquo; the MP said.&ldquo;Applications were done in a normal way, people were shortlisted and interviewed. How come when somebody emerges successful you start to challenge it because of tribe or region? &rdquo;It is illegal to favour certain communities for public jobs on either regional or tribal grounds, Otsiula said. &ldquo;People should stop bringing an element of tribalism in whatever we do,&rdquo; he said.
