A section of Luos in Mombasa have refuted claims that Governor Hassan Joho has sidelined them.The community members accused "two or three political brokers" of lying to ODM leader Raila Odinga about their state.Charles Rambo, the group's leader, said at a hotel in Nyali that they were fully behind Joho as he has "solidly" supported them."[The two or three people] cannot speak for the whole community," Rambo said during a meeting with Raila on Tuesday. "They are rebels who do not have the interests of ODM at heart."The group accused MCAs Duncan Onyango (Mikindani), Jabess Oduor (Kongowea) and Mary Akinyi (Nominated) of being used by Jubilee to destabilise ODM. Rambo said they were doing so out of frustration and that the outspoken county chief has awarded plum jobs, including the administration of seven wards, to the Luo.Read: Rowdy youths disrupt Raila rally in Changamwe as Coast political rows play outThe group further said that the team was working in cahoots with Nyali MP Hezron Awiti"Let them not confuse the Luo community. We will die with Joho the way Joho is dying with our Raila," Rambo said.Awiti could not be reached for comment as he was unavailable on phone.But Oduor and Onyango maintained that Joho has been frustrating the Luo community members.The two said they supported Joho before and after election but that the Governor had changed."I even advertised Joho on my billboards for free but after election, the first thing he did was destroy all of them," Oduor said.But Stephen Ochieng said Oduor and his group were playing victim."They were elected but have failed to deliver. Now they are looking for excuses," he said Onyango said the decision to expel five perceived rebel MCAs from all committees was not a party decision."It was a decision by an individual who we all know," he said.Margaret Onyango said ODM was a sinking ship before Joho rescued it."It is Joho's enthusiasm that salvaged the party here in Mombasa. We will not turn our backs against him," she said.
