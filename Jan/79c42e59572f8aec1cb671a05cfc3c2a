Kenya is grappling with acute shortage of skilled artisans with practical skills to support economic growth, Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang&rsquo;i said yesterday. He said a development partner wanted to offer 3,000 jobs for artisans, but there were none.Matiang&rsquo;i said this is because students continue to despise practical skills training programmes offered at the technical and vocational education and training, choosing to study for degrees and acquire qualifications that are not relevant to the job market.&ldquo;We are developing a programme for one million artisans because we are looking for artisans to provide skilled workforce,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have enough for our own market, so we can&rsquo;t have any to export.&rdquo;The CS said last year, universities graduated 9,000 with bachelor of arts degrees, while 15, 000 others obtained bachelor of science in &ldquo;insignificant courses&rdquo;, widening the scope of too many graduates with no skills.Matiang&rsquo;i said such graduates may keep looking for nonexistent jobs because of ignoring skills that are on high demand in the job industry.&ldquo;More than 80 per cent of students in universities, including private ones, are enrolled for bachelor of arts degrees, including BA in theology. This is okay because we need all those degrees, but where are the jobs?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That is why I am challenging all the clerics here to come looking for an interim certificate to start Presbyterian University of Technology.&rdquo;The CS was speaking at the Safaricom Stadium Kasarani during the inauguration of 2,800 TVET students to be sponsored by Equity Bank&rsquo;s Wings to Fly programme for two-year diploma programmes. Matiangi&rsquo;s admission adds credence to the paradox that employers are perpetually seeking employment from a pool of graduates.TVET institutions that offer such skills are seen as a reserve for academic failures and students would rather study for &ldquo;useless&rdquo; degrees in universities, rather than do diploma or certificate courses in such institutions.Matiang&rsquo;i said despite the government giving loans to students in public TVET institutions, little has been achieved. He said the government set aside Sh800 milion loans for TVET students, but less than a third of it was taken up because there were no applicants.
