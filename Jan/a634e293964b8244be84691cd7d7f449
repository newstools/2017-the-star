Five Kakamega MPs have termed inconsequential the Saturday unveiling of Musalia Mudavadi as the Luhya kingpin in Bukhungu Stadium.Benjamin Washiali (Mumias East), David Were (Matungu), Emmanuel Wangwe (Navakholo), Malulu Injendi (Malava), Benard Shinali (Ikolomani), former ODM national youth leader Rashid Mohammed and former Minister Amukowa Anangwe vowed to work with the Jubilee administration and support President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s reelection.They spoke in a parallel rally at Shibale market in Mumias on Saturday. Were said Mudavadi is an &ldquo;envelop spokesperson&rdquo; and does not represent the community&rsquo;s interests. Washiali said Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli should have focussed on popularising Mudavadi&rsquo;s presidential ambition, instead of wasting time unveiling him as their spokesperson. &ldquo;The Luhya nation is made up of more than 18 sub-tribes. Which language will the spokesperson use? All these sub-tribes don&rsquo;t share a common language,&rdquo; Washiali said.He said Uhuru commands more than 248 MPs in the National Assembly, hence his reelection is inevitable.&ldquo;When we went to the 2013 election, Uhuru and DP William Ruto managed to get 161 MPs from TNA and URP. Then 52 more legislators joined Jubilee from other parties,&rdquo; Washiali said.&ldquo;This included Mudavadi&rsquo;s UDF and Eugene Wamalwa&rsquo;s New Ford Kenya. When we merged, 35 opposition MPs crossed over to Jubilee. This makes a total of 248 MPs.&rdquo; They dismissed Mudavadi&rsquo;s 39 per cent rating in Western.
