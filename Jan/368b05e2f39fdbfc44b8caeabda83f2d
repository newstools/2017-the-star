Heckling your leaders is outdated, archaic, barbaric and no way to win votes, Bungoma Governor Kenneth Lusaka yesterday told the youth. He urged them to be tolerant and mature in exercising their democratic rights. &ldquo;All leaders are welcome to Bungoma county to sell their manifestos and agenda. Just listen to them instead of shouting and causing chaos in the name of supporting another political camp, and make your own decisions during voting on August 8,&rdquo; Lusaka said at Chwele market.On Monday hostile youths blocked Deputy president William Ruto and his entourage from the Bungoma bus stage. Ruto, who was travelling from Mumias, was forced to use another route to Kanduyi market. Ruto&rsquo;s office, however, denied he was heckled. Officials said he was not scheduled to hold any meeting at the Bungoma bus station.primitive behaviour&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s allow all political leaders, including those in Jubilee and the opposition, to visit our county and sell their agenda. Let them be free to visit us,&rdquo; Lusaka said.&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s avoid creating unnecessary fear in our leaders. ODM leader Raila Odinga is free to visit us, Deputy President William Ruto is also free to visit this county. Our leaders, like presidential candidate Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula, are also free to visit other counties and sell their manifestos. Let&rsquo;s be tolerant of each other.&rdquo;His sentiments were echoed by Bungoma Senate aspirant Juma Mukhwana, who urged the youth not be used for some leaders&rsquo; selfish interests.&ldquo;We should respect all leaders despite not supporting their political affiliations. Leaders are free to tell us what they can do if elected. Shouting them down is not the solution, but a display of our primitivity,&rdquo; he said.
