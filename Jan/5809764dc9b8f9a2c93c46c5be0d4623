The Association of Gaming Operators-Kenya have asked the High Court to suspended a new law which introduced levying of betting taxes.The association says the law is unconstitutional and should not be implemented until a case challenging it is determined.Gaming operators sued the Betting Control and Licensing Board, Interior Cabinet Secretary Joseph Nkaissery, Kenya Revenue Authority commissioner general John Njiraini, Speaker of the National Assembly Justin Muturi, Senate speaker Ekwee Ethuro and the Attorney-General Githu Muigai.In its suit papers, the association says the new taxes will be collected by permit holders and remitted by the 20th day of the month.And the first remittance with respect to betting tax, lottery tax, gaming tax, prize competition tax and winning tax is due on February 20.The law being challenged was assented to by President Uhuru Kenyatta on September 13, 2016. This law amended betting Act and introduced levying of betting, lottery, gaming, prize and winning tax on license and permit holders.The association believes that the process of enactment of the law to the extent that it amended the betting Act is unconstitutional.The court was told the new law does not provide mechanisms for appeal or review of the administrative action of amending the betting Act.In effect, the court was told, the new law varies the permit and licences issued by betting control board during the subsistence of the permits without affording the licensees who are its members an opportunity to show cause against the variations.
