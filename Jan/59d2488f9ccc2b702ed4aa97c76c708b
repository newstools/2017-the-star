Kitui Senator David Musila has urged the President to stand by the Constitution and request punishment of National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale. The Garissa Township MP is alleged to have incited residents to prevent Kambas in Garissa from registering as voters. The audio of the alleged incitement is on social media. Duale says it&rsquo;s a fabrication. Musila said quick action should be taken so Kenyans do not believe a Jubilee supporter is untouchable if they violate the law. He said other leaders have been arrested for hate speech and so should Duale.
