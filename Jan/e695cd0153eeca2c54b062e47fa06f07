More than 100 Baringo county schools are on the verge of closure because of an acute shortage of water.Baringo North, Tiaty and Baringo South subcounties, where the Pokot, Tugen and Ilchamus pastoral communities live, have been hardest hit by a drought.Silale MCA Nelson Lotela told the Star on Sunday that about 30 schools in Tiaty will be closed if no solutions are found.They include Natan, Doplen, Riongo, Naudo, Nasorot, Silale, Nalekat and Napeikore primary schools in his ward, Lotela said in Kabarnet town.He asked Benjamin Cheboi's government to find money to help the more than 2,000 pupils.&ldquo;There is enough food in Riongo Primary School but there is no water for cooking,&rdquo; he reported, noting more than 20 ECD centres were closed.He said the water source the learners relied on dried up last week.Lotela said Riongo, Doplen and Akwichatis health centres could also be closed.Saimo/Kipsaraman MCA Richard Kampala said at least 12 schools in Baringo North faced the same fate.Kampala listed Kagir, Kosile, Ngaratuko, Moinonin, Kapsebeiwa, Kamenjo, Akoroyan, Arusin, Kapkoles, Chebarsiat, Chepkoi and Barsuswo primary schools as most affected."Head teachers may be forced to close the schools indefinitely," he said.Kampala said at least 600 people from Akoroyan, Loruk and Yatia sublocations have been travelling 20km to Lake Baringo to get water for domestic use.The MCA blamed cattle rustlers suspected to be from the Pokot community, who raided the area last year destroying boreholes and stealing mortars, 10 solar panels and pipes used for water supply.Read: Do not agitate killer Pokot bandits, Baringo residents now toldOther residents have been forced to cross the drying Kerio River with their animals in search of water and pasture in Elgeyo Marakwet county.Barwessa MCA Joseph Makilap regretted that more than 500 cattle have died because of the drought.Makilap said the schools most affected in the area included Kuikui, Ayatya, Torolokwonin, Barwessa, Marigut and Kinyach.
