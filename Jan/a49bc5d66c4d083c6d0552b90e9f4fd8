Nominated Senator Joy Gwendo has said she will not decamp to the opposition as Luos should not "put all their eggs in one basket".Gwendo said she will vie for the Kisumu East parliamentary seat on a Jubilee ticket. She said she decided to "go against the grain" for the benefit of the community, and that she did not regret her membership.The Senator said those spreading the rumour that she quit Jubilee for the opposition will be disappointed.&ldquo;Most people think that being Luo means I should join Cord or NASA but that is not the case,&rdquo; said Gwendo.&ldquo;We the Luo community need to be in different parties,. Let other Luos be in Cord... Let me remain in Jubilee."She added that those hoping she moves are guided by negative ethnicity.The National Alliance Party, Kisumu county branch, expelled Gwendo from the party in May 2015 over gross misconduct.Branch Coordinator Juma Midigo said the party made the decision as she was working with their rivals and was not propagating the party&rsquo;s ideals.Gwendo declined to comment on the matter saying she was not the leader of the party.More on this: Joy Gwendo axed from TNA over supporting CordAlso read: Senator Joy Gwendo may lose her seatThe politician spoke in Kisumu on Monday when she donated a 5,000 litre tank to Oasis of Hope Secondary School.She said she will make similar donations to other schools and churches in the the county.
