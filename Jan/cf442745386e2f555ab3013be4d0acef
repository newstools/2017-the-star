Clinical officers have demanded fair compensation for their heavy workload.Talks are ongoing on an MoU between the interim union of clinical officers, the Kenya Clinical Officers&rsquo; Association and the Public Service Commission, Health ministry, Salaries and Remuneration Commission and the Council of Governors.The officers said, &ldquo;Enough is enough with the discrimination that has been blatantly displayed against us in comparison to other health professionals.&rdquo;Meeting with Kisumu Health executive Elizabeth Ogaja, they said they can sit together and discuss how to conduct business moving forward.Clinical officers demand Sh50,000 clinical allowance, besides the health service allowance, saying they have the first contact with patients and are exposed to many risks.Harmonised salariesKUCO deputy secretary Austine Oduor said salaries of health practitioners must be harmonised so they are treated with respect.He said they postponed their strike after the CoG showed commitment, adding that their talks will continue until they reach an agreement.Oduor said after the first week of their negotiations, health service allowance has been introduced for all cadres and pegged at Sh15,000 for job group M and above and Sh20,000 for lower job groups.He said their emergency call allowance, which they proposed at Sh30,000, has been pegged at Sh10,000.&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say this is the final decision, but we&rsquo;re still going to look at the matter as we tackle other demands,&rdquo; Oduor said. Other demands include the risk allowance to be increased from Sh3,000 to Sh15,000 per month.
