The manufacturing sector is poised for a sluggish growth this year owing to the current political climate as the country heads into the general elections, industry players have said.The Kenya Association of Manufacturers says Foreign Direct Investments and business ventures are expected to shrink this year, as investors adopt a &ldquo;wait-and-see&rdquo; approach due to uncertainty ahead of the August 8, polls.&ldquo;Traditionally there has been a slow down around the election year. Most people don&rsquo;t put in additional investments as they wait and see how the political scene will play out,&rdquo; KAM CEO Phyllis Wakiaga told the Star in an interview.The political uncertainty is likely to further dent the sector&rsquo;s growth which recorded a slow growth in 2016, as industries struggled to cope in a tough business environment, characterised by massive layoffs and closure of some businesses.Manufacturing grew by a paltry 1.9 per cent in the third quarter of 2016, compared to a 3.5 per cent growth it had recorded in a similar period in 2015, according to the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics.&ldquo;Despite that, we still think the sector will do ok but will not grow as it would in a normal year,&rdquo; Wakiaga said.Local manufacturers are however expected to perform at above average, KAM Chairperson Flora Mutahi said. &ldquo;Kenyans have to eat, Kenyans have to drink. The elections might slow down our growth but otherwise I don&rsquo;t think it will take away much. Considering the last election things went well, we are a bit confident investors will not panic as previously,&rdquo; Mutahi said.She called on politicians and the general public to uphold peace for the growth of the economy saying : &ldquo;The economy is too important to actually let it go down the drain,&rdquo;The sector has in the last five years suffered from cheap imports, counterfeits, high cost of power and double taxation by both the national and county governments.It is estimated that Kenyan manufacturers are losing at least 40 per cent of their market share to counterfeiters, according to KAM, which has &ldquo;unfairly&rdquo; reduced the industry&rsquo;s earnings.&ldquo;Our exports have stagnated at 15 per cent of gross domestic product, while imports have grown to 40 per cent of GDP, creating a trade imbalance, weakening the Kenyan shilling and increasing inflationary pressure,&rdquo; Wakiaga said.Major local industries have closed business in the last five years. They include battery maker Eveready, which shut down its Nakuru plant over cheap imported batteries.Last year, tyre manufacturer Sameer Africa announced it would close its Mombasa Road manufacturing plant in favour of imports from China and India. The World Bank last year warned that cheap Chinese imports may hurt Kenya&rsquo;s bid to industrialise under the ambitious Vision 2030 development blueprint, with a possible closure of some industries.
