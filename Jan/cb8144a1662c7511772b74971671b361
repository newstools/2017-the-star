Against almost all predictions, property tycoon and reality TV personality Donald J Trump shall be the 45th President of the United States. As has been noted, not for decades had someone who has never held public office even contested the presidency, let alone won.Trump&rsquo;s triumph was based on many factors, some historical, some contemporary. But to begin with, whatever his comfortable electoral-vote margin (304 to Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s 277), let&rsquo;s recall just how narrow it was: only some 80,000 votes (just 0.06 percent of the national total of nearly 129 million) spread across three key &lsquo;swing&rsquo; states: Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, while garnering nearly three million fewer votes than Clinton (though what the outcome would have been had the contest been a Kenya-type winner-take-all for the entire country remains unclear). Why Trump wonVarious factors account for Trump&rsquo;s razor-thin win in these and several other &lsquo;swing&rsquo; states. One was his image as a &lsquo;new broom&rsquo; to clean up a &lsquo;rotten system&rsquo; of self-serving politicians and bureaucrats in Washington that energised a significant number of people of all ages to vote for the first time. Another was Clinton&rsquo;s failure to win over enough of those (especially young) voters who helped give Senator Bernie Sanders 43 per cent of all votes cast in the Democratic Party&rsquo;s primary contests. A third was the (however small) drop in voter turnout among (mostly male) African Americans who had voted for Barack Obama in the previous two elections; indeed, the proportion of this section of the electorate who voted for Trump was double what Republican Mitt Romney received from it four years earlier. Beyond these &lsquo;deeper&rsquo; factors was the announcement by FBI Director James Comey less than two weeks to the election, that a new batch of emails found on the laptop of the estranged husband of her top aide (Huma Abedin) would be examined to see if they contained any classified information originating from Clinton, thereby re-opening the earlier similar investigation against her. By the time Comey announced, just two days before the election, that this examination had yielded &ldquo;nothing new&rdquo;, her lead in the national polls had fallen by nearly half (from 5.7 to 2.9 per cent, or from an 81 per cent chance of winning to 65 per cent (as reported by www.538.com). Post-election, Clinton herself issued a statement blaming Comey for her loss, later making the same claim about the impact of Russia&rsquo;s hacking of Democratic National Committee computers, as verified by 17 US intelligence agencies.Yet, ironically, many of the same factors that dashed Clinton&rsquo;s hopes are likely to limit Trump&rsquo;s tenure at the White House to (at most; see below) a single, four-year term. And here it should be noted that American incumbents generally (aside from times of war) do not enjoy the bountiful &lsquo;benefits of incumbency&rsquo; seen in most African countries, where widespread poverty, inadequate independence of key institutions and the weakness (or even total absence) of the ideological &lsquo;glue&rsquo; holding disparate opposition forces together put a premium on the state largesse at their disposal, whether legal or otherwise (recent African incumbent losses in Malawi, Senegal, Nigeria, Ghana and the Gambia notwithstanding).One, as suggested above, is that much of the &lsquo;Trump&rsquo; vote was really only an anti-Clinton one, based on three main factors: her trust-deficit due to her email scandal and other actions as Secretary of State; the legacy of her husband&rsquo;s own misdeeds in the White House (e.g., the Monica Lewinsky scandal); and her close association with Obama (a negative one, especially for those voters who never accepted a non-white as their President). As such, no other future Democratic challenger will be weighed down by such &lsquo;heavy&rsquo; baggage. Indeed, it is certain that the moment anyone announces an interest in competing for the party&rsquo;s presidential nomination (for which there will be no deficit of aspirants), he or she will be subjected to a level of moral and legal scrutiny that will make even the FBI blush, and which almost certainly would have precluded Clinton&rsquo;s candidacy this time.Untenable promisesSecond, and probably more important, President Trump will be unable to keep most of the (76, according to The Washington Post as of early January) promises he made during his campaign, and the consequences of many of those that he does or even tries to will have disastrous consequences for his future. Let us take just six of them (even if he has already &lsquo;walked-back&rsquo; at least nine key ones since the election):#1: &ldquo;American companies with major production centres abroad that do not close them down and move back home to create more jobs here will be punished with hefty import taxes levied on their goods.&rdquo; Due to far cheaper labour costs, few if any such companies will do this. And if Trump succeeds in getting his Republican-controlled Congress to impose them, the prices Americans must pay for their products (such as Apple computers and mobile phones made in China) will rise significantly.#2: &ldquo;The US will build a &lsquo;beautiful, huge wall&rsquo; on the Mexican border to stop illegal immigration, and the Mexican government will pay for it.&rdquo; Given that the people of Mexico also elect their president, it is improbable that any such leader would be willing to commit political suicide by helping a neighbouring leader, however powerful his country, to implement such a pledge. Indeed, the Mexican President has already scoffed at this notion.#3: &ldquo;US military leaders will produce a plan in 30 days to totally destroy ISIS.&rdquo; While within any organisation there is a range of views about the challenges it confronts, surely, if any such plan were possible, it would have been identified long ago. And to the extent that even a continuation of the recent rather modest success in eroding ISIS&rsquo; earlier gains has required and shall continue to require the close cooperation of various Muslim states, Trump&rsquo;s tirades against people of this faith will undermine this effort. So, too, will another of his promises: &ldquo;To recognise an undivided Jerusalem as the capital of Israel&rdquo;, effectively negating the UN-mandated &lsquo;two-state solution&rsquo;, and thus infuriating a significant proportion of the international community he would need to even continue with the Obama administration&rsquo;s modest level of success against such extremist groups.#4: &ldquo;There will be an across-the-board reduction in taxes by consolidating the present seven income brackets into three and increasing the standard deduction, while eliminating several taxes completely, including the &lsquo;estate&rsquo; (or inheritance) tax.&rdquo; It will probably take a while for most of the public to realise that the richest 1 per cent of the population would reap more than a third of the &lsquo;gains&rsquo; offered here. Far more serious, according to most economists, it would reduce national tax revenues by &ldquo;at least $10 trillion over the next decade&rdquo;, massively ballooning public debt &ndash; up to more than $7 trillion, according to the Tax Policy Centre, raising its proportion of GDP from 77 to 105 per cent, a serious danger to even an economy of this size &ndash; while possibly triggering a collapse in the dollar (thereby greatly raising consumer prices of all imported good). Yet at the same time, he (like Clinton) vowed to protect America&rsquo;s Social Security and Medicare (old age pension and health insurance) systems, which are already headed full-speed towards insolvency even without such a massive drop in tax-revenue.#5: &ldquo;The Europeans must pay their &lsquo;fare share&rsquo; for their own security through the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato), and if they refuse, the US will withdraw its forces from Europe.&rdquo; Even if a sound argument can be made that Nato is somewhat outdated and that US taxpayers &lsquo;unfairly&rsquo; carry nearly 75 per cent of its cost, it is this threat that has endeared Trump to Russia&rsquo;s Putin more than any other. Most immediate is whether Trump will accede to the latter&rsquo;s demand to withdraw Nato forces from their current positions near Russia&rsquo;s western border, the presence of which, given Putin&rsquo;s forcible annexation of Crimea and other actions, has helped to calm mounting fears, especially in Poland and the Baltic states. According to many security experts, including former US National Security Adviser and Secretary of State Prof Henry Kissinger, such a withdrawal would constitute &ldquo;the most dangerous encouragement to global instability since the Second World War&rdquo;, a view shared by several senior (Republican) US senators.#6: &ldquo;The use of such &lsquo;torture tactics&rsquo; as water-boarding will be fully exploited in the fight against terrorism.&rdquo; Although these measures have been ruled unconstitutional by US courts (and accepted as such by the CIA), such pledges make a candidate look &lsquo;tough&rsquo; to some people. Actual public opinion is rather to the contrary, however, with recent polls placing opposition to such methods in a range of 58 to 81 per cent (depending upon recent events and the precise phrasing of the question). Many other promises, if implemented, will likely further harm the new President. These include: to &lsquo;renegotiate&rsquo; the Iran nuclear arms agreement (which, in any case, is a multilateral one); to revoke US commitments to deal (however weakly, according to some) with the threat of global warming/climate change (i.e., the Paris Agreement) while encouraging a return to the use of &lsquo;dirty&rsquo; fossil fuels, starting with coal; to renegotiate if not &lsquo;tear up&rsquo; various international trade treaties; and to reverse the relative freedom that women enjoy (in consultation with their doctors) to make their own decisions regarding abortions, while cutting off government funding to Planned Parenthood (among many other issues) by filling the current and possible future vacancies on the Supreme Court with like-minded justices.This is not to say that there are not millions of Americans who would celebrate if these multiple promises are kept, or even if Trump fulfilled them and they did not produce the desired impact. At least in the short term, his massive tax-cuts, reduced environmental and labour protection-regulation could spike investor confidence, producing a measurable uptick in the US economy. At the same time, it seems that the basis for much of his support is based on his identity (white/male) and his symbolic, anti-establishment persona, rather than on expected (let alone tangible) performance.But in each case, whether implementing or back-tracking, in the face of reality, we shall begin to see many of the layers of his November 8 electoral support-base peeling away from him, realising that what they &lsquo;bought&rsquo; is not what they&rsquo;ve &lsquo;got&rsquo;. On top of all this, Trump may also suffer the outcomes of several other issues: recurrent accusations about alleged sexual misconduct (both within the US and abroad, the former generating a defamation suit filed within the last week, the latter &ndash; according to senior Intelligence officials &ndash; triggering potential national security risks), doubts about his taxation status (his recent returns still withheld from public scrutiny contrary to the norm for such candidates) and the ethical/conflict-of-interest issues associated with his global business interests, even if he has tried to neutralise them by handing over this responsibility to his children. And if all this wasn&rsquo;t enough, his recent &lsquo;disowning&rsquo; of the very intelligence agencies upon which he and his National Security team will have to depend (over their unanimous conclusion that the Russians/President Putin did indeed interfere with the US election &ndash; and in his favour) raises huge questions about his willingness to defend America&rsquo;s &lsquo;national interest&rsquo; as defined across the political divide for decades. And he has been strongly urged by various past and present government officials to desist from issuing tweets on critical issues, given that while such messages from a property tycoon or even a president-elect may not matter that much, a president&rsquo;s words certainly do. But will he stop?Mid-term electionsIn light of the above, the 2018 &lsquo;mid-term&rsquo; elections (in which all 435 seats in the lower House of Representatives and one-third of those in the Senate will be at stake) will be critical, though it seems whichever way they go, Trump will be the loser. Given the fact that the Democrats will be defending twice as many of these Senate seats as will the Republicans, and would also have to overcome several decades of gerrymandering of House of Representatives&rsquo; constituency boundaries by Republican-dominated state legislatures, Trump could well keep his initial &lsquo;tyranny of numbers&rsquo;. But if so, this will leave him bereft of excuses come 2020 when blamed for the impact of his &lsquo;successful&rsquo; legislative agenda. As two Stanford University political scientists noted some months ago, &ldquo;Voters generally do not punish candidates for being vague&rdquo;, and such vagueness &ldquo;allows voters to see what they want&rdquo; in such candidates. But no such luxury exits when you have power, especially without an opposition majority in the legislative branch that you can blame for either having forced you to make major compromises, or for failing to have achieved anything at all.On the other hand, should an early anti-Trump reaction sweep the Democrats back into majority status (at least in the lower House), they will then have the option to do exactly what the Republicans did to Obama since 2010 when they took over: bloc everything Trump tries to force through, and thereby this time make him and the Republicans take the blame for the &lsquo;dysfunctional government in Washington&rsquo; that was used so effectively against their Democratic rivals in this election. Whether the quite unprecedented boycott of the inaugural ceremony by more than 50 Democratic representatives gets the ball rolling in this direction remains to be seen.Whatever the case, two caveats should be added here: first, that the Democratic Party must avoid such a bitter internecine war, making it unable to unite around a viable candidate of its own in 2020; one who takes the party back to its contemporary roots of economic democracy in terms of a firm if modest level of redistribution of wealth and opportunity from the privileged few to the far less affluent many (of whatever race), most of whom have suffered the stagnation or decline in their real incomes over recent decades. And second, that Trump does not dramatically discard so many of these promises that by that time he is able to present himself as almost an entirely different candidate! (Remember: &lsquo;reality TV&rsquo; personalities can do anything, just to keep their audience ratings up!)However accurate the above 2020 prediction may be, we may never get to test it. According to Prof Allan Lichtman, one of the few analysts who predicted a Trump win long before the event, he will not even contest the next election, having been impeached before his first term is even over &ndash; by his own fellow Republicans! With Trump&rsquo;s pre-inaugural approval rating now below 40 per cent &ndash; itself an unprecedented low &ndash; (and only about one-third believing he will be &ldquo;a better President than Obama&rdquo;) the professor could be proven right even faster than he could imagine.And then there&rsquo;s always the obscure 25th Amendment to the Constitution, Section 4 of which allows for removal of a President who is &ldquo;unable to discharge the duties of his office&hellip;&rdquo; as determined by the Vice-President and a majority of the Cabinet, leading to the assumption of power by the VP in an &ldquo;acting&rdquo; capacity. Indeed, even before he&rsquo;s been sworn-in, some have suggested this would be a faster and &lsquo;cleaner&rsquo; way of putting VP Mike Pence in the Oval Office, once it becomes clear that Trump&rsquo;s erratic behaviour exceeds the limits that his own executive branch colleagues &ndash; and the Republican party writ large &ndash; can tolerate.Whatever happens after January 20, the US &ndash; and by extension, the rest of the world that is touched by the actions of the American president &ndash; is in unchartered territory.Dr. Wolf, a Research Analyst for Ipsos-Kenya has written this piece in his personal capacity.
