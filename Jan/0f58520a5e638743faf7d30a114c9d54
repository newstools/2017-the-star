The management of a city restaurant has accused the Consumer Federation of Kenya (COFEK) of hatching a plot to kick them out of business.This follows plans by the consumer body to hold demonstrations against them for 'being racist and failing the test of hospitality'.Cofek is said to have planned the protest following an incident where Kenya Wildlife Service chairman Richard Leakey was not served tap water.CEO Stephen Mutoro has maintained it will hold demonstrations in support of Leakey who is said to have bitterly argued with the hotel over the matter.The restaurant, which operates at the new Hub complex in Karen, is said to have told the conservationist that they do not serve tapped water.An argument ensued after Leakey insisted that he be offered what he had asked to be served at the high-end restaurant.Gianni Sganzerla, one of the owners said: "It was an unfortunate incident that should not have happened in the first place had Leakey been patient,""It is true Leakey asked for tap water. However we told him we do not serve that because we care about the welfare of our clients. ," he added."He should have understood the explanation he was being given. We do not serve out customers tap water for fear it may be contaminated," Sganzerla said.The restaurant is reportedly located in an area that is not served by the Nairobi Water and Sewerage Company. Most malls and households have dug boreholes, which according to Sganzerla, are at risk of being contaminated.La Cascina, through its lawyer Donald Kipkorir, said that the consumer rights body has blown the matter out of proportion 'to gain cheap publicity'."Dr Leakey has moved on from the matter. There are efforts to have him and the management iron out the differences," Korir said.He said they wondered why Cofek has insisted that it must hold demonstrations over the matter, further demanding action against the consumer rights group.Kipkorir said Mutoro should be held accountable for scandalising the restaurant by accusing its management of being racists."We want Mutoro be arrested and charged with spreading injurious falsehoods, extortion and misuse of digital media," Kipkorir stated in his letter."This is a clear indication they want to paint the restaurant in bad light and force us out of business. Cofek should take its time to know the facts," Sganzerla opined.A team from the County Council health department has visited the restaurant in the wake of the incident and have given it a clean bill.Read: Kidero defends Richard Leakey for demanding tap water at La Cascina restaurant, says Nairobi water safe
