Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho&rsquo;s star is rising and shining bright, thanks to his tough talk and feud with President Uhuru Kenyatta.Joho&rsquo;s supporters in Mombasa are organising a grand reception tomorrow or Thursday after he jets back from Ghana. His office did not confirm or deny the rally. He returns tomorrow.Joho scored points last week for scolding President Uhuru Kenyatta, saying he was taking credit for projects funded by the county and by donors.What appeared be punitive measures &mdash; withdrawal of Joho&rsquo;s security and filing KRA cases &mdash; outraged Joho&rsquo;s supporters and provided plenty of political fodder for the opposition.Yesterday the state backed down and restored his bodyguards. They were only moved in a routine reorganisation, the police explained, once again.Yesterday it also emerged that KRA has unconditionally withdrawn a case against Joho family freight businesses.KRA also unconditionaly withdrew suspension of the licenses for the two facilities. They had been accused of handling smuggled goods.Stung by Joho&rsquo;s accusations, State House listed billions of shillings of projects it initiated in Coast counties over four years. State House says lives have been transformed, Joho and others say the Coast is still marginalised.In addition to withdrawing Joho&rsquo;s security, the National Police Service had ordered 105 county inspectorate officers &mdash; traffic monitors &mdash; off the street. Joho ordered them to stay put.This created an uproar and boosted the governor&rsquo;s popularity. He has been able to portray himself as a victim of Jubilee machinations because he was loyal to ODM and refused to bend to Jubilee.Mombasa MCAs on Monday threatened to organise street protests if Joho&rsquo;s security is not reinstated in a week.The government has previously withdrawn Joho&rsquo;s bodyguards and suspended his firearms licences to show displeasure. They were later restored.Jubilee is trying hard to make inroads at the Coast, an ODM stronghold.Immediately after Joho told off the President, he travelled to Ghana with opposition leader Raila Odinga for the swearing in of President Nana Akufo-Addo.When they return Wednesday, they head to a mass opposition meeting at the Bomas of Kenya to focus on a broad alliance against Jubilee in August polls.
