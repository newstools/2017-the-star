A Massachusetts county sheriff has proposed sending prison inmates from around the United States to build the proposed wall along the Mexican border.The wall is one of US President-elect Donald Trump's most prominent campaign promises."I can think of no other project that would have such a positive impact on our inmates and our country than building this wall," Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson said at his swearing-in ceremony for a fourth term in office late Wednesday."Aside from learning and perfecting construction skills, the symbolism of these inmates building a wall to prevent crime in communities around the country, and to preserve jobs and work opportunities for them and other Americans upon release, can be very powerful," he said.Hodgson, who like Trump is a Republican, said that inmates from around the country could work together to build the proposed wall, which Trump describes as a powerful deterrent to illegal immigration.Trump, who will be sworn in on January 20, insisted during his campaign that he would convince the Mexican government to pay for the wall, though Mexican officials have repeatedly said they would not do so.Officials in the Trump transition office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.In response to a request by the Trump transition office, the Department of Homeland Security last month identified more than 400 miles (644 km) along the US-Mexico border where new fencing could be erected, according to a document seen by Reuters.The documents contained an estimate that building that section of fence would cost more than $11 billion.
