Nigeria must not scare away MTN, its minister of communications said, as lawmakers investigate alleged illegal money transfers just three months after the government fined Africa's biggest telecoms firm over $1 billion (Sh103.80 billion). The comments by Adebayo Shittu are the government's first statement on the latest investigation into MTN, indicating the government does not want to see the South African company punished unduly in Nigeria, its biggest market, if the latest allegations prove to be true. "Nobody will say that MTN is not important to Nigeria - we must encourage them, we must not scare them away from Nigeria," Shittu told Reuters in an interview, conducted on Friday. MTN, the largest mobile phone firm in Nigeria, threatened to pull out of the country last year during a dispute over unregistered SIM cards before the government agreed to reduce a settlement on the issue by nearly 70 percent to $1 billion. The company now faces another potentially hefty penalty if an investigation by Nigeria's upper house of parliament finds evidence that MTN Group Ltd illegally transferred $13.9 billion out of the West African country between 2006 and 2016, as alleged.
