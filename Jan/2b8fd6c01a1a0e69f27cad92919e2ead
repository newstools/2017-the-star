Western residents have been urged to stop demanding handouts from IEBC officials before will register as voters.ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi yesterday said he has received many reports that some residents want handouts. He said this will make the region lag behind in voter listing as other regions register in large numbers.Mudavadi was addressing elders at the Engo Resource Centre in Kitale, where he urged residents to register to vote on August 8. Meanwhile, he said the court ruling that more than 3 million title deeds issued by the Jubilee admnistration since 2013 were irregularly processed has put the owners of the documents in an awkward situation.&ldquo;Some people have already taken loans using the documents. The Jubilee administration is playing a game with Kenyans. Title deeds play a big role in land ownership and as security for loans&rdquo; Mudavadi said.He criticised the government for failing to honour a pact it signed with doctors in 2013, adding that 400 Kenyans have died because of the strike.&ldquo;Jubilee always disowns its agreements. They have also disowned an agreement with teachers and myself before the last poll,&rdquo; Mudavadi added. He accused the government of failing to plan to avert starvation in drought-prone regions.
