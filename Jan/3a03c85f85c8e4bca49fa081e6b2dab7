Danson Mungatana has distanced himself from the Sh51 million Kilifi county scandal saying he has never met the woman who implicated him.Businesswoman Lucy Wanjugu, the third defendant in a civil suit filed by the county, claimed Mungatana engineered the theft through IFMIS.Wanjugu, a director at Zohali Services, who said she was acquainted with Mungatana, claimed he made the request when they met last July.But the former Garsen MP told the Star in an SMS on Saturday that he had never met her.&ldquo;For purposes of setting the records clear, I do not know Wanjugu and I have neither dealt with her nor given her instructions, or received any money from her, or companies linked to her," he said.&ldquo;I operate no business other than my law firm, and the public know about it. I have not done any business with any county government including Kilifi."Mungatana asked Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi, who criticised him and investigators for summons over the scam, to allow the completion of investigations.He regretted that Kingi, who addressed the press on Friday, made conclusive statements about him yet the probe is ongoing.&ldquo;The purported affidavit the Governor referred to has not been served to me," he said, adding he will act accordingly once he receives the document.&ldquo;We know there are independent investigations going on. It is only fair and just that the respective bodies be allowed the opportunity to conclude this matter. The Governor must not cloud this investigations with partisan allegations intended to divert attention from real issues."The former MP further accused Kingi of reinstating key suspects in his administration, in an attempt to defeat the purpose of investigationsRead: Kingi blames IFMIS cartels for Sh51 million theft at Kilifi countyIn an affidavit last Thursday, the woman claimed the politician told her he was expecting some money and asked her to receive it on his behalf.&ldquo;He explained the request by emphasising the fact that his accounts were overdrawn and a credit of monies to them would swallow the same; he also stated that he needed the monies in cash form urgently, to offset liabilities that he had,&rdquo; read part of the affidavit.Zohali, through its account at Jamii Bora Bank in Nairobi, allegedly received Sh5.3 million from Kilifi county on October 4, 2016, without doing any business.Wanjugu claimed that on October 7 last year, a further Sh3.8 million was credited to the account. She said she did not know where the money would come from until she went to the bank to make a withdrawal for Mungatana and that she withdrew the money over several days.&ldquo;I later forwarded the money in cash to Mungatana, less VAT, and my nominal commission,&rdquo; she said in her two-page affidavit.More on this: Businesswoman drags Mungatana into Sh51 million Kilifi county scamKilifi's finance chief officer Ben Chilumo said in November last year that with the help of investigators they had traced Sh8 million.He denied reports that the county lost Sh1.18 billion through irregular payments to five Nairobi companies that never offered any services.
