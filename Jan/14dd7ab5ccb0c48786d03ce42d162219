The Lamu government on Saturday launched a Sh10 million relief distribution programme to assist over 50,000 vulnerablepeople affected by drought.The county is among the areas that are worst-hit by famine, leaving thousands of residents both in Lamu East and West in dire need of food and water.The county also announced that it is supplying clean water using boats to the affected areas. The water is being transported by boat to the Mtangawanda area, transferred into water boozers and later distributed to the villages.Speaking during the launch of the programme, Lamu Governor Issa Timamy said the relief food would be distributed to 20 villages, 10 in each subcounty.&ldquo;Due to the prolonged drought, the people of Lamu have a hard time in getting food. As a government, we have spent Sh10 million to buy relief food, which is being distributed to those affected,&rsquo;&rsquo; Timamy said. However, the governor said the funds available were not enough to sustain all the people and called on well-wishers and humanitarian organisations to get more engaged since nearly the whole county is affected. For the past two years, he said, the county has experienced crop failure due to rain failure, making it difficult for residents to access food and water.Among the villages that have benefitted include Koreni, Mkunubi, Hongwe, Witu, Bahati Njema, Shekale, Zebra, Pangani and Moa in Lamu West, while in Lamu East the food will be distributed to Basuba, Kiiwayu, Mkokoni, Mbwajumwali, Shanga and Ishakani, among others. In Faza, Timamy said, the county will sink more boreholes.
