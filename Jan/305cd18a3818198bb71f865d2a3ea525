Aspirants previously endorsed for elective posts in the August poll and then discarded have decided to go against the elders&rsquo; decision and chart their own political destiny.Ugas Sheikh Mohamed was endorsed by the Fai subclan sultanate on July 28 to contest for Wajir governor. He has told off Sultan Najib Fai two days after his rival Amb Mohamed Abdi was endorsed for Wajir governor.Ugas was accompanied by fellow disgruntled Wajir East parliamentary seat nominee Rashid Kassim during a rally at Orahey grounds in Wajir town on Tuesday.The duo vowed to continue with their campaigns and ensure their names are in the ballot. They added that the verdict by the elders was selfish since it only served the interests of a few individuals.&ldquo;We were not consulted and therefore we are not obliged to abide by the elders&rsquo; decision,&rdquo; Ugas said.Kassim said, &ldquo;Seven months ago, we were declared the nominees for the governor and Wajir East parliamentary seats. What happened to the original verdict?&rdquo; He urged residents to support them since they were replaced through &ldquo;a coup&rdquo;. On Saturday, Amb Abdi was named as Ugas&rsquo; replacement in a fresh verdict that has caused divisions within the community.
