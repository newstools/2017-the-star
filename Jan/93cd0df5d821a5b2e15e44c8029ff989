Few standard three pupils in public primary schools can do simple arithmetic.A national survey commissioned by Knec and the Education ministry showed only 4.5 per cent of them had attained level four competency, which requires a student to use multiple arithmetic operations on whole numbers in the correct order.Speaking yesterday during the launch of the National Assessment System for Monitoring Learner Achievement, Knec assessment centre chief Assumpta Matei said the numeracy and literacy levels of the pupils should concern everyone because they show a worrying, rising trend.Slightly more than a third have attained level three competency, and can translate information presented in a sentence into an arithmetic operation, add and subtract simple fractions and interpret simple common units of measurement, including days, weeks and shillings.The majority have attained levels one and two, which comprise basic mathematics.The National Assessment System for Monitoring Learner Achievement showed only 14.9 per cent can arrange words in alphabetical order in English, while only 10 per cent can do so in Kiswahili, which represents the basics in level 1. One-third can use correct punctuation in English, while at least 70 per cent can do so in Kiswahili. However, pupils still find it hard to read for meaning in both English and Kiswahili. The majority of the pupils can be grouped into level two, where the focus was on spelling and use of familiar words to complete simple everyday sentences.Boys seem to have performed slightly better in all levels of competency in numeracy, while girls performed better in all levels of literacy (English and Swahili).
