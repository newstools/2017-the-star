Kimunya is charged with Lillian Njenga, a director of Land Adjudication and Settlement, and Jughae Wainaina, chairman of Midlands Ltd, a company associated with the former minister.The trial resumed after Director of Public Prosecutions Keriako Tobiko rejected Kimunya&rsquo;s plea to settle the case out of court.
