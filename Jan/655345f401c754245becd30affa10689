Students who scored D and below have been asked to apply for courses at middle-level and technical colleges.According to the recent KCSE results, 295000 students scored D and below this has left parents in shock of the fate of their children. However, the Technical and Vocational Education and Training Authority says it has the capacity to absorb all such students and equip them with high-end technical skills.Speaking to the Star, Director General for the Technical and Vocational Educational and Training Authority Dr Kipkirui Langat has pointed out that the institutions have previously recorded a low number of students taking up courses in the middle-level colleges. He said the institutions recorded only 40 per cent enrollment of their total capacity, thus leaving the 60 per cent of the institutions vacant. &ldquo;Every student is pushing to secure a position at the university to get a degree and white collar job, leaving middle-level institutions with no students to undertake studies,&rdquo; Langat said. Currently, there are 70 technical institutions in the country fully equipped, among them 11 national polytechnics, placed strategically across the country. &ldquo;We have Kenya Technical Trainers college in Nairobi, Kabete, Nyeri, Meru, North Eastern, Eldoret, Kitale, Sigalagala, Kisumu, Kisii and Coast, which have the ability to accommodate all those students,&rdquo; Langat said. He said they are working on the construction of 130 other institutions to ensure that they increase capacity. Langat further pointed out that the upgrading of technical institutions like TUK and TUM has benefited the TVET institutions as the students can now proceed for their undergraduate upon completion of their Diploma.he said they can also receive loans."Many people do not really recognise that state funding of higher learning does not stop at university, but it also extends to technical and vocational colleges. They also receive an equivalent of a HELB loan," Langat said.
