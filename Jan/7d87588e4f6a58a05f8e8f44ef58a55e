After a gardener took to social media to expose KTN news anchor, Ben Kitili for failing to pay Sh 25,000 for services rendered, another one of his pals has spoken out about a debt he owes, from back in 2015.Christopher Waithaka claims that the&nbsp; KTN news anchor hit his car and damaged the bumper. The accident occurred on 12 Dec 2015 on Mombasa Road, on transit to Voi. The two were in a convoy of friends and family heading to funeral.Christopher said they had "a verbal mutual gentleman&rsquo;s agreement on 12 Dec 2015 on the accident site with two witnesses, present in the car at the time of accident."Ben Kitili was to pay 60% of the costs which amounted to 28,000 and Christopher pay the remaining 20,000 for the total cost of the repair of the bumper.Asked why they did not just hit let the insurance handle the costs, Christopher said that their friendship and the fact that they were in the middle of nowhere when it happened aided the decision.&nbsp;Adding that since they&nbsp;did not want to keep their friend captive as&nbsp; were heading to a funeral, it made sense to have the agreement.The last time Christopher spoke to Ben about the debt was in July 18, 2016 when he said he would settle the debt at the end of August.He has been waiting since then."I had actually forgiven him and given up because for me, it is not a significant amount of money," Christopher said, adding that the "world will catch up with him."Numerous calls to Ben Kitili went unanswered so did a text message asking for his comment.Check out the screenshots of their communication after the accident. &nbsp;
