West Pokot Governor Simon Kachapin was on Sunday installed by the Pokot Council of Elders as the community spokesperson at his birthplace in Muino.A section of elders have, however, disputed the installation, saying the community cannot have two spokespersons.This came after over 4,000 elders on Saturday endorsed West Pokot Senator John Lonyangapuo to vie for governor. In Baringo late last year, he was installed the Pokot&rsquo;s spokesperson.This has increased the political temperature in the region as the two position themselves to face off at the August polls.One of the elders, Solomon Mukenion, said the installation of Kachapin is invalid because he was elevated by elders from his own clan.&ldquo;For one to qualify to be a Pokot spokesperson, he must have contributed to huge initiatives in the community, which must have had a positiveimpact,&rdquo; Mukenion said.He said it took long before the community identified the successor to the late Francis Lotodo, who was the community&rsquo;s spokesperson.&ldquo;Before Lonyangapuo was installed as our spokesperson in Baringo, elders took time to see who was fit to replace the late Lotodo,&rdquo; he said.
