Fiscal policy in any government, is a delicate balancing act. And the determination of interest rates within Kenya, gives us a good example of this.On the one hand, our old fiscal regime in which interest rates were set by &ldquo;market forces&rdquo; led to Kenya having really high interest rates &ndash; hence many individuals as well as businesses would end up defaulting on their loans, as they simply could not sustain repayment at those very high rates.But ever since the very popular cap on interest rates was legislated into law, we have seen banks reduce their lending portfolios and new sources of credit dry up.This is reportedly on account of banks no longer having the margins they need to be able to take appropriate risks in their lending policies.What is a constant in all this, is that economic growth requires new investment; and such investment requires that banks lend freely.If indeed capped interest rates are proving to be a drag on economic growth, then it may be time to assess the benefits of these caps.
