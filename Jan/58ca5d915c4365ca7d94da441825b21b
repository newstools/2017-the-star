I want Kenyans to understand that we are not refusing to pay doctors," he said."If everybody goes on strike and I pay what they demand, what will we have in this country? Are you ready to be taxed more, or should we borrow more to pay doctors?"The doctors&rsquo; strike is unlikely to end before the Thursday deadline. And striking alongside the health workers are lecturers who also want a pay rise. Students have joined the strikes, making matters worse for the country that is also looking into solutions to drought.The public has complained via social media that despite all of the problems, the primary concern seems to be the registration of voters for the August 8 general election.Read:Doctors &lsquo;ready for jail&rsquo; as talks with state failOfficials of the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists&rsquo; Union said they were ready to be jailed for disobeying court orders to end the strike.Doctors are demanding a 300 per cent pay rise, giving an intern a monthly salary of Sh325,000 and specialists close to Sh1 million monthly pay.They have rejected all offers from the government, the last one being the 40 per cent pay rise offered by President Uhuru Kenya, which gave interns a Sh208,000 monthly salary.The Cabinet Secretary further noted that the country has been borrowing to be able to encourage investments and meet expenditure."We are borrowing to implement the budget and in view of the timelines we have, syndicated loans are much faster," he said."We are borrowing because we want to acquire infrastructure and encourage more investment."The CS said the government will raise taxes to pay debts in future but noted that the country's debt target does not exceed 50 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product.Rotich said Kenya cannot stop importation without having the means to produce."There&rsquo;s a benchmark that we are looking at when it comes to borrowing. We cannot say we want to produce matchsticks and toothpicks here when there&rsquo;s nobody to do it," he said."We might have borrowed more than previous governments but those governments haven&rsquo;t done what we have."
