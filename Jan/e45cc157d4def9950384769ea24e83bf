Davis &amp; Shirtliff has opened a branch in Ongata Rongai to help boost the community&rsquo;s agriculture and industrial sectors. The new office, the second in Kajiado county, has increased the firm&rsquo;s branches to 28 in the country. &ldquo;The company has introduced solar technology and solar-powered water solutions which are more reliable, require no maintenance, and are a cost-effective option in the long-term because they require zero running costs,&rdquo; Davis &amp; Shirtliff chief executive David Gatende said. Kajiado is fast becoming the food basket of Nairobi, replacing Kiambu whose agriculture lands are being converted into real estate. Its proximity to the capital has increased its access to new farming methods such as drip irrigation and greenhouses. Davis &amp; Shirtliff offers more than 5,000 products.
