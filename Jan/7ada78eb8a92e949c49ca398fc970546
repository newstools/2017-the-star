This is likely to foster anarchy and break established order in society," he added.He said the arsonists inconvenienced law abiding Kenyans and have kept them from being able to access policing services since the police post has been destroyed.Oketch said the authority has been very vocal in castigating the police for unprofessional conduct in push for police reforms and accountability.He said IPOA has successfully recommended prosecution of errant police officers to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions Keriako Tobiko, some of whom are already charged in court.The Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet has warned of tough action against anyone visiting violence on police officers and attacking police stations after a crime is committed. "It is incumbent of all Kenyans to obey the law as it is and to channel any grievances they may have using available legal avenues instead of taking the law into their hands,&rdquo; Boinnet said.
