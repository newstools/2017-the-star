Police in Mandera are yet to make any arrest after suspected al Shabaab militants hurled grenades in the town yesterday and killed one reservist.The daring attack was at the Equity Bank and the residence of Deputy Governor Omar Maalim.The attackers, whose number has not be established struck at around 3am, despite the dusk-to-dawn curfew that has been in place for four months. County commission Fredrick Shisia told the Star on the phone said the attackers used IEDs and grenades. Police reservists manning the CBD said they came into contact with the attackers as they tried to plant explosives at Equity Bank. &ldquo;Our officers on patrol bumped into the attackers as they tried to assemble an IED at the entrance of the bank,&rdquo; a reservist said. The rear part of the bank was destroyed. Sources said the militias were targeting some non-local casual labourers. When they realised they had been spotted, they escaped and hurled grenades as they run towards Jabane Hotel and Maalim&rsquo;s home, where they threw more explosives. The attack is the first within Mandera town after the curfew started in October last year following the killing of six people. In December, the government extended the curfew up to the end of March.
