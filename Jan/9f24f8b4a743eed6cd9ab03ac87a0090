Chama cha Uzalendo has urged Kenyans to ignore adverts appearing on the daily newspapers by its expelled chairman Maur Bwanamaka offering nominations for potential candidates.The party vice chairman Richard Onsongo described the adverts by Bwanamaka as plot to fleece innocent Kenyans since he is no longer the CCU chairman after he was relieved off his duties after he was involved in a corruption scandal.&ldquo;Bwanamaka, Anthony Mureithi, Titus Kaloki Kimuyu and Veronica Mativo are no longer CCU members and cannot transact any business on behalf of the party,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Together with his group, they have advertised nomination positions at a price. That is fraud. They want to steal from Kenyans just as they did to the party when they embezzled Sh1.9 million,&rdquo; Osongo said.Speaking at a media briefing in Diani, Kwale, Onsongo said Bwanamaka is already opening purported CCU offices in Coast illegally.In his response, Bwanamaka dismissed the claims and asked Onsongo and his team to go to court instead of making noise about him.
