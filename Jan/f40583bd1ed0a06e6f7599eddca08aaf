Legendary soccer star Joe Kadenge has prepared a minute-long video with wishes he would like fulfilled before his death. The 81-year old suffered a stroke in January 2006. Kadenge&nbsp; collapsed&nbsp; at Camp Toyoyo grounds in Jericho, Nairobi,&nbsp; while watching a football match on December 23. He was&nbsp;hospitalised with diabetes and high&nbsp;blood&nbsp;sugar level complications but is now recuperating at home in South B estate.&nbsp; A fund raiser for his treatment will be held at Railways club&nbsp;on&nbsp;Friday. The former AFC Leopards player and Kenyan striker&nbsp;has&nbsp; requested to meet the President, whom he has wished well and asked to steer the country to success. "There are people in the government that I would like to meet. First and foremost, President Uhuru Kenyatta, I would like to meet you before I die," he said."It seems my body doesn&rsquo;t like me anymore. I would also like to meet the retired Presidents. You remember the old men... I would like to see them."These are Daniel Moi and Mwai Kibaki. Kadenge said&nbsp;he would like to pay the three leaders his last respects before "God calls me", to say goodbye and ask them to grow Kenya.
