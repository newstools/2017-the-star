Governor Ahmed Abdullahi says he should be reelected because he has a strong development track record and works for Wajir&rsquo;s interests.No political broker has or will sway me do politics their way as I serve residents, he said on Friday.The mandate of choosing leaders belongs to the people and not a few disgruntled politicians, he said.&ldquo;I appeal to the people of this great county to remain peaceful in this electioneering period,&rdquo; Abdullahi said.He spoke in Wajir town where he was welcomed back from a three-week official visit to Saudi Arabia.Abdullahi accused his opponents of campaigning on tribal lines, rather than telling residents why they should vote for them. &ldquo;I am a candidate for the people of Wajir, regardless of tribe. I hope to step in all 400 locations to seek your votes,&rdquo; he said.Abdullahi said he sealed deals with Saudi Arabia, including exporting livestock products and growing date palms. Other deals involve water, health and farming.The Saudi government will plant 10,000 date seedlings and buy meat once an abattoir opens.
