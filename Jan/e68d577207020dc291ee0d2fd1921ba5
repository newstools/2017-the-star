Kenya Defence Force side, Ulinzi women&rsquo;s handball team, has been disbanded ahead of the 2017 Kenya Handball Federation national league set to start next month.KDF assistant secretary general, Sammy Mwangangi, confirmed the new development but was quick to note that the move was aimed at paving way for more teams attached to KDF to join the league. Mwangangi said at least five teams from the KDF among them Ulinzi women&rsquo;s side, Artillery Gunners, 2nd Brigade, Kenya Navy, Engineers and Kahawa have confirmed participation in the league. He said: &ldquo;There will be no longer a women&rsquo;s Ulinzi team but rather players who formed the team will turn up for their respective formations. But the good thing about disbanding the team is that those players who didn&rsquo;t get chance to play for the team because of numbers, will now have an opportunity at their respective formation.&rdquo;He continued: &ldquo;With the entrance of the five teams in the league, the number of female teams will increase and that will make the league more competitive . In the previous seasons, we have only seen champions Nairobi Water, Cereals Board and Ulinzi fight for the top spot.&rdquo;Ulinzi finished second behind Nairobi Water last season while NCPB settled for third position. At the same time, the official revealed that former national team player Nixon Oyaro has been appointed Ulinzi men&rsquo;s team coach and takes over from Obed Nyaga. Oyaro will be assisted by Haroun Mumbo and Emmanuel Mutiso.Mwangangi, who double up as the Ulinzi team manager, said the new changes were strategic to ensure the side defends the title they won last season and retain the East and Central Africa Club Championship.
