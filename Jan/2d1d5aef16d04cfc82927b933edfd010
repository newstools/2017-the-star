"Aren&rsquo;t those complaining the ones who were crying about the community being locked out of major appointments?"Politicians allied to Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang'ula's Ford-Kenya party have criticised the appointment of Chebukati and Wabukala saying the government is only looking for votes from the populous Bukusu sub-tribe.The Bukusu is the large Luhya sub-tribe and dominates in Trans Nzoia and Bungoma counties.Ford Kenya secretary general Eseli simiyu asked why the government waited until the electioneering period to appoint the two.&ldquo;You cannot neglect the community for four years and expect to hoodwink us in the last year to get votes,&rdquo; he said.Kabuchai MP James Lusweti told the star on phone: &ldquo;The appointments are personal and will not influence the community&rsquo;s decision."His sentiments were echoed by Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa and Wetang&rsquo;ula who said no amount of hoodwinking will cause them to change their position.Lusaka further noted that as leaders affiliated with President Uhuru Kenyatta's Jubilee Party, they have been pushing for appointments and infrastructure development.&ldquo;It is our role as leadership to push for our people to get what they deserve from the government under the sun. The politics of opposing everything only sends the community into oblivion," he said in Webuye on Wednesday.Read: We&rsquo;ll fight for Chebukati and Wabukala &ndash; MPAlso read: Khangati urges former ACK Archbishop Wabukala to reject EACC chairman job
