More than 5,000 children in Kerio Valley have not gone back to school, two weeks after schools countrywide resumed sessions, due to banditry attacks along the borders between West Pokot, Turkana, Elgeyo Marakwet and Baringo counties.Five hundred teachers are also yet to report to the 35 primary and secondary schools for fear of insecurity.Six people have been killed by bandits in the area, including a chief and a nurse, last week.Samwel Kosgey, from the Catholic Church&rsquo;s Peace and Justice Commission, says they are concerned with the high number of children who are not in school.He said they have initiated dialogue between affected communities to help restore peace and have schools resume full operations.&ldquo;A survey indicates that we have a very high number of children still out of schools. The main causes are either insecurity or famine,&rdquo; Kosgey said.MCAs in Baringo, led by Joseph Mukilap, said many families had fled their homes due to banditry and famine. &ldquo;The situation is worsening, with famine affecting more than 100,000 people across the Kerio Valley,&rdquo; he said.Turkana county leaders have urged the government to carry out a fresh security operation.
