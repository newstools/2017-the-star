The shilling was stable against the dollar on Monday but traders expected an uptick in demand from oil and retail goods importers that could put the local currency under depreciation pressure. At 10.07am, commercial banks quoted the shilling at 103.95/104.05 to the dollar, same level as Friday&rsquo;s close.The shilling has depreciated by about 2.12 per cent against the greenback since the election of Donald Trump as US president on November 8. His surprise election raised hopes of tax cuts. Foreign Exchange Reserves dropped 1.61 per cent to $6.94 billion (Sh720.93 billion) last week from $7.06 billion (Sh733.39 billion) a week earlier as the shilling came under pressure from the greenback. &ldquo;Whereas the Central Bank&rsquo;s foreign exchange reserves and import cover are relatively robust, at 4.6 months (against the prescribed 4.3 months), we anticipate general weakness of the local unit in Q1 and Q2 2017 ahead of the general election,&rdquo; StratLink analysts said last week.
