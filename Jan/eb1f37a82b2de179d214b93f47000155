Kenyans on social media have criticised President Uhuru for meeting with a Nigerian diplomat at State House Mombasa instead of meeting with doctors to end the countrywide strike. Uhuru posted on his Facebook account that he had met Kayode Fayemi, the Nigerian Special Envoy and Minister of Solid Minerals Development on Wednesday.The post drew mixed reactions as some asked the President to find ways of ending the doctor's strike, which is now entering its first month, while others supported Uhuru.Tom Gard told the President to "celebrate" but warned that things were "bad out here politically".Earlier, there was confusion about scheduled talks between Uhuru and the doctor's union as reports on social media indicated that the two parties were to meet.KMPDU secretary general Ouma Oluga said they were not aware of any such meeting because they had not received any official invitation.State House spokesman Manoah Esipisu also said he was not aware of the meeting.More on this: We are not aware of State House meeting to end strike, doctors sayAlso read: As doctors strike continues, KOT demand Uhuru help to stop deathsBut sources told the Star the meeting actually took place and began at around 10am.By 4pm, the meeting was still on, although Uhuru was seen leaving State House in a convoy of three cars heading towards the Mombasa port after posting about the meeting with the Nigerian diplomat.State House digital director Dennis Itumbi later posted on his Facebook page that Uhuru was in a meeting with doctors."The President is currently meeting the Doctor's Union together with Treasury CS Rotich, Health CS Mailu, Salaries boss Serem, PS Treasury Thugge and PS Health Muraguri," he said but did not provide pictures for the said meeting.[AUDIO] Ailing soccer star Joe Kadenge's dying wish: A meeting with Uhuru
