Learning came to a halt at a school in Naivasha as a group of students screamed and writhed in pain saying they were being strangled by spirits.Teachers at Ngondi Primary School and members of the public were shocked as the group was of female students only. Parents, who accused neighbours of bewitching their daughters for unknown reasons, had considered closing down the school of about 700 students. But religious leaders were called to pray for the girls following the incident on Tuesday.A similar case was reported at a school in Narok county last week where it was said students also collapsed.Samson Karimi, a parent at Ngondi, said tens of students had reported attacks by demons the previous day.&ldquo;We are worried. Despite calling the religious leaders to pray for the students, the problem is getting worse by the day,&rdquo; he said.Another parent named Ann Waithera said they did not have any idea of what could have caused the students to behave that way.But Waithera said the students claimed they were bewitched and were being attacked by "Coast spirits" that ordered them to scream and wriggle on the floor.&ldquo;For the last two days we have had sleepless nights due to this odd occurrence. We are calling on the government to consider closing the school for a week,&rdquo; she said.But assistant county commissioner Joseph Opondo was quick to rule this out saying it was not a solution.Opondo said the attacks resulted from hysteria and that the clerics' prayers had worked.&ldquo;It is true that on two different days the students have gone into hysteria claiming they were under attack by demons. This can be resolved through counseling and prayers," he said.Opondo asked parents to talk to their children saying this was the only solution.&ldquo;Some of the students could be copying their colleagues. We are working with religious leaders to help resolve this problem before it spreads to neighbouring schools,&rdquo; he said.
