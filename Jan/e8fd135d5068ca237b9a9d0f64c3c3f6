A Kibera court on Wednesday issued a warrant of arrest against a woman suspected to have impersonated a US Embassy agent and duped a businesswoman into giving her Sh203,000. Eunice Mayo Abuogo allegedly lied to the woman she could help her get a visa from the embassy. Abuogo did not appear in court as expected to take her plea and she did not send any legal representative to explain her reason for absconding. The prosecutor asked the court to issue a warrant of arrest against her for failing to appear. Police records allege that on various dates between September 23 and December 9 last year at Development House with an intent to defraud, she obtained the sum from Alice Ndung&rsquo;u by purporting to be a US Embassy agent. The records show she also made a referral letter for Odd Mec Enterprises purporting it was issued to Ndung&rsquo;u by the company. The case will be mentioned on February 23.
