A family in Miondoni, Mwala, is mourning the death of their 11-year-old son who died from a snake bite. The boy&rsquo;s mother Debora Mumbua told the Star yesterday they spent three days moving from one hospital to another, seeking help as services in public health facilities have been disrupted by the ongoing doctors&rsquo; strike.
