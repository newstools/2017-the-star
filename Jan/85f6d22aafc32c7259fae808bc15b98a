All adults in Murang'a county should register to vote in the registration that begins on January 16, a businessman has said.Kigumo MP aspirant Joseph Munyoro urged residents to register so they have bargaining power in the August 8 general election."The IEBC will kick off voter registration from January 16 for the next 30 days and it is just fair for us all to register as voters because those are the tools we will use to ensure our region gets a share of the national cake rightfully," he said."The coming elections will be very tough as only votes will be the best weapons in choosing the right leaders."The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission last week announced that it would start registration of voters from January 16 for 30 days. Some 7,846 biometric voter registration kits will be disbursed to counties, 53 of which will be at various Huduma centres to speed up the registration.The commission has also advertised 1,775 voter registration assistants and 15,692 clerks jobs to assist with voter registration.The IEBC will further conduct a 15-day diaspora registration between February 1 and 17.The businessman urged incumbents to restrain from campaigning for or endorsing any aspirant to ensure sober decisions by the voters."The nation is past endorsements or inheritance of political seats," he said.
