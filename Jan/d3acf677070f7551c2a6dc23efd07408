Rutto said, &ldquo;I am not opposed to projects by the national government in the county or anywhere else in the country because they help Kenyans. But it is unfortunate the DP invited leaders and residents from here for Christmas and New Year celebrations to criticise me.&rdquo;During the party last week, Ruto said Rutto has always been a stumbling block during the implementation of key projects.
