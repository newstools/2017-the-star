Two Jubilee senators have asked Cord to stop issuing threats of war to Kenyans whenever they are defeated.Addressing a press conference at Parliament Buildings on Friday, Senate majority leader Kithure Kindiki and his deputy Kipchumba Murkomen said Cord should stop intimidating Kenyans.&ldquo;We want to call on our competitors to stop threatening the country whenever their agenda has failed. The opposition, in particular, should learn to respect and honour our nation and stop fear mongering,&rdquo; Kindiki said.He added, &ldquo;Time has come for us to condemn any attempts by the opposition to disrupt peace.&rdquo;Kindiki urged Cord to use the right channels and public institutions to challenge the decision of the Senate on election laws, adding that the opposition should not intimidate speaker Ekwee Ethuro.He said Cord should be &ldquo;gracious to defeat&rdquo;, adding that the contentious Election Laws (Amendments) Bill passed on Thursday night is now for all Kenyans.&ldquo;We understand why Cord is unhappy with the results - they did not get the numbers. For those unhappy, there is a legal and democratic way of expressing it. Laws can always be revisited, it is not an end in itself,&rdquo; Kindiki said.Murkomen on his part said there is &ldquo;no substitute for democracy so far&rdquo;, saying the opposition has become hopeless in its attempts to discredit Jubilee&rsquo;s development agenda.Murkomen also took issue with Senate minority leader Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula, accusing him of disparaging young senators who hold contrary opinion to his.&ldquo;The attitude and language he has against young senators is wanting, shameful and unacceptable for a man who wants to become the President of Kenya,&rdquo; he said.
