Amos Mathu, a 37-year old father of two, working as a chef in Mombasa, has bagged Ksh900,000 from placing a Sh10 multiple bet on nine different basketball games.Mathu is a basketball enthusiast, who placed his bet on the Betway sports betting platform over the weekend. He says his excitement reached its highest level when he sat down to watch the last game in his bet between Utah Jazz Vs Oklahoma.&ldquo;At one point, both teams were tied at 90-90 and I thought my bet was lost. So I decided to stop watching the game and went home, believing that my luck had failed. Later, I checked the results of the game and I could not believe that my team Oklahoma had won, making me a winner. I said a short prayer, thanking God before checking my winnings, and I did a test by withdrawing Sh49,999 to make sure my win was real and not a dream,&rdquo; said Mathu.Mathu, who hails from Maragwa in Muranga County and has worked at the Safari Bar and Restaurant for 12 years, said he plans to use a portion of the money to connect his mother&rsquo;s house with electricity. He also plans to pay school fees for his first born son and to put a percentage of the funds into his business, rearing and selling chickens, as well as selling bed covers in Mombasa. Commenting on Mathu&rsquo;s winnings, Betway country manager Wanja Gikonyo said, &ldquo;Our platform offers an opportunity for everyone to win large amounts on a variety of games &mdash;not only in Jackpot.&rdquo;
