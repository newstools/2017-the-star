Veteran artiste Nameless is no doubt one of the biggest and most prominent singers in the Kenyan music industry, having been in the game for more than a decade.Nameless aka David Mathenge is known for his amazing and lively songs from back in the day like; Mega Rider, Butterfly, Sinzia, Salari, Sunshine, Karibia, Coming Home, African Beauty, and many others.Away from music and all the hustle, the super talented lad is married to the lovely Wahu Kagwi and they have been blessed with two adorable daughters, the first born Tumiso and the little cute one, Nyakio Mathenge.The lovely couple has been together for more than 16 years and in September 2016, they celebrated their 11th wedding anniversary despite unconfirmed rumors of a breakup back in 2015.Honestly, you have to give mad respect to Wahu and Nameless for being one of Kenya's power couple who have managed to maintain a long-lasting marriage, despite constant scrutiny because of their careers.During a recent interview with a local radio station, Nameless revealed that his wife Wahu rarely keeps time when they are going to an event or going out of the house, as there's always something that derails her.He admitted that he's resorted to lying about what time they're required to attend an event so that they don't get late.Other than that Nameless also revealed to Citizen that he wants another child and this time, a boy, saying that he will do anything and use any method necessary to make sure the next baby is a boy.All the best to them when they decide to have a third child.
