Address the grievances raised by the opposition on behalf of Kenyans instead of engaging in character assassination, ANC leaders have told the President.National chairman Kelvin Lunani and organising secretary Basil Mwakiringo said President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s attack on Musalia Mudavadi was a clear sign of panic in Jubilee over his position in the opposition.&ldquo;Uhuru is stooping too low and in panic compares his performance as President to the work of former ministers. This shows how he seriously lacks appreciation of his office,&rdquo; Lunani said. They issued a statement yesterday.Lunani said Uhuru has failed the country and he is deceitful in his dealings with Kenyans. &ldquo;Uhuru has reneged on the electoral laws amendments agreed on between them and Cord. He did the same to teachers and now has disowned the CBA with doctors,&rdquo; he said. Mudavadi is credited with tackling the multibillion-shilling Goldenberg scandal and establishing the Kenya Revenue Authority to safeguard tax collection, the two said.He was part of the mediation team that worked with former UN secretary general Kofi Annan to end the stalemate after the bungled December 27, 2007, general election. The talks led to the formation of the Grand Coalition Government headed by Prime Minister Raila Odinga and President Mwai Kibaki.On Friday at the launch of the JP membership card Uhuru said the opposition is made up of people who cannot show what they did while in government. &ldquo;The insult is directed more at former Presidents Moi and Kibaki, under whom Musalia served, because it is inconceivable they appointed him to serve in Cabinet repeatedly and for so long if he was a non-performer,&rdquo; he said.
