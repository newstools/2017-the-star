Some Jubilee leaders in Nairobi have demanded that the party uses universal suffrage in deciding who will fly its flag in the race for governor.Senator Mike Sonko, MPs Dennis Waweru (Dagoretti South), Johnson Sakaja (Nominated) and former Starehe MP Margaret Wanjiru said they will reject "boardroom candidates".There has been word that the Jubilee team will opt for negotiations to arrive at the most suitable candidate to vie against ODM Governor Evans Kidero.The group, which was joined by MPs Alfred Keter (Nandi Hills) and Oscar Sudi (Kapseret) for a rally in Githurai on Tuesday, also rejected former presidential candidate Peter Kenneth's bid.Sonko said Kenneth is not only a latecomer, but he also has not dissolved his Kenya National Congress party, like others affiliated to Jubilee."We don't want him in Jubilee. He was given money by foreigners to campaign against President Uhuru Kenyatta. He wanted Uhuru to go to the Hague and be jailed," he said.Sonko said Kenneth is the one pushing for consensus, "yet he does not understand city politics"."Do not accept people coming from elsewhere. We do not want them. Don't be fooled," the senator said.Sakaja said Kidero must be defeated at all cost. He urged women to deny their husbands conjugal rights if they do not register as voters.Keter and Sudi urged the residents to vote for Uhuru and Ruto.Former Kamukunji MP Simon Mbugua said Kenneth's entry into Jubilee will complicate Uhuru's political arithmetic."Kalenjins have read mischief in this. They feel he is being prepared to take over from Uhuru in 2022," he said."If he is not up to anything sinister, let him stay with KNC because he and Martha Karua said they do not have time for the President."The leaders asked residents to register in large numbers and ensure they re-elect Uhuru and Deputy President William Ruto.
