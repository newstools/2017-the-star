Muhoroni Youth have been ordered to compensate striker Wycliffe Ochomo for irregular suspension.Kenya Premier League&rsquo;s Independent Disciplinary and Complaints Committee has ruled that the suspension slapped on Ochomo was irregular and breach of contract signed between the club and the player and thus ordered the sugar millers to pay the player Sh112,000.&ldquo;IDCC has ruled that Muhoroni Sugar&rsquo;s suspension of Wycliffe Ochomo was irregular and in breach of the contract signed between club and player,&rdquo; said a statement posted on KPl website in part.&ldquo;IDCC has consequently judged that Ochomo was entitled to terminate his contract with Muhoroni &lsquo;for just cause&rdquo;.In its ruling released yesterday, the disciplinary body has ordered Muhoroni Youth to pay Ochomo Sh112, 000 in salaries owed to him for the months of September to December 2016 during which time he was under indefinite suspension without salary.&ldquo;Muhoroni suspended the player citing breach of contract last season. IDCC has also ordered Muhoroni to issue Ochomo with his release letter within the next seven days.&rdquo;Elsewhere, Muhoroni Youth chairman Moses Adagala says the sugar millers are preparing for new season and that they are in the top flight to stay.Adagala once again hit out at Football Kenya Federation over decision to relegate Thika United, Sofapaka and Muhoroni.Two weeks ago, FKF announced that the three clubs will not take part in top flight league after failing to comply with club licensing rules. Adagala said his club is preparing for the new season like other teams and that they are in KPL to stay.&ldquo;We are all aware that KPL is a private company and it is not run by FKF, so who gave the federation powers to relegate teams? As a matter of fact, Muhoroni are in the league to stay. We will comply with the club licensing but about relegation we are surprised,&rdquo; Adagala said.&ldquo;We have even received our monthly grant from KPL and I am laughing when I hear someone saying we are relegated. There are clear guidelines about relegation and demotion and rules should be applied in a proper manner.
