Several houses were torched in Marakwet East on Monday at dawn following fierce inter-clan clashes sparked by the killing of a woman.Fighting between Kowow and their neighbours at Maron sub-location erupted after residents discovered the body of Talaa Lomuket, 62.The woman is believed to have been killed during an attack on Sunday evening, but security officials in the area refuted the claims.Area deputy county commissioner Eric Mulevu said they are yet to establish the cause of the woman's death as well as the number of houses razed during the retaliatory attacks."We suspect the woman fell from a rock while on her way to a relative&rsquo;s house in Maron," Mulevu said.The body was taken to Kapsowar Mission hospital for postmortem."We are yet to establish the number of houses that were destroyed. Police officers have been deployed in the area to restore calm," he said.He said that members of the Kowow clan suspect that the woman was murdered and her body dumped in the village.Mulevu blamed the attack on Marakwet culture that allows destruction of property to revenge suspected murder.He warned the attackers, suspected to be from Kowow clan, against opening fire at police officers.Read: Do not agitate killer Pokot bandits, Baringo residents now toldAlso read: We&rsquo;ll use force to end clashes, Marakwet East residents told The attack happened barely a day after one person was shot dead by suspected Pokot bandits at Kerio Valley as fights over pasture intensified.The heavily armed bandits raided Lukuget area on Saturday night and fought with Marakwet herders who were guarding cows.Acting area police boss Anthony Muriuki said a fierce gun battle ensued after the raiders attempted to steal some 500 cattle from the Marakwet herders.Muriuki said Stephen Kipchumba, 22, died on the spot after he was shot on the neck during the attack, most of which he said are executed at night.He said the bandits have changed tact following intensified patrols by security agencies and local herders."The situation on the ground has been normalised.
