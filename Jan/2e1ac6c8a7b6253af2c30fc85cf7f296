Two women were lynched in Nyamira Saturday evening on suspicion that they were witches.The lynch mob also torched five houses belonging to other suspected witches in an incident that left Gekonge village residents and the police bewildered.Pauline Marinda Mogambi, 95 and her daughter Mary Mogambi 40, were rounded up and set on fire at around 4pm.The daughter had come from her matrimonial home to assist her mother harvest some maize, only to meet her death.Villagers said trouble started Friday night when a book was found in the village bearing the list of witches, the people they have killed in recent days and those targeted.&ldquo;The book had names of some people who have already died. It also had names of people targeted to be killed by the witches, the day and the reason they would be killed,&rdquo; a villager who was unwilling to say his name said.The attackers were moving using motorbikes and used petrol and dry leaves to burn the two women and torch the houses.Nyamira South police chief Rico Ngare confirmed that the two women were burnt by unknown people on suspicion of witchcraft.&ldquo;It is alleged that a book was found yesterday (Friday) bearing the names of people who have allegedly been killed by the witches. The book also had names of others who were scheduled to die on particular dates and this is what instigated the attack,&rdquo; Ngare said.However, unconfirmed reports indicated that prior to the attack, some people from the village who were privy of the incident went to Nyamira Police Station and made a report.The goons who appeared well coordinated engaged police in running battles, before they were finally overwhelmed.At least five riders vanished and abandoned their motorbikes behind after police fired in their air to contain the situation.Ngare condemned the incident and vowed to conduct through investigations to get to the bottom of the incident.&ldquo;This incident is shameful and regrettable and we will crack down on the attackers. It is against the law to take one&rsquo;s life and nobody will be left spared,&rdquo; he said.Incidents of elderly men and women getting lynched are not new in the county and authorities link them to domestic differences including land inheritance and boundary disputes.Bomabacho sub-location assistant chief Samuel Kinaro asked residents not to revenge as this could cause further loss of lives and property.After the situation was contained, police removed the charred bodies from the scene and took them to Nyamira County Referral Hospital Mortuary.
