Kajiado Central MP Elijah Memusi has opposed Wafula Chebukati's nomination as IEBC chairman, his integrity was not questioned.Memusi said Chebukati will fail to deliver credible elections on August 8."The position of the chairperson is very important," he said, adding Chebukati should not be allowed to take it."This house should not be blackmailed over the time frame of the elections. I followed the interviews keenly and if I were to score, Chebukati would come second."The MP told his colleagues during their debate on Tuesday that he did not have confidence in the nominee."A petitioner who was not captured by the Legal committee touched on Chebukati's integrity. Everything about him is questionable," he said.Read: Chebukati, Nkatha integrity questions not raised during vetting, says IEBC panelBut Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa opposed Memusi utterances saying the nominee should be given an opportunity to manage the election.Wamalwa said Chebukati can deliver a free, fair and credible election."He is a soft person but people who are soft cannot be taken for granted.

He should be the chair so that we don't talk about stolen elections because he is part of the opposition," he said.Abdul said all nominees to the IEBC were qualified and that there was no reason to oppose them."We have to trust them," he said.The Justice and Legal Affairs Committee earlier endorsed Chebukati saying he had had the requisite qualifications and experience.The committee also endorsed six nominees to the IEBC, as approved by President Uhuru Kenyatta.The six were Consolata Bucha, Boya Molu, Roselyn Akombe, Paul Kurgat, Margaret Mwachanya and Abdi Guliye.Read: IEBC selection panel receives huge list of 778 applications
