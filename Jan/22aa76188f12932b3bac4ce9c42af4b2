The government will take stern action against those perpetrating violence, spokesman Eric Kiraithe has said.Kiraithe on Tuesday said the violence being witnessed in the run up to the elections is both criminal and an affront to the constitution of the country."Everyone has a right to freely support and join any political party without intimidation.It is alarming when the person involved is the Deputy President. This needs to be condemned in strongest possible terms," he said.On Monday, the DP was forced to abandon avenue he had chosen after rowdy youth blocked the road.Addressing the press at Kenyatta International Convention Centre, Kiraithe said security agencies will identify the perpetrators before taking them to court as the escalating violence "is setting stage for a precarious situation once main campaign sets in"."We urge those who were affected to file the complaints to facilitate investigations.The media can also assist in quick identification as evidence act allows," he said.Kiraithe said once cases are taken to court, they will be expeditiously handled because violence was setting mood for the elections.On claims by Cord leader that the ruling coalition was using national intelligence service to register voters and give Jubilleean upperhand,Kiraithe said IEBC was better placed to respond."The government is determined to have an independnet IEBC," he said.When confronted on why the government was giving a lot of attention to elections at the expense of other pressing issues, Kiraithe said issues such as doctors strike, the ravaging drought had adequately been addressed."Both the county and national governments have plans as there is an intergovernmental team that had been formed to look into drought situation."On the doctors strike, which is on its 50th day, Kiraithe accused the doctors for being insincere."The government has given them an increment but they rejected. Court has told them that the strike is illegal but they went an extra mile disobeying, if I were the judge,they should be in jail now," he said adding that the courts were independent.Kiraithe said doctors making political stunts accusing its leadership for the current stand off.He said doctors salary had been compared with those of other countries such as COMESA, third world countries, and the purchasing power of Kenyan shilling.
