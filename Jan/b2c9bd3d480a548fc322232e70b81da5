The government will double relief food for Marsabit county to mitigate the effects of the drought ravaging the county, President Uhuru Kenyatta has said. Addressing Marsabit residents who turned out in large numbers to receive him yesterday, he said the government is reviewing its budget to allocate more funds for food to assist those affected by drought.Uhuru said his administration is also looking for Sh1 billion for the completion of Badasa Dam, which will increase water supply in the county. The President said the government will not tolerate shoddy contractors, like the one who delayed the completion of the dam.&ldquo;We will blacklist contractors who do not deliver value for taxpayers&rsquo; money,&rdquo; he said. Early this week, Devolution Cabinet Secretary Mwangi Kiunjuri flagged off distribution of 420 tonnes of relief food in Marsabit. He assured residents that the President&rsquo;s directive that the food be ferried straight to divisions to reach the beneficiaries on time will strictly be adhered to. Uhuru, who visited an Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission centre in Marsabit town to assess the progress of voter registration, urged residents to enlist in large numbers and determine the future of their county through voting.
