Reigning national champions United States International University must play a game of their lives tomorrow at Nyayo Stadium gymnasium lest they relinquish their title to Equity Bank.The bankers last week pushed the reigning champions closer to elimination by taking a 2-0 semi-finals lead in the best of five series. A win for the &lsquo;Hawks&rsquo; will take them to their first ever finals. Equity won Game One 51-40 and closed in with a 63-52 victory in Game Two a day later. They only need to win one of the three ties to sail through. The winners tackle Kenya Ports Authority in the final. Mercy Wanyama, Samba Mjomba, Hilda Indasi, Linda Mfuchi, Susan Akinyi, Everlyne Nora and Shialei Sani have all it takes to guide Equity through especially now that the students will be missing the services of Sarah Chan. Cynthia, Irankunda, Melissa Akinyi and Merab Odhiambo are USIU&rsquo;s hope for progress but even them know that it is a tall order.In the men&rsquo;s lower division match up at the same venue, Umoja meet Zetech University while Nebulus of Kakamega will be in Nairobi to face another Zetch University side. In the women&rsquo;s match, Zetech University start favourites against Strathmore University after taking a commanding 2-0 advantage. They won both games 55-46 and 41-36.
