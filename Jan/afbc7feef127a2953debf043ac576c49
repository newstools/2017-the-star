Starbucks Corp Chief Executive Officer Howard Schultz plans to hire 10,000 refugees over five years in 75 countries, days after U.S. President Donald Trump's executive order banning refugees from certain countries. Trump on Friday put a four-month hold on allowing refugees into the United States and temporarily barred travelers from Syria and six other Muslim-majority countries, saying the moves would help protect Americans from terrorist attacks. The order sparked widespread international criticism, outrage from civil rights activists and legal challenges. Starbucks in a letter from Schultz told employees it would do everything possible to support affected workers.
