Remember Queen Darleen, a Tanzanian female artist who was introduced to the game by Ali Kiba? Lets say she betrayed Kiba after he put her in the lime light because she is now signed under Diamond Platnumz's music label, WCB.Well, this Tanzanian songstress who now has few weeks in the label has revealed the rules that come with working with Diamond. Queen Darleen has said that she and other artists working with Diamond's label are not supposed to walk around in public or in the streets for everyone to see them."Sisi descpline yetu hatutakiwi kutoka kwenye mastarehe hatutakiwi kuzurura ovyo muda wote tupo ofisi, sisi tuna hamu ya kuruka muziki."You might remember the song, Wajua, which Darleen featured Diamond's rival Ali Kiba that got her recognition in the music industry... she however did not perform that hit song during the Wasafi beach party which was during Christmas Eve, 2016. It is obvious thatIt is pretty strange considering that Wajua is the hit song that made this Tanzanian Queen get a massive following.Darleen however refused claims that it was because of her new music label that she did not perform her song with Ali Kiba. She cited that her management had planned for her to perform only 3 songs.Darleen now has a hit song with Rayvanny dubbed Kijuso which is making headlines in the bongo industry.This is what she said about said about her song with Ali Kiba;"Sitaweza kuperform kwa sababu pale nimepangiwa nyimbo tatu tu ambazo nitaimba nyimbo mbili za zamani alafu na hii moja mpya...Ile haikutakiwa kuwekwa kwa sababu ni nyimbo ambayo iko slow... Mi naenda kutokana na kisasa...Si kwamba kwasababu niko WCB...Natakiwa niende nilivyopangiwa...Mimi nimepangiwa."
