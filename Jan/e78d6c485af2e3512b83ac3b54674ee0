As the incoming US President and his men recently reminded us, Africa is famous globally as the continent of dictators and corruption. But events in West Africa are shaping up to help demolish that generalisation.First, one of Africa's iconic dictators, Yahya Jammeh, who rose to power through a military coup, and proceeded to rule with an iron fist, was voted out in a peaceful and democratic election.Second is that when - after initially conceding defeat - His Excellency decided that he actually wanted to keep the job he had held for 22 years already, a little longer, neighbouring countries set to work to persuade him to go away quietly. But even more significant, they set up a multinational armed force to go in and eject the dictator if he should refuse to leave.Meantime, the man who won the Gambian presidential election, Adama Barrow, has been sworn in as president in neighbouring Senegal, and has been recognised as the new president by the international community.This is an impressive precedent on a continent where "non-interference in the affairs of neighbouring countries" has long been the standard operating principle. And it is a giant step forward for African democracy.
