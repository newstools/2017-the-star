The tribunal that investigated former Supreme Court judge Philip Tunoi could not recommend any action over the Sh200 million alleged bribe.Journalist Geoffrey Kiplagat had alleged that Tunoi received a Sh200 million bribe from Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero to influence an election petition against him that was filed by Kabete MP Ferdinand Waititu.Waititu lost to Kidero in the March 4, 2013, general election and filed a petition.The tribunal chaired by Sharad Rao told President Uhuru Kenyatta in a confidential report that it could not make a binding recommendation for the removal or otherwise of the retired Supreme Court judge.&ldquo;The tribunal, decided to end the proceedings before it when Justice Tunoi was retired as a judge of the Supreme Court. In the circumstances, the tribunal is unable to make any definite findings in the matter having not had the opportunity to hear all the evidence that was to be adduced before it,&rdquo; the report states.The tribunal concludes the report with a request to the President that he makes the report public as soon as it is convenient &ldquo;due to the great public interest that the investigation generated&rdquo;.The tribunal was appointed on February 23 last year, following a petition prepared by the Judicial Service Commission and sent to Uhuru on February 6.It held a pre-trial status conference on March 31 and its first hearing on April 6. It wound up on June 27, following the June 16 ruling by the Supreme Court that Justice Tunoi had retired.JSC probe started on wrong footThe tribunal brought out issues against the Judicial Service Commission in the manner in which it handled the petition against Tunoi prior to recommending to the President that he forms a tribunal.&ldquo;The wrongful reliance on the NIS letter, which was not on the NIS letterhead and was not signed, was also unfortunate, but did not in our view invalidate the recommendation to the President for removal of the judge,&rdquo; the tribunal said in its report.The report also showed that the tribunal noted that it was unfortunate that a professional body such as the JSC failed to clearly specify under what limb of Article 168 it had acted to make the recommendation.The report says that the law needs to be amended to cure an anomaly that arises from Article 168, where it is not clear whether the JSC has the power to formulate or rewrite a petition brought by an individual or whether they are bound to present the petition to the President as happened in the Tunoi case.The tribunal noted a lack of clarity not only on procedure but also about the person or persons mandated to conduct the investigations for or on behalf of the JSC.The report also raises concerns over the creation of the office of the Judiciary Ombudsman to investigate judicial staff, including judges, while this is the mandate of the JSC.&ldquo;The Tribunal also noted that personnel serving both the JSC and Judiciary are at times not able to distinguish the different functions of the two distinct institutions,&rdquo; the report says.It adds that the Judiciary Chief Registrar at times signed letters to the tribunal as Secretary of JSC on Judiciary letterheads.The report shows that evidence adduced before the tribunal before it wound up indicates that Tunoi never initiated any form of communication with Kiplagat.Timelines do not tallyThe data evidence shows that it was not conclusive that the alleged meeting at Petro Petrol Station took place, where the Sh200 million bribe allegedly changed hands, it says.According to the data analysis evidence presented to the tribunal, Justice Tunoi was within St Ellis in the CBD and Kileleshwa between 7pm and 9pm.Governor Kidero, the evidence showed, was within North Muthaiga Estate at the time the alleged bribe was taking place.Evidence also showed that Kiprop Chirchir was within Daphton Court in Kilimani at 7pm and within Woodley Estate around 9.30 pm. He had been accused of being with Kidero when the bribe was allegedly given.&ldquo;Without benefit of further evidence there is no conclusive evidence of the presence of the persons mentioned being at the Petro Petrol station on the night of August 27, 2014, where the exchange of the bribe money is alleged to have taken place,&rdquo; the report says.The tribunal notes that the alleged meeting at Petro Petrol Station, which was reenacted at the scene, remains in doubt as Kiplagat contradicted himself several times over the issue.Chapter V of the report deals with analysis of evidence and this is where the tribunal indicates that though there was some communication between Justice Tunoi and Kiplagat, the judge did not initiate it.It also says that the evidence on call data shows that there was no voice call recorded between Tunoi and Kiplagat as the latter had alleged in his affidavit.Call data presented to the tribunal by Inspector Monica Githaiga show that Kiplagat initiated communication with Justice Tunoi through a text message on three difference occasions on May 21, 2014.&ldquo;Justice Tunoi did not respond to any of them,&rdquo; the report says.It adds that Kiplagat sent the messages to a number that was confirmed to be registered in the name of Tony Tunoi, the judge&rsquo;s son.&ldquo;Notably, this data doe not give information about the alleged voice calls,&rdquo; the report states.
