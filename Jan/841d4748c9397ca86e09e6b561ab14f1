Former TNA secretary general Onyango Oloo has been told to remain calm and not fear the state&rsquo;s &ldquo;empty&rdquo; threats to arrest him for alleged corruption.On Saturday, Siaya Senator James Orengo and Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo said they will not allow Jubilee to witch hunt Oloo, who was present.Midiwo said, &ldquo;How can Jubilee have the audacity to issue arrest threats over corruption allegations when it has been riddled by corruption scams?&rdquo;Orengo said, &ldquo;No Jubilee member is free of corruption scandals. Oloo should not be scared by the Jubilee brigade&rsquo;s remarks as they hold no water whatsoever.&rdquo; They spoke during Midiwo&rsquo;s sister-in-law&rsquo;s burial in Gem constituency. Last week, Devolution CS Mwangi Kiunjuri said the state has a dossier on Oloo showing corrupt dealings when he was at the helm of TNA.He said Oloo defected to ODM to run away from his offences. Orengo accused Jubilee of trying to &ldquo;divert attention from graft scams in the government&rdquo;. He welcomed Oloo to ODM and called for unity in NASA to kick Jubilee out of power. Midiwo assured Oloo he can depend on Cord members to stand by him if the state arrests him.&ldquo;Jubilee is fond of misusing the police to intimidate the opposition, but we are always prepared for them,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;What intentions does the government have by buying military tankers for policemen? If they think they can intimidate the opposition they should know we are not scared.&rdquo;Midiwo said Cord will not accept a rigged election. &ldquo;If Deputy President William Ruto can be chased away from Narok town, where will Jubilee get the numbers to beat Cord unless they mess around with the voters register? There will be no election if the register is not cleaned,&rdquo; he said.
