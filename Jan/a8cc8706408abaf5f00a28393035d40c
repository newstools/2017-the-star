Kisumu MCAs have gone on a Sh15 million retreat in Arusha, Tanzania, for what they termed a &lsquo;bonding session&rsquo;.This comes as other elected leaders and aspirants in the Nyanza region are participating in voter mobilisation.According to a source at the county assembly who sought anonymity, the retreat was organised by speaker Ann Adul and seconded by executive Ben Opiyo.The source said the 49 MCAs will pocket about Sh260,000 each after the seven-day retreat that began on Sunday&ldquo;The MCAs have had bad blood with the speaker and did not agree with the secondment of Opiyo to the assembly, so the retreat is a way of bribing them to accept them,&rdquo; the source said.Residents have questioned whether the trip was approved by the Devolution ministry.&ldquo;As Cord leader Raila Odinga is crisscrossing the county mobilising people to register as voters, they are busy enjoying themselves in Arusha,&rdquo; one resident said.He questioned how such retreats help residents.&ldquo;Nothing comes out of these retreats most of the time, so why go for them,&rdquo; he said.
