Lifestyle clothing retailer Deacons East Africa has joined the growing list of listed firms which expect net profit for 2016 to fall by at least a quarter year-on-year. Deacons blamed the reduced earnings on delays in opening new stores at two major shopping malls and a drop in sales during the Christmas festivities. Deacons joins Sanlam Kenya, self-listing NSE, Sameer Africa and Sasini in warning investors of lower net corporate earnings in 2016 compared with 2015. Family Bank, whose shares trade on Over-The-Counter market, has also issued a profit warning on one-off costs for the implementation of its retrenchment programme. About 18 firms reported reduced net income for the 2015 financial year, a development that cut government revenues by 6.9 per cent. The delays affected the opening of Adidas, Hong Kong-owned Bossini and UK&rsquo;s Tesco fashion brand line F&amp;F stores through franchise deals at the Hub Shopping Mall in Karen, the firm said in a note to investors yesterday through the NSE. The postponement of the opening of the Centum Investments-controlled Two Rivers Mall to next month from the initial target of September, Deacons said, also hit its projected earnings. &ldquo;This announcement is based on the unaudited financial statements of the company for the period ended September 30, 2016,&rdquo; company secretary John Manga said in the statement. Sameer notified investors on September 1 that its Sh15.65 million full-year net loss for 2015 will deepen by more than 25 per cent, citing a Sh725 million one-off retrenchment cost following the closure of its tyre factory.NSE on November 22 announced bear run on the bourse would cut its Sh305.59 million net profit in 2015 by more than a quarter.Sanlam on December 30 announced it expects the same results for the third year in a row on mark-to-market fair value losses on investments in equities and government securities. Sasini on December 16 said net earnings for the financial year to September 30, 2016, will be 25 per cent lower than Sh1.1 billion in 2015 on Sh1 billion one-off gain from the sale of 513.7 acres in Nyeri.
