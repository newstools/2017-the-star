Kanu secretary general Nick Salat has dismissed members opposed to the party working with the National Super Alliance.Calling the group "busybody politicians", Salat said he represented the party in his capacity as the SG and that his boss Gideon Moi (Baringo Senator) was aware."[Gideon] understands our relationship with other opposition parties," he said.Salat said he will table a report on the party's engagement with NASA, at the national delegates congress in April, as required by the Kanu constitution.The former Bomet MP said Kanu will continue working with other political parties to push the public's agenda ahead of the August 8 general election.Salat said Kanu was keen on defending and pushing for the interests of Kenyans but asked those aggrieved to channel their complaints correctly."In Kanu, it is not about specific people's interests but what Kenyans want," he said, adding he will continue working with those championing national interests."A party is a constituency on its own. We should capitalise on opportunities available to reach out to all stakeholders and push the agenda of Kenyans," he said in a telephone interview with the Star on Thursday."We want good leadership and unity. If we have a candidate then we will definitely support him or her. If we don&rsquo;t have one, we are allowed to exploit the opportunities available for the party."Nakuru leaders displeasedKanu leaders in Nakuru threatened to remove Salat from office following his involvement with the NASA team.The group asked the SG to clarify his involvement with the super alliance, saying they would mobilise other branches for his removal if he did not.Branch chairman John Muthee said the secretary general offended them by declaring that the party supports the opposition outfit without consulting them.The group said they want Salat punished for taking part in the May 2016's anti-IEBC rallies, parallel Madaraka Day celebrations and now the Bomas of Kenya meeting.At Bomas on Wednesday, Salat said the independence party will work with NASA in its onslaught against President Uhuru Kenyatta's Jubilee Party."Salat's decision to the join the NASA team was personal. Kanu delegates did not attend the meeting and the National Delegates Congress was not consulted," Muthee said.He noted that Gideon, their chairman, told them only delegates will make the decision on whom to support.Muthee said Salat had seven days to tell them whether his announcement resulted from a personal or collective decision.But he note the secretary general did not represent them.Moments after the Bomas meeting, National Executive Council member Ziporah Kittony dismissed Salat's assertions as "personal".She said his statement did not reflect the party's position on which political outfit it will join hands with ahead of the poll.Read: Kanu leaders split on NASA move as Kittony dismisses Salat 'personal' statementAlso read: Kanu Rift Valley branches back Nick Salat after NASA's Bomas meeting The sentiments come against the backdrop of a split among the independence party leaders over which political group to back in the vote.Salat has on many occasions appeared to be associating with Cord leaders, while chairman Gideon is yet to give political direction to the party members.Gideon has declared he will support Uhuru if he stops engaging DP William Ruto in reaching out to Kalenjins.Ruto and the Senator exchanged words before the President during the funeral of former Nominated MP Mark Too on Monday.After the Kapseret spat, Kericho Kanu officials backed Gideon's calls for Uhuru to engage the Kalenjin community directly instead of involving Ruto.Read: Carry Ruto on your back like your father was carried, Duale tells Gideon MoiAlso read: Kanu might back Jubilee as Gideon sends mixed signals
