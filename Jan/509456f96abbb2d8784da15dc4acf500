He should be reminded that his last work station fell under my ministry," the CS said without giving details on the allegations."He knows the mess he created," he further told the media on Thursday. "Oloo knows for sure that after the investigations, he might be a candidate... He might belong to jail."Kiunjuri said Oloo will be questioned next week. "He might get protection for where he has defected to but we will find him," he said.Oloo played a key role in Uhuru's presidential campaign in 2013, but former minister Raphael Tuju is the one now in charge of the Jubilee Party Secretariat.Kiunjuri noted on Wednesday that many allegations had been raised against the former secretary general.He said Oloo may have resorted to switching camps so that when he is prosecuted "he will resort to the tribal tag of defending himself", he said.Read: Onyango Oloo ditches Jubilee for ODM, merger intricacies resurfaceAlso read: Kiunjuri is gun for hire who knows no politics - Munya
