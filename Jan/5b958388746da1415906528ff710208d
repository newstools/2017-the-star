A rejuvenated Harambee Stars were handed a tricky pool in the qualifiers for the 2019 African Cup of Nations to be held in Cameroon. Kenya were placed in Group &lsquo;F&rsquo; alongside west African powerhouses Ghana as well as East African neighbours Ethiopia and unpredictable Sierra Leone.Stanley Okumbi and his charges are confident of negotiating the pool as they seek to end the agonising wait to return to the continent&rsquo;s showpiece tournament for the first time since 2004.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a a tough pool but we are ready and looking forward to take on our opponents. We are in good shape now and if we can remain focused and take one game at a time then we have an equal chance of qualifying as do all the other three teams in the group,&rdquo; said Okumbi.With the top teams in each of the twelve groups getting an automatic ticket to Yaound&eacute; with the three best runners up joining them, Kenya will be confident of getting through from this group if their current form is anything to go by.Since losing back-to-back qualifying fixtures against Guinea Bissau, who will be making their debut in the biennial tourney which kicks off in Gabon this afternoon, Harambee Stars have not lost a match in tricky fixtures against Zambia, Congo Brazzaville, Congo DR, Sudan and Tanzania.Those run of results have seen the country&rsquo;s stock in the world football rankings rise steadily to its current position of 87 in the world and 20th in the continent having risen two places since the last rankings.The federation has consistently organised friendlies for the national team at every opportune moment, a fact that will hold the Stars in good stead when the qualifiers begin on the weekend of June 5-13&ldquo;It&rsquo;s important that we are ready for the matches when they start and that is the key thing about friendlies as it keeps the team on their toes and in readiness for any competitive match,&rdquo; added the Stars coach. Stars have not met Ghana or Sierra Leone in competitive fixtures recently but have frequently engaged with Ethiopia in regional tourneys.
