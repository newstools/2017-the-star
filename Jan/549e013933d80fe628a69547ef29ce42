Residents of Baqala location in Eldas constituency, Wajir county, have refused to move, despite a government order to voluntarily vacate or be evicted over a boundary dispute.This despite their houses being ransacked and demolished without warning on Friday last week.A border dispute between Eldas and Wajir West constituencies has led to conflict over the years. Both claim the village is in their jurisdiction.Last year, the provincial administration wanted the residents to leave the village and settle elsewhere in Eldas to stop conflicts. However, residents went to court in December to stop forcible eviction by the provincial administration. They say the village is in Eldas constituency.On December 13, Garissa High Court judge George Dulu stopped the state from evicting the residents until the case is determined.During a peaceful demonstration in Baqala village on Sunday, they accused the provincial administration of demolishing their houses despite a court order barring them from doing so.They said their houses were demolished at 3am on Friday, over five hours. Residents said they were not warned or notified of the forced eviction.Resident Abdi Hussein said police surrounded their village, ransacked manyattas and destroyed property.&ldquo;We are suffering. Why did they destroy our houses? Why this brutality, as if we are not Kenyans, when it is clear Baqala is in Eldas?&rdquo; he said.A letter seen by the Star, written on October 24, 1997, indicated that Baqala was in Eldas division. It was written by the permanent secretary for provincial administration to the electoral commission.
