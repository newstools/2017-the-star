TITLEStarSTARRING Jude Demorest, Brittany O&rsquo;Grady, Ryan Destiny GENREDrama, MusicRelease DateDecember 14, 2016After much success with the hit show Empire, creator Lee Daniels has debuted another musical drama while Empire is in a mid-season hiatus. Star follows the lives of three talented young girls, Star, Simone and Alexandra, who dream of being, well, stars. Whilst the broader plot of the story is interesting, a closer look reveals inept lines, extreme plots of young girls who murder someone yet continue being on the internet like nothing happened, and the &lsquo;Glee-like&rsquo; fantasy music video sequences inserted at random intervals. Yes the girls can sing, but the question remains: Do they belong on the small screen or the music charts?Star Rating: 2/5
