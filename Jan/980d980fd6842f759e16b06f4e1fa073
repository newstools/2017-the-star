We all want him found speedily so that we can deal with then case he had filed."Biko added that Too's widows Mary and Sophie had filed affidavits before the court saying they were satisfied with postmortem results showing Too died from a heart problem.The case will be mentioned on January 18.[AUDIO] Blood vein rupture killed Mark Too, exam shows after lawyer's poisoning claimRead: Court stops Monday burial of Mark Too amid fresh 'assassination' claims
