Hotels in the North Rift recorded a more than 50 per cent drop in business during the Christmas and New Year festivities compared to previous years. Hoteliers said there were fewer visitors throughout the period as families avoided outings, citing harsh economic conditions. Paul Kimwar, who runs View Point Restaurant on the escarpments of Kerio Valley, said between December 24 and January 1 he received about 112 visitors compared to 342 during the same period during the 2015 Christmas season. &ldquo;Even those who came spent little, and at the end of the day the income was low unlike in other years,&rdquo; Kimwar said. Goat sellers said the sales were low. Charles Mose of the Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Uasin Gishu, said state firms and private companies did not hold end-year parties.
