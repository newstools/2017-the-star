Deputy President William Ruto joined other Kenyans in ushering in the New Year at a Eldoret Sports Club where he strongly said violence will not be accepted in this year&rsquo;s general election.He said Kenyans must remain united and reject divisive politics. &ldquo;No political leader, politician or political party is bigger than this country," Ruto said. He said the government would do everything possible to ensure the polls will be peaceful."We have only one home called Kenya. No leader is worth giving up our lives or nation and violence cannot be an option," the DP said.Those at the celebrations included governors Salim Mvurya (Kwale), Jackson Mandago (Uasin Gishu) and Cleophas Lagat (Nandi) and several MPs including Oscar Sudi (Kapseret), Alfred Keter (Nandi Hills) and Nairobi woman representative Rachel Shebesh.Comedian Eric Omondi and musicians, including Emmy Kosgei, were at the event.Ruto said Kenyans should elect leaders who will drive the country to the next level based on their scorecard and not tribalism."Let's vote for leaders who have what it takes to take this country forward. We will fail if we elect leaders based on where they come from, the language they speak or the religion they belong to," he said.Ruto had earlier in the day hosted a delegation of 10 governors and 60 MPs, mostly from Central, Rift Valley and Western.He said the Jubilee administration had made several strides in all sectors of the economy since it assumed office 2013.The government had equipped 92 hospitals with referral facilities, including ICU and dialysis machines, Ruto said."In 2013, we had only two hospitals with these facilities serving 40 million Kenyans," he said.Ruto added that 3.3 million Kenyans had been connected with electricity through the Last Mile Connectivity project in the last four years.Central Kenya leaders led by Kiambu Governor William Kabogo said they will back the Jubilee Party next year and ensure Ruto succeeds Uhuru in 2022."The 2022 election will be a walk-over. We will back Ruto because he has stood with President Kenyatta always," he said.
