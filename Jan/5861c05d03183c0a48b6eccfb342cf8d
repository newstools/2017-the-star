Series leaders Kenya Ports Authority women&rsquo;s team start intensive training in Mombasa today hoping to finish the job next weekend when they host Cooperative Bank of Kenya in Game Three of the National Classic basketball league semi-finals play-offsThe dockers who are unbeaten in all competitions locally so have vowed to &lsquo;kill the game&rsquo; in Game three to allow themselves ample time to prepare for the finals that will follow a week later. The semis are being played on best of five series.According to head coach Anthony Ojukwu, the team will embark on serious fitness training ahead of the playoff as he seeks to reclaim they lost to USIU two years ago.&ldquo;I know the players are very unfit after the festivities and thus the reason we want to work on their fitness levels as a priority. We are aware Co-op Bank will not just be coming to Mombasa for a tour,&rdquo; Ojukwu said.According to him, winning the two matches in Nairobi was so satisfying especially considering that they played with a lot of fatigue after returning from the African Club Championships in Maputo, Mozambique. He exuded confidence that the return matches in Mombasa will be easier.&ldquo;If Coop Bank didn&rsquo;t win any of the two games in Nairobi just before Christmas then they should as well forget because the two games found the pool players in a very wrong state of mind,&rdquo; he said. Also expected to play their semi finals matches next weekend are Equity Bank and United States International University (USIU) whose first leg semi-finals matches had to be shelved to allow the students a chance to participate in the Inter University games. According to the fixtures therefore, the men and women finals are slated for January 21.
