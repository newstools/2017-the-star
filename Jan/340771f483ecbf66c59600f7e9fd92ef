Mombasa governor Hassan Joho has written a protest letter to Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet demanding the reinstatement of his bodyguards.Through his lawyer, Joho told Boinnet on Tuesday that he has 24 hours to act on the matter, failure to which he will sue the IG for pulling off the security detail.In the letter by Dennis Mosota, the governor demands that the government gives an equivocal written assurance that it will take responsibility in case anything happens to him.The missive was copied to Coast regional coordinator Nelson Marwa, county commissioner Evans Achoki and State House spokesperson Manoah Esipisu.The lawyer argues that the state's actions were actuated by malice, bad faith and intended to achieve ulterior motives with an objective to settle political scores.Read: Joho, Kingi security detail fiasco &lsquo;not political&rsquo; "Fundamentally, we want to bring it to your knowledge that the actions sanctioned by you and your superiors have no basis and are patently unconstitutional," Mosota said.He also claimed that Joho's rights to a fair administrative action were violated since they (state) did not give him notice to their intended actions."At the time of your action, he was out of the country and did not have an opportunity to either respond or even arrange for alternative security arrangements," the letter adds.He noted that out of the 47 counties, it was only Mombasa county governor who was discriminated upon; further asking that the governor be given alternative security.The governor's bodyguards were pulled out on Friday, some hours after he left with Cord leader Raila Odinga to Ghana for the inauguration of President Nana Akufo-Addo.Read: Joho, Kingi security withdrawal 'purely coincidental', says Boinnet However, media reports indicated that those of Kilifi governor Amason Kingi were equally withdrawn as well as those of the Kilifi speaker Jimmy Kahindi."If as you have alleged in the press, the same ought to have been applied across the board and to all the 47 governors, and with sufficient notice beforehand," Mosota said.He further claimed the action as aimed at embarrassing the governor and making him the subject of public ridicule."Your actions, besides being unconstitutional, are a breach of our client's legitimate expectations of having his security detail until his term comes to an end," he said.This emerged amid reports that Vigilance House had reinstated Joho's security; information that Mombasa Director of Communications Richard Chacha disputed."On the ground, there is nothing of the sort unless the order has just been issued. The governor is still in Ghana, and there is no communication to that effect," Chacha said.Joho's lawyer also dismissed reports that the governor's security detail had been reinstated, adding that it is just an impression the state wants to create."That is the impression they want to create. But in actual fact, nothing of that sort has happened. They have until tomorrow to puts things in order," said Mosota.Read: Senator Omar demands Joho guns audit amid security drama Also read: Governors threaten to sue state over withdrawal of Joho, Kingi bodyguards
