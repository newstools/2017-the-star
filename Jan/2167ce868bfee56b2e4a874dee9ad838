The Gema and Kamba communities at the Coast have signed a political agreement that will see them work together towards the August 8 election.The deal will see them zone the region and support their own candidates for political seats. There are no preferred candidates. This means the communities will only support those who win nominations in their parties. The deal was signed on Saturday by Gema national officials and the Kamba Community Advisory Council at the Panorama Hotel, Mombasa.&ldquo;We agreed to vote as a bloc for our own economic and political empowerment. We&rsquo;ll mobile our communities to register in large numbers,&rdquo; KCAC spokesperson Philip Ndolo told the Star on Monday. He said they will campaign for President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s reelection. Gema organising secretary Paul Kinyanjui said they will focus on the MCA slots.
