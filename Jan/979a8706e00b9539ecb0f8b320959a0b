The agony caused by dry taps in Nairobi is the result of failure to implement a master plan, an NGO says.Green Africa Foundation chairperson Isaac Kalua said water catchment areas have also been encroached on, worsening the situation.&ldquo;We should not be getting water rationing in Nairobi ... Environmental crimes have been committed in main water towers, which are critical for our survival,&rdquo; he said.The water towers are the Mau Forest Complex, Mt Kenya, Aberdare Range and Cherangany Hills.Early this month, the Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company introduced water rationing and warned residents against misusing water.The Ndakaini Dam, the city&rsquo;s major source of water, was declared 40 per cent full, translating into just 33 billion litres of water. Nairobi gets about 540 million litres daily against a demand for 700 million.Launched in 2012, the master plan lays out what needs to be implemented between 2012 and 2030 for adequate supply of safe water to Nairobi and satellite towns up to the year 2035.A major component is the Northern Collector pipeline designed to divert water from a number of rivers flowing from the Aberdare Range. It will supply water to Kiambu and Murang&rsquo;a counties.NCWSC corporate communications manager Mbaruku Vyakweli told the Star their mandate is only to provide water. He added that they will plant more trees and continue fighting those attempting to encroach on water catchment areas.
