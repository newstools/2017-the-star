Wundanyi MP Thomas Mwadeghu has renewed his attacks on Taita Taveta Governor John Mruttu.The MP, planning to run against Mruttu, has been criticising the county boss for allegedly failing to initiate enough development projects. On Friday, Mwadeghu said Mruttu has been mismanaging the county government as he mismanaged Mombasa Oil Refinery where he was CEO before it collapsed. &ldquo;I urge you to elect a reasonable governor like me. I&rsquo;m a CPA holder. We don&rsquo;t know where the governor is leading us. I&rsquo;m not here to attack him, but I don&rsquo;t want him to run the county like the oil refinery that was sold. He was the CEO before it was sold,&rdquo; he said.Mwadeghu spoke at St Judy Educational Centre in Voi during the awards for best students in the KCPE exam.Efforts to reach Mruttu were unsuccessful as he did not pick calls. He told Mruttu to stop being a &ldquo;lone ranger&rdquo; and work with other county leaders. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m bitter because our roads are in poor state. Where are the graders that were bought by the county government?&rdquo; Mwadeghu asked.He also said the county assembly and Senator Dan Mwazo have failed in their oversight duties. &ldquo;If our MCAs would do their job, we would not be facing the problems we have today. I urge you to elect MCAs and not councillors, like you did last time. You should also elect a senator capable of oversighting the county,&rdquo; he said.Speaking separately, youth leader Steven Saleka urged residents to elect visionary leaders who can steer the region to economic prosperity.He said this is the time for youth to take up the region&rsquo;s leadership.&ldquo;The current regime has failed us. The county has received more than Sh10 billion from the national government in four years but nothing concrete has been achieved. People still have the water problems, a food shortage and other problems they faced before devolution,&rdquo; Saleka said.
