Kenya Simbas skipper Brian Nyikuli has hailed the addition of teams to the expanded Africa IA competition slated for later this year.Uganda, Zimbabwe and Namibia join Kenya as the nations that took part in 2016 while Zimbabwe, who were relegated, come up with 1B finalists Tunisia and Senegal.&ldquo;For me, I think it&rsquo;s a better chance, you can&rsquo;t judge a man by just three games so having more teams on board means we need to work harder. Africa Cup has become more competitive because these teams are worth it,&rdquo; he said. Kenya 15s will kick-off the continental matches against Uganda in Nairobi on June 24 before hosting Tunisia the following weekend. The Jerome Paarwater coached side will then play home to Senegal before starting the away matches on July 22nd against Zimbabwe followed by Namibia.
