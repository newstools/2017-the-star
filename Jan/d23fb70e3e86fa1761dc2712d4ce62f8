Destocking programme TanariverIn the Past 10 months the country has been faced with drought disaster which affected thousands of Kenyans.To make matters worse the weather man last week announced that the drought situation would persist for over six months a situation that has raised alarm on the fate of the millions of victims already affected by the disaster.The alarm also comes a time when the Food and Agriculture organization has appealed for US dollars 1 billion (SH. 102 billion) to feed more than 40 million starving people in drought stricken countries worldwide.Kenya is not in the list of the world&rsquo;s most severe countries affected by the disaster but the situation in some of the parts affected particularly the remotest parts which are not accessible is worrying.Latest statistics from the Kenya Red Cross society indicates that over 2.4 million Kenyans shall be starving due to the disaster by April this year.Among those affected and whose story is rarely told or shown in pictures are over 120,000 pastoralists in Tanariver County who live largely in the remote areas due to the nature of their nomadic lifestyle and culture.Generally they are known to suffer loses of their livestock which die as a result of the extreme drought due to lack of pasture and water.In the ongoing drought the pastoralists have experienced losses of thousands of livestock ranging from cattle, goats, sheep and even donkeys due to the impact of the drought and it is feared that the numbers will rise in a month&rsquo;s time if it does not rain.What is worrying most is that pastoralists who are nomads live in furthest end of the county a place where they can easily access water but never easily accessible by even government authorities as frequent as those near towns.Records of their problems, deaths of their livestock is little known as even livestock officers in the county have never been able to reach the areas as frequently as required making it even more difficult to conduct a database of the number of livestock lost.Public health officers also due to the vastness of the areas where pastoralists stay cannot visit them to establish the exact challenges faced by the nomadic people.This has left them feel abandoned and as if they are not living in Kenya as they put it in their own perspective.Last week I managed to accompany Kenya red Cross officials who are implementing a destocking program for the vulnerable pastoralists and it was evident that the pastoralists are not only living in the wilderness but accept the situation as it is .Together with the Humanitarian organization officials the reality downed on us that there are many problems faced by the pastoralists currently and despite the loss of thousands of animals there is more danger ahead.It emerged that pastoralists suffer silently and often live with the pain caused by the disaster .To them it&rsquo;s only God who can come for their rescue and by seeing Kenya red Cross it was a big relief to them as for the first time they would get money to pay school fees for their children and also buy food and other household needs.In all the areas we visited people are desperate and have lost hope describing the current drought as the worst in the history of drought.The area is completely dry, all water sources dried up and their normal livestock market has no value.A Cattle which could initially be bought at Sh. 20,000 or Sh. 25,000 now goes for Sh. 5000 for those who are in the farthest areas.That is if they are lucky to walk with the weak animals to the centre for sales.What was touching most was seeing elderly people as old as 70 years who have no cattle but are forced to walk for long distances to the centre where the programme is being implemented to get meat that may sustain them for three or four days only.The aim of the program which is still going on is to buy livestock from the pastoralists; pay them and slaughter the animals to distribute meat to the community around.To the pastoralists the programme was timely as the drought situation is worsening each day .Each of the villages targeted had almost similar problems caused by the massive deaths of their livestock which are their main source of livelihood.Some of the areas we visited included Merti, Osingo, Buwa ,Bangali, Elrar, Dukanotu, Matagela,Wale Sorea, Bulariq Titile and Koticha in Bura and Galole Sub Counties.The team of Kenya red Cross was led by Coast regional manager Hassan Musa who confirmed that the problem is worse in the remote parts of the county as the locals who depend on livestock for survival no longer have other survival means.At Bangali for example which is 80 kilometres from Garrisa and lies at the border of Tanariver along the highway residents revealed that things may reach out of hand soon.Not all those who flocked the centres visited had cattle; majority came to get the free meat to help them get food which has turned out to be scarce.Those highly affected are women particularly widows who have burden of bringing up children alone .With the drought they have nothing to depend on and are left to suffer alone in their homesteads.Beneficiaries interviewed said the destocking program was key in helping them get funds for buying food, accessing medical services and moresaw taking their children to school.Bangali assistant chief Yusuf Abajila said his area has over 30,000 people who are pastoralists and are in dire need of relief food.He said thousands of livestock have died, out of his 180 goats only 8 are still alive the rest died.&ldquo;Since we did not get enough rain we move around looking for pasture, now there is conflict in Kitui we cannot take our animals there,&rsquo;&rsquo; he says.From August to December the county government was supplying water using water boozers and it really helped the locals.Kenya Red Cross Society Coast regional manager said the program is aimed at assisting the pastoralists get funds and meat at the same time after the huge loss of their livestock due to drought.Coincidentally the programme begun in the week when schools were being opened .Musa said they would implement the programmes to all the areas which were highly affected by the drought and they would follow them to their villages in the remote areas.He said in the first phase they shall buy 450 cattle, 246 goats and sheep .&ldquo;The beneficiaries get money and meat, one can decide to keep the money and buy livestock when the situation gets back to normal or use the money for other purposes like education,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said.During the destocking Musa said they also give cattle to schools to help them in their school feeding programs.&ldquo;Secondary schools shall be given two cattle heads; and livestock which are in poor health are bought , slaughtered and buried,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said.Ms Fatuma Aden a mother of seven children from Duka notu village could not hide her joy after selling her cow at Sh. 11,000.&ldquo;This programme is good, am so happy I had a debt of Sh. 22,000 and I have now paid the Sh. 11,000 I received , if other organizations come I will sell more and finish my debt,&rsquo;&rsquo; she said.Ms Aden says she had 50 cows when the drought started but now only 10 are remaining.&ldquo;Twenty cows died, I sold 20 and am now left with 10 cattle but with nothing to eat,&rsquo;&rsquo; she says.During the prolonged drought and lack of money she said shopkeepers introduced barter trade.One goat is exchanged with one bundle of 24 kilograms maize flour because there is no money and people are desperately in need of food.Due to the problems Ms Aden was forced to stop livestock rearing and venture into miraa business just to survive.&ldquo;I only sell two kilograms of miraa and get a profit of Sh. 10 in each kilogramme, now even the clients do not have money they take miraa on credit,&rsquo;&rsquo; she says.Shuku Abdulahi 22 a mother of four children says she has a big burden of rearing six other children left behind by her co wife who died last month after a short illness.She had nine goats but five have died since and is left with only four at home.Ms Abdulahi who benefitted with meat said she takes food on credit and spends Sh. 2000.&ldquo;The meat I got today will help me for three days then I get back to the normal challenges,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said.She urged other humanitarian organisations to come in for their support before the situation worsens .Another furthest village is Buya which is 70 kilometres away from Madogo at the border of Tanariver and Garissa.The area has seasonal rivers and streams which all dried up, the pastoralists are forced to move to long distance to get pastures and pasture for their animals.They however did not benefit in the program as their condition was to sell their livestock at a fixed price of Sh. 15,000 for cattle and Sh.5000 for goats and sheep.This was not accepted by the Kenya red cross as their livestock were weak, small and not worth the amount and despite advise that they would bargain with individual owners they refused.On Thursday the team visited Koticha and was received with excitement as , over 200 people turned up to get free meat.Residents interviewed said the programme had come at a time of need as they had no other means of getting cash with the continuous loss of cattle.Mrs. Fatuma Fara of Bangali says Kenya red Cross was doing a humanitarian activity to destock the livestock as pastoralists were suffering and the disaster might last .Currently she said the major challenge faced by the locals was accessing food as many animals have died.She said if other organizations could introduce such a programme and the government supplement with relief food supply it would really address the problems faced by locals. MS Fara lost 30 goats in the disaster and has nothing left to depend on in the family.Similar tales were evident in many other villages which benefited in the programme.All beneficiaries have hailed the Kenya Red Cross for their effort in reaching them at their home ground despite the long distance.The officials accompanied by a Livestock officer, and a public health officer, meet the pastoralists for assessment of their health standards after which they bargain the process.Cattle are bought at a price between Sh.10,000 and Sh. 15,000 while goats go at a rate of between Sh. 5000 to Sh. 3000. A Sheep on the other hand is bought at between Sh. 2000 to Sh. 3000.Thousands of livestock have died in Tanariver county following the drought that has been described as the worst in the history as the pastoralists have no access to pasture and water.Other areas which will benefit include Wayu , Asa and Kone among others.Currently most pastoralists are in Bura Sub County which received rainfall and due to the over stocking the resources will soon be exhausted and its feared there could not only be loss of lives of livestock but even humans.The disaster according to elders is the worst to experience. In the previous droughts livestock could get water but now they can go for three days without the resource.
