The JSC has expressed concerns about attacks on courts and the judicial process, citing Aden Duale's criticism of judge George Odunga.Legislators led by Duale, who is National Assembly majority leader and Garissa Town MP, had said they would file a motion on Odunga's conduct.They threatened to do so as the judge prepared to rule on Cord's application to stop Parliament from debating amendments to election laws.The Judicial Service Commission praised Chief Justice David Maraga for defending Odunga, who is the head of the Judicial Review division of the High Court.&ldquo;...the rule of law is the basis of any civilised and democratic society and any action or conduct that undermines the administration of justice by the courts must be condemned if not punished. Otherwise the country would slide to anarchy," said secretary Anne Amadi.Amadi is the Judiciary's Chief Registrar.Read: Stop 'public lynching' of judges, CJ Maraga tells DualeAlso read: LSK condemns Duale attack on judge George OdungaShe issued a statement on Friday after the commission held its first meeting of the year.The commission said it will not be cowed and will stand firm against the &ldquo;public lynching&rdquo; of judges or magistrates for their decisions.Amadi said disobedience to courts and &ldquo;raw and irresponsible exercise of power&rdquo;, could undermine public confidence in the Judiciary.She said Kenyans should respect and promote the independence of the Judiciary in dispute resolution.
