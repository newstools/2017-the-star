Kenya rugby 15&rsquo;s team have opted out of the Currie Cup slated for next month in South Africa.Kenya had applied to the South Africa Rugby Union in November to play in the tournament which brings together the top provincial sides in the country but as of last week they had not responded..Kenya Rugby Union acting chief executive officer and director of rugby, Thomas Odundo said: &ldquo;We applied to take part in the competition and wanted a response this month to factor the event in our planning but they have told us to wait until February which will be too late as we need to start our preparations early considering we have a busy 2017 ahead of us.&rdquo;&ldquo;We do have a busy itinerary with all these matches potentially lined up. I believe they will serve as adequate preparation for the team as we focus on the Rugby World Cup qualifiers set for 2018,&rdquo; he said.This year promises to be busy for the Simbas with eight fixtures lined up for Jerome Paarwater&rsquo;s side. Six fixtures are already confirmed, starting with the Elgon Cup first leg away to Uganda on June 10 with the return leg a fortnight later doubling up as the opening round of the Africa Cup Division 1A which has been expanded. The event will be a six-team affair with Senegal and Tunisia already incorporated into the competition alongside Namibia, Kenya, Zimbabwe and Uganda.Kenya will play four Africa Cup fixtures over successive weekends in July, starting with two home fixtures against Tunisia (July 8) and Senegal (July 15) before winding up their campaign away to Zimbabwe (July 22) and Namibia (July 29).Odundo further disclosed that the team could host a two-match Test series against Hong Kong in Nairobi in late August, noting: &ldquo;This is still under discussion and subject to confirmation from both the Kenyan and Hong Kong unions.&rdquo;
