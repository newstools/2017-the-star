Heads of secondary schools from Kakamega county have dismissed calls to have the results of last year&rsquo;s KCSE exam audited.They said those calling for a review of the results are taking the country a step backwards.County Secondary School Heads Association chairman Godfrey Owori said Education CS Fred Matiang&rsquo;i should keep issuing strict orders to streamline the sector.Kenya National Union of Teachers secretary general Wilson Sossion and opposition leader Raila Odinga have called for an audit, saying the results were not credible.But Owori said the results reflected the actual performance by the candidates.&ldquo;I know there are cartels at the Kenya National Examination Council used to manipulate results in favour of certain schools at a fee. They are now fighting back through other institutions to disparage the credibility of the exercise,&rdquo; Owori said.The St Peter&rsquo;s High School Mumias principal said the cartels would give leakage to schools a few months to the exams.&ldquo;During marking, they would collude with teachers to change grades. This resulted in lazy teachers giving their schools high grades at the expense of committed schools, which were awarded demoralising grades,&rdquo; Owori said.He supported Matiang&rsquo;i for the fast release of the exam results, saying it was meant to prevent the cartels from manipulating grades after marking.HALF-BAKED GRADUATESOwori asked Matiang&rsquo;i to extend the strict measures to the universities, &ldquo;which are producing half-baked graduates&rdquo;.&ldquo;Many of the graduates are not able to perform on the job because they were beneficiaries of leaked exams with fake grades and were admitted for courses they did not deserve,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Many students graduate from the universities as engineers and doctors but we end up getting expatriates from China and India doing the jobs because our graduates didn&rsquo;t qualify.&rdquo; Owori said cheating is more serious in the universities than secondary schools and some students at the university carry books to exam rooms to duplicate answers.VET VARSITIESOwori said universities need to be vetted thoroughly and politicians barred from acquiring degrees without sitting in class for the lectures. &ldquo;We always see politicians running up and down in campaigns throughout the year and eventually see them graduating. When do they sit in class to study or they just buy the degrees?&rdquo; he said.
