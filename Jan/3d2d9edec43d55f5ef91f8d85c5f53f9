Former Malindi MP Lucas Maitha yesterday announced he will run for Kilifi senator. The Kenya National Bureau of Statistics chairman dropped his bid for Malindi MP after losing two times.Maitha will face incumbent Senator Stewart Madzayo. He made the announcement after meeting elders from the Malindi District Cultural Association and Dhome in Malindi town.Maitha did not announce his party ticket, but said he will work with the Third Force team trying to remove Governor Amason Kingi. He said Malindi deserves serious leaders to bring change and safeguard its resources.Maitha asked why Madzayo did not cooperate with MCAs after learning that millions of shillings had been stolen from the county.&ldquo;Madzayo is well learned; he is a retired judge but is not qualified for the seat. I have a track record of development, I&rsquo;m not corrupt and I brought development during my tenure as MP for Malindi,&rdquo; he said.Maitha is a vocal and authoritative speaker. He was defeated by Kilifi North MP Gideon Mung&rsquo;aro in 2002, after serving only one term. Twice he has failed to recapture the seat.During the March 7 Malindi by-election last year Maitha supported Jubilee candidate Phillip Charo, who lost to ODM&rsquo;s Willy Mtengo. He indicated he will work with former Labour CS Kazungu Kambi, Prof Gabriel Katana and Deputy Governor Kennedy Kamto, who have fallen out with Kingi. The three are in Kadu Asili. Other candidates for senator include former Cabinet minister Morris Dzoro, Chigiri Chigiri of Wiper and Ken Nyale. Madzayo, who is in ODM, has made a major return to the county and is campaigning hard.
