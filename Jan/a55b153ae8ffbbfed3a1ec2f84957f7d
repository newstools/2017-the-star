Bomet county commissioner Bernard Leparmarai has threatened to arrest administrators collecting residents&rsquo; IDs and registering them as members of Governor Isaac Rutto&rsquo;s CCM party.On Wednesday, Leparmarai said the move is illegal and could interfere with voter registration.He said he has received numerous complaints from local leaders that residents are being lured to surrender their IDs and paid to register as CCM members. Leparmarai said detectives have been deployed across the county to nab the administrators.&ldquo;We want to send a strong message to those individuals that their days are numbered,&rdquo; he said.Bomet Senator Wilfred Lesan, National Assembly Deputy Speaker Joyce Laboso and 10 MCAs, led by Kapletundo&rsquo;s Bernard Ngeno, blamed CCM for the low turnout during voter registration. The group is affiliated to the Jubilee Party.Lesan said, &ldquo;Less than 20,000 people have been registered since the process began and we suspect one reason is that CCM officials and county administrators are buying IDs from residents and holding them.&rdquo;However, Rutto denied the claims, and said party officials are harassed by administrators. Addressing the press after a meeting party officials, he said there is nothing wrong with agents signing up residents to CCM. &ldquo;Our agents are being harassed by chiefs and some have had to abandon registration after being threatened,&rdquo; Rutto said.He criticised Leparmarai for issuing a directive stopping party member listing during the mass voter registration drive.&ldquo;We know they just want to stop us from recruiting members because they have realised and fear many residents might join our new party instead of Jubilee,&rdquo; Rutto said.
