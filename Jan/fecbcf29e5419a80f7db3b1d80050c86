National women&rsquo;s football team Harambee Starlets player Vivian Corazon was feted the Most Valuable Player as the curtains came down on the second edition of the Kenya women&rsquo;s football tournament at the Camp Toyoyo grounds on Sunday.Corazan was outstanding during the week-long event for her side PCEA which finished third in the 13-team tournament dubbed Girls Unlimited. Otto Benecker defended their title with 4-1 win over Kujibamba during the final. Elizabeth Ambogo and Winnie Kanyotu were on target for the champions, as Purity Nyongesa netted for Kujibamba before the break. On resumption, Christine Nafula scored Otto&rsquo;s third goal before Purity Nyongesa scored an own goal to hand the champions the win.Kujibamba had defeated Kayole Starlets 2-1 in the first semi before Champions Benecker held the nerve to see off Amani Queens in the post-match penalties having played to a barren draw in the regular time in the second semi at the same venue.Others who received accolades include Benecker&rsquo;s midfielder Christine Nafula who won the &lsquo;Golden Boot&rsquo; with 11 goals and PCEA&rsquo;s Judith Osimbo, who bagged the Golden Gloves.
