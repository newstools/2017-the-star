Kikuyus in Garissa have formed a group to protect their interests, a few months after a recording urging the eviction of non-natives circulated on social media.The 3000-member group is made up of professionals and business people. Association chairman John Kamau said their aim is to advocate members' welfare and foster peace and cohesion between them and their host community.He addressed the press at a local hotel on Monday after being elected into office. &ldquo;For a long time, because of a lack of unity amongst ourselves, we have seen a lot of opportunities slip through our hands,&rdquo; Kamau said."This time round, as the political landscape in this region takes shape, we intend to ensure our members are also represented in the final decisions."This is the latest in a series of ethnic realignments as the August 8 general election approaches. Communities that live away from their native counties are forming groupings to sway the politics of their host areas.Speaking to the press separately, Garissa Christian Community chairman Patrick Okello said every Kenyan has a right to vote without intimidation from the high and mighty.He urged Kenyans to respect one another and embrace peace and unity during the electioneering period. Okello urged non-locals to be wary of politicians out to create animosity between them and the locals for selfish political gain.
