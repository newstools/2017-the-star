Parliament will wind up all crucial bills and business of importance by March 30, National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale has said.MPs resume today for the House&rsquo;s 5th and last session, cutting short their holiday after they made an alteration of the House Calendar for it to resume on January 24 as opposed to February 7.The changed dates will allow the House to discuss the budget issue, including the Division of Revenue Bill and the supplementary estimates.The Senate will resume on February 14.Expected quorum hitchSpeaking to the press in Garissa town yesterday, Duale said that from next week the House is likely to face a quorum hitch as the majority of members will be focussing on the August 8 election.&ldquo;We, however, expect our members to balance between their campaign and their cardinal duty of legislation as enshrined in the Constitution within the reading of Article 94,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;In the unlikely event a member loses in the party primaries, then he or she will only be coming to the House to finish his term. But his loyalty will no longer be to any party so it will be very difficult to lobby the member.&rdquo;.Duale said among the business that will be transacted are the budget estimates 2017-18. The Budget Policy Statement has already been approved by the House, he said.&ldquo;We expect the CS Finance to table the budget estimates, both revenue and expenditure, latest by next week Tuesday, so that it can be referred to various departmental committees,&rdquo; Duale said.Possible financial crisisSpeaker Justin Muturi warned of a possible financial crisis as Parliament will possibly adjourn sittings two months before the elections.The National Treasury plans to have the National Budget read early to ensure the 2017-18 budget is appropriated in good time for smooth operations before and after the General Election.MPs last month met Cabinet Secretaries and independent and constitutional office holders to get their input on proposed budget ceilings capped on the respective recurrent and development expenditure estimates.Budget is the priorityDuale said that all the bills related to the budget-making process will be dealt with expeditiously.
