The majority of Kwale residents focus on weddings but avoid the responsibility of educating their children, Taita Taveta University acting vice chancellor Hamadi Boga has said.&ldquo;Parents would rather stay with their children at home and avoid the shame that comes with lack of good food at the wedding,&rdquo; he said.Boga urged the residents to educate their children so they can promote growth. He said instead of spending a lot of money on weddings, residents can use it to pay for their children&rsquo;s school fees or fund-raise for the bright but needy students. Boga said, &ldquo;I tried to help a Msambweni female student to organise a fundraiser for her university fees, but locals didn&rsquo;t respond well.&rdquo;
