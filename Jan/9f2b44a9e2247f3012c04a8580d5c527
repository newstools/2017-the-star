Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet has said Mandera is safe despite Monday's terror attack, in which a Kenya police reservist was killed and an Equity Bank branch was partly destroyed. Boinnet, speaking in Mandera town on Tuesday, said there is no country in the world which is completely safe from crime because criminals utilise any available opportunity to strike. His visit came a day after the terror attack despite a curfew that was extended by a government gazette notice dated March 29, last year. The Monday morning attack was executed within the CBD. The police are yet to make any arrest. Suspected al Shabaab terrorist planted explosives at the Mandera Equity Bank branch which destroyed the front window panes and blocks making the rear part of the building. Banks remained closed on Monday. Area county commissioner Fredrick Shisia said the attackers were targeting the Jabane Hotel, where eight non-local residents had boarded with 10 other locals. The attackers planted three improvised explosive devices at the hotel which is adjacent to the hotel and one on a path where security agents pass. Boinett said his visit was in line with streamlining security operations in the region through consultations with the region’s security agents. Mandera has experienced several terror attacks since the country moved its troops inside Somalia in 2011. The IG was making his first visit in the region since he was appointed in December 2014 after numerous terror attacks where some 28 people travelling in a bus were killed by the Al Shabaab in November 2014 with 36 miners killed in Koromey quarry in December the same year. He called on residents to cooperate with police to curb terror activities in the region.
