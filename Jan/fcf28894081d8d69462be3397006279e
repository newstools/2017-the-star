It is not in dispute that Nairobi is the capital county of Kenya and also accounts for almost 50 per cent of GDP. Therefore Nairobi is a very special county and in fact holds a unique place in the Republic of Kenya, given that it is the hub of communication and of commerce.It is basically the centre of business in East and Central Africa and therefore it holds a very strategic position that goes beyond Kenya.Nairobi should therefore not get the same treatment as any other city in East and Central Africa &ndash; and neither should it get similar treatment like any other county.Being the most strategic county, you have seen what has happened in the last four years where governance performance has been very mediocre.Basically, there is nothing to show with almost Sh200 billion raised from taxes and allocations from the national government.We have actually gone back in terms of service delivery, in terms of infrastructure development.When a capital county like Nairobi is mismanaged, the impact goes beyond Kenya and is felt across the national borders.It is therefore imperative that, as a capital county, Nairobi is transferred into the hands of competent managers who have demonstrated their ability in terms of management.In Nairobi, you are managing resources beyond money and when all these resources are harnessed properly, the ripple effect is felt beyond both internal and international boundaries.Nairobi therefore needs a competent and qualified management, which is precisely what it has lacked in the last four years under Cord.To capture Nairobi, the most unfortunate thing is that you must be in a very strong party and tribe, as 95 per cent of the city&rsquo;s voters look at the party.Unfortunately, if you don't have a strong party or don&rsquo;t draw your strength from tribal numbers, the chances of your ascending to the leadership of this county are slim.The remaining five per cent must also come out and make that difference beyond the parties and the tribes.Anyone who wants to be Nairobi Governor must tell us what needs to be done, how it will be done and how it will be financed.If we give this city to the wrong hands for another five years, Nairobi will collapse &ndash; because we are already at a debt level of Sh50 billion.
