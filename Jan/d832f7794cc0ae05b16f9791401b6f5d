Kenya&rsquo;s leading football stout Guinness has begun renovating Ndakaini Stadium in Murang&rsquo;a County.This is the first of four community stadia that Guinness is refurbishing across the country under its &lsquo;Made of Football&rsquo; community projects. The programme seeks to touch the local community and improve football experiences for Kenyans.Whereas the &lsquo;Made of Football&rsquo; programme focuses on football, the Ndakaini Stadium rehabilitation will include a standardized football pitch, marked running track, new terraces for spectators and branding. Guinness is also set to put up a modern ablution block and changing rooms. The Ndakaini Stadium refurbishment will take four months to complete.Samuel Wasswa, the marketing manager Guinness and Portfolio beers at Kenya Breweries Limited, said the cost of the programme will differ from one stadium to the next.&ldquo;We, Guinness, want to provide better experiences for players and fans as well as improve the source of livelihoods for communities living around the stadiums. We will assess the needs of each stadium and pump in money enough to achieve the desired goals,&rdquo; said Wasswa during the ground breaking ceremony. &ldquo;The Guinness &lsquo;Made of Football&rsquo; programme celebrates passionate football players and fans across the country and the lengths they go to show their love for the game. These community pitches provide spaces for many to practise, improve their football skills, and engage in constructive pastime. We believe this will significantly develop the pool of Kenya&rsquo;s football talent and the enjoyment football,&rdquo; added Wasswa.Professor Joseph Kimura, the Ndakaini Dam Environmental Conservation Association (NDEKA) chairman said: &ldquo;We are very excited to partner with Guinness and we are looking forward to having a space where our talent can be nurtured and our local community can gather to watch the games.
