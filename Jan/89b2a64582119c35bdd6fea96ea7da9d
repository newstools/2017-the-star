Nakuru Governor Kinuthia Mbugua was humiliated in his own backyard on Thursday, when he was booed and heckled in front of Deputy President William Ruto.Crowds jeered as he tried to address them at Pinkam in Nakuru town. Last year, he was heckled at the same place in front of President Uhuru Kenyatta on a tour to commission development projects.After Ruto addressed the crowd, he handed over the microphone to Nakuru Town East MP David Gikaria and speaker Susan Kihika, before passing it on to Mbugua. The crowds insisted former NTSA chairman Lee Kinyanjui address them. He is running against Mbugua in theAugust 8 polls. A disappointed Mbugua returned the microphone back to Ruto. The governor was among other Nakuru leaders who had accompanied Ruto to Kuresoi, Salgaa and Molo to mobilise residents to register as voters.Gikaria and Kihika assured Ruto they will deliver 400,000 votes from residents with IDs who have not registered as voters.Kinyanjui addressed the crowd for less than two minutes, saying Nakuru people need change because they have been let down for the past five years.He said the county will vote for Jubilee. After Kinyanjui addressed the crowd, Ruto took the microphone and said he and Uhuru are committed to free, fair and transparent Jubilee Party nominations.
