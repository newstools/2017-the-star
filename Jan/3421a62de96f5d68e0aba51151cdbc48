Cord leaders have accused Senate Speaker Ekwee Ethuro of helping Jubilee to carry the day in the vote on controversial election laws.They told the press on Friday that Ethuro influenced the outcome of the division vote on Election Laws (Amendment) Act, 2016.Senate passed the disputed amendments allowing manual identification of voters during the August 8 general election if electronic register fails.Jubilee senators outnumbered their Cord counterparts, voting 24 to 19 to pass the amendments at its second reading, after a heated debate that extended past 8pm.Bungoma senator Moses Wetang'ula, who is Cord co-principal, accused Ethuro of working with Jubilee to perpetrate malpractice."The Speaker conspired with Jubilee and rigged the vote. He has imported the bad manners of cheating to the Senate," said Wetang'ula.The Ford Kenya leader further accused Ethuro of not taking full control of the August House during the debate, siding instead with Jubilee members."That bill was doomed to fail. We will take legal action to redress this," he said, terming Thursday, when the amendments were approved, "a sad day for the country"."When the Speaker rigs an election because he is conducting himself as a representative of the Jubilee regime, it is unfortunate."He noted speakers are supposed to represent the whole country and that steps will be taken to restore sanity.Read: Senate backs controversial vote methodWetang'ula said the results of the senate session now lays a firm foundation for stealing elections."Everybody should reject it .

Rise above this challenge and save the nation," he said.Kalonzo described Ethuro's action as unfortunate and said Kenyans will know their next step during the Bomas meeting."We are inviting all our members and aspirants to the meeting so we can take one stance and know how we will move forward," he said."The whole country watched the debate. This election will be stolen. Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery should be ready because we will not allow such theft to continue."Kalonzo said Kenya is a democratic country and they will remain steadfast."I am asking Kenyans to stay calm. We will not take this lying down," the Wiper leader said.Former Lugari MP Cyrus Jirongo termed the events at the Senate primitive, and said the public must not accept to be taken back to an era of dictatorship."This has to be stopped. The will of the people cannot be stopped," he said.Senators retreated to their party cocoons on Thursday as they debated a divisive report on the contentious Bill.A joint committee of the Senate, that had been tasked to carry out public hearings on the Bill, failed to agree on whether IEBC should use manual backup or not, hence the vote.Jubilee members in the committee won by 10 votes, to agree with the National Assembly, against six votes by their Cord counterparts.In their report, there was agreement that "Section 44A may be unnecessary because it is catered for under section 44 of the Elections Act, 2011, and the regulations should be anchored in section 44 of the Elections Act, 2011".But the joint committee, Legal Affairs and Human Rights and Information and Technology, co-chaired by Busia Senator Amos Wako and Nyeri's Mutahi Kagwe could not reach a consensus on the Bill.Read: Cord moves to court, wants planned election laws debate suspended
