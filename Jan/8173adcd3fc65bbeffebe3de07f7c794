Ford Kenya will work with its coalition partners to ensure it does not lose the Bungoma governor seat a second time, party leader Moses Wetang'ula has said. He said the coalition parties are in talks to field one strong candidate so as not to split the votes and give the Jubilee candidate an easy win. "We want to capture all the governor seats in Western and all the other elective seats in the coming polls. We are working on the modalities to have our candidates come together on that course," he said. Wetang'ula spoke on Friday during the funeral of boda boda operator Ferdinand Wekesa in Namwacha village in Kanduyi.He said Governor Kenneth Lusaka has not lived up to voters' expectations. Wetang'ula said residents want a sober and responsible governor who will grow the county economically. He said if Wycliffe Wangamati wins the party nominations he will work with Alfred Khang'ati of ODM. Wetang'ula dismissed rumours that he will run for governor. He said his eyes are fixed on the presidency and nothing short of that.I'm working with ODM leader Raila Odinga, Wiper's Kalonzo Musyoka, ANC's Musalia Mudavadi and Kanu on how to send Jubilee parking, Wetang'ula said. He urged voters to support the opposition and make this a reality as Jubilee has failed Kenyans. Wangamati urged residents to register as voters in their numbers. The IEBC mass voter registration begins today.
