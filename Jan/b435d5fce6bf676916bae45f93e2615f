Governor Evans Kidero has blamed political rivals for the attack on journalists and his convoy on Wednesday in Dandora. He said on Thursday the attack was part of a &ldquo;wider dirty scheme&rdquo; by his opponents to brand him &ldquo;violent and an enemy of the people&rdquo; and scuttle his chances of retaining the seat. &ldquo;If they have a problem with me, they should direct the attack on me, not the innocent young men and women who are reporting the truth,&rdquo; Kidero said. Three Mediamax journalists were injured after a unruly youths attacked and stoned the governor&rsquo;s entourage. Sarah Ndungu (People Daily), Patrick Kimanthai, (K24 TV), Charles Mathai, (People Daily) and their driver Edward Mungai had covered the governor&rsquo;s event at Friends Secondary School in Dandora II. Kidero termed the attack primitive behaviour. He warned politicians against inciting residents to violence.
