The High Court yesterday ordered the Technical University of Kenya to hold a special graduation ceremony for 34 students who failed to graduate last year because they missed a unit.The students said they were informed of the new unit a year after they completed their studies, and just before the scheduled graduation.The students&rsquo; lawyer said the university department acknowledged a failure but did not rectify it and was neither remorseful nor apologetic.The students did not graduate in the fourth graduation held on December 20 last year.Justice George Odunga said the special graduation on April 20 this year will remedy an injustice against the Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering students.The case was filed by students Josphat Koilege, Gideon Mutunga and Fredrick Kipngok suing vice chancellor Francis Aduol as the first respondent. In the suit, lawyer Ham Langat said the students successfully completed all the requisite units for the programme as required by the university.When they were preparing for graduation last year, they were informed in November by Dr Rogers Kirui, chairman of the Mechanical Engineering Department, that their class would not graduate because it did not complete &lsquo;Computer Aided Design and Manufacturing.&rsquo;&ldquo;The said unit never existed before and it was introduced after the recently launched facility at the university ,to their detriment,&rdquo; the lawyer said.He said that on December 5, a meeting was called by the VC, leading to a communication that they would not graduate with rest of the students and they should wait until this year.&ldquo;The information was informally communicated one year after they finished their studies and just one month to scheduled graduation,&rdquo; Lagat said.The lawyer said the university violated the students&rsquo; rights.He said the irregularities were disturbing, as a university is supposed to adhere to the rules and laws of Kenya. They are not to serve &ldquo;as havens of frustrations subverting the legitimate expectations of students,&rdquo; he said.Lagat said during a meeting, Prof Reuben Marwanga, director of the School of Mechanical and Process Engineering, admitted a departmental failure and he promised to discuss it with authorities.In an affidavit sworn by Koilege, he said they met with the management and a week to the graduation, the institution had not come up with a solution.
