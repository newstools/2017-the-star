Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko has accused Starehe MP Maina Kamanda of threatening JP aspirants opposed to Peter Kenneth's bid for city governor.Sonko, who is one of the aspirants, claimed Kamanda pledged to ensure all those who do not support Kenneth do not win Jubilee Party nominations.&ldquo;Kamanda is threatening governor, MP and MCA aspirants. He is saying that if you do not join the camp supporting Kenneth's bid, you will not get the Jubilee ticket,&rdquo; he said.He spoke during Team Nairobi's voter registration mobilisation rally at Kibagare grounds in Kangemi last week.Kamanda did not answer the Star's phone calls for comment on the matter.The race for the governor seat held by Evans Kidero (ODM) has resulted in the formation of two factions in Jubilee Party.Team Nairobi is made up of Sonko, Dagoretti South MP Dennis Waweru, former Starehe MP Margaret Wanjiru and nominated MP Johnson Sakaja.The four are opposed to Kenneth's bid, which is supported by Kamanda, Nominated Senator Beatrice Elachi and MPs Rachel Shebesh (woman representative) and James Gakuya (Embakasi North).Sonko has severely criticised Kenneth, terming him a foreigner who is not welcome to the race. Kenneth is from Murang'a county.The Senator dismissed reports that he accepted to be Kenneth's running mate in the August 8 poll.He also asked the aspirant to issue a public apology to the President and the nation for opposing him in 2013.Read more: Peter Kenneth wanted Uhuru jailed at ICC, must apologise to Kenyans - SonkoAlso read: Sonko dismisses Peter Kenneth running mate report as 'joke of the year'Sonko assured supporters and aspirants for the county chief seat that JP nominations will be free and fair.He asked Kamanda to stop threatening aspirants and Kenneth to join Team Nairobi and fight for the party ticket instead of waiting to be hand-picked.&ldquo;We respect you (Kamanda) but stop playing with city residents,&rdquo; he said.The ruling coalition is yet to settle for a candidate to vie against Kidero.In a meeting held at Deputy President William Ruto's residence in Karen three weeks a go, it was agreed that a consensus would be used to make the selection.But Sonko's team is said to have opposed this approach, saying it was part of a plot to bring Kenneth in through the back door.Kidero is ODM and NASA's sole candidate.
