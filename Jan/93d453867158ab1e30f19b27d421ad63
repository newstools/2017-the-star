There is a wrong perception about the Jubilee Party and President Uhuru Kenyatta at the Coast, Mvita MP aspirant Omar Shallo has said. He said statements by some opposition leaders that Uhuru has been riding on county and donor-funded projects are untrue. &ldquo;There is a wrong perception about Uhuru. There are so many development projects his administration has initiated at the Coast. We should stop propagating propaganda that mislead Kenyans,&rdquo; Shallo said on Saturday. Last week, Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho accused the Jubilee administration of taking credit for projects funded by donors. Uhuru was in Mombasa, where he commissioned the Buxton footbridge, the Bamburi storm water drainage system and the Ziwa la Ng&rsquo;ombe slum upgrading project. Joho, also the ODM deputy party leader, told Uhuru to stop clinging to projects initiated more than five years ago.
