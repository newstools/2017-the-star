A Nairobi lawyer Joel Koskei has declared his bid to unseat Bomet Senator Wilfred Lesan on the Jubilee ticket.His entry into the race is seen to be a game changer in the battle for the seat, which has attracted youthful candidates among them Enock Kemei, Stacy Chepkemoi and Paul Chirchir.Kanu&rsquo;s secretary General Nick Salat who claims to have been rigged out in favour of the incumbent will also be running for the seat.More than 10 MCAs from the county both in the Jubilee wing and Governor Isaac Rutto's CCM have endorsed Koskei for the slot.
