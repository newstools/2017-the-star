Pressure continues to mount on the Ministry of Education with church leaders becoming the latest to ask for an audit on the recently released KCSE results.Bishop Robert Langat of the Africa Gospel Church, Kenya yesterday said there was need for the results to be reviewed, noting that the drastic decline in the number of students scoring good marks, unlike in the past, was worrying and raises more questions. Langat said as clerics, they support Education CS Fred Matiang&rsquo;i&rsquo;s efforts in wiping out cartels in the sector and in ensuring quality education. He spoke at Chelsa Academy in Bomet. He, however, said that although there was need to make national exams results credible, it was wrong to punish students and damage the reputation of some schools by lowering the number of good grades. He said it was sad most students got low grades, which will not enable them to pursue university education.
