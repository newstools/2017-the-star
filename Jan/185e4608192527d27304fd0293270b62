Nairobi advocate Ogamba Migosi has told off Kisii Senator Chris Obure over recent remarks that the Kisii should join Jubilee.&ldquo;Who told Obure that Jubilee will form the next government? It is not automatic. Even ODM can form the next government. Chances of Jubilee being in the opposition are very high,&rdquo; Ogamba said.Migosi is in running for the Kitutu Chache North parliamentary seat. He told Obure and other Jubilee leaders to stop hoodwinking voters by saying they can only enjoy development if they are in government.Obure was elected on an ODM ticket but says he will run for governor on a Jubilee Party ticket.&ldquo;Jubilee campaigners should look for another agenda. All Kenyans are entitled to development, whether they are in government or in the opposition. Telling people to vote for Jubilee in order to be in government is cheap,&rdquo; he said. Migosi will fight for the ODM ticket with university don James Arege and Elijah Kombo.The trio have applied for nomination after paying Sh250,000 nomination fee and Sh20,000 life membership fee. Migosi also warned that President Uhuru Kenyatta risks being a one-term President unless he reins in corruption.
