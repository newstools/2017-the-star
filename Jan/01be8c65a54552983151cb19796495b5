Early today morning, a man sent money to coast based singer Nyota Ndogo for a surprise experience for his girlfriend.Basically, she got paid Sh20,000 for a 2 minute job.Nyota Ndogo spoke to Word Is about how the request that came at 5:30am when she was preparing her children to go to school, was like no other she has ever received.The man wanted Nyota to give her girlfriend a wake up call at 6am in the morning and sing for her "happy birthday"."In my whole life, I will be honest. I have never been paid to sing over the phone. It was a surprising request. At first I thought the Mpesa message was sent to my phone by mistake. As I was jotting down his number so I can call him back, he called and made the request," Nyota said in a phone interview with Word Is.What touched Nyota Ndogo to the core was the thought and love that the man put in coming up with such a special and unique birthday experience for the girlfriend."Wow machozi yamenidondoka sio kwa hela japo hela nazo tamu but kwa mapenzi ya kweli kwa mrembo wake. Yani machozi ya furaha kumbe kuna watu bado wanajua kupenda? Sema Ahsante kweli wewe ni MUNGU," Nyota wrote on her facebook page.Listen to Nyota Ndogo talk about the very unique birthday request, how the birthday girl received the suprise call and how Nyota plans to spend the money.
