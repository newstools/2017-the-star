ODM leader Raila Odinga's visit to Kwale was marred by confusion as two rival political groups engaged in a supremacy battle.A group led by the party's officials in the county planned a rally at Masai grounds in Ukunda, Msambweni, while that led by MP Suleiman Dori organised another at Kombani Primary School in Matuga.Kwale ODM secretary Omar Boga said their leader had no option but to attend the meeting organised by the officials.He said attending the other rally would leave the region divided and likely result in Governor Salim Mvurya's re-election. "The Kombani rally was organised by the people of Mombasa but that which is recognised will be at Masai grounds," said Boga.The Kombani event is said to have been organised by Dori and several other leaders from the county."Raila will pass by Kombani for voter inspection and attend the Ukunda rally get this from me," said Kwale ODM vice chairman Nicholas Zani.He maintained that Raila will attend the Ukunda rally for which they were already mobilising attendants.Noting politicians must not disrupt learning, Zani said the school rally was unjustified.Philip Etale ODM director of communications said Raila will be at Kombani.In his tour of Kilifi on Tuesday, Raila found out that the IEBC had registered a second person as a voter using his ID number.The opposition chief asked the commission to stop its "mischief" and reiterated that he will accept the results of a rigged poll.Read: Stop the mischief, Raila tells IEBC after 2nd person found with his ID number[VIDEO] Raila heads for Coast to counter Uhuru
