The first Senate since the mid-1960s has held an eminently dignified debate, complete with public participation televised live in a number of daylong special sittings, on the contentious subject of amending the election laws.The 11th Parliament&rsquo;s MPs considered the same matter in two chaotic special sittings that failed to include public input.Today the Senate tables its report on the Election Laws (Amendments) 2016 Act and Kenyans await its recommendations keenly.Stability and the economy stand to suffer if the senators deliver a verdict that is anything but a solution largely acceptable to all Kenyans.This will be no mean feat. The Senate&rsquo;s solution needs to be a hybrid wonder that addresses the concerns of both proponents of digitised election registration, tallying and transmission of results and of hardcopy backups.Today&rsquo;s historic decision needs to be one that enables the majority of Kenyans to go into the election comfortable about the integrity of its management, administration and conduct.Nothing less will do.
