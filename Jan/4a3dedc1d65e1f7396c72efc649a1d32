The Anglican Church has urged doctors to end their strike and carry on with dialogue while at work.Archbishop Jackson ole Sapit said the country faces starvation and the electoral process problems, hence another burden would be too much to bear.He addressed hundreds of Christians at the Kitale showground on Sunday during the celebrations to mark 25 years of Bishop Stephen Kewasis&rsquo; service to the church. Sapit (pictured) urged doctors to accept the offer they were given as they continue to negotiate. Doctors have been on strike since December 5, demanding a 300 per cent pay increase.The government has blamed the doctor&rsquo;s union for the health sector crisis, saying the strike is illegal. Last week, government spokesman Eric Kiraithe said the union was offered a good packages, but they refused to stop the strike. &ldquo;The KMPDU has not bothered to respond. The government is prepared to sit with doctors to resolve the matter before the year ends,&rdquo; he said. The government had offered a Sh50, 000 increase for the lowest paid doctors. Sapit reminded doctors that they took an oath to discharge their duties diligently by serving patients&rsquo; interests. He urged them to stick to that call.On Friday last week, the Labour Relations Court declared the strike illegal and ordered them to resume work immediately. The court directed union officials to call off the strike of face a one-month jail term. Doctors maintain they signed a collective bargaining agreement with the government in 2013, but it is yet to be implemented.
