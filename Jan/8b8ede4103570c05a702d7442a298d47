"The Americas and the Middle East maintained the set momentum but showed mixed results across different locations, thereby scoring a (+2%) and (-4%) respectively," Rifai added.Worldwide, more than 1.2 billion people visited various destinations while 6 billion people toured within their borders, in an unprecedented growth of the domestic travel sector. Rifai further said the robust growth in international arrivals maintained a steady upward trajectory, to mark a 3.9% growth, which translates to some 46 million more overnight visitors as compared to the previous year - 2015.
