At least 13 people were killed on Wednesday in Somalia's capital Mogadishu when al Shabaab militants rammed a car bomb into the gate of a hotel and stormed inside, police said."Thirteen people, including forces and civilians, died in two blasts at the hotel. A dozen others were injured," Major Mohamed Ahmed, a police officer, told Reuters, adding that the death toll could rise.Gunfire rang out as fighters entered Dayah Hotel and a second blast shook the area shortly afterwards, police and witnesses said. Several people were injured and taken to hospital, but there were no immediate reports of fatalities."Well-armed mujahideen (fighters) attacked the hotel, and now they are fighting inside the hotel," according to a report by Somalia's Andalus radio, which is linked to al Shabaab.The hotel attack comes a day after four soldiers were killed when al Shabaab militants planted a roadside bomb in a town near Mogadishu.The blast in Afgoye, about 30 km (18 miles) southwest of the capital, took place a day after the al Shabaab group carried out a raid in the same town that was repulsed by government troops, Major Osman Abdulle, a police officer, told Reuters.Al Shabaab, which until 2011 controlled Mogadishu and much of Somalia, often launches bomb and gun attacks in the capital, saying it wants to topple the Western-backed government and impose its strict interpretation of Islam on the nation.In the past two years, a campaign by African Union troops and Somali forces has driven the group out of key urban strongholds, but it remains active from bases in rural areas."Shooting is taking place," Major Ali Hussein, a police officer at the scene, told Reuters, shortly before the second blast that sent journalists and others near the scene scurrying for safety. Some shops nearby were damaged.
