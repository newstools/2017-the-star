A man from Kisii, who was believed to have died in a road accident at Ewaso Nyiro in Narok, on Tuesday appeared one month after his kin thought they had buried him.Vincent Oyugi of Masaba South did not return home after he left his rented house near Narok town in August 2016 to look for a job as a casual labourer at a farm. Oyugi, 29, was believed to have died when a pick-up ferrying vegetables to a nearby market veered off the road and plunged into a furrow.The accident killed three people of which he was reported one of them, and his body was allegedly interred one month ago.However, on Tuesday January 3, 2017, Oyugi shocked his family when he returned home in good health.Elders from Riamakanda village will now have to slaughter a white cock or goat to cleanse him before he is allowed to join the family.It was reported that Oyugi and three other men secured a job at a vegetable farm where the owner contracted them to harvest cabbages.After nearly about 60 days, family members including his mother Eunice Oyugi received information that Vincent was involved in an accident because he failed to return to his house.Speaking in her home, Eunice said that somebody who was at the scene told her that his son was seen boarding the pick-up with three of his colleagues and thus might have been one of the casualties.Following the accident, the family started arrangements for Vincent&rsquo;s burial which they conducted on December 4 last year."We had received information that our son who had left home to Narok to seek for a casual job was involved in accident which claimed his life," Eunice said."We immediately started making arrangements on how to ferry his body from Narok for burial. We managed and buried him on December 4," she added.She said that the family, relatives and friends were shocked when their son returned home at they thought they had conducted his funeral.The mother at the same time said that both the postmortem and identification of the remains was done at the Narok county hospital before the family was given a go-ahead to transport the body home for burial."We transported the body home after the postmortem and identification. No DNA test was conducted to ascertain whether it was Vincent&rsquo;s real body since it was badly damaged," she said.She said that the family followed all the community rites in giving their son the last send-off.Two days after ushering the New Year, Eunice said that Oyugi - who was presumed dead - showed up, thus dismaying not only the family but the whole community.Eunice said that at first she would not believe when her husband called and informed and her that their son was a live saying she was dumbfounded when she heard the news."I remained speechless when my husband called and informed me that our son was alive. I did not believe the person we buried was not our son," she said.Oyugi said that he had been in Narok all that time that he was away from home and was not aware that his family members were looking for him.He however admitted that he was in the pickup before the accident occurred but managed to jump shortly before it rolled.Vincent said that he sustained minor injuries and managed to walk away from the scene, albeit terrified, never to visit the scene again."I did not go back to the scene to know what exactly had transpired. I did not know who among my colleagues had died," Oyugi said. "I was briefed of the details of the accident some time later when I had gone back to my residence. It did not bother me so much. I continued with my work because I have a family to feed," he narrated.The first born, in a family of six, thanked God for sparing him during the accident.Vincent&lsquo;s uncles, Mose Ombeche and Samuel Ombogo said that it was shocking that they buried the wrong body.Area chief Albert Michira, who visited the home, said that the body which was buried has to be exhumed and handed over to the rightful owners."We instructed the family to obtain a court order so that the police can exhume the body for the rightful owners to rebury the same," Michira said.
