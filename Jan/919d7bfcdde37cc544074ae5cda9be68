Water vendors in some parts of Nairobi are increasing prices as residents begin to feel the pain of the water shortage.Although water rationing is yet to take effect in many estates, the Star has established some residents, especially in slums, are already paying more.In Gomongo and parts of Mathare slums, vendors are taking advantage of the shortage to make a killing.&ldquo;We receive water for two or three hours a day. So most have to buy more from hawkers,&rdquo;Gomongo resident Violet Awuor said.She said people used to pay Sh10 for a 20-litre jerrican but since last week, they are parting with Sh30.&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know how the situation will be in the coming days. We&rsquo;re still in January and are already paying Sh20 more,&rdquo;Awuor said.Rationing will be in effect until the start of the long rains in March. A vendor told the Star they have increased the price to consumers because they have to pay more from the supplier, the Nairobi Water and Sewerage Company.Last week, NCWSC corporate affairs manager Mbaruku Vyakweli told the Star the company has closed most water selling points.&ldquo;We have licensed specific vendors buying directly from us, so quality isn&rsquo;t a problem,&rdquo; he said.However, Health CEC Bernard Muia urged residents to either boil or treat the water they buy from vendors, especially for drinking. Quality cannot be assured, he said.Rationing started on January 1, a week after the NCWSC announced falling water levels in Ndakaini Dam, the main reservoir.Managing director Philip Gichuki said the dam, which supplies 85 per cent of the city&rsquo;s water, is 40 per cent full, translating to an &ldquo;alarming&rdquo; 33 million cubic metres ( 33 billion litres). This was caused by the prolonged dry spell in the Aberdares, Kikuyu and Mt Kenya areas.
