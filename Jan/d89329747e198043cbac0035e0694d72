The former head of MI6 has slapped down Commons Speaker John Bercow&rsquo;s clamour for electronic voting, warning the system would be at risk of cyber attacks.Sir John Sawers, who led Britain&rsquo;s foreign intelligence network between 2009 and 2014, said that voting on a ballot paper with a "stubby pencil" was much more secure.In a stark warning to supporters of electronic voting, including Bercow who has set up his own commission on digital democracy, Sir John said: "The more things that go online, the more susceptible you are to cyber attacks."The only trouble is, the younger generation of people expect to be able to do things remotely and through electronic devices."Bizarrely, the stubby pencil and piece of paper that you put your cross on in the ballot box is actually much more secure than anything which is electronic."Speaking to Radio 4 documentary The New World, Sir John also likened the emergence of electronic democracy to the early days of nuclear weapons.He said: "One of the big problems we face with cyber is that it hasn&rsquo;t really been discussed internationally about what is an acceptable use of cyber powers and where are the red lines and what happens when those red lines are crossed. We&rsquo;re at a very early stage. It&rsquo;s a bit like with nuclear weapons back in the 1950s."We&rsquo;ve got the capabilities, but there are no rules lined up as to how they should be used."His caution comes after the US government accused Russia of interfering with the American presidential election by hacking into emails of leading Democrats.Bercow has previously suggested online voting should be an option by 2020.
