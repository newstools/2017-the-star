Reports that ODM has preferred candidates for elective seats in the region led to the jeering during Raila Odinga&rsquo;s speech in Changamwe on Wednesday.The ODM leader, who was winding up his two-day visit of the Coast, was forced to cut short his speech several times as rowdy youths kept on surging towards the dais.Youths believed to be supporters of two aspirants, Omar Mwinyi (Changamwe MP) and football administrator Ally Goshi almost clashed during the rally.Mwinyi and Goshi are both seeking the ODM ticket for the Changamwe seat.Goshi is said to have blessings from Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho, while Mwinyi is close to Raila. Both Joho and Raila have denied favouring any candidate, saying the party nominations will be free and fair.Youths supporting Goshi are said to have been expressing displeasure that Raila was allegedly favouring Mwinyi.ODM has denied reports that Raila was heckled, saying that youths supporting different aspirants were cheering their candidates, who had accompanied Raila to Changamwe.Reports had also emerged that several youths were arrested, but Mombasa police commander Peterson Maelo denied the allegations.Joho, through his director of communications Richard Chacha, said, &ldquo;The heckling had nothing to do with Raila or Joho.&rdquo;&ldquo;Those were two rival groups. One group was showing displeasure that the person they dislike was standing next to Raila,&rdquo; Chacha said.Unconfirmed reports said Mwinyi has fallen out with Joho for fronting Goshi to take over from him.Mwinyi is now said to be looking for an alternative party if he misses out on the ODM ticket. But he has denied the claims, saying he is in ODM to stay.&ldquo;The youth had come to support their leaders, which is allowed, but it was unfortunate they got so rowdy and could not be controlled,&rdquo; Mwinyi told the Star on the phone.&ldquo;ODM is a democratic party and the primaries will be free, fair and transparent. No one will be rigged out in the nominations.&rdquo;Goshi could not be reached for comment as calls went unanswered.It has also been confirmed a third group of Wiper aspirant Peterson Mitau was in Changamwe to heckle Mwinyi, accusing him of failing his constituents.&ldquo;The Changamwe residents are tired with Mwinyi&rsquo;s leadership. That is why youth heckled him in my favour. They are calling for leadership change in this region,&rdquo; Mitau told the Star on the phone.Mwinyi said the youth were only complaining about the missed employment opportunities.&ldquo;They had come from as far as Jomvu and Miritini. They were complaining to our party leader on how Jubilee has failed to help them in getting employment,&rdquo; he said.During the Changamwe rally, Joho threatened to evict the rowdy youth."We are here because of none other than Raila. We understand there are so many people looking for elective seats, but today's meeting is solely for our party leader," the governor said.Raila had earlier on tried to call for calmness, but failed.The security guards had a rough time trying to control the crowd."Bring down those banners and posters, even that one bearing my photo, you need to be quite and listen," a visibly angry Raila said.Afterwards, Raila assured residents the primaries will be fair and transparent.&ldquo;No one has a direct ticket in ODM. We will go for nominations and in case of a complaint, we will call for the repeat of the whole exercise, until we come to an agreement,&rdquo; the ODM leader said.Speaking at Tudor matatu stage, before heading to Changamwe, Raila unveiled a team led by Joho and Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi, saying it will spearhead the ODM agenda at the coast.The team called &lsquo;ODM Coast Combine&rsquo; will see all elected leaders, calling for voter registration in their respective regions to ensure residents register as voters in large numbers.
