Ukambani leaders have urged the government to swiftly investigate the killing of businessman and politician Steve Muthoka.The businessman was shot dead on December 26 in Buru Buru estate, Nairobi. He was buried on Tuesday at his rural home in Tulimani village.Before his death, Muthoka had declared interest for the Mavoko parliamentary seat. He unsuccessfully vied for the seat in 2013.Speaking during the burial, CCU leader Wavinya Ndeti urged police to ensure those involved in the killing are brought to book.She said police should explore all the possibilities that led to the killing, ranging from politics and business rivalry to ensure the truth is unearthed. &ldquo;As of now, we cannot rule out the possibility that Muthoka&rsquo;s killing may have been due to politics. That&rsquo;s why we want police to ensure the truth is brought to light,&rdquo; Wavinya said.Mitaboni businessman Lawrence Ngovi asked the government to guarantee security for all aspirants, especially during the campaigns. &ldquo;This shows the government has relaxed in protecting its people. It means people vying for political seats are not secure,&rdquo; he said. Ngovi urged the government to recruit more officers during the electioneering period to improve the ratio of police to that of citizens.Machakos Deputy Governor Bernard Kiala said before his death, Muthoka had planned to decamp to Wiper from CCU. &ldquo;When I last spoke with Muthoka, we were planning to have a roadshow from Kyumbi all the way to Mlolongo on January 10. During the rally Muthoka was to announce his decision to join Wiper,&rdquo; he said.
