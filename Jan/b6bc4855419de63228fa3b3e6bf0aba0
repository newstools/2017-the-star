British American Tobacco has agreed to a $49.4 billion (about Sh5.13 trillion) takeover of US rival Reynolds American Inc, creating the world&rsquo;s biggest listed tobacco company after it increased an earlier offer by more than $2 billion (about Sh207.86 billion).BAT, which already owned 42 per cent of Reynolds, will pay $29.44 (about Sh3,058.8) in cash and 0.5260 BAT shares for each Reynolds share, it said, a 26 per cent premium over the price of the stock on October 20, the day before BAT&rsquo;s first offer was made public. Reynolds, the maker of Camel and Newport cigarettes, rejected the approach a month later, according to sources, although the two sides remained in talks.The deal, which values the whole of Reynolds at around $86 billion (Sh8.9 trillion), will mark the return of BAT to the lucrative and highly regulated US market after a 12-year absence, making it the only tobacco giant with a leading presence in American and international markets. BAT chief executive Nicandro Durante said bringing the two companies together will create a market leader with brands including Newport, Lucky Strike, Camel and Pall Mall.&ldquo;It will create a stronger, global tobacco and NGP (next generation products) business with direct access for our products across the most attractive markets in the world,&rdquo; he said on Tuesday.Analysts have said the takeover could spark further deals as Philip Morris International and Japan Tobacco jostle for market share in the industry.
