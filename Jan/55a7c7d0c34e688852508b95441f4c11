Cord leader Raila Odinga has asked the IEBC to stop its "mischief" after finding a second person registered using his ID number.Raila said he realised this when he went to register at a polling station in Mtwapa, Kilifi county, on Tuesday."During the exercise, I once again found that my national identity card had been used to register somebody else as a voter," said the opposition leader."This is exactly the kind of mischief that we have been opposing in the run-up to the election."The Cord leader said the list of voters needs a thorough bio-metric audit by a credible firm with a proven track record.Raila first reported double registration last Thursday, hours after the Interior ministry said Kalonzo Musyoka lied about a similar occurrence.He said IEBC clerks at Gusii Municipal Centre found his ID was registered to a woman by the name Maria Anyango."This is the same approach Jubilee used to manipulate the 2013 polls," he said.Cord leader Raila Odinga and other leadings in the coalition during their visit to an IEBC voter registration centre in Mtwapa, Kilifi county, January 24, 2017. /COURTESYBut despite the realisation, Raila reiterated that he will not go to his supporters claiming his victory has been stolen again after the election.Read more: Raila reports double registration but says he will not complain again of riggingKalonzo, who is Wper leader, Musyoka found that he had been sharing his ID number with a 23-year-old woman.
