The Universities Academic Staff Union says lecturers will skip work from tomorrow to push for better pay.UASU says it wants the lowest paid academic staff member to earn about Sh360,000, while full professors should be paid Sh1.5 million before tax.Secretary Jack Abok, a Moi University professor, said they also want restructured and harmonised terms of employment in the public service.Lecturers want the Inter-Public Universities Forum to implement their demands.They urged students and parents to support the strike.He said lecturers in Botswana, South Africa and Rwanda earn far better than those in Kenya.&ldquo;Our demands are extremely reasonable and we know the economy can sustain them,&rdquo; Abok said.He said universities have been mistreating lecturers, causing most of them to seek greener pastures in foreign countries.Abok said they also want better allowances and other benefits.Many students graduating from the universities earn better than the lecturers, he said.The Moi University chapter of the union met in Eldoret and endorsed the strike.The Kenya Union of Domestic, Hotels, Education Institutions and Allied Workers&rsquo; Union had also issued a strike notice but suspended it following a January 9 order from Employment and Labour Relations Court judge Hellen Wasilwa.Kudheiha secretary general Albert Njeru urged its members in public universities to resume duty until the case is determined.
