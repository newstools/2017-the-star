Kisii Senator Chris Obure has said he authorised nominated Senator Hosea Ochwang'i to vote on his behalf on Thursday night when the Senate voted on the controversial election laws.Obure dismissed as baseless claims by Cord senators that Ochwang'i produced a fake letter to vote on behalf of the Kisii county delegation."I authorised Ochwang'i to case a vote specifically on the Election Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2015. My conscience was clear then and is clear now," he said on Friday.Obure said he wrote to the Speaker with clear instructions on the same.More on this: Senate backs controversial vote methodHe said he was unable to attend Senate proceedings as he had two patients who required emergency services."I woke up on Thursday and prepared myself to attend the crucial sitting before I received calls that two patients from my county wanted my assistance. One was in a coma, while another had heart complications."I rushed to hospital to save the two lives but unfortunately we lost them last night," Obure told the Star.Obure said he stayed in hospital until 7.30pm, which was when the Senate was taking a vote on the laws.He said in October, 2016 he had designated nominated Senator Janet Ong'era on his behalf but stated Ochwang'i's assignment was on a specific matter, which he was supposed to vote on."As the leader of the Kisii delegation I can pick whoever between Ong'era and Ochwang'i to vote in my absence because they are all members of the Kisii delegation," he said.Asked whether he instructed Ochawang'i, who is a Jubilee senator, to vote for the bill, Obure said he was free to vote his conscience."As we speak, I have not met the Senator. But he was at liberty to make a decision, given the circumstances at hand," Obure said.Records indicate that Obure was among 24 voters who passed the contentious Bill during the second reading. The opposition garnered 19 votes against it.ODM smear campaignObure claimed that ODM has consistently been pushing him out of the party ever since he joined other elected leaders from Kisii county in a meeting with President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto at State House last year.He said shortly after, a section of ODM leaders started a smear campaign against him, followed by well-orchestrated events that sought to lock him out of party activities.More on this: Kisii Senator Obure ditches ODM for JubileeRead: 80% of Kisiis will vote for ODM despite Uhuru carrots &ndash; Raila"A meeting was convened in Kisii and touts assembled as delegates to conduct branch elections to replace me as the chairman of the county coordinating committee of ODM."This was in disregard to the party constitution but nobody, including the party leader, raised the red flag on this coup," Obure said.Obure who was instrumental in the marketing of the ODM party in Kisii region appeared to single out Ong'era and Governor James Ongwae of hatching a plot to isolate him from party affairs."Nobody had ever called me to seek any clarification on what we went to do at State House. They decided to brand me a tumbocrat and said nasty things about me."It was so bad and embarrassing to me and my family that at my age I can be said to be going to get handouts from State House," he added.Obure said despite his efforts to set up a meeting with ODM leader Raila Odinga to explain to the issues, Raila has been elusive."He doesn't pick my calls, he said he was to meet me on some Tuesday last year but up to now he has never called me," he said.The Senator said ODM continues to deduct his monthly contributions."I have not resigned from the party but ODM has gone ahead and installed new branch officials among them defectors from other parties in disregard to the party constitution," he said.
