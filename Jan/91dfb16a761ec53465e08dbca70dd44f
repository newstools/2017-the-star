A Maua court has acquitted a married couple that has been facing robbery with violence and murder charges. Chief magistrate Samuel Soita on Friday said he was not convinced by the evidence presented that Purity Mukethi and Jackson Matheta committed the crimes. They&rsquo;ve been in remand since April, 2014.
