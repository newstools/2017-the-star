A KCSE candidate who scored a B in the 2016 exams has disputed his results saying he was supposed to have received an A.Msuo Abubakar from Aga Khan High School, Mombasa said he cried upon learning that he missed the A following what he termed as mistakes in marking.He said the short period given to markers by Education CS Fred Matiang'i may have contributed to the error in his grade."I cried not because I failed but because my targeted results did not come. I had prepared well but the outcome did not satisfy me," the 18-year-old said.Read: 17-year-old attempts suicide after failing to score 'A' grade"I expected an A in all subjects except Maths. I used to work extra hard in school, going for tuition after classes until late in the night," he added.Abubakar scored a C+ in English, B- in Kiswahili, D in Maths, A in IRE and History and B in Biology, Chemistry and Business Studies.He said the exams he normally did at school were much more difficult and he found this year's KCSE exams easier, which made him wonder how he got a B.His ambition is to study Law and he wanted to join university with nothing below an A."If I meet Matiang'i today I will tell him that am not happy with the results; my school is also not happy," he said.He said he is not opposed to Matiang'i's rules, but feels markers should have been given more time to mark well.More on this: KOT crack jokes about Matiang'i after early release of KCSE 2016 resultsRead: KCSE 2016 results: Only 141 As from over 88,900 candidates with C+ and aboveAbubakar's parents had a difficult time consoling him when the results were released last Friday.His father Abubakar Msuo said he was also disappointed after seeing the results of his son.&ldquo;We had prepared people for a big party to honor this rural boy from Lamu but the results did not come as expected,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said.Read: KCSE 2016 results: Over 183,200 candidates to miss university slots after scoring 'D-', 'E'Also read: Joining university was 'beyond wildest dreams' for father of four who scored 'C+'
