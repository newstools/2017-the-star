A teenager could have hacked the Hillary Clinton campaign&rsquo;s emails because security was so lax that the password used by one key member was &lsquo;password&rsquo;, it was claimed yesterday.WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange insisted Russia had no involvement in hacking around 50,000 damaging emails that were leaked to his website.Assange said a 14-year-old could have accessed the accounts of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta because he used the password &lsquo;password&rsquo;.He denied CIA claims that Vladimir Putin ordered the hacking to help Donald Trump win the presidency, adding that Clinton made "almost no attempt" to secure private emails.The US State Department insists it is "100 per cent certain" that Russia was behind the hacking campaign that some Democrats blamed for Clinton&rsquo;s defeat.President Obama has expelled 35 Russians over the scandal. But Mr Trump used Assange&rsquo;s claims to step up his attacks over the hacking row, asking on Twitter why the Democrats had been "so careless".
