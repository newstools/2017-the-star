Kenyans on Thursday took on Labour Court judge Hellen Wasilwa after she ordered doctors to end their strike and resume duty.Through a Twitter hashtag #StinkingDoctor, Kenyans accused the judge for comparing the medics to a stinking sewage.In her ruling, Wasilwa gave the doctors a two-week window period to finalise negotiations to end the strike or face a month jail term.The agitated Judge accused doctors off 'adamantly refusing' to end the strike."You are all talking about a CBA. There is no CBA... I have not registered any CBA because it is not registered," she said.Noting her duty&nbsp;was to protect the people's lives, Wasilwa said she cannot allow doctors to let people die because of their demands.However in her ruling remarks, Wasilwa compared the doctors to a stinking sewage which Kenyans on twitter did not take lightly."If you are leaders who cannot control your members then you should not be officials of the union. You are elected to represent&nbsp; and speak for them. As long as you are dirty, your clients are dirty. They are stinking of sewage. They cannot come before this court and seek other orders. A contempt is same as stinking sewage," the judge said.Read: [VIDEO] Court orders doctors' officials to call off strike or face one month jailIt is this comment that outraged Kenyans on Twitter who supported the doctors and the judges in equal measure.User by the name Samson said: "When u work, u get dirty. #StinkingDoctors accept to be in the sewage till we implement CBA,"Winnie Mwebia said: "The #stinkingdoctors deal with worse hospital smells from ailing patients daily and still treat with the dignity deserved,"Ochola Felix said: "Judge Wasilwa should know the only stinking sewage is a kangaroo judiciary which nobody trusts,"Samson Misango said: "The ruling by judge Wasilwa is an arm twisting by a compromised judiciary and a disgrace to our constitution,"The doctors' union officials however trashed Wasilwa's directive and said they were not scared to serving a jail term.KMPDU's Ouma Oluga said they would take their services to court if that what so the government wished.Read:&nbsp;Kenya to hire skilled, cheaper and jobless doctors from India, CubaAlso read:&nbsp;Inside the striking doctors&rsquo; 2013 collective bargaining agreement&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
