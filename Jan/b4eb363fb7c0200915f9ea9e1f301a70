The High Court has declined to issue interim orders compelling Mbita MP Millie Odhiambo to apologise to President Uhuru Kenyatta for a verbal attack.Millie will also not apologise to Kenyans for saying in Parliament in December that Uhuru is a "fake" president.Justice John Mativo said all the parties in the case needed more time to respond."Accordingly I find that this is not proper to grant interim orders as sought," he ruled on Thursday.The court also declined to stop the MP, her agents, servants and any other restrained people, from uttering derogatory words against the President.Philip Njuguna wanted the MP compelled to issue an apology to the public, though mass media, in a manner and terms approved by the court.Through lawyer Harrison Kinyanjui, Njuguna argued that Millie was mandated with upholding, protecting and defending the constitution, but said she had not done so.The Kandara parliamentary seat aspirant also said the MP violated her parliamentary privileges and immunity.Njuguna accused the MP of unfairly criticisng and insulting the Presidency in flagrant violation of Article 131(1) (e) of the constitution, which states the President is a symbol of unity.He further told the court the words Millie uttered demeaned her oath of public office.Mativo asked the Attorney General and Millie to file and serve their responses ahead of a January 24 court appearance.Millie sought anticipatory bail in December saying she was traumatised and was undergoing psychological torture following threats by both police officers and unknown people."I am living in fear of imminent arrest on an unspecified, and state charges that I have no knowledge or information of whatsoever," she said.She later obtained orders stopping police from arresting her.Read: I'm scared, threatened, need advance bail, says MP MillieAlso read: Police barred from arresting Millie Odhiambo over 'fake President' remarks
