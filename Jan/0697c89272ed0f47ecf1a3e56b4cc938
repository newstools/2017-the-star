Facebook hasintroduced a security measure that allows account holders to use a physical key to access their social network profile. The FIDO U2F security key is plugged into the USB port on a computer and is tapped to confirm login, alongside a password.Once the key is activated through Facebook's security setting, the key and password are needed to log in through a set up known as two-factor authentication. The two-step verification requires two of three things from a user seeking access to their account.These are a password, a separate four-digit one-time code or the long access key given to the user when they first signed up for site use.The key will block anyone without a security key and password from accessing another's Facebook account using another device.The social network's security team has previously estimated that around 0.06 per cent of Facebook accounts, an equivalent of about 600,000 profiles, are compromised daily.Complaints following the hacking of accounts include the posting of porn videos or images that do not reflect a user's personality.Among security features Facebook has introduced is Messenger's encrypted messages that prevent anyone from snooping on private chats.The 'Secret Conversations' feature was first announced by the social media firm in July last year but took several months to test and roll out.The addition of end-to-end encryption means that no one - including the government - will be able to access the hidden messages.More on this: Facebook users can now have self-destructing 'secret conversations' in MessengerAlso read: Facebook hosts first global roundtable on women's safety in Kenya
