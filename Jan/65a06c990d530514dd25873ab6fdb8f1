Kenya Ports Authority women&rsquo;s team humiliated Cooperative Bank 58-38 to cruise into the final of the National Classic League playoffs in Mombasa over the weekend.But despite the win in Game Three of best of five series at the KPA Makande gymnasium, the dockers were under strength with regional championship MVP Seline Okumu and inspirational Betty Kananu missing due to different commitment. Irene Munyanya, usually used as a reserve player, started her first game and never disappointed, nailing three from beyond the arch. She scored one in the first quarter and two in the fourth, to put the game beyond Cooperative Bank&rsquo;s reach. KPA took a 17-08 first quarter lead before extending it to 17-11 in the second for a 34-19 half-time lead.The visitors came to life in the third quarter, outscoring the dockers 15-06 to cut the 15-points cushion for the KPA to six by the end of the third quarter. However, a change of tact by the dockers in the fourth quarter saw them outscore their opponents 18-05 for the comfortable win. Natalie Akinyi top-scored for KPA with 12 points while Felmas Adhiambo had 10. Celia Asila was the toast for Co-op with 10 while Belinda Okoth managed six.KPA women won the series 3-0 and will now wait for the winner between Equity Bank and United States International University to know their opponents in the final.&ldquo;We played very badly and could not make meaningful plays on both ends of the court thus allowing the dockers a chance to dominate,&rdquo; said Co-op bank coach Caroline Ouma. Her KPA counterpart Anthony Ojukwu praised his players for coming out strongly even in the absence of key players and dedicated the win to Okumu and Kananu.
