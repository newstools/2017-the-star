Residents of West Karachuonyo, Homa Bay county have petitioned Water CS Eugene Wamalwa over a stalled Sh9.5million water project in the area.They want the CS to explain why the project has not been completed since it was commissioned in 2014.The project was to be implemented by the Lake Victoria South Water Services Board (LVSWSB).John Opondo, who led more than 200 residents, said the project's failure to take off has seen them suffer especially in the face of the current drought situation.The group wants Wamalwa to visit the project site and explain to them why it has stalled or else they will move to court over the same.&ldquo;We also want EACC to probe our suspicion that the project's funds could have been embezzled,&rdquo; Opondo said on Friday.The allegations have put the water board on spot after it also emerged that a pump to be used in the project has not been delivered to the site.Eng Sammy Mburu, LVSWSB chief manager technical services, said the pump has been delivered.But a letter dated December 5, 2016 by LVSWSB CEO Petronila Ogut stated that that the Low Lift pump paid for in 2014 had not been delivered on site.In the letter, Ogut states that reconciliation of payments against works done indicated that the board has paid Sh9,477,875 for works not undertaken.&ldquo;The payments included sections of the intake works, raw water intake, main treatment works, pumps/accessories and back wash tanks,&rdquo; the letter reads in part.In this regard, the Audit and Risk Committee of the board has told Mburu to justify the payments arguing the said works are yet to be done. The committee also wants answers on the anticipated risks or losses of government resources and what mitigation measures are in place to safeguard the same.Ogut queried the officers involved in the project and their roles in the preparation of the payments in question.The risk committee further told Mburu to explain why he provided contrary information to the board's strategy, technical and business development committee. Mburu did not pick calls or reply text messages on the claims of financial impropriety as well as on project status when the Star contacted him. However, LVSWSB chairman Amb John Koech said plans are underway to revive the project to benefit the people of West Karachuonyo.He told the Star on the phone that the project has stalled due to some issues, but declined to reveal the same. Koech said the board is focused on ensuring public resources are spent prudently on the intended project. &ldquo;We cannot resolve the problems at the board at once but we are on course to see all stalled projects are completed,&rdquo; he said. Koech said the board is transparent and accountable and that not a single cent of public funds will be misused.He added that the board has directed officers in charge of the projects to ensure the completion of the projects for the benefits of Kenyans.Board director Rosemary Mumo said the project is on course and will be completed. She acknowledged that it had stalled because of some issues, but also did not divulge more details.&ldquo;The project had stalled and I cannot discuss those issues on phone,&rdquo; Mumo said.
