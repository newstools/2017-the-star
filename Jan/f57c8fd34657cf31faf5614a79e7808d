Lugari MP Ayub Savula yesterday asked Mombasa Governor and ODM deputy party leader Hassan Joho to respect the presidency. He said although the opposition wants to remove Jubilee from power, it is important for leaders to respect each other. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t need to raise political temperatures. We should focus our campaigns on ideologies and policies,&rdquo; he said. He was reacting to remarks by Joho in Mombasa on Thursday when he told President Uhuru Kenyatta to stop bragging about projects started by the grand coalition government of President Mwai Kibaki and Prime Minister Raila Odinga. &ldquo;We know the history of this project. In was started in 2010, under the Kenya municipal programme, when Jubilee was not in government. So we want to see projects that have been done by the Jubilee administration,&rdquo; Joho said. &ldquo;You may not like the occupant of the office of the President but it is important to respect the presidency as an institution,&rdquo; Savula said.
