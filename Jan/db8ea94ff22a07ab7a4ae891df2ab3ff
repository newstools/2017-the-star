State House spokesperson Manoah Esipisu has watered down Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho's claims that the government is boasting about projects funded by others.He said the government has pumped billions of shillings to undertake various development projects with the Coast Region."Jubilee's development credentials in the region are clear for everyone to see and no amount of juvenile tantrums from any quarters would negate the improved service delivery to the Coastal region," he said on Sunday.Esipisu made the remarks after Joho and Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi dressed down President Uhuru Kenyatta for "hijacking" projects in the region.Uhuru, who officially opened the bridge on Thursday, boasted about his government's allocation of large amounts of money to Coast counties, Mombasa in particular"Over Sh600 million has been used to build this foot bridge. Foot paths and slums at the Coast will be upgraded at a cost of Sh3.2 billion," he said without specifying the source of funds.But Joho, who spoke in Bamburi while Uhuru watched, said the money for the bridge was donated by World Bank."I know the history of this project. It started in 2010 way before Jubilee came to power," he said.[VIDEO] Joho lectures Uhuru on hijacking Mombasa projectsBut Esipisu said the government has put billions of shillings to fund improved security, healthcare, roads, markets, electricity to homes and schools in efforts whose fruits people were already reaping.A day after Joho and Kingi made their remarks, their security was withdrawn, prompting sharp responses from the opposition.More on this: ODM leaders ask Nkaissery to reinstate Joho, Kingi security detailAlso read: No more police chase cars for governors - BoinnetEsipisu denied claims that the withdrawal was politically motivated, saying the move was part of restructuring and reorganisation of regional security operations."My understanding is that regional commands within Mombasa and Kilifi are reorganising themselves. The important thing is that there is no political motive in operational matters within the police, it is up to various commands to make decisions they deem fit response to the emerging issues within their jurisdiction," he said.Esipisu said that reorganisations do happen across the country all the time and Joho and Kingi's case was not an exception."Local commands make local decisions, let us not always jump into conclusion that a certain matter has to be attached to an occurrence," he said.At least four body guards attached to the two governors have been withdraw under unclear circumstances by the government.
