Samburu leaders want the ongoing mass voter registration extended for another month in drought hit areas across the country.They asked the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) to do so to allow pastoralist communities get listed.The leaders said most of the residents of these areas are always on the move hence difficult to reach within the 30-day period.Samburu West MP Lati Lelelit said it is unfair to group pastoral counties at the same level with the rest of Kenyans."Residents of these areas are always on the move. We have to trace and bring them home to register ahead of the deadline," he said."I will raise the issue of the extension for Northern Kenya counties in Parliament on Tuesday," the MP said on Friday. Lelelit said that most of the community members have migrated to Marsabit, Nyeri and Laikipia counties in search for pasture.IEBC kicked of the mass listing on January 16 and will close the same on February 14, dates the community leaders say is not sufficient.Lelelit urged leaders from across the country to support them in the push for the deadline to be revised to March 14."We will have reached the set targets within the period," he said, adding that the low turn out in the regions is alarming.Ndoto MCA Raisy Letura asked IEBC to introduce mobile registration centres in the county to help deal with the difficulties. "Let them increase the number of staff apart from extending the registration period. Only 1500 out of 7,000 have been reached," Letura said. The leaders joined their counterparts from the arid and semi-arid areas who have also sought the extension.Fafi MP Barre Shill said: "Why is voter registration done when there is drought and hunger? We are starving and thirsty,""We need food, water and medicine to be distributed to Marsabit, Turkana, Mandera, Garissa, Wajir, Baringo counties. We cannot register and vote when we are dead," he told the media at Parliament Buildings on Thursday.Read: Shill urges IEBC to extend voter listing for pastoralists by one month due to drought
