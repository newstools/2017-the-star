Water Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa has urged Nairobi residents use water sparingly following the prolonged drought that has hurt supplies to the city.He asked residents to employ measures to enable them use the commodity sparingly before the onset of the season of long rains in April."My appeal to all Kenyans is that they should not waste even one drop of water. Let us recycle where applicable," the CS said.Wamalwa further warned cartels, taking advantage of the current shortages to exploit residents, of dire consequences when they will be exposed."The government is working to ensure it curbs the persistent shortages and mitigate the effects of the prolonged drought," Wamalwa told members of the press.He cited the ongoing construction of the Northern Collector Tunnel in Muranga as among interventions that will ensure the problem is sorted.Nairobi Water and Sewerage Company has reported that the drought has seen water levels in Ndakaini Dam drop to less than half its capacity.The firm said that the 70 million meters cubic storage is currently 40 per cent full, termed the situation as 'alarming' hence the need for water rationing.Read: Water rations for Nairobi from January-April as Ndakaini levels dropThe CS hit at the opposition for politicising the ongoing water projects, further defending the same as in line with the Vision 2030.Nairobi water CEC Peter Kimori said supplies to vital institutions such as Airports and Hospitals will continue uninterrupted.He reiterated the need for the development and implementation of ground water projects in the county, citing a Sh200 million plan for the venture.
