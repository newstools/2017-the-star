Presidential hopeful Kennedy Mong&rsquo;are has urged retired ACK Archbishop Eliud Wabukala to decline his appointment as anti-graft czar.He warned the man of the cloth that he risks being caught up in the intricate corruption networks at Integrity Centre, ruining his otherwise illustrious religious career.Using biblical allusion from Mathew 4, Mong'are likened Jubilee to Satan, who took Jesus Christ on top of a mountain, showed him earthly wealth and promised all would be his if he worshipped him.&ldquo;Wabukala has done the biggest mistake of his life. He has served this country for more than 50 years as a man of God. He is heading to EACC without any background in law or finance. The perpetrators of corruption who have encroached the commission will soil his name,&rdquo; he said.The Nyamira senator was addressing the press at Parliament Buildings on Tuesday hours after the National Assembly approved the 66-year old cleric as chairman of the Ethics and Anti-corruption Commission.Mong'are said Wabukala&rsquo;s appointment is a strategy by the ruling Jubilee to "baptise, sanitise and glorify" massive corruption depleting the country. It is projected that Kenyans lose up to Sh300 billion annually through corruption.&ldquo;Wabukala is being taken to the guillotine to be beheaded. He has served this country well and preserved his name as a man of God, but where he is going cartels will finish him,&rdquo; the senator said.In the event the retired archbishop does not voluntarily turn down his approval by Parliament, Mong&rsquo;are urged President Uhuru Kenyatta not to formally appoint him to the helm of the EACC.&ldquo;The President should utilise even the iota of time left to decline to appoint him to save the old man from embarrassment,&rdquo; he said.While approving the clergy MPs had hailed praise on the man of God as the ultimate panacea to slaying the dragon of corruption.At the same time Monga&rsquo;re fired a barrage of criticism at the President over the massive police hardware launched on Monday at Uhuru Park, &lsquo;as if the country is at war when patients are dying in hospitals.&rsquo;&rsquo;&ldquo;Kenyans cannot afford medical care and the President is bragging around launching police hardware whose quality and standards are in doubt considering the country of origin,&rdquo; he said.
