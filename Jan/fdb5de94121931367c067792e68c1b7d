The West Pokot National Drought Management Authority has said the drought situation in North Pokot and Central Pokot subcounties is worsening.County drought coordinator Gabriel Mbogho said the proportion of children at risk of malnutrition has risen to 69 per cent.&ldquo;The drought situation in the county is worsening as the months go by,&rdquo; he said. Mbogho said the children at risk of malnutrition have risen to 12.2 per cent from nine per cent in November last year. He attributed this to the reduced milk consumption, coupled with lack of health outreach services in some areas."The condition of cattle and sheep is poor. There is need for livestock supplements,&rdquo; Mbogho saidThe pasture is completely depleted in areas along the pastoral and agro-pastoral zones of Masol, Orwa, Kacheliba, Kapchok, Losam, Korpu, Kiwawa, Kasei and Alale.Accessibility of pasture has been hindered by conflicts along the Pokot, Marakwet and Turkana borders.He said cattle diseases have been recorded on the Pokot-Uganda border."Seventy-five per cent of livestock have migrated to Uganda with a number of cattle deaths being reported in Pokot North and Central," Mbogho said.He said residents are forced to walk for more than 10km to fetch water.&ldquo;In comparison to the preceding month, the water situation has declined with most water pans in the pastoral zone drying up. The water level in natural rivers along the agro-pastoral zone is dropping,&rdquo; Mbogho saidThe remaining open water sources used by the communities are expected to last for only two weeks.&ldquo;We are monitoring the situation," he said.Area leaders have urged the government to supply relief food to schools."The government should consider building semi-boarding schools, because when parents migrate they migrate with their schoolgoing children,&rdquo;Kapenguria MP Samuel Moroto said.He said the county had been marginalised for many years.West Pokot Deputy Governor Titus Lotee said the county government bought food the last financial year that had sustained residents until December.He asked politicians to stop using the drought situation as a campaigning tool and instead focus on solutions to feed the hungry.Areas most hit by drought include Masol, Marich, Kacheliba, Kodich Kangoletiang, Kiwawa, Turkwel, Chepkopegh, Nyangaita, Kasses, Konyao, Alale, Sarmach, Suam, Ombolion, Lonyangilem, Kapchok, Lomut, Sekerr and Sigor.
