The Director of Public Prosecutions has appealed against the acquittal of former Foreign Affairs PS Thuita Mwangi and two others in the Tokyo embassy scam.Mwangi and three others were accused of graft in authorising payment in the Sh1.3 billion scandal and it emerged the building was bought at an inflated cost. Kenya lost Sh185.5 million in the purchase.&lsquo;Wrongly acquitted&rsquo;DPP Keriako Tobiko, in his renewed bid to have Mwangi and his co-accused held liable over the illegal purchase of the Kenyan Embassy in Tokyo, says the decision to clear them was wrong and should be reversed.&ldquo;The trial magistrate erred in law in finding that the prosecution had not established a prima facie case against the accused on all counts when it had done so,&rdquo; he says in appeal documents.The DPP said anti-corruption magistrate Kennedy Bidali failed to analyse the evidence brought against the former PS, former charge d&rsquo;affaires at the embassy Allan Mburu and former deputy director of administration in the ministry Anthony Muchiri before ruling that there was insufficient evidence against them.Bidali was wrong to clear the three on counts of conspiracy to commit an offence of corruption and failure to comply with the procurement law, despite making a finding that there were many violations of procurement procedures, he says.Tobiko&rsquo;s assistant Daniel Karori and lawyers representing the three appeared before Justice Hedwig Ong&rsquo;udi of the Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Division of the High Court yesterday. The case will be mentioned for further direction on February 2.Why did judge withdraw from case?The judge directed the DPP to respond to a letter dated March 18, 2016, written to him by Muchiri asking him to investigate the circumstances that made magistrate Doreen Mulekyo withdraw from the case.The magistrate disqualified herself in January 2016, citing &ldquo;unfortunate remarks&rdquo; allegedly made by a prosecutor.Mulekyo said although the prosecutor apologised to the court and the defence team &ldquo;it is my considered view that the matter be put to rest&rdquo;.She concluded, &ldquo;It would, however, appear that the comment has since taken a life of its own and it is no longer tenable for me to continue to hear this matter.&rdquo;Mwangi, Muchiri and Mburu want the DPP to notify them of the results of the investigations. And in the event anyone from the DPP&rsquo;s office is implicated, the three want action to be taken against the person.Tobiko has 14 days to respond to the letter.
