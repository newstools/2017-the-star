China should be congratulated for banning its internal ivory trade, by far the world&rsquo;s largest domestic market. By the end of the year, this comprehensive ban will have stopped all trade in ivory products in China.The Chinese action has come after years of wildlife protection advocacy around the world.What&rsquo;s more, it could have a devastating impact on crimes against wildlife that are crimes against the environment and, ultimately, humanity. Carter Roberts, president of the World Wildlife Fund, commented in a written statement: &ldquo;China&rsquo;s announcement is a game changer for elephant conservation.&rdquo;This comes at a time when, unusually, two rhinos have been killed in Kenya for the first time in a couple of years (see story page 7).China and Vietnam, the world&rsquo;s largest markets for rhino trophies and other products, would do well to ban this brutal trade.In Kenya, meanwhile, given the poaching resurgence, crimes against wildlife should be punished much more severely than is the case at the moment.
