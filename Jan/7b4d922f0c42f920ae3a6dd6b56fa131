Former Kenya Meat Commission employees have protested against the taxation of their early retirement packages.They were laid off in June last year by the parastatal to cut costs.&ldquo;Some taxes were unlawfully levied on our retirement packages. There was a presidential decree protecting our payments from taxation after we took early retirement,&rdquo; spokesman Swale Musa said. They addressed the press in Athi River town on Sunday.Musa said the 119 former employees are being taxed between Sh150,000 and Sh700,000.&ldquo;The KMC board said it would talk to the ministry of Agriculture to ensure we are not taxed, but they failed to honour their promise. &ldquo;Whenever we seek updates, we are told to go back later,&rdquo; he said. KMC officials were unavailable for comment.
