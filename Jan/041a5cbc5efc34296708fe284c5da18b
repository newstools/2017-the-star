Ol Kalou MP David Kiaraho on Thursday dismissed NASA as an inconsequential outfit. He said opposition leaders are a bunch of power-hungry politicians with no agenda. On Wednesday at the Bomas of Kenya, leaders Raila Odinga, Kalonzo Musyoka, Musalia Mudavadi and Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula pledged to remain united. But Kiaraho says their unity does not worry Jubilee because the ruling party is better organised. Kiaraho said no one is opposed to opposition unity, as it&rsquo;s their right to organise. He said the Jubilee administration will not, however, allow any tribal groupings in the guise of a united opposition. The legislator said the next government will be determined by Kenyans, not a few tribes mobilised by a clique for personal gain. He said Kenyans are well aware the opposition leaders were once in government but did nothing. &ldquo;Those power-hungry characters have nothing to offer,&rdquo; Kiaraho said.
