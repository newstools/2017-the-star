Cord leader Raila Odinga has attributed the low turn-out in voter registration in Nyanza region to delayed issuance of ID cards.Raila said a number of youths from the region, who turn up to applyfor the document, have been demoralised as the process is delayed.He argued that the new applicants are forced to queue for long andfail to get their IDs processed timely, what he noted reflected badly on the voter registration.Raila accused the ministry of registrar of persons of applyingselectively President Uhuru Kenyatta's directive of processing IDs in three days."We know what's happening with the registrar of persons office.They delay processing of IDs from areas they consider not favourable to them," Raila said.He told President Uhuru Kenyatta to act firmly on issuance of ID cards to ensure all eligible persons register as voters.&ldquo;Let President act now so our people get equal opportunity to take part in the voters registration process.Most of our youths make long cue looking for ID registration forms in hot sun only to return home disillusioned," he said.Speaking during a consultative meeting on voter mobilisation at Odino in Nyakach constituency on Sunday, Raila expressed displeasure that the region, which is his political backyard had done poorly in terms of registering new voters in the ongoing mass voter drive.The opposition chief at the same time warned local chiefs againstobstructing the process of acquiring IDs, saying they risk facing stern measures."It's a bad show when you see some chiefs still cling on ID formsbecause of their own interests.Stern action will be taken against such chiefs," Raila said.Raila urged the opposition supporters to largely register as voters, reiterating that the leadership of the country is won through numbers.&ldquo;I want you to know that the elections we are going for in going to be determined through this mass voter registration exercise. Therefore, let you not be dragged like sheep to go and register as voters,&rdquo; Raila said.The opposition chief claimed that there was skewed distribution of BVR kits in the last elections in favour of Jubilee that gave them the tyranny of numbers, saying this time round that was fairness hence he is assured of getting more numbers.Raila was accompanied by governors John Nyagarama (Nyamira), Cyprian Awiti (Homa Bay), Jack Ranguma (Kisumu), Okoth Obado (Migori), and ODM national chairman John Mbadi and several MPs from the region.Awiti said they are going to do everything possible to ensure theymeet the IEBC targetof registration."Everybody here has a task to ensure they mobilise residents to register as voters,"Awiti said.
