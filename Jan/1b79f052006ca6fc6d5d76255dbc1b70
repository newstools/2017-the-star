More than 120,000 people face food shortage in Kwale county, according to an assessment by food security agencies. The Kenya Food Security Steering Group and the County Steering Group said Kinango and Lunga lunga subcounties are the most affected. The report says the situation has been worsened by inadequate and delayed rainfall. The National Drought Management Authority said the county is in dire need of food aid to ensure no lives are lost. Speaking in Kwale yesterday, county drought coordinator Roman Sherah said the government has started distributing relief food and water. He said buying livestock from farmers and distributing meat to residents has been recommended.
