Athi River deputy county commissioner Geoffrey
Omoding has called on bar owners and operators to help flash out criminals from
the region. Omoding said bars, pubs, clubs among other social
places in Mlolongo town are used by outlawed Mungiki and Gaza sect groups as
hide outs as they await to execute their criminal activities. “We as Athi River Sub County security committee have
met with bar owners to strategize on how to deal with Mungiki and Gaza sect
groups members and other criminal gangs who seek refuge in their premises,”
said Omoding.
