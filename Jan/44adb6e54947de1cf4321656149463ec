Lawyer Simon Lilan, who went to court to stop former nominated MP Mark Too&rsquo;s burial alleging foul play, now claims his life is in danger. He said he has received threats from unknown people. &ldquo;I have been threatened and forced to live away in hiding by people who have ulterior motives and are busy pushing for the quick burial of Too,&rdquo; Lilan said after the orders were vacated.
