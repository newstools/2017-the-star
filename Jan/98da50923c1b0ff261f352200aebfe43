President Uhuru Kenyatta has suffered a major blow after one of his most trusted, passionate and ardent supporter former TNA secretary general Onyango Oloo defected.Oloo, who is eyeing a parliamentary seat in Kisumu, is set to officially defect to ODM today. He will be received by opposition chief Raila Odinga, leaving only ex-minister Raphael Tuju as Uhuru&rsquo;s point man in Luo-Nyanza.After the Jubilee merger, Uhuru appeared to edge out Oloo after he named Tuju as the head of his Jubilee Party machine, leaving the former powerful secretary general empty-handed.Earlier, Uhuru had sacked Oloo as the chairman of the Lake Basin Development Authority, a position that was also incidentally handed to Tuju.There are allegations that a section of Jubilee leaders have interests in the Sh3 billion LBDA mall coming up on Kisumu&rsquo;s Mamboleo estate.Nyanza MPs have publicly protested an alleged plot to auction the mall to &ldquo;powerful people in the Jubilee government&rdquo;.But Oloo&rsquo;s disgruntlement with the government appears to be linked to failure by Jubilee to give him a high-profile job. He was reportedly promised a Cabinet post after Uhuru rode to power in 2013 and later an ambassadorial appointment to the UK. Both were never to be.&ldquo;Have you ever seen a secretary general of a ruling party who has no job?&rdquo;a close ally of Oloo told the Star yesterday, lifting the lid on Oloo&rsquo;s apparent displeasure.ODM claims that Uhuru has entrenched tribalism in government and is likely to use the Oloo narrative to wage a vicious onslaught against Jubilee. Nearly all those who served with Oloo at the helm of TNA hold plum jobs in government.They include former TNA chairman Johnson Sakaja, who was nominated to the National Assembly and Jasper Mbiuki, ex-TNA secretary for political affairs, who is a special adviser in the presidency. Yesterday Oloo declined to comment. However, he is said to be eyeing the Kisumu Central parliamentary seat, currently held by ODM rebel MP Ken Obura. Oloo is an advocate of the High Court.
