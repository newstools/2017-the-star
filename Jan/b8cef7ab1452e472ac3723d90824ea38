The Western Elders&rsquo; Council has broken ranks with the Luhya Elders&rsquo; Forum over the community&rsquo;s political direction ahead of the August election.The Western Elders&rsquo; Council is made up of 18 subclans of the Luhya, Sabaots and Teso communities.The Luhya Elders&rsquo; Forum has 18 members, representing 18 Luhya subclans. It was formed to champion the community&rsquo;s economic development, but has lately engaged in politics.Council chairman Philip Masinde on Saturday criticised the forum, saying it is &ldquo;amorphous and fake, with imposter officials&rdquo;. &ldquo;Ask them who elected them to office and when. They have even declared themselves life officials,&rdquo; he said. Masinde spoke when ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi was installed the Luhya spokesman in Kakamega&rsquo;s Bukhungu Stadium on Saturday. He was reacting to media reports attributed to the forum&rsquo;s secretary, Peter Ludaava, that Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli has no mandate to name the community&rsquo;s spokesman.Ludaava said Atwoli did not consult all parties and leaders should not be appointed. But Masinde said those opposed to the Luhya spokesman are working for &ldquo;outsiders&rdquo; for selfish political gain. &ldquo;As Western Elders&rsquo; Council, we shall work with Mudavadi,&rdquo; he said.Masinde said Atwoli consulted elders in all the four counties in Western, adding that the process started in 2012.&ldquo;It is foolhardy for one to say Atwoli did not consult. I was involved in the initiative right from the start and met all recognised elders before a scientific study was commissioned,&rdquo; he said.The forum has in the past been accused of extorting money from presidential candidates. It backed Cord leader Raila Odinga in 2013, against Mudavadi. In return, its chairman Patrick Wangamati was nominated to the National Assembly.
