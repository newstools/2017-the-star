There were 14.4 million Kenyans enrolled as voters prior to the last General Election in March 2013.The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) projected 22 million voters by the next election in 2017, if all factors remained constant. The elections will be held on August 8 this year.As of June 30, 2016, a total of 15,857,185 Kenyans had been uploaded in the database, pending verification and certification by the IEBC. We also realised that approximately 9 million people have been issued with National ID cards and are not registered as voters. This meant the second Mass Voter Registration exercise would target to increase the number of voters by 4-6 million.During the second Mass Voter Registration, 7,793 BVR kits will be deployed countrywide at the ward level. The BVRs distribution criteria will be based on geographical area, which was modified from the first Massive Voter Register. The proposal is to have the kits opened at constituency level, to allow registration across the constituency. The kits movement schedule is to be shared with locals while voter transfers will be done at constituency level.To ensure the second Mass Voter Register is successful, we have also invested significantly in Human Resource. The IEBC has recruited over 15,000 employees for the exercise. They included 290 Registration Officers, 290 Assistant Registration Officers, 1,775 Voter Registration Assistants, 580 ICT Support Assistants and 15,586 Clerks.The IEBC is currently training them for the second Mass Voter Registration. They are under several teams. They include the National Training of Trainers, which was completed on 6 January 2017, Second Level Training at the regional level is ongoing and the training of VRAs/Clerks will be completed by 14 January 2017.Other Operational Plans will include; all registration centers shall be gazetted by 13 January 2017, all registration officers shall be gazetted by 13 January 2017, about 300 registration centres will be amended in terms names/location, stakeholder engagements both at the national and county level continue this week and an enhanced voter education campaign, including media, will commence by 12 January 2017.
