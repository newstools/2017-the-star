Kisii Senator Chris Obure left Cord leader Raila Odinga&rsquo;s camp because the former PM has lost twice in the presidential race, he has said.Obure said he devoted his time and energy to campaign for Raila in Kisii in the two past elections, but the ODM leader did not win.He joined the Jubilee Party led by President Uhuru Kenyatta because it is the winning team, he said.The senator addressed 1,800 youths allied to Jubilee at Tendere Secondary School in Bomachoge Chache on Sunday.We&rsquo;ll vote UhuruDuring the meeting, the youths, drawn from the nine Kisii subcounties, said they will vote for Uhuru and Deputy President William Ruto at the August 8 polls.Leaders at the meeting included Deputy Governor Joash Maangi, MPs Stephen Manoti (Bobasi), Joel Onyancha (Bomachoge Borabu), Jimmy Angwenyi (Kitutu Chache North), Simon Ogari (Bomachoge Chache), Richard Tongi (Nyaribari Chache), Zebedeo Opore (Bonchari), former CIC chairman Charles Nyachae, MCAs and several aspirants.Obure said the leaders present were elected on various parties at the March 4, 2013, election and were not working together, but they realised there was a vacuum in leadership in the region.&ldquo;We decided to work together as leaders, despite our party affiliations, because of the interests of the people,&rdquo; he said.Obure, who wants to run for Kisii governor, faulted the incumbent James Ongwae for mismanaging public funds.Jubilee has the numbersThe MPs said Uhuru will win the election because he has the numbers compared to the opposition.They urged all adults who have not registered to vote to do so and beat the opposition.Angwenyi said the head of state deserves to be reelected because he has improved development and employment.Raila should not be given a chance to lead Kenya because he is a leader who does not see any positive thing Uhuru has achieved since he took office in 2013, he said.&ldquo;How can Odinga criticise everything, including what he sees as an achievement by the Jubilee government?&rdquo; Angwenyi said.
