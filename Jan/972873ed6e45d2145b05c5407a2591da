Former Transport minister Amos Kimunya is a coward and has betrayed the hopes of Nyandarua people by declaring he will not run for governor, but instead Kipipiri MP, an aspirant has said.Kimunya was Kipipiri MP for 10 years until 2013 when he lost to Samuel Gichigi. He wants to run on the Jubilee Party ticket.On Saturday, he said though residents have been urging him to run for governor, he prefers to run for MP so he can complete projects he had began and which have stalled since 2013.Former Nyandarua ODM chairman Njenga Kamau, who wants to run for Kipipiri MP on the JP ticket, said although everyone has freedom of choice, it is worrying and sad that Kimunya has chosen to act like "a cheetah or a leopard which leaves the forest where they can easily kill antelopes to compete for rats with domestic cats".
