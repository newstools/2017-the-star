The identification of residents to be affected by the standard gauge railway in Naivasha has started.Naivasha subcounty commissioner Isaac Masinde said the National Land Commission and the Kenya Railways Corporation will be involved.He said the final and official SGR route from Nairobi to Olkaria will be released in a few weeks.&ldquo;We had problems with some communities over the route, but this has now been resolved, meaning the real groundwork will start anytime,&rdquo; Masinde said.Speaking in Naivasha town, he said the project is very crucial to Kenya&rsquo;s economy and urged those affected to cooperate and support it.&ldquo;Members of the communities near the project site have complained over the dust and this is being addressed,&rdquo; Masinde said.Seeking compensationHe said they have written to the Kenya National Highways Authority to erect speed bumps at Satellite on the Mai Mahiu-Narok road.Masinde said the section is very busy due to the high number of trucks entering or leaving the site.&ldquo;We are losing two people, mainly pastoralists, on this section of the road every month, and with increased activities on the SGR site, there is need for speed bumps,&rdquo; he said.Speaking earlier, members of the Maasai community urged the government to compensate residents before the work starts.Women&rsquo;s leader Elizabeth Wanjiru from Nkoroi Welfare Association in Kajiado said they are in the dark over the project.&ldquo;We have invested heavily in the areas we live and because some houses will have to be demolished, we need to be given details of the compensation process,&rdquo; she said.Community elder Elijah ole Koilel from Narok urged the KRC to ensure the compensation is done before the project starts.&ldquo;We live on land that does not have a title deed. Some of our houses are manyattas and cannot be compensated the same way as permanent houses in other areas,&rdquo; he said.
