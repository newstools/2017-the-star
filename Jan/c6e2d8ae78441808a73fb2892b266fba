Governors have resolved to take legal action against Interior Cabinet Secretary Joseph Nkaissery for withdrawing the security detail of Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho and his Kilifi counterpart Amason Kingi. In a statement yesterday, the CoG rebuked Nkaissery&rsquo;s action, saying the government has failed to provide satisfactory justification.The council argues governors are state officers under oath of office and are entitled to security as prescribed by Article 260 of the Constitution and other state service statutes. The governors&rsquo; security was withdrawn on Saturday. Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinett on Sunday said the two contravened guidelines on state security entitlement, but declined to clarify the guidelines. He said it is an intelligence matter.The council said it will sue Nkaissery for violating the Constitution, which says security is one of the benefits state officers get for serving in the county governments.The governors sought a meeting with President Uhuru Kenyatta to discuss the matter, as well as other issues touching on the counties. The opposition says withdrawing governors&rsquo; security detail is intimidation aimed to silence vocal Jubilee critics.
