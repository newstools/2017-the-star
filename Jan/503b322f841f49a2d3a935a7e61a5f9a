Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya wants two classrooms set aside for local students at the two national schools in the county. They are Kakamega Boys and Butere Girls High School. Oparanya said the schools should admit local students who scored 340 and above in the KCPE exam. Kakamega is home to bright students who miss admission opportunities in national schools, he said. &ldquo;We therefore want the two schools to create slots for local students to be able to join the national schools in the county,&rdquo; Oparanya said. It is unfair for schools to be filled with students from elsewhere when bright learners from Kakamega miss admission into the national schools, he said. Oparanya spoke during a funeral at Nyenyesi, Butere, on Saturday, Oparanya said. He urged parents with students who scored 340 marks and above to apply for county slots at Kakamega Boys and Butere Girls at the offices of ward administrators.Oparanya said the county has allocated funds towards educating students joining secondary, colleges and universities. &ldquo;We urge university and college students to seek their education bursary from the county ministry of education. Secondary school students can apply through their ward administrators and through the offices of the members of county assembly,&rdquo; he said.Oparanya said the county has also sponsored students studying in China and built modern polytechnics in each constituency. &ldquo;Our intention is for the county to have skilled and qualified personnel who can be accepted on the job market&rdquo; he said.
