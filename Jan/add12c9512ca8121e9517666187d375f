Deputy President William Ruto&rsquo;s tour of the North Rift to mobilise residents to register as voters exposed some of his close allies to public humiliation for alleged absence or poor performance. Residents of Uasin Gishu, Baringo and Elgeyo Marakwet used the DP&rsquo;s rallies to shout down some of the leaders who accompanied the DP. Ruto watched helplessly as Kabartonjo residents in Baringo unleashed their displeasure on Baringo North MP William Cheptumo and Baringo woman representative Grace Kiptui. Cheptumo addressed the meetings amid booing from the crowd.Uasin Gishu Senator Isaac Melly also faced a hostile reception at Chembulet near Eldoret, where the DP also addressed another rally on Saturday.Contacted for comment, the legislators accused their rivals of hiring goons to heckle them at the rallies.Other MPs who have in the recent past similarly faced residents&rsquo; wrath and have been skipping the DP&rsquo;s meetings to avoid humiliation.Many aspirants used Ruto&rsquo;s rallies to introduce themselves to residents and declare their loyalty to the Jubilee Party. Some of the DP&rsquo;s allies, however, including Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen and Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago were cheered by the crowds. Ruto said he would camp in the region until all those with IDs are registered as voters. &ldquo;The most important thing now is that we should all register as voters,&rdquo; the DP said. He also told chiefs to ensure IDs are processed in three days.&ldquo;The applications must be taken to Nairobi and returned within three days,&rdquo; Ruto said.President Uhuru Kenyatta has also directed chiefs to deliver the IDs to applicants within their areas. Yesterday, Uasin Gishu county commissioner Abdi Hassan said they would implement the President&rsquo;s directives on the IDs.
