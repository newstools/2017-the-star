Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries CS Willy Bett thinks the act of wearing the infamous mitumba, or second hand clothing is embarrassing to Kenyans.He said this while in Mwachande village in Msambweni, Kwale County, where a group of farmers are planting cotton.&ldquo;Pamba ilikuwa inabamba (Cotton used to be a great product). What happened? We would not want to be wearing mitumba, something that has been worn by someone else, and discarded; it is embarrassing.&rdquo;But the real shame, the minister will agree is that almost four decades ago, in the 1980s; the country had a vibrant cotton industry.There were several ginneries and textile industries like Rift Valley Textiles, Rivatex, renowned for manufacturing casual shirts and which collapsed in the early 2000&rsquo;s before being acquired and revived by Moi University, There also was Kicomi, Kisumu Cotton Mills, which collapsed in the 1990s, and which now leaders are lobbying for its revival, and Thika Textile Industries.&ldquo;The Government is committed to reviving the industry, this has seen me travel all the way from Nairobi after I heard of your project,&rdquo; said the minister.The Zubla Welfare Group project has been made possible by Base Titanium, the mining company which set base in the area in 2013, and which reputes self as Kenya&rsquo;s first large- scale mineral sands mining development project. As part of its &lsquo;give back&rsquo; to the society, which has allowed them to sift their sands in order to mine ilmenite and rutile, the two primary sources of titanium, Base has invested in empowering the Kwale residents with agriculture. Apart from cotton, which also individuals are now planting on small case, other farmers are reaping from potato farming, and poultry rearing.&ldquo;We call this the Livelihood Projects,&rdquo; says Colin Forbes, the General Manager, Environment and Community Affairs at Base Titanium.As Bett shows, cotton production has decreased in Kenya, with only small scale farming in some parts including Eastern Kenya and Nyanza. But in the Coast, where cotton was vibrant in days gone by, the industry has more than died. Indeed, Rivatex does not mention the region when noting where it sources its cotton including from Kisumu, Kitui and Baringo in Mogotio, despite 90 percent of the Coastal land being conducive for cotton growing, including the fertile Mpeketoni and Lamu.As the Agriculture CS toured Msambweni in Kwale mid-November with an invitation from Base Titanium, most of the residents were surviving on relief food, following a biting drought. Ironically, apart from being conducive for cotton, the area is favourable to sugarcane, where it takes 12 months to mature, as compared to Western Kenya, which takes 18 months. And don&rsquo;t forget the palm tree, the magical plant whose every part has a commercial use, from the leaves to the bark to the coconut fruit.Most farmers are uprooting the tree, whereas today there are new varieties which mature faster, and are shorter and more productive.This is the Promised Land living dangerously under potential.Now Zubla says it has woken from its slumber, and will try its hand at reviving the cotton industry. So, with a Sh275,000 loan from Base Titanium, and Sh 80,000 group contributions, Zubla leased 300 acres of land and planted on an initial 80 acres, which they are now harvesting.A large group of 62 members, they have been working in shifts, every day, bringing in organic manure, one tonne per acre, weeding and spraying the crop to now harvesting.&ldquo;We liked the idea of cotton more from other of Base projects, potato farming and chicken rearing,&rdquo; says Hussein Myega, the Zubla chairman &ldquo;as it used to do well here, but no one is planting it anymore. We are optimistic it will change our fortunes.&rdquo;Myega adds that one of their members, Maarufu Hassan was trained by Business for Development, B4D, a Base partner on the process of cotton planting and he now trains the rest of the group members.They started planting in April having cleared the expansive land by hand, and by October, the crop was ready for harvest though they have encountered some challenges along the way.&ldquo;First it was the pests,&rdquo; says the supervisor Mohamed Hassan, &ldquo;and then the drought hit.&rdquo; They say both of these unforeseen challenges destroyed 20 acres of cotton, and now they have harvested about a quarter of the remaining 60 acres.&ldquo;We already have about 1770 kilograms of cotton, of which we sell for Sh56 a kilo to B4D,&rdquo; says the chairman. Base through its partners, B4D, and Cotton On has identified an export market in Bangladesh. This is through the Cotton On Group&rsquo;s global supply chains. The cotton will first be ginned at the Makueni Ginneries. However, Forbes hopes that eventually, they will be able to get a local market, the likes of Export Processing Zones, EPZ, and or other textile manufacturers like Rivatex.Taking the CS around the Zubla farm, the Chairman had asked him to kindly, among other interventions, provide them with land.However, the CS, though saying the government is keen to revive the sector, told the group it will use its available land for demonstration purposes.&ldquo;The challenge,&rdquo; said the CS &ldquo;is getting an affordable and efficacious seed. When we get this right, and have more people planting cotton, we are planning, with partners like Base to build a ginnery here.&rdquo; This was received with cheers.At the expansive farm, Zubla is experimenting with two seeds, which they call the Kenyan traditional variety, and the hybrid, each planted on its side: &ldquo;We want to see which is better suited for our environment,&rdquo; said the Chairman.But looking at both varieties, what they call the traditional Kenyan variety looks better; cleaner and whiter as compared to the hybrid. And indeed, in an earlier interview Forbes had said that the Kenyan variety is regarded as among the top 75 percent in quality, though hybrid matures faster, and is more resistant to the persistent pests.Hesbon Olweny, an Agronomist with B4D explains the two varieties. He says Kenya has two commercial varieties, the KSA 81M adapted to western region and HART 89M for the Eastern region including in Kwale.&ldquo;These two were registered in 1981 and 1989 and are not available as certified seed,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;they are recycled and sourced from local ginneries. Kwale County sources from the Makueni Ginneries.&rdquo;He adds that more work need to be done on the conventional seeds in terms of purity, pest tolerance and yield potential.The certified hybrids were only recently introduced in the country and have undergone trials with the Kenya Plant and Health Inspectorate Service, KEPHIS and they are superior in yield, pest tolerance and unlike the conventional seeds which mature in 170- 190 days, mature early, 150 days.&ldquo;Certified cotton seed is key to improving cotton production in Kenya, as they guarantee the known traits of a variety such as uniformity, high yields, growth period, high quality and resistance to pests and diseases.&rdquo;Thus, the hybrid variety is the best bet for the country.With a ready market, Zubla is excited that they will change their fortunes, and they are not bothered by the labour intensive nature of cotton during pest control and harvest seasons.
