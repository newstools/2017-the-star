Public hospitals in Bungoma county have been hit by acute drug shortage after Kemsa cut off supply over a Sh21 million debt.A check by the Star in some hospitals yesterday showed they lack basic supplies like the anti-malarial drugs, painkillers and syringes.Health chief officer Robert Simiyu said the county has not cleared a debt owed to the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority, which delivered the last supply in September last year. He said they have paid Sh9 million and the remaining Sh13 million will be paid by today. He blamed the delay in payment on late release of funds by the national government to counties.
