Baringo county security officers have warned residents against unnerving Pokot bandits saying they are very dangerous and can kill.County commissioner Peter Okwanyo noted that they have crossed their borders to find pasture for their animals amid an acute drought.He told a peace baraza at Kagir on Thursday that they may continue looking for pasture until mid April when the weather is likely to change.Further noting that Pokot bandits "are not people to joke with", Okwanyo said locals should not carry out retaliatory attacks."They are very delicate people, like cats. If you push them to the wall intending to kill them, they will turn back and tear you apart," he said."Lay low, graze and water your livestock together peacefully until it rains and they get back to their homes," he said and advised against theft.The commissioner further advised residents to report any attacks and the theft of their livestock to the nearest police stations.Pokot herders have taken their animals to parts including Tot and Chesongoch in Kerio Valley (Elgeyo Marakwet county), Kagir, Yatya and Ngaratuko in Baringo North, and Arabal, Mukutani, Ruggus and Noosukro in Baringo South subcounty.Okwanyo said the government cannot force them to leave as this would make matters worse.Baringo North subcounty deputy commissioner John Tanui and his East Pokot counterpart Daniel Kirui also attended the meeting.Residents criticised them saying they sounded defeated and unable to protect them.Their warning came about two weeks after Kagir residents complained that Pokot bandits had stolen more than 200 of their goats and sheep."We are unsafe around armed Pokot people who can strike to kill, or steal our livestock, at any time," said Richard Chepchomei.He noted that Pokot herders were being allowed to take thousands of their animals, including camels and donkeys, to their land.Read: 1,000 people flee Baringo South after Pokot bandits shoot copAlso read: Anarchy fears as Samburu, Pokot gunmen surround Laikipia farms
