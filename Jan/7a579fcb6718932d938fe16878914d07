Non-payment of garbage contractors, inadequate trucks and frequent breakdown have contributed to the choking heaps of uncollected trash in several parts of the capital, a report says.The County Annual Development Plan 2017-18 stated that the contractors "frequently" withdraw their trucks and other equipment, affecting the collection and transportation of the waste to the Dandora dumpsite.The Plan, which was released two weeks ago and published on the county&rsquo;s website, did not, however, indicate the amount the city county owes the contractors.Speaking to the Star on the phone yesterday, Waste and Environment Association of Kenya chairman Samuel Onyancha said the county owes them more than Sh60 million.&ldquo;Payment is the major issue here. The county is not responding yet we struggle to work for them. We have to pay our workers, fuel our vehicles and do repairs,&rdquo; he said.Waste in Nairobi is collected by the county&rsquo;s own fleet, hired contractors and private service providers such as community-based organisations and organised youth groups.The residents, especially businesspeople, have complained of the choking heaps of garbage. Backstreets in the CBD, roadsides, estates, especially Eastlands, and markets have been turned into dumping sites.The Plan, prepared by Finance executive Gregory Mwakanongo, stated that &ldquo;prolonged procurement procedures&rdquo; for equipment to improve the Dandora dumpsite has also contributed to the situation.&ldquo;Rampant illegal dumping of solid waste and unsatisfactory state of repairs at the Dandora dumpsite have complicated the matter,&rdquo; the report states.About 2,400 tonnes of garbage are generated in the city each day, of which 68 per cent is domestic. Only about 1,500 tonnes are collected and dumped at the county&rsquo;s main waste yard in Dandora.The county mostly relies on hired equipment at the Dandora dumpsite such as the bulldozers and compactors, which is an expensive affair. The county has about 40 trucks, but most of them have broken down.In September, the county bought 17 new tracks for Sh60 million and set a side Sh50 million for repairs.Mwakanongo said the on-going court case challenging the franchising system of waste management in the capital has frustrated the county&rsquo;s plans to effectively manage the waste.Last year, the county spent Sh170 million in constructing a key road leading to the Dandora dumpsite, which the county said had been destroyed by rains. The county also acquired a new weighbridge and compactors.
