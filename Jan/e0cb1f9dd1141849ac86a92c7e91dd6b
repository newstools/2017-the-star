Strathmore University have merged their two Premier League sides into one strong unit that will challenge for the national title.Coach Tony Ochieng yesterday confirmed the move, saying the institution will now have one team in the premiership to be known as &lsquo;Blades&rsquo;. The other two will play in Division One and Nairobi Basketball Association (NBA) provincial league respectively.Both Blades and Strathmore played in the Premiership but none of the two made it to the play-offs. The former finished in seventh while the latter was placed ninth.&ldquo;It is true that we have finalised plans to have one strong team in the premier league. The other two will be used as feeders to supply quality players to the top side. This will help the team improve their performance in 2017,&rdquo; said Ochieng.With the merger, he said, they are strong medal prospects in this year&rsquo;s league. &ldquo;Training is already ongoing at the institution courts in readiness for the new season and all looks promising,&rdquo; he added. Recruitments for new players will kick off with try outs to be held on January 30. The selected players will be granted scholarships. Another one will follow in April and will be used to scout for players to feature in 2018.
