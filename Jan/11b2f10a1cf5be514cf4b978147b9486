Kiambu Governor William Kabogo has said the issuance of bursaries will be fair after MCAs were removed from the ward fund committees.He said some MCAs silently controlled the committees, favouring some students and leaving out those from needy families.Kabogo said the Controller of Budget had raised questions to the Education department, saying the MCAs role was to oversight and recommended their removal from committees.&ldquo;The Controller of Budget raised questions and we had to remove them. This issue has not been so sweet with them, but we had to comply,&rdquo; the governor said.He spoke at the Kiambu Institute of Science and Technology on Friday during the seminar of the ward bursary committees.Kabogo said some MCAs have politicised the issue.&ldquo;Some of our MCA&rsquo;s know what happened, but they are using the platform to critisice it. We have already announced this season's allocation and have invited students to collect the forms and apply,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;This time the bursaries will be issued without favouritism and in a transparent manner,&rdquo; the governor said.Kabogo said they will issue the first allocation of Sh60 million before March.He was accompanied by Education executive Esther Ndirangu and chief officer Anne Gichohi.The governor said his government has budgeted Sh180 million for bursary this year.Gichohi said they want the county assembly to increase the allocation, as students in need of the money have increased.&ldquo;We feel bad when we exhaust the allocation and bright but very needy students are locked out of school,&rdquo; she said.Ndirangu said day-scholars will receive Sh5,000 each, while those in boarding schools will get Sh8,000 each.She urged secondary school principals not to send home students who have applied for bursaries.
