Mid-tier Ecobank Kenya yesterday started relocating its head office operations to Westlands, four months after it put the Ecobank Towers in Nairobi&rsquo;s Central Business District on sale.The lender, a subsidiary of West Africa&rsquo;s giant EcobankTransnational Incorporated, invited bids for the 19-floor building along Muindi Mbingu street in September.The sale of the multibillion-shillings property, Ecobank said, will enable it &ldquo;focus on its core business&rdquo;. Ecobank entered Kenya in June 2008 after acquiring an initial 75.67 per cent stake in East Africa Building Society Bank. It later raised its shareholding to 95.67 per cent in July 2013.
