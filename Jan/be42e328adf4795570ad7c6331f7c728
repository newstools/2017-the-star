The Kenya Revenue Authority will phase out the 11-year old online clearing platform &ndash; Simba system &ndash; by April 1, in a new push to digitise its customs operations to help curb tax evasion.The system will be replaced by the new Integrated Customs Management System, which will become fully operational from April 1, the taxman has said. KRA commissioner general John Njiraini yesterday said the ICMS will &ldquo;enhance the ever changing business environment in customs and border control&rdquo;, a boost to its revenue collections.&ldquo;The customs management system is ready and awaiting deployment. The only reason we haven&rsquo;t deployed it is because we haven&rsquo;t set up the data centre. Some equipment has not been delivered but will be ready by March,&rdquo; Njiraini said in Nairobi, during the International Customs Day celebrations.This will bring to an end the use of the web-based application Simba 2005 System (Tradex).The one stop centre for online document processing and validation was established to replace the traditional long rooms countrywide but has had frequent downtimes, affecting clearing processes. The ICMS will have more enhanced features, Njiraini said, which will assist in faster cargo clearing, secure trade chain, easy access to customs systems and reduce the cost of doing business. The authority has also completed putting up an Electronic Cargo Tracking System to be launched next month, which enables seamless visibility of transit cargo along the Northern Corridor counties of Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda. Njiraini said KRA is also committed to implement the pre-arrival cargo clearing system, a provision under the 2014 Mombasa Port Charter, which requires 70 per cent of cargo to be cleared under the system by this year.A new integrated scanner management solution is also being put in place, which is expected to be ready by June this year.&ldquo;This will centralise the management of scanners so that we are able to see what is happening about scanning across the country in one control room. All these will be integrated so that you are able to have one view about all the transactions that are happening about an individual,&rdquo; Njiraini said.The taxman has linked the iTax to third-party databases, with the first phase targeting companies getting state tenders under the Integrated Financial Management Information System.KRA which has previously missed its revenue targets collected Sh591.17 billion for six months through December, 44.44 per cent of the full-year 2016/17 target of Sh1.33 trillion.
