Garissa Governor Nathif Jama yesterday urged the national government to redouble its effort to fight the drought.&ldquo;As a county we have discussed ways if mitigating drought. Already we have started water trucking. We are also planning to send out food in different parts of the county,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;But even as we do this, at this stage the national government, which has the biggest share of the money, should chip and be seen on the ground. It is not something that only a county can do.&rdquo;Jama spoke during the assessment of Ugatuzi na Kazi programme, which was launched in 2014.Elsewhere, the Kenya Meat Commission yesterday slaughtered 25 cows that were too weak to be transported to its holding grounds in Kibarani (Mombasa), the ranches in Mackinon (Voi) and its factory in Athi River.It had received 100 cows for slaughter under the off-take programme, which is meant to cushion livestock owners from loss by buying their animals.KMC finance manager Davis Cheruiyot said the commission has received Sh170 million for the first phase of the programme. The money should be enough to buy 600 animals from Garissa herders, he said.The meat from the slaughtered cows will be distributed to hunger-stricken residents in Garissa town and its environs. Cheruiyot addressed the press at the town's slaughter ground.He said KMC expects more funds in two to three week to buy at least 2,000 animals. "This is a presidential directive and we shall ensure that it succeeds. We shall review the programme as the need arises," Cheruiyot said.
