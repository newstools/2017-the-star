An Eldoret court has issued orders halting Monday's planned burial of former nominated MP Mark Too.Chief magistrate Nicodemus Moseti issued the orders on Friday after lawyer Simon Lilan moved to the court seeking to have independent investigations into his death.A postmortem on Wednesday confirmed Too died from a heart problem shortly after Lilan alleged he may have been poisoned.Lilan argues that the burial was being hurried up in a suspicious manner yet he has strong belief that Too may have been killed because of politics and his wealth.&ldquo;I cannot rest until I know Mark Too was not assassinated that is all I want the truth. There is nothing wrong with knowing the truth,&rdquo; Lilan told journalists.[AUDIO] Eldoret lawyer now alleges plot to kill Mark Too's first wifeLilan has sued Too's second wife Sophie, the burial committee, including Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi, the Attorney General and the Lee Funeral Home where Too's body is lying.The magistrate ordered that the case be heard inter-partes on January 12.Earlier this week, a woman has asked a court to stop the burial, demanding her son's inclusion in the arrangements.Fatuma Hassan said in her application filed as urgent that the late former Nominated MP was the 16-year-old boy's father.More on this: Woman says Mark Too was her son's father, wants burial stoppedHassan told the court that Too's widows Sophie and Mary have deliberately excluded her son from funeral arrangements.But she withdrew her case after the family agreed to her son's participation.Too, 64, died after a short illness at St Lukes Hospital in Eldoret on December 31.
