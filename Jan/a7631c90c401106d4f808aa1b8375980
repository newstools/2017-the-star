More than 85,000 small-scale tea farmers have benefited from the Farmers Field School programme.The three-year programme is a collaboration between the KTDA, Unilever and the Sustainable Trade Initiative at a cost of Sh140 million. Kenya Tea Development Agency CEO Lerionka Tiampati said the initiative is designed to improve tea output and equip farmers with other income generating skills by diversifying to other crops and livestock.Speaking at Momul Tea Factory, Kericho, he said the increase in green leaf production has had a positive correlation with the income earned, despite the gradual fall in tea prices.Tiampati said in 2015-16, KTDA earned the smallholder tea farmers a record Sh84 billion, compared to Sh63.5 billion in 2014-15. &ldquo;To quantify the gains of FFS, the annual green leaf production generally has risen from lows of 727 million kilos in 2008-09 to highs of 1,233 million kilos in 2015-16,&rdquo; he said.Tiampati said farmers have been trained on nursery establishment, planting, plucking, plant nutrition, pruning and pest management.
