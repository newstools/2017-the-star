Vihiga Governor Moses Akaranga has accused the National Assembly of delaying the review of the Maseno boundary.On Wednesday, he said the parliamentary committee set up mid last year to probe the boundary dispute is yet to table its report for debate.During a tour of Mwibona ward in Luanda subcounty, Akaranga said residents living near the boundary are getting impatient.&ldquo;Our MPs should ensure the report is debated as soon as possible,&rdquo; he said.Last year, Akaranga demanded a review of the boundary, saying tax collected from Maseno was taken to Kisumu county &ldquo;yet Maseno is in Vihiga&rdquo;.This caused an uproar among Kisumu leaders.Some people accused Akaranga of inciting residents, who had hitherto lived in harmony.Akaranga said the Maseno dispute is one of one of the historical injustices that needs to be addressed urgently.In July last year, Cord leader Raila Odinga urged leaders from the two counties to resolve the dispute.Luanda MP Chris Omulele said the problem is how to share resources from Maseno. In a petition to the National Assembly, residents called for equitable distribution of resources.
