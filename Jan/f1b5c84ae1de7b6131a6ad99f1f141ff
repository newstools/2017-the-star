Nairobi governor Evans Kidero on Tuesday ordered striking doctors from the county to resume duty by Friday or face the sack.He said that the county had given the doctors showcause letters on why disciplinary should not be taken against them for taking part in an illegal strike.The governor said that the work boycott, which has lasted more than one month, has greatly affected innocent Kenyans who cannot afford treatment at private hospitals.Kidero said that the 124 doctors in the county will not be paid their December salaries since they were not on duty."Why pay someone for a job they have not done. We will by Friday sack them and employ other doctors," he said."The doctors joined the strike despite the court declaring it illegal," he said during a visit to victims of a slum fire at Mathare.In December, Kidero said that 54 doctors had resumed work at various hospitals in the county.Meanwhile, the High Court on Tuesday issued warrants of arrest for KMPDU officials after they failed to appear for a hearing on the matter.Last month, the Labour Relations court declared the doctors strike illegal and ordered them to resume work immediately.The court had directed union officials to call off the strike that has reportedly contributed to the deaths of at least 20 people. But the union defied the orders on grounds that the government has to honour a comprehensive bargaining agreement it signed with them in 2013.Read: Labour court declares doctors strike illegal Justice Wasilwa Hellen, in her judgement, said the doctors failed to appear for sentencing in contempt charges.On Monday, Council of Governors chair Peter Munya said counties were free to advertise doctors' positions and conduct recruitment so the public can be treated.Munya said public service boards had been instructed to begin the processes of firing striking doctors.The doctors, after a meeting with President Uhuru Kenyatta in Mombasa, rejected the government's offer to increase their salaries by 40 per cent.
