Malindi MP Willy Mtengo and the Kilifi Woman rep Aisha Jumwa are embroiled in bitter political fight over the Malindi parliamentary seat.The two do not see eye to eye and their supremacy wars are growing bigger by the day. They have been engaging in petty politics to the extent of hurling insults at each other in separate campaign rallies. The two fell out after Jumwa declared her interest to unseat Mtengo, barely weeks after he won the March 7, 2016 by-election.On Saturday, the woman rep said she is not afraid of the incumbent and accused him of insulting her in funerals and rallies.&ldquo;Yeye [Mtengo] anasema atanitia maji. Mimi namwambia yeye ndio anatiwa maji, na nitamuonyesha wakati wa uchaguzi,&rsquo;&rsquo; [He claims he will water me out. But I am telling him it is hime who will be watered out and I&rsquo;ll show him at the polls],&rdquo; she said.Jumwa also criticised Mtengo&rsquo;s claims that she is not from Malindi and doesn&rsquo;t therefore deserve to be their MP.In a quick rejoinder, the incumbent dismissed her claims and insisted he will defeat the woman rep in the primaries. He said he was the bonafide elected MP, elected by the majority and will retain his seat because of his development record in the short time he has been in office. He said since Jumwa declared her interest for the Malindi seat, she has been hurling insults and using the politics of division to create conflicts, something that has not been witnessed in the past.&ldquo;Since the times of the first MP Bobi Tuva, we have always played mature politics. Now, Jumwa is trying to change that by creating an unnecessary conflicts,&rsquo;&rsquo; Mtengo said. He spoke to journalists at the Malindi subcounty commissioner&rsquo;s office on Monday, where he gave Sh500,000 cheque to boda boda operators.
