The battle for Nyamira senator will not be a two-horse race, an aspirant has said. Timothy Rioba dismissed speculation that the race is between East Africa Legislative Assembly member Joseph Kiangoi and senior counsel Okong&rsquo;o O&rsquo;Mogeni.&ldquo;There is a narrative that it will be a two-horse race. That is totally wrong and people will be shocked,&rdquo; Rioba said.He said there are four horses in the race &mdash; O&rsquo;Mogeni, Kiangoi, lawyer Nyambega Mose and himself. Rioba and Kiangoi will have to square it out in the Jubilee Party nominations first. &ldquo;Whoever carries the day in the Jubilee nominations will be the senator and I promise to floor Kiangoi in the primaries,&rdquo; Rioba said on Thursday.Kiangoi and Rioba hail from North Mugirango constituency, while O&rsquo;Mogeni comes from West Mugirango though he has settled in Borabu constituency. Mose is from Kitutu Masaba. Clannism is likely to play a key role in the polls. Rioba hinted at the possibility of aspirants exploring negotiated democracy.
