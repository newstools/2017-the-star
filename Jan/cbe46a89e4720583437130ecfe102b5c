The lead investigator into the death of Careen Chepchumba yesterday said there was no evidence linking anyone to the murder, hence the option for an inquest.Richard Maobe told the court that all the evidence collected at Careen&rsquo;s home was not sufficient to sustain a murder trial. He said Careen (pictured) was strangled to death.The investigator said blood samples and nail clippings were taken from former news anchor Louis Otieno and forwarded to the government chemist for analysis, together with samples taken from Careen.On interrogation, Otieno claimed he was in Kajiado when Careen was found dead, but they did not follow up to confirm the allegations, Maobe said.Government analyst Ann Wangeci told the court that it took more than four years to conduct and write the report of the analysis that was requested by the court in February 2012. Wangeci said she prepared the report on November 14 last year for lack of chemicals and change of management at the government&rsquo;s laboratories.According to her findings, DNA generated from all the items given to the laboratory indicated that the blood was Careen&rsquo;s.She said she could not determine if the blood she was given for analysis was that of Otieno or somebody else.Careen, 26, was found dead at her house in Santonia Court, Kilimani, on February 14 and Otieno was the main suspect in the case.However, police claim they did not find any evidence linking him to her death.The inquest resumes on January 24.
