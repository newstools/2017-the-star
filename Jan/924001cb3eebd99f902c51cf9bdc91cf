The report noted that countries that were found most corrupt are plagued by untrustworthy and badly functioning public institutions like the police and the Judiciary."Even where anti-corruption laws are in the books, in practice they're often skirted or ignored," it stated.The report added that in these countries, people are often in situations that include bribery and extortion.TI recommended that African leaders who come to office on an &ldquo;anti-corruption ticket&rdquo; will need to live up to their pledges.The report said they must implement their commitments to the principles of governance, democracy and human rights.These include strengthening the institutions that hold their governments accountable and electoral systems that allow citizens to either re-elect them or freely choose an alternative.The report noted that countries ranked least corrupt tend to have higher degrees of press freedom, access to information about public expenditure, stronger standards of integrity for public officials, and independent judicial systems.But TI said these nations can afford to be complacent."While the most obvious forms of corruption may not scar citizens' daily lives in all these places, the higher-ranked countries are not immune to closed-door deals," the report stated.
