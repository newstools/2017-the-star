Kericho Kanu officials have backed calls for President Uhuru Kenyatta to engage the Kalenjin community directly instead of involving Deputy President William Ruto.They said they agreed with their national chairman Gideon Moi that the region has no problem with Uhuru, but with what they termed Ruto's dictatorship.William Kettienya, the region's party chairman, said they don't want to be engaged by Ruto as he has turned out to be a "cruel, harsh and unforgiving leader"."Ruto is a person who cannot forgive or apologise to anybody he perceives as a political enemy," the independence party official said on Tuesday.He spoke barely a day after Ruto and Gideon engaged in a supremacy battle over the control of Rift Valley ahead of the August 8 general election.The two were embroiled in a war of words before Uhuru and other mourners who attended the funeral of former Nominated MP Mark Too in Kapseret on Monday.While Gideon asked Kalenjin community leaders to tread carefully in their quest to back Jubilee Party, Ruto dismissed him."I wonder why some people would like to look back and wait for failures that are the opposing parties. Leaders should set their goals as we did in 2013," said the DPRead: Once Kalenjins decide, you can&rsquo;t divide them, Ruto tells GideonRuto and Gideon have attacked each other on several occasions as they reposition themselves to give the vote-rich region political direction ahead of the poll.Gideon warned in December that Ruto was perpetrating self-centered politics that will divide Kenyans.He said the public will only re-elect the Jubilee administration because of Uhuru, and that they are the ones who will choose his successor.More on this:'Selfish' Ruto is pushing 2022 presidency at expense of unity - Gideon MoiKettienya said Ruto, who is former Eldoret North MP, should be worried that some of his cronies have stayed away from his 2022 presidential bid."The DP's character has distanced him from some Kenyans who would have backed his presidential ambition. His combative politics is outdated," he told the press in Kericho.The chairman urged the DP to make amends with Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto, MPs Alfred Keter (Nandi Hills), Oscar Sudi (Kapseret), Johana Ngeno (Emurua Dikirr) and Zakayo Cheruiyot (Kuresoi)."How will Ruto clinch the presidency without the support of the Kalenjins? He stands no chance of succeeding Uhuru with that style of politics," he warned.He further told the DP to borrow a leaf from leaders from Central, whom he said have demonstrated solidarity with Uhuru and Luhyas who have backed Amani leader Musalia Mudavadi."As deputy president, what efforts has Ruto made to reconcile with the leaders from this region?" Kettienya asked, adding that the DP risks failing the presidency unless he changes."Ruto has the opportunity to change now and become a national figure, acceptable by all Kenyans. He should ensure all the Kalenjin sub-tribes are fully behind him so as to convince other Kenyans that he is a leader worth succeeding Uhuru."Read: Ruto dictatorial, meddling in Rift Valley politics, Baringo Kanu MCAs sayAlso read: Ruto too busy to meddle with Rift Valley politics, youths tell Baringo MCAsKettienya also warned Ruto against using National Assembly Majority leader Aden Duale to attack leaders from the South Rift.He said the Deputy President has been ill-advised by the clique of leaders around him."These sycophants will drive the last nail on Ruto's political coffin unless he changes and engages the youth, women and men from this region," Kettienya said.Read: Carry Ruto on your back like your father was carried, Duale tells Gideon Moi
