An assault victim has accused the police of failing to arrest a suspect who attacked and injured him more than three weeks ago.Documents show that Wilfred Otieno was assaulted by people known to him on January 6, 2017. He says he and a cousin identified as Ben Alila were attacked as they left a club in Kilimani.Records made to Kilimani police station show that a scuffle happened inside the club at around 4.30 am as they sought to leave. During the scuffle, one of the suspects smashed his vehicle's windscreen.They were separated by bouncers at the club as one of the revelers whipped out a pistol and threatened to shoot them. He immediately reported the matter at Kilimani police station where he was given an OB number 16/07/01/2017.&ldquo;The attackers are people known to me. One has even been charged with misusing his firearm,&rdquo; he said.The 42-year-old businessman later in the day sought treatment at one of AAR's clinics. He was treated of soft tissue injuries and discharged.A medical report signed by Dr. Clement Mulwa dated January 7, 2017 shows that Otieno was hit using a blunt object.But since then, the police have not arrested or questioned any of the suspects, he said.
