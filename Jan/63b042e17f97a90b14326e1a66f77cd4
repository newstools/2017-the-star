The rejuvenated opposition is set to meet today at the Bomas of Kenya in what insiders say will alter Kenya&rsquo;s political landscape seven months to the August 2017 poll.Cord CEO Norman Magaya, who is at the centre of coordination of the Opposition behemoth, NASA, yesterday told the Star the meeting will herald an &ldquo;unstoppable political tornado&rdquo;. Opposition politicians are trying to replicate the historic 2002 Narc unity that toppled the Kanu regime.&ldquo;All is set and the preparations are almost complete,&rdquo; Magaya said. &ldquo;I can tell you its ramifications will be felt far and wide.&rdquo;On Monday, Cord management committee co-chairman James Orengo said the meeting is significant in setting out winning strategies. This is be the first time all opposition chiefs will publicly come together, amid revelations of plans to unveil their presidential candidate in February. About 15,000 hopefuls are expected to attend.ODM leader Raila Odinga, Wiper&rsquo;s Kalonzo Musyoka, Ford Kenya&rsquo;s Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula and ANC&rsquo;s Musalia Mudavadi are angling to be the super alliance&rsquo;s flagbearer.Sources, however, said the opposition may drop its initial plan for mass street protests to undo the enactment of the controversial election laws, as that would likely hurt its voter registration drive. It&rsquo;s unclear whether it plans to move to court. The IEBC plans to register more than six million voters in the month-long voter listing that starts next week.
