The Anti-Doping Agency of Kenya (ADAK) has called for cooperation between them and Athletics Kenya in the execution of mandates bestowed on the latter&rsquo;s newly-formed Kenya Doctors Network.ADAK, who were not invited in AK&rsquo;s anti-doping seminar where athletes were taken through what will be KDN&rsquo;s activities in Eldoret on Monday, cautioned the latter against taking over mandate of the government body.&ldquo;This network (KDN) should not in any way take over the mandate of ADAK or replace the institutions and committees within the Agency charged with offering professional expertise such as the Therapeutic Use Exemption Committee (TUEC),&rdquo; charged ADAK chief executive officer Japhter Rugut.&ldquo;ADAK will continue working with sports organizations to discharge this mandate and to ensure that they all adhere to the ADAK Anti-Doping rules and to the World Anti-Doping Code.&rdquo;However, Rugut recognised the viability of AK&rsquo;s efforts in setting up the network &lsquo;as a way of ensuring that their members do not fall into the hands of unscrupulous, corrupt, unethical or quack medical doctors who may expose the athletes to Anti-Doping Rules Violations (ADRVs).&rsquo;&ldquo;In underscoring our support towards the KDN initiative, the Agency will work closely with AK to ensure that the doctors in this network are trained on anti-doping matters and that they comply with the ADAK Anti-Doping Rules as well as making them fully aware of the tenets upheld in the World Anti-Doping Code and it&rsquo;s related International Standards,&rdquo; added Rugut.&ldquo;Education is being carried out at all levels from the elite&rsquo; athletes to the lower levels of tertiary institutions and schools to develop a positive culture amongst the youth by discouraging them from doping and inspiring them to play clean.&rdquo;
