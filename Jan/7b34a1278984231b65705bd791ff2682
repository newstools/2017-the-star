A renaissance of sorts in Kenyan football arrived on February 10, 2016 when Nick Mwendwa was overwhelmingly elected as the new Football Kenya Federation (FKF) president, ending the reign of Sam Nymaweya who didn&rsquo;t contest the polls at the last minute. Mwendwa&rsquo;s election ushered in hopes that at last Kenyan football and the incessant lamentations over it&rsquo;s magnet would be a thing of the past with the new boss vowing to put in structures that would see the game grow at all levels without the personality cult of previous years. For a start, Mwendwa appointed Stanley Okumbi as head coach ten days after taking office, leaving naysayers struggling to grasp his vision. Then Okumbi was viewed as greenhorn incapable of succeeding where the likes of Henry Michel and Bobby Williamson as well as Bernard Lima had failed spectacularly. Two games into his reign, pundits looked to have been proved right as Kenya lost home and away to Guinea Bissau, to all but end their hopes of qualification for the African Cup of Nations. But soon, Okumbi found his footing and went on an unbeaten streak of over half a dozen games that lasts to date.Mwendwa in his thinking had mandated Okumbi to build a team capable of competing for qualification for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar as that one of Russia had already passed us by.Mwendwa brought in German Andreas Spier as the technical director to spearhead the search and nurturing of youth talent. The highest point for the federation was the qualification of the national women team to the African women&rsquo;s Nations Cup for the first time in their history by beating Algeria in April but they would go on to perform dismally in the games losing to Mali, Ghana and Nigeria.Low point for the new federation was the disqualification of the national under-20 team from the African Championships as some players were above the age required to take part in the tourney. As the season approached its end, there was Muhoroni Youths stunning victory over Gor Mahia in the KPL Top 8 final while Tusker two weeks later claimed the GOtv Shield at the expense of Ulinzi Stars by a similar 1-0 score-line.More good news was to come for the brewers as they ended Gor&rsquo;s reign in the SportPesa Premier League edging the champions by seven points. The campaign ended with the promotion of Nzoia Sugar and Kariobangi Sharks to the KPL while Western Stima&rsquo;s Kenneth Muguna was named the SportPesa Footballer of the Year.
