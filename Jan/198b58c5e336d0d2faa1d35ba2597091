The Kikuyu Council Of Elders has dismissed reports by Rift Valley Council of Elders that they asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to drop DP William Ruto in the August 8 election.&ldquo;It is the prerogative of the President to choose his deputy. KCE has never requested President Uhuru to drop his deputy for any reason whatsoever and believes they are a winning combination,&rdquo; James Nene, Kikuyu Council of Elders Rift Valley, coordinator said. Last week, the Rift Valley Council of Elders dismissed the KCE as a tribal outfit.Nene, who is also KCE chairman of the Nakuru chapter, said they are unhappy with Rift Valley elders&rsquo; comments that are &ldquo;divisive and demeaning.&rdquo;Nene asked the Rift Valley elders to verify facts before issuing press statements.
