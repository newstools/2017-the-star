Tharaka Nithi Senator Kithure Kindiki has urged Tharaka Nithi residents to reelect him for one more term then he will run for a higher national position.&ldquo;Other politicians in the county can start preparing for the seat as I will not vie for senator anymore [after August 8],&rdquo; he said.Kindiki spoke at Kajiunduthi, Maara, yesterday where he launched the tarmacking of Marima-Weru-Karaa-Kiriaini road that will be constructed at a cost of Sh1 billion.After being installed a Njuri Ncheke elder and appointed as Meru spokesman in February 2015, Kindiki has been seeking to convince Ruto that he is best suited to be his running mate in 2022.He has been holding several fundraisers and meeting several legislators in Mt Kenya East in the past to get their support.Kindiki started hinting that he would be Ruto&rsquo;s running mate three years ago, but kept a low profile after Central leaders told him off and said they would support Ruto if he picks a running mate from the region.Kindiki yesterday told residents to allow him to travel countrywide after this year&rsquo;s election to popularise himself for the bid for national office.&ldquo;Kenya has been led by four presidents so far. Let the people of Central know we also want to lead. We cannot keep on voting in other people,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;President Uhuru Kenyatta has urged legislators in Jubilee to support Deputy President William Ruto&rsquo;s bid for President, but there will be a space somewhere since Ruto would have ascended and we have to talk,&rdquo; Kindiki said.He was with Maara MP Kareke Mbiuki, Tharaka Nithi woman representative Beatrice Nkatha and Muthambi MCA Wilson Nyaga.
