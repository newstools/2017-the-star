Mombasa governor Hassan Joho was released on Friday after youths stormed Mombasa DCI headquarters where he had allegedly been detained.Joho was reportedly detained at the station alongside MPs Rashid Bedzimba (Kisauni) and Suleiman Dori (Msambweni), as well as several MCAs.While addressing his supporters who protested the said detention, Joho claimed that they were arrested when they sought to secure a relative's release.Joho said that this was before the area criminal investigations officer ordered their release, refuting Police IG Joseph Boinnet assertions that the politicians had been held.Boinnet had told the media that Joho and the two MPs were not detained but were at the police station."An Inspector Rop ordered our arrest on grounds that we were obstructing investigations," the Governor said.His Kilifi counterpart Amason Kingi said that the police's action was to intimidate for refusing to work with Jubilee.Kingi said: "Will not be intimidated. We will not mute if we are frustrated. Residents should defend their leaders. We will stand for truth irrespective of their machineries,"Regional CID boss Pius Macharia said the leaders were not arrested but had gone to check on a suspect and refused to leave.This was after county director of communications Richard Chacha said the Governor was blocked from leaving the station since midday.Chacha said the relative Joho visited was arrested when officers raided and ransacked his home, amid a security withdrawal saga."The officers told him he also had to stay at the police station," Chacha said, adding there was no further communication.Joho's lawyer Mohamed Balala earlier said the politicians might spend the night at different stations."Orders were issued that the governor and the rest should not leave and should be brought clothes, indicating they were to stay here long," he said.The said suspect, only identified as Haroub, was released after depositing a Sh20,000 cash bail. Joho thanked the youth who went to the station to demand his release.Read: Joho, MP Nassir allegedly detained at Mombasa CID headquartersAlso read: Joho&rsquo;s relatives, friends homes raided, ransacked by policeYouth protest outside Mombasa DCI headquarters demanding the release of Governor Hassan Joho. /JOHN CHESOLI
