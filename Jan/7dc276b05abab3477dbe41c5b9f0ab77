It does not look good that, every time President Uhuru Kenyatta and Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho have a public spat at the Coast, the National Police Service withdraws NPS bodyguards hired by Coast governors.Yet again, both Joho and Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi have had their police guards and vehicles withdrawn. This follows Joho&rsquo;s criticism of Uhuru, saying that the President claims credit for the national government and Jubilee for completed county projects.The governors hire NPS officers and mostly provide them with vehicles and fuel in a completely legitimate transaction. But the NPS withdraws these officers at will, in the dead of night, by giving them oral orders.This is not right. And even where the availability of police officers might legitimately be constrained by other duties, their withdrawal should be much more procedural than orders given orally at night.If they must be withdrawn, the NPS should do so without leaving the governors without security &mdash; even for an hour.
