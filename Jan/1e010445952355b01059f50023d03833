Ivory Coast Prime Minister Daniel Duncan resigned and dissolved the government on Monday, a move that had been expected following elections last month but which was delayed two days by an army mutiny.Duncan had been expected to stand down on Saturday, but held off after dissident soldiers took over army bases in cities across the West African country on Friday demanding bonus payments.It took 48 hours to reach the deal to quell the revolt in an army that is made up of government troops and former rebels, and riven with divisions."I have tendered my resignation and that of the government," he said after a meeting with President Alassane Ouattara.Read: Ex-soldiers seize control of Ivory Coast's second cityOuattara kept hold of his majority in the December 18 parliamentary polls.
