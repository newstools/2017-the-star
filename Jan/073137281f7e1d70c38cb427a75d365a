Kambas will give Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka the bargaining power to run for President if all adults in the community register to vote, a politician said yesterday.&ldquo;Kambas must target to register at least 2.5 million voters to enable Kalonzo Musyoka to successfully claim a stake on the presidency,&rdquo; Kitui senator aspirant Enock Wambua said.&ldquo;If they do that [get vote cards] Kalonzo will win the presidency early in the day.&rdquo;The veteran journalist spoke to the Star on the phone. He recently quit his job as a Standard editor in charge of Weekend editions to join politics.Wambua said the only way Kambas can convince other Kenyans that they are serious with getting the presidency is by coming to the table with the requisite numbers.&ldquo;If they want Kalonzo Musyoka to become the President of Kenya they should forget that anybody else will give him the numbers to become President. It is for them to provide the numbers, then the rest of the country will join them,&rdquo; he said.Wambua said that from this Sunday he will personally sponsor a full-week caravan to mobilise Kitui residents to register to vote.&ldquo;I can assure you that it will be the biggest private initiative to support voter registration in the Lower Eastern region,&rdquo; he said.Wambua said the caravan will move by road from Athi in South Kitui to Usueni in Mwingi North.Countrywide mass voter registration began on January 16 and will end on February 14.
