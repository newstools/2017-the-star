Kisii Deputy Governor Joash Maangi&rsquo;s declaration to run for governor has put him on a collision course with Senator Chris Obure as both seek the Jubilee ticket.Maangi and Obure both ditched ODM. Maangi&rsquo;s announcement on Sunday appears to be an afterthought, because he initially supported Obure.Maangi becomes the fourth aspirant in the race seeking to unseat Governor James Ongwae. Others hopefuls are architect Boniface Omboto, South Mugirango MP Manson Nyamweya and lawyer Lumumba Nyaberi.Maangi&rsquo;s bid has divided a hitherto united front by some MPs to dethrone Ongwae.Addressing women allied to Jubilee at Gianchere Secondary School, Maangi said, &ldquo;I want to tell you that I will be like David in the Bible. I am going to run for governor.&rdquo;His announcement shocked many MPs at the event. Present were Obure, MPs Joel Onyancha (Bomachoge Borabu), Richard Tong&rsquo;i (Nyaribari Chache), Stephen Manoti (Bobasi), Zebedeo Opore (Bonchari), Simon Ogari (Bomachoge Chache) and Elijah Moindi (Nyaribari Masaba).Maangi said he decided to run because &ldquo;I am at the forefront in promoting Kisii unity.&rdquo;
