The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission wants to be enjoined in a case challenging the new regulations that provide instant fines for minor traffic offences. It says it has a stake in the matter because it investigates corruption and it participated in coming up with the rules being challenged. EACC believes the traffic rules will tackle corruption through paying bail, bond and fines directly to the government through M-Pesa. The EACC said that being an investigative agency, it is mandated with preventing corruption, which the traffic rules are meant to address. The commission said it is prudent for it to be party to the case. Late last year, the High Court suspended the rules. Justice Roselyne Aburili ordered that the rules be blocked temporarily, meaning motorists can be arrested or have their vehicles towed to police stations for minor offences. Aburili&rsquo;s order arose from an application filed by the Kenya National Union of Cooperative Staff.
