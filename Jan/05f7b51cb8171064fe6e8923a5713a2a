Former Nairobi assembly chief whip David Mberia has written to ODM, demanding an explanation for his replacement. The Karen MCA was locked out of his office in October and replaced with Parklands MCA Jaffer Kassam.&ldquo;I am not a crybaby, but what I want to know is why I was replaced. The party did not summon me or invite me to defend myself against any accusations,&rdquo; he told the Star yesterday.Mberia alleged majority leader Elias Otieno is behind his removal due to &ldquo;disagreements&rdquo; between the two of them. They have been at loggerheads since 2013. Mberia has on many occasions accused Otieno of incompetence, highhandedness and overstepping his mandate.&ldquo;The law gives me [as chief whip] the power to constitute and reshuffle members in committees, but he took all these roles,&rdquo; he said. Phone calls to Otieno went unanswered.
