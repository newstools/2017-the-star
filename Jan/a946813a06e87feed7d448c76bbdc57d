The World Bank has rated Kiambu as the second best in terms of ease of doing business following the county's launch of Biashara Fund.The Bretton Woods institution in its 2016 "Doing Business" report on the same rated Uasin Gishu as the best in terms of efficiency in issuance of licenses.The report revealed that it takes two days to process permits in the two counties, hence creates a suitable environment for start ups.World Bank stated there are seven counties which have introduced regulations or practices that increase the cost, time or complexity of doing business.Busia, Isiolo and Kakamega are among those that have significantly increased business permit fees to start a business.The agency also found that it is more difficult to obtain construction permits in Busia, Kiambu, Mombasa, Nairobi and Uasin Gishu."Infrequent committee meetings slowed down architectural and structural plan approvals in the counties," the report said."Building plan approval fees increased by more than 2.5 percentage points in Busia (Malaba), Kiambu (Thika) and Nairobi," World Bank reports.On the exemplary performance of Kiambu, Finance Executive Committee member Mary Nguli said the county has the right policies in place."Lowering rates, fees and charges; responsiveness to investors needs; increased developments and improved service delivery are the main factors," she said.She said that Governor William Kabogo has made the work easier by responding positively to investor needs and also by empowering youths.And Governor Kabogo said that digitisation of county services has sped up processing of requirements for investors to kick start businesses at the county."My government is committed to ensuring that businesses runs smoothly. We want to expand the county's economy," Kabogio said.Biashara Fund was launched in 2014 where young females - living with disabilities - are offered a capital advance of Sh100,000 for businesses.The same fund offers Sh500,000 to eligible groups seeking to start a business or that already operating a small enterprise in the county.The World Bank's annual report, now in its 14th year, looks at the regulatory environment for small and medium-sized companies.Read: Ease of Doing Business Index for countiesAlso read: Kenya ranks 92nd in ease of doing business
