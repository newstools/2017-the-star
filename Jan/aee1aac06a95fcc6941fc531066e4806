Parliamentarians will cut short their holiday this week to attend to two key issues in the National Assembly and the Senate.Speaker Ekwee Ethuro has summoned senators for a special sitting on Thursday to debate the contested electoral law amendments. In a Kenya Gazette notice, the Speaker said the Election Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2015 will be the only business of the day.National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi is expected to recall MPs for a special sitting to reject or approve the new IEBC commissioners. Last week, President Uhuru Kenyatta nominated Wafula Chebukati as the new Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission chairman. He forwarded his name alongside six others to Muturi.The six are Abdi Guliye, Boya Molu, Consolata Bucha, Margaret Mwachanya, Paul Kurgat and Roselyn Akombe. Before going on recess, the MPs passed a motion allowing the Speaker to directly send the names to the Justice and Legal Affairs Committee.Standing Orders would normally require the Speaker to read out the President's message in plenary before committing the names to the committee for vetting.The JLAC is expected to do the vetting between Wednesday and Thursday before reporting to the National Assembly, which will make the final decision.Last week, Ethuro directed the Senate Standing Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights to invite public input on amendments to the election laws. He pushed the debate to January 4 to allow the committee conduct public hearings.The senators met on December 28 to consider controversial changes made to the electoral laws and adopted by the National Assembly on December 21. On Wednesday and Thursday, the committee held public hearings on the amendments.The changes, which significantly alter the Elections Laws (Amendments) Act 2016, have been opposed by Cord leaders and members of the opposition. The opposition says allowing a manual back-up system is akin to reverting to the manual identification of voters and transmission of results.
