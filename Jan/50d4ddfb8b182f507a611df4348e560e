People living with disability have supported the use of a manual backup during the poll. National Council for Persons with Disabilities chairman David ole Sankok yesterday said lack of a manual backup will lock out the group.Speaking to the press in Narok town yesterday, Sankok said if the country will resort to BVR kits, then it will lock out 120,000 voters from disability community who have no eyes, arms and hands.&ldquo;We support digital voting system but it should be supported by manual backup. The failure of an electronic system is almost guaranteed and that will affect directly a large population of us because some of our disabilities do not allow us to use BVR Kits in any way,&rdquo; said Sankok.
