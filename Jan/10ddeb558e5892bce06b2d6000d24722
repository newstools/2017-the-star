Some Jubilee Party leaders want former presidential candidate Peter Kenneth to declare his stand and publicly defend President Uhuru Kenyatta.Led by Senate majority leader Kindiki Kithure on Sunday in Mathioya, they said Kenneth says he supports the President but he is quiet when other leaders are defending Jubilee.He said all aspirants running for election on the JP ticket have to work together to ensure the President and Deputy President William Ruto win with an overwhelming majority.Some members never come out to fight for the government when it is facing attacks from the opposition, leaving the burden to a few leaders, Kindiki said.Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria said he is facing 16 court cases for fighting for Jubilee and Kenneth should not just come from nowhere and be governor.
