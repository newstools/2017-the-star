Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko has said that he will only quit the race for governor if wananchi tell him to do so.Sonko warned other aspirants, especially from the Jubilee team, against calls 'to step down for so and so".Noting it is the prerogative of the people to choose a leader, he warned against imposition of politicians on residents."We have people wananchi do not want, people who have done nothing yet some want them to lead," he said."That is wrong and we will not accept it," he said during a church service at Jesus is Alive Ministries in Nairobi.He was with MPs Johnson Sakaja (Nominated), Dennis Waweru (Dagoreti South) and Bishop Margaret Wanjiru, who is former Starehe MP.The four have aligned themselves under #TeamNairobi and are opposed to former Gatanga MPs Peter Kenneth's candidature.They say Kenneth is a late-comer in Nairobi politics and will get in the way of President Uhuru Kenyatta's re-election.Sonko's team has been pushing for universal suffrage in the nomination of a candidate who will fly Jubilee's flag in Nairobi.Read: No boardroom candidates for Nairobi county chief, says Jubilee's Team NairobiAlso read: Jubilee aspirants stand no chance of clinching Nairobi seat - KideroSonko earlier accused Starehe MP Maina Kamanda of threatening Jubilee Party aspirants opposed to bid for city governor.claimed Kamanda pledged to ensure all those who do not support Kenneth do not win Jubilee Party nominations.&ldquo;Kamanda is threatening governor, MP and MCA aspirants.
