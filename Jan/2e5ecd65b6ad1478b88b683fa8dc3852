Governors will no longer use police chase cars to move from one place to another, Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet has said.In a letter addressed to all regional county commanders, Boinnet warned that disciplinary action will be taken against any officer who goes against the directive.&ldquo;The police headquarters has noted with a lot of concern that police vehicles and police officers are escorting county government officials across the country and sometimes clearing roads for them at the expense of inconveniencing other road users. This must never occur again,&rdquo; he said.He has also warned county government officials against using the wrong side of the road.&ldquo;Besides the presidency all other protocols regarding chase cars and escorts are done as directed be the ministry of foreign affairs,&rdquo; he added.The developments come after it emerged that the State had withdrawn the security details of Governors Hassan Joho (Mombasa) and Amason Kingi (Kilifi).Ealier in the day, ODM leaders asked Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery to reinstate the governors' bodyguards, and termed the act uncouth"."If anything happens to the governor and his family, we will held someone responsible. The event unfolded mysteriously," Mvita MP Abdulawamad Nassir said.The politicians could not also verify if the two Governors had their firearm licences revoked.Sources said the move may have been because the two governors dressed down President Uhuru Kenyatta over projects he had launched during his tour of the Coastal region.
