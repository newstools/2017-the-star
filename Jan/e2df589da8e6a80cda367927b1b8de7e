The National Treasury has withdrawn the Sh3 billion it had allocated to the Ministry of Mining for aerial geophysical survey this financial year.Mining CS Dan Kazungu said the Treasury has asked the ministry to outsource funds for the programme.&ldquo;There was a directive from the Treasury in November that we look for funds elsewhere,&rdquo; Kazungu said.The changes followed a Supplementary Budget which has affected about 35 state departments, as the Treasury sought to scale down expenditure by Sh181 billion.The mini budget, tabled in the National Assembly early December, seeks to cut development spend by Sh213 billion and increase recurrent expenditure by Sh32 billion.The Treasury has directed the Mining ministry to consider a previous Memorandum of Understanding with China&rsquo;s Geological Exploration Technology Institute, to carry out the survey with a grant from Chinese government.The Mou signed on August 13, 2013, spearheaded by the then CS Najib Balala and GETI president Jia Xuetian, did not materialise as the project failed to take off because of lack of funds.GETI was to undertake an aerial survey for between 24 and 36 months at an estimated cost of $70 million (Sh7.2 billion).A ministry official told the Star the CS is concerned that funding of the project by a foreign entity could compromise Kenya's minerals, as data will be obtained by a foreign firm.Last month, the Parliamentary Budget and Appropriations Committee also questioned the move, saying the survey should be conducted by Kenyan geologists to secure the country&rsquo;s interests and sovereignty.The latest developments leaves the ministry at limbo having already picked a British consultancy, International GeoScience Services Ltd, to lead the search for a firm to undertake the exercise.IGS, which specialises in geological survey, will partner with Paterson, Grant and Watson Ltd &ndash; a Canadian geophysical consulting, data processing, modelling, interpretation, structural geology and survey management company.Kazungu said a team of 16 Kenyan geologists has started putting in place a manual to guide the process.&ldquo;60 per cent of the document is already done. The contract has been cleared by the Attorney General so we are ready to issue the tender anytime this month,&rdquo; Kazungu said.The Sh3 billion was meant to facilitate the first phase of the national airborne survey.&ldquo;The entire survey will cost between Sh8 billion and Sh10 billion,&rdquo; Kazungu told the Star on the phone.The process has dragged for the last three years. The survey is aimed at identifying mineral deposits and their locations across the country.
