A parliamentary committee is expected to vet retired Anglican Archbishop Eliud Wabukala tomorrow for the position of EACC chairperson.Former chairman Philip Kinisu resigned in August last year after he was linked to Esaki Ltd, which was named in the Sh1.6 billion NYS scandal. The National Assembly Justice and Legal Affairs committee, chaired by Ainabkoi MP Samuel Chepkonga, will vet the cleric. His approval will be historic as he will be the first cleric to head the commission. Chepkonga has urged members to attend the vetting. It will start at 9am at County Hall, Nairobi. Five candidates were shortlisted by the Public Service Commission. President Uhuru Kenyatta nominated Wabukala, 65. He beat William Kirwa, Philemon Mwaisaka, Peter Ondieki, Rose Osoro and Erastus Iguna Esaki , owned by Kinisu&rsquo;s family, was said to have pocketed Sh35 million from fraudulent transactions at NYS. Kinisu did not disclose his involvement in the NYS transactions when Parliament vetted him, posing a possible conflict of interest, which critics said would undermine his war on corruption.
