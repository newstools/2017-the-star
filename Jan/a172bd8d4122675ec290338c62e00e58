I also have good contacts in the Trump administration and that is my first priority,&rdquo; Mbijiwe said.Meru depends on miraa farming and business. For many years, it has been its economic mainstay. Mbijiwe said farmers and traders suffered a huge blow after the crop was banned in the lucrative Europe and US markets. The ban was imposed in 2015. &ldquo;Families are starving, schools have closed and retail shops remain shut. Most families lost their main source of livelihoods after the ban,&rdquo; he said in an interview with the Star. Mbijiwe urged the county government to put in place measures that will safeguard the miraa business.
