Principals in Kakamega have asked the government to speedily disburse free education money to schools to avoid their being auctioned by suppliers.They include Godfrey Owori of St Peter&rsquo;s Mumias Boys High School, Samuel Ogola of Eshinamwenyuli Secondary School, Butere and Constantine Wanyonyi of Mwira Secondary School in Matungu.The principals said they will stick to the government fees guidelines, but urged the Education ministry to hasten release of funds.&ldquo;A lot of projects will stall because there will be no money to manage them, as schools cannot charge extra levies from parents for such projects, which are not budgeted for by the government,&rdquo; Owori said. He said principals&rsquo; input is ignored during education review, yet they play a crucial role.
