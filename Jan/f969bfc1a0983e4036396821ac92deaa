The Kenya Association of Manufacturers and the Kenya Magistrates and Judges Association have rolled out a Commercial Law Guidebook to help companies understand the process of resolving disputes. The manual, based on judicial procedures, will assist law practitioners, the business community and the public to know how they can speed up cases on illicit trade, corruption, tax evasion, distribution of substandard goods and the infringement of intellectual property, whose delay in determination stall development projects. &ldquo;One of the major reasons why we are doing this is to deal with the monster called Backlog. This monster slows and even blocks the entire justice system in some cases,&rdquo; the KMJA president Hedwig Ong&rsquo;udi said. Speaking during the launch, Chief Justice David Maraga said for the country to achieve economic growth, there is need for the judiciary and the business community to work together. KAM chairperson Flora Mutahi termed the guidebook as a milestone for the private sector and the public.
