Health Cabinet Secretary Cleopa Mailu has confirmed that Auditor General Edward Ouko is investigating the alleged theft of Sh5 billion at the ministry. Mailu said the ministry will await the findings and recommendations of the audit but did not specify the time-line within which the report will be ready. &ldquo;The auditor general responded to the ministry&rsquo;s request and had from December 5, 2016, commenced a special audit on the subject matter,&rdquo; Mailu told the Star yesterday.The investigations by the auditor come after a delayed probe by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission. Deputy CEO Michael Mubea promised to conclude the probe within a month of his visit to the ministry more than two months ago.The probe was triggered after a leaked audit by the ministry&rsquo;s internal auditor Bernard Muchere revealed billions of shillings were lost through irregular payments.The cash was paid to companies associated with influential personalities in the political and business class.On October 28 last year, Mubea led commission investigators into the Health ministry after media reports of the irregular payments and immediately announced a special EACC team to investigate.&ldquo;We have commenced fresh investigations in response to the media reports that contained allegations of irregular payments,&rdquo; Mubea said then.Though he promised to have the special team conclude the probe within a month, the Star is informed the commission is yet to start the probe.&ldquo;The interest this scandal generates is just huge. The people adversely mentioned in the scandal are another challenge,&rdquo; a senior official at the EACC said.Yesterday, Mubea would not speak on the issue and instead directed us to his boss, Halakhe Waqo, who was unavailable for comment.&ldquo;I am on leave until the 9th of this month. Can you get the CEO, who has the latest position?&rdquo; Mubea said. During the much-publicised visit, Mubea said he had requested the Health CS to provide all the required documentation to his team.&ldquo;We have written to the minister calling for documents that touch on various companies that have been adversely mentioned in the report. The whole purpose of the special team is to gather all the documents so that we can have them ready,&rdquo; he said. The CS also told the Star the ministry has so far cooperated and provided all the documents requested by the EACC to facilitate the investigations.
