Opposition chief Raila Odinga has urged his supporters to turn out in large numbers and register as voters to guarantee his presidential victory.The second face of a month-long mass voter registration begins today.Raila said he has already &ldquo;subdued&rdquo; the Jubilee administration politically, and the only sure way of dislodging it from power is through overwhelmingly voting against against it on August 8.&ldquo;If you want to be Agwambo&rsquo;s soldier, you must have weapons ready at your disposal to send Jubilee home,&rdquo; he said.The former premier said the constant abuses hurled at him by the Jubilee government over his unrelenting efforts to expose wanton corruption and other ills will not cow him.He dismissed Deputy President William Ruto's remarks that the opposition is "clueless and rudderless".&ldquo;It is like a normal person chasing after a mad man who has picked his clothes along the lake shores while bathing because it would be hard to differentiate between the dtwo," Raila said.He was speaking in Sakwa on Saturday during the burial of Prof Rok Ajulu, a renowned scholar who taught in South Africa.Siaya Senator James Orengo said a large voter turnout will usher in a new dawn for Kenyans yearning for equal resource distribution.He said as the opposition, they are clueless because they do not know where the proceeds of the Euro Bond disappeared to.&ldquo;We are leaderless because we do not know how to lead in corruption,&rdquo; Orengo said, apparently mocking Ruto's statement.Nominated MP Oburu Oginga said President Uhuru Kenyatta has put more focus on Raila at the expense of discharging his duties as President.He said instead of lecturing the opposition, Uhuru should concentrate on addressing the many problems affecting the Jubilee administration.Oburu said the President should respect Kenyans, who are tired of corruption and politics of exclusion.He said the opposition enjoys the fallouts in Jubilee because disgruntled leaders are joining them.Oburu urged elected leaders and aspirants to support the mass voter registration by ensuring their supporters register in large numbers.Other leaders present were Ida Odinga, MPs Gideon Ochanda (Bondo), Millie Odhiambo (Mbita) and Siaya woman representative Christine Ombaka.C
