Adelle Onyango, one of the most prominent and popular radio hosts in Kenya, has revealed her love for ink. She doesn&rsquo;t look the tattoo type right? Wrong.While not many people might be aware, Adelle is a big fan of tattoos and if you follow her on social media, you might have noticed a few photos where she&rsquo;s flaunting them. Lucky for her, they are all on the upper part of her body where revealing them would not brand her indecent.Well, I got the chance to sit with Adelle who took me through each tattoo and though she prefers keeping them on the down low, she is proud of them.The humble and exuberant former singer gets emotional as she talks about one of the tattoos done in honour of her mum, who sadly passed away after succumbing to breast cancer in 2012. Check it out below; The Kiss FM breakfast host's latest tattoo is inscribed on her bicep, which reads; &ldquo;God Dwells Within Me As Me&rdquo;and is so far one of her longest and most visible tattoos yet. Even though most of her fans may think it&rsquo;s meaning is just Godly, there is more to it.
