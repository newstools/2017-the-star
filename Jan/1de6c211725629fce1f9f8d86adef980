The High Court has barred the government from deporting two Sudanese allied to former South Sudan Vice President Riek Machar.The two went missing in Nairobi. Judge Luka Kimaru (pictured) also directed Safaricom and all other mobile phone service providers to give data on the missing persons&rsquo; communication.The directives were made after lawyer Eddy Orinda told the court he had reliable information deportation plans were underway. Orinda was instructed by Dong Samuel Luak and Aggrey Izbon&rsquo;s families to inquire into their whereabouts as they had not been seen since January 23.Dong and Izbon worked in senior capacities in the Sudan People&rsquo;s Liberation Movement in-Opposition. The Human Rights Watch condemned their deportation, noting it would be illegal as the two were facing torture, inhumane and degrading treatment and arbitrary detention in their country.Orinda yesterday told Justice Kimaru it is highly possible that if the court does not intervene, his clients will be deported to the war-torn country and this poses serious ramifications to their safety and would violate refugee status, which is protected by international laws.The court heard that Dong and Izbon have been in the custody of the Kenya Police, pending their &ldquo;unlawful deportation&rdquo;.But the state denied having the two in their custody. &ldquo;My clients are citizens of South Sudan with official refugee status in Kenya. They were unlawfully detained on January 23,&rdquo; Orinda said.
