He said he has also beefed up the defence, bringing in Moffat Liuva and Zablon Khaemba, who are former student of Muhudu and Ebwali Secondary School respectively.&ldquo;We have also signed Derrick Mwanzi, a left back from Western Stima,&rdquo; Manoah said after team&rsquo;s training at Kidundu Stadium.
