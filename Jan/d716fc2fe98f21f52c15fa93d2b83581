Hundreds of pastoralists from Garissa county have started moving with their animals in search of water and pasture.This has raised fears of conflicts. Several herders who spoke to the Star said they are worried about their lives and their livestock because of drought.&ldquo;Pasture is diminishing in all the corners of the county. Our animals are also dying en mass and we also face starvation,&rdquo; Abdullahi Mohamed, a resident of Banane in Lagdera constituency, said.&ldquo;Our biggest worry now is that conflict might occur between pastrolists as we scramble for the little pasture and water available in the few boreholes.&rdquo;The herders are moving with cows, sheep and goats to Tana River and Lamu counties.Women and children are the most affected by the drought.Mohamed said he has no problem walking for kilometres in search of water and pasture, but his biggest concern is moving with his family.He some elderly members, women and children cannot cope with the long distance.Abdi Mohamed, a resident of Balambala, said they have not received any help.&ldquo;We are yet to get any assistance from anybody. All we hear is that the government is buying weak animals from pastoralists. I have several of them but I haven&rsquo;t seen anybody asking me about them,&rdquo; he said.On the outskirts of Modogashe town, residents have dug up some dry boreholes hoping to get water.Area MP Mohamed Shidiye said on Saturday the situation is "already out of hand".&ldquo;The government needs to walk the talk and come to the aid of our people, otherwise we risk having refugees as a result of drought,&rdquo; he said.Lagdera deputy subcounty education officer Ibrahim Odowa said enrolment in schools has reduced.He said education officials have come up with mobile schools that follow the pastoralists.
