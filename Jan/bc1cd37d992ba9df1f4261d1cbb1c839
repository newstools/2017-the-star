Universities who dish out degrees to unqualified students will be shut and the certificates recalled, Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang&rsquo;i has warned.Quoting the yet-to-be-released Commission for University Education preliminary report, Matiang&rsquo;i said it had revealed that some of the universities in the country were admitting students who don&rsquo;t meet the minimum required mark of C+ and above to their degree programmes.Even though proliferation of universities and commercialisation of higher education has improved access to education, academicians and employers have raised eyebrows over the saturation of university education.The institutions churn out graduates poorly prepared for the labour market, thus the announcement by the CS will offer some hope. &ldquo;We are going to take action. It will be a difficult and painful reform. But it is necessary. I hope the public will understand and support us,&rdquo; Matiang&rsquo;i told Citizen TV during an interview on Sunday. He said the preliminary report shows there are universities admitting students and politicians with below C+ to pursue degree programmes. Apart from rampant issue of missing marks, he said there are some universities with no records of their graduands. &ldquo;Where it [CUE] is not satisfied, they should recall the degrees,&rdquo; he said.
