The state department for Maritime and Shipping Affairs is counting on a training partnership with danish shipping company- Det Forenede Dampskibs-Selskab to boost local marine cadets' capacity.The department signed a five year agreement with the shipping line on January 12, which allows Kenyan marine engineering and nautical science cadets to clock in 12 months of seagoing service.The 12 months of service is a mandatory prerequisite for a cadet to attain professional accreditation in the maritime industry either as an engineer or as a navigating officer. &ldquo;We are really counting on this and other capacity building initiatives to boost the sectors' productivity .The ministry plans to expand maritime training so as to equip Kenyan youth with the skills to enable them access seafaring jobs in the local and global shipping industry ,&rdquo; maritime affairs Principal Secretary Nancy Karigithu said. Out of five institutions in the country that offer marine engineering and nautical science courses, only Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology offers a bachelor of science degree in marine engineering, while the Technical University of Mombasa is the only institution offering a diploma in nautical science and marine engineering. Lack of locally owned ships has stalled students' interest in the maritime sector as they are unable to secure the required 12 month shipboard training. &ldquo;This will help us take advantage of our strategic geographical location and resources which provide us with opportunity to increase our share of involvement in the maritime sector as well as help us create a marine manufacturing market, including ship repair, rig repair and refurbishment as well as boat-building,&rdquo; said Karigithu.
