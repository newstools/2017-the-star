Muslim clerics at the Coast have cautioned the Supreme Council of Kenya Muslims secretary general Adan Wachu against remarks that will divide the members.Coast regional coordinator Sheikh Muhdhar Khitammy said Wachu recently called for a press conference and condemned his deputy Sheikh Hassan ole Naado, accusing him of engaging politics.Naado is said to have talked about Kenya&rsquo;s politics of inheritance, in which children of veteran politicians get to power because of their parents&rsquo; influence.Wachu said Naado does not speak on behalf of Supkem.But on Tuesday, Khitammy and other Coast Supkem officials said Naado is the council's national deputy secretary and is allowed to speak on its behalf.He said Wachu is trying to bring confusion in the council to interfere with the national elections, which will take place at the end of January.Wachu wants to maintain his SG position, but he is afraid that Naado is a threat and might trounce him, if the elections are called today.&ldquo;The national office has overstayed in office. We have not conducted the Supkem national election since 2009. We shall not allow any person to derail our programme this year,&rdquo; Khitammy said.The regional elections (grassroots to provincial level), have been ongoing since last November and the entire Coast region has peacefully voted for its officials.&ldquo;Why is Wachu now coming up with petty issues to just try and discredit other officials? Naado is his deputy and is allowed by the constitution to speak on behalf of Supkem. We are sensing that Wachu is trying to frustrate other officials so that elections are called off,&rdquo; Khitammy said.Sheikh Khalfan Ali, Mombasa region secretary, said Wachu wants to postpone the national elections to December.&ldquo;He wants the election to be held after the general election in August. Supkem has its own constitution, but has not been followed for several years as the SG wants to cling on to power,&rdquo; he said.
