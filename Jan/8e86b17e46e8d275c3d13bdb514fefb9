"I will not rest until i know that Too was not assassinated. Its not bad to know the truth," Lilan said on Friday. Lilan claims that circumstances before and after the death on December 31, 2016 suggest that Too may have been killed.He argues that Too's burial was being hastened yet results of a postmortem done by Chief government pathologist Jahhanesen Oduor cannot be relied on conclusively.He wants samples taken from Too's body for an independent probe into the death. Lilan also wants remains of Too buried at the home of his first wife Mary Too.The court will hear the matter on January 12th.Also: Woman says Mark Too was her son's father, wants burial stopped
