Global payments technology company Visa has partnered with Atlas Mara to encourage the adoption of electronic cash transactions in Sub Saharan Africa.In the agreement signed last Thursday, Atlas Mara's banks will leverage on the existing Visa payment platforms such as mVisa and Visa direct to allow their customers convenient and secure transactions. &ldquo;Our partnership enables Atlas Mara to deploy Visa's global assets and payment solutions, and has the potential to be transformational for commerce, mobile payments and financial inclusion across Africa,&rdquo; Visa Sub-Saharan Africa Group country manager Andrew Torre said.Atlas Mara chief digital officer Chidi Okpala said: "Atlas Mara will be able to offer a suite of digital and mobile payment solutions for the everyday payment needs of our expanding customer base across Africa." Visa launched mVisa in 2016, a mobile payment service that brings for the first time in Africa an interoperable, versatile and secure mobile payment solution, powered by Visa and its partner financial institutions.With mVisa, consumers can directly access their funds in their bank accounts to pay merchants (person-to-merchant) or individuals (person-to-person).The consumers and merchants do not need to be customers of the same bank or mobile operator.
