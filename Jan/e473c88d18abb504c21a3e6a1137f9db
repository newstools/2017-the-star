Kwale ODM leaders have warned the Jubilee administration against using police to intimidate the opposition in the run-up to the August 8 election.Police are not the government's personal property, they said and condemned the "harassment" of Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho.&ldquo;There is nothing that Joho and other MPs did to warrant their detention. Jubilee wants to take us back to the Moi era when police were used as personal property," said Nominated MP Zuleikha Juma.Juma, who addressed the media in Diani on Saturday, said the government must respect the constitution.She was with National Council of Imams and Scholars chairman Sheikh Hamisi Banda, Hussein Goza, Shabaan Abdulah and Amana Jirani.Accusing Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya of celebrating Joho's tribulations, Juma said leaders enjoying the "defilement" of the constitution should be avoided.&ldquo;We know Jubilee wants to cause instability in the coastal region to disrupt voter registration. That will not happen because we know their plan,&rdquo; she said.Banda warned that arresting opposition leaders will put the country at risk amid preparations for the election.&ldquo;It shows Jubilee is a big coward, that is against the spirit of the new constitution which we fought for. A plot by the government to take the country to a single-party era will not be permitted," he said,The cleric said Mvurya should not celebrate as his fate will be sealed after the poll.&ldquo;Nobody in Kwale will vote for Jubilee so Mvurya should prepare to home and stop celebrating when his colleagues are harassed by the government,&rdquo; he said.Juma and Banda did not give details of what Mvurya allegedly said or did, but the Governor is an ODM rebel who has been critical of Joho.Read: Joho, Ruwa and Mwakwere are plotting my downfall - MvuryaODM acting Secretary general Agnes Zani earlier said Joho's alleged arrest alongside two MPs on Friday was aimed at intimidating opposition leaders.The Governor and MPs Abdulswamad Nassir (Mvita) and Rashid Bedzimba (Kisauni) were allegedly detained at Mombasa CID headquarters.Joho, who went to visit a relative arrested earlier in the day, is said to have caused a disturbance.More on this: Joho now enemy of the state for defying Jubilee, says ODMBut Coast regional coordinator Nelson Marwa said Joho was not arrested and that he only stayed at the police station to cause chaos.He said the outspoken county boss, who caused a frenzy yesterday night, faked his arrest after police refused to release the suspect.Read more: [VIDEO] Joho wanted suspected drug baron released, was not arrested, says Marwa
