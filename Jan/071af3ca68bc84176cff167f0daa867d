Jubilee politician Suleiman Shahbal has said he will storm Kongowea market at the end of this month and take unspecified action if the Nairobi government does not allocate stalls to traders.He said yesterday, &ldquo;I will not sit and watch as efforts made by President Uhuru Kenyatta to upgrade the market are eroded by cheap and unsubstantiated politics.&rdquo; Shahbal said the county is reluctant to allocate stalls for political reasons. &ldquo;Some people are sabotaging the project because they think the national government has been frustrating it,&rdquo; he said. The government pumped Sh444 million into the completion of the retail centre&rsquo;s construction. Shahbal said the county is planning to allocate stalls to cronies of politicians. He said more than Sh3 million is transacted daily in the market but the county has nothing to show for it.
