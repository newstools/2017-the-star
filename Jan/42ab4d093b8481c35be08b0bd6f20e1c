The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission has promised to clean up the voter register as a month-long mass voter registration starts today.The IEBC targets more than six million eligible voters. Chief executive officer Ezra Chiloba yesterday said the commission will start cleaning up the register in June, 60 days to the August 8 general election.This will ensure it is free of dead and underage voters, an illegal segment the opposition has blamed for rigged elections.Chiloba said the IEBC will engage the Interior ministry&rsquo;s Registration of Deaths and Births department to expunge dead voters.&ldquo;Phase two of the mass voter registration kicks off on January 16 [today] up to February 14 as the commission targets to register 22 million voters before the August polls,&rdquo; he said.Chiloba responded to questions at a Nairobi hotel after unveiling the exercise. &ldquo;The IEBC will also open the provisional register for verification using biometric voter data 120 days before the election and close 90 days after the election,&rdquo; he said.Chiloba said the mass registration will cost Sh2.1 billion. &ldquo;As of June 30, 2016, a total of 15,857,185 voters had been uploaded in the database pending verification and certification,&rdquo; Chiloba said.He said nine million people issued with IDs are not registered as voters, according to government agencies. &ldquo;We have come up with a communication plan to reach them and other potential voters before and during the exercise,&rdquo; Chiloba said.&ldquo;We will use all platforms available, including community radio to reach to them.&rdquo;Voters who want to change their stations will have to travel to the constituency coordinators&rsquo; office to transfer to the new stations.Chiloba said the IEBC will deploy 7,793 BVR kits countrywide at the ward level. One kit will only be used for a maximum of 15 days. The distribution criteria will be based on geographical considerations.&ldquo;The proposal is to have the kits opened at the constituency level to allow registration across the constituency. The kits movement schedule will be shared with residents and voter transfers will be done at the constituency level,&rdquo; he said.
