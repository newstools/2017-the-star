Some people say that you can take everything else from an indigenous resident of Central Kenya but not their love for a decent livelihood that earns them good money. Anything that sounds like a threat to this ability to do business and make that money.If the numbers by the IEBC on the first week of voter registration are anything to go by, then Central Kenya faces a fear that it believes it can block using the vote. This fear, which has seen Central Kenya lead in the voter registration turnout, is that of a Raila Odinga presidency.Many Central Kenyans will tell you that Raila does not seem like a bad man, but they all harbor the fear that he could interfere with their lives &ndash; and especially their businesses. Raila has been sold to Central Kenya as an individual not ready to tolerate others and only keen at driving a Luo revenge agenda against the Kikuyu.This fear of a Raila presidency in Central Kenya is however not driven by years of his action or inaction. There are so many things in Raila's political history that they make residents of Central Kenya fear his rise to the highest office in the land.For instance, a lot of people from Central Kenya believe that Raila was the cause of the 2007/08 post-election violence that saw many of them who live in Rift Valley lose their land and property. Others believe his statements ahead of the 2007 election are what led to some residents in Kibera refusing to pay rent to their Kikuyu landlords.There is also another group that believes Raila was the reason why President Uhuru Kenyatta ended up at the International Criminal Court over the post-election violence. This has been unforgivable and was the reason Central Kenya came out in large numbers to ensure that Uhuru did not only not go to The Hague (in the sense of not being jailed) but Raila does not get to be President.Raila's recent comments have also not helped the situation when he said that Uhuru and his deputy William Ruto should have been held in cells while their ICC cases continued. There are those who then believe that Raila could use the Presidency to jail Uhuru and they cannot allow this to happen.The people of Central Kenya are not ready to experiment with a Raila presidency.
