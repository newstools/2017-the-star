The Cord opposition has urged DPP Keriako Tobiko to charge National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale for what he called threats to a High Court judge.Cord says if the DPP does not prosecute Duale within seven days, it will take things into its own hands and institute private prosecution. Duale threatened to table a motion in Parliament to discuss George Odunga.Cord&rsquo;s letter is dated December 28, which means the seven-days ultimatum has expired.Through lawyer Apollo Mboya, Cord raised the issue of Duale&rsquo;s possible prosecution for contempt of court.Odunga said if the coalition wants to pursue a contempt case, it should file documents in court. This means the ball is in Cord&rsquo;s court to make good its threat by filing a case.On December 22, Duale said, &ldquo;And I want to tell one judge Odunga that when we open on January 24, I will introduce a motion to discuss you. We will expose you. You cannot be a member of the bench and play tribal politics.&rdquo; Odunga was prepared to rule on Cord&rsquo;s application to stop Parliament from debating the amendments to the election laws.Cord believes the statement constitutes criminal contempt. The coalition says the immunity the politician enjoys within the Parliament compound is only with regard to performance of his legislative duties and does not extend to criminal culpability.It says Duale&rsquo;s comments tend to scandalise and lower judicial authority, prejudices and interferes with the administration of justice, which ought to be stopped as soon as possible.Mboya was in court yesterday for the mention of a case in which Cord is challenging amendments to the election laws. Cord terms the amendments illegal and wants them annulled. It sued the National Assembly, its Speaker, Senate and its Speaker, as well as the Attorney General.Duale&rsquo;s remarks were condemned by the judiciary, the Law Society of Kenya and the Judicial Service Commission. The case will be heard on February 28.
