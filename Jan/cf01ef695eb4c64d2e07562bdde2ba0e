Insurance companies insist that proposed changes to insurance law to reduce the period for settling claims to a month from three months will be difficult to implement.The players and the regulator, Insurance Regulatory Authority, have started the process of phasing out a strict resettlement procedure, which has been blamed for protracted delays.Underwriters say there are challenges in developing a simple formula for handling complex claims largely in long-term business where settlement documentation may take three to four months. When the 30-day plan is fully implemented, IRA says, the claim payment period will start counting from the day the claim is lodged, and not when all documents have been filed by the policyholder. Acting commissioner of insurance Godfrey Kiptum said the supervision of insurers is underway to ensure they put in place systems and processes where claims will be settled in the shortest time in order to protect policy holders. &ldquo;All the insurers have been inspected on this and those with challenges have been identified and are being subjected to close supervision to ensure that claims are settled on time,&rdquo; he told the star via email.&ldquo;The authority has also rolled out a number of guidelines to companies geared towards ensuring that the rights of insurance consumers are protected. Chief executive officer of ICEA Lion General Insurance Steven Oluoch said a shorter resettlement period will also affect the quality of investigations into claims, opening up loopholes for fraud cartels.&ldquo;That proposal is a bit impractical. The 90-day timeline is what we would like to retain,&rdquo; he said in a phone interview. Only about a fifth of the insurance firms are able to process claims in 30 days on average, according to an industry report &ndash; Insurance Industry &amp; Performance Trends &ndash; that was published by IRA in June.&ldquo;Delays are experienced mainly when there is a dispute. That means the resettlement of claim may extend past the deadline even with a law in place,&rdquo; AAR managing director Caroline Munene said.
