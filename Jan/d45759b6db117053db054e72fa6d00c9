Transport Cabinet Secretary James Macharia (pictured) has said the government may award road building tenders to foreign firms following &ldquo;consistent disappointments&rdquo; by local contractors.He said the local contractors complain the government has been awarding major contracts to foreign companies, yet they consistently do shoddy work. Macharia cited Nyoro Construction Company, which has not completed the Gitugi-Mioro road in Murang&rsquo;a county since 2013.Last month, President Uhuru Kenyatta gave the company a month to complete the project or the government would cancel the contract. Uhuru, who was commissioning development projects in Murang&rsquo;a and Central region, said he has received numerous complaints from residents about the delayed project.Residents received the ultimatum with enthusiasm, hoping the road would finally be completed, but the contractor is still working at a snail&rsquo;s pace. Macharia on Saturday said he will visit the project in two weeks to assess the progress and determine the next course of action.&ldquo;We have been working very hard as a government to implement development projects and we will not allow contractors to derail our agenda,&rdquo; he said. The CS said if the contractor does not adhere to the President&rsquo;s directive, the contract will be cancelled and awarded to another contractor.Residents have held numerous demonstrations, protesting against the contractor. Macharia said the government s cancelled a contract awarded to Lee Construction Company in 2012 to construct the 25km Makomboki-Mairi-Gatie road in Kigumo constituency. He said the contractor has only completed 15 per cent of the Sh1.5 billion contract. But he had been paid Sh257 million before the contract was cancelled and awarded to a Chinese company.Last April, Macharia visited the project and gave the contractor until March this year to complete the road. This was after residents blocked area MP Jamleck Kamau from leaving his Makomboki home, demanding to know why the contractor was taking too long to complete the work.
