Reigning national champions United States International University take on Equity Hawks in the play-off semi finals Game One at Nyayo Stadium gymnasium this weekend.The matches were pushed forward due to the participation of USIU and Kenya Ports Authority participation in the Fiba Africa Women Club championships in Maputo, Mozambique last November. KPA finished seventh while USIU was placed ninth.The &lsquo;Flames&rsquo; who finished fourth in the regular season didn&rsquo;t have a good year but can still rise to the occasion when it matters. In Sarah Chan and Cynthia Irankunda, they have two players capable of causing havoc. Merab Otieno and Melissa Akinyi will also be key.Equity &lsquo;Hawks&rsquo; are favoured to storm to their first ever finals this year. They finished second behind KPA in the regular season and have Mercy Wanyama, Hilda Indasi, Samba Mjomba, Linda Mfuchi and Shialei Shani to bank on.At the Makande Welfare hall in Mombasa, KPA will be going for the kill when they host Co-operative Bank of Kenya. The porters, the only unbeaten side the entire season, have taken 2-0 series lead and need only to post one game in the three matches to make it to the finals.The men&rsquo;s finals will throw off next weekend when Co-op Bank tackle KPA in what is expected to be an explosive show down. Co-op shut out Thunder 3-1 while KPA defied all the odds to dismiss reigning men champions Ulinzi Warriors by the same margin.
