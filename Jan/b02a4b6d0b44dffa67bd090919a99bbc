The transport authority has clarified that traffic offenders chose to carry placards as punishment during the December holiday.The authority handed out signs with the words: "Kindly observe lane discipline, don't be like me", at the Sachangwan black spot on Nakuru-Eldoret highway.Drivers found violating traffic laws wore reflective jackets and waved the signage for others while standing at strategic positions.Read: Traffic offenders at Sachang'wan black spot forced by NTSA to carry 'observe lane' signIt had been reported that they were forced to do so but NTSA road safety deputy director John Munya said this information was false and misplaced.&ldquo;We did not force anyone to do anything. We gave them options, to go to court or lift the placards, and they chose to lift the placards,&rdquo; Muya said on Wednesday."The authority is not out to punish anyone. What we are doing is sensitising drivers to maintain discipline on roads."Muya said the authority engaged in a series of activities aimed at ensuring maximum safety for drivers and pedestrians, especially in areas marked as black spots."We let the drivers out of their cars and educated them on why not to speed and why they should maintain lane discipline after which we let them weigh their options," he said.NTSA was criticised for the action, some social media users saying it was humiliating, intimidating and lacked legal backing therefore the authority risked expensive suits.
