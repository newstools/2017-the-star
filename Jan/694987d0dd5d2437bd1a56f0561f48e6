Orange Telkom women’s hockey team have a chance to clinch the Kenya Hockey Union league title a record 20th time when they take on Amira Sailors in their last match of the 2016 season at the City Park Stadium on Sunday. The league leaders who boast of six unbeaten matches and one draw with 19 points, will come up against a debutant Amira Sailors, who are placed third on standing with 14 points from four unbeaten matches, two draws and one loss. The side, coached by Jos Openda, will retain the trophy if they win against the bankers or get a draw of any kind. However, a loss to the Sailors will give a chance to their arch rivals Strathmore University to scoop the title from them. The students, who are second on standing with 17 points, will play win-less and bottom placed Daystar University on Sunday in the earlier match at the same venue. Telkom coach Openda said he was aware that their opponents will be out to spoil their party but said they will not going to give them that satisfaction. He said: “The fate is in our own hands. A win against Sailors will see us retain the trophy for the 20th time and that’s what we are routing for. The players are psyched up and we are going all out for the win.” In the other women’s league match today, last year’s KHU women’s league runners up Sliders battle Kenyatta University. Telkom met sailors in Sana tournament in Mombasa and won 3-0. “We are using the league matches to prepare for the forthcoming Africa Club Championship to be staged in Nairobi in January,” he said. On Sunday, Technical University play Multi media University in the men’s national league as they seek to extend lead on standing while Impala entertain Thika Rovers. Parkroad Tigers play Wazalendo Youth in the men’s national league. In the men’s Premier League, Sikh Union cross swords with Parkroad Badgers in the fight for position 11 and 12 while Western Jaguars lock horns with Kenyatta University for position 13 and 14 respectively.
