Kenya and the United Nations have agreed to reset their fractured relations caused by a dispute over military deployment in South Sudan.The deal to reset relations was reached at a bilateral meeting between President Uhuru Kenyatta and the new UN secretary general Ant&oacute;nio Guterres in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa.The meeting, the first in a series of meetings between the UN chief and African leaders, focused on peacekeeping, peace and security, with focus on Kenya&rsquo;s role, as well as events in South Sudan, Sudan, Somalia and Burundi.&ldquo;I want the United Nations to be reconciled with Kenya. Let us make a fresh start. Kenya is a very important player in the region and I feel that we have to work together to secure peace and security. Let us put the past behind us,&rdquo; Guterres told Uhuru.&ldquo;We want to move forward. We have full confidence in Kenya&rsquo;s military. As a sign of our confidence in the Kenya Defence Forces, and in the Kenyan government, the UN would like to offer Kenya the Darfur command.&rdquo;Uhuru said he agreed to reset the relations and would look forward to senior officials from both sides meeting in Addis Ababa to work out details of the new arrangements.Guterres also invited Uhuru to join a small group of global leaders &ndash; drawn from countries with a strong democratic tradition &ndash; he is convening as &ldquo;champions of accountability&rdquo; in areas such as peacekeeping. The President accepted the invitation.Kenya withdrew its troops from a UN mission in South Sudan last year after its mission commander was withdrawn without consultation with the Kenyan leadership.Uhuru repeated yesterday that such an affront to Kenya&rsquo;s dignity was unwelcome because it conveyed the message that the country&rsquo;s efforts in keeping the region secure went unrecognised.Guterres and Uhuru also discussed Somalia and Burundi. Guterres said it is necessary to continue rebuilding Somalia so the country could practically stand on its own feet again.Responding to Uhuru&rsquo;s concerns that the African Union Mission in Somalia needs to be effective, Guterres said the UN has no plans of asking Burundi troops to leave Somalia, but wants the Burundi leadership to show greater transparency in its dealings.On South Sudan, Guterres urged Uhuru to continue being engaged, and to urge the leadership of Africa&rsquo;s newest nation to pursue inclusivity as a way of sustaining peace. Uhuru also sought support from the new UN chief for the UN Office at Nairobi and its key agencies, the UN Environment Programme and UN Habitat.
