A $3 billion (Sh311.76 billion) dispute between two adversarial governments will come to a head in an English court today when Russia and Ukraine meet for a first hearing in their legal battle over a politically charged eurobond. The debt at the heart of the dispute was sold in late December 2013 by then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich to Russia, less than two months before his Moscow-backed government was ousted by street protests that swept the ex-Soviet republic. Fast-forward through a pro-Western change of government in Kiev, Russia&rsquo;s annexation of Ukraine&rsquo;s Crimea region and an International Monetary Fund bailout for Ukraine involving a restructuring of sovereign, hard currency bonds.Those bonds, restructured to pull the near-bankrupt Ukraine back from the brink, were chiefly held by private investors &ndash; aside from $3 billion held by the Russian government.
