The future of two IEBC nominees faced with integrity questions now lies with MPs after the Selection Panel that interviewed and recommended their hiring asked legislators to probe fresh allegations against them.The nine-member Selection Panel on IEBC, chaired by Bernadette Musundi, yesterday blamed the public for failing to provide a memorandum reported in the media, questioning the suitability of nominees Wafula Chebukati (chairperson) and Consolata Nkatha (commissioner) before interviews for thorough scrutiny.The team said names of successful candidates forwarded to President Uhuru Kenyatta had no integrity questions because there was no single public petition against them and government agencies, including the EACC, KRA, LSK and the DCI cleared them.The panel gave the public seven days to provide information on their suitability. Chebukati was former EACC chairman Philip Kinisu&rsquo;s lawyer. Kinisu was hounded out of office for allegedly pocketing Sh35 million from fraudulent National Youth Service transactions. There are concerns Chebukati could also be a beneficiary of the cash, although there is no evidence yet.Nkatha is on the spot for allegedly having an active criminal court case in which she is accused of defrauding the Museums of Kenya of Sh280 million.&ldquo;The selection panel wishes to reiterate that regarding Chebukati, the only memorandum received was one recommending him for appointment from Pwani University management. He was also cleared by various agencies in the reports received,&rdquo; Musundi said. She pointed out that the panel did not receive any single memorandum from the public against Nkatha.&ldquo;Had the allegations contained in the media been brought to the attention of the selection panel at the appropriate time, the panel would have, as it did with respect to all other information received, brought the information to the attention of the two applicants before their interviews. The information would have had an impact on the decision of the panel,&rdquo; Musundi said.National Assembly Justice and Legal Affairs committee chaired by Ainabkoi MP Samuel Chepkonga is expected to vet the seven nominees for Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission on Tuesday next week. They include Chebukati, Nkatha, Abdi Guliye, Boya Molu, Margaret Mwachanya, Paul Kurgat and Roselyn Akombe.
