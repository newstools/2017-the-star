The Mombasa assembly on Thursday was in an uproar after majority leader Hamisi Mwidani (pictured) failed to issue a statement on famine in Mwakirunge ward. MCA Enoch Mwadziwe on Thursday last week asked for a statement on measures to mitigate the famine. But Hamisi said with the death of nominated MCA Serah Nyamvula and Cord leader Raila Odinga&rsquo;s voter registration campaigns, he did not have time to attend to the matter. This angered MCAs, who accused him of taking the issue lightly.
