Questionable expenditures have become a nightmare for Homa Bay Governor Cyprian Awiti as aspirants, including a sitting MP named the best in CDF management, line up to unseat him.Awiti, the ex-country director of Marie Stopes Kenya, and a known philanthropist is facing the battle of his life amid audit queries, which his opponents have capitalised on in their campaigns and attacks against the incumbent.Before becoming governor, Awiti 65, was known for his participation in harambees that helped build several schools and educate the poor, not just in his Karachuonyo backyard, but also in the entire Nyanza.This made him have an easy run for governor in 2013, when nearly all his opponents today backed his bid. He won with a convincing lead.But things have now changed. His former supporters are now opponents, and a ridding on a new and different narrative: Accountability, or lack thereof.&ldquo;Reelecting the incumbent will be a disaster. Despite the county receiving Sh25 billion since devolution started, there is still nothing to show. Even the basics such as addressing water shortage have not been addressed,&rdquo; Kasipul MP Oyugi Magwanga, an aspirant for governor, told the Star.Kasipul was named the best constituency nationally in the management of the National Government Constituency Development Fund. He says this proves his capacity to manage Homa Bay in a better way.Besides Magwanga, other aspirants are there is ex-National Intelligence Service Finance boss Sammy Wakiaga, Technical University of Kenya administrator Ochieng&rsquo; Kanyadudi and Enosh Bolo, a management consultant and strategy expert .However, despite the onslaught by his opponents, Awiti says he is proud that despite several challenges, he has delivered on a number of promises he made in 2013.He lists the tarmacking of the 33km Kadongo-Gendia road, employment of 1,272 ECD teachers, establishment of Tom Mboya University College, and gravelling of over 480km road network across the 40 wards.&ldquo;Through a partnership with the Kenya Airports Authority, the county has managed to renovate and operationalise Kabunde Airstrip, which currently operates five commercial passenger flights between Homa Bay and Nairobi,&rdquo; the governor's communication office told the Star.Ironically, the Kadongo-Gendia road cited by the governor as among his achievements has been a subject of controversy with the Auditor General questioning the expenditure of over Sh123 million.The contract was awarded to American-based construction company, M/S Oasis Group International and was canceled after being paid over Sh110 million.Another Sh13 million had been paid to GA-Consultant.&ldquo;There is massive fiscal indiscipline characterised by failure to implement levers for enhancing internal revenue generation, corruption and poorly prioritised projects. This is attributed to the current administration&rsquo;s failure to put in place structures, systems and people capability to facilitate effective service delivery,&rdquo; Bolo, the managing director of Maxworth Associates Ltd, told the Star.Besides the politics of development, the number of registered voters in the aspirants' hometurfs is also likely to influence the result of the polls.Awiti comes from Karachuonyo and will definitely bag the subcounty's 56,178 registered votes, while Kanyadudi is banking on the 57,576 votes in his home subcounty, Ndiwa.Wakiaga, popularly known as &ldquo;Wuod Ruoth&rdquo; (son of a king) hopes to ring fence Mbita's 36,916 and Suba's 32,437 votes.Magwanga is banking on the Kasipul's 39,747 and Kabondo Kasipul's 35,203 votes.Bolo comes from Rangwe subcounty and could garner its 33,413 votes.This leaves Homa Bay town as the only subcounty without an aspirant and could be the swing vote.Like the incumbent, Wakiaga is big in charity and has helped initiate several development projects in Nyanza.He has also invested heavily in the ferry business that has spurred business around Lake Victoria &ndash;&ndash; increasing cargo and passenger movement, and an upsurge in investments.&ldquo;I believe my 28 years experience in the civil service will be a good catch for my people ... and the people themselves are the trigger of my candidacy. They have felt that I can take them to the next level as governor,&rdquo; Wakiaga told the Star shortly after his resignation from the civil service in August last year.Awiti also names the installation of solar-powered street lights in Homa Bay and Oyugis towns as among his successes.&ldquo;The county government has through its ministry of Energy installed a total of 650 solar lights in the 40 wards, which has not only helped to improve security in market centres but also extended business hours for small-scale traders,&rdquo;the governor said.The county through a partnership with the Kenya Medical Training College also prides itself for establishing two medical training colleges in Rachuonyo and Sindo .&ldquo;Besides his achievements as governor, Awiti hopes to bank on his past development record that spans over three decades not only in the county but in the entire Luo Nyanza,&rdquo; the governor's communication office told the Star.Kanyadudi said he is disappointed with the pace of implementation of devolution in the county and will focus on health as a matter of priority.&ldquo;The county has the longest shoreline on Lake Victoria. It has huge potential for passengers and cargo. This can spur local, inter-county and international trade. We don't have to rely on road transport because most towns here are on the shoreline. Through this, we can trade with Rwanda, Uganda and Tanzania,&rdquo; Kanyadudi said.Magwaga said his priority areas would be availing piped water, providing affordable healthcare, including employing more health personnel, enhancing food security, improving accessibility through roads and empowering the youth.&ldquo;I will provide piped clean and safe water to every institution and household in 24 months or utmost 36 months,&rdquo; Magwanga told the Star.Leaders in the county include, Gladys Wanga (Woman representative), Moses Kajwang (Senator), John Mbadi ( Suba MP) Millie Odhiambo (Mbita MP) and Agostinho Neto (Ndhiwa MP).Others are Peter Kaluma (Homa Bay Town MP), George Oner (Rangwe MP), James Rege (Karachuonyo MP) and Silvance Onyango (MP Kabondo Kasipul) Parliamentary races will also be titanic.Mbadi, who is the ODM chairman will face off with Caroli Omondi, ex-chief of staff to Cord leader Raila Odinga.Omondi also owns Orange House, which houses ODM headquarters.
