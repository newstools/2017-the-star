A cleric has joined seven other hopefuls to unseat Lugari MP Ayub Savula. Nashon Wabwire from Mautuma ward has accused Savula of failing the electorate. Speaking to journalists in his office on Friday, he said as a man of God, he has what it takes to lead the constituency. He said Lugari has lagged behind in development due to poor leadership. &ldquo;Lugari people have advised me to vie for the seat because they have suffered a lot since Independence, with no single tarmacked road, poor infrastructure and high poverty levels. This needs to be changed,&rsquo;&rsquo; Wabwire said. Other aspirants include Kakamega county chief of staff Nabii Nabwire, Laikipia University lecturer Job Kinzi, Nairobi businessman John Sande and Autem Investments executive director Liloma Wycliffe. Wabwire accused Savula of bias in disbursing CDF cash.
