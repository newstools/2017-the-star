Daimler&rsquo;s Mercedes-Benz has taken BMW&rsquo;s crown as the world&rsquo;s biggest luxury-car brand, ending its reign after more than a decade. Mercedes&rsquo; worldwide deliveries rose 11.3% to 2.23 million cars, while BMW&rsquo;s rose 5.2% to 2.04 million cars. Mercedes had trailed the BMW marque since 2005 and in 2014 dropped below Audi to third place before a revamped SUV lineup drove a strong comeback last year, when sales of models including the GLA and GLC surged 34%. Mercedes are hoping its new E-class sedan will provide extra sales momentum this year.&nbsp;&nbsp;
