Kenya Pipeline volleyball Club players have asked their sponsor to give them permanent job status at the company.Currently, only two players&mdash;celebrated setter and Olympian Janet Wanja and outside hitter Monica Biama&mdash;are employed by the Kenya Pipeline Company.Team captain Trizah Atuka implored the management of the company to consider absorbing players into permanent employment.&ldquo;We will highly appreciate if players can be taken in on permanent salaried basis. We can see several former players working as staff with the company but for the current crop, if one retires now, they will not have a fallback plan,&rdquo; noted Atuka, the 2016 Most Valuable Player.Some of the players have been with the club for as many as six years and have been surviving on renewed contracts. On the flip side, KPC&rsquo;s corporate communication manager, Jason Nyantino, didn&rsquo;t make any indications to adjust the girls&rsquo; terms of engagement but asked them to consider going for college training.Meanwhile, five national under-23 national team players have come of age to join the senior ranks of the 2016 volleyball champions Kenya Pipeline.The five players, who joined the team last year and have been playing in Pipeline&rsquo;s &lsquo;B&rsquo; team, will be granted places in the senior lineup after they affirmed they are worth their salt and can deliver good results.There will be one change in each of the department in the team, as the said players who are headed for the FIVB World Under-23 women Championships in Slovenia in August, all play in different positions. They include the 2016 Africa Under-23 best setter Veronica Tanui, middle blocker Sinaida Yvonne, opposite hitter Beldine Akinyi, outside attacker and 2015 KSSSA most valuable player Edna Mwombe and Malava Girls&rsquo; alumni libero Celestine Nyongesa.Kenya Pipeline head coach Japheth Munala said that with the admittance of the five into the senior team, some players will fall back to the Kenya Pipeline B side.During team luncheon in Nairobi, Munala also announced that the Africa best blocker Ruth Jepng&rsquo;etich, who has been away for 13 months on medical certificate will return to action sometime in the 2017 season.&ldquo;Ruth is fit and back in training for the new season and I am sure that she will regain her fitness and form. She, however, will not return as the team captain as her successor, Atuka, is equally a good team leader and we are confident in her leadership,&rdquo; said Munala.Atuka intimated that Jepng&rsquo;etich&rsquo;s return is a morale booster to the team and their performance can only get better.The second most successful team in Africa, Kenya Pipeline, is now focused on reclaiming the continental crown and retaining the national title for the fourth time in a row. Kenya Pipeline finished third at the 2016 edition of the CAVB club extravaganza in Tunis, Tunisia. The club which last won the African title in 2005 are looking for their eighth continental trophy in April in Tunisia.
