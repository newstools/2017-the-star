Narok Governor aspirant Joseph Tiampati and Senate seat hopeful Ledama ole Kina have told Deputy President William Ruto to keep off the county politics.Tiampati and Kina, who will vie on the ODM ticket, accused the Deputy President of interfering with county affairs and disrespecting the leaders and the residents.Addressing the media on Monday, the duo said Governor Samuel Tunai, who is backed by the DP, has failed to deliver. They spoke after an ODM delegates meeting in Trans Mara West subcounty at Lenamo Springs Hotel.&ldquo;The people of Narok are not happy with the DP Ruto and Governor Tunai for giving them false promises. This was evidently clear when they held several meetings across the county last Thursday,&rsquo;&rsquo; Tiampati said. Kina urged residents to join other Kenyans in voting out the Jubilee government because it has failed, citing the ongoing strikes by doctors and lecturers. He said the government has in both crises failed to provide leadership just as it has done in communal clashes in the county. Tiampati and Kina also urged the residents to register as voters in large numbers and verify their details so that they can elect leaders of their choice.
