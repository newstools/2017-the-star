A Bungoma governor aspirant has dismissed a survey by the University of Nairobi&rsquo;s Economics Department on the popularity of candidates in the county.Former Kanduyi MP and governor aspirant Alfred Khang&rsquo;ati said the survey did not reflect the truth on the ground. &ldquo;The process was not genuine and has no truth at all. There is no way you can rate a person who has not declared interest in the race and tell us that he defeats those who have spent their resources and time on the ground. This is a big joke,&rdquo; he said on Saturday in Bungoma.Khang&rsquo;ati said the survey indicates Governor Kenneth Lusaka has an approval rating of 53 per cent, Jack Tumwa got 18 per cent, Wycliffe Wangamati four percent, while he got 14 per cent.&ldquo;This is ridiculous. Wangamati deserved a higher percentage than Tumwa, who has not declared his candidature. The figures were cooked to excite some people,&rdquo; he said.Khang&rsquo;ati said, &ldquo;No survey was done or people interviewed in Bungoma&rdquo;.&ldquo;Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli just cooked up figures to promote and maintain relevance in the Luhya community,&rdquo; the former MP said.Khang&rsquo;ati said the survey might have been funded by Western-based governors, because they were all ranked highly and declared winners by the survey carried out.He said a group of people cannot decide the fate of the Luhya community with the installation of ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi as their spokesperson, saying the position is of &ldquo;no consequence&rdquo;.&ldquo;Opposition leader Raila Odinga and Deputy President William Ruto fought for recognition in their communities. They were not handpicked. The story of installing Mudavadi as the Luhya spokesperson does not make sense,&rdquo; Khang&rsquo;ati said.He said Mudavadi has done nothing in Luhya land to deserve such a position. &ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t sacrificed for his people the way his father Moses Mudamba, Bukusu leader Moses Masinde and Koitalel arap Samoei fought for the country,&rdquo; Khang&rsquo;ati said.
