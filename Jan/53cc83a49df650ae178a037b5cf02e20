ODM ticket aspirants countrywide will be scrutinising the nomination on Saturday for the Central Kanyamkago ward by-election in March.They will be looking for reassurance that the selection process is free and fair. There are concerns that nominations for the general election in August may not be transparent and reflect the people&rsquo;s will.The March 22 by-election is shaping up to be a supremacy battle between Migori Governor Okoth Obado and hopeful Mark Nyamita in their quest to control Uriri constituency.Five candidates are seeking the ODM ticket on Saturday but they have only paid nomination fees for the general election.The seat fell vacant following the death of MCA Michael Osongo on September 26. Osongo, who was from Karateng&rsquo; sub-clan, was elected unopposed after defeating Alex Akugo in the 2013 primaries.Akugo is among the five aspirants for the seat and is related to Dominic Akugo, the director of Administration in Obado&rsquo;s office. He is also from Karateng&rsquo; sub-clan.Nyamita&rsquo;s elder brother Ken, a businessman, declared his interest in the seat during Osongo&rsquo;s burial. Mourners demanded that he speak, after he was denied a chance by the master of ceremonies, an Obado supporter.Dominic and Mark Nyamita have openly campaigned for and supported their relatives in a looming showdown in the race for Migori governor.Former councillor Godfrey Odera will be back in the race. He did not run in 2013.Other MCA hopefuls are Paul Ambayo, an NGO professional, and Dan Oyugi, an official of the Kenya Bankers&rsquo; Union. He worked at KCB.Odera said aspirants should directly sell their policies to voters, saying that Dominic and Nyamita are not on the ballot and won&rsquo;t decide the outcome.
