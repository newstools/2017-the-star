Budalangi MP Ababu Namwamba, who quit ODM to chart his own political path, has said he was "extremely hurt" by claims he was a Jubilee mole.Ababu told Citizen TV on Tuesday that he asked party leader Raila Odinga for the way forward after the allegations were made."There was this wave of propaganda woven against me. It was the first time I had heard the term mole... that i am a mole...I cannot be trusted. I was very hurt... extremely... I was very disturbed," he said.He said he sought audience with Raila, one of his primary concern being that the claims "were coming too close to the centre of power"."I was hearing voices from Oburu Oginga {Raila's brother}, Eliud Owalo {Raila's campaign manager} and so I asked Raila: 'is this reflective of your position'?" he said during an interview.The MP said he asked the ODM leader if he had any problems with him on running for the secretary general position but was assured that there was none.Read:What happened to Ababu Namwamba?Ababu, who is Labour Party of Kenya leader, denied allegations he was a Jubilee mole saying last year that this conclusion could not be drawn simply because he sat with leaders of the ruling coalition to discuss development.Recounting what happened before they went to Kasarani for elections for the SG post, Ababu said they received intelligence about 'Men in Black' who were going to disrupt the event."We received the reports and they were very reliable... that elections were going to be disrupted.The source of our Intel was very clear," he said."We had a very candid meeting with Raila and we laid our Intelligence and told him plans were at a very advanced stage."Ababu said they also told their leader of a meeting they held at 3D restaurant along Ngong' Road in Nairobi.He said they reported that boys had been hired to cause the disruption and that the intelligence included a claim that Raila would meet them.The MP said Raila disputed the claims and assured him that the election would continue as planned.In 2014 Raila told Jambo Boston radio station, an online radio station based in Lowell, Massachusetts that he knew the 'Men in Black'.He confirmed that the men who disrupted the elections were hired by ODM to provide security and had been used before.The 10 men dressed in black suits smashed ballot boxes and scattered voting papers during the February 28 party elections at Kasarani stadium.More on this: 'Men in black' are ODM party security, Raila now admitsAbabu said Raila should have told him the truth, as this would not have ruined their relationship, as that "how much I trust him".He said Raila failed the test of a mentor and a role model within Orange Democratic party."Raila was not honest with me. I believe he was not candid with me in terms of what he desired. It was evident that Raila preferred Agnes Zani to Ababu as secretary general," he said.Read: Lobby defends Ababu over claims he is Jubilee moleAlso read:[VIDEO] Luhya ODM MPs defend Namwamba over 'mole' claimsAbabu said his problems did not end there as another "wave of propaganda" was born after he won the post."It was that 'the sponsor of ODM fresh is Deputy President William Ruto and so Ababu wants to take the party and sell it to Ruto'," he said."I don't know what William Ruto was supposed to do after buying ODM. That's the story of another day."But he said he and Ruto were just friends, who forged the relationship when they started serving in ODM."He has been my friend after we split up. He was my friend when he became DP. Today he is the deputy leader of Jubilee and I am the party leader of Labour and we are still friends," he said.He added that he owes nobody an apology and no explanation for who his friends are.Read also:Ababu Namwamba breaks long silence, speaks of 'very frustrating' ODM post
