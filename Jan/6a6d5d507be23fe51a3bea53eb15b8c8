Struggling Airtel Kenya announced on Friday it expects to start countrywide rollout of high-speed 4G internet network in April, largely based on the success of tests in 20 sites in Nairobi from next week. The pilot in Nairobi will be followed by installation in Mombasa and Kisumu growing the sites covered to 65, the second-largest mobile network provider said. The countrywide rollout targets to increase its network sites by 29.07 per cent to 1,563 from 1,211 two years ago, the company said. Airtel will be the second mobile service provider to unveil the 4G network after telecommunications giant Safaricom. Airtel&rsquo;s market share rose 0.9 percentage points in the quarter ended last September to 17.5 per cent. &ldquo;We attribute the gains to the company&rsquo;s continued investment in network expansion, the introduction of innovative and value for money services,&rdquo; CEO Adil El Youssefi (pictured) said.
