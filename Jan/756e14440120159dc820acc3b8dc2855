Australian mining company Base Titanium has projected lower mineral production this year despite a high throughput at Kwale mines.The miner, whose volume of ore rose by 29.2 per cent to a record 3.05 million tonnes in December 2016, compared to 2.33 million tonnes in September, expects lower recoveries this year due to low mineral concentration at the site.&ldquo;As you increase throughput, your recoveries naturally drop because you have more material. But when you get to the recovery side, you actually end up dropping a little bit,&rdquo; external affairs manager Simon Wall said yesterday during Base Titanium&rsquo;s operational update for quarter four 2016 in Nairobi.The company has revised its 2017 production targets for rutile, zircon and ilmenite. Production of rutile is now expected to be between 88,000 and 93,000 tonnes, from a previous projection of between 88,000 and 95,000 tonnes, a 2,000-tonne drop.Zircon production is expected to go down to between 33,000 and 37,000 tonnes, from a previous projection of between 35,000 and 40,000 tonnes.However, the production of ilmenite remains unchanged at between 450,000 and 480,000 tonnes.The company hopes to reap big from ilmenite because of stable global prices, projected to increase further this year after a slump in mid 2016.This was as a result of heightened political activities in India which disrupted ilmenite exports from Tamil Nadu, and suppressed ilmenite production in China &ldquo;due to increased environmental inspections&rdquo;, Base Titanium said.&ldquo;These events together with the ongoing strength in pigment demand is expected to result in further improvements in ilmenite prices through 2017,&rdquo; the firm said in its financial report released yesterday.Managing director Tim Carstens said a tonne of ilmenite is expected to trade at an average of between $140 (Sh14,563 ) and $200 (Sh20,805 ) per tonne, rutile at an average of $750 (Sh78,018 ) per tonne, while zircon prices are expected to increase from $740 (Sh76,978 ) per tonne to $800 (Sh83,220 ).Prices for Base resources have increased by more than 100 per cent between May and December 2016. The company continues to secure forward sales and has now contracted all ilmenite production through to late February 2017, and has secured further price increases for these forward sales,&rdquo; Carstens said. Base Titanium produced 468,903 tonnes of ilmenite in 2016.
