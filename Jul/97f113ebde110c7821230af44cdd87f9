Suspended IT director James Muhati has quietly returned to the IEBC under a cloud of suspicion that has split bosses with slightly over a month to the General Election.The Star has established that some IEBC commissioners were opposed to the reinstatement of Muhati, who was kicked out following accusations he had refused to cooperate in the audit of ICT systems.NASA has opposed the return of Muhati, a former head of information systems at Kenya Airways, over claims he is partisan.In a statement to newsrooms, Raila&rsquo;s advisor, Salim Lone, said Muhati should remain under suspension.&ldquo;While Mr Muhati&rsquo;s suspension was publicly announced by the chairman, his reinstatement has been done in an opaque way, with Kenyans in the dark as to whether he was properly investigated as the commission had promised to do... If he is cleared, the commission should state clearly by who?&rdquo; Lone said.Yesterday, IEBC communication manager Andrew Limo confirmed Muhati had resumed work, but said the commission is yet to discuss the investigation report.He said he is not aware of any split in the commission over the decision to reinstate Muhati.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he would have been brought back if it was not a unanimous commission decision. At the end of the day, it must have been minuted and it must have been agreed that he comes back. In all decisions people may have different views, but in a democracy, it&rsquo;s said the majority will have their way. It happens in every boardroom,&rdquo; Limo said.It has also emerged IEBC procurement director Lawy Aura, who was sent on compulsory leave, will not return to the Commission after all.Aura was seconded to the IEBC from Treasury, where he is said to have returned after the IEBC purge.Limo said the commission has no powers to sack an individual they did not employ.&ldquo;He [Aura] was seconded from Treasury so he went back to Treasury. That is why we used the word relieved of his duties.We cannot sack somebody we did not employ,&rdquo; he said.The reinstatement of the IEBC boss comes at a time when NASA is pushing the IEBC to put its house in order to avoid technology failure like it happened in 2013.In a terse letter to IEBC Chairman Wafula Chebukati recently, NASA asked the commission to explain the precautions it has put in place to protect the results transmission system.
