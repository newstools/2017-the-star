Funyula MP Paul Otuoma has dismissed reports that Senator Amos Wako has defected from his camp to back Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong.Otuoma is running against Ojaamong as independent candidate."The reports that Wako is now vouching for the six-piece voting pattern for ODM is part of the propaganda by Ojaamong after sensing defeat and it will not work," Otuoma said yesterday. Wako was handed a direct ticket by ODM to defend his seat.Otuoma chose to run as an independent after shambolic ODM primaries in which Ojaamong was declared winner. &ldquo;I have talked to Wako and he is solidly in my camp, because he knows what the people of Busia wants in leadership,&rdquo; he said.Wako had previously declared he would not support Ojaamong, but concentrate on his reelection.&ldquo;We want NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga not to lose even one vote. If we start quarreling within NASA, Raila will lose the presidency,&rdquo; he was reported to have said.Political pundits opine the Busia race could be determined by the tribal matrix as it would most likely pit Luhyas against Tesos.But Otuoma yesterday said the tribal talk was misplaced as residents of Busia, including Tesos were simply angered by the dismal performance by Ojaamong.&ldquo;He should stop hiding in the tribal formations and tell the people what he did for them for the last four years in office as governor,&rdquo; he said..
