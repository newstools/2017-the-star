NASA&rsquo;s failure to agree on a single candidate for Embakasi South MP will likely mean a split vote and victory for Jubilee on August 8.Twelve candidates are on the race. Incumbent Irshad Sumra is running for reelection on the ODM ticket. Wiper has fielded Musili Mawathe.Former Nairobi Environment executive Evans Ondieki is the Ford Kenya candidate.The split votes are likely to give Mutunga Mutungi of Jubilee an easy win.Yesterday, Nairobi ODM chairman George Aladwa said Sumra refused to step down for Mawathe.&ldquo;He [Sumra] said he beat Mawathe [in the 2013 general election],&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;But there is a Kamba vote bloc in the constituency that will elect Mawathe overwhelmingly. Kambas can&rsquo;t vote for a Jubilee candidate [Mutungi] when Wiper has its own.&rdquo;Just needs 2,500 votesBut Nairobi Jubilee chairman Sanctus Ndengwa said he is confident Mutungi will carry the day.He said all political parties are facing a challenge of getting all their supporters in the same camp. Ndengwa said, however, Mutungi has more than 60 per cent of Jubilee support, and the split in NASA will obviously work in his favour.&ldquo;Being a Kamba, he is likely to get at least 2,500 of the community&rsquo;s votes, which is all he needs to triumph over the NASA candidates,&rdquo; he said.Kambas are the dominant voters in the constituency. Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka on Sunday urged the community to support Mawathe. He held a rally at Mukuru kwa Reuben. There are 150,315 registered voters in the constituency. Other candidates include Kibagendi Otachi of Kanu, Jared Onyari of MDP, Michael Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a of MCC, Kennedy Koto of KSC, as well as independents David Njuguna, David Obanyi, Dennis Orengo and Peter Ongeta.
