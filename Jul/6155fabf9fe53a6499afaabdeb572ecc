A Kenya Forest Service officer and his friends were hospitalised with food poisoning in Embu on Saturday. They were rushed to St Michael Nursing Home in Runyenjes in critical condition after a meal of ugali and vegetables. Joseph Njagi, one of the victims, said he and his two friends were visiting the KFS officer where the meal was prepared for them. He said after finishing, they started vomiting, experiencing fever and weakness in their body. Vanessa Kina said tests at the hospital revealed the food was toxic. She said she started experiencing symptoms much later and collapsed at the hospital waiting bay. Dar Stephen Maina said the patients are recovering and will be discharged after three days. He dispelled rumours that the four were suffering from cholera, adding that samples ascertained that it was food poisoning.
