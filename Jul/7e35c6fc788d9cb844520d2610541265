NASA yesterday demanded that the IEBC publish the voter register as required by law for parties to scrutinise and plan ahead of the August polls.&ldquo;Kenyans have 34 days to the August 8 General Election and up to now, the IEBC has failed, or totally avoided, to make public the voter register to be used on Election Day,&rdquo; ODM secretary general Agnes Zani said in a press statement.Section 33( 1 ) of the Elections Act, 2016 requires the IEBC to make the voter register available at its registration centres, ward and constituency offices.Zani said the IEBC is buying time to publish a PDF version of the register with names of all voters in polling stations so Kenyans fail to audit and remove ghost voters, something she said will work in favour of Jubilee.&ldquo;This needs to be done in good time to allow members to verify and plan,&rdquo; she said.Zani accused the IEBC of sidelining NASA.&ldquo;There are reports of IEBC clerks doing mass transfers of voters to other polling stations in favour of certain candidates,&rdquo; she said, adding the verification through the 70000 code brought out a list that did not clearly link persons to their identifiers.Zani said, &ldquo;Our voters want to know their polling stations. They want to make a final verification because this election is momentous in their lives.&rdquo; She continued, &ldquo;They also want to know who else is voting in these polling centres to avoid cases of voter importation on Election Day. Voters want to plan in advance.&rdquo; Zani urged the IEBC to publish the voter register per polling station.She said merely giving the summation of total voters per ward or per constituency, or per county, is not enough. &ldquo;Moreover, such summations, as in the case of Tana River and Embu, have been glaringly faulty with figures exaggerated upwards,&rdquo; Zani said.
