&ldquo;The first thing we do, let&rsquo;s kill all the lawyers.&rdquo; That is one of the most remarkable and controversial quotes from Shakespeare&rsquo;s book Henry VI.The quote is commonly referred to as the &lsquo;lawyers&rsquo; joke&rsquo;, and was a suggestion to improve and correct the social evil that had filled the country.It may seem an irony to many, but a world without lawyers independent from government would not be a happier place.The legal fraternity largely disagrees with Shakespeare&rsquo;s writing and feels if the guardians of independent thinking (lawyers) were not safeguarded, then the rule of law losses its meaning.For example, in July last year, a cloud of grief covered the legal fraternity when two bodies, one suspected to be that of lawyer Willie Kimani and a taxi driver were retrieved from the Oldonyo Sabuk river in Kilimambogo. Kimani went missing a week before after attending a court session at the Mavoko law court in Machakos county.Before their abduction, the lawyer was representing his client, Josphat Mwendwa, who had filed a complaint saying he had been wrongfully shot by police. The Law Society of Kenya said Willie Kimani&rsquo;s death was a &ldquo;dark day for the rule of law in Kenya&rdquo;.Several months before this, in 2015, Burundi was hit by unrest after the ruling party in Burundi, the CNDD-FDD, announced that incumbent President Pierre Nkurunziza would run for a third term in the 2015 presidential election.The announcement sparked widespread demonstrations in the capital, Bujumbura, by those opposed to Nkurunziza, among them the legal fraternity, after the country&rsquo;s highest court approved Nkurunziza&rsquo;s right to run for a third term in office.During the period, one of the judges&rsquo; fled the country, alleging he had received death threats from senior members of the government.The unrest has since seen the law society in Burundi banned and some of its members jailed without trial.Elsewhere, the English-speaking regions of Cameroon was gripped by crisis in January after thousands of lawyers, teachers and students and several civil society groups took to the streets, citing discrimination against Anglophones by the central government and by President Paul Biya.The country is split between Anglophone and Francophone-speaking regions, with the Francophone dominating.The crisis has seen the harsh rule of President Biya arrest and jail the protestors, among them the legal fraternity.Anglophone lawyers arrested in the protest have also been put on trial under military court with charges that could lead to the death penalty.These are some of the key incidents in the continent targeting the legal fraternity that have left lawyers feeling endangered and their independence jeopardised.Such concerns, they say, have not been part of the conversation for some years. They have raised urgency on the unity of the continent&rsquo;s legal fraternity, leading to the revival of the once-vibrant African Bar Association.The association collapsed in the early 90&rsquo;s following the military state of Nigeria.LIBERATION STRUGGLEEstablished in 1971, AfBA was formed to protect the fearless voice of the legal fraternity.The organisation comprised of members from Anglophone countries and fought for democracy in a time most African leaders ruled with an iron fist.Among the early members of AfBA was former Law Society of Kenya chairman Lee Muthoga, between 1981 and 1982.Muthoga recalls most states in those days had a single party. Moreover, the presidency had excessive power, as detention and death sentence awaited those who opposed the rule of those in power.&ldquo;In those days, being a lawyer in Africa was the hardest thing. We were seen as the enemies of the government of the day. In our quest for justice, we were detained and jailed without trial,&rdquo; Muthoga said.It is at this time that the struggle for liberation grew fiercer, and in Kenya, it led to the rise of multiparty democracy, Saba Saba, and other protests seeking justice.The struggle was led by the then young lawyers, which later made them the most prominent and fearless lawyers in the country today, including James Orengo, Paul Muite and Gitobu Imanyara.But this was not only in Kenya but also in the entire Africa, where most heads of state unleashed their might on those who opposed their rule.&ldquo;In 1971, we met in Nigeria and thought if all lawyers were united and had a common voice, then it would be easy to push our agenda, to ensure we could bring democracy to Africa,&rdquo; Muthoga said.Before its collapse, the association managed to move masses across Africa, championing for release of political detainees, end of capital punishment, adoption of democratic governance and protection and independence of the legal fraternity.&ldquo;We need to come together and revive what we started. We had seen its benefits in the 80&rsquo;s and 70&rsquo;s as the wave of the unity of the legal fraternity shook those who defied democracy and independence in the continent,&rdquo; Muthoga said.AfBA president Hannibal Uwaifo told the Star the legal fraternity was accorded independence in most African states between 1970 and 1990.Uwaifo said the association is being restored to fight for good governance, uphold human rights and strengthen law societies in Africa.&ldquo;An independent legal profession is a vital ingredient for a country to thrive politically, socially and economically. The current establishment in some countries seeks to attack the independence of the legal profession, and undermining it is a dangerous path to go down,&rdquo; Uwaifo said.He said governments needed to recognise the importance of supporting an independent legal profession and access to justice.&ldquo;Not only will this benefit their own country&rsquo;s economic development, it is also a requirement of the sustainable development goals, which call for the promotion of the rule of law and access to justice for all,&rdquo; Uwaifo said.&ldquo;Most legal societies in Africa are in danger. They are facing threats because of their fearless voice and we hope to address this,&rdquo; Uwaifo said.Since its revival in 2014, AfBA has drawn a membership of 26 countries. Kenya is the latest entrant and the second in East Africa to join the association after Uganda.The headquarters are in Abuja, Nigeria.Kenya currently has the second-highest number of practising lawyers in Africa, 16,000, behind Nigeria with its 248,000 lawyers.AFBA INTERVENTIONSAfBA has intervened in a number of cases targeting lawyers, Uwaifo says.In December last year, AfBA intervened after a constitutional crisis arose in The Gambia after former President Yahya Jammeh resisted handing over power after the presidential elections declared Adama Barrow the winner. A delegation from the African Bar Association in Lagos, Nigeria, was sent to The Gambia to meet with Jammeh and President Adama Barrow, the civil society organisations, Gambia Bar Association and discuss with them to find a solution to the political crisis in the country. The meeting gave recommendations that saw Jammeh hand over power to Adama Barrow.In Cameroon, where lawyers are facing trial for protesting against the discrimination of Anglophone-speaking lawyers, AfBA has hired the former lawyer representing Kenyan Deputy President William Ruto, Karim Khan, among the lawyers to represent them.&ldquo;AfBA has also written to the Kenyan government, demanding justice for the murder of Willie Kimani, and we hope this will be done and justice served to protect the legal fraternity,&rdquo; Uwaifo says.The bar will also enable lawyers to establish networks and contacts throughout the continent.AfBA has described the continent as the next stop of legal enterprise, as it contains huge opportunities, hence the need to make a good united association that will enable local lawyers to benefit from the opportunities in legal practice.It also targets international opportunities, mainly in the International Court of Justice, where most cases presented are from the continent. Ironically, lawyers from Africa do not represent the cases and are left to their European counterparts.The association will also train lawyers on new law fields to explore, such as maritime law, petroleum law, among others.With this, the association says, the continent will be the centre of democracy. Legal independence will be upheld and Africa will be able to achieve its Sustainable Development Goals, enabling it to compete with other developed continents.
