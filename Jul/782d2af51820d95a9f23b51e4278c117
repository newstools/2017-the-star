Independent governor candidate Peter Kenneth (pictured) has said political parties do not have the power to determine who is elected.He said independents have an equal chance and can break the barriers of political party alignment to win elective seats.&ldquo;We need to choose people based on their qualities, not political parties as many people perceive,&rdquo; Kenneth said.Speaking to the Star yesterday, he dismissed opinion polls that had placed him a far third after his rivals incumbent Evans Kidero and Senator Mike Sonko. Kenneth said the power of choice is with the people.He said Nairobi residents would have a miserable five years if either Kidero or Sonko win.Kenneth said incumbent Governor Evans Kidero and Senator mike Sonko had both failed in their roles.He said Kidero would drag Nairobi to its knees. Kenneth said Sonko has failed in his oversight role as a senator.He said, &ldquo;All we need in Nairobi is a manager who can address the immediate problems facing the people of Nairobi and generate revenue at the same time.&rdquo;Kenneth said he will deal with the traffic menace within 90 days of assuming office if elected.Among other issues he promises to deal with include the garbage menace, which he said he could sort out in six weeks.Kenneth said he will ensure proper use of funds and decentralise operations. &ldquo;We want to make Nairobi more friendly,&rdquo; he said.
