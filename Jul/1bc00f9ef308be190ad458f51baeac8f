A 14-year-old pupil was arrested in Kitale town on Monday for allegedly killing a schoolmate by hitting him on the head with a blunt object. Attacker Sammy Sikinga and victim Musa Achi studied at Kimeloi Primary & Secondary School in Kesogon. Trans Nzoia West OCPD Jackson Mwenga said Sikinga was a class eight pupil and Achi a form two student. The pupil is said to have struck Achi, 15, on the head following a quarrel, causing him to lose consciousness. “We rushed him to hospital but he succumbed to severe head injuries,” Mwenga said. “We traced the suspect who had escaped to another village and arrested him. He is helping us with investigations." Achi's father, 47-year-old James Ekoro, said Mwenga and Achi fought before the attack. “It seems my son hit him so hard that he retaliated using a club," said Ekoro.
