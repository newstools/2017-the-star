Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka has said the party will instruct its lawyers to make sure Machakos governor aspirant Wavinya Ndeti is fully compensated for her time wasted when she was taken to court &ldquo;on frivolous grounds&rdquo;.Speaking on Tuesday in Mwingi, he said, &ldquo;There are people who have made a habit of suing Wavinya, but enough is enough. She should be given peace and time to campaign.&rdquo;Kalonzo said incumbent Governor Alfred Mutua is in for a big shock because &ldquo;Wavinya will win dramatically&rdquo;. He said, &ldquo;Mutua used me to climb to the top and after achieving what he wanted, he threw the ladder away. I am tired of being used by Kamba politicians to build themselves then they forget about me. That is why I told the President that I gave him those who defected from Wiper.&rdquo;
