Public Service CS Sicily Kariuki has dismissed as lies claims that CSs are engaging in politics. She said the allegations have been made out of ignorance because politics and development cannot be separated.&ldquo;Politics and development are intertwined. It&rsquo;s unheard of to bar CSs from visiting parts of the country to assess service demands, inspect projects sponsored by the respective ministries, and exercise their civic duties to enlighten the people on the government&rsquo;s agenda,&rdquo; Kariuki said. &ldquo;We must fervently search for solutions to the problems bedeviling women and youth of this country and while doing so, invoke the privileges bestowed upon them by the Constitution of service to Kenyans, regardless of their political affiliation.&rdquo; She spoke during the launch of the NYS Youth Empowerment Programme in three constituencies ofTana River county on Saturday.
