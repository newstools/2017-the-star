Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho has said he will donate his billboard sites to rivals, who have accused him of using underhand tactics to edge them out. He has booked 21 advertising sites through agents. Mombasa has 138 sites. Joho&rsquo;s running mate William Kingi yesterday said billboards don&rsquo;t vote. &ldquo;Voters&rsquo; decisions are not pegged on the number of billboards one has,&rdquo; he said. Kingi said Joho has the support of residents because of his track record and need not depend on visibility to be reelected. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t be held responsible for someone who did not prepare in advance,&rdquo; he said. Joho has been accused by Senator Hassan Omar (Wiper), Nyali MP Hezron Awiti and JP&rsquo;s Suleiman Shahbal of threatening to revoke licences of advertising firms if they mount their billboards. He has denied the allegations and said he booked his sites in advance. Shahbal said he tried booking from January but was unable to secure space.
