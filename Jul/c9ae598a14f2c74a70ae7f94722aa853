The KAA employee sacked over Education CS Fred Matiang'i's airport saga should be reinstated, Makueni senator Mutula Kilonzo Jr has said. Daisy Cherogony reportedly refused to allow Matiang'i and his security team into the JKIA without going through the screening procedures. She sued the authority for suspending her for an alleged altercation with the Cabinet Secretary in April. The CS dismissed the claims saying he has never gone through any airport without security clearance. More on this: I've nothing to do with KAA employee sacking, says CS Matiang'i Mutula said: "Cherogony should be reinstated unconditionally. Matiang'i should not let this young woman remain jobless on his account." But others, including KFCB CEO Ezekiel Mutua, claimed the matter was being blown out of proportion. "I read a lot of malice in this airport story," Mutua said via Twitter, adding Matiang'i is being used to industrial case between the woman and the Kenya Airports Authority. "The matter is in court. It's a labour issue and the material facts can be canvassed there with the employer. Matiang'i has nothing to do with it," he said. Noting the woman had three other cases, the Kenya Film Classification Board boss further said Matiangi 's name is being used to solicit sympathy for the woman. "[It is also being used to] draw dissatisfaction on a top performing officer. Legally speaking, Matiang'i is not party to the suit. He can't even appear in court as an interested person,." Social media user Eric Mwiti‏ said it was wrong for someone to use Matingi'is name to get the woman sacked. "Matiang'i is a committed Adventist. I'm sure you will solve this after Sabbath and that justice will prevail," lawyer Apollo Mboya said. Lenny Kibet‏ expressed confidence in the CS, saying he is incapable of the allegations raised against him. Lawyer Donald Kipkorir‏ noted: "[It is sad that] some are falsely accusing Cherogony of other disciplinary cases. Her termination letter says it was because she humiliated Matiang'i." Cherogony sued Matiangi' for wrongful dismissal and wants KAA to pay her Sh2.4 million in compensation following the sack. She argued that according to the airport's security manual, CSs did not qualify for any preferential treatment unless they had special passes. The woman said Matiang'i and his entourage did not have the special passes. In a tweet on Friday, the minister termed himself a victim of his office. "I am shocked about the callous fabrications around it." In Cherongony's suspension letter dated April 7, KAA says the official embarrassed the CS who was to catch a 6am flight to Kisumu.
