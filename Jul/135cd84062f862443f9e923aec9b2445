Water CS Eugene Wamalwa has been told to respect NASA co-principal Musalia Mudavadi and to &ldquo;stop being used by Jubilee to attack him.&rdquo;ANC secretary general George Otsotsi claimed the incessant attacks by Wamalwa on Mudavadi are &ldquo;unfortunate, careless and designed to precipitate a war of words&rdquo;. He said Wamalwa is not Mudavadi&rsquo;s political equal and should concentrate on being CS, &ldquo;leaving politics to politicians&rdquo;. &ldquo;DP William Ruto and President Uhuru Kenyatta should not hide behind Eugene, but be men enough to face Mudavadi,&rdquo; Otsosi said.He told Wamalwa to explain to Luhyas his &ldquo;embarrassing and failed political debut in Nairobi politics&rdquo;. Otsosi challenged Eugene to explain his &ldquo;unwise&rdquo; decision to collapse New Ford Kenya into JP at the expense of its members.
