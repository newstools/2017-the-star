Trans Nzoia’s maize harvest is expected to drop by a massive 500,000 bags because of the armyworm attacks.
Kennedy Kagai, the county Agriculture director, said they are expecting 4.9 million bags out of the anticipated 5.4 million bags this season.
He spoke on Wednesday during the first national youth conference in agribusiness in Nairobi, which was attended by more than 500 youths from various counties.
“Last year, we harvested around 5.3 million bags, but this year our target was 5.4 million bags. There will be a reduction due to erratic rains and the fall armyworm infestation,” he said.
Kagai added that farmers will start the main harvest in September, but harvesting of green maize will start next month.
Agriculture CS Willy Bett recently said the country will have a 20 per cent harvest reduction due to the armyworms.
At least 25 counties and about 200,000ha have been infested by the fall armyworm, putting 650,000ha under threat. The Agriculture ministry says the armyworm has invaded Western, North and South Rift regions in Baringo, Bungoma, Busia, Kericho, Nakuru, Nandi, Narok, Siaya, Uasin Gishu and Kakamega counties. Kagai said the infestation in Trans Nzoia is going down as the county receives heavy rainfall that suppresses the pests.
“Infestation is not so much in Saboti and Cherangany subcounties, but we still have problems in Endebess and Kwanza subcounties because of low rainfall.
“We are still receiving erratic rains in the subcounties that border West Pokot county. We are still spraying the maize but if we receive more rain, the infestation could reduce,” Kagai said.
Hundreds of maize farmers in Nakuru county counted losses following an invasion of the fall armyworm that destroyed acres of crops.
In two months, the pest was especially destructive in Rongai, Njoro, Nakuru East and Subukia.
