With barely 35 days to the election, Jubilee bosses at the Coast have threatened to withdraw their support for the party, over claims they have been sidelined by the party&rsquo;s national office.On Saturday, the party&rsquo;s county heads from Coast&rsquo;s six counties said they have also been ignored by Jubilee candidates.Led by Mombasa county chairman Matano Chengo, they demanded a meeting with party leader President Uhuru Kenyatta within 72 hours to iron out the differences.The ultimatum lapsed on Tuesday at 1pm. The leaders had said if Uhuru or Deputy President William Ruto fails to meet them, they will convene a meeting where they will officially announce they have withdrawn their support.On Saturday, the Jubilee heads accused party candidates of blocking them from reaching Uhuru and Ruto whenever the two are in town.They said the candidates are only using Jubilee as vehicles to Parliament and do not have the party&rsquo;s interests at heart. &ldquo;People surrounding the President whenever he comes to the Coast are not selling the party or the President. They sell themselves as individuals,&rdquo; Kilifi county chairman John Mumba said.
