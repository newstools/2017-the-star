The National Gender and Equality Commission reports that about 1.2 million youth across the country have never set foot in school (see P2).In a Status of Equality and Inclusion in Kenya report launched yesterday, this figure is 11 per cent of youth aged between 18 to 34.Many of them are functionally illiterate. Not being in education, training or employment locks them in extreme poverty when they are in the prime of life. Eleven per cent of the nation&rsquo;s youth excluded from gainful employment and self-improvement is an unconscionable number. They form a pool that violent crime and extremism can draw from in dangerous times.Free primary education needs to be truly free. Requirements such as those for school uniforms should be reviewed. These young people should be free to turn up in class in their mitumba T-shirts or shukas.They should be aided where they demonstrate financial need and CDF cash should come to the rescue.Government and parents both need to do their part to reduce this terrible statistic.
