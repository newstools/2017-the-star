NASA has asked the government to explain why eight military personnel are trailing Opposition leader Raila Odinga.Siaya Senator James Orengo, who represents the Opposition in legal matters, said the eight are among 60 officers who underwent a two-month training in Katulo, Wajir."These officers are using police vehicles with non-GK number plates that keep changing. They were relocated to Kiambu on an unspecified mission," he told a media briefing in Nairobi on Tuesday.Orengo claimed the 60 AP officers were trained at Kahawa military barracks in Nairobi under the leadership of a retired lieutenant called Kimunya."Prior to the release of the eight officers, a number of trainees had from time to time shadowed and trailed Raila and other co principals in their daily political activities," he noted."We fear Jubilee is hatching a similar plan again with this suspicious training."Orengo said the man named Kimunya is deputised by an officer from the NIS whose name they have not yet established.The Senator further said the officers were ordered to operate as ordinary civilians while using equipment from the police force."...this makes their mission even more sinister. We are not going to wait to tell the tale after the crime is committed. We must raise the flag to protect our leaders," he said."We challenge [IG Joseph] Boinnet to account for officers under his charge. We are aware officers on this mission have been made to surrender their official status documents."Orengo said President Uhuru Kenyatta should assure the country that Raila and other NASA principals will be safe.The others are DP candidate Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper), Isaac Rutto (CCM), Moses Wetang'ula (Ford Kenya) and Musalia Mudavadi (ANC)."We are putting the President on notice that we will hold him responsible for security lapses and challenges that affect Raila."Early in June, the NASA presidential campaign secretariat dismissed claims that Raila had asked for additional security personnel.This was after claims the Opposition chief had requested more officers that would have made his security detail comprise 50 officers.More on this: Raila asked for 34 officers, not 50, NASA secretariat saysAlso read: Uhuru preparing military to rig the election, claims Raila
