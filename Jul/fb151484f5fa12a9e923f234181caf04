Former City Hall chief finance officer Jimmy Kiamba is appealing a decision that allowed the taxman to demand millions of shillings from his company in unpaid taxes.Kiamba is aggrieved by the decision of Justice George Odunga declining to quash Kenya Revenue Commission's (KRA) fresh demands that he pays Sh 16.9 million saying KRA's move is malicious.KRA and the former City Hall CFO have been fighting since 2015 when the agency obtained orders to freeze his bank accounts over suspicious transactions and alleged failure to pay tax.The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission then revealed in court that Kiamba had transacted over Sh400 million in nine months and wondered how a person who earns Sh85, 000 per month could do that.He moved to court to protest the demand but on June 26, Justice George Odunga dismissed the suit he had filed jointly with his wife Tracy Mbinya Musau and Jimbise Limited.&ldquo;I decline to entertain this application with the result that it is incompetent and is struck out with costs,&rdquo; Odunga ruled.Aggrieved by the decision, Kiamba now wants the Court of Appeal to reverse the orders insisting that KRA ought to have commenced recovery proceedings instead of a new assessment.He argues that KRA&rsquo;s claim was based on inter-bank transfers between him and Jimbise Limited, which the taxman erroneously treated as rental income.The taxman has in the court papers indicated that the Sh16.9 million claim is separate from the Sh480 million demand it made on Kiamba in 2015.Justice Odunga held that the former City Hall CFO should have first raised objections to the demand and appealed to the Tax Appeals Tribunal before moving to court.Kiamba has separately appealed the Sh480 million demand before the Tax Appeals Tribunal.
