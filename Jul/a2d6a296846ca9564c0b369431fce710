A Jubilee chief campaigner in Bungoma was shot dead on Thursday night and his children injured in what police say may have been a political attack. Edward Barasa, 50, was killed at his Kibingei home by a gang that attacked at about 10pm and stole nothing. Reports indicate Barasa had been warned about his association with the ruling coalition. He was a staunch supporter of Governor Kenneth Lusaka and the Jubilee coordinator for Kibingei ward Barasa's wife Zipporah Mulongo said the attackers were five in number and that they shot one of their children. "They held all of us hostage, ransacked each room and demanded to know the whereabouts of my husband who was hiding in one of the rooms." Mulongo said she refused to reveal where Barasa was, prompting the gang to turn on her daughters. The girls were taken to hospital after the incident. "I believe this was a case or revenge because of politics. My husband had complained of harassment by a local politician." The Governor and Water CS Eugene Wamalwa, who have been campaigning in the area, visited the home. Lusaka condemned the attack and called for speedy investigations. "I have been hit hard. This man was key to my re-election bid." Wamalwa said political intolerance in the county should be dealt with firmly as such incidents left several politicians dead during the last election. "Enough is is enough. Why should innocent people be maimed in the name of politics?" Bungoma county police commandant Charles Munyoli said they will leave no stone unturned. The county is a battle ground for Jubilee and NASA coalitions which both want to win majority seats and take control.
