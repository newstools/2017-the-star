The Controller of Budget and City Hall clashed yesterday over delay in disbursement of funds to pay 13,000 county workers.The workers have threatened to go on strike starting Monday.On Monday, county secretary Robert Ayisi notified the workers of the salary delays, citing failure by CoB Agnes Odhiambo to approve the funds and end of financial year stock taking.However, Odhiambo denied her office has delayed approval of county funds.&ldquo;We only approve funds upon a written request by the county. But we have not received any,&rdquo; Odhiambo told the Star on the phone yesterday.County employees have not been paid for June and have threatened to strike starting Monday, if they are not paid by tomorrow.&ldquo;The county government is exploring all avenues possible to pay the June salaries, latest on July 14. Your understanding on the same will be highly appreciated,&rdquo; reads Ayisi&rsquo;s notice to the workers.But in a strike notice on Tuesday, the workers, through the Kenya County Government Workers Union, rubbished Ayisi&rsquo;s grounds for the delay.&ldquo;We have noted the payment of salaries as enshrined in the Labour Practices and Laws has become a thorn in the flesh of the workers with flimsy and totally unacceptable reasons being given by yourself,&rdquo; reads the notice . It was signed by branch secretary Boniface Waweru and addressed to Ayisi.Speaking to the Star yesterday, Ayisi faulted the union for issuing ultimatums, saying the delay was caused by &ldquo;outside factors&rdquo;.&ldquo;This problem is not unique to Nairobi. It is the end of the financial year and all the budget plans have to be uploaded in the Ifmis. This takes time and that is what has caused the problem,&rdquo; he said.But Waweru said the county has a habit of delaying the workers&rsquo; salaries, adding that last last month, they were paid on the 15th.
