Let us not, as Jubilee, lose seats because of these brokers," said the chairman.The officials further said Jubilee candidates are blocking them from meeting the President and airing their views on Coast matters.&ldquo;Coast politics is unique. It is not like in Nairobi or Rift Valley. We know our people best and are better placed to give reports on what is actually on the ground,&rdquo; said Chengo.This comes two days after some Senators and National Assembly members from Nairobi and Rift Valley visited Mombasa and held a rally at Tononoka grounds.Chengo and other Coast leaders in the party did not attend the Thursday rally which was meant to officially launch campaigns for Mombasa Deputy Governor Hazel Katana&rsquo;s senator bid.&ldquo;We were not consulted as party leaders. We were only invited as participants and had already organised our own meeting in Likoni which we could not abandon,&rdquo; said the chairman.The leaders said most Jubilee candidates at the Coast are only after reaching Parliament and county assemblies using the ruling coalition as a vehicle.They do not have the party's interests at heart, they said.&ldquo;People surrounding the President whenever he comes to the Coast are not selling the party or the President when they go to campaign. They sell themselves as individuals,&rdquo; said Mumba.Warda and Ali Mwatsahu, the party&rsquo;s Mombasa secretary general, said they have been working hard to sell the party at the grassroots but their efforts are being frustrated by brokers and some Jubilee candidates.Coast Jubilee leaders earlier pledged to protect their votes on August 8 to prevent the "hooliganism" experienced during last year's Malindi by-elections.Led by point man Gideon Mung'aro, who is Kilifi North MP and governor aspirant, the leaders said they will not bow to intimidation by their rivals and will ensure the ruling coalition gets majority votes.More on this: [VIDEO] Jubilee will protect Coast votes, block hooliganism of Malindi by-poll - Mung'aro
