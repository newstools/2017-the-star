Mercy Myra’s ex husband, Attitude, who is also a famous Kenyan hip hop pioneer, will be bringing the lasses to the country. In an exclusive interview with Word is, he said he is the bridge between Kenya and Atlanta when it comes to entertainment. “Some Kenyan clubs contacted me in a bid to bring in dancers from Atlanta, better known as Cultural Atlanta Dancers. Having a new business venture as a tattoo parlour owner, I get to meet strippers and this made it easier for me to connect Kenya and Atlanta.” Based on how the elections pan out, the “cultural dancers” will jet in late August. Attitude defended bringing the dancers, saying “there is interest in the culture here, the American”. He also mentioned that the dancers will be coming in after the general election for three weeks with appearances at B-Club and X’s millionaire. He said bringing the dancers will bring a new side of entertainment to Kenya and connect Kenya and Atlanta. In the interview, he also mentioned coming back to reside in Kenya and work on collaborations. When asked about hip hop artistes beefing, he only but wished they would work together to grow the hip hop industry. At the end of the interview, he clarified that he is now officially divorced to the songbird Mercy Myra and they are in good terms. He also said they are working on their friendship as they co-parent their daughter.
