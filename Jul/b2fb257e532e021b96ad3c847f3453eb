It was least expected which is what made it so spectacular," she said.Jun had been waiting at sundown by the water hole for one of the large elephants to come and have a drink."Herds of zebra and giraffe drifted in and out to quench their thirst and on them arrived the Oxpeckers birds, who graze and feed predominantly on large mammals," she said. "The giraffe's unusual way of quenching their thirst allowed the flurry of pesky Oxpeckers to follow the trail of water left behind as it lifted his head after drinking."Feathered friends: The giraffe could be seen taking in a drink before sneezing, sending birds flying off in all directions/DAILY MAILThe unexpected encounter is one Jun is unlikely to forget."I've spent over a decade in Africa and witnessed many interactions between Oxpeckers and large mammals, but nothing comes close to what we witnessed that evening."
