Jubilee and NASA will converge at Uhuru Park in Nairobi on July 7 for prayers to mark this year's Saba Saba Day. The day commemorates protesters who successfully pressed for Kenya's multi-party democracy in 1990. Kenyans mark it with several activities including pushing the government to ease the cost of living. Leaders from both sides of the political divide are expected to attend the meeting but State House sources told The Star there will be no political talk. But NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga told journalists on Monday that the prayers are part of preparations for the elections. "Tutakuwa na maombi siku ya Saba Saba kwa sababu tunataka kuanza hiyo ziara ya kuelekea kwa nane nane," he said. This means: "We will have prayers on Saba Saba because we want to start the journey to Nane Nane." The general election will take place on August 8. Nairobi secretary Robert Ayisi said Evangelical Alliance of Kenya booked the park for prayers and that NASA and Jubilee leaders were only invited to the function. After the fete, the coalitions will part ways for campaign rallies to sell their agenda for the August 8 poll. Uhuru Kenyatta's Jubilee Party will hold a rally in Turkana while Raila's team will be at Kamukunji grounds in Nairobi.
