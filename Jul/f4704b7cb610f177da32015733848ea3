"Early this morning, a friend of mine George is leaving the Wizkid concert at around 4am. At the KICC gate right next to the City Hall, he and his friends witness a police officer shoot at a girl who was riding shotgun, for no reason at all. At this point, they could have decided to run away like the rest of the people, but what happened next is something I consider brave. He and his friends confronted the policeman to ask why he did that. You will see it in the videos attached below. They confront him and try to force him to go to the police station and record a statement and that is when this policeman decides to threaten him saying "Nitakuua." This is a uniformed police officer being asked to account and instead decides to threaten the life of the witness. Now, the cops have released the "shooting incident report" from the KICC Police station under OB number 04/23/07/2017. "It was reported by No. 107524 p.c Reagan Akoko that while controlling crowd at the entrance of KICC along City Hall way, he spotted a motor vehicle reg no. KAZ 073X which was obstructing other motorists. The officer approached the car with intention of requesting him to clear the road, however confrontation ensued and the driver of the said car grabbed the riffle of the said officer namely AK47 S/NO KP-17121095 the muzzle and extended his hand to the trigger which led to the discharge of one shot. One passenger namely Ann Wairimu, aged 23 years who was seated on the front passenger seat was hit on the right hand and left thigh causing fracture. The driver rushed her to Kenyatta national hospital where she is undergoing treatment in a stable condition." The case is currently under investigation.
