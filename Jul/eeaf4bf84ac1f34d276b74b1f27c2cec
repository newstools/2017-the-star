The government has secured a Sh500 million grant from Egypt to boost irrigation of cane farms in Bungoma. The project will be implemented in Sang'alo Institute of Science and Technology which donated 100 acres for the project. This is likely to boost the supply of cane whose shortage is blamed for the closure of Nzoia Sugar factory.

Egyptian Water and Irrigation minister Dr Mohammed Abdel said they were committed to helping Kenya develop cane. Abdel added that they will partner with Kenya to show how farmers in Egypt do cane irrigation. "We want to partner with Kenya to help them learn how we do irrigation so that they can improve their crop," he said. The Egyptian minister further said that they will partner with Kenya to show them how to store water during the dry season. Water CS Eugene Wamalwa said the project will help in making cane develop faster. He said the irrigation technology will see sugarcane mature in 10 months as opposed to the normal 18 months. "With this technology, we know farmers will be earning properly as their cane will mature faster," he said. Wamalwa said 40 boreholes will be drilled throughout the county for learning institutions to access clean drinking water.
