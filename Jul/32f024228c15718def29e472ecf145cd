Retired teachers have yet to receive a penny in salaries and pensions from the state, a Nakuru court heard yesterday.Through lawyer Dominic Kimata, the 52,000 retirees told Justice Janet Mulwa that they have not received any funds. This is contrary to claims by the National Treasury and the Teachers Service Commission that payments have been made.&ldquo;The Director of Pensions has continued to tell the court that he has acted and paid the arrears,&rdquo; Kimata said.&ldquo;But he has no documentation to show and no communication on whether [the retired] teachers have been paid.&rdquo;He urged the court not to lift the Sh200,000 fine or 14 days in civil jail it had warranted to the director.The retirees want Director of Pensions Shem Nyakutu to explain why he has not honoured the promise he made in court regarding the disbursement of Sh1.5 billion in 30 days to teachers who retired from 1997 onward.They also wanted the TSC, through its chief executive officer Nancy Macharia, to tell the court why it has not included salary components expected to be awarded to them.&ldquo;The Teachers Service Commission says in its documents that it dispatched Sh14billion to the retirees, but not a single penny has been paid to my clients,&rdquo; Kimata said.In March, Nyakutu said he had complied with the court orders to remit the money to the claimants and asked for more time to conclude the process.The court yesterday directed the TSC and the director to file submissions regarding the applications by the former teachers within 14 days.Cavin Anyuor, acting for the TSC, told the court that the Director of Pensions has received 836 claim forms for purposes of payments.He also said the commission has 24,000 forms ready and waiting for the director to collect to allow rollout of payments.Anyuor said the Teachers Service Commission is almost done with processing of the retirees&rsquo; forms.He added that more than 10,000 forms have been completed and are only awaiting collection by the Director of Pensions.Mulwa ordered the Director of Pensions to collect the claims completed by TSC, process them and forward them to the Controller of Budget to start payments immediately.The case will be mentioned on September 19 for parties to give information on the progress made on the payments.
