Former CDF Board chairman Peter Mbau has urged Maragua residents to elect him as MP so he can finish the projects he had started before being voted out in 2013.He was the area MP from 2002 to 2013.Mbau said he had initiated numerous capital community projects that have now stalled.The projects, he said, were aimed at improving the welfare of his constituents but his successor, Peter Mwangi, concentrated on other projects.Mbau, who is running as an independent candidate, said the Murang&rsquo;a Technical Training College that he had started in Maragua town remains incomplete.He said he started constructing the college after the then Murang&rsquo;a College of Technology became a constituent college of Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology.&ldquo;I realised that many local students who went to the college to study technical courses had been displaced and needed an alternative institution,&rdquo; the former legislator said.The technical training college, he added, sits on land that belonged to Maragua Secondary School and had been allocated Sh250 million by the Ministry of Education.An initial Sh50 million was disbursed and construction work began before the 2013 elections, but stopped when he was voted out.Mbau also cited the multi-billion-shilling wholesale market that had been initiated by the Trade ministry on 20 acres in Maragua town.&ldquo;The ministry fenced the land on which the market, which would provide a market for all local agricultural produce, would sit, but again, it was never developed,&rdquo; he added.
