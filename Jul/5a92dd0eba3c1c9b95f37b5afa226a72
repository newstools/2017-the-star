The Judiciary has expressed concern over IEBC's decision to continue the printing of ballot papers while the matter is in court.Justice David Maraga registered his disquiet on Tuesday saying the move might hamper the August 8 general election.The debate featured at the Annual Judges Conference taking place in Mombasa.The tender was awarded to Dubai's Al Ghurair Printing and Publishing Company. NASA principal Raila Odinga linked President to the award and the coalition moved to court to oppose it. A ruling will be delivered on Friday.IEBC said the printing of ballot papers for other candidates, apart from the presidential contenders and for cases where appeals have been lodged, is being done.But Maraga, who cited appeals in court, said: "There will be a problem."He said it will be "untidy" to remove candidate's name from ballot papers if the court rules the person is unsuitable."Assume a situation where IEBC has printed ballot papers with a governor candidate's name then the court decides such a candidate should not be on the ballot," he said."It becomes untidy to add the name of that person."On Monday, Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu bashed the commission for proceeding with the printing of ballot papers.The Opposition has also questioned why the IEBC was quick to print the papers despite the confusion and legal battles surrounding the matter.NASA feels Uhuru influenced the award of the tender to the Dubai firm and wants it revoked so due procedure is followed.There are fears the standoff can delay the polls.Maraga denied that he was referring to the Al Ghurair case when he said the Judiciary will not make a ruling that can lead to the postponement of the election."When I spoke in Homa Bay, I was not referring at all [to the case] and I did not have it in mind," he said.He said the courts will deal with cases that arise from the elections within the constitutional time frame.Read: Judiciary won't make decisions that will delay election, says CJ MaragaAlso read: Cancelling ballot papers tender recipe for constitutional crisis, AG warns
