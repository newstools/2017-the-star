A Mt Elgon politician has asked Deputy President William Ruto to let the people decide who to vote for come August 8 but ensure IDPs are compensated.Independent MP candidate Harry Kimutai told Ruto, who will tour the constituency on Monday, to keep off its political affair.The DP will visit the area, which is a Jubilee Party stronghold, to drum up for he and President Uhuru Kenyatta's re-election for another five-year term.Kimutai said Ruto should not impose or campaign for any politician in the area as residents already know who they will elect.He said since independence, the region has lagged behind in various sectors so there is need for change on election day."The people of Mt Elgon have said they do not want the old leadership that has denied them meaningful change. They said they want me to redeem them...we don't want Ruto to interfere by campaigning for anyone when he visits," he told The Star by phone on Friday.But Kimutai said Mt Elgon will vote for Uhuru and Ruto due to their development track record.He also asked Ruto to ensure he goes with money for resettling Mt Elgon IDPs who have suffered for long, much like has been the case in other parts of Kenya.Uhuru handed out cheques to IDPs in counties including Nyamira and Kisii. He pledged that post-election violence will never take place under his watch.See: [VIDEO] Never again, Uhuru says as state pays Nyamira IDPs Sh470 millionKimutai was defeated by Fred Kapondi in the Jubilee primaries.
