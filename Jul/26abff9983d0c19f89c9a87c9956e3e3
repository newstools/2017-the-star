Embu governor candidate Cyrus Njiru, an independent, has teamed up with more than 40 independent MCA and MP candidates to bolster his campaign.And he backs theirs.The former Transport PS has launched county-wide rallies, saying Embu&rsquo;s future lies with independents.Njiru yesterday said in Kibugu town that the independents have skills, experience and passion to transform the county.They were rigged out during the nominations, he said.Njiru condemned &ldquo;the barbaric manner in which my rivals and those of other independent candidates campaign&rdquo;, saying their posters are defaced.Njiru faces a tough race against incumbent Martin Wambora of the Jubilee Party, Senator Lenny Kivuti of Maendeleo Chap Chap and Kithinji Kiragu (PNU).He deplored underhand tactics by some contestants. The ex-PS wants them to talk about issues and says the final decision lies with voters, &ldquo;who have been scrutinising their leadership abilities&rdquo;.The independents plans to visit every corner of the county.Njiru dismissed incumbents for letting the county down.&ldquo;They have spent four years wrangling, instead of delivering on their promises,&rdquo; he said.He praised President Uhuru Kenyatta &ldquo;for urging voters to elect the person they deem suitable to lead the &mdash; without considering party affiliations&rdquo;.Uhuru toured the county on Thursday last week and was cautious not to alienate independents and their supporters.However, the president calls for six-piece Jubilee Party voting in other regions.Njiru dismissed his opponents &ldquo;as politicians, arguing that the governor&rsquo;s office requires a manager&rdquo;.&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t have the capability to run the county. I&rsquo;m the only one qualified for the coveted office,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;The office is quite sensitive and demanding. &ldquo;It requires somebody with the know-how and experience in managing big institutions and handling big monies and resources.&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been tested and have the experience to manage the county.&rdquo;&ldquo;Having served 53 countries and as Kenya&rsquo;s permanent secretary, running the county to the greatest height of development will be very easy for me. I urge the electorate to pick me during the August 8 election.&rdquo;He said Embu needs a leader who is focussed, honest, accountable and able to unite residents and politicians.This way, they can work together for a common goal and that&rsquo;s the only way the county&rsquo;s problems can be solved, Njiru said.He described himself as a selfless, humble and devoted leader, &ldquo;having the qualities that the county urgently needs for the benefit of all&rdquo;.
