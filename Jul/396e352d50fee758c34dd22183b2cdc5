They have killed many and left others injured.&ldquo;The government&rsquo;s first responsibility is the safety and security of its people," Lone noted."Jubilee&rsquo;s continuing failures on this cardinal priority reflects its total indifference, not only to providing security but also in alleviating the grave economic and social challenges Kenyans face."The adviser noted the latest incidents of insecurity are a cause for serious concern as they are occurring right before the election set for August 8.Adding insecurity is the greatest cause of low voter turnout on election day, he noted the need for measures to secure Kenya.Lone said hunger also become a thing of the past and that the cost of living should be lowered.
