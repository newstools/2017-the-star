The Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company has reassured Nairobians on water safety in the wake of a cholera outbreak that has killed four people in one month.The firm said it is monitoring and testing water at a number of sampling points every day. &ldquo;The NCWSC would like to assure our customers that water from our network is safe to drink,&rdquo; corporate affairs manager Mbaruku Vyakweli said yesterday.The Health ministry formed a national task force to handle cholera cases has affected more than 300 people since May. Last week, the ministry ordered two high-end eateries shut over links with cholera infections.They are Jacaranda Hotel and San Valencia. This was after Treasury CS Henry Rotich, his Industrialisation counterpart Adan Mohammed and other people were treated for cholera-like symptoms after they ate food at a trade event at the KICC.But a manager at San Valencia termed the order &ldquo;ridiculous&rdquo;.&ldquo;This hotel is too clean and it is a chain. It has outlets in Kampala and other parts of East Africa. This facility has been inspected several times by City Hall and has been given a clean bill of health,&rdquo; the manager said.Jacaranda sales manager Liz Tapawa said the hotel does not offer catering services to the KICC and Rotich has never been to the hotel.She said the hotel has been operational and neither its staff nor guests have been affected by cholera.Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero has also said the county Health and Environment departments are working round the clock to ensure directives issued by both the national and county government are implemented.His administration had stopped operations of all unlicenced boreholes and water bowsers. On Wednesday, Health CS Cleopa Mailu said 381 cholera cases have been confirmed in 12 counties.
