Independent candidates are on the spot over the use of their former parties&rsquo; colours and symbols.Party nominees are concerned over what they term undue voter influence by rivals they defeated in the primaries.At the IEBC Electoral Code of Conduct Enforcement Committee, majority of cases being filed involve use of party colours, symbols and either President Uhuru Kenyatta or NASA Presidential candidate Raila Odinga&rsquo;s portraits.Independent candidates John Njoroge (Kasarani), Laikipia Governor aspirant Nderitu Muriithi, Migori governor aspirant Ochillo Ayacko and Vihiga Governor Moses Akaranga top the list.Tomorrow, the committee chaired by IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati, will give its verdict on the accusations.Njoroge is accused by Jubilee candidate Mercy Gakuya of using the red colours associated with party and the symbol of clasped hands.Muriithi is accused of using Uhuru&rsquo;s portrait and Jubilee colours. Yesterday, he denied using Jubilee colours but admitted having Uhuru and DP William Ruto&rsquo;s portraits on his campaign materials.&ldquo;No law bars me from using portraits of a Presidential candidate of my choice,&rdquo; Muriithi told journalists.Governor Akaranga, who is seeking reelection on PPK, said he has an agreement with NASA principals to use their photos in his posters.Last month, IEBC disqualified Rarieda independent Netto Adhola after he failed to pay Sh250,000 fine within the stipulated time for using ODM colours.The committee had directed him to pay the fine within 48 hours.
