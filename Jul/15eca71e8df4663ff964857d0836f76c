Kuppet has rejected the proposal by Education CS Fred Matiang&rsquo;i to introduce day scholars in national schools.&ldquo;Education provision should not be pegged on food and accommodation. The government should develop day schools to the status of national schools,&rdquo; secretary general Akelo Misori said.He spoke on Saturday during the Nyamira Kuppet branch AGM &ldquo;Issues of facilities in schools including laboratories, libraries and staffing norms should be addressed. Some schools lack the basic facilities and the government should close the gap between the schools,&rdquo; Misori said.Matiang&rsquo;i recently said the ministry is exploring the possibility of having day streams in national schools. This has attracted mixed reactions.
