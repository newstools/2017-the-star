Online platforms are full of shocking political hate content,
just 21 days to Election Day. So much so that the Communications Authority,
in new guidelines on Friday, ordered social media sites to pull down accounts
that disseminate hate speech within 24 hours of being notified by government. The volume of vitriol posted on social media ahead of the
forthcoming 12th General Election is indeed worrying and
all-too-reminiscent of the misuse of SMS in the run-up to the 10th
election in 2007, that culminated in the post-election violence and dreadful
crisis. The inflaming of passions, explicit insults and abuse, call
for swift intervention by the National Cohesion and Integration Commission. But
what does the NCIC do on a routine workday? They had better show a sign of life, the hate is spilling
over from online to the political rallies, complete with heckling and stone
throwing. As for the broad masses, if you donâ€™t like what the next
fellow is saying, exercise your right to stay away from him and all his works.
