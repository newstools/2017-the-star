KUPPET has rejected the proposal by Education CS Fred Matiang&rsquo;&iacute; to introduce the day system at national schools.Secretary general Akello Misori said the move is ill-advised and that the government should instead improve infrastructure in the learning institutions.&ldquo;Education should not be pegged on food and accommodation. The government should develop day schools of the status of national schools,&rdquo; he said on Saturday during the Nyamira KUPPET branch Annual General Meeting at Guardian Hotel.&ldquo;Issues of facilities in schools, including laboratories, libraries and staffing norms should be addressed. Some schools lack basic facilities...the government should close the gap between schools.&rdquo;Matiang&rsquo;i said the ministry is exploring the possibility of having day streams in national schools. The announcement during the secondary schools annual conference in Mombasa has attracted mixed reactions.Misori also warned NASA and Jubilee Party that implementing free secondary education will not be a walk in the park.&ldquo;&Iuml;f the remittance of free primary education and tuition funds for secondary schools is challenging, how are they going to implement the free education?"The secretary general said the coalitions should have done wider consultation before coming up with the policy, whose benefits he acknowledged.President Uhuru Kenyatta promised that secondary education will be completely free in three years.He pointed out that his administration has increased the free day secondary education expenditure by 33 per cent to Sh32 billion as it prepares to make universal secondary education free to ensure 100 per cent transition from primary to secondary school.NASA, whose flag bearer is Raila Odinga, made the same promise but Uhuru told him free education cannot be implemented within 100 days of taking office after the August 8 general election.Read: Secondary education to be free in 2019, says UhuruAlso read: Free high school education can&rsquo;t happen in 100 days, says UhuruKitutu Masaba parliamentary candidate Edward Obwocha (Ford Kenya) asked teachers to support his bid.&ldquo;&Auml;s a teacher, I&rsquo;m one of your own.
