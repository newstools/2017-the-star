An earthquake with a magnitude of 5.3 on the richter scale on Sunday hit a region in southwestern Uganda some 105 km from Mbarara. Media reports in Uganda that quoted US based Geological Survey (USGS) said the quake, occurring at a depth of 10 kilometers (6.2 miles), was also felt in parts of northern Tanzania. Ugandaâ€™s CGTN said no injuries or deaths were reported after the early Sunday quake. Destructive earthquakes typically have magnitudes between about 5.5 and 8.9 on the basis of seismograph oscillations.
