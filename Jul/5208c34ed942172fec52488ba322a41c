Kenyan duo of Dominic Kipkemboi and George Manangoi are expected to deliver the the host country's first gold medal when they line up in the boys&rsquo; 1500m final at the ongoing IAAF World Under-18 Championships at Moi Stadium, Kasarani this evening.The two youngsters are expected to emulate their senior peers, who have dominated the event for years with Manang&rsquo;oi tipped to follow in the footsteps of his senior brother Elijah Manag&rsquo;oi, the world silver medallist over the distance.The tow won their respective heats with Kipkemboi leading from the gun to the tape, clearly cutting himself from the rest of the field for a 3:48.77 win.&ldquo;I am very impressed only that I got a small injury and almost stopped towards the finish line. However there is still more to be done as finals beckon on Friday,&rdquo; Kipkemboi said.He beat Oussama Cherrad of Algeria to second in 3:48.93 as Ethiopia&rsquo;s Abebe Dessassa finished third in 3:49.58.&ldquo;I am well prepared and teamwork will earn us gold. That is what we have been discussing,&rdquo; he revealed.Just like in steeplechase (2000m and 3000m), the 1500m event has been Kenya&rsquo;s most cherished race and which they have continued to dominate at the international stage, year-in, year-out.Manangoi clocked 3:55.00 in heat two, defeating Ethiopia&rsquo;s Belete Mekonen in second in 3:56.31 as Daniel Kiprop of Uganda came third in 3:58.68.&ldquo;I believe in myself and you saw I didn&rsquo;t want to strain. Kipkemboi beat me in the national trials but we will be teaming up in the final to deliver medals for the country,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;We want to emulate what our mentors Asbel Kiprop and Elijah Manangoi have done and give Kenya the gold medal in this event. We are praying that fate will favour us,&rdquo; Manangoi added.It is race in which Kenya and Ethiopia are expected to extend their rivalry in the age-group cadre.Alongside the Ethiopians, Uganda&rsquo;s Hosea Kiplangat and Cherrad of Algeria are expected to give the homeboys a run for their money.
