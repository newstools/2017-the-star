Lagdera MP Mohamed Shidiye has denied claims on social media that a new subcounty has been created in his constituency.He denied the rumour that Banane in Wajir county has been carved out of Lagdera constituency, Garissa county.Speaking to journalists yesterday, he accused neighbours in Wajir South of using social media to cause disharmony between residents of both areas over the creation of a subcounty.He said residents of the two counties have lived in peace for years.Last week, it was rumoured that Banane ward in Lagdera had been made a subcounty instead of Shantaabaq, also in Garissa.Shidiye said the rumours are meant to divert the attention of Lagdera residents. During a meeting with local leaders, the President had instructed Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery to gazette Shantaabaq and Liboi subcounties in Garissa.&ldquo;After our request to the President, he gave us the two subcounties. As local leaders, we are still firm on what we had agreed with him,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He will soon be visiting Garissa, where he will give out the two subcounties so these rumours that are doing the rounds should be disregarded.&rdquo;Shidiye, who was with elders from his constituency, also called on residents to remain calm as they wait for the government to work on the matter.
