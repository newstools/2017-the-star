Kambas will not be swayed by Jubilee goodies to back the ruling coalition for a second term, Kitui Governor Julius Malombe has said.Malombe said residents are not ready for the bait and that they will shock the nation by voting for Kalonzo Musyoka who is NASA flag bearer Raila Odinga's running mate.The other Opposition principals are Musalia Mudavadi (Amani National Congress), Isaac Rutto (Chama cha Mashinani) and Moses Wetang'ula (Ford-Kenya).Malombe, who spoke at Tseikuru in Mwingi North on Monday, said Ukambani cannot gamble with the August vote as it is important to 2022 ambitions.This followed revelations by Raila that he will only deliver Kenyans to 'Canaan' and then hand the baton to Kalonzo.The ODM leader did not specify when this will be but indications are they agreed he serves one term should NASA form the next government."Don't fall for bait. Let Jubilee use them but make sure we maintain our stands on the general election," Malombe said."We cannot be used like that. Kalonzo is the only Kamba saviour and we should make sure he gets the top seat."Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho also asked his people to do this.Read: Take 'tourist' Uhuru's money but vote for NASA, Joho tells Coast residentsThe Governor further said the only way to support Kalonzo is by making sure the region votes six-piece for Wiper, which is the former President's party."Anything outside Wiper should not be considered since it will weaken the party," the governor said.Malombe criticised Jubilee's development projects in the region saying they only toured after being in power for 52 months."They only came to Mwingi North to relaunch projects which were initiated by Kalonzo."On his Ukambani tour, President Uhuru Kenyatta launched a Sh1.4 billion water project for the region.But Malombe said the venture is note enough to win the hearts of Ukambani voters, adding he has done more than enough for the people of Kitui.Also read: Uhuru's supporters will yield nothing on Ukambani vote hunting mission - KibwanaMore on this: We are not in Jubilee Party by mistake, Ukambani MPS say
