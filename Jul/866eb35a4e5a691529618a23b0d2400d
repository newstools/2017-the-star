The state has spent more than Sh600 million to re-carpet major roads in Garissa town. Kenya Urban Roads Authority acting general manager for special projects Eng. Abdulrashid Mohamed told journalists  more than four kilometres of dilapidated roads have been upgraded. He spoke yesterday in Garissa town. The sections of the road that have been completed include Biashara Street and Posta, Ngamia, Garissa Ndogo, Sankuri and Deka Buri roads. Mohamed said the projects are part of the 10,000 kilometres of roads the Jubilee administration promised to re-carpet or construct during its first term in office. KURA is also undertaking other urban roads projects at a cost of Sh89 million and they are expected to be complete within 18 months, he said. The official said similar projects are ongoing in Wajir, including a bypass. Mohamed said, however, that encroachment on road reserves causes problems during construction and “leaves no space for pedestrian walk ways within the towns. “I am urging the urban residents to keep off the road reserves for their own benefit. These roads are being improved because of them,” he added.
