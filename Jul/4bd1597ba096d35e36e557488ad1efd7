Rwanda, the land of the 1994 Genocide in which a million
died in barely four weeks, has an election three days before Kenya’s on August
4, but there is not as much concern and nervousness about that poll as there
are about Kenya’s in the wider world. The IEBC’s suspension of the governor campaign in Marsabit
county should be commended. The electoral agency is fast-acquiring a reputation
for concrete action in real time, something all of its predecessors could only
dream about. The IEBC has become so proactive against campaign violence that it
has levied million-shilling fines against senior politicians and their
accomplices. There are such high stakes in Kenya’s 12th
General Election that every element of violence should be nipped in the bud and
the perpetrators given exemplary punishment. The IEBC needs to do more, more swiftly and remain firm and
steadfast. There are too many reports of violence in places such as
Siaya, Migori and Uasin Gishu.
