Vihiga MP Yusuf Chanzu has denied allegations by Governor Moses Akaranga that his decision to run for governor was triggered by his brother’s failure to get employment in the county government. On Friday during his manifesto launch in Mbale Municipal Grounds, Akaranga said Chanzu is bitter because his brother did not get a job as a chief officer. The governor, who is defending his seat on the Progressive Party of Kenya, said Chanzu’s brother applied for the job, but there were more qualified people than him. But Chanzu of ANC on Saturday said his brother was shortchanged. “My brother has been a veterinary doctor in the county for many years, but he was denied an opportunity to serve Vihiga people,” the MP said. Chanzu said his brother, like any other person in Vihiga, has the right to get employed in the county. Akaranga said there is no reason why Chanzu is angry with him, yet there are employment agencies that vet job applicants. Chanzu also refuted claims by Akaranga that his running mate, Billy Nyonje, is still a member of Maendeleo Democratic Party. The MP said Nyonje and Akaranga fell out when contractors were not being paid by the county government. Chanzu said Akaranga’s reasons for skipping the governor debates were “fake”. Three governor debates have been held. Akaranga said he did not attend the debates because his opponents have “integrity issues”. Two others are seeking to unseat Akaranga. They are Emuhaya MP Wilbur Otichilo of ODM and independent candidate Josephat Amadi.
