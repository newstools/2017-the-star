Former Just A Band lead singer Blinky Bill has signed with Temple Management to push his music and represent his brand world wide. “I have been working for a long time on my own music and it’s really good to have [Temple Management], a team that believes in me and the work I do. I am working on my album right now and it’s going to be lit, and it’s really nice to be working with a team that will ensure that the album goes all the way to the top,” Blinky said. Speaking on the new addition to the Temple family, Troy White, the managing director, said,“Blinky Bill is our first signing [in East Africa] because he is one of the most creative artists on this continent. This brother’s mind and thought process and his music is the kind that can touch the world. “From the first time I met Blinky, I wanted to work with him. His mind is where my mind is and our minds are where Temple East Africa and Temple Africa are at.” Blinky joins a number of top African artistes signed to the management, including Iyanya, DJ Jimmy Jatt and the Mavins Record label family, among others.
