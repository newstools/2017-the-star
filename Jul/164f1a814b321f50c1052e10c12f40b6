It&rsquo;s no secret that I love pastries, and this particular recipe was first introduced to me when I lived in France a few years ago, I immediately fell in love with it. Tarte Tatin is a French upside-down pastry with fruit caramelised in butter and sugar before the tarte is baked. It&rsquo;s usually made with apples, although spiced pears are a particular favourite of mine, and I&rsquo;m sure you will agree that the result is a rustic yet delicious dessert.Pastry200g all-purpose flour3tbsp sugar&frac12; tbsp. salt170g cold unsalted butter cubed80ml full fat sour creamFilling115g unsalted butter200g granulated sugar6 large pears cored and halved&frac12; tbsp. ground cardamom&frac12; tbsp. ground cinnamon1 egg beaten for glazingMethod
