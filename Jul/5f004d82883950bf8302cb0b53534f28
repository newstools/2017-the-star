More than 200 public utilities have been grabbed in Kisii and the anti-graft agency has instituted civil suits to recover public property belonging to the county. Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission vice chairperson Sophia Lepuchirit said the organisation has already recovered two parcels. She spoke yesterday at Governor James Ongwae’s office when EACC officials paid him a courtesy call. “We look forward to seeing the conclusion of the recovery for the common good of the people of Kenya and especially Kisii,” Lepuchirit said. The commission cannot win the war on corruption on its own and needs help from county governments. Lepuchirit, who represented chairman Eliud Wabukala, was with commissioner Dabar Maalim, the commission’s South Nyanza director Abraham Kemboi and other officials. The vice chairperson said that last year, the EACC carried out a Corruption Risk Assessment into systems, policies, procedures and practices in Kisii county to identify and seal corruption loopholes. After the assessment, a report of the findings was given to the county for implementation, she said. “The commission is carrying out various investigations on alleged acts of corrupt and unethical conduct by some officials at the county,” Lepuchirit said. The commission, she said, will continue to train county officers on methods of preventing corruption. Maalim warned county officials against enriching themselves from public coffers. Anyone found stealing taxpayers’ money will not be spared, he said.
