Deputy President William will return to Bungoma this week with a basket of goodies to woo a region widely perceived as a NASA stronghold.The visit, barely two weeks after one with President Uhuru Kenyatta, shows the ruling Jubilee Party is fighting to make in roads in the county .The Deputy President is expected to issue close to 1,000 title deeds to residents of Ndalu in Tongaren constituency ."The DP will issue titles in Wanangwe, Kapchonge and James Mweyi farms," said David Mgonyi who is his head of communication.Ruto is also expected to tour areas including Mt Elgon and Malaha in Webuye East on Monday.Political commentators say he is keen on Bungoma because the county has the highest number of elected politicians supporting Jubilee.The Governor is Kenneth Lusaka and the Senator Moses Wetang'ula, who is Ford Kenya leader and a NASA principal."If there is a county where NASA should re-strategise, it is Bungoma. Jubilee is keen because it has very powerful politicians including Lusaka and Sirisia MP John Waluke," said political analyst Isaack Wanjekeche.Wanjekeche added that the Opposition's decision to field candidates for each party was a great undoing .The county has been earmarked by NASA strategists as it's stronghold, with registered voters numbering 559, 000.Water CS Eugene Wamalwa has been leading the Jubilee onslaught with Lusaka, Waluke, Webuye west MP Dan Wanyama and Bumula's Boniface Otsiula.During a tour of Western in June, the President asked Luhyas to stop wasting time in the Opposition as NASA can never beat Jubilee.He termed the Opposition disorganised and noted he and Ruto won the last general election, despite having cases at the ICC when Raila Odinga was PM and Kalonzo Musyoka the VP.Read: NASA can never beat Jubilee, Uhuru tells Western, laughs off strategiesBut in January, Ruto was forced to change his route and cancel a rally after youths turned violent and barricaded Bungoma bus stage.Accusing the Jubilee administration of neglecting them, the youths said they could not allow the DP to address them.More on this: [VIDEO] Ruto forced to change route after Bungoma youths turn violentAlso read: DP Ruto to blame for rejection of Jubilee in Western, says Anangwe
