Nairobi governor aspirants on Monday tore into each other in an attempt to win the hearts of voters to elect them on August 8.The candidates, in a debate hosted by KTN at the Daystar University, were put to task on their vision for the city county.Incumbent Evans Kidero, Mike Sonko (Jubilee Party), Peter Kenneth (Independent), and Miguna Miguna attended the debate moderated by KTN News editor Joe Ageyo.The hawker menace, the matatu troubles and lack of social amenities namely water and markets featured in the discussion.Kidero was put to task over perceptions that the city charges higher taxes compared to the services residents enjoy from the remittances.The governor defended his administration saying it has streamlined the revenue collection in the county.He said the county, under his watch, has seen the cost of doing business in the capital reduced.He said the county has since its inception cut trading licences and also reduced fees charged on matatus."All the fees charged by the county are passed by the county assembly through a public participation process," Kidero said.But he was challenged by Miguna and Kenneth who said that traders they have spoken to say they are still reeling under the burden of having to pay higher rates to run their business."Poor people are crying to earn a living. The small scale traders are also facing threats posed by an uncontrolled city inspectorate which threatens their lives," Miguna said.Kenneth, who is former Gatanga MP, said there are aspects of the licensing that needs to be relooked."Revenue charged by the current administration has pushed the cost of business higher. We need a balance between growing business and the revenue appetite," he said.The candidates were also taken to task on how they plan to deal with the hawker menace which emerged to be a problem of lack of space for the vendors to trade their wares.Miguna said he will build modern markets for the traders and rein in rogue inspectorate officials whereas Kenneth urged for a proper plan to solve the problem once and for all.Kidero, on the other hand, said he the county is already working on a plan to give hawkers space in strategic locations within the city."We have started works to decongest Wakulima market. We are also building a modern market at Kariokor and will also set up a trading hub for hawkers in Eastlands," he said.Sonko, for his part, said the problem of hawkers is as a result of markets set aside for the traders being grabbed."My first assignment will be to repossess the grabbed lands in Eastleigh, Mwariro among other areas that the hawkers were dispossessed of," the legislator said.The leaders were also tasked to show residents their suitability to run the city's affairs, a question that bordered on management experience.On this, Kidero said his record at the city speaks for itself adding that residents should feel free to 'engage the county on any questions on the same instead of listening to political talk'."I am a reliable and dependable leader who understands that activism doesn't make one a great manager."For his part, Sonko said he is qualified for the job having graduated from Kenya Methodist University further adding that he is vying for the seat alongside a technocrat who will augment his ideas as he handles the political wing of the city's management.Former Kenya Association of Manufactures and Vivo Energy MD Polycarp Igathe is Sonko's running mate."I will delegate duties to my deputy and at the same time apply my knowledge to ensure the city runs efficiently."Miguna, on the other hand, said he is a man of integrity who will rid the city of graft and incompetence that has scuttled its development."My friends here have questions on their integrity. We need to ask about their ideology and socio-economic philosophy which I believe they lack," he said."Nairobi needs to get a software of a governor who is a leader and not merely a manager."Kenneth said he is proud of his record at previous institutions he has run namely Kenya Re further adding that the city needs a leader who is not only competent but also has integrity required of holders of the county's top seat."Nairobi needs a leader who can bring the managerial agenda and also provide leadership from the top," the ex-legislator said.On jobs for the youth, Sonko said he has already rolled out programmes that benefit young people adding that he has empowered most of them.The Senator runs the 'Sonko Rescue Team' which he says has enabled a number of young city dwellers shun crime as they have a means of survival."With me at the helm of the county, we can only expect to do more," the senator said, further denying links to drugs trade in the city."The only drugs I know are the ones I supply to doctors when I organise medical camps," Sonko said.The debate was not without drama as each of the aspirants attempted to dig into the other's past in the line of their previous state duties, criminal records as well as issues to do with general public demeanor.At times, the attacks became personal, forcing the convener to remind the participants to adhere to the rules of objectivity as they woo Nairobians to support their bids.
