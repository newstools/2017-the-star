Kiambu Speaker Gathii Irungu has said MCAs who decamped to ODM on Monday will be punished.The Speaker said the ward representatives risk losing their seats and that the matter will be pursued in line with the law.Irungu said none of the eight members who defected to ODM officially notified him. "If one defects to another party, they definitely lose their seat," he noted at the county assembly premises on Monday.Section 194 (1) (d) of the constitution stipulates that an MCA can only be removed if he or she resigns by notifying the Speaker in writing.On Monday, NASA leader Raila Odinga received 13 defectors, mostly sitting MCAs and aspirants from Kiambu county.But Irungu said most members are in Jubilee and that independents are supporting President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto."I assure Kiambu residents that despite the defections, the county remains a Jubilee zone," he said.Out of the 88 assembly members only four managed to get Jubilee tickets during the April primaries.They are Cecilia Wamaitha (Gatuanyaga), Philip Mubea (Cianda), Jackie Nungari (Bibirioni) and Ndiba Thandi (Uthiru. At least 18 MCAs are defending their seats as independents following dissatisfaction with the nominations.Hospital MCA Mwangi wa Mwangi said his defection to Raila's camp reflected his democratic right to be in any party."Since I lost the nominations I opted to weigh options for my political career," he said.More on this: Raila receives 13 Kiambu defectors ahead of NASA tour
