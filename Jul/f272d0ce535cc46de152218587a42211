A Baringo student died on Thursday while seven others were admitted in critical condition after drinking methanol at Kolowa Secondary School in Tiaty.Philemon Limo, 17, narrated his ordeal at Mercy Private Hospital in Eldama-Ravine on Saturday, after taking the substance on Wednesday.The form four student blamed the devil saying he tempted him to take the substance after it was sneaked into a dormitory by a form two student.He said they earlier helped a lab technician move equipment to a better structure due to high temperatures in the area."I tested a little to see the reaction. I got drunk and later developed abdominal complications that came with piercing pain."Limo said he could only remember being rushed to Parpello Mission hospital."I found myself on a Mercy hospital bed on Friday..I am feeling well again but I can't see," he told journalists while waiting for an optician to examine him."I want to see again and get well soon so I can go back to School and study for my final exam," he continued, adding the rest of his body was in good condition.Limo's schoolmate died shortly after arriving in hospital while another who was admitted with him was discharged today.Mercy Hospital clinical officer James Orodi said they tried their best to save the life but could not."We saved the lives of the two students after administering ethanol which is an antidote," he said and described what the students took as a highly intoxicating laboratory substance that easily causes severe side effects and death.Orodi said they did not have clear information on what transpired at the school before the incident but he advised caution. Such incidents have been reported at several schools across the country."There must be a technician during practicals to ensure students don't tamper with chemicals which are dangerous or take them outside the laboratory," Orodi said.He added that access to labs should be restricted.Head teacher Zakayo Domokon said students broke into the laboratory and stole an entire container of methanol."They stole it, went to their dormitory and took it," he said, adding those who mixed it with water suffered less than those who did not.He said three with severe injuries were rushed to Mercy while the rest were treated at Barpello mission hospital and discharged on Friday.
