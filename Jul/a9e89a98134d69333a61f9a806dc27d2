Police officers on trial over the murders of human rights lawyer Willie Kimani and two others were dealt a blow on Thursday after the High Court declined to delay the case.Lawyers representing to officers wanted more time despite the fact that the high-profile murder trial resumed after a two-month break.The legal brass sought the extension to allow them appeal against a decision that rejected their bid to bar victims from cross &ndash;examining witnesses.Trial judge Jessie Lessit said the request by the defence team was premature.The judge also declined to expunge crucial evidence that was introduced by lawyers representing victims in the case."I am unable to even consider the application as there is nothing before me," the judge saidThe AP officers are Stephen Chebulet, Fredrick Leliman, Leonard Maina, Stephen Chebulet and Silvia Wanjiku.Their trial alongside informer Peter Ngugi is now expected to run on a day-to-day basis for the next two weeks.Johana Ngoria, a police officer working at Ol Donyo Sabuk police station, gave his account of the incident.He is the one who retrieved the bodies of Kimani, his client Josphat Mwenda and driver Joseph Muiruri from Sabuk River.The officer said they were tied on their waist with gunny bags while their heads had been tied with plastic bags.The witness said the paper bags had writings pointing to the fact that they were from Mlolongo's Mulela Supermarket."The bodies had started decomposing and blood oozed from their mouths and noses."Kimani, Mwenda and Muiruri disappeared on June 23.It is suspected they were kidnapped on their way from the Mavoko law courts, briefly held in a container before they were dragged to a killing field.Kimani&rsquo;s client, Mwenda, was pursuing an attempted murder case against Leliman and refused to withdraw it.The officers have been pushing to bar the victims from asking questions in the case.Their application was raised after shocking revelations, linking yet another police officer to the killer suspects, was introduced during cross-examination.Lawyers watching brief for the family, Law Society of Kenya and International Justice Mission, relied on Facebook chats and phone data records.This was to prove that Wilson Kamau, an officer attached to an undercover unit that was headed by Leliman, called the police informer several times from June 23.This was the date the three men went missing.Justice Lessit, in a ruling, said cross-examination by the advocates for the victims does not hinder the prosecution's ability to conduct a focused probe of the matter.The judge said the victim's lawyers shall continue to participate in the proceedings.She said this was because the officers did not show what prejudice they will suffer as a result of that participation or how their rights have been affected."I find that the cross-examination by the counsel for the victims was the best avenue that a victim could use to bring out the evidence that had been left out by the prosecution."The hearing resumes Friday.
