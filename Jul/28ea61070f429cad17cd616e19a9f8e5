Some of the dignitaries had made such request."Speaker Muturi also recognised all the Kajiado MPs present during the burial ceremony.None of the key leaders recognised the presence of Governor David Nkedianye who was seated next to NASA leader Raila Odinga.The two spent most of the time consulting each other.Hellen Nkaissery, the CS's wife, had early last week cleared Nkedianye and Kajiado Central MP Elijah Memusi to be allowed to attend the burial.The two were chased out of Nkaissery's compound by close relatives of the family on claims that they had frustrated the late CS's bid to unite Kajiado residents.Nkaissery's wife held a family meeting two days to the burial where she directed that Memusi and Nkedianye were free to attend the funeral.Raila was greeted by wild applause when he rose to pay his tribute to the former Kajiado Central ODM MP. The same was when Muturi mentioned Memusi's name.The ceremony was without hitches until a man walked past presidential security detail and attempted to open Nkaissery's casket.The man, who later explained he had not believed Nkaissery was dead and wanted to see his face, was whisked away fast.Outside the main tent, a young man who lay in wait to present President Uhuru Kenyatta with his telephone number for a job was also arrested before he could do so.Also read: Nkaissery burial: Stone throwing, insults won't add you votes - Uhuru
