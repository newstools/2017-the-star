Karen Hospital has ruled out any possibilities of heart attack as the cause of CS Nkaissery's death.A senior manager at the hospital told the Star on Saturday that doctors who received the late have every reason to believe it was not a heart attack.The manager who sought anonymity said by the time the Nkaisserry arrived at the hospital he was already dead.He further dismissed claims that the late had driven himself to the hospital for check up terming the claims as mere rumors."The doctors received the late at around 1am and he was already dead. Since our profession does not allow doctors to assume, they run all the emergency procedures amid efforts to resuscitate him but unfortunately he was already past that," the manager said.The source further said in doctors assessment Nkaissery had no signs of sickness.Asked if it was poisoning, the manager said, "Doctors will not look foolish to say it was poisoning or heart attack only for postmortem to say otherwise".In their quest to establish what might have transpired, the manager said even his wife confirmed that the late CS had no signs of sickness."The doctors tried to interrogate her wife but she said the late arrived in the house at around 10pm. Had a little conversation and planned that they would leave the house at around 9am the following day for usual activities before they retired to bed at 11pm," he said.The source said, Nkaisserry 67, was brought at the hospital in company of his wife, security and two friends whom the wife said had spent the entire day together.Dectives have so far commenced investigations into the sudden death.The officers have cordoned off the CS's Nairobi home in Hardy, Karen estate and Bomas of Kenya.The two places are being swept clean seeking to collect any evidence that may be linked to his death.Read:Police cordon Nkaissery's home, Bomas of Kenya as probe beginsNkaissery served in the military for 29 years where he ascended to the rank of Major General before he joined politics in 2002.In November 2014, President Uhuru Kenyatta appointed Nkaissery as Interior CS to replace Joseph Lenku who was sacked for failing to secure the country following two massacres by the al Shabaab.
