Lamu leaders want Energy CS Charles Keter to intervene and resolve a petrol shortage that has hit Mpeketoni town for three weeks now.Transport and business operations have been disrupted.Speaking in Mpeketoni on Sunday, Deputy Governor Eric Mugo said petrol station owners are being frustrated by the Energy Regulatory Commission.He said they are being forced to sell their petrol at lower prices without factoring in the costs incurred in transporting the fuel from Mombasa to Lamu.Mugo said the ERC should find a solution to the matter, especially concerning pricing, because the commodity has become too expensive.&ldquo;Businesses have suffered due to the petrol shortage. Petrol owners no longer want to stock the commodity since they feel they are running at a loss. Middlemen have now come in and they are exploiting people. Prices must be regulated right from the commission, but even then, it must be done fairly,&rdquo; he said.
