Journalists should be left alone by politicians and their hirelings to do their job. The story of the Star newspaper journalist Eric Oloo roughed up by suspected hired goons who beat him senseless for a story published three days ago is shocking. The ringleader confronted Oloo, demanding to be told why he was writing negative articles that provoked debate and went viral on social media. They cited the report in the Star on Tuesday in which Governor Cornel Rasanga told Rarieda MP Nicholas Gumbo, who is seeking to unseat him, to blame his mother for marrying his poor father, hence his unhappy childhood. If a news source is unhappy about a reporter’s work he or she has multiple recourses to seek clarification and, or redress, beginning with the writer’s place of work, the Media Council of Kenya and, ultimately the courts, all of them eminently civic and lawful. What Oloo’s tormentors did is savagery and criminal. And it must not go comprehensively unpunished as a powerful deterrent.
