Residents of new Donholm say a juice factory in their neighbourhood is posing a health threat and making life a noisy, smelly nightmare.The National Environmental Management Authority has ordered the firm to move, saying it operates without an environmental impact license.Extremely Fresh Foods, which manufactures juices, started operations in late February.&ldquo;On March 1, there were loud noises from the blending machine. I sent a message to the owner of the house about the irritating sound,&rdquo;resident Moses Mogere, who shares a common wall with the firm, told the Star.Noise from production equipment, delivery vehicles, smell from waste and chemicals used to kill flies are some of the concerns raised by residents.A check by the Star revealed the firm is still running, despite a warning from Nema.Mogere said when the situation worsened, residents met the owner of the buildling and company management to find a solution.&ldquo;We proposed they relocate either to Light Industries in Kariobangi or Industrial Area,&rdquo; he said.Operations of the firm endanger health and safety and disrupt the neighbourhood, they said.Residents have written to City Hall, the Embakasi East Subcounty administrator and the Upper Savannah ward administrator.Officials are yet to respond, they say.Political analyst and media consultant David Makali says he is not associted with the firm. &ldquo;That is rubbish. I do not have any factory there,&rdquo; he said.Doris Tanui of Extremely Fresh Foods confirmed the company has been ordered to move. Tanui told the Star on the phone,&ldquo;We are a small-scale juice manufacturing company but we are in process of moving out.&rdquo;When residents reported to Nema, the firm said it would hire its own expert to conduct environmental assessment.Nema objected to this and said it would do its own assessment.
