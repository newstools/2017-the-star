Eight Kwale assembly members have illegally and hurriedly passed a budget of Sh7.8 billion for the 2017/18 financial year, the biggest since 2013.MCAs who made the decision on Thursday included Hidaya Fweda (Ngombeni), Omar Kitengele (Ukunda), Juma Maone (Kinondo) and Patrick Mangale (Dzombo).The others were Nassoro Mgutta (Pongwe Kikoneni), Deputy Speaker Andrew Mulei (Kubo South) and Nominated MCAs Suleiman Nzallah and Fatuma Kadzo.The ward representatives re-allocated millions of shillings to departments despite the lack of quorum for the budget to be passed.The assembly has 33 members, 20 of whom were elected, but most of them were reportedly out campaigning for the August 8 general election.Only the eight were present for the three readings and the June 29 adoption of the Finance, Budget and Appropriations Committee report on estimates for the financial year.A view of an empty Kwale county assembly, where only eight MCAs passed a Sh7.8 billion budget for the 2017/18 financial year, June 29, 2017. /ALLOYS MUSYOKANzallah was quick to defend their move claiming there was quorum and that the other MCAs were handing over ahead of the poll.About Sh177.7 million was re-allocated from different departments meant for developments to others, in what the report says was for equity purposes.Mulei led the session after Speaker Sammy Ruwa excused himself claiming he had other official matters to attend to.The budget includes Sh4.6 billion (recurrent expenditure) and Sh3.2 billion (development). The 206/17 budget totaled Sh6.2 billion.Under recurrent expenditure, employees' compensation has been projected as Sh2.4 billion, which is 31.72 per cent of the total expenditure. Other current expenditure, including operations and maintenance, is expected to amount to Sh2.125 Billion, which is 27.14 per cent of the total budget.For the first time since 2013, the county's recurrent expenditure shot up to 58.86 per cent of total revenues. It was 48 per cent in 2016.The development allocation dropped from to 41.14 per cent from 52 per cent of total revenue.Fweda , who is Finance committee chairman, moved the motion to adopt county appropriation bill 2017, which was supported by Dzombo MCA Patrick Mangale.Mangale said it will allow the county to get resources needed for effective service delivery.&ldquo;We need to provide essential services such as water, transport, education and community development. Passing this motion will allow access to the county revenue fund,&rdquo; he added.Nzalla supported the adoption of the budget for the same reason.The budget now awaits Governor Salim Mvurya's approval.In November last year, Mvurya and Deputy Governor Fatuma Achani criticised ODM leaders in the area who accused them of corruption and poor performance.Mvurya asked anyone with concerns about county expenditure to follow the right channels in addressing them, not engage in political wars.More on this: Mvurya, Achani rap ODM leaders over Kwale corruption claimsAlso read: Kwale keen to end graft, says Mvurya
