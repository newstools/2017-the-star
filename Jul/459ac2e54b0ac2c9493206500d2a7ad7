The family of a Budalang’i resident hit by a motorcycle in Deputy President William Ruto’s convoy on December 3 has appealed for medical assistance. John Ajwang, 65, says he and other residents were walking towards Port Mixed Primary School to listen to the DP when he was hit. He suffered a fractured arm and a broken thighbone. He was rushed to Port Victoria Hospital but was not treated as nurses were on strike. His family did not have money to take him to Nangina Mission Hospital, Funyula, for surgery so they took him back home. “He has been living in extreme pain,” his mother Agnes Kundu said. “We are therefore appealing to Ruto to give us funds to take him to a private hospital for surgery because we are unable to afford the cost of surgery.”
