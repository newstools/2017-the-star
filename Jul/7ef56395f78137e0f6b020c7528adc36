Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong has reached out to Teso North MP Arthur Odera and urged the legislator to help him fulfil his aspirations for the county. He was speaking at Akiriamet, Odera’s stronghold, on Wednesday. Ojaamong urged residents to vote overwhelmingly for NASA flagbearer Raila Odinga to save the country from myriad challenges, including the high cost of living. “Under the Moi regime there were many sons and daughters of Busia in the government, but they were ejected by subsequent regimes. We need a NASA government to restore sanity,” he said. Elder Nicodemus Osukuku assured Ojaamong of the community’s support, saying they cannot allow the only seat held by their son to elude them. Teso North MP candidates Lawi Mamai and Oku Kaunya urged their supporters to reelect Ojaamong and vote for Raila. Ojaamong’s wife Judy urged the Teso community to vote for her husband, saying he only has one bullet left. Ojaamong will face Paul Otuoma on August 8.
