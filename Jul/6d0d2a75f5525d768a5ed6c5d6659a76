Knut secretary general Wilson Sossion has failed teachers of this nation, Nyandarua North executive secretary Simon Kairu (pictured) has said.He said by joining NASA, and declaring openly his support for the alliance, Sossion contravened his mandate as a unionist.Speaking yesterday to the Star at Ol Kalou town, Kairu said Sossion&rsquo;s announcement that teachers will vote for NASA is far-fetched.&ldquo;He is alone. He is not with the teachers. The teachers of this country are supporting the government of the day,&rdquo; Kairu said. He said unionists are supposed to support the government of the day even as they press it to fulfil its obligations to their members.Kairu said teachers, and especially those in Nyandarua, are behind President Uhuru Kenyatta.
