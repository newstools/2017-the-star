Mombasa governor hopeful Hassan Omar has refuted speculation that he is a mole planted by Jubilee to scuttle NASA campaigns in Mombasa.In Jomvu on Monday, Governor Hassan Joho said he has only one opponent - Jubilee&rsquo;s Suleiman Shahbal.&ldquo;Our opponent is Jubilee, and if not Jubilee it is brokers of Jubilee. Some have 'spoilt for us'. They came pretending to be our friends yet they have been sent by [President] Uhuru Kenyatta and [DP] William Ruto," Joho said.&ldquo;I have information one has been sent by Ruto to come and disturb me here. I tell him, don&rsquo;t allow yourself to be sent. Tell Ruto himself to come here."Nyali MP Hezron Awiti also wants to be governor.Omar hit back on Thursday saying the Governor has no agenda for Mombasa people.The Wiper secretary general said Joho&rsquo;s main tactic is to raise fear and insult people, while pretending to fight for residents' rights.&ldquo;He does not speak of any agenda. He only chest-thumps. Sheikh, this is Mombasa, an urban constituency, not a Sheesha meeting. Speak of agenda."Read: Joho wins opinion polls, not elections, Omar says after governor leads in MombasaAlso read: NASA will punish 'dead horse' governor Joho for forgery, says OmarThe Senator further said the Governor is a 'newbie' in the fight for Kenyans' rights and referred to him as a "wannabe reformist"&ldquo;There is a friend of mine who wants you to vote for him because he chest-thumps thinking some other people are moles," he said.&ldquo;In the fight for liberation in Kenya, my Wiper friends and I have more history. When others were clearing vehicles at the port, we were fighting for liberation."He added that while Joho is fighting two people - Uhuru and Ruto - he has fought three presidents at times when no one else could say a word.&ldquo;These are just wannabe reformists of yesterday and today,&rdquo; said Omar. &ldquo;He went to Mwakirunge and instead of telling them why Mwakirunge has no water or no roads, he told them he thinks there are people working with Jubilee, so his mistakes should be forgiven."He spoke outside his office after launching his 'Road To Victory Caravan' which will see him tour all parts of the county in 30 days to sell his agenda in the grassroots.More on Mombasa race: Joho is Coast kingpin, preferred Mombasa governor - surveyAlso read: How Suleiman Shahbal plans to beat Joho in Mombasa raceOmar said that in his first 100 days in office, he will reduce taxes to make life easier for Mombasa residents should he win the election next month.He said Joho increased taxes so he could fleece the people dry and prevent them from praying.&ldquo;We will reduce taxes on small scale business people such as mama mbogas and tuk tuk and boda boda operators. We will even reduce taxes on religious institutions," he said.&ldquo;Joho increased taxes on churches so that Christians and Muslims don&rsquo;t pray...the cost of doing business will come down under my leadership."He continued: &ldquo;In the first 100 days, we will engage business people in the food industry, like in Kongowea market, so we can reduce taxes on all food stuff for prices to come down."Omar noted residents are fed up with the current state of affairs in the county and are demanding change.&ldquo;In Mombasa today, all sectors of the economy are doing badly,&rdquo; he said, adding his administration will not be lured by the trappings of power and cause unnecessary distractions.Long convoys, he said, only serve to inconvenience motorists and other road users, which is a form of oppression.&ldquo;It is oppressive for Kenyans to make 20 or 30 vehicles follow you everywhere you go,&rdquo; said the Senator.&ldquo;In Mombasa, everything has been done in a manner that violates boundaries of good governance."
