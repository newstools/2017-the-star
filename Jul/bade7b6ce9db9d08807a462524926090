Rarieda MP Nicholas Gumbo yesterday accused the IEBC of favouritism.Speaking to the Star on the phone, he said the commission treats non-ODM candidates as inferior to their Orange Party counterparts. Gumbo said he reads mischief in the manner in which the IEBC reached the decision to suspend campaigns in Siaya county for six days.The commission on Friday issued a one-week ban on political campaigns in Siaya to restore peace and order.The National Assembly PAC chairman said county returning officer Ruth Khulundu was compromised.Gumbo said ODM engineered the chaos in Siaya last Monday and Wednesday to win sympathy votes for their weak and very unpopular candidates.&ldquo;It is shocking that with so much evidence naming those who planned the chaos, the vehicles used and even the stockpiles of weapons ODM intended to use, they did not as much as get a slap on the wrist,&rdquo; he said. Gumbo is running against Governor Cornel Rasanga.He said Khulundu shared the verdict with Rasanga in advance before the other candidates converged for the meeting on Friday.&ldquo;My instincts never lie. I believe she shared her verdict with Rasanga in advance, but the electorates should not worry, those tricks will not work,&rdquo; Gumbo said. On Friday Khulundu said the decision was arrived at following the escalating of insecurity and cases of electoral malpractices across the six subcounties in the past week.She said the ban applies to all candidates across the county and urged them to respect one another.Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo, who is defending his seat as an independent candidate and supports Gumbo&rsquo;s bid, welcomed the suspension.
