You know this is a political season and everyone, especially candidates, should be free to campaign everywhere across the country.This is a show of where we are as a country in terms of democratisation.Whether you get votes is another thing altogether. First, I really applaud the people of Kiambu county for receiving opposition leader Raila Odinga and his NASA team very well. It was a show of maturity.I want to say there is nothing to be worried about for Jubilee Party from the Odinga visit to Kiambu, or any of the Jubilee backyards.The visit will hardly add him a vote in the August election because Raila, if anything, has lost most of his backyards, which have become Jubilee turf because of the development they have received from the national government. Raila has no development record.The NASA strongholds have gone Jubilee because they find some national government-initiated development in their areas.People will judge by development records when they vote. I was in Bungoma county on Monday and right now I am in Kakamega county; the ground has shifted tremendously because of Jubilee and President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s sterling development record, no other reason.People are just coming to testify; 'We did not have a road, now we have a road network'; 'We did not have electricity connected to our homes all these years, now we have electricity'; 'I was going very far for dialysis services, now there is a machine in all county hospitals which are now referral hospitals'.These are not things you can just take away from the people's memory.I was in Teso county on Monday, and asked the people to tell me what Jubilee has done for you and they were listing the achievements for me, they know them. I was shocked! There was nothing for me to go and tell them that this is what Jubilee has done. They listed all of them.Honestly speaking, you know, to defeat an incumbent government is difficult, now to defeat an incumbent government like Jubilee, which has delivered, is even more difficult, more so for someone who was in government before.Even Meru county, where the opposition leader has pitched tent, has not shifted as is being portrayed in the newspapers, and what you get when you go on the ground is completely different, those are just stories.Kuria is Gatundu South MP
