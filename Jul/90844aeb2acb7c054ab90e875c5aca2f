Former Labour CS Kazungu Kambi has said Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi is his Mombasa counterpart Hassan Joho’s ‘puppet’. Kingi has been accused of advancing interests of ‘foreigners’ and not those of the Kilifi people. Joho and Kingi, both of ODM, are buddies. The latter often represents the former in court. Kambi declared interest in the Kilifi governor post in February last year. He is running on Kadu-Asili, a party formed for Coast residents. Speaking yesterday at Gotani when he met elders, women and youth leaders to bolster his bid, he asked voters to reject Kingi. “Kilifi county is not a subcounty of Mombasa. We are not going to entertain leaders controlled from Mombasa,” he said. “Kingi’s masters – Raila Odinga and Joho – are not keen on addressing our plight. Raila promised Coast residents, and Muslims in particular, key appointments. But he [Raila] delivered none when he was appointed Prime Minister,” Kambi said. Kingi on his part has told voters to ignore Kambi’s ambitions as he is a non-achiever. “Some of those seeking governorship had failed to deliver when they were appointed Cabinet Secretaries,” he said.
