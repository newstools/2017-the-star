Kenyans of Asian heritage have been gazetted as the country's 44rd tribe. In notice dated July 22, President Uhuru Kenyatta termed the community an integral part of the national fabric. "All persons, bodies and authorities within the republic of Kenya shall recognise the community of Kenyans of Asian heritage as being Kenya's 44th tribe," Uhuru said. Early this year, Farah Manzoor, a human rights activist said she has been seeking the inclusivity of the Asian community as Kenyans for five years. “The people who have supported this petition with me have done it on their own individual capacities and have expressed this in the Freedom of the Right of Expression as enshrined in the Bills of Rights of our Constitution,” Farah said. She met members of the Asian communities in January to brief them about the petition. Those in the meeting were Hindus, Muslims – Sunni and Shia – Sikhs, Bohra and Goans.
