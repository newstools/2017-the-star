Business premises in Mandera have been closing early even after curfew orders were lifted on the eve of Ramadhan by the government.The county lifted the three-month curfew during the one-month Muslim fasting period between March 28 and June 28.Businesses are closing as early as 6pm. Hussein Noor, a grocer, said the closure is meant to protect customers and business owners from possible al Shabaab attacks, which are mostly carried out at night. Noor said police cannot be everywhere to protect residents, who opt to take personal measures to protect themselves.&ldquo;We are aware that our enemies strike under the cover of darkness and, therefore, we need to be at home early enough because we do not know when and where the enemy will attack,&rdquo; he said.Mandera county commissioner Fredrick Shisia reassured residents that security agents are on high alert to thwart any attacks.&ldquo;We have intensified patrols by our officers and sealed hotspots from being accessed by our enemies. This has drastically reduced attacks,&rdquo; Shisia said. He, however, urged residents to cooperate with security officers in reducing crime through sharing relevant information.Al Shabaab terrorists have killed 10 police officers in different incidents, including two civilians, by planting bombs on roads for the past one-and-a-half months.
