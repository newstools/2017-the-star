NASA co-principal Moses Wetang'ula has accused ODM Bungoma governor candidate Alfred Khang'ati of being a Jubilee project.Khang'ati is among three candidates fielded by NASA for the August 8 race.But Wetang'ula has said Khang'ati is being used by Jubilee to split the coalition's votes in favour of incumbent Kenneth Lusaka."We want to change leadership in Bungoma county, which has denied the electorate any meaningful change, yet Khang'ati is going on radio and other local media, urging residents to vote for Lusaka if not him," he said on Monday.The Senator said Lusaka has ridiculed the county both locally and internationally and should not be re-elected."We even heard US President Donald Trump, in his campaigns, talking about the rampant corruption in African governments. He mentioned a governor in Kenya who bought wheelbarrows at an exaggerated price."Read: Carry your own cross, Lusaka tells county officers over 'wheelbarrow scandal'The Ford-K leader said he has evidence that Khang'ati has secretly been meeting Lusaka and engaging in talks that led him to Ruto's home in Sugoi to take cash for his campaigns.Bungoma ODM chair Ali Machani dismissed the claims by Wetang'ula, saying the Senator is panicking that his Ford Kenyan candidate Wycliffe Wangamati is weak."For heaven's sake, Wetang'ula is like the eye of NASA and if he levels such wild accusations against Khang'ati he must be out to cause havoc," Machani told the Star on Tuesday.He said Wetang'ula should concentrate on campaigning for his own candidate and let the electorate decide."We have Ford Kenya candidates vying in Nyanza. Even here in Bungoma we have ODM candidates vying for MP and MCA seats. Does that mean they are also Jubilee projects and moles? The Senator should style up," he added.Machani, who is Bungoma minority leader, defended Khang'ati's candidature saying he is a no-nonsense person.ANC will be fielding Stephen Mutoro. But at a recent rally, NASA flag bearer Raila Odinga said they intend to pick one candidate to face off with Lusaka.More on this: NASA strategise on Bungoma votes to unseat Jubilee pointman LusakaRead: I can save county from Lusaka, says Khang&rsquo;ati
