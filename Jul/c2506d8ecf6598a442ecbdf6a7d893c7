The curtain has fallen on the country&rsquo;s oldest senator, Godfrey Gitahi Kariuki of Laikipia, popularly known as GG Kariuki.The veteran politician was elected to the first Parliament in 1963 at the age of 29.Born in December 1938 in Lariak estate, Laikipia, to Kariuki Waigwa and Wangui wa Ngummo, Kariuki was known to be a dapper and diminutive politician with a rise-and-fall fall-and-rise political career.The Laikipia senator breathed his last on Thursday night at Nairobi Hospital, aged 79. He was running for reelection as an independent candidate.Kariuki will be remembered for conducting civic education after the launch of the 2010 Constitution.He moved from village to village in the entire county educating the people on its contents.Last year, Kariuki indicated he would contest for his seat and resign midway through the term, but he was trounced during the Jubilee Party primary in April by John Kinyua.Family sources say he was admitted to the hospital last week. Kariuki was pronounced dead at 11pm on Thursday night in the presence of his family.&ldquo;Our father has been ailing for some time now and has left us. We have been at the hospital for one week and it was only yesterday that he died in our presence,&rdquo; said Peter Thomi, the Githagi MCA.Kariuki entered politics in 1959 and, together with Kinga wa Mwendwa and Mark Mwithaga, formed the Central Rift Valley Labour Party.He attended primary school in Lariak and joined Kiamwangi Secondary School in Thika, but his education was interrupted by the declaration of the State of Emergency in 1952, after which he joined the struggle for Independence.He, however, shocked the country when he attained his PhD from the University of Nairobi at the age of 76.Being the eldest in the Senate, GG was fondly referred to as Senator Number One by his colleagues.He is the fourth senator to pass on in the current Senate after Mutula Kilonzo of Makueni (April 27, 2013 ), Homa Bay&rsquo;s Otieno Kajwang&rsquo; (November 18, 2014 ) and Juma Boy of Kwale (February 12, 2017 ).After his first election in 1963 as MP for Laikipia West constituency, Kariuki served for 20 uninterrupted years before losing in the 1983 snap election.He served as minister in the Jomo Kenyatta and Daniel Moi governments for many years.From 1993-1997, Kariuki was a nominated MP. He recaptured his seat in the 2002 general election.Kariuki wrote an autobiography detailing his political career titled Illusion of Power: Fifty Years in Kenya Politics.Yesterday, Senate majority leader Kithure kindiki described GG as a man of wisdom, wit and fiercely protective of party positions in the House.&ldquo;Despite his advanced age, he would stay on into late hours, especially on days when we had Senate business where the government had a position to push through,&rdquo; the Tharaka Nithi senator said.&ldquo;He was like a father to me and one of my useful advisers.&rdquo;
