It does not matter which party one belongs to, in the end political seats are awarded by God through the will of the people, Kiambu Governor William Kabogo has said.He said he will prevail on August 8. Kabogo is running for reelection as an independent in a Jubilee stronghold. Kabogo will face Jubilee's Ferdinand Waititu. He denied ever insulting anyone, saying that is propaganda being spread by his opponenets. "I ask you, Kiambu people, to go home and pray that if Kabogo insulted anyone that God gives me a mark, which will be seen day and night," Kabogo said."Also read the Bible, Proverbs 19:5, which says that those who stand for false witness shall not go unpunished and will be punished through death."He said his components do not have an agenda for Kiambu and are only interested in power. "Do not see a rained on lion and think it is a cat. Look at the work I have done and do not listen to propaganda. There is no plan they have [but] only insults. If you want work, that is where Kabogo is," the governor said.
