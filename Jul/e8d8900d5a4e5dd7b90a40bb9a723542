Election petitions are expected to be twice the number field in 2013 but the judiciary is confident about handling them.Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu said they are expecting more than 300 petitions. Some 188 were filed on the March 4, 2013 election.Mwilu said more people are likely to turn to courts for dispute resolution, going by the nature of the contest."We are aware that the number of petitions is bound to increase. We can already read the signs from petitions filed during primaries."She said that at least 500 cases challenging the nominations were filed on the primaries that were characterised by chaos, confusion and massive irregularities.Of these, 150 cases were concluded at the High Court, nine are still pending in the Court of Appeal while one is scheduled for hearing at the Supreme Court.Mwilu said the judiciary is ready for the complaints and that enough judges have been trained on handling them.She said several magistrates have also been trained to handle petitions by MCAs.Mwilu said the judiciary will be forced to temporarily transfer judges to stations where a high number of petitions will be received."The number of judges and magistrates to handle the petition will depend on how cases are filed," she said.She addressed the media on Monday on the sidelines of the annual judges conference in Mombasa.Mwilu also said they do not expect interference from political parties but advised them to respect court rulings and judgments."Orders given by courts are final...everyone is expected to uphold them."Mwilu denied claims the courts are being used as a stumbling block to a smooth election process.The perception is that applications by the Opposition are aimed at delaying elections."Everyone has a right to be heard and granted injunctions," the DCJ stressed.
