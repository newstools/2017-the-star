Education CS Fred Matiang’i has expressed concern over the high levels of corruption and interference in management of universities. He said there have been reports of corruption, ineptitude, nepotism, financial impropriety and the trend must end. Matiang’i told university administrators to make prudent decisions to return  university education to its former glory. “The education sector has been severely compromised by corrupting the examination systems, hence giving distorted examination results,” he said. “Universities went out of their way to create campuses to absorb the abnormally high number of qualified students.”
