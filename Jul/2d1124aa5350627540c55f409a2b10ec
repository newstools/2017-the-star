A Nakuru court has reinstated 87 pyrethrum factory workers who were suspended by the company, following a demonstration over delay in implementing their CBA. Justice Stephen Radido in his ruling said their suspension was illegal and ordered that the claimants be paid their May salaries with deductions of the seven days that they did not work. He further ordered the complainants and the company to go before the county Labour office and negotiate, and also explore an out-of-court settlement. The workers moved to court seeking to revoke suspension letters issued to them on May 25, and to stop the company from locking them out. They accused the company of planning to terminate their employment and urged the court to intervene. They claimed the Shop Stewards of Kenya Chemical Workers Union Nakuru branch tried to intervene but was unsuccessful, as they were still blocked from entering company premises. The workers were suspended over alleged disturbance of operations, following a peaceful demonstration they staged on May 23 against the delay of the implementation of a 2014 collective bargaining agreement. They claimed they had sought audience with the company management to discuss a draft proposal of the CBA, as the current one is set to expire in August. But the management, through a mediator from the Ministry of Agriculture, threatened them. The companyâ€™s lawyer had applied to the court to dismiss the suit, terming it mere allegations. The case will be mentioned on September 10 for further directions.
