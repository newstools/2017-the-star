President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto yesterday urged Kenyans to reject NASA presidential flagbearer Raila Odinga because he lives on rhetoric. The leaders said Raila is busy rubbishing their administration instead of selling an agenda which will guarantee his election next month. UhuRuto spoke yesterday at Nyansiongo, Borabu constituency, Nyamira county. The head of state urged Nyamira residents to vote in Jubilee based on their track record in the last four years. “The Jubilee administration has done a lot in the four years since we took power, and that is why we are urging you to reelect us to complete the journey we started in 2013,” the President told hundreds of residents who turned up. Uhuru also accused Raila of interfering with acting Interior CS Fred Matiang’i’s work. “We are telling Odinga to compete with me and my deputy instead of attacking Matiang’i for discharging his duties. He should compete with us in politics,” Uhuru said. He questioned why Raila dislikes Matiang’i and yet when he goes to seek votes in Kisii region he says he is at home. Matiang’i, Jubilee’s Nyamira governor candidate Walter Nyambati, senator aspirant Joseph Kiangoi and other candidates were present. Uhuru said his government has allocated Sh800 million for Nyamira county in the last four years for health services. He said no government has ever provided free maternity since the country attained Independence in 1963. Ruto said NASA has been trying to stop the election but the courts have scuttled their plans. Matiang’i said he will not be intimidated and will serve Kenyans to the best of his ability.
