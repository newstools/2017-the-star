A Jubilee candidate in Kitui has donated food to keep boarding units in two public schools open after they ran out of supplies. Moses Banda (in red cap), who is running for Kitui Central MP, donated four bags of maize and two of beans to each school. He delivered the food to Kitimui Primary School, Ivaini location, on Friday. Kavisi Primary School in the outskirts of Kitui town received its donation on Saturday. Banda said he responded to the schools’ appeal for help. While visiting the schools, Banda blamed dismal performance by pupils in most Kitui schools on food insecurity. He said hunger causes high dropout rates. “It is time the government mainstreams in its policy a permanent school feeding programme to save pupils from the pangs of hunger. Hunger prevents learners from concentrating on their studies leading to poor examination results,” he said. Banda said it is everyone’s responsibility to help students improve their academic performance to enable them to become useful citizens. “Other well-wishers should also chip in keep children is school,” he said.
