Rapper Khaligraph Jones has shut down rumours that he is allowing event organisers and advertisers to underpay him. Word on the street had it the rapper is undercutting local celebrities by accepting a lower pay. Talking exclusively to Word Is, the Mazishi singer said he cannot ruin a market he has worked for. ''I'm an A-list artiste, a lot of people look up to me, so I'm not going to accept peanuts just because it's quick money to get. There are upcoming artistes who also want to make money, so if I end up taking peanuts, what will they be paid?" He termed the claims as non-credible news, saying he hasn't allowed anybody to know any of his moves. "I do my things secretly. Nobody knows where I live or what my next step is. I'm not all over. You can't see me in clubs drinking. Whoever said that, instead of yapping that nonsense, you should be out in the studio men." Asked about his trendy relationship with fellow rapper Cashy, whom he released the collabo Micasa Sucasa with, he said, "She is my girl. Period. I was raised in a family where we value family. I'm not one of these local superstars tapping a lot of hoes out here from everywhere. If I commit to one girl, that is the girl I'm going to roll with. You won't see Khaligraph was with multiple partners. If it is a girl I like, I will protect her from bullshit. That's why after our collabo, you've not seen her. She does what I tell her to do." Talking about his ideal woman, the Gaza hitmaker said, "The girl has to be disciplined. Has to have a nice body. Sipendi mtu kimbelembele. Has to be understanding." The low-pay rumours are the latest scandal to concern Papa Jones. In the last few months, he has been making headlines with his controversial publicity stunts. He first pretended to have bleached his skin then slept on a casket during his new video, drawing mixed reactions.
