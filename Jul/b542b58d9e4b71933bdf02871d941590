A man who caused a stir at the funeral of the late Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery on Saturday is still under investigation. The man was arrested after he attempted to open the late CS's casket and handed over to DCI officers for interrogation. Kajiado County Commissioner Harsama Kello told the Star on Sunday the man 'could be mentally unsound'. "Latest reports I am getting from DCI indicate the suspect is not in his right senses," Kello said. He said the police are still holding the suspect in an undisclosed place as they try to reach out to people who know him. His action is being treated as a breach of President Uhuru Kenyatta's security. None of the president's security men noticed him moving towards the casket. It was not immediately known whether the man, Antony Njuguna, traveled from outside Bisil to the burial. Njuguna shouted proclaiming that he had been sent to 'resurrect' Nkaissery. Moments later, another man caused a scare outside the main tent when he attempted to reach out to Uhuru with a note asking him for a job. The president had walked out to make a phone call at a VIP tent adjacent to the main arena when the man timed him. As he was walking back to the main tent, the man sped off to meet but he was arrested before he could reach Uhuru. He was interrogated and released after he claimed he had met the president when the head of state visited Kitengela and had been asked to hand over his telephone details. When Star caught up with the man after he had been released, he said he desperately needs a job and that the President had promised he would 'do something'. "I have been monitoring the president's movements until he came out and I told myself, this is the right time." "I did not care what the police could do to me because I had earlier talked to our president and he had promised to get me a job," George Kinyaga said.
