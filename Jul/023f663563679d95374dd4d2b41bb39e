They told me, &lsquo;Excuse me, Lady.&rsquo; I stopped, but they took out a knife and ordered me to hand over my handbag, ransacked it and stole money, mobile phone, sweets and a necklace,&rdquo; Miriam Waceke said.It was 8pm late last month. Waceke, who has moved out of her rented house, says she was ordered to pick her bag and go home quietly.family tiesShe reported the theft to the police but was told these cases are normal but residents do not report them for fear of families becoming enemies.A resident, who didn&rsquo;t want to be named, said the criminals are from seven extended families that have dominated the area.
