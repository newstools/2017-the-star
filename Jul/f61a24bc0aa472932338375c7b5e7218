Jubilee Party secretary general Raphael Tuju has asked Luos to prepare for any eventuality in the August 8 presidential election.&ldquo;You should be prepared to absorb the shock that comes with President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s defeat against your son [Raila],&rdquo;he said on Saturday.He spoke at burial of David Odongo, the brother of former Kenya Pipeline MD George Okungu, in Arram village, Rarieda constituency.Tuju said Jubilee enjoys unwavering support across the country, while Raila only fantasises about his Luo stronghold.&ldquo;He is like a fish swimming in a pond not knowing that there is an ocean as well,&rdquo; he said. Tuju said he is confident Uhuru will win.The former Cabinet minister urged the community not to burn bridges with the Jubilee government as they might end up seeking solace from it in the future.Tuju was accompanied by Hudson Aluvanje, Jubilee regional director presidential campaign in Western, and Steve Mwanga.He asked the Luos not to be myopic politically as this has dragged them into oblivion as other regions enjoy the national cake."It is fine if Raila wins the presidency, what about if Uhuru defeats him, what will you people do?" Tuju asked.He said he is a living testimony of a Luo leader who has benefited from successive regimes because of his progressive politics devoid of fights with the sitting government.He cited his lucrative job as adviser to retired President Mwai Kibaki and now as secretary general of Uhuru's Jubilee Party."Luos need to be like a giraffe. They need to look beyond the August 8 election because life must go on," Tuju said.He added that he is not prepared to join the "dirty" Luo Nyanza politics of division.
