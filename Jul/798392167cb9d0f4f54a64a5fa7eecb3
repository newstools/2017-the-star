ODM Kisumu governor candidate Anyang Nyong&rsquo;o will focus on job creation by developing the agriculture, industry and the service sectors.He launched his manifesto last Friday and outlined a 10-point agenda to turn around the county's economy.Nyong&rsquo;o said Kisumu has great potential but is an underachiever. &ldquo;Though strategically located on the shores of Lake Victoria with the ability to reach over 350 million people in East and Central Africa, it bears the marks of Kenya&rsquo;s worst set of health indicators and one of the nation&rsquo;s highest poverty level," he said.
