The late CS Joseph Nkaissery’s family and elders have ruled out involvement of his Seuri age-set in his burial on Saturday. Elder and former Assistant Minister David Sankori said on Friday the church will run the entire programme. He said the decision was made by the family, local elders and the church to give the departed Maasai hero a Christian send-off. Under the Maasai customs, fallen heroes are escorted to the grave by age mates. This was followed in the burials of William Ntimama and John Keen. But Sankori said Nkaissery’s family is active in the church and it is right that he be buried in Christian tradition. He will be interred in the land to the rar of the main house, not in front as the burial committee earlier had decided. Kajiado county commissioner Harsama Kello on Friday said preparation of the grave is “almost complete”. According to Sankori, prayers will be held outside the compound to accommodate tents with a sitting capacity of 5,000 people. Family spokesman Saitoti Maika said Nkaissery has about 800 relatives in Matapato, Kajiado. Only a few dignitaries and close relatives will later proceed to the compound. The road to the home had been graveled by Thursday evening.
