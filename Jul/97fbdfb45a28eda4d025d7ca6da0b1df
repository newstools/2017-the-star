The Boni minority community in Lamu has told Coast regional coordinator Nelson Marwa to keep off of their forest.Reports indicate security forces in Operation Linda Boni have been unable to reach parts inhabited by al Shabaab terrorists.Locals says the hideouts are much deeper in the forest but Marwa threatened to bomb it to flush out the militants.&ldquo;In the next few days, you will be seeing fireworks from Boni Forest. We need to bomb that forest completely,&rdquo; he said on a tour of Likoni last Thursday.Read: Marwa threatens to bomb Boni Forest, says ready to die in war on al ShabaabBut the community has told the regional coordinator to stay away if he cannot think of other ways to flush out the al Qaeda-linked militants.Elders led by Doza Dizo said bombing the forest is not the best to deal with the militants.Dizo also noted the community has not enjoyed peace since the operation was launched in 2015.&ldquo;He shouldn&rsquo;t even think about it. They can't bomb the forest. They should think about us first. And even then, is that the only way? As a community we believe there are many other ways to tackle this. For instance, KDF should work with youths here who know the forest really well. But they don&rsquo;t want to," he said on Saturday."There are shrines and graves of our forefathers inside that forest...that's where we get our food...it is basically our lifeline."The forest is revered by the Aweer community since it is the main source of food for locals who are hunters and gatherers.Residents have turned to subsistence farming as the security operations have hindered their movement.The shrines, where sacrifices are offered, have been in existence for decades. The community feels bombing the forest will leave them without a place of worship and anger their gods.The elders added that the people are willing to have their best men recruited as Kenya Police Reservists, to work with other agents to secure the area.They asked the government to consider this option to make their operation successful.
