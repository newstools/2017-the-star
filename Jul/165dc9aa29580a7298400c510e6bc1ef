Realistic sex robots will bring about a social and technological revolution in Britain, experts predict.While it might seem like science fiction, the machines are becoming increasingly sophisticated &ndash; and over the next ten years realistic sex androids will become more common, scientists say.But politicians and the public need to understand and deal with the ethical issues that sex robots will pose to society and relationships.This was the warning from Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of artificial intelligence and robotics at the University of Sheffield, and Dr Aimee van Wynsberghe, assistant professor in ethics and technology at the Technical University of Delft in the Netherlands, as they launched a report on the issue yesterday.Supporters of the use of sex robots say they could be useful for lonely people or those unable to form relationships.But on Tuesday, scientists sounded grim predictions about the "dark side" of the advancing technology, that could mean grappling with issues such as rape and paedophilia.There are around five makers of sex robots worldwide, with prices ranging from around &pound;4,000 to more than &pound;11,600 for a 'deluxe' model.But while they are becoming ever more realistic, scientists say it could be 50 years before robots are able to move and talk spontaneously like a partner and have facial expressions that look truly human.However, the market for them is there &ndash; the report said research shows that men are more willing to have sex with a robot than women are. One US survey of 100 people that found two-thirds of males aged 20-61 would have sex with a robot, compared with a third of women.But the report also warns that many believe the use of such technology could lead to "social isolation".Some psychologists suggest that sexual relations with robots will "desensitise humans to intimacy and empathy".Some of the sex dolls already on sale come with 'compliant' personalities, that run the risk of encouraging rape. Disturbingly, child sex dolls can be bought in Japan.Dr Sharkey, who is a co-director of the Foundation for Responsible Robotics with Dr van Wynsberghe, said: "There's a robotics revolution in all fields &ndash; service, agriculture, flying and sex. They are all part and parcel of the same thing."
