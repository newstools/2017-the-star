Jubilee supporters in Western have said they are in the party to change leadership. Water and Irrigation CS Eugene Wamalwa (pictured) and LPK’s Ababu Namwamba said they have no apologies or explanations to make for supporting Jubilee. The August 8 election will be a choice between the future and the past, they say. “This election is not just about Raila Odinga and Uhuru Kenyatta or NASA and Jubilee, but the future of the Luhya nation,” Wamalwa said. He criticised Raila for misusing leaders from the community for personal gain.Namwamba said it is time for real transformation for the people and the region. “Where Eugene and I are is where the future of this region is. That other option being dangled represents unfulfilled promises, journeys that can never be, being used and even being sold,” Namwamba said. The Budalang’i MP said NASA supporters should continue walking the “dead journey” and leave those supporting and working with the government to walk the journey of hope.
