It's no secret that our lives have become more sedentary than our stone age ancestors. Exercise improves brain health, inducing the development of new brain cells, but the link between exercise and our brain's extends far back in history. New research suggests that the link between exercise and the brain is a product of our evolutionary history and our past as hunter-gatherers, and the same parts of the brain that are taxed during complex tasks such as foraging also benefit from exercise.Two University of Arizona researchers who run a research program on exercise and the brain have developed an 'adaptive capacity model' for understanding, from an evolutionary neuroscience perspective, how physical activity impacts brain structure and function. The researchers argue that as humans transitioned from a sedentary, apelike existence to a more physically demanding, hunter-gatherer lifestyle about two million years ago, we started carrying out foraging tasks, which may explain the connection between the brain and physical activity."We think our physiology evolved to respond to those increases in physical activity levels, and those physiological adaptations go from your bones and your muscles, apparently all the way to your brain," said Dr David Raichlen, an associate professor at the University of Arizona's School of Anthropology and a co-author of the study. "It's very odd to think that moving your body should affect your brain in this way &mdash; that exercise should have some beneficial impact on brain structure and function &mdash; but if you start thinking about it from an evolutionary perspective, you can start to piece together why that system would adaptively respond to exercise challenges and stresses," he said. The researchers found that the parts of the brain that are most taxed during complex activities, such as foraging, are areas that play a key role in memory and functions such as problem solving and planning, and these are the same brain areas that benefits from exercise. "Foraging is an incredibly complex cognitive behavior," Dr Raichlen said. "You're moving on a landscape, you're using memory not only to know where to go but also to navigate your way back, you're paying attention to your surroundings."You're multitasking the entire time because you're making decisions while you're paying attention to the environment, while you are also monitoring your motor systems over complex terrain. "Putting all that together creates a very complex multitasking effort."'BRAINS ADAPT TO STRESSES'The model that the researchers put together could also help explain findings such as the ones they published last year that found that runners' brains appear to be more connected than those of non-runners. It could also help researchers come up with ways to enhance the benefits of exercise even more, as well as develop exercise interventions for age-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's."What we're proposing is, if you're not sufficiently engaged in this kind of cognitively challenging aerobic activity, then this may be responsible for what we often see as healthy brain aging, where people start to show some diminished cognitive abilities," said Dr Gene Alexander, a UA professor of psychology, psychiatry, neuroscience and physiological sciences and the co-author of the study."So the natural aging process might really be part of a reduced capacity in response to not being engaged enough."Reduced capacity is what can happen to organs in the body when they're not exercised enough. Dr Raichlen explained our organs adapt to the stresses they undergo. "For example, if you engage in exercise, your cardiovascular system has to adapt to expand capacity, be it through enlarging your heart or increasing your vasculature, and that takes energy," Dr Raichlen said. "So if you're not challenging it in that way &mdash; if you're not engaging in aerobic exercise &mdash; to save energy, your body simply reduces that capacity."The same thing can happen to the brain - if it's not being stressed enough, it can atrophy - when neurons and the connections between them are lost. "Our evolutionary history suggests that we are, fundamentally, cognitively engaged endurance athletes, and that if we don't remain active we're going to have this loss of capacity in response to that," said Dr Alexander, who studies brain aging and Alzheimer's disease."So there really may be a mismatch between our relatively sedentary lifestyles of today and how we evolved."Dr Alexander and Dr Raichlen say future research should look at how different levels of exercise intensity and different types of exercise, or even exercise paired with cognitive tasks, affect the brain.Dr Raichlen suggests that exercising in a new environment can pose new mental challenges, and this could be beneficial to the brain. "Most of the research in this area puts people in a cognitively impoverished environment," Dr Raichlen said. "They put people in a lab and have them run on a treadmill or exercise bike, and you don't really have to do as much, so it's possible that we're missing something by not increasing novelty."
