Jubilee's interim Mombasa chairman has denied giving President Uhuru Kenyatta a 72-hour ultimatum for talks with Coast leaders.Matano Chengo claimed he was misquoted and that this was a case of "serious miscommunication" as he is "too small" a man to threaten the President.More on this: Frustrated Coast Jubilee leaders demand meeting with Uhuru in 72 hoursAlso read: Jubilee women move to cool tempers after Chengo gives Uhuru 72-hour ultimatumChengo said all he and other Jubilee chairmen from the six Coast counties want is for Uhuru to listen to them.He said if 72 hours end without a word from him, the group will travel to Nairobi to "beg" him to listen to their concerns.The chairman said they want to tell their leader there are no grassroots campaigns at the Coast like he and DP William Ruto have been told due to interference by "brokers".&ldquo;Our concern is that nothing is happening on the ground. Let Uhuru not be cheated that campaigns going on. This is something all the six chairmen noticed and raised."Chengo said they will also tell Uhuru they have been locked out of Jubilee Party affairs and that candidates at the Coast are only interested in money, not victory.&ldquo;When these aspirants go to Nairobi, all they request is money,&rdquo; he told The Star by phone on Monday.On Saturday, Chengo was reported as saying the meeting with the head of state was being demanded, not requested. Feedback from the President is expected by 1pm on Tuesday. Without it they may withdraw their support.Chengo noted that with 35 days to the election, not much will be accomplished in terms of gaining support.Their biggest fear, he said, is for Jubilee to lose seats under his watch because of constraints placed by people unaware of the Coast political terrain.The Star has reliably been informed that Nominated Senator Beth Mugo may have triggered the harsh statement issued by Chengo.Jubilee lobby groups in the county were once locked out of a party meeting held in Nyali, at undisclosed date and chaired by Mugo. Mugo has been spending quite sometime in Mombasa campaigning for Uhuru. She has organised numerous meetings, some that go on after midnight, with the aim of ensuring Uhuru rules for another five years.The legislator is said to have taken the lead role in campaigns, angering some of the officials who wanted to be point men in the region.These officials feel they are the masters of politics in this NASA bastion. Sources within the party said they are often left out of the meetings.On Sunday, Chengo was given 24 hours to retract his statement or resign. He and his team were branded "moles, spoilers and self-seekers" by Abdisalam Kassim, a member of the presidential campaign team, and former mayor and Council of Elders national coordinator Rajab Sumba.There are fears Chengo will physically be kicked out of office if he does not apologise or leave voluntarily. He could also be locked out of the Nyali office which is Jubilee's Coast headquarters.Mombasa governor candidate Suleiman Shahbal defended Chengo saying he was probably misquoted."If it is true he actually gave an ultimatum, then that is disrespectful to the President,&rdquo; he said on phone, but added that those calling for his removal from office are overreacting.Chengo said he will not heed calls from "political reject" Kassim to resign.Kassim dropped his senator bid to support Hazel Katana.
