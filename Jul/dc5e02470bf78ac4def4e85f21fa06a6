Small-scale tea farmers have been encouraged to seek state help to trade their wares in the export market for higher returns. In a new partnership between the Export Promotion Council and Tea Directorate, the tea industry is looking to include SMEs in the export market to double exports of the beverage. In the agreement, EPC will provide SMEs with information on international markets, knowledge to get leverage in new markets and how to use the National Single Window System, to improve the export experience. The agreement came a week after EPC trained Eldoret regional exporters in production position and export procedures for regional and international markets. In the agreement, budding exporters are expected to identify opportunities in the export market to significantly contribute towards diversification and expansion of the exports basket of goods and services and mitigate against declining export volumes. “Export Promotion Council is committed to strengthening partnership with the business community and other key stakeholders, particularly county governments in driving the export agenda through creating attractive environments for export business in the counties,” said chief executive Peter Biwott in a statement.
