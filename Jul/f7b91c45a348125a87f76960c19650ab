United for Kiambu leaders have promised to get rid of unfriendly business policies - in a bid to attract investors - should they clinch power on  August 8. The team, lead by JP governor candidate Ferdinand Waititu, James Nyoro, David Ngari, popularly known as Gakuyo, John Mugwe and Aquiline Njoki, said Kiambu is lagging behind in development because of poor business policies legislated by incumbent governor William Kabogo. Speaking in Thika after a meeting with investors on Wednesday evening, Waititu said his government would be accommodating. He said unemployment is a big problem in Kiambu. “We will work with MCAs to ensure a common front and do away with inauspicious business policies that Kabogo enacted,” Waititu said.
