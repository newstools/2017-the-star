A West Pokot woman reportedly resurrected two hours after her husband received a three-word "miracle text"&nbsp;from self-proclaimed prophet David Owuor.Rosa&nbsp;Rotirakori from Cheparten village,&nbsp;South Pokot sub-county,&nbsp;is said to have collapsed and died on Wednesday night after being ill for about a month.The death was only confirmed by her husband and daughter.&nbsp;The village is in a remote area with poor road networks so the body was to be taken to the morgue the next day.Thousands of believers&nbsp;from the Ministry of&nbsp;Repentance and Holiness, which is led by Owuor, thronged the remote village to witness the miracle."More than 300 cars arrived. Schools were closed and every activity stopped as people travelled to witness the miracle," a resident said.Rosa's husband&nbsp;Samson Rotirakori said she fell ill that night."She became very weak. By midnight, her condition had worsened...she was unable to walk and experienced difficulties breathing."Samson narrated that he then called a senior pastor from the ministry who asked him to send the prophet a prayer."Immediately after the phone call, Rosa stopped breathing and stretched out her hands and legs," he said.&ldquo;My wife urinated before her last breath. I then covered her with a blanket. My daughter&nbsp;Levine&nbsp;Chesang&nbsp;was beside&nbsp;her. Her body was cold and&nbsp;stiff and her heart had stopped&nbsp;beating."Chesang said she screamed immediately after her mother died,&nbsp;alerting their neighbour.Her father said his wife remained dead for about&nbsp;two hours and that it took the powers of prophet for her to return to life.Samson said&nbsp;at about 51 minutes past midnight, he received an SMS from Owuor saying: "It is well".Two hours later, he said, Rosa began&nbsp;coughing and sneezing."She came back to life and asked everyone twice: &lsquo;who has brought me back?'," he said.He held a thanksgiving ceremony that&nbsp;senior bishops in the ministry attended.Zachary Kasepoi, a senior deputy director of medical services, did not examine the body but said this must have been a case of divine resurrection.He was not around when the woman died and is a member of the prophet's ministry.&ldquo;There is no a machine in the world that can jump-start lungs. This is a mighty miracle. I was born and educated here but this is a miracle and it should be&nbsp;believed,&rdquo; he said.West Pokot medical superintendent Jonathan Mukhola said it is impossible for a person to return to life more than five minutes after being confirmed dead."The brain stops to function. I could not ascertain that she really died since no medial officer examined the body. I also don't know what she was suffering from."Mukhola said the woman may have fallen into a coma."I have not seen a medical report. I can't confirm anything," he said, adding he was surprised that a medic believed the woman resurrected."Maybe he doesn't believe in the medicine any more."Archbishop John Litunda said Kenyans should expect more miracles to happen through the "mightiest Prophet Owuor'.&ldquo;Two police officers have repented and joined the ministry because they believe in the prophet's miracles. Kenyans should pray for a peaceful election and police officers should trust God for a peaceful nation."Speaking to The Star after the ceremony, Rosa said she died and came back to life, and urged&nbsp;Kenyans to repent."I was to be buried today but I thank my prophet for bringing me back to life. I did not speak Kiswahili but after resurrecting, I can now address the media in Kiswahili,&rdquo; she said.The prophet causes a stir everywhere he goes, with his followers cleaning roads with soap and making other outrageous preparations for his arrival.More on this:&nbsp;1,200 police to guard Prophet Owuor Kisumu rallyAlso read:&nbsp;Pastor sets himself on fire after missing spot in Prophet Owuor's Kisumu convoy
