The Lang&rsquo;ata Hospital management has denied claims it detained a pregnant woman treated at the facility on June 27. Anastasia Muthoni had said she was detained at the hospital for failing to clear her Sh12,000 bill. But the director, only identified as Dr Matharu, termed the allegation malicious. He said Muthoni was taken to the hospital by the Lang&rsquo;ata police station commander after she fainted at the station. She had recorded a statement there saying she had been assaulted by her policeman housband. &ldquo;We did everything to make sure there was nothing wrong with the baby. An ultrasound scan was done and the baby and the mother were fine. Because she had fainted, we put her in our observation ward and she was to be collected after six hours. She was not locked up in any room. We don&rsquo;t have a room where we lock up people anyway &mdash; this is a hospital,&rdquo; Matharu said.
