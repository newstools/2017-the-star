Garissa Governor Nathif Jama&rsquo;s supporters (pictured) yesterday took to the streets to protest over what they termed his continual harassment by the EACC.The protesters, who brought business in the town to a standstill, marched in the streets carrying placards and headed to the EACC offices. They took issue with the story that has made headlines in the last three days which stated his account had Sh5.3 billion and was frozen by a court in Nairobi. Jama has denied owning an account with such amount.Last week, a bank statement purporting to be that of Jama did the rounds on social media. The eight-page statement had the three official names of the Garissa governor. A story in a local daily read, &lsquo;The High Court on Friday froze the governor&rsquo;s account to allow the EACC to scrutinise transactions amounting to Sh 5.3 billion over the last four years&rsquo;.
