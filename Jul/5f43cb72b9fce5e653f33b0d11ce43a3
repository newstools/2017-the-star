A Class seven boy from Baringo North was on Saturday afternoon shot dead by suspected Pokot bandits a day before President Uhuru Kenyatta's tour to the sub-County. Chelang’a Chebor,17, from Boyuro Primary School, was shot while herding his family cattle at Chepkesin. Kissumet Sub-location Assistant Chief Joshua Kiptosok said the boy was in the accompany of five others. "There was a fierce exchange of fire among the bandits, Police and Kenya Police Reservist before overpowering the (officers). They made away with over 50 head of cattle," said Keitany This is the same area where a chief was shot dead in February during Deputy President William Ruto's visit. In the afternoon, the President will address residents at Kabartonjo town and later hold the main rally in Kabarnet grounds.

Chemoe resident Richard Chepchomei said over 2,000 residents who had resettled at Chepkesin, Chemoe and Kapturo volatile areas have again fled the area following the attack. Over 10 primary schools also remain closed, others partially open over serial attacks by armed Pokot bandits. During his tour last week Rift Valley Regional coordinator Wanyama Musiambo disputed claims of ongoing bandits attacks saying security has been restored in the county. "We have even deployed at least five KPR officers to man every school so teachers should have no cause to worry of their lives" said Musiambo. Chepchomei said, “I squarely blame the runaway insecurity to the laxity of the Rift valley Regional administration because how come raids are being made constantly without any arrest or sacking of chiefs”. However he urged the police officers and the Kenya Defense Forces (KDF) in-charge of security operations in the area to tighten barriers and security operations along the porous borders of Baringo North, South and Tiaty Sub-counties.
