Fifteen foreigners will be charged in Kisumu with being in the country illegally and operating businesses without permits.They were arrested in the town's CBD on Thursday by district officers who were tipped off by local traders.Evelyn Cherobel, principal immigration officer, said the immigrants are from Burundi, Congo, Uganda and Rwanda."They were arrested while hawking shows and jewellery without permits," she told The Star on Thursday.She said they did not have documents or permits allowing them to operate in the town."They also could not produce documents allowing them to be in the country."Cherobel noted more foreigners have been breaking visa regulations."We have foreigners who come into the country as visitors but end up venturing into business without following procedures," she said.The officer noted that in March, 15 Egyptians were arrested in Kisumu town with fake documents.Five were later released due to lack of evidence while the rest were set free on Sh300,000 bail each.Cherobel said her team is well-prepared to deal with such incidents especially as the general elections loom.
