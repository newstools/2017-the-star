It is regrettable that civil servants should join the
General Election campaign in such large numbers at the grassroots. CEOs, chairpersons of parastatals and board chairpersons
have retreated to the grassroots to campaign for Jubilee. They are holding meetings in their home areas to drum up
support for President Uhuruâ€™s reelection. When the framers of the Constitution of Kenya 2010 wrote the
document, they were very clear in their minds why they prescribed a council of
ministers that had only two politicos, the President and the Deputy President. The other members of the Cabinet are technocrats and where they happen to be
politicians they drop all political activity for the duration they serve as
CSs. There will be hell to pay for this breach of the
Constitution, as civil servants are enjoined to be neutral at all times. The
Civil Service of the new Constitution is for all seasons and should avoid
partisan politics like the plague. Dragooning public servants into the campaign is wrong.
