Deputy President William Ruto says the opposition NASA will not penetrate his Rift Valley turf. NASA, led by Raila Odinga, was in the region yesterday to woo voters. Ruto said the Kalenjin leaders who defected to NASA recently were duped by the unreasonable policies fronted by the opposition. He campaigned in Nandi on Tuesday. “Some of them were even excited by NASA’s promise to legalise busaa and chang’aa, but they should not gamble with their future,” Ruto said. Chesumei MP Elijah Lagat and seven former MPs, mostly from Nandi (Ruto’s allies turned foes) ditched Jubilee and are now campaigning for NASA. The former MPs include David Koech, David Sudi, Francis Mutwol, Jesse Maisz, John Cheruiyot, Joseph Misoi and Stephen Tarus. They were joined by Maj (Rtd) Augustine Cheruiyot. The defectors have vowed to ensure Raila wins on August 8. But speaking in Kombe, Chesumei, Ruto mocked them, saying “...these people in NASA have said they will legalise chang’aa and busaa, and that is what might have attracted some to join them.”  Losing his grip? The DP campaigned for Jubilee candidates, including Stephen Sang (governor), Samson Cherargei (senator) and Tecla Sum (woman rep). Ruto pleaded with residents not to elect independent candidates, who are causing nightmares for Jubilee candidates. He said those who defected to NASA will have no impact in Nandi, which is a Jubilee stronghold. Ruto is fighting to keep a tight grip on his turf, where independent candidates and those from other parties seem headed for wins on August 8, weakening Jubilee’s hold. In Ruto’s home constituency of Turbo, Jubilee candidate Kevin Okwara is fighting against strong independent candidate Janet Rotich. Okwara, a non-Kalenjin, won the Jubilee primary, causing 14 losers from the Kalenjin community to gang up against him. Ruto has urged residents to vote six-piece for Jubilee. Analysts say, however, voters may be more interested in individual candidates, regardless of their parties.
