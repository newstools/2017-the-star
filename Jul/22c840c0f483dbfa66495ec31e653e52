The curtain fell on the life of pioneer banker and doyen of the cooperatives sector Jason Kiamba Kimbui, when he answered the trumpet call on June 11.Born in 1932, he attended Uringu and Kaaga primary schools in Meru county. A man of many firsts, he was the pioneer student from the then Tigania and Igembe districts to join Alliance High School in 1951. He later proceeded to the prestigious Aberdeen University in Scotland, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in agriculture.A visionary man and keen believer in women&rsquo;s empowerment, he personally sponsored his wife Lois Nyeera to Aberdeen University, where she graduated from the School of Home Economics, making them the first graduates from Tigania-Igembe.They were blessed with six children &mdash; Daudi Mwenda, Dennis Kinoti, Harry Kanyili, Douglas Gituma, Pamela Karambu and Nina Kangai. Prior to his graduation he was headhunted by the giant Meru African Coffee Cooperative Union as general manager (designate) to replace his close friend and mentor Henry Kinyua, who had resigned and had been appointed CEO of Kenya Planters&rsquo; Cooperative Union in Nairobi.At MACCU he initiated the design and construction of the impressive MACCU building, an enduring landmark in Meru town, after deducting coffee farmers a mere one cent per kilo of coffee.He was instrumental in setting up the dairy and maize milling plant(s), making MACCU the wealthiest cooperative union at the time of his retirement in 1968.President Mzee Jomo Kenyatta, who had officially opened the MACCU building, was so impressed by Kimbui&rsquo;s managerial skills that he proposed him to head the newly created Cooperative Bank of Kenya Ltd. Armed with a nominal capital of Sh250,000, Kimbui, an Asian gentleman called Yadav as chief accountant and an office messenger named Nzuki proceeded to build the mighty empire now currently known as the Cooperative Bank of Kenya Ltd.It was nothing short of magical as Kimbui, the first Kenyan to head a bank in this country, spurred it to dizzying heights. As if that was not enough, they also created CIC Insurance Ltd as their Insurance wing.The highlight of Kimbui&rsquo;s career came with the design, construction and completion of the aesthetically beautiful Cooperative Bank House on land donated courtesy of President Mzee Jomo Kenyatta.Sadly, Mzee Kenyatta did not live to see its completion and it was officially opened by President Daniel Moi. As a testimony to its impeccable design and construction, Cooperative Bank House withstood the 1998 bomb blast that destroyed the American Embassy. The neighbouring Ufundi Cooperative House was reduced to a pile of rubble.After the 1982 coup attempt, Kimbui and his close friend Henry Kinyua, then also directors of KPCU and the Coffee Board, ran into severe headwinds with the government.A new Commissioner of Cooperatives had been appointed with specific instructions to rearrange and destabilise the cooperatives sector, targetting specific individuals said to be earning salaries higher than that of the President. As a consequence, the salaries of Kinyua and Kimbui became the subject of debate in Parliament.Both men resented this state of affairs and told the commissioner to his face to immediately desist from interfering with a functional and operational sector. Unbeknown to them, the commissioner had direct instructions from the highest office in the land to oust them.It only dawned on them after several tiffs with the Office of the President, making them the first Kenyans to resist machinations and schemes from that quarter.Eventually, the government succeeded in ousting them by lowering the national retirement age. Kimbui retired to manage his extensive interests in agriculture, real estate and the service industry, including the Growers&rsquo; Caf&eacute; group. Fare thee well, Papa.
