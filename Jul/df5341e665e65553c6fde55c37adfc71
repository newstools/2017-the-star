The National Cereals and Produce Board Ol kalou deport has stopped selling the government&rsquo;s subsidised maize to residents so it can have enough to supply to schools in Nyandarua county.The residents, who go through the chiefs and assistant county commissioners&rsquo; offices to apply, are getting a rude shock when they present their approved applications to the deport but are not allowed to purchase it.Joseph Langat, the Ol kalou deport manager, said 25 schools have benefited and more than 50 schools are expected to get the maize.&ldquo;The school heads requested that we first feed the schools since the supply is low. When the supply increases, the residents too will get [some],&rdquo; he said.Residents said, however, that the programme may be abused by some enterprising school head teachers.&ldquo;Some school heads may buy the maize in bulk only to sell later given the high cost of maize in Nyandarua,&rdquo; resident Richard Mbogo said.In Ol kalou, a 90kg bag of maize is retailing at between Sh4,300 and Sh4,500, while the government subsidised maize, which is bought from Ethiopia, is retailing at Sh2,560 for a 100kg bag, Sh2,300 for a 90kg bag and Sh1,280 for a 50kg bag.Langat said it would be difficult for school heads to sell the commodity as they are applying to purchase the maize through the Ministry of Education, which must confirm the authenticity of their feeding programme.Both public and private institutions are allowed to buy maize from the deport.Many residents of Nyandarua, especially Ndaragwa, are facing severe food shortage.
