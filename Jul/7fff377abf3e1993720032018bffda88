With about a month remaining to the general election, many aspirants are gearing up for various seats, and Kenyan musicians have not been left behind. After Ben Githae (Tano Tena) and Amos Barasa (Bindu Bichenjanga), another artiste, Samuel Kaizuka, aka Kashule, has released a song on flashy Makadara MP aspirant Robert Momanyi."I'm a resident of Makadara and to us youths, all we need is change," Kashule said. "Momanyi has proved to be a leader we want and his support for women and youth in Makadara can be evident across the constituency. I was impressed by his manifesto, and he has been there for us and he contributes a lot, especially if there are funerals. We believe in Momanyi."When asked if he is afraid of losing his friends who support other parties, Kashule said, "Most of the youths nowadays think beyond tribal borders, unlike the past. Watu wamechanuka na hawaangalii mambo ya chama. We are focused on leaders who will bing change not big names."Momanyi, who has made this song his official campaign song, has promised to support Kashule and other musicians in Makadara. "I will help release a video for this song's audio."In a recent interview with the Star, the Makadara hopeful said he will beat his competitors George Aladwa, Reuben Ndolo and Benson Mutura.
