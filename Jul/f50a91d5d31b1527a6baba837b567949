The judiciary is concerned that the election might be disrupted after the IEBC went ahead to print ballot papers, despite pending nomination appeals.The debate has featured in the ongoing Annual Judges Colloquium in Mombasa.Chief Justice David Maraga yesterday registered his disquiet.The matter has been further complicated by the fact that a pending case challenging the awarding of the printing tender to Dubai&rsquo;s Al Ghurair Printing and Publishing is yet to be determined. The ruling is set for Friday. But the printing of ballot papers is going on.Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu on Monday criticised the IEBC for going ahead with the printing.Maraga said, &ldquo;There will be a problem.&rdquo;&ldquo;We are dealing with them (appeals) as they come. Assume the IEBC has printed ballot papers with a name of a governor on it and then the [court rules that the name] should not be on the ballot paper or somebody else should be on the ballot paper. It becomes untidy to add the name of that person and all that.&rdquo;But IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati said printing is going on for elective posts where there are no disputes pending in court.&ldquo;The commission approved the ballot printing for most of the candidates, where there are no issues. There are a few cases in court and that percentage is still being worked out, because we have received some court orders, which we want to enforce so the ones that have no dispute, the printing is ongoing,&rdquo; he was quoted as saying on June 25, after guiding 850 IEBC staff through an election preparedness conference.The opposition has questioned why the IEBC was quick to print the ballot papers, despite all the confusion and legal battles.The Star reported the prominent Al Ghurair family hosted President Uhuru Kenyatta at the famous Burj Al Khalifa in Dubai before a Sh2.5 billion tender to print the ballot papers was awarded to the firm.NASA claims Uhuru influenced the tender award to the Dubai firm. Maraga denied he was referring to the Al Ghurair case when he said the Judiciary will not make a ruling that can lead to the postponement of general election.
