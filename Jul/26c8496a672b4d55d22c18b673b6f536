The High Court has ordered that a criminal case against two Western Africans charged with being in possession of fake currencies to be heard and determined within three weeks.The prosecution had earlier been granted six months to complete investigations, but when the matter came up for hearing on Friday, it said it was not ready to proceed.Justice Luka Kimaru made the orders after senior state counsel Daniel Karuri requested a further extension.Mohammed Sani, alias Dr Mustafa, from Niger and Ousman Ibrahim Bako from Cameroon have denied 12 counts and are still in custody after the High Court declined to grant bail. They are represented by lawyer Stephen Kimanthi.Sani in May shocked the court when he claimed that he and others at Industrial Area Prison hacked into Safaricom servers and stole millions of shillings.The two are said to have had American dollars and euros equivalent to Sh112 billion and to have had forgery papers on January 14 and 15 at Diamond Park II Estate, Nairobi.They were accused of having materials used in printing US dollar and euro notes.
