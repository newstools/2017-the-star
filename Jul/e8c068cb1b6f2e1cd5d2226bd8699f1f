Lack of a security code is what hindered local printer, Ramco from participating in the country&rsquo;s ballot tender deal worth Sh2.5 billion. The tender was awarded to Dubai-based Al Ghurair Printing and Publishing Company.Even so, the group&rsquo;s printing arm which boasts of a German state of art production facility in Nairobi exceeding 145,000 square metres has its eyes trained on the 2022 election printing and packaging materials, said group chief executive Amit Patel.&lsquo;&rsquo;Our printing and packaging section which commands 31 per cent of the group&rsquo;s $275 million (Sh2.75 billion) turnover has come full circle. With Barron&rsquo;s cutting edge promotional materials and our strong network in East Africa, we look forward to tapping into high level businesses that will transform branding and promotion in the continent,&rsquo;&rsquo; said chief executive Amit Patel after signing an initial Sh100 million partnership with South Africa-based promotion firm Barron.He asked the government to consider giving incentives to local printing and packaging companies, cut on importation and create employment opportunities to citizens.He asked the government to exercise caution ahead of the ban on plastics scheduled for September, saying the use of plastic materials is now part of people&rsquo;s lives, hence hasty implementation of the ban will affect jobs.&ldquo;We have already done production adjustments in support of the plastic ban. But the state must come up with an elaborate implementation strategy, considering that the ban will add cost to the end consumer-households by up to fivefold.&rsquo;&rsquo;His sentiments were echoed by the ThirdWay Alliance Presidential candidate Ekuru Aukot in a Kenya Association of Manufacturers forum held on Tuesday in a Nairobi hotel.He lamented that the country always seeks services of external printers every election year, pumping billions out of its economy for a task that can be done locally.&ldquo;We must come up with a well thought policy framework that can see those billions circulate in our economy,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Aukot.
