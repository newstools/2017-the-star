The trend by donors to move away will continue. The government need to take this seriously and set aside more resources for adolescent health,&rdquo; said Olajide.During the event, demographers and health specialists unveiled a roadmap on how best the potential of young people can be harnessed to drive the social and economic development of the country.The specialists warned that the country may lose an opportunity to tap the young people&rsquo;s potential if more resources are not invested in them and reproductive health facilities made accessible.The roadmap lays out clear strategies of how best resources can be harnessed to reap from the demographic dividend and encourage the county governments to set aside a budget line to fund reproductive health services.
