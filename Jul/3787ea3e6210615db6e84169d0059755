Kenya&rsquo;s maize harvest is expected fall by a drastic 25 per cent this year, Agriculture CS Willy Bett said yesterday.He said the expected 37 million bags of maize will be slashed, forcing imports from Uganda, Tanzania and elsewhere.&ldquo;The weather has also not been fair to us and this will result to a five per cent loss.There will be another 20 per cent from the armyworm invasion. In total, we are likely to have a 25 per cent reduction of our maize crop harvest this season,&rdquo; Bett said.Kenya produces 4.2 million tonnes per year with a consumption of four to 3.9 million bags per year.&ldquo;Climate change is real and the conditions have been conducive for infestation by some new pests,&rdquo; the CS said.He said the government has allocated Sh350 million to fight the armyworm.Bett spoke at Kilimo House when he met with his Zambian counterpart to sign a trade agreement.Agriculture PS Richard Lesiyampe said the armyworm has spread in 25 counties and affected 200,000 hectares ( 494,210 acres). Another 650,000 hectares ( 160,6184 acres) are under threat from the pest.The Food and Agriculture Organization and the African Union Commission last week agreed to collaborate on an immediate response to manage and control the fast-spreading armyworm in Africa.At a meeting held at the AU headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, FAO regional programme leader for Africa, Abebe Haile-Gabriel, said the spread of the pest in Africa is reaching an alarming proportion. It has damaged or destroyed millions of hectares of maize in many countries.&ldquo;This is causing significant crop damage, the consequences of which may potentially put the livelihoods of millions of smallholders in jeopardy, if effective and coordinated response is not mounted,&rdquo; Haile-Gabriel said.
