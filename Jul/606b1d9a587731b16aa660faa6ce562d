Learning may be disrupted across all public universities from Monday if lecturers make real their threat to go on strike.The lecturers gave the government until Friday midnight to implement the 2013-17 Collective Bargaining Agreement signed in March.Three university unions issued a joint statement warning they will withdraw services because the government has shown no indications of honouring the CBA.&ldquo;No one in government seems ready to address this plight. The government and university councils seemingly want the education sector to suffer again,&rdquo; University Academic Staff Union secretary general Constantine Wasonga said.The CBA, which expired at midnight yesterday, allocated lecturers and non-teaching staff Sh10 billion to increase their salaries and house allowances.The amount was to be shared amongst Uasu, Kenya University Staff Union, and the Kenya Union of Domestic, Hotels, Educational Institutions, Hospitals and Allied Workers (Kudheiha) to the ratio of 1:3:6.&ldquo;We call upon the government, and specifically Education CS Fred Matiang&rsquo;i, to wake up and pay this money. We are aware he is well informed,&rdquo; Kudheiha secretary general Albert Njeru said.&ldquo;If the money is not paid by midnight, the die is cast,&rdquo; Kusu secretary general Charles Mukhwaya said.The contentious CBA was signed in March by Uasu and Kudhehia, while Kusu signed in May.This was after the government offered Sh10 billion to be shared among the three unions.Uasu&rsquo;s signature brought to an end a 54-day strike that had paralysed learning across 35 public universities.Under the deal, Uasu was allocated Sh6 billion to cater for a 17.5 per cent increase on basic salary, and a 3.2 per cent raise on house allowance for its 9,000 staff.The adjustments were to benefit staff in job Grades 11 to 15.Members allied to Kusu were given Sh4 billion towards a 17.74 per cent salary hike and a 3.9 per cent increase on house allowance. Beneficiaries are staff in job Grades five to 15.Non-teaching staff under Kudhehia got Sh1 billion to increase salaries and house allowances for staff in job Grades one to four.The new scales would see the lowest paid professor currently earning Sh144,672 take home Sh244,922 inclusive of house allowance.The highest paid professor earning Sh211,753 would earn Sh324,307 inclusive of house allowance.Associate professors currently earning Sh122,956 would get Sh220,852 inclusive house allowance.Lowest paid lectures currently earning Sh83,361 would get Sh156,121 while highest paid will pocket 199,065 plus house allowance. The lowest paid senior lecturer who currently earns Sh94,215 will get Sh170,725 while the highest paid who currently earns Sh135,243 will get Sh219,390 inclusive of salary and house allowance.Lowest paid Tutorial fellows who currently earn Sh69,794 will now earn Sh136,760 while the highest paid would get Sh173,179 salary plus house allowance.Under the CBA, the above figures must be backdated to July 1, 2013 to cover the accrued amount of the adjusted pay.
