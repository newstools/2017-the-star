Churches have become favourite vote-hunting grounds for politicians running for election. One of these is Kiambu Senator Kimani Wamatangi, who on Sunday attended service at St James Cathedral, Kiambu town. The church was celebrating 100 years of existence. Wamatangi urged worshippers to reelect President Uhuru Kenyatta. He asked them to pray for peace. “As much as we are praying for peace it should start in our villages with us. Condemn all forces that can bring about a breach of peace,” Wamatangi said. The service was presided over by Anglican Archbishop Jackson Sapit and Mt Kenya South diocese Bishop Timothy Ranji. Some churches, especially in Embu, have warned leaders implicated in corrupt dealings not to bring dirty money to God’s house.
