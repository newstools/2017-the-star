More than 500 national police reservists have been deployed to beef up security in the North Rift ahead of the August 8 general election.They will assist Kenya Defense Forces, regular police and APs in maintaining peace during the electioneering period."We have tried to contain the runaway insecurity in the region. The remaining bit is ensuring peace and order," said Rift valley regional coordinator Wanyama Musiambo.He addressed the public at a peace meeting in Marigat, Baringo South sub-county, on Friday. Among those who attended the meeting were chiefs, elders and residents of areas prone to insecurity.Musiambo noted the government recruited 151 NPRs in Baringo North, 142 in Baringo South and 240 in Marakwet East and West.He said this was done after President Uhuru Kenyatta declared the areas insecure and "disturbed"."We have confirmed and absorbed the NPRs into the service," he said but declined to reveal how much they will be paid.But he added the recruits have already presented their particulars and will be taken through police training in bits.Various agencies have been carrying out operation to flash bandits out of Baringo, Elgeyo Marakwet and Laikipia counties.More than 30,000 people were displaced and are at camps in Chapin, Kapkomon, Sibilo,Kampi ya Samaki, Moinonin and Chemoe in Baringo North. Others are in Nyimbei, Mochongoi, Karne, Eldume in Marigat, Tangulbei and Kaptuiya in Tiaty sub-county.Assuring the elections will be peaceful, Musiambo urged residents to maintain calm.Kenyans have been on high alert at major political functions since the 2007/8 post-election violence that left about 1,300 dead and more than 600,000 internally displaced.Security operations in counties including Laikipia resulted in complaints about harassment by police and the killing of livestock.Devolution CS Mwangi Kiunjuri earlier said the government will compensate herders whose animals were either killed or injured during operations in Laikipia.Read: Herders to get pay for animals killed in Laikipia security operations - KiunjuriThe regional coordinator also asked teachers in affected schools to resume teaching as at least five reservists will be deployed to each one."We have assured security even in the IDP camps so teachers have no reason to fear for their lives" he said.Musiambo noted the effects of the drought but said the government has committed to providing relief food."Majority of the people in the camps go without food, water and shelter," he said.
