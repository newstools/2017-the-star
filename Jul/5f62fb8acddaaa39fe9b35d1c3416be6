President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s visit to Ukambani is late and will not earn him votes, Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana has said. He spoke on Friday at Emali town, Kibwezi West constituency, when he commissioned Emali modern bus station funded by his government.The governor said the Jubilee administration has failed to implement major projects in the region that directly affect residents, and that Uhuru should not expect any support. &ldquo;If Uhuru had listened to us from 2013 when we gave him the projects we wanted done, then his visit would have yielded ground to votes,&rdquo; he said. Kibwana said failure by the Jubilee government to build Thwake Multipurpose Dam, Konza City, and other major roads will cost Uhuru the Presidency.
