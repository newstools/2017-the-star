The deep-seated rivalry between National Assembly Majority leader Aden Duale and former Deputy Speaker Farah Maalim flared on Thursday night at a peace meeting.The two frontrunners for Garissa Township MP &mdash; JP incumbent Duale and Wiper&rsquo;s Maalim &mdash; traded accusations.The peace meeting was convened by the IEBC. Maalim and Duale did not shake hands.Trouble began when Maalim was invited by Senator Yusuf Haji to speak on behalf of NASA candidates. Maalim lashed out at the IEBC and security agents, whom he accused of trying to subvert the people&rsquo;s will.&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not cheat one another that people fight over polls. The genesis of violence is those mandated to manage elections try to manipulate results by rigging and going against the will of the people,&rdquo; he said.Maalim said there will be no violence if the IEBC conducts free, fair and credible polls.&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve information that some people plan to use security agents and IEBC officials to steal votes in August. You must guard against this if we are to avoid plunging the country into violence,&rdquo; he said.When Duale spoke on behalf of Jubilee candidates, he accused Maalim of using most of his time to accuse and intimidate IEBC officials and security agents by claiming his own votes will be stolen.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s wananchi who vote, not the IEBC or security agencies. I appeal to my brother to redirect his energy to solicit votes,instead of peddling lies and rumours over the polls,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;My friend is preparing supporters psychologically for a loss by casting doubt on IEBC&rsquo;s ability to carry out free, fair and credible polls. As Jubilee, we are prepared. If our competitors are not ready, they should tell Kenyans.&rdquo;IEBC commissioner Abdi Yakub Guliye assured candidates that strong anti-rigging measures will be in place.Northeastern regional coordinator Mohammud Saleh defended security agents, saying their only role is to ensure peace.Troublemakers will be sternly punished, he said.
