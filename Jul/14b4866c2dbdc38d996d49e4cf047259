Former powerful minister and veteran politician Nicholas Biwott, 77, died at a Nairobi hospital on Tuesday after a&nbsp;long illness. Famously known as 'Total Man', he was one of the most&nbsp; trusted lieutenants in the political life of retired President Daniel Arap Moi. The former Keiyo South MP's name emerged during a speech in parliament where he said: "It was important for a politician to be a man, a total man." Biwott was also nicknamed "The Bull of Auckland" following an assault incident in New Zealand.&nbsp; James Orengo, during a sitting in November 15, 1995, used the term when he sought to inquire why GG Kariuki was being allowed to speak from the dispatch box. This was was a jab at Biwott for indecently exposing himself in Auckland five days before the said parliamentary sitting. The incident was reported during a Commonwealth heads of state meeting attended by President Moi in New Zealand. Biwott was accused of an attempt to sexually assault a housekeeper who sought to clean his room. The woman ran out of the room and informed her manager who called in the police. The police in turn called the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and a small, important but often overlooked diplomatic spat followed. In his his memoirs, former Vice President Kalonzo Musyoka said that&nbsp; Kenya threatened to leave the 1995 Commonwealth summit in Auckland if news of the alleged sexual harassment of a hotel maid by a senior member of its delegation was leaked. In 2016, there were rumours Biwott had died of which he urged the police to investigate those spreading the malicious reports."I am fine and in good health. I am alive," Biwott said at the time.Biwott said he 'will live long', despite the wishes of those who have been attempting to kill him through social media.This was the second time claims of Biwott&rsquo;s death had been peddled on social media in two years.Read:&nbsp;I&rsquo;m alive and well, says Biwott amid death rumours
