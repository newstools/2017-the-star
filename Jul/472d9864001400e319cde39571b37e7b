A clergyman has appealed to NASA and Jubilee leaders to contain their followers for peace to prevail during the August 8 polls.Bishop John Nduati of God's Power Church said politicians from both sides of the divide must strive to ensure their supporters do not cause disharmony.The general election is 32 days away and is bound to get steamier as campaigns, especially for the presidency, head to the homestretch.Nduati urged leaders to spread the message of peace when selling their manifestos which were launched last week."The manifestos by the two leading coalitions have issues that promise a good future for Kenyans. Let us sell them while rallying for tranquility ahead of the polls."He said every Kenyan has the right to back a candidate of choice and asked voters not to interfere with the choices of their counterparts in the competition."I am backing President Uhuru Kenyatta's re-election and the election of Mike Sonko as Nairobi governor. This doesn't stop me from listening to other Kenyans with divergent views," Nduati said in an interview on Thursday.He said Kenyans must maintain the peace and tranquility the country has enjoyed for the past four and a half years.Nduati's call followed others by clergymen who have rallied the country to uphold peace in campaigns and after the general election.On July 4, a Bungoma bishop warned against the publication of opinion polls projecting the likely results of the polls.Bishop Shiundu Wasike of Reformed Catholic Church said opinion polls might play a role in stoking animosities between communities.He said some groups may turn against each other and resort to violence in the event of dissatisfaction with the outcome.Wasike urged politicians to take note of the EU observers warning that the country might be plunged into chaos during the election.Earlier, Bishop Maurice Muhatia of the Nakuru Catholic diocese asked the government to assure citizens of their security.Read: Kenya could be hit by post-election violence, EU warnsAlso read: No cause for worry on elections, Kenya says after EU warning
