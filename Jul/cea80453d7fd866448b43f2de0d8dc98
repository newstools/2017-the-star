Youth and Gender CS Sicily Kariuki on Wednesday urged youth to stop abusing drugs and alcohol. She said youths are the future of the country and are expected to carry themselves with dignity because they are needed to build the nation. The CS spoke in Kisii county, where she launched NYS Youth Empowerment Programme. She said youths will be hired to open trenches, clean and build roads.  “The Jubilee government is committed to ensuring that youths lead better lives in future.  That is why it is coming up with such programmes,” Bomachoge Borabu MP Joel Onyancha said. MP Stephen Manoti of Bobasi asked youths to engage in peaceful campaigns. Bomachoge Chache’s Simon Ogari, and Nyaribari Masaba’s Elijah Moindi attended the launch in their respective constituencies.
