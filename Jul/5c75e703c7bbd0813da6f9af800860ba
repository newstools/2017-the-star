Busia county plans to tarmac more roads to improve transport. Roads and Transport executive Bernard Yaite yesterday said those to be tarmacked are Port Victoria Plaza-Highway and St Joseph Girls Signpost-Highway. He said the Highway-Farm View Hotel road has been completed. Yaite said another two roads in Malaba totaling 3.4 kilometres have been upgraded to bitumen standards. Three others are set for tarmacking in the town. Eleven roads totalling 5.3km will be tarmacked in Busia town, and the second phase will cover 4km. Yaite dismissed critics for saying tarmacking has started late. “There is no lateness in development. Things are done according to plan and based on priorities,” he said. “The county government has put in place a firm foundation for development, which started with the opening up of 1,700km of rural roads. "They help farmers to access markets and facilitate communication.” Yaite said the county will soon start tarmacking roads in other urban centres.
