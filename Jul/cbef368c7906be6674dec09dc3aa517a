Lisiagali noted stakeholders have a lot to do in addressing and preventing the cases."There are also many instances where such cases go unnoticed as victims fear reporting because of cultural values," she told a&nbsp; media sensitisation forum on Gender Based Violence in Kisumu on Monday. The director also urged men to come out and report cases of violence, saying many are violated but choose to remain silent. HAK also wants the government to protect women more against violence as the country is in the crucial stage of heightened campaigns for the August 8 general election.Lisiagali said many women witnessed cases of violence during nominations and should be kept safe in the run up to the poll.Most reports during the primaries were of women either being intimidated or assaulted. &ldquo;We must look into ways of protecting women against political violence so their democratic right to contest positions is not infringed upon,&rdquo; the HAK boss said.On June 20,&nbsp;Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery asked women politicians to prepare for tough battles but promised their security will be beefed up ahead of the election. The Cabinet Secretary acknowledged that male politicians are also threatened but said this is not in the same degree as women.Read: You must be tough, Nkaissery tells female politicians but promises securityAlso read: Gender-based violence still high, hurts efforts to empower women&nbsp;
