Prosecution yesterday opposed a bail application by seven suspects charged with the murder of former Kabete MP George Muchai, his two bodyguards and a driver two years ago. It said although bail is a constitutional right, the circumstances and facts of the case do not weigh in their favour. All seven suspects have applied to be released on bail, saying they are not a flight risk. They said they are ready to comply with all conditions set by the court. The accused are Margaret Wachuiri, Raphael Gachii, alias Butcher Kimani Anyonyi alias Musti, Stephen Lipapo, alias Chokore, Erick Isabwa, alias chairman, Jane Kamau, alias Shiro, and Simon Gichamba. But the prosecution, led by senior state counsel Catherine Mwaniki, said the harsh penalty the suspects are staring at is an incentive for them to jump bail. Muchai, bodyguards Samuel Kalikia and Samuel Matanta, and driver Stephen Wambugu were killed in a hail of bullets on the night of February 6 and 7, 2015, on Kenyatta Avenue, Nairobi. The accused have denied committing the murders. Trial judge Jane Wakiaga will deliver the ruling on the bail application on September 28. The suspects are on trial before Justice Wakiaga and chief magistrate Francis Andayi for murder and violent robbery respectively. Wakiaga directed Muchaiâ€™s vehicle be released to his wife Susan Nyawira. Wakiaga warned that the car is not to be transferred to her name but only to be given to her for use as it is wasting away at the DCI for non-use. The court also visited the crime scene opposite Nyayo House at the GPO bus stage. The area was secured in the morning and police diverted traffic to avoid disturbance.
