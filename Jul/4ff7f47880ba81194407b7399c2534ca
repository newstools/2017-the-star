A conflict has arisen between Homa Bay MCAs and speaker Samuel Ochillo over performance after the speaker said they underperformed. He released the scorecard last Thursday. &ldquo;On most occasions I would go to the assembly without anything for discussion because the MCAs had failed to generate the House business,&rdquo; he said. Ochillo said the MCAs were lazy. The assembly was dissolved last Thursday.
