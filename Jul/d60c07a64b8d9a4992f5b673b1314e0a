Budalang'i MP Ababu Namwamba&rsquo;s war with ODM leader Raila Odinga appears to be far from over and this is most likely to lead to confrontations between the supporters of the two leaders. Namwamba accused Raila of allegedly imposing leaders on the people of Busia. He spoke to Jubilee and Labour Party of Kenya delegates in Funyula on Friday.&ldquo;I want Raila to give the people of Busia the opportunity to elect the leaders they want, rather than pushing them to elect the people they do not want. He should stop imposing leaders on the people as this is outright violation of the peoples democratic right,&rdquo; the former ODM secretary general said.Namwamba's accusation followed Raila&rsquo;s campaign trail in Budalang'i on June 26, where he endorsed former Budalang'i MP Raphael Wanjala and Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong for MP and governor slots, respectively.&ldquo;I want to tell the Busia people that many projects in the county were grounded because I chose to walk with bad people who do not have your interest at heart. But since I began working closely President Uhuru Kenyatta, things have started taking shape,&rdquo; he said. Namwamba said the national government will start construction of Mulwanda Bridge in Funyula constituency which has stalled.
