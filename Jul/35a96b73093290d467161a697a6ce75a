Seventeen days to D-Day and the race too close to call, so President Uhuru Kenyatta and NASA chief Raila Odinga are zeroing in on high voter turnout.Each vote counts.From opinion polls, it appears that whoever can dispel malaise and disaffection and galvanise voters has a better chance of victory on August 8.Raila is even telling his supporters &mdash; perhaps in jest, perhaps not &mdash; not to have sex on election eve so they they awake rested and energised to cast ballots vote, make sure others do and protect the NASA vote against rigging.A total of 19.6 million votes is up for grabs in Kenya's most hotly contested and expensive election.Worries about turnout have forced Kenyatta and Raila to shift gears to energise loyal supporters in their strongholds and battlegrounds to get out and vote.That both protagonists are campaigning furiously in their bedrocks underscores the fears of an enthusiasm gap.They have intensified their campaign blitz, scouring each other&rsquo;s strongholds and buttressing their own to secure a first-round, knock-out victory. Pollsters say a run-off is likely.Uhuru and Ruto will soon take to the airwaves to appeal to voters, especially in their vernacular.Vernacular radio talk shows are planned for Kenyatta, Ruto and some Cabinet Secretaries. the dates have not been settled but the Star has established that the vernacular blitz will be in the last week of the campaign ending August 6.This is part of Jubilee's last-ditch effort.Uhuru will be on Kamame FM, broadcasting in Kikuyu. DP Ruto will be behind the microphones at popular Kalenjin Kass FM. It was not immediately known if NASA, which describes itself as the face of Kenya, will also take to the airwaves and make an emotional connection wit their base in Luhya, Luo and Kamba. Apart from Uhuru and Ruto, Cabinet Secretaries and other influential party leaders will also be interviewed on vernacular radio stations broadcasting to their regions.The CSs are under instruction to explain and extol Jubilee's scorecard over five years.With most polls showing a tighter State House race, both campaign teams could be buoyed by the vernacular strategy to get supporters to come out and vote.According to the latest opinion polls, neither Uhuru nor his Raila would win in the first round if elections were held today.Surveys by leading pollsters indicate a possible run-off as neither candidates is likely to manage the constitutional 50 per cent-plus-one-vote threshold necessary to avoid a rerun.In the 2013 presidential contest, Raila&rsquo;s loss to Uhuru was partly blamed on low voter turnout in his key strongholds of Nyanza, Western and Coast regions.In a spectacular appeal to his backers, Raila has asked his supporters to avoid sex on the election eve so they can wake up early, refreshed, vote and remain vigilant protecting votes throughout the day.The opposition chief has likened the election to a war, saying sex before the day warriors go to battle is a bad omen that could result in defeat. &ldquo;We are going into a war and we must fully conserve our energies before the day of battle, which is August 8,&rdquo; he said in Homa Bay on Monday."When you are going for war, sex is a bad omen. None of us should have sex on the eve of the polls.&rdquo;Speaking in Kibra constituency on Tuesday, Raila also appealed to his voters in Nairobi not to relocate family members registered as voters in the capital.&ldquo;Do not send home your wives during the Election Day, let them remain in Nairobi and vote,&rdquo; the opposition chief said.In another strategic move to consolidate his Western bastion, Raila's surrogates Musalia Mudavadi of ANC and Moses Wetang'ula of Ford Kenya will make a last-ditch effort to rally voters.In their series of rallies aimed at psych the rich vote bloc, the two NASA principals urged the Mulembe nation to turn out in large numbers and ensure landslide victory for Raila.&ldquo;We appeal to our people to ensure they give us 99 per cent voter turnout and help us redeem this country from miseries Jubilee has plunged it into,&rdquo; Mudavadi said on Wednesday in Bungoma.Wetang'ula explained that Mudavadi and he shelved their presidential ambitions in order to liberate the country and line up behind a single candidate. They need to fire up their supporters who are disappointed they were not chosen as the NASA presidential flagbearer.&ldquo;NASA will win if you come out and vote on August 8,&rdquo; the Ford Kenya party leader told supporters. With 17 days until Election Day, Uhuru and Ruto have vigorously denounced NASA criticism that they have failed to deliver and that the country is mired in economic misery and corruption.NASA has said another pass to State House for Uhuru and Ruto would be a direct ticket to enrich themselves at the expense of poor Kenyans.&ldquo;Come out in large numbers and vote for Jubilee, our votes are with you. If you want a prosperous future, then wake up on the Election Day and vote for Jubilee,&rdquo; Uhuru said in his Coast tour on Wednesday.Uhuru and his strategists are concerned that their vigorous campaign strategies could be undercut by apathy and poor voter turnout.Already dozens of Uhuru&rsquo;s lobbyists have stepped up their rallies to urge voters to turn out in large numbers to save Kenya and vote for Uhuru. Jubilee Mbele Iko Sawa campaign team and the UhuRuto Express Caravan are some of the lobby groups that have urged 100 per cent voter turnout, saying they must counter the tough fight mounted by the opposition.
