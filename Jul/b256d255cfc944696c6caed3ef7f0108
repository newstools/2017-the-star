Butali Sugar warriors captain Kenneth Nyongesa believes they are still in the title contention despite succumbing to arch rivals Kenya Police 2-1 in KHU Premier League match at the City Park Stadium on Saturday night.And following weekend results, the law enforcers have opened an 8-points gap at the top from 13 matches. Police have 37 points while Butali have 29 points but with a match in hand. Greensharks complete the top three places with 27 points from 13 matches. Nyongesa believes it is not over yet and they shouldn&rsquo;t be written off. Police last won the title in 2013 and have good chances of recapturing it if they can maintain same form. &ldquo;Of course many have already tipped Police to win. But they should know anything can happen and we are not giving up just yet,&rdquo; said Nyongesa. Police goals came through Moses Cheplaiti and Samuel Wokila in the 8th and 13 minutes respectively while Emmanuel Simiyu pulled one back in the 22nd minute through a penalty corner for the Kisumu-based outfit. In the women&rsquo;s match played yesterday, Kenyatta University won against University of Nairobi 6-0. Gloria Juma scored four goals in the 15th, 33rd, 51st and 60th minute respectively as Mitchel Ogwe and Belinda Kulundu added a goal each for coach Simon Mwangi side.
