NASA will announce its tallied presidential results if the IEBC delays to release them, Siaya Senator James Orengo has said. He said this will prepare the public should the IEBC try to compromise the results. Orengo said the law does not direct the opposition to wait for the IEBC results to make known its tallied version. He spoke during campaign rallies in Gem and Alego/Usonga constituencies on Wednesday. Orengo said NASA will give its agents high-tech phones for scanning presidential result forms for transmission to their secure servers. “As IEBC will be counting, we will also count. When they transmit, our agents will also transmit,” he said. Orengo was with MP Opiyo Wandayi of Ugunja, Homa Bay woman rep Gladys Wanga, and her Siaya counterpart Christine Ombaka.
