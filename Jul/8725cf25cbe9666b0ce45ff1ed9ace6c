 Members of Usonga ODM Young Democrats have embarked on a marathon campaign to encourage young people to uphold peace ahead of the August 8 General Election. Speaking during a forum at Kamalunga village on Sunday, chairman Lawrence Ochanda said politicians take advantage of the unemployed youth and misuse them during their campaigns for their own political mileage. He said development can only be achieved in a peaceful environment. “So we have unanimously resolved to engage in a marathon sensitisation campaign in Alego/Usonga constituency to urge youth to promote peace during the campaigns and after the election,” Ochanda said. “Life is more important than one’s political party affiliation,” Dan Odhiambo said. Vice chairman Michael Onyango urged youth to turn out in large numbers and vote on August 8.
