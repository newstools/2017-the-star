Wiper is the only party that has not renominated a member to the national or county assembly and the Senate, Secretary General Hassan Omar has said.The Mombasa Senator and governor candidate said the marginalised, people living with disabilities, young women and youth were considered by the party led by NASA DP candidate Kalonzo Musyoka.Unlike other parties, he said, names of financiers, friends and girlfriends were removed from the Wiper list that was presented to the IEBC for gazetting.&ldquo;People who had means, capacity and resources to win elections were allowed to vie but did not qualify for this special group,&rdquo; he said."In the Mombasa assembly, a 23-year old university graduate has been nominated. We were even thinking of nominating a female journalist but she was reluctant. She said she was still building her career."Omar said allies have filled the list of nominees in other parties.&ldquo;This [prioritising the under-privileged] is the kind of nomination were are bringing on board."He issued the remarks on Friday during the Senate leadership retreat with the Kenya Editors Guild at English Point Marina.Omar urged the election of more women the Senate and discouraged reliance on affirmative action.He also questioned the aspect of fair coverage during the campaign season, saying it is illogical for broadcasters to strive to give NASA and Jubilee equal shares of coverage at prime time in the name of &ldquo;fair coverage&rdquo;.&ldquo;I see you really struggling to give Jubilee and NASA three minutes of airtime each during the news hour. This is not fair coverage. You don&rsquo;t have to put Jubilee in if it has said nothing."He noted the fair coverage which entails right of reply should only be given to factions that address issues.On June 14, The Kenya National Commission on Human Rights accused President Uhuru Kenyatta of using public resources in his Jubilee campaigns.The rights body further said Uhuru is violating the law by dishing out goodies to certain areas, weeks to the general election. It says this amounts to voter bribery.More on this: Uhuru using public resources in Jubilee campaigns - KNCHRRead: Duale pushes changes to elections law for campaigns on media platforms
