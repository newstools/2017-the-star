PNU&rsquo;s Embu governor candidate Kithinji Kiragu has accused some of his rivals of bribing voters.He said the candidates want to influence the outcome of the August 8 election through illegal means, instead of persuading them based on their manifestos.Kiragu said such candidates do not care about residents&rsquo;. &ldquo;They are only interested in power for selfish gain and are keen to get it at whatever cost,&rdquo; he said, cautioning voters against electing corrupt politicians.Kiragu said the cash handouts must have been stolen from public coffers.&ldquo;If elected, they will focus on recovering the money they are now dishing out to voters. They will have no time for development,&rdquo; he said.Kiragu advised voters to take the money, but vote in a person who has their interests at heart, saying &ldquo;that person is me&rdquo;.
