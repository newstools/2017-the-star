President Edgar Lungu said on Thursday he had invoked emergency powers in Zambia to deal with "acts of sabotage" by the opposition, after fire gutted the country's biggest market.Lungu said the measure in Africa's second-biggest copper producer would safeguard investments in the country but if the International Monetary Fund found the emergency powers to be ill-advised, it was free to terminate talks meant to provide financial assistance to Zambia."This power (state of emergency) I have invoked is only for seven days," Lungu said, a day after saying that the fire in the capital was politically motivated arson."Parliament will within the next seven days determine whether it will be there for one week, one month, three months or six months."Lungu said the powers would not disrupt normal life, but were aimed at those who posed a danger to public security.Under state of emergency laws, police can prohibit public meetings, close roads, impose curfews and restrict movements.Unknown people destroyed electricity pylons on a high-voltage line a week ago, leading to a power blackout in some mining areas. Fires have been started in courtrooms and a building belonging to the ministry of education.Read: Zambia's president to seek parliament backing for state of emergency
