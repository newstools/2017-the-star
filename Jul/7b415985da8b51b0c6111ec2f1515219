Embu Senator Lenny Kivuti and his wife Hilda (pictured) have joined forces to campaign for his governor bid. He has provided his wife one of his choppers for the campaigns while he traverses the county in a fleet of vehicles. Kivuti is running on the Maendeleo Chap Chap ticket. He is quite wealthy and is said to own three choppers, which he uses in his local, national and international surveying contracts with his Geomap Company. Kivuti is up against the incumbent, Governor Martin Wambora, World Bank consultant Kithinji Kiragu of PNU, former Transport PS Cyrus Njiru (independent), psychiatrist Dr Njagi Kumantha (DP) and entrepreneur Leonard Muriuki of Narc Kenya. Kivuti has formed campaign committees and appointed agents to market his bid. He has published a magazine pointing out the projects he has initiated since he was an MP, which he says are worth Sh83billion.
