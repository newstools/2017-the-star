The number of hungry people in the world has increased since 2015, reversing 25 years of progress, FAO Director-General Graziano da Silva has said.Da Silva said almost 60 per cent of people suffering hunger in the world live in countries affected by conflict and climate change. The Food and Agriculture Organization currently identifies 19 countries as being in a protracted crisis situation, often also facing extreme climatic events such as droughts and floods.It has signaled high risk of famine in northeast Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan and Yemen with 20 million people severely affected.Read: Worsening hunger crises fueling global migration - UN studyAlso read: FAO seeks Sh102 billion to feed 40m hungry peopleThe livelihoods of these mostly rural people have been disrupted and "many of them have found no option other than increasing the statistics of distress migration,"Da Silva said. "Strong political commitment to eradicate hunger is fundamental, but it is not enough," he said on Monday during FAO's biennial conference in Rome."Hunger will only be defeated if countries translate their pledges into action, especially at national and local levels. "Peace is of course key to ending these crises but we cannot wait for peace to take action and FAO, the World Food Program and the International Fund for Agricultural Development are all working hard to assist vulnerable people."De Silva noted the importance of ensuring thepeople can produce their own food."Vulnerable rural people cannot be left behind, especially youth and women."Some 1,100 participants are attending the meeting. They include one head of state, one prime minister, 82 ministers and numerous representatives from international organizations, the private sector and civil society.FAO's top priorities for the next two years include promoting sustainable agriculture, climate change mitigation and adaptation, poverty reduction, water scarcity, migration and the support of conflict-affected rural livelihoods.Others are ongoing work on nutrition, fisheries, forestry and Antimicrobial Resistance. "We cannot save people by putting them in camps," insisted Graziano da Silva. "To save lives, we have to save their livelihoods," said the DG.UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner said the role of agriculture is far greater and spans extraordinary narratives about people, land and their cultures.He said this in a lecture focused on the future agricultural economy in the wake of the Paris Agreement on climate change.He acknowledged agriculture accounts for only four per cent of the global gross domestic but added: "Inadequate policy and budgetary attention to a sector currently affected by high levels of waste and the erosion of natural resources reflects a high-risk strategy."
