Nakuru governor candidate John Mututho wants cage fishing introduced in Lake Naivasha to improve production.The former Naivasha MP said the method is the way to go and would see less space of the lake used and the rest saved for tourism activities.&ldquo;What we need to do is to take about 100 kilometres east and west of the lake for cage fishing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This means that we can produce millions of metric tonnes in a small space. It will also end the poaching menace in the lake&rdquo;.Mututho said the method current;y used by fishermen is outdated, costly and time-consuming.&ldquo;We need a serious cage system in this lake if we have to increase the value of the product,&rdquo; he said.Mututho said Kenya must adopt new technologies to be at par with the rest of the world.&ldquo;Sometimes back, we put over 10 million fingerlings in this lake, but all that is gone because of poor management, coupled with the challenges that are currently facing the lake,&rdquo; he said.He said Egerton University has come up with scientific methods of fish breeding and they should be used.
