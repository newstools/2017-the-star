The contest for the Nairobi Senate seat is seen as a two-horse race between nominated MP Johnson Sakaja of Jubilee Party and lawyer Edwin Sifuna of ODM.Others in the race include Wiper&rsquo;s Ramesh Gorasia, John Wamagata, who is vying on the Safina Party ticket, and Republican Liberty Party&rsquo;s Zacharia Momanyi.Independent candidate Suzanne Silantoi and Dennis Nthumbi of Agano Party are also gunning for the seat.They want to replace outgoing senator Mike Sonko, who will run for governor. Save for Sakaja and Sifuna, the other candidates are greenhorns in politics. Nairobi ODM chairman George Aladwa said Sifuna is guaranteed victory &ldquo;because of NASA&rsquo;s strength, support from his community, and being a vocal lawyer, he is able to stand on his own&rdquo;.Aladwa said NASA shared elective seats among communities allied to it.In the sharing formula, members of the Luhya community were given the Senate seat, Kikuyus got the woman representative seat through Esther Passaris.Luos and Kambas were to retain the governor and deputy governor seats respectively, through incumbent Evans Kidero and his deputy Jonathan Mueke.&ldquo;Luhyas have more than 800,000 registered voters in Nairobi as per the latest IEBC register, who will vote as a bloc. Sakaja is not considered a Luhya because he comes from Trans Nzoia county. Adding the Luo and Kamba votes and all others in NASA, he is guaranteed victory,&rdquo; Aladwa said.But Nairobi Jubilee chairman Sanctus Ndegwa said Sakaja will beat Sifuna by a large margin. He said Jubilee is not worried about winning the Senate seat, but rather is focussed on the governor and woman representative posts. He said Sakaja has Jubilee&rsquo;s solid support.
