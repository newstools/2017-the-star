President Uhuru Kenyatta yesterday criticised the leading opposition figures for having the worst track records on delivery after being in leadership positions for many decades.The President said a look at the performance of the two leading figures of the main opposition group shows how dismal their performance is.Uhuru said Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka has no credibility to stand in front of millions of Kenyans and make grand promises "when he had failed to ensure his own home village gets water"."What can Kalonzo deliver when we are the ones taking water to Tseikuru, his own home villages, where he was MP for many decades?" he asked.The President spoke when he addressed Jubilee supporters in Mashuru, Kajiado county.Uhuru also took a swipe at NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga, who he said was the MP for Kibera for decades, but never solved the problems residents face."We are issuing title deeds to the Nubians of Kibera after all those years," the President said.He also accused Raila of not doing anything meaningful for the people of Kajiado for all the years he served in government, or even when he was the Prime Minister."Why didn't he do something about the roads here in Kajiado when he was the minister of roads?" the President asked.The President, who is on a meet-the-people tour of Kajiado county, said the Jubilee administration has served all Kenyans equally.Speaking in Bissil, the president said the government will write-off debts that livestock farmers in Kajiado county owes to the Agricultural Finance Corporation He said the intervention is aimed at saving the livestock farmers from having their land auctioned for delayed payment of the loans they took to boost their stock.&ldquo;While the waiver of debts will benefit all livestock farmers in the county, I have directed AFC to start with those whose land is most at risk of being auctioned so they can get back the title deeds they gave as security,&rdquo; Uhuru said.He criticised the opposition for promoting divisions that are harming the country's unity."It is the politics of divisions that causes poverty," the President said.Jubilee candidate for Kajiado governor Joseph ole Lenku said the party will bag all the seats in the county.&ldquo;We will deliver all the 25 MCAs, five MPs, senator and covernor on August 8,&rdquo; he said.Kajiado East MP Peris Tobiko said she is happy with the development projects initiated by the Jubilee administration in her constituency.&ldquo;This is the second time you are visiting Mashuru and we are happy with the road projects that are opening up Kajiado county,&rdquo; she said.
