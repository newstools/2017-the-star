Nestl&eacute; Kenya has launched the Healthy Kids Programme, an educational project on nutrition and physical activities for primary school pupils in Nyeri county.The programme will help children understand and be able to identify balanced meals, and teach them exercises that will help them to be physically fit.Regulatory affairs and corporate communication and public affairs manager at Nestl&eacute; Kenya James Ojiambo said the project is meant to help Kenya address nutrition issues among schoolgoing children aged six to 12 years. He made the announcement during a training held on Saturday at a Nyeri hotel, which brought together close to 200 teachers from 62 primary schools in the county.&ldquo;Malnutrition presents significant threats to human health. The world faces a double burden of malnutrition that includes both undernutrition and overweight, especially in developing countries. We want to support children and their families to live healthier lives,&rdquo; Ojiambo said.
