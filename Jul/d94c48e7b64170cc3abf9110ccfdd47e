Presidential hopeful Solomon Gichira has gone to court again to challenge IEBC's decision to lock him out of the August 8 polls. Under a certificate of urgency, he on Monday claimed the electoral agency disobeyed court orders that allowed him to contest. Following the orders issued on July 16, Gichira wants the court to issue a date to hear the contempt case against IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati. The politician, who says he has not given up on interests to seek the presidency, wants the matter to be heard and determined expeditiously. In May, the contestant was charged with attempting to kill himself, creating disturbance and destroying IEBC property. He allegedly wanted to jump from the sixth floor of Anniversary Towers after the commission told him he would not be cleared. The court refused to grant him the personal bond but released him on Sh200,000 cash bail and wished him well. Read:Â Police arrest presidential hopeful Solomon Gichira after suicide attempt
