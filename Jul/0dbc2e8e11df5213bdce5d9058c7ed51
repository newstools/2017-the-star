A prison officer shot and killed a man under unclear circumstances in Kilifi town on Sunday morning.Reports indicated Jamal Washe was killed at Kibaoni stage by an officer identified only as Abdi.Kilifi police boss Alexander Makau said Washe was shot after attacking the officer.&ldquo;Police officers were on a routine patrol when they found Jamal with knives and bhang. He ran away but later returned and picked stones which he threw at the officers," he said."They managed to dodge the first and second throws but the third stone hit the officer who decided to shoot him."But Washe's brother Rama Gambo disputed Makau's statement saying he was not armed and did not hurl any stones.Gambo said two police officers went to a drugs den near Kibaoni stage and took someone's phone.&ldquo;Jamal was taking tea near the stage. He decided to go see what was happening at Migamuni. The officers fired in the air so he started running," he narrated."The prison officer shot him in the back and the bullet went through his chest. I witnessed my brother being shot. He fell to the ground across the road."Gambo said a Land Cruiser then arrived and the officers were picked."Another Land Cruiser arrived with more officers but angry members of the public started attacking the officers. My brother was dead by then. The officer who was injured was not among those who killed my brother."Human rights activist Baraka Thoya brought up the issue of extrajudicial killings, also saying Washe was not armed.&ldquo;This boy was running away...that&rsquo;s why he was shot in the back. He would have been shot from the front had he been attacking the officers," said Baraka.Read: Residents barricaded Mombasa-Malindi road at Kibaoni for hours and burnt tyres.Police officers who went to collect the body were forced to fire in the air to scare crowds away.They later took control of Kilifi county hospital mortuary and did not allow any member of the public near it.
