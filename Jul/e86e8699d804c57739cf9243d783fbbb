Presidential candidate Abduba Dida (pictured) has rejected a new offer by the police to attach four GSU officers as part of his security detail.Dida yesterday declined to the new offer by Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet and insisted that he must get the 20 security guards that he has requested.The police revised the number of officers attached to the aspirant from two to four after Dida protested the initial number of two GSU officers.Yesterday, Dida declined to receive four GSU officers sent to guard him and insisted that he would not accept anything less that the 20 he had requested.The four officers returned to police headquarters, Vigilance House, and informed their seniors of the latest development.Dida is making a second attempt at the presidency.In March 4, 2013, Dida garnered 52,840 votes.Besides the 20 officers, Dida also wants the government to provide the police officers attached to him vehicles, which they will use during the campaigns.Police had earlier rejected Thirdway Alliance Party presidential candidate Ekuru Aukot&rsquo;s request for 15 security officers to guard his running mate Emmanuel Nzai, his wife, parents and children.Aukot had requested the IG to send him police officers, drawn mainly from the General Duty.The team charged with looking into the VIP demands, however, offered him two officers and directed that Aukot can always walk to any police station and request additional security.On June 8, Boinnet declined a request by NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga for 50 police officers.Raila, who enjoys the protection of 16 officers, had requested an additional 34 officers and police vehicles.
