Nairobi Jubilee politician Francis Mwangi has called on Jubilee Party to avoid recycling leaders in nominations and appointment to government jobs.Speaking in Nairobi yesterday, Mwangi asked the party to ensure the nomination list presented to the IEBC is fair and balanced.He praised the party, saying the list gives it a national outlook. &ldquo;We are glad that our party was able to ensure gender balance in allocating slots because those picked have shown commitment to the party,&rdquo; he said. Mwangi, who lost in the Starehe MP primaries, further called on those who have been nominated to ensure they implement their manifestos and that of Jubilee.&ldquo;They must be ready to serve the President and help him to deliver in his second term,&rdquo; Mwangi said.&ldquo;We are all willing and ready to work with those who clinched Jubilee tickets to ensure President Uhuru Kenyatta gets enough footsoldiers in both Houses and wins with 70 per cent plus one votes.
