The government has assured Kericho farmers it is ready to deal with fall army worms that have invaded farms in the region.Agriculture PS Richard Lesiyampe said recently that they have distributed some 40,000 litres of pesticides.He said farms infested by the destructive pest will be sprayed and that the operation will be executed in all the 25 affected counties.The PS gave the assurance during a field day last week, organised by Kenya Plant Health Inspectorate Service and the Kericho government.He urged farmers, stakeholders, and agricultural scientists to join hands in the fight against the invasive pests.Lesiyampe emphasised the importance of using certified seeds as the first step in getting good yields to boost food security.He said Kephis and several seed companies have certified seeds that guarantee farmers good harvest."Farmers have to familiarise themselves with labels on seed packets to avoid buying fake seeds from unscrupulous companies."Energy CS Charles Keter told farmers to diversify their crops to prevent Maize Lethal Necrosis Disease (MLND) and attacks by the army worm.Keter advised the farmers to plant sorghum, peas, sweet potatoes, Irish potatoes and hay instead of overly relying on maize.Governor Paul Chepkwony said the county has set aside Sh4 million for the fight against the army worm.Kephis MD Esther Kimani said the agency will provide technical advice how to achieve better yields.Read: Armyworm invasion in Rift Valley latest major threat to grain basket
