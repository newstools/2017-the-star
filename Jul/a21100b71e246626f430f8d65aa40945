Three Migori governor candidates vanished into thin air after they were cleared by the IEBC, leaving two frontrunners to battle it out. Incumbent Okoth Obado of ODM and former Cabinet Minister Ochilo Ayacko, an independent, have intensified their campaigns. Jack Okoth  of ANC, Jubilee’s Chrispinus Weiria and independent Sammy Ogallo  are yet to put up posters, banners and fliers 18 days to the election. The three have not held any major rally. Ogallo flew to the US three days after he was cleared. “Each time we call him he says he will be back soon. We have only distributed posters in Rongo, his home turf, and posted a few messages on social media. He stopped picking our calls,” a campaign team member told the Star. Ogallo is a businessman.
