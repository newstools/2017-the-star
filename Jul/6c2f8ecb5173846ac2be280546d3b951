Deputy President William Ruto will not attend today's running mates debate on grounds he was never consulted on the matter. The running mates' debate between Ruto and NASA co-principal Kalonzo Musyoka is to take place at the Catholic University of Eastern Africa. "I am surprised no one has engaged me on the debate. Courtesy demands that date, time, rules of engagement would have been made available," he told the Star on Monday. The DP said it was unfair to hear about the debate on social media but not from the organisers. "Is alright! Anyway, good luck with those who were engaged. I guess there must be reasons why the unequal treatment," he added. For their part, the organisers said they wrote a letter to the Deputy President's office on the details of the debate. "We wrote to him, his office received the letter and it was signed," Wachira Waruru of Debates Media told the Star on phone. Earlier, State House director of digital communication Dennis Itumbi said the DP will not attend. He said Ruto will lead Jubilee reelection campaigns in Lamu, Garsen and Kilifi counties in preparation for the August 8 general election. It is not clear whether Kalonzo will attend the debate. This came days after Ruto tweeted that he was not aware that there was going to be a debate. "Just seen news alert that there will be a debate of running mates. Is it true?" Ruto said on his official twitter page on Friday. But Kenyans on Twitter were not amused by the tweet as many Kenyans asked him where he was when the announcement was made. "It's clear you guys don't live in Kenya or you simply realise debates will not just help you. Things are thick," a user identified as Majani Chasia‏ said.
