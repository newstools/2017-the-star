Hawa, Bongo singer and video vixen for the song Nitarejea, has revealed that she has been living with alcohol and tobacco addiction for almost two years now. The star, who is said to be Diamond’s baby mama, got married in 2015. However, just four months after her grand wedding, her husband left her for good after saying he was traveling for work and would come back, something he never did. “My husband’s absence made depression creep up, pushing me into consuming more and more alcohol; smoking more tobacco sticks, I was waiting for him to return. I had no money to buy expensive alcohol. I therefore resorted to cheap liquor,” she said.
