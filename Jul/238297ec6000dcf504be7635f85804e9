Deputy President William Ruto on Monday returned to Western Kenya to drum up support for the Jubilee Party ahead of the August 8 polls.Ruto addressed rallies in Likuyani, Ndalu, Kapsokwony, Mumias, and Malava grounds in Bungoma and Kakamega counties respectively.He asked voters to back the Jubilee Administration saying its agenda is to transform the lives of Kenyans.The DP said it would be an uphill task for the National Super Alliance (Nasa) to win the polls since they no plan for Kenyans.Ruto cautioned the electorate against voting for those he said were more concerned about creating positions for themselves."Their (Nasa) aim is to divide the people along the ethnic line, with the aim of wooing their support, at the expense of uniting them."Read: Ruto in tight spot over Wanjigi-NASA connection, dismisses links"No one votes with the intention of losing but to win. This is why you should vote for Jubilee as it is destined to win the next election," Ruto said.The Deputy President said Kenyans want to have a peaceful election which will be based on the development track record of the contestants."There is no way Raila Odinga can beat Jubilee which has in only four years initiated many projects which have been felt by the people."CS Eugene Wamalwa (Water), Governor Kenneth Lusaka (Bungoma), MPs Robert Pukose (Endebes), John Waluke (Sirisia), Reginalda Wanyonyi (Women Rep) and Benjamin Washiali (Mumias East) were present.Wamalwa told off Nasa co-principal Musalia Mudavadi for claiming that leaders from western allied to Jubilee were traitors."Why is it that when some of us decide to work with Jubilee, we are branded as traitors while when Musalia worked with retired presidents Daniel Moi and Mwai Kibaki no one branded him as a traitor?""This is a sign of desperation on the part of Musalia since he knows well Nasa is not going anywhere," Wamalwa said.He asked Nasa leaders to tell the people of Western what they did for them when they served in senior positions instead of criticising Jubilee projects in the region.Governor Lusaka told the people of western to review the work of leaders before making informed choices next month.He said leadership is about service delivery and not mere politicking.Waluke said residents of Western Kenya are more enlightened and have decided to support Jubilee because of its development agenda."Our people have been in Opposition for long and have not benefited from it in terms of development. This is why they have embraced Jubilee."The Deputy President told members of the Luhya community that they were better off with the Jubilee Administration compared to NASA.He asked Bungoma county commissioner Joshua Chepchieng to prepare a list of all the integrated IDPs in Mt Elgon who will be resettled in two-weeks time.Ruto also gave out Sh5 million for the upgrading of Kapsokwony primary school."When we are saying we will create factories to create more jobs for our youths, our competitors say they will change the Constitution to give jobs to a few hungry old politicians."He said that Jubilee will establish a factory that will solve the issue of unemployment in Mt Elgon.
