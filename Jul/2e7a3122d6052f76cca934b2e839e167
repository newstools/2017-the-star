The opposition has warned that President Uhuru Kenyatta will be held &ldquo;solely responsible&rdquo; for any security threat to his long-standing rival and NASA flagbearer Raila Odinga.Siaya Senator and NASA legal adviser James Orengo yesterday demanded the government come clean on a &ldquo;sinister&rdquo; plot against Raila and his four co-principals using police officers.He spoke at press conference at NASA&rsquo;s Capitol Hill offices, Nairobi.Orengo said some police trainees have been trailing Raila, his running mate and Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka, ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi, Ford Kenya&rsquo;s Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula and CCM&rsquo;s Isaac Rutto in campaigns.He demanded Uhuru, Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery and Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet tell Kenyans the &ldquo;purpose and mission&rdquo; of 60 AP officers who have been undergoing military training in Katulo, Wajir, under the leadership of a Lt Kimunya and deputised by an unnamed officer from the NIS.&ldquo;Yesterday [Monday], eight of the 60 were released from the fields in Wajir to Nairobi and relocated to Kiambu on unspecified mission,&rdquo; Orengo said.&ldquo;We are particularly concerned that the hurried release of the eight officers to Kiambu on unspecified mission coincided with the release of the programme of Odinga&rsquo;s visit to Kiambu today [yesterday],&rdquo; Orengo said.&nbsp;won&rsquo;t wait to tell the taleThe officers have allegedly been undergoing &ldquo;suspicious training&rdquo; for two months and have been using police vehicles. They allegedly started training at Kahawa Barracks, Kiambu, before relocating to Wajir.Orengo said the officers have been made to surrender their official identification documents and ordered to operate as ordinary civilians, while using equipment from the police force.&ldquo;This makes their mission more sinister. We know from past experience the state has used trained security officers to undertake missions such as participating in ethnic violence, while masquerading as ordinary civilians,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;This makes it easy for the state to disown and dismiss them as ordinary thugs, when caught in the act.We fear Jubilee is hatching a similar plan again with this suspicious training. That scheme seems to be afoot again.&rdquo;Orengo said NASA will not wait to &ldquo;tell the tale&rdquo; after the crime has been committed and they have to raise the red flag for the security of the leaders.He called for an immediate response from the top security chiefs and Uhuru&rsquo;s reassurance of Raila and his co-principals&rsquo; safety.
