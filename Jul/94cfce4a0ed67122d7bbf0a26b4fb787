More than 500 nurses at the Busia County Referral Hospital on Monday held a peaceful demo outside Governor Sospeter Ojaamong&rsquo;s office over their collective bargaining agreement.The countrywide nurses&rsquo; strike entered its fifth week. The nurses accused the national government of remaining silent over the delayed CBA they say was agreed on by the Kenya National Union of Nurses&rsquo; officials and the state. Led by their county union chairman Isaiah Omondi and county executive secretary Juliet Adagala, the medics said the Jubilee government has turned a deaf ear to their pleas.They said President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto are busy campaigning for their reelection while they continue to suffer. &ldquo;The national government has refused to implement the collective bargaining agreement,&rdquo; Omondi said.They vowed to continue with the strike until all their demands are met.&ldquo;We are aggrieved, and so we are calling upon the county government of Busia to find ways of addressing the issue or else we shall not resume duty,&rdquo; Omondi said.On December 14 last year, nurses ended a two-week strike after signing a CBA with the county governments and the Ministry of Health. KNUN secretary general Seth Panyako signed the deal on behalf of the nurses, following talks over the salaries stalemate. &ldquo;Talks on the Collective Bargaining Agreement of 2013 will begin in January,&rdquo; he said.
