Water CS Eugene Wamalwa yesterday said The Northern Water Collector Tunnel project will end shortages in Nairobi and neighboring towns.He said Nairobi needs 750,000 cubic metres of water, but only 500,000 is available, leaving a deficit of 250,000 cubic metres.Wamalwa said the completion of the project collecting water from Murang&rsquo;a county and channeling it to Nairobi will increase supply by 140,000 cubic metres.He said the government has also executed contracts for the construction of an additional two dams in Ruiru and Karemenu in Nyeri county, which together will bring 70,000 cubic metres of water to the metropolitan area, to cater for the remaining deficit.&ldquo;The [construction of the] Northern collector tunnel is progressing well. We believe that by 2018 -2019, we should be getting water into Nairobi,&rdquo; Wamalwa said.He added, &ldquo;Right now already we are almost crossing River Irati. Once we cross that river, Ndakaini will start recharging. After that, we are looking at River Maragua and Gikigie. We believe towards the end of the year going into 2018, we will cross these three rivers.&rdquo; The CS said the projects will bring relief to citizens.Wamalwa spoke at a Nairobi hotel during the World Water Council Conference.He said the government is exploring underground water and harvesting rain water to mitigate the effects of drought. Underground water exploration has started in Turkana and Marsabit counties.&ldquo;We just passed a new law which has created a water harvesting and storage authority for the first time and will be focussing on this as well as launching ground water map in the whole country starting with Turkana where we recently discovered huge underground water aquifers,&rdquo; Wamalwa said.
