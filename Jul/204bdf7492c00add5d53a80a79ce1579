Retired President Daniel Moi&rsquo;s son Philip can now breathe a sigh of relief following a Court of Appeal decision exempting him from paying Sh90 million alimony to his ex-wife.The Court of Appeal last Friday quashed a decision that required him to pay his former wife Rossana Pluda a Sh30 million lump sum as maintenance. Philip had also been ordered by the High Court to buy her a house in an upmarket Nairobi suburb or compensate her Sh60 million.Philip, however, is not off the hook because he will be required to give Pluda Sh150,000 as monthly upkeep.Court of Appeal judges Hannah Okwengu, Daniel Musinga and Gatembu Kairu directed the maintenance case be returned to the High Court for it to determine the matter afresh.The two were married for 22 years and their union was dissolved in 2015, following a vicious legal battle.Court documents show the marriage was solemnised on March 1, 1993. It was dissolved by High Court Judge Luka Kimaru on March 10, 2015 on account of irreconcilable differences. In their legal battle, Pluda accused Philip of cruelty and adultery, while he told the court she had deserted their matrimonial home to live with another man. The two have now been given 30 days to file affidavits in the High Court setting out their means of livelihood, income, expenditure, assets and liabilities supporting evidence.In their decision, Okwengu, Musinga and Kairu said Justice Luka Kimaru, who directed Philip to pay Pluda the maintenance, was entitled to draw an adverse interpretation against the businessman for failing to furnish the court with information regarding his financial status. &ldquo;We are unable to find any evidence to support the conclusion by the judge that Philip embarked on an elaborate scheme of transferring his assets when Pluda commenced divorce proceedings with a view to keep them out of reach,&rdquo; the judges ruled.The three judges further observed that Pluda never tendered any evidence to demonstrate the efforts she had made to secure employment and a livelihood for herself.&ldquo;It is not clear to us the basis upon which the court ordered Philip to purchase a house or pay Sh60 million to Pluda after having ordered him to pay Sh30 million as maintenance. The order for Sh30 million payment presumably had taken into account her rent for accommodation,&rdquo; they held.The judges said they were also not persuaded Philip intended to provide rent in addition to a house when he offered to make a lump sum payment and purchase a house for her.
