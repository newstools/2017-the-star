If you are not at the table, you are on the menu, so said American politician Michael Enzi.Women have continuously been told to fight for their space at the top and &lsquo;lean in&rsquo;, as Facebook chief operations officer Sheryl Sandberg wrote in her debut book, which has become the career bible for many women.Leaning in is a concept politician and social entrepreneur Lindy Wafula lives by. A mantra that has led her to undertake ventures to economically empower women in rural areas.She spoke to the Star about her journey through politics and social entrepreneurship and what she has learnt about women in leadership during the 11 years she has lived in Sweden.BeginningsLindy was brought up in Kaloleni by her father, the late Stanley Wafula, who was the coach of Black Mamba FC, and her mother, the late Domitilla Fwaya, who was the sister to former Kaloleni councillor James Fwaya.Unfortunately, Lindy&rsquo;s parents succumbed to HIV and Aids when she was only 14 years old, and she had to become a breadwinner for her family.Lindy was forced to acquire an entrepreneurial spirit at a young age to sustain herself and her family and get an education.Before she ever ventured into politics and social entrepreneurship, Lindy worked in the media. She studied journalism at the Kenya Institute of Mass Communication and upon graduation, she started a private media school.That was not to last, however, because it was a capital-intensive undertaking,as she needed to buy expensive equipment and she did not have the people to fund the project.The banks did not have much faith in the project and refused to fund it.After this stint failed, Lindy got an opportunity to travel to the Netherlands to work, and while there, she nurtured her public speaking skills and started speaking at conferences.In the process, she met her husband and that is how she ended up moving to Sweden.When Lindy moved to Sweden, she noticed something that seemed to ring true across most Scandinavian countries: women make a significant percentage of the people holding senior positions in government and boards.Women in ParliamentIn Sweden, women make up 45 per cent of the people in Parliament.Lindy asked herself why women back in Kenya were not doing the same.Before Parliament was adjourned, there were 86 women in Parliament: 16 elected MPs, 47 woman representatives, five nominated MPs and 18 nominated senators. Women&rsquo;s representation stood at 21 per cent.In the corporate sector, women in Sweden make up 13 per cent of the leaders. This might sound small, but in Kenya, the figure is nowhere near that. The corporate sphere is an exclusive men&rsquo;s club.Sweden&rsquo;s success in putting women in positions of power in politics inspired Lindy to try her hand at politics. But her climb up the ladder has been a tough one.Lindy first plunged into the world of politics in 2010 during the Makadara MP by-election, but she stood no chance as she faced off against the flamboyant Mike Sonko (who is currently the Nairobi senator), who had loads of cash to splash in his bid for the seat.In 2013, Lindy faced a similar fate when she ran for the seat on the Wiper ticket. She lost to Benson Mutura.This time round, she has been nominated by Wiper for a special seat (gender) at the county assembly.At a point, Lindy supported Reuben Ndolo&rsquo;s bid for the Makadara seat, but that came at a cost.&ldquo;When you support a man in politics, people say all sorts of things. People said Ndolo was sponsoring me. They called me manzi wa Ndolo and abused me,&rdquo; Lindy says.Lindy says it is a tough call for a woman to decide to run for office.&ldquo;When I ran in 2013, I had to have a good number of people to offer me security. Thankfully, there were some good men who volunteered to go around with me and protect me. Women face a lot of intimidation when they run for office.&rdquo;UNGANOMICSLindy says part of the reason she did not run for office this year is because of the tactics used by some aspirants to win over voters.&ldquo;The way aspirants are competing now is just terrible. You will find them distributing unga then demanding votes. It&rsquo;s not about the issues you want to solve, but what you will bribe residents with. It takes a toll on your moral values.&rdquo;In 2013, Lindy spent Sh5 million campaigning, and she says that was not enough, but it was all she could raise. There was also the human capital involved.Lindy is now focused on social entrepreneurship.Social entrepreneurshipLindy runs an organisation called Village Ventures Kenya, which seeks to provide women in rural areas with skills to set up profitable businesses.She has started projects in Makadara, Kwale and Busia that enable women to learn how to communicate efficiently in English and start profitable businesses.Through Worldpulse, a social networking site exclusively for women, Lindy got a group to volunteer to regularly write letters to Kenyan women in the village to help improve their writing and reading skills.Different kind of adult education&ldquo;Sometimes the adult education formula used does not work for people on the ground.You have to understand and resonate with their needs. When you write to someone and they write back, you get excited and want to continue the communication. But with textbook learning, it can feel one-sided, especially for adults.&rdquo;The programme has grown to include a cultural exchange element.Junk into goldAnother project Lindy has gotten involved in is sending used computers back to her vocational training academy in Kenya.In Europe, some citizens throw away gadgets that are still in a fairly decent condition and this gave Lindy the idea of collecting computers and sending them back to Kenya for rural women to use in the centres.Another project Lindy has started is a woman mechanics programme, Lady Mekankika, an idea she borrowed from Sweden.&ldquo;Women in Sweden run garages. There is no reason women in Kenya cannot do the same,&rdquo; she says.The project provides young women with vocational training in mechanics.Lindy&rsquo;s vocational training centre, the Women&rsquo;s Academy, has trained women in beauty, mechanics, catering, event planning and ICT.Lindy says it has not been easy to start and sustain some projects, but her mantra in life is &lsquo;never give up in trying to make a positive change&rsquo;.She says she has faced some biases in Sweden, because &ldquo;some people think Africans are lazy&rdquo;.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t let these biases slow me down. If you think I am a lazy African, I will work hard to show you that your perception is wrong,&rdquo; Lindy says.She has always been industrious. When she first moved to Sweden, she taught Kiswahili lessons and made baskets to make cash before she got a permanent job.Opportunities in technologyLindy is a big advocate for the use of technology. &ldquo;We need to move away from women selling tomatoes under the hot sun. Everything can be made available online now. It&rsquo;s no longer about working 40 hours a week for 40 years then you retire. Look for opportunities,&rdquo; she says.Lindy&rsquo;s work has been recognised and she was listed as one of Africa&rsquo;s Top 25 women in leadership for 2017 in the Amazon&rsquo;s Watch magazine.She has also received an award from the Centre for Economic and Leadership Development.She concludes by saying, &ldquo;It is time for women in Kenya to start a movement where they aim to be movers and shakers in the society.&rdquo;
