The Nakuru government has released more than Sh18 million for construction of a fish processing plant in Naivasha.It is expected to be ready in four months. The plant to be constructed near the Central Landing Beach is expected to address the perennial problem of storage and marketing for the increasing fish production.This comes a week after the Nakuru government and fishermen restocked the lake with close to 70,000 fingerlings.Director of fisheries in the county Mathew Ngila said Sh18.17 million had been allocated to the processing plant.Ngila said Sh8 million had been allocated in the last financial year, while another Sh10 million had been set aside this year.&ldquo;A contractor has been identified and moved to the site. We expect the processing plant to be ready in three to four months,&rdquo; he said.Ngila said once complete, all fishmongers at the Naivasha main bus terminus would be transferred to the plant.&ldquo;We expect fish trade to be conducted in the processing plant and we shall employ a couple of workers to work from there,&rdquo; he said.Ngila said the plant would also have a cold room where excess fish would be stored as the traders sought a market for the catch. Lake Naivasha Boat Owners' Association chairman David Kilo welcomed the processing plant terming it "long overdue".Kilo said due to lack of storage facilities, some traders take advantage of the situation to buy fish at throwaway prices.
