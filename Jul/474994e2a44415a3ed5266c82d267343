Governor David Nkedianye and Kajiado Central MP Elijah Memusi on Tuesday claimed their lives are in danger.Nkedianye and Memusi allege a senior government official sent them a message that they might face &ldquo;elimination&rdquo; because they have become Jubilee&rsquo;s &ldquo;stumbling block&rdquo;.The two recorded statements with the deputy county Directorate of Criminal Investigations officer Daniel Musangi, in Kajiado town.The leaders were accompanied by ODM nominee member of the East African Legislative Assembly Judy Pareno. Memusi told Musangi that the senior official said &ldquo;Jubilee must win all the elective positions Kajiado&rdquo;.&ldquo;The same day I received that message, our Orange House in Kajiado was burnt by arsonists. When you connect the two, what do you make of it?&rdquo; Memusi said.&ldquo;We are here to say we cannot take those threats lightly. We want to know how and what elimination method the state will use to eliminate us in order to win seats in the upcoming elections.&rdquo;Nkedianye demanded that the state come clean over the arson and continuous threats directed at the opposition ahead of the election.&ldquo;We have come here as law-abiding citizens to record statements over those threats. We demand state protection; and note that we are not begging to be protected,&rdquo; Nkedianye said.Memusi, however, did not name names.But Musangi ruled out politics in the arson case, saying investigations revealed that those who burnt the ODM office are &ldquo;people bent on grabbing land on which the office sits&rdquo;.But Nkedianye and Memusi objected to Musangi&rsquo;s reports over the arson, and accused police of being part of the arsonists working with Jubilee to frustrate the opposition. &ldquo;We are not children, and you should address us rightfully over this matter,&rdquo; Memusi said.
