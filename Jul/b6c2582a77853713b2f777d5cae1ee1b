Kisii county commissioner Karanja Njora has asked the IEBC to warn politicians who are using youths to cause mayhem during campaigns. He said supporters of some politicians have been frequently disrupting rivals’ meetings. Njora yesterday urged politicians to ensure their supporters are peaceful ahead of next month’s election. “I will liaise with the IEBC to consider suspending campaigns in the area if supporters of certain politicians continue disrupting their rivals’ meetings,” he said in his office. Njora warned those found violating the law will be arrested and charged. He said incidents of chaos witnessed in Ogembo and Kisii town a week ago, will not be tolerated by security agents. “We know those who orchestrated the chaos and necessary action is being taken against them to deter others,” the commissioner said. Njora said the government is aware some leaders are financing the youth, including boda boda operators, to cause violence. “I’m taking this early opportunity to warn the youth against being used by the politicians for selfish interests,” he said. The government will not allow politicians to incite the youth to violence and tarnish the image of the county, Njora said. During the clash at a Kisii hotel between supporters of rival parties, several youths were arrested, their boda bodas were impounded and taken to the Kisii police station. Njora said suspects will be charged once investigations are complete. The violence has been condemned by leaders, including MPs Joel Onyancha (Bomachoge Borabu), Richard Tong’i (Nyaribari Chache), former CIC chairman Charles Nyachae and others. “We want leaders to sell their policies to voters. Violence is not a solution,” Onyancha said.
