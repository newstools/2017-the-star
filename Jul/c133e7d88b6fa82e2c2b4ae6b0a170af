Ejaculating at least 21 times a month significantly reduces a man's risk of prostate cancer, new research reveals. This is compared to those who release just four-to-seven times every four weeks, a Harvard University study has found.The findings are true regardless of whether men achieve orgasm through masturbation or sex, the research adds.Researchers did not speculate on why ejaculation protects against prostate cancer, however, past research suggests it helps to rid the gland of cancer-causing substances and infections. Ejaculation may also help to ease inflammation, which is a known cause of cancer. How the study was carried out Researchers from Harvard University analyzed 31,925 healthy men who completed a questionnaire about their ejaculation frequency back in 1992. Monthly ejaculation frequency was assessed in men aged 20-to-29, 40-to-49 and the year before the questionnaire was completed. Ejaculation was defined broadly and could be as a result of sex or masturbation. The men were then followed until 2010. Some 3,839 of the study's participants were diagnosed with prostate cancer during the investigation. Key findingsResults revealed that ejaculating at least 21 times a month significantly reduces the risk of prostate cancer in men aged 20-to-29 and 40-to-49.This is compared to ejaculating just four-to-seven times a month.The researchers wrote: "We found that men reporting higher compared to lower ejaculatory frequency in adulthood were less likely to be subsequently diagnosed with prostate cancer."The findings were published in the journal European Urology.How does ejaculation reduce a man's cancer risk? The researchers did not speculate on why ejaculation helps to ward off prostate cancer.Yet, past research by the same university suggests that emptying the prostate of cancer-causing substances and infections may have some benefit. Ejaculation may also help to reduce prostate inflammation, which is a known cause of the cancer.
