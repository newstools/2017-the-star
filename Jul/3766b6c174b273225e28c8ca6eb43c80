Workers of the Nairobi Water and Sewerage Company have boycotted work claiming there is a plot by the county government to privatise the state corporation.The workers for the third day held demos at the main offices in the industrial area, citing political interference in the firm&rsquo;s management.The Kenya County Government Workers Union branch secretary Matilda Kimetto said the NWSC board has terminated contracts of two &ldquo;performing directors to destabilise the firm, and use it as an excuse to privatise the organisation.&rdquo;&ldquo;We are picketing because of the political interference with the organisation. We are opposed to unwarranted termination of contracts,&rdquo; she said.The board did not renew contracts of Steven Mbugua (commercial director) and Johnston Ngandu (financial director), which expired this month, leading to the go slow.&ldquo;We are in a vehicle that is being driven carelessly and recklessly, and we are saying we will wait for an accident to happen,&rdquo; Kimetto said.But yesterday, Water executive Peter Kimori denied claims the county government wants to privatise the organisation.&ldquo;A few staff have been demonstrating saying that we want to sell the company, but I informed them that those were rumours. It is just politics,&rdquo; Kimori said.On Thursday, county assembly minority leader Abdi Guyo also claimed, in the chamber, that there were plans by the executive to sell the company to a French firm.&ldquo;Mr Speaker, I am told told the executive wants to sell Nairobi Water. But I want to state that this assembly will not allow such a thing to happen,&rdquo; Guyo said.Speaker Alex Magelo asked the MCAs to be alert, saying he will recall MCAs for a special sitting if there&rsquo;s truth in the &ldquo;rumours&rdquo;. &ldquo;Nairobi county is the principle shareholder of the company and it cannot be sold without the authority of this House. Let us ascertain facts before we take any action,&rdquo; Magelo said.Concerning the renewal of contracts of the two directors, Kimori said, &ldquo;That is the responsibility of the board, and as a minister, I cannot interfere with their decision.&rdquo;Attempts to reach board&rsquo;s chairman Raphael Nzomo were futile. But NWSC corporate affairs manager Mbaruku Vyakweli said the board&rsquo;s decision is based on the performance of the two. &ldquo;They were on contract, and if the contract expires, it is the decision of the board to review their performance and decide whether or not to renew them. And you cannot appeal that,&rdquo; Vyakweli said on the phone yesterday.Kimetto said the board has been micromanaging the company including, workers&rsquo; welfare.&ldquo;We are disputing the board&rsquo;s move not to renew the contracts of top managers who have brought this company to where it is &ndash; from making Sh60 million to the current Sh800 million,&rdquo; she said.
