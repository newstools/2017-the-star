The National Police Service should match its tough words on electioneering hate speech with even tougher action, as amply provided for in the law.Director general of the Directorate of Criminal Investigation Ndegwa Muhoro is the latest top cop to talk tough against hate speech on the hustings.Opening new county criminal investigations offices in Kericho subcounty, the DCI declared, &ldquo;The law is clear that nobody, regardless of his or her status will . . . go scot-free if found inciting the electorates during the campaigns&rdquo;.Muhoro spoke of the police as being both trained and equipped to bring solid hate-speech cases to the courts.At the same time, he said it is regrettable none of the cases against hate speech mongers had been prosecuted fully, for lack of proper investigations or failure by key witnesses to testify in open court against culprits.With only 35 days to go to Election Day, the police need to put action where their mouth is &ndash; with immediate effect.
