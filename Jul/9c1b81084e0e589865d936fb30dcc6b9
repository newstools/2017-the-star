The woman representative position is just as important as the other elective posts, a Garissa candidate has said. Jubilee woman rep candidate Anab Gure on Wednesday urged residents to elect leaders whose integrity can stand the test of
time. She spoke after she was endorsed by a group of non-locals living in Garissa. “The
creation of the seat was long overdue, especially for the residents of
Northeastern whose women have been locked out of leadership positions
because of culture,” she added. The woman rep position is viewed by Kenyans as of little importance. The situation is
even worse in Northeastern, where women are not considered for elective
leadership position. “I urge
our people, as they go to cast their votes in August 8, to choose candidates
who will have outlined a manifesto that can be implemented for the benefit of
women and youth,” Gure said. Gure was picked by her Abduwak clan and later
by the Telemuge Alliance that brought on board the Samawathal clan under a negotiated democracy deal. She will go up against the incumbent,
Shukran Gure of Wiper, Fatuma Kinsi of ODM, Ebla Sahal of Ford Kenya, Amina
Keinan of Kanu and Marian Sheikh of Thirdway Alliance on August 8. “I will go
out and also seek votes from my rivals' perceived strongholds because I want to
be elected by all the 43 Kenyan tribes,” she said.
