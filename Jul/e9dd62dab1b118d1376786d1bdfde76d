Swamibapa had to use all the arsenal at their disposal before beating a hard-fighting Nairobi Gymkhana with just two wickets as the 2017 NPCA Super League entered the third round on Sunday. While Swamibapa seemed to struggle in their pursuit for 181 at Nairobi Gymkhana, other venues were raining runs with six centuries being scored across three venues. National team skipper Rakep Patel achieved the top score of the runs-filled day when he cracked 200 as Kanbis demolished Ruaraka by 216 runs at Eastleigh High School. Vinod Rabadia added on to his first day century when he scored an unbeaten 108 in the same in inning. Divendra Poriya was not left out on the century’s list scoring 102 runs as Ruaraka made only 227 in pursuit of Kanbis’ 443 runs. Collins Obuya was the man of the match as his 124 led defending champions Stray to 180 run victory over Kongonis. The last ton of the day was scored at Sikh Union, where Gurdeep Singh’s 102 led the home team to 90 runs win over Sir Ali. Chasing a score of 181, Swamibapa were heavily reliant on Mitesh Sangani (46) and Emmanuel Bundi (38) to earn their third successive victory. Things looked dicey for Swamibapa when they lost Alex Obanda and Maurice Ouma in two balls with the board on 32 and were again reduced to 77 for 4 before Sangani and Bundi got lifted them to 156 with a fifth wicket stand of 79. They again lost three quick wickets for 19 runs to bring tension in the dressing room but the lower order held their nerves to secure the victory with 9.5 overs to play. “It was hard fought,” Onyango said. “I think it’s really good that we’ve been in this kind of situation and have come out with a win. I think the more we’re in those situations the more we’re going to learn.” Sijoray Virajut and Rushabh Patel were the anchors of Gymkhana’s final total of 181 with 54 and 56 runs respectively after Swamibapa 30 for 2 and then 74 for 4.
