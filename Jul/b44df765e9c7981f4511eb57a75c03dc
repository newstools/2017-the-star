A school bus crushed a seven year-old pupil to death in Mombasa on Friday after he fell from it. Coast traffic boss Emmanuel Okanda said the child was trying to pick his water bottle and bag which fell through a gap in the floor plate of the bus. Okanda said the driver was arrested and investigations launched. He said they will also question the management of St Augustine Preparatory School.  The gap in the floor of the St Augustine Preparatory School bus through which a pupil fell and was crushed on July 21, 2017. /COURTESY NTSA regretted the incident and said its investigations revealed the "floor plate of the bus was corroded and covered with a PVC carpet". "This points to the fact that the school knowingly concealed this defect in the vehicle,' the authority said in a statement. Director general Francis Meja said the vehicle, registration KBB 939G, was impounded and will undergo a structural inspection. Meja said the school's administration will be charged with endangering lives by failing to maintain its vehicle
