HR will help them make a smooth transition as the changes take effect," he said.The MD added they are in talks with customers whose accounts are domiciled in the past one year in order to redirect them."Customers will have the freedom to choose any branch for their accounts to be hosted."In 2016, Awuori said there were no local, regional or group level plans to shut down Barclays Bank of Kenya.This was after reports that the institution will exit Africa.He was responding to a decision by Barclays PLC chief executive Jes Staley to leave Africa as reported by the Financial Times.The review came after South African President Jacob Zuma decided to change his finance minister at a time when the economy is under severe stress.The board appointed a subcommittee to study how and when to sell Barclays Africa, the Financial Times said.Read: Barclays Kenya is not shutting down - MD Jeremy Awori
