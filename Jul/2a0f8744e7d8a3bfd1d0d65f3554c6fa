Community organizations should use small donor grants for viable, long-term and economically empowering business projects rather than wait for huge chunks of funding grants, a forum has heard.&ldquo;Traditional donors often rely on heavy bureaucratic processes to implement projects. Instead, small grants directly given to community groups can deliver vital social change and contribute to much more sustained and people-focused development,&rdquo; said Jenny Hodgson, director, Gobal Fund for Community Foundations during 20th anniversary celebrations of the Kenya Community Development Foundation in Nairobi.Conference attendants were advised to invest in capacity building for communities to build resilience, ultimately shifting power into their hands to transform their lives economically and socially.&ldquo;They know best what ails them, and what help is needed to overcome these problems,&rdquo; said Janet Mawiyoo, executive director of KCDF.Participants discussed practical, community based case studies of how complex problems including poverty, environment, economic empowerment and social justice can be expanded in Kenya and beyond.
