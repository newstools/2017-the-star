Jamal Washe was shot dead from behind by the prisons officer when he tried to run away after two officers invaded a drug den at Kibaoni stage, Kilifi.Jamal was taking breakfast at a caf&eacute; near the stage. He came out of the caf&eacute; after police officers fired in the air.Speaking in Kilifi yesterday, Madzayo said lawyers are drafting a letter to sue AG Githu Muigai over the shooting.Madzayo said the officer used excessive force in handling the matter.&ldquo;We cannot leave the killing of Jamal like that. After he was shot, Jamal was searched and there was no weapon in his possession. Neither were there illegal drugs in his pockets. The state must give answers to this shooting and that&rsquo;s why by Tuesday we will have sued the AG and IG Joseph Boinett,&rdquo; he said.
