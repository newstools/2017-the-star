President Uhuru Kenyatta yesterday told NASA to sell its agenda to Kenyans, instead of wasting its time in court to derail the August 8 election.He spoke in Kapenguria, West Pokot county. He said it was wrong for the alliance to go to court to bar security forces from protecting polling centres.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the constitutional mandate of security officers to provide security to all Kenyans. We cannot block them from protecting Kenyans,&rdquo; Uhuru said.He said Kenyans have the power to decide who will carry the day.Uhuru said NASA&rsquo;s persistent rigging claims are part of its plans to cause confusion because it is not ready for the polls.He said Parliament is the only institution tasked with passing a motion to bar security officers from performing certain duties.Uhuru said the courts will not decide the winner.&ldquo;The opposition should stop creating constant bottlenecks through their persistent litigation to sabotage the election,&rdquo; he said.Uhuru was accompanied by Deputy President William Ruto in the second leg of their tour of three counties.He started his tour in Laikipia county, where he criticised NASA leaders &ldquo;for constantly engaging in empty rhetoric&rdquo;.Uhuru said the Jubilee administration has made great strides in tackling the problems Kenyans face, including finding solutions to land and security challenges.&ldquo;This county has been marginalised for long. My government has been able to set up colleges, tarmac roads and connect residents to electricity, among many other projects,&rdquo; he said.Uhuru cautioned NASA against engaging in acts that are &ldquo;destroying the social fabric of the Kenyan nation, including inciting ethnic conflict&rdquo;.The head of state promised that the government will take stern action against anyone intending to cause chaos during or after the polls.He said the government will ensure Kenyans vote peacefully.Uhuru drummed up support for Governor Simon Kachapin &ldquo;because he is one of the governors who have helped to ensure devolution is realised&rdquo;.&ldquo;Kachapin has helped open this region and his development record speaks for itself. Vote for him again,&rdquo; he said.Kapenguria MP Samuel Moroto asked him to stop the ongoing operation in Baringo and Laikipia.He said elders should be tasked with uniting the communities because &ldquo;they know why the communities fight.&rdquo;Uhuru was later expected to address a rally in Adugosi, Teso South constituency, Busia county.
