Police in Kijabe have recovered a body suspected to be of a victim of extrajudicial killing in Kinale Forest on the Nairobi-Nakuru highway.The body, of a middle-aged man, did not have any identification documents and had been eaten by wild animals when it was discovered on Tuesday evening.This is the eighth body to be found in the forest since the year began. It is suspected that the men are killed elsewhere and their bodies dumped in the forest. A resident identified as Gitau said the man is not from the area. He said the body may have been in the forest for three days.&ldquo;The man has been dumped around the same area where other bodies were found and police have started their investigations,&rdquo; Gitau said.A senior police officer, who refused to be named, said a postmortem would be carried out to determine the cause of death.Meanwhile, a group of youths who had invaded private land in the volatile area of Maella, Naivasha, has been kicked out and security intensified in the area. The 50 youths had already started to till the idle land, creating tension and anxiety in the agriculture-rich area.Speaking on the phone, Naivasha assistant county commissioner John Opondo accused some politicians of inciting the youths.He warned that anyone who breaks the law will be arrested. Opondo said all landowners in the area have valid title deeds.&ldquo;We have managed to kick out all the youths from private farms and warned them that they face prosecution once arrested,&rdquo; he said.Opondo said the provincial administration and churches have embarked on a major peace campaign across the sub-county ahead of the general election.
