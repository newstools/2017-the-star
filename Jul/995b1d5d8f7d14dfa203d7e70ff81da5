Kenya Simbas skipper Wilson K&rsquo;Opondo will be available for the Africa Gold Cup match against Tunisia on Saturday at the RFUEA ground.K&rsquo;Opondo suffered a rib cartilage injury against Germany in May and missed both ties against Uganda. However, the technical bench is confident he will pass a rigorous training session today and be fit for the must-win clash against the North Africans after an lacklustre start to the season .Kenya lost 30-29 to Germany; beat Uganda 23-18 in Kampala and drew 33-33 with them 3 at the RFUEA ground a fortnight ago. The results has also seen their ranking plummet to 26 from 22 in recent weeks. K&rsquo;Opondo brings leadership and an X-factor, which has been lacking in the team in recent matches. There could be changes to the back-row and at half-back, according to the sources in the team.There has been disquiet in the aftermath of the draw against Uganda in several quarters questioning coach Jerome Paarwater commitment to take the team to the next level.&ldquo; Nowadays Jerome comes to coach the team 24 hours prior to the match contrary to previous years when he used arrived a week before any match,&rdquo; said the source.The team for the past fortnight has been trying to address the weaknesses in the defence which conceded so many missed tackles in the match against Uganda. Assistant coach Dominique Habimana said the players must bring the intensity from the kickoff and can&rsquo;t afford any lapses in concentration &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an area we have looked at in training for the past week and our missed tackles and work-rate must go a notch higher. Tunisia have big pack and we have to win that battle against them up front if we are to come out victorious in that regard,&rdquo; added Habimana. Kenya beat Tunisia 46-15 ion a Africa Cup tie two years ago but Habimana expects a tough contest this time around.
