The focus within the Swiss financial sector was on becoming a &lsquo;clean financial sector&rsquo; rather than a place notorious as a haven for illegally obtained funds; and this involved a policy shift towards transparency.As explained by Ambassador Ralf Heckner, from that point onwards, &ldquo;Switzerland would no longer be a safe haven for the corrupt.&rdquo; The thinking behind this change was not purely altruistic. There was an awareness that the Swiss bank sector could only thrive if Swiss laws created a win-win situation between Switzerland and other nations, and that the country itself could not thrive if it was seen to be a rogue state in the middle of Europe. And it is here that this new Swiss policy becomes of great interest not only to Kenyans, but also to many others in developing nations.MAKING SURE CRIME DOESN&rsquo;T PAYThe Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs, Directorate for International Law, explains the new Swiss policy in a document titled, &ldquo;Making Sure Crime Doesn&rsquo;t Pay: Repatriating the Proceeds of Crimes&rdquo; as follows:&ldquo;Assets illicitly acquired by Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) such as Heads of State and high public officials, who illegally enrich themselves through state funds, deprive their state of capital and hinder the development of their country. These so-called &ldquo;potentate funds&rdquo; are frequently sent out of the country and invested in international financial centres. Switzerland has a fundamental interest in ensuring that assets of criminal origin are not invested in its financial centre&hellip;Assets illicitly acquired by PEPs that manage to enter Switzerland despite comprehensive precautionary measures have to be identified and repatriated to their country of origin.&rdquo;This might seem like mere eyewash, intended to deceive the citizens of those nations that have thus been subjected to the depredations of ruthless dictators, their families and associates. After all, there must have all along been some very specific financial advantages in permitting all those many &ldquo;Swiss numbered bank accounts&rdquo; to be opened within Switzerland. Both the banks and the country must have seen some advantage in it. So why throw away a goose which had evidently been laying golden eggs all this time?Well, such scepticism may have been valid in the early years of this shift towards transparency, but not anymore. Remember, this process started back in the 1980s, and in the 30 years since, much progress has been made, and evidence of the serious intention by the Swiss in this matter has been steadily gathering.Here are two examples from documents provided by the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs:And this is by no means the worst news for those who would seek to hide their ill-gotten funds in Swiss banks.The approach used by the Swiss authorities has since evolved to include anticipatory freezing of funds:&ldquo;During the Arab uprisings of 2011, the Swiss government immediately took proactive measures and ordered the freezing of assets of the former rulers involved and their entourages without waiting for requests for mutual legal assistance from the countries in question. Lacking a specific legal basis to do so, this was undertaken as an emergency measure based on the government's constitutional right to safeguard Switzerland's interests.&rdquo;What all this means is that a modern-day Mobutu or Houphou&euml;t-Boigny, intent on concealing his vast illicit fortune behind the safety of numbered accounts, would have to look elsewhere. As the Swiss Federal Directorate for International Law explains: &ldquo;The strict provisions of Swiss anti-money-laundering legislation oblige Swiss banks and all other financial service providers to identify not only the contracting party, but also the economic beneficiary&hellip;Banks and other financial intermediaries are required by law to report all suspicious transactions and to block immediately any account where there is suspicion of money laundering. Swiss banking secrecy provides no protection against the prosecution of criminal offences either in Switzerland or in the context of international mutual assistance in criminal matters.&rdquo;AND SO, ONTO ANGLO LEASINGOf particular interest in this context is the Anglo-Leasing scandal, currently before the courts here in Kenya, and therefore subject to the &lsquo;sub judice&rsquo; provisions of the law. But what is already in the public domain is that a fabulously wealthy family of Kenyan Asians, the Kamani family, has been accused of playing a central role in this giant scam, and a few of the relatives have already appeared in court to answer charges related to Anglo Leasing.This scandal &ndash; of alleged &ldquo;ghost contracts&rdquo; &ndash; was initiated in the last days of the regime of retired President Daniel arap Moi, but extended into the early years of the Mwai Kibaki presidency (2002-13). It was initially brought to public attention by British High Commissioner Sir Edward Clay, perhaps the most storied foreign diplomat to ever serve in Kenya.In this scandal, public funds were alleged to have been stolen by direct payment for contracts that were never honoured; for goods that were not supplied; at prices that were impossible to justify; and to corporate entities that, basically, were non-existent.Whatever the truth may be in this matter, the established fact is that there is roughly 2.0 million Swiss Francs (Sh206 million) currently held in frozen accounts in Switzerland, which are judged to be the fruits of fraudulent contracting by officers of the government of Kenya, in this matter. If the Kenyan courts were to finally get to the bottom of this matter, it would not only free the Swiss authorities to release &ndash; for use in Kenya &ndash; the sums that are currently in those frozen accounts. Possibly even more important than the money to be refunded, is the signal it would send: It would encourage Kenya&rsquo;s growth as a regional financial hub.There is currently a Bill before Parliament, which is supposed to facilitate the proposed Nairobi International Finance Centre. A final resolution to the Anglo Leasing scandal, through the courts, would demonstrate that the Kenyan financial sector was governed by the rule of law, and not by the arbitrary whims of those who might be temporarily in power.THE QUESTION OF SCALEThe problem, when it comes to repatriation of the proceeds of crime, is one of scale. The Swiss authorities may currently be on standby to send back to Kenya the aforementioned Sh206 million. But by all accounts, that is but a small part of the money Kenya lost in the Anglo-Leasing scam: A very small slice of a very big pie.The US Ambassador to Kenya of the time, Michael Ranneberger, highlighted the magnitude &ndash; and sheer brazenness &ndash; of this type of grand corruption, in a speech he gave in Nairobi back in 2006. The Ambassador emphasized that: &ldquo;Corruption exacts a terrible human and economic cost and is probably the single greatest impediment to economic development and poverty reduction in Kenya.&rdquo;He then went on to speak of the Anglo Leasing scandal, which he said consisted of schemes involving several branches of the government, and which had robbed the Kenyan taxpayer of some $700 million. It should be mentioned though, that not all this money necessarily found its way to Swiss numbered accounts. &ldquo;MORE THAN ALL THE FOREIGN ASSISTANCE&rdquo; These schemes had been designed to siphon off significantly more than that, but were only partially successful: Most were closed after details of their operations were exposed in the media.The Ambassador summed up with these words: &ldquo;To put this number in perspective, that $700 million is more than all the foreign assistance provided to Kenya over the past year by international development banks and (foreign governments) ...It is twice as much as the amount budgeted for health.&rdquo;In this context then, Kenyans can only take limited consolation in the knowledge that 2.0 million Swiss Francs (Sh206 million) held in suspect accounts believed to be related to this scandal, have been frozen by the Swiss authorities.It has now been over 10 years since Kenyans heard of Anglo Leasing, and the broad public consensus has long been that there was a massive fraud involved in these various contracts collectively termed as "Anglo Leasing". Suspects have been in and out of court, but there has been no final determination. And many questions remain unanswered.
