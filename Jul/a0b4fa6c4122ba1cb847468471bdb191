Did the Sh1 million fine against both Bungoma Governor Ken Lusaka and his rival Wycliffe Wangamati by the IEBC’s Electoral Code of Conduct Enforcement Committee scare candidates? Well, there is mass withdrawal of cases by candidates before the Committee. The Committee is surprised at how fast cases are being withdrawn before it. Sources whisper to Corridors most candidates who registered complains with the Commission are now withdrawing their cases after learning from Lusaka's case that even the complainant is not spared either. Last week, a gubernatorial candidate from Nyanza withdrew his case against his rival in a suspicious manner. On Tuesday, the trend continued, with five of the 12 cases before the Committee withdrawn in unclear circumstances. ******** So, how many jobs is President Uhuru Kenyatta planning to dish out to political failures if he wins the August 8 polls? Well, an independent candidate from Central Kenya was heard protesting that Uhuru and Deputy President William Ruto have been duping independents to step down with the promise that they will be given jobs. But the man asked if the thousands of independents can all be accommodated in government at a time when the President himself has thrown his weight behind the SRC drastic cuts of the salaries of the State officers. According to the man, they will not relent and only the people will have the final say. ******** A flamboyant parliamentary candidate from Kericho County is said to be reconsidering his ambition to run for the seat after the Salaries and Remuneration Commission's salary shocker for State officers. The man, who is associated with a former powerful government official, has been spending millions on his campaigns, sure he will compensate himself once he is elected. But the SRC this week slashed the salaries and allowances, with MPs being among the casualties. ******** Did President Uhuru Kenyatta seek to quench his thirst while opening the Senator Keg brewery in Kisumu yesterday? A thirsty President was seen being served with a cup, a drink which he appeared to enjoy, as he sipped slowly. Hundreds of onlookers cheered the Head of State on, telling him to drink more as he launched the multi-billion-shilling brewery. ******** Politics is a dirty game, they say, and true it became exactly that for a flashy politician vying for a parliamentary seat in one of the country’s cities. A close friends was shocked when he sent him a dozen text messages asking for Sh100,000 to enable him to raise money to pay a hefty fine imposed on him by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission over electoral malpractices.
