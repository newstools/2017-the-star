Ford Motor Company yesterday launched Ford Protect in the country, an extended service plan offering maintenance solutions to its customers. The product aimed at shielding Ford customers from exorbitant repair costs, will be free on all name plates with the exception of Ranger Single Cab 4x2 and 4x4 variants. “This offers Ford owners complete peace of mind, an optimal ownership experience and preserves the vehicle’s resale value,” head of Ford operations at CMC Motors Kagwiria Mbiti said. He said that the Ford Protect plan will cater for all service and maintenance costs for a period running between three to five years. The plan covers routine service, parts and labour costs for engine oil and filter changes, multi-point inspections, spark plugs, fuel and air filters, maintenance of parts such as brake pads and linings, shock absorbers, clutch disc, engine belts and hoses, and wiper blades. “What is even more salient for the Ford owner is that the maintenance plan mitigates against inflationary service and maintenance cost increments while the vehicle is covered,” Mbiti said. Ford Protect will be offered at CMC’s eight locations across the country, with servicing and maintenance being performed by Ford certified technicians using only genuine original equipment manufacturer parts. The motoring sector in Kenya has seen several changes, mostly as a result of the dynamic nature of the Kenyan consumer and the regulatory environment,” Mbiti said. Month on month car sales for new vehicles rose marginally by 1.38 per cent to 959 units from 946 units sold in May. Kenya Motor Industry Association said that new vehicle sales have been significantly lower compared to 2016 on what industry players attribute to economic slowdown and jitters over the upcoming general election.
