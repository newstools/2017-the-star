The High Court has quashed a criminal charge against Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya over complaints by the Senate Public Accounts Committee that he failed to appear before it. Justice George Odunga said the charge was without basis, given the governor had been cleared by the county assembly over misuse of public funds. The directive prohibits Director of Public Prosecutions Keriako Tobiko from prosecuting Oparanya. The court held that summons against the county boss by the Senate did not comply with the law. “There was already an order stopping the Senate from effecting its summons against the governor — it disobeyed it,” Odunga said. He said the criminal charge before the chief magistrate’s court stands terminated.
