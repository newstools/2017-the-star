Newborn twins died on Saturday in Wekelekha village, Bungoma South, after their mother was barred from entering her homestead by her father- in-law who called them a badomen. Joseph Wafula told the Star yesterday that for the twins to be allowed home a goat or sheep must be slaughtered by elders and rites performed. He said a ram is usually slaughtered by elders and its dung and blood are smeared on the twins, before they are allowed into the homestead. Wafula said he had told his son it was taboo for twins to be allowed home without rituals, because they would bring bad luck to the whole family. In Bukusu, when the firstborn are twins it is regarded as a bad omen. Lilian Wafula had delivered the twins at a hospital. She has been married and living in the homestead for two years. According to the Bukusu traditions, cleansing rituals should be performed on the infants and the family. After she was barred from her homestead, the mother took refuge outdoors in a nearby maize plantation. The twins died two hours later. It is not clear what caused the death. He said he didn’t want the twins to die, but according to Bukusu tradition, either one of the twins must be killed — or a sacrifice performed so both may grow up to be good children. “This is something we could not risk as it has been done before by our forefathers and is still being done. We could not take chances and let them into this homestead,” Wafula said. He said the children will not be buried in the homestead and if they must be buried there, another ritual must be performed. They must be buried at night. The twins father Charles Wafula, said he had heard of the ritual, but thought it was never carried out these days. He called it tragic that he lost his only children because of outdated traditions. A Bukusu elder in Bungoma town, Watiti Wekesa, told the Star the tradition was strictly observed during the precolonial era, If anyone dared violate it, calamity would befall the family. Due to the introduction of Christianity, the tradition is slowly fading away and is only observed in rural areas. The family is preparing to bury the twins on Wednesday. Bungoma South police boss David Kirui said officers are investigating before deciding who to arrest and charge for the babies deaths. The Bukusus still observe various traditions that some people consider cruel and dangerous.
