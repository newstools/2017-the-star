The accused in the case involving the murder of Kiru Boys High School principal murder case will remain in custody until their bail bond application is determined. Jane Muthoni, the principal’s widow, and Isaac Nganga appeared before High Court judge Joel Ngugi on Wednesday for the hearing of the outcome of their bail application. They were denied bail on November 24 last year over concerns of witness intimidation. Muthoni’s lawyer Francis Njanja in his submissions said the court had ruled the accused would be granted bail after witnesses had recorded their statements. “It is the constitutional right of the accused to be granted bail as she is presumed innocent until proven guilty and the accused is not a flight risk since she has four schoolgoing children,” he said. The bail application will be determined on September 6.
