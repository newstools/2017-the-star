Eldoret politician-cum-farmer Jackson Kibor has accused his estranged second wife Josphine Jepkoech of using delaying tactics to prolong their divorce proceedings after it was adjourned for the twelfth time yesterday. Jepkoech and her lawyer Amos Magut did not show up in court for the hearing. Chief magistrate Charles Obulutsa said he may be forced to close the hearing of the divorce case so the final determination is made. Kibor, through his lawyers Mark Waziri and Richard Wainaina, said he was fed up of the unnecessary adjournments. “We have reason to believe that they are not in court again as part of the delaying tactics they are using to ensure this matter does not conclude as soon as possible,” Waziri said. He said all hearing dates are agreed on by both parties, but Josphine and her lawyer keep seeking adjournments on flimsy grounds. Waziri said despite Kibor being a senior citizen, he always honours court dates because he wants the matter concluded. “The frequent adjournments always work in their favour,” he said. Waziri asked Obulutsa to give a verdict. The court was told Magut had lost his grandmother and could not attend court. However, lawyer Fortunatus Mwaka stood in for Magut and pleaded for a final adjournment. Waziri accused Magut of taking the matter lightly and failing to inform the court about his absence using the right procedures. Obulutsa granted the adjournment but warned that it was the final one and ordered that the matter be heard on July 26. “I will give them one more chance,” Obulutsa said. Jepkoech will conclude her testimony and the court will listen to one of her daughters who opposes the divorce. Kibor was married to Jekpkoech for 51 years. Kibor said, “I want this case to end quickly so I can go on with other things.” Kibor denied he wanted to divorce his wife because she had blocked his bid to sell off a 200-acre farm.
