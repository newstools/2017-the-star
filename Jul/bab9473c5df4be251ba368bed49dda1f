Top handicapped player James Murray yesterday led Sandstorm to win their opening match to stay on course for their Overseas Motor Trade Bowl Trophy (Main Cup) campaign at the Nairobi Polo Club yesterday.Murray alongside zero goalers Omwakwe Arungah and Rowena Stichbury, and Izzy Stichbury (-1) beat Faraji, made up of two goalers Raphael Nzomo and Vishal Somaia, Eugene Yumbya (0.5) and Charlie Morlie, -1) 4.5-3.The victory saw Sandstorm proceed to the contest for the Main Cup alongside Samsung Note who beat Mombasa Island Cargo Terminal 4-2. Faraji and MICT now drop to the subsidiary category to vie for The Welby Cup.Despite Nzomo steaming down the goal-area from mid-pitch and drawing the first blood, Faraji let go their lead. Murray lived to the billing and replied two minutes later to take a fraction&rsquo;s advantage. After the low-scoring first chukka, Sandstorm garnered two goals through Murray who converted two of the four penalty shots awarded to his team for a 3.5-1 lead.Morley took a calculated backhand swing to intercept Omwakwe&rsquo;s shot towards their goal-area and Somaia hit in the ball from midfield, reducing the margin to 3.5-2 for Faraji in the third session. The last chukka was marked with some dramatic defensive moves from both teams, and each team managed to score one apiece through Nzomo and Murray.In the second tie, Samsung Note (Martin Waiganjo 2.5, Mike Dutoit 1, Chloe Spoerry 0.5 and Nicola Jensen 0) led MICT (Philip Arungah 2, Domminic Grammaticas 1, Tony Sugden 1 and Arnold Lustman 0 ) from start to end. Mike du Toit scored the first goal for Samsung Note in the opening chukka as Spoerry added one in the second session, all without response by the Arungah-captained side.Waiganjo continued to inflict misery to MICT when he netted Samsung Note&rsquo;s third goal in the penultimate period. However, MICT got some relief when Domminic Grammaticas slotted in their first goal (3-1) in this chukka. It was a give-and-take affair in the fourth chukka as Spoerry scored the winners&rsquo; last and Jensen for MICT.
