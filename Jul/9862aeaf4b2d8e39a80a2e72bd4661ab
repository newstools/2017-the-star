The UhuRuto Express team has warned the Presidents supporters not to drink alcohol in the days leading to the general election. “On August 8 I want all those who operate bars not to sell alcohol. One day will not make you poor,” Gilgil MP Mathenge Nderitu said at Njabini, Kinangop, on Thursday. He said NASA plans to drug illicit alcohol in Jubilee strongholds, hence the recent debate to legalise chang’aa and busaa. “They want to bring drugged alcohol such when you drink you sleep for two days. They have panicked and that is why they plan this evil. Please, if you love Uhuru, don’t drink during election time,” Nderitu said at Ndunyu Njeru. His views were echoed by Ruiru MP Esther Gathogo and popular Kikuyu musician John De Mathew. “If someone becomes too generous days to the election such that he buys for you a bottle after another, be careful. We want everyone to be sober to vote,” Nderitu said.
