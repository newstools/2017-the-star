Tears roll down the cheeks of 25-year-old Irene Jeruto from Tenges, Baringo county, while she recalls how her late beloved father was stoned and burned to death during the 2008 post-election violence.She was barely 16 years when she accompanied her late father Charles Keitany to Mary Mount Secondary School in Nakuru on January 21, 2008.In a statement written by Jeruto and seen by the Star in their home in Tenges, Baringo Central subcounty, on Saturday, schools opened on January 14, 2008, and the girl student was already a week late."On January 21, 2008, while at home, my father received a phone call from one Mr Richard, my class teacher, asking of my whereabouts. "He then informed my dad that I was late for school as I was the only student who had not reported," read part of her statement.Amid the conversation, she said the teacher assured her father that everything had settled after the election violence, and that the road looked calm and normal. Her father accepted and promised him (teacher) that he could accompany me to school the following day."On January 22, 2008, I left for school with my father after breakfast and a family prayer at 8am, and then we drove in my father's pickup KZT833 Chevrolet."She said they made a stopover in Eldama-Ravine so her father, who was then working with the Water ministry, could seek a day-off to accompany her to school. "I also did my shopping, enough for the entire first term, as I was headed to join form two," Jeruto said.She said her class teacher kept calling her father to inquire where they had reached, adding that the traffic on the road was low. They encountered only about three vehicles from Mukutano junction on the Nakuru-Eldoret highway heading to Molo.DEATH IN MOLO TOWNThe town seemed deserted and quiet. There was minimal activity, with few shops operational. Then we entered one petrol station to fuel our vehicle.She said while they were at the filling station, some people came to inspect the vehicle and left talking in low tones.Immediately afterwards, another group appeared with similar moves before we noticed road blocks of heavy stones in front and behind us.That her father attempted to drive away but he couldn't make it past the swelling crowd that had already surrounded them (both men and women).In the process, she said one youth snatched the keys out of their vehicle while her father pleaded to the young man to surrender back the keys.Instead, the boy threw the keys on the ground and ordered my father to collect them on his own.Upon sensing danger, she said her father called her class teacher Mr Kariuki to inform him that they were already in Molo town and the road had been blocked, asking him to come and pick them.But then on his reply, the teacher told him to wait for 10 minutes. "Meanwhile, the group had regrouped into small gatherings and seemed to engage themselves in serious talks," Jeruto said.She said within a few minutes, the group surrounded their vehicle, then one of them ordered her father to lower the windscreen from his side before slapping him hard."I was seated at the rear seat of the vehicle, so I could see everything done to my father," she said.The girl further narrates that her father tried to speed off but the crowd rained stones, breaking all the windows."Then my father got out of the vehicle, trying to plead with them but was not listened to... I also chipped in to plead with them not to hurt my father, but they shouted me down by asking me whether it was my father or myself who voted. It is then that they started beating and throwing stones at him, blood oozing from all over his body as I watched helplessly," she said.She said while she was inside the vehicle, a certain woman from the crowd snatched the phone from her while she was trying to reach for anyone she could get online to come and rescue her father."It is then that two men entered the vehicle and pushed me to the centre. They struggled to tear my clothes, which I resisted so hard."Some women screamed and pleaded with them to let me go," she said, pausing to wipe tears.She said the rowdy youth rushed in with a four litre jerrican full of petrol and poured it on the bonnet of the vehicle, while others were busy disconnecting things from the front, before setting it ablaze."Police arrived, I don't know from where, and they pulled me out of the vehicle and drew me inside their land rover, while our vehicle was already raging with fire," she said.Jeruto said the police made a stopover where her father was lying. "I jumped to lean on him, touching him and crying for help as blood oozed profusely from his head. He was still conscious but not talking anymore. I screamed," she said.She said a Red Cross vehicle stopped a few metres from where they were and she pleaded with them to help, but was shocked when one of the officials retorted, "What did you come to do here?""Before we left, I saw some people pour petrol on my father, then I pleaded with the police to stop them but nothing was done to help my father," she said.She said she found herself in Mau Summit police station, where she was helped into a room by a police officer who gave her a basin and bath water. She also changed into another pair of school uniform.She said the same officer gave her a ride in his private vehicle to Nakuru town, where she boarded a matatu back home, though she later learned that her loving father had succumbed to extreme burn injuries.She said she later transferred from the school and joined Sacho High School, where she completed her learning while still traumatised by what happened to her father.PLEA FOR PEACEDuring a visit by the media to her home in Tenges, Baringo Central, on Saturday, Jeruto and her mother Milka Keitany recalled the incident like yesterday, saying it is hard to get out of their minds.They pleaded with Kenyans to uphold peace as the county approaches the August 8 elections.She said they since they lost a father and a husband who acted as the sole breadwinner, their family has never been the same again."I am a peasant farmer and I have been left alone struggling to raise my children. Some have completed up to college but they have stagnated without jobs," she said.Keitany said their push for compensation from the government has hit a wall.The widow said their incident was marked among the top critical cases in Kenya in connection with the 2007-08 post-election violence, but they are yet to be slotted for any compensation or recognised like other victims. She is among the thousands of other victims of the 2007-08 post-poll violence, many of whom are still in Internally Displaced Persons camps across the Rift Valley, among them in Mogotio, Elama-Ravine (Maji Mazuri), Timborua, Uasin-Gishu and Trans-Nzoia.&ldquo;We were also approached by some people and told to join them in the IDP camps but I refused and decided to fight for my children at home because I understand my problem might not be their problem,&rdquo; she said.Last year in October, the Star reported some 4,000 IDPs (Kikuyu and Tugen) currently living as squatters in Eldama-Ravine without receiving any help from the government.President Uhuru Kenyatta last year announced that the government has totally covered for the 2008 post-election violence IDPs, saying the government has already released Sh6 billion to compensate and purchase alternative parcels of land to resettle them. Uhuru expressed that the government's commitment to compensate all the victims of violence, whether living in the temporary camps or suffering in their homes.&ldquo;My government is committed to compensate and ensure all the IDPS are resettled,&rdquo; he said. However, the victims are still crying foul that Sh4 billion of the Sh6 billion promised is still missing, and they demand a proper explanation from the government.Some 2,000 IDPs in Uasin Gishu were issued with Sh450,000 each, and the government constructed them three-roomed iron sheet-roofed houses, though thousands in other regions like Trans Nzoia and Baringo are still crying that they have been left out.The victims now want Uhuru to speak out and give proper direction concerning the matter. &ldquo;We also want to be recognised and integrated in Baringo and given the same treatment, including compensation, like any other post-election IDPs in this country,&rdquo; said the late Maji-Mazuri MCA Peter Kagathi.On Saturday, Tenges MCA Solomon Cheptai appealed to the government to compensate Jeruto's family among several other victims of post-election violence in Baringo county.He further urged the IEBC to carry out free, fair and transparent elections to prevent election disputes that might stir similar chaos. "We also urge the people to maintain peace as the country enters elections in August. Let us say no to the bad things that have happened previously," he said.The family is among some more than 5,000 people displaced from Nakuru, Njoro, Maji-Mazuri and Naivasha during the during the 2008 election violence. SECURITY MEASURESThe government has deployed more than 500 National Police Reservists (NPR) to beef up security in the North Rift region ahead of the election.Rift Valley regional coordinator Wanyama Musiambo said the NPR will assist with the Kenya Defence Forces, regular police and Administration Police to ensure peace prevails during the electioneering period to avert a reoccurrence of the 2007-08 post-election violence."We have so far tried as security team to contain the runaway insecurity in the region, and the remaining part is only to maintain peace and order," he said.Musiambo was addressing the public during a peace meeting in Marigat, Baringo South, on Saturday last week.The meeting was also attended by chiefs, elders and locals from the insecurity prone areas.Musiambo said the government recruited 151 NPR in Baringo North, 142 in South and 240 in Marakwet East and West.He said this was done after Uhuru declared the areas insecure and 'disturbed' in March."We have now gone ahead to confirm and absorb the NPR so that they assist in beefing up security during and after the election," he said, urging the residents to maintain peace and order during and after the election.He added that the KPR recruits have already presented their particulars and they will be taken through police training in bits so they will render services of trained officers. He was backed by Baringo county commissioner Peter Okwanyo, who cautioned chiefs that they risk losing their jobs and getting arrested if they harbour criminals, especially the armed bandits who plan to cause insecurity and attacks during the August election.This comes amid an ongoing security operation to flush out armed bandits in Baringo, Elgeyo Marakwet and Laikipia counties.Over 30,000 victims were displaced and are currently living in IDP camps in Chapin, Kapkomon, Sibilo,Kampi ya Samaki, Moinonin and Chemoe in Baringo North, Nyimbei, Mochongoi, Karne, Eldume in Marigat, Tangulbei and Kaptuiya in Tiaty subcounty.Musiambo urged the residents to maintain calm, assuring them that there will be a peaceful election.He also asked teachers in the affected schools to resume teaching, saying at least five NPR have been deployed to man the schools.
