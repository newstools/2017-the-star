Developers of the new school curriculum are collating feedback on the success of the ongoing pilot project ahead of its implementation in January.Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development Director, Julius Juan, said the results from the monitoring and evaluation exercise would come in handy in enriching the content and guide publishers on the kind of learning materials required next year.&ldquo;The new curriculum is competency-based, and not emphasising on examinations,&rdquo; he said in a statement.The curriculum experts, mainly from KICD, are on a fact-finding mission that entails monitoring how the teachers in the pilot schools are interacting with learners. The experts have visited 22 counties and the final evaluation will be undertaken in third term. The proposed 2-6-3-3 education system is expected to churn out learners, who are equipped with requisite skills and knowledge to create jobs. KICD chairperson Sara Ruto sought to allay fears that the changes are being undertaken in a rush.
