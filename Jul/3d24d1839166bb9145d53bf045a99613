The government has set aside Sh1.2 billion to tarmac the Siaya-Rwambwa-Ukwala-Ugunja road in Siaya county. Kenha director general Peter Mudinia said the 28-km road will connect Siaya to the Western region and should be completed in two-and-a-half years. Contractor Covec is already on the ground. Speaking in Ukwala on Saturday after inspecting the road, Mudinia said the project is one of Jubilee’s flagship projects. The inspection comes ahead of President Uhuru Kenyatta’s planned visit at the end of the month. Mudiani said illegal bumps erected on major roads should demolished. A circular has been issued to regional managers to enforce the directive, adding they lead to accidents.
