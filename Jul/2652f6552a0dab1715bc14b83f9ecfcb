Police are looking for a car associated with Charles Njagua, popularly known as Jaguar, following an accident in South B last week. A person driving the Starehe Jubilee MP candidate's vehicle reportedly hit Rose Masoni's car on July 11 and then sped off. The case was reported at Industrial Area police station under OB/41/13/7/2017. It was reported that the vehicle was of registration number KBX 779 Masoni complained that her car was hit by the politician's vehicle while on a campaign trail, saying the driver was on phone at the time. "The occupants of the car alighted holding walkie-talkies. They immediately jumped back into their vehicle and drove off claiming they were busy." A police officer handling the case said they had summoned Jaguar but that he has neither responded nor gone to meet them. The politician is yet to respond to calls and text messages on whether he owns the car or if he has been summoned over the accident. On March 24, the DPP ordered a thorough probe into accident cover-up claims involving Jaguar. His Range Rover Sport, KCB 808J, hit two men who were on a motorcycle on March 21. Joseph Maingi and Mugo Abdalla died at the scene of the accident along Makutano-Sagana highway. Read more: Tobiko directs DCI to probe Jaguar accident 'cover-up'
