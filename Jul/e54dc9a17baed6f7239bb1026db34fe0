NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga's dark past has come to haunt him &ndash; in the form of violence during a rally in Rarieda last Monday, JP's Raphael Tuju has said. The Jubilee secretary general said Raila branded him a traitor during his tenure as Rarieda MP and Foreign Affairs minister. &ldquo;You used to pelt me with stones after they branded me a traitor against the Luo community. What then happened to the point that he was pelted with stones?&rdquo; Tuju asked.He was speaking on Saturday at Arram, during the burial of David Odongo, brother of former Kenya Pipeline MD George Okungu.Tuju said he tried to initiate projects to alleviate suffering but was blocked by "Odingaism".&ldquo;Oburu still drinks my water which he frequently sends a pick up to collect the commodity,&rdquo; he said.
