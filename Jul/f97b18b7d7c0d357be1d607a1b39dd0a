Weeks afterÂ Kiss FM's breakfast host announced her engagement, her pals threw a luxurious bridal shower for her, this past weekend. She announced the big news in a quirky fashion. The radio queen posted a photo of herself winking cheekily at the camera holding a mug. The mug read: "Does this ring make me look engaged?" Speaking to Word is, Adelle said, "Love should be celebrated just as loudly as we "celebrate" hate. Also we've enjoyed it with our family and friends for a long while so it's OK for everyone else to know now." She explained that the reason for announcing her engagement in this fashion is because"I hardly do anything in a normal fashion." For the fans who are asking when the wedding is for, Adelle said, "When I know, you'll know." The social actvist said she did not intentionally keep her engagement secret. "It wasn't a secret, I never hid my ring. I just didn't make it seem like all there was to me - and I genuinely wanted to enjoy it in the confines of my family." The radio queen is remaining mum about her big day.
