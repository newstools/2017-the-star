Kisumu county Jubilee Party chairman Zuberi Liete yesterday commended Kiambu residents for giving NASA presidential flagbearer Raila Odinga a rousing welcome on Tuesday.He said this shows the residents in President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s home turf are democratic. &ldquo;We want residents in Nyanza to copy the democratic way the Kiambu residents have done and welcome Uhuru in his vote-hunting mission,&rdquo; Liete said. Speaking to the Star on the phone, he urged Uhuru to visit Raila's turf. &ldquo;He should show democracy and visit the counties in Nyanza. Uhuru should see how his backyard received the opposition leader during his campaign,&rdquo; Liete said.He said every presidential candidate should be allowed to sell his policies to Kenyans without being heckled or attacked.&ldquo;As the incumbent, he requires votes from every part of the country for his reelection. He therefore needs to campaign in all the 47 counties,&rdquo; the chairman said.Raila said the lives of Kiambu residents will improve under his leadership and urged them to vote for him.
