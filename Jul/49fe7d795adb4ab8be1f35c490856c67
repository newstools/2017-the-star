The people of Kiambu county, epicentre of the ruling Jubilee Party, should be commended for the warm welcome they accorded opposition NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga yesterday.They turned out in large numbers and they listened with rapt attention to what he had to say by way of seeking some of their votes, come August 8.A fortnight from now, President Uhuru Kenyatta will also venture into Nyanza, the NASA epicentre, and seek votes there too.It is fitting that the two main contenders should go into what is to all intents and purposes lion&rsquo;s den territory and argue their cases.Such forays are sure signs of a functioning democracy, and of the democratic principle contained in the phrase attributed to Voltaire, &ldquo;I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it".Wouldn&rsquo;t it be grand, and take Kenyan democratic practice to the next level, if Uhuru and Raila were to make joint campaign appearances in their respective lion&rsquo;s den territories?
