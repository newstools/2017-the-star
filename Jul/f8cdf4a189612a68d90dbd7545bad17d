The High Court ruling that the Senate has no powers to summon governors has sounded the death knell for the House, Deputy Speaker Kembi Gitura said on Friday.The Senate is supposed to monitor, oversight and support counties. Gitura said in Mombasa that an appeal must be lodged at the Supreme Court to overturn the decision by judge George Odunga.He said &ldquo;dark forces&rdquo;, including other arms of government, have been fighting to usurp the powers of the Senate to take Kenya back to the &ldquo;dreaded days&rdquo;.Odunga&rsquo;s ruling was reversal of the court&rsquo;s 2015 decision that governors are accountable to the Senate on the use of money allocated to counties.Later, a three-judge bench of Odunga, Isaac Lenaola and Mumbi Ngugi ruled that governors, as county chief executive officers, can be summoned by the Senate when it is probing use of allocated funds..A number of governors have been summoned by the Senate Public Accounts Committee to explain problems and spending irregularities uncovered in audits. Some have complied, appeared and cleared up questions.Others have refused.Gitura addressed the Senate leadership retreat with Kenya Editors Guild.The Deputy Speaker said it beats logic for a single judge to rescind a collective decision made by 67 senators.In one instance, the High Court barred implementation of the Senate decision to impeach Embu Governor Martin Wambora. Consequently, it suspended the swearing in of Deputy Governor Dorothy Nditi as governor.The court said Wambora was impeached by both the MCAs and the Senate, despite a court order stopping the process.Senate Deputy minority leader Abdirahman Hassan said the House is being undermined by &ldquo;dark forces&rdquo;. He also said the court stopped the operation of the County Development Forum.This gave room for pilferage of resources by governors who pushed for programmes that were not essential, Hassan said. &ldquo;The worst of it is the Senate now cannot summon governors,&rdquo; he added.Gitura wants the Senate to have resources for outreach programmes, inspecting projects and holding barazas.&ldquo;The National Assembly refused to give us funds for this. Governors were behind the denial,&rdquo; he said.Mombasa Senator Hassan Omar said the House status must be respected and its decision be final. This is what NASA is championing, he added.The National Assembly has been on the spot for undermining the Senate. The Houses are competing, not cooperating.
