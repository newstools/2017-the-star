IEBC should prioritise biometric identification of voters as a primary mechanism on August 8, the audit firm says in its report.The auditors said this will go a long way in mitigating the risk of data of unregistered deceased persons finding their way in the voters roll.KPMG, after analysing the voter register, noted there are 92,277 records of deceased persons with a matching ID and names in the roll.It, however, said there are over 2 million entries of dead voters as IEBC could not have obtained all the information on registered deaths since 2012.Read: Over one million dead voters could be in IEBC register, KPMG says in audit reportThe company in its report pointed out critical issues that the electoral commission IEBC was to urgently handle before the slated election.For instance, KPMG said they observed two active default administrator accounts whose passwords have not been changed.This to them significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to the register of voters.Further, they said by using these accounts, a perpetrator can add, delete or amend a voter's details in the register.KPMG also observed that audit logs for monitoring super-user activity on the register of voters' database have not been activated.Also, parameters that enable system administrators to change audit trails are enabled for all super user accounts in the database."We were informed that the system administrators review each other on an ad hoc basis. However, there was no evidence of the system administrators reviews."As such, the report said a risk persists that changes made to the register at the database level could go undetected.KPMG said it was not provided with an operations continuity plan or an organisation-wide Business Continuity Plan.It is this plan that IEBC would execute in the event of a disaster to ensure continuity of critical operations.The firm said lack of a business continuity plan would adversely impact the availability of the voters' roll.It also noted that the Commission does not have an established disaster recovery (DR) site."As such, there is no secondary environment where operations including hosting and access to the biometric voter register database and related infrastructure can resume in the event of failure of ICT equipment and infrastructure which hosts the register at the head office.""Whilst we understand the Commission is in the process of procuring a co-location site and new IT infrastructure, in the event of failure of systems prior to the establishment of a secondary production environment, this could represent a significant risk to the preparation for or during the elections in August 2017," the report said.KPMG further noted that IEBC carries out backups of the register in backup tapes.It revealed that there are no detached premises where these backups can be restored and tested."In the event that backup tapes were to be destroyed at head office, the Commissions ability to recover critical voter registration data will be impaired.""We are not aware of the restoration of these backup tapes in any environment," KPMG said.Also read: NASA raps KPMG for 'shoddy' audit, wants IEBC to publish list of dead votersIt said the data center in which the register is maintained lacks critical environmental controls. This increases the likelihood of incidences or a disaster.KPMG observed that the uninterrupted power supply (UPS) system had one (out of three) of the batteries with a faulty alert.Also, the data center's fire alarm and suppression system was faulty and, at the time of the review, had not been serviced since 18 September 2015.In the course of the audit, it was noted that the air conditioning system in the data center failed with temperatures recorded in excess of 25 degrees."This has an adverse impact on server operations and critical processes," KPMG said.
