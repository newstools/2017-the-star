Safina party director of elections John Wamagata has said some IEBC employees are Jubilee Party moles . They are conspiring to have Jubilee candidates cleared, he said. Wamagata is also a candidate for Nairobi senator seat. He spoke in Kiambu town on Thursday. Wamagata said aspirant for Kikuyu MP seat, Paul Wandere, running on the Safina ticket, was locked out by the IEBC. The reason cited was that he did not present his papers on time. “The party aspirant for Kikuyu and the residents were denied their democratic right since the aspirant had reached on time. “He was denied the chance yet he arrived on time,” Wamagata said. The IEBC has declared the incumbent Kikuyu MP Kimani Ichungwa of Jubilee Party as the winner of the seat since he is unopposed.
