Murang&rsquo;a Governor Mwangi Wairia has said he will hold a meeting today with residents to address high water tariffs being charged by the Murang&rsquo;a Water and Services Company. He asked the management of Muwasco to ensure it attends the forum to explain why their charges are high.The company has suffered losses since 2013, with its managing director Daniel Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a claiming the firm has loans amounting to Sh1.2 billion, which it services with Sh2 million per month.&ldquo;For a long time, the people of Murang&rsquo;a have been paying higher water charges than other bigger towns yet water comes from nearby rivers,&rdquo; Wairia said.Speaking to the Star, the governor said he has received numerous complaints from residents over the high water charges, and he plans to find a solution to the problem. Wairia said most residents cannot afford the minimum Sh545 monthly charges, yet water is a basic need.&ldquo;We need the company to explain why we are charged such exorbitant charges and to know what the company does with that money,&rdquo; Wairia said. He questioned why Muwasco charges a reconnection fee of Sh1,000.Muwasco MD, Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a, has in the past said the company needs subsidies from the county government to be able to cut the charges.&ldquo;If we reduce the charges, we will reduce our revenue collection and consequently jeopardise our loan repayment plan,&rdquo; Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a said.The loan, he says, was borrowed from the ADB Bank through the Tana Water Services Board to finance the Kiawambeu Bulk Water Supply project that supplies water to Murang&rsquo;a town and its environs.Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a said Muwasco has been working round the clock to provide efficient services to about 100,000 Murang&rsquo;a customers.
