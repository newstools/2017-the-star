National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale has said the audited voter register shows Jubilee Party has the numbers to guarantee President Uhuru Kenyatta a landslide victory in the August 8 polls. Addressing residents of Bula Iftin during a rally on Saturday, Duale (pictured) said JP leads with 14 million voters, while NASA trails with 5.7 million. He took issue with the Ten Million Strong that NASA purports to have, saying the alliance is “daydreaming”. “How they wish they had such numbers. If they had them, Jubilee would have lost. That is why they are preparing their supporters psychologically so that in the event they lose, then will say that they were rigged out,” Duale said. He said the 2017 voting pattern will differ from that of 2013, adding that Jubilee has eaten into the perceived NASA strongholds. The Garissa Township MP further said NASA “has no moral authority to lecture Jubilee and the people of Kenya on corruption” because the alliance is being bankrolled by corrupt individuals. He did not, however, name them. “The one who dines with Raila Odinga is the same person who leads the biggest corruption cartels in the Republic of Kenya, both in the Moi and Kibaki governments,” Duale said. NASA has, however, dismissed these claims. It said its leaders are in a much better position to fight corruption if elected. They described Deputy President William Ruto as the “high priest of corruption”. Duale urged the people from the pastoralist counties to vote for Uhuru, saying he has done a lot for them in the four years he has been in power.
