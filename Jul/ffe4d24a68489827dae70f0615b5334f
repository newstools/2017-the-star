The IEBC is unable to recruit 50 election staff to work in Lamu county terror-prone areas. The electoral agency officials in Lamu said they are facing challenges recruiting election staff to work in Basuba and Kiunga wards in Lamu East. Other areas are Bargoni in Hindi ward of Lamu West subcounty. With only 17 days to the August 8 General Election, the officials say they still have more than 50 vacancies that need to be filled up. They are mostly those ofÂ  polling clerks, presiding officers and deputy presiding officers. On Thursday, Lamu East constituency returning officer Japheth Omar said many of those who had applied for the posts did not turn up for interviews. He said Basuba is the worst-hit by the shortage, since no one is willing to work in the area and 30 vacancies are yet to be filled. Lamu West returning officer Abdalla Mwaruwa said they are unable to get election staff in Bargoni. The county has 69,776 registered voters and 167 polling stations.
