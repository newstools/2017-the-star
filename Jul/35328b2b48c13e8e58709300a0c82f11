A group of women from Nyeri has protested against the inclusion on outsiders in the Jubilee county assembly nomination list. They said some of the 45 nominees are from Laikipia, Kiambu, Nairobi and Nyandarua counties.&ldquo;Others are non-Jubilee members. Others applicants nominated in different categories, while some never applied but are in the shortlisted list," the women complained in the statement read by Grace Michuki. "Some civil servants who are still in office but are actively participating in politics, including nurses, teachers and a secondary school principal are also in the list.&rdquo; Michuki and Margaret Nyathogora said the wife of the Nyeri branch secretary, who is also the personal assistant of an independent governor candidate, has also been nominated.
