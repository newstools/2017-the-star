Deputy President William Ruto faces yet another political crisis in his Rift Valley backyard where some allies are angry over the list of those to be nominated by Jubilee.More than 400 Jubilee aspirants who lost during the April primaries in Uasin Gishu say they will challenge the list in court. They also plan to demonstrate in Eldoret tomorrow, ahead of President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s visit on Friday. The list has sparked anger from some Jubilee politicians in Uasin Gishu, Nandi, Trans Nzoia and Elgeyo Marakwet counties, where there are claims that cronies, relatives and friends of some politicians were rewarded, leaving out party loyalists.Close allies of the DP &mdash; including Energy CS Charles Keter, Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen and former Energy CS Davis Chirchir &mdash; are accused of nominating their friends.Aspirants&rsquo; spokesman Phillip Chebunet on Monday said they were angry with the lists for both MCAs and MPs who have been gazetted for nomination.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s unfair that people who are not known in the party are in the lists, while those who have worked for Jubilee have been left out. We will go to court to demand withdrawal of the names for Uasin Gishu,&rdquo; he said.Uhuru will be in Eldoret for a one-day visit to commission an economic zone at Plateau before he returns in a week for round two of his campaigns in the region.We&rsquo;ll withdraw our supportJubilee loyalists in Nandi and Elgeyo Marakwet also cried foul out over the list. Chebunet said they were unhappy that people living with disability had been ignored.They are also angry that the North Rift region was not given nomination slots for MP and senator, but the South Rift benefitted extensively.&ldquo;We urge the President and DP Ruto to look into this matter because it will affect the party at the grassroots level,&rdquo; Chebunet said.He was with other representatives of the aspirants, including Daniel Kemei, Nancy Chepsiya and Abraham Mutwol.The aspirants in Uasin Gishu insist they will withdraw support for Jubilee candidates because of the disputed nomination listThey say the 31 people proposed for the nominations also include girlfriends and relatives of party officials and powerful politicians, and even a Kanu member.&ldquo;We cannot accept the list that is full of mipango ya kando and friends of some people, yet those of us who worked for the party and even paid nomination fees for the primaries have been left out,&rdquo; Chebunet said.But party officials, led by county chairman Sammy Ruto, denied the claim and confirmed that the list had already been forwarded to the IEBC.&ldquo;The nomination issue was given to party candidates to handle and we are through with that,&rdquo; he said.
