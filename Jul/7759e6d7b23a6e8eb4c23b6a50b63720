Development Finance Institutions are central to the eradication of extreme poverty by 2030 as envisioned in the Sustainable Development Goals. Closer home, DFIs are an effective tool for realizing Vision 2030; when deployed strategically. These are government-backed institutions that invest in private sector projects in priority areas that have high potential for jobs, economic growth and tax collection.To do this effectively, there is a growing need to mobilize resources not just in million, but in billions and trillions. At the same time, traditional official sources are limited, and unlikely to increase dramatically in the coming years. Also, with increases in population, government resources are stretched over competing social needs such as education, health and security. The implication is that a mix of aid, domestic government resources and private sector capital is needed to achieve results. The key strength of DFIs is the ability to catalyze investment in the private sector beyond their own resources, and therefore fill in the resource gap. This is important, because it is now well understand that economic growth will come from the private sector. Studies have shown that 9 out of 10 jobs created in the developing world are in the private sector. The sector therefore needs to be properly supported in a friendly investment and business climate. When well deployed, DFI are a powerful and precise development tool to deliver long term sustainable development impact. Access to finance, especially long-term finance, remains a major constraint to the benefits that the private sector can deliver. There is therefore need for policymakers to support DFIs and to deploy them to help drive private sector investment. This is particularly for priority areas such as agribusiness, leather and textiles. DFIs need to engage more fully in helping to design, or even take the lead in designing private sector development. To be more effective, DFIs need to evolve and expand their capabilities to respond to emerging policy goals. On the other hand, policymakers need to understand how and where DFIs need to be deployed. Four areas are key to successful deployment of DFIs. One, a higher risk tolerance. The risk tolerance of DFIs goes beyond the conventional banking practice. Two, greater willingness to accept, in most cases, lower returns with a greater focus on development impact than profit. Three, the need to deploy more resources in form of finances and staff, in order to play a larger role and take on new tasks. Four, improvement in ability to disseminate lessons learnt and to measure impact.As the policy landscape is changing to put more emphasis on private sector investment, jobs and growth, DFIs have a unique and strategic role to play. Policymakers need to support DFIs and to deploy them to help solve more and emerging economic challenges. Karen is the Managing Director of IDB Capital (formerly Industrial Development Bank)
