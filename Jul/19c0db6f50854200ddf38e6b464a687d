A section of teachers from Kiambu East have denied that they have political affiliations to the National Super Alliance (NASA).This followed after Kenya National Union of Teachers Secretary General Wilson Sossion attended the NASA manifesto launch.The union official was among hundreds of Kenyans who attended the ceremony presided over by opposition chief Raila Odinga.Raila is vying against President Uhuru Kenyatta (Jubilee Party) in a race that has attracted six other candidates.But Kiambu East Knut secretary general Clement Gicharu on Monday said they disagree with Sossion's move.He added that not all teachers are backing the opposition further accusing their secretary general of failing them."Teachers will not help Sossion to deliver his own political ambitions. He should not drag us along. We have our own rights.""There has been no consultation regarding what the SG is purporting. We can't follow him as we also have our own interests," Gicharu said.The Knut official urged the government not to victimise teachers owing to the sentiments of their union boss.Samuel Muiruri, Kiambu East Knut chairman, the SG's move should not misconstrued to mean teachers are in NASA."We have the best collective bargaining agreement with the government of the day and we can not abuse it," he said.In February, Sossion said that Knut members enjoy the right to a political decision but not under the umbrella of the union."The union does not support any political party. We engage with the government of the day."He added that the union permits staff and elected members to take leave so as to vie for any political seat.More on this: Knut will not back any party during August 8 vote, says Sossion
