A Nation journalist was on Thursday at the receiving end of KOT&rsquo;s rage after writing an article warning against possible violence in Kibera ahead of the August 8 polls.In the article titled 'Fear in slums as the youth prepare for poll violence', Stella Cherono said &ldquo;Tension is building up in Kenya&rsquo;s biggest slum as youth openly organize themselves for chaos or to defend their communities ahead of the August 8 Elections. "The youth are positioning themselves in different zones and have selected their leaders."But Kenyans on Twitter who read the story published on Wednesday were not impressed with its contents and expressed this using the hashtag #SomeoneTellStellaCherono.Among them was Kibera MP Ken Okoth posted a screenshot of the story saying "This article is a disgrace and very reckless. "The person quoted as #JoashOkello chairman of Kamkunji did not speak with the reporter #StellaCherono. Where did she get the quotes from? #FakeNews."@Oman_KE retorted, "She should be ashamed for writing such an article while we're busy promoting peace #TribelessYouth."@Boncrazy1 said &ldquo;Stop propagating fear into Kenyans that there will be violence. Kenya is peaceful and nobody is preparing for violence.&rdquo;@Sirgab_jnr added &ldquo;If this is not hate speech what is it?? NCIC sleeping on the job. What do u fight if not such people like Stella."&ldquo;Kenyans are not fools to fight please people once beaten twice shy,&rdquo; @SilasMutiti tweeted.But @CyrusKips concurred with Stella&rsquo;s sentiments saying, &rdquo;What Stella Cherono wrote about is very true.&rdquo;@sokhi14 also agreed with Stella: &ldquo;Don't kill her 4 sayin da truth...there is, if someone is to blame it&rsquo;s those #unrulyyouths n security.&rdquo;Yet, @YatichZeph said; &ldquo;This article passed editorial eyes. The messenger should not be killed&rdquo;.The hashtag was still attracting comments as late as 6pm Thursday.The backlash against Stella came even after Nairobi police boss Japheth Koome on Tuesday gave a list of areas mapped as hot spots for possible violence ahead of the August 8 polls. Major informal settlements including Kibera made it on the list as the areas which will be placed under heavy police scrutiny before, during and after the elections. Others are Korogocho, Mathare, Mukuru, Kangemi, Ngara, Marurui, Landhies Road and Umoja.Dagorretti, Kawangware, Buruburu, Globe Cinema, Kariobangi, Dandora, Kayole, Kiambiu and Githogoro are also listed.
