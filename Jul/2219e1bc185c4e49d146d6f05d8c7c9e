Nairobi assembly speaker Alex Magelo has recalled MCAs for 10 days, starting today, to investigate reports that City Hall wants to sell the Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company to a French firm.Workers at the company have boycotted work for the last two weeks, claiming the county has hatched a plan to privatise the state corporation.The Kenya County Government Workers Union branch secretary Matilda Kimetto claimed they have &ldquo;intercepted&rdquo; an unsigned draft MoU between the company&rsquo;s board of management and SUEZ Company from France, stipulating the terms of sale.Kimetto also claimed the board has been &ldquo;playing politics&rdquo; with the running of the corporation with the sole aim of destabilising its operations to justify the privatisation.Suez listed in franceAccording to the document seen by the Star, SUEZ is a duly registered company in France with share capital of $3.2 billion.The document reads, &ldquo;The purpose of this MoU is to establish the basis for an operation and performance contract between the NCWSC and SUEZ to improve the water service of Nairobi. In order to obtain quick and tangible results, it has been agreed between SUEZ and the NCWSC to set up a local private company to implement specific services and investments.&rdquo;County secretary Robert Ayisi and Water executive Peter Kimori denied the claims, terming them &ldquo;fake and politically instigated&rdquo;. &ldquo;The governor has assured them we don&rsquo;t have any plans to sell the company, but they [workers] are still protesting,&rdquo; he said on Friday.Workers read a sinister motiveTwo weeks ago, the board declined to renew contracts of two finance directors, but the company workers are reading a sinister motive in the move, saying it is part of the wider plan to destabilise the firm and use it as an excuse to sell it.&ldquo;We need to be told why this MoU was drafted, why it was abandoned and why the contracts of two performing directors, who have made us win global awards, have not been renewed?&rdquo; she posed.County Assembly Water Committee chairman Alex Otieno said his team will also investigate the workers&rsquo; claims the board is not properly constituted. It will also look into the company&rsquo;s financial books after it emerged the board members have spent millions of shilling travelling aboard.&ldquo;We understand that the board members, who have been in office for less than a year, have travelled abroad seven times in business class. These are serious claims that we are going to investigate,&rdquo; he said.On Friday, the workers picketed outside City Hall and blocked City Hall Way for hours, demanding they be addressed by Governor Evans Kidero. Kimetto said they will continue demonstrating until they get a written assurance from the governor that the board will be disbanded, the company will not be sold and the contract of the two directors are renewed.
