President Uhuru Kenyatta is expected to tour Samburu on Wednesday where he will drum up support for his reelection bid.The tour, the head of state's second to the pastoral county this year, is coming amid high expectations from the people.Residents want to get his word on the ongoing security operation to flush out bandits sprawling Laikipia and its environs.They also want the president to address the problem of ranch invasions and the issue of compensation of livestock lost in the operation.Most of those interviewed said they expect the president to call off the ongoing security operation, citing loss of livelihoods.The state, however, maintained that the operation will not be halted until it assesses that the region is safe.James Lesoipa, a resident, said the operation has left them poor having lost livestock which they depend on for survival."Most of the people affected in the security operation in Laikipia are our sons. We have lost livestock and our people have also been injured.""If the president issues a compensation notice, then he will earn the votes of the Samburus," he said.He added that they also expect the head of state to address the confusion over a six-piece Jubilee vote which is threatened by strong Kanu hopefuls.Lesoipa accused Kanu aspirants of hijacking Jubilee projects in the name of supporting the president's reelection."Kanu aspirants were coordinating Samburu leaders' visit to State House. As voters, we are confused over which party to work with," he said.Dickson Lakope, a resident of Kisima town, said he expects the president to address the issue of roads in the county.He said that all national government roads in the county are in deplorable conditions hence a challenge to trade and development.He cited the Maralal-Rumuruti highway as among those that they want the state to prioritise."Some investors cannot access Maralal when it rains. People sleep on the road. The president should tell us when and whether the road will be tarmacked," he said.Also read: Al Shabaab, Laikipia bandits key threats to election, says Matiang'iMore on this: Lamu, Garissa and Tana River curfews not ending soon, says UhuruIt is not clear where Uhuru will hold a public rally after Maralal Kenyatta stadium was declared out of bounds.The stadium named after the first Kenyan President Jomo Kenyatta was cursed by Samburu elders earlier this year.This was after women aligned to Jubilee held demonstrations on the grounds and burned Raila Odinga's effigy.The Women accused Raila of disrespecting their leaders during his visit to Maralal on February this year.After cursing the stadium, Samburu elders said that the demonstrators had embarrassed the county by disrespecting a national political leader."Samburu is a democratic county where any leader is welcome here without restrictions," John Lokipeny, a Samburu elder, said.Since then no public rally has been held in the grounds after the curse.In order to cleanse the grounds and deem it fit for use, the elders demanded a ram from every woman who took part in the demonstration.Consequently, when Raila toured Samburu last week he was forced to hold his rally five kilometres out of town.However, religious leaders prayed for the stadium but elders insisted that they must cleanse it first as per the Samburu customs.
