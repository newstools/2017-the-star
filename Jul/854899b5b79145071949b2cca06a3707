Former national champions Kakamega High School hope the experience and exposure picked by midfield duo of Ronald Sicheje and Joshua Otieno abroad will help them post good results as the Kenya Secondary Schools Sports Association (KSSSA) Term 2B Games gets underway next week in Nyeri.Sichenje was attached to La Masia Academy in Barcelona for the better part of last year while Otieno was part of the SportPesa All Stars Squad that recently toured England and subsequently lost 2-1 to Hull City development side.Otieno impressed Hull City technical bench and has since been training at the Bishop Burton College before he returned to the team last week.Coach Brenden Nwinamo said their presence adds one or two things to an already formidable squad that is ready to reclaim status and go all the way to the East Africa Games in Uganda next month.&ldquo;Definitely the two bring on board exposure and experience that they picked while training at their respective clubs but all in all we are ready for the games. We have missed the event for two years but let us just say we are here now bigger and better,&rdquo; said the tactician.He added: &ldquo;Of course our absence at the national goes along way to prove there is growth and the games are competitive. We are 11-time national champions and therefore we have a name to guard. We will be going full throttle to record good result as our goal is to represent the country at the East Africa Games in Uganda.&rdquo;Kakamega fondly referred to as &ldquo;Green Commandos&rdquo; have been drawn in pool &lsquo;A&rsquo; alongside Passenga, Kathungi, Garissa and Nwinamo as descriobed the pooling as interesting. &ldquo;Every team at the national is there on merit and so we will not underrate any team. Ours will be to take one game at time and hopefully, we will emerge top of the pool and see what happens from there.&rdquo;Pool &lsquo;B&rsquo; has St Anthony, Ramisi, Kanga and Upper-hill.
