He said all the institutions involved in ensuring the election is conducted smoothly have done their part in readiness for the exercise. “The election will be held on August 8 as required by the Constitution, and the government has taken steps to ensure Kenyans exercise their democratic right and choose their leaders without interference,” Uhuru said. He assured that the polls will be peaceful. “We have also taken measures to ensure that the polls are credible, free and fair as well as ensuring that the country will be safe during and after the polls,” Uhuru said.
