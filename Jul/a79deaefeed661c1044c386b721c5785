Sixteen Anglican Church of Kenya bishops have expressed confidence that the IEBC will deliver a credible election on August 8 and urged political leaders to carry out issue-based campaigns.Bishop Stephen Kewasis, who led the clerics from Western, Nyanza and Rift Valley, said political leaders should avoid insults and be ready to accept the election results. He urged the electoral commission to carry out voter education because of voter apathy and lack of trust.&ldquo;The IEBC has put in place several mechanisms to deliver credible elections. While these may be commendable, we ask all stakeholders to be vigilant so that we all deliver free fair and credible polls,&rdquo; they said in a statement read by Kewasis.The bishops, along with more than 200 pastors and other clerics, met at the St Mathew&rsquo;s ACK in Eldoret town, where they also held prayers for a peaceful election.They signed the &lsquo;Wajibika pledge&rsquo;, which calls for responsible leadership and accountability in the election.
