Siaya leaders have criticised the suspension of campaigns by IEBC officials. Bondo MP Gideon Ochanda and Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi have faulted the IEBC officers in Siaya for suspending campaigns &ldquo;on no tangible grounds&rdquo;.Ochanda said the officials should not have punished all candidates when chaos occurred in one constituency.Addressing the press in Bondo on Sunday, Ochanda said the blanket ban should be lifted immediately.&ldquo;Siaya IEBC officials should know that not all candidates perpetrated chaos in Rarieda. They should stop infringing on our rights with a blanket ban,&rdquo; he said.Ochanda said, &ldquo;Before IEBC officials reached their ruling, I believe they had preliminary information on the Rarieda chaos perpetrators, those are the people they should have punished, not us.&rdquo; Wandayi said the IEBC&rsquo;s action is high-handed and draconian. He said the move is unwarranted.
