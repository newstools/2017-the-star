A group of Muslim women in Kilifi county have launched a campaign to woo residents to vote for President Uhuru Kenyatta.The women, under the name &lsquo;Wamama na Maggie&rsquo;, yesterday said they want Uhuru to get a second term so First Lady Margaret Kenyatta can continue her Beyond Zero campaign.They want all Jubilee candidates in Kilifi, led by point man and governor hopeful Gideon Mung&rsquo;aro, to win all seats in the 35 wards. The county is seen as an ODM zone.Last Friday, the women met Jubilee Party officials from Nairobi, led by party coordinator Joseph Mathai, Ahadi Kenya Trust&rsquo;s Stanley Kamau and former Miss World Kenya Cecilia Mwangi, to discuss a campaign strategy.The women will move door-to-door wooing voters. They said ODM and NASA do not deserve votes. The group said incumbent Governor Amason Kingi has done little for residents.Some women said they were previously ODM diehards for years, but ditched the party for Jubilee because &ldquo;it has a vision for women through the First Lady.&rdquo; Zamzam Ali said women&rsquo;s groups in all the 35 wards will campaign for Jubilee.
