Many have speculated over what indefinable qualities make for the perfect derriere.But now scientists believe they have come up with a precise mathematical formula which will identify the world&rsquo;s best female bottoms.And it turns out that it all hinges on a magic number - the ratio between the waist and the hips.They found the most admired figure - expressed in scientific terms as a ratio of 0.7 - was the same as the vital statistics of stars such as Sophia Loren, Marilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor.In the modern era, a number of celebrities approach the magic number.British actress and model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, who has a 25inch waist and 35inch hips comes in at 0.71, calculated by dividing the waist measurement by the hip measurement.The American singer Beyonce Knowles-Carter boasts a ratio which comes very close to the &lsquo;ideal&rsquo; at 0.65 &ndash; with a 26inch waist and 40inch hips.To reach their conclusion, scientists surveyed 583 plastic surgeons and 450 members of the public in 40 countries, showing them photographs of a 27-year-old volunteer model.The image was digitally altered to create a range of different body profiles.And overall the researchers said 39 per cent found the 0.7 waist to hip ratio "to be their ideal".The authors write "of all body parts, across many cultures and time, the buttocks have endured as a key body element of female beauty."The authors, writing in the journal &lsquo;Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery&rsquo; conclude: "There seems to exist a global consensus regarding the ideal waist to hip ratio."Waist to hip ratio is not just a measure of beauty, but increasingly doctors say that it is a better measure of health than body mass index.Standards varied between countries with surgeons in Latin America preferring the largest buttocks, followed by surgeons in Asia, North America and Europe.Having a slim waist compared to your hips is a better indicator of health than overall weight and height as measured by BMI, several studies have found.Previous research has also found 0.7 to be the magic number.Dr Barnaby Dixson, a New Zealand anthropologist, carried out similar research in 2010 involving showing subjects digitally altered photographs.Dr Dixson, whose results were published in the Archives of Sexual Behaviour, said: "It is likely that perfect 0.7 ratio sends a biological signal to men that woman is most fertile and most likely to produce a healthy offspring, no matter what size that woman is."It is all about the distribution of fat which is directly linked to fertility."Elizabeth Cashdan of Utah University, in a separate research project, found that Playboy centrefold models also approached the &lsquo;optimum&rsquo; female figure &ndash; with a typical waist to hip ratio of 0.68.Buttock augmentation is becoming an increasingly popular operation. The authors write that the numbers of enhancements have increased by more than 20 per cent between 2014 and 2015.Augmentation can be carried out with fat transfer and implants.Implantation has on occasion led to tragic results &ndash; with one British woman, Joy Williams, 23, from Thamesmead, dying after &pound;2,000 buttock augmentation surgery went wrong.
