Kiambu speaker Gathii Irungu has said action will be taken against MCAs who decamped to ODM on Monday.He said they risk losing their seats. "The assembly is made uup of 88 members and only eight defected to ODM, although they are yet to make it official. According to the [law] if one defects to another party definitely one loses their seat," Gathii said.He spoke at the county assembly on Monday. Opposition leader Raila Odinga on Monday received 13 defectors, mostly sitting MCAs and aspirants, from Kiambu county.Gathii said despite the defections, Kiambu is still a Jubilee zone. He said most members are still in Jubilee while those who are running for office as independents still support the President.Out of the 88 MCAs only four got the Jubilee ticket. They include Cecilia Wamaitha (Gatuanyaga), Philip Mubea (Cianda), Jackie Nungari (Bibirioni) and Ndiba Thandi (Uthiru). Eighteen are defending their seats as independents.The MCAs who jumped ship said they were disgruntled by the Jubilee Party after it sidelined, despite being ardent followers of the party.Thika Hospital Ward MCA Mwangi wa Mwangi, in a phone interview, said the defection was a personal development."Since I lost in Jubilee party nominations I opted to weigh my options in my political career. Also it is my democratic right to be in any party," he said.Sigona MCA Mutonya Njenga, on his Facebook page, assured ODM leader of a peaceful Kiambu tour "devoid of drama and political theatrics".He wrote, however, that he is still an ardent Jubilee member and a firm believer in President Uhuru Kenyatta's leadership.
