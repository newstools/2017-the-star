Majority of Kenyans prefer traditional media as their first source of information, the latest media consumer survey has revealed According to the study released by the Kenya Audience Research Foundation (KARF), the average number of Kenyans who consume media daily is 16 million; 94 per cent of which consume TV, radio and print while only 33 per cent consume new media but not exclusively. This survey marries a 2016 media landscape in Kenya conducted by FMC group which revealed that a whopping 97 per cent of Kenyans prefer traditional media platforms. It indicated that 64.8 per cent of Kenyans value Radio, 30.6 per cent TV and 1.6 per cent prefer newspapers. Only 1.9 per cent go on line, 0.8 per cent on social media while the rest read magazines. Even so, five million Kenyans are still media dark. In terms of age demographics, the survey show that from 24.7 million Kenyans aged 15 years and above only 19 million of them consume media on an average week. The data show that 4.8 per cent are aged 15- 17years, 18.2 per cent 18 -24 years, 30.5 per cent 25 - 34 years, 19.2 per cent 35 - 44 years while 27. 3 per cent are 45 years and above Kenyans between the ages of 18 to 24 increased their viewership by two per cent, 25 to 34 years old had an eight per cent increase, age 35 to 44 and 45+ viewership increased by 14 per cent and 10 per cent respectively which goes to show that most adults appreciate the political impact on prime-time news. The only decline was for Kenyans between the age of 15 to 17 years old who watched more TV in March than in April bringing about a 6 per cent decrease of viewership. ‘’While trends show that upmarket Kenyans are getting their news from social media platforms, majority are still consuming traditional media. This can be attributed to the accessibility and perceived authenticity of the news on traditional media; New media is here to stay but traditional media is still king,’’ said Lenny Ng’ang’a, chairman KARF Technical Oversight Committee. Furthermore, the survey indicated that men are consuming much media content than their female counterparts. According to the survey, out of the total audience of 19 million, 51 per cent are men while women are at 49 per cent. There was a marked increase in viewership in the month of April proving that politics on prime-time news still has an impact. The survey also highlighted the impact of fragmentation following the digital migration; Kenyans are currently accessing over 337 TV channels. 66 (66 of which are local channels), 243 radio stations, 44 newspapers and 42 magazine titles and 37 on line sites.
