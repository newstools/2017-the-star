Religious leaders have urged residents of Lari to pray for peace so Kenya can avoid election chaos. Full Gospel Church Bishop David Njoroge expressed concern that political competition has heightened and so has mudslinging that can only be controlled through prayers and tolerance. “The time has come for everyone to pray for peace and to practise it. We must accept to remain calm since we need this county today, tomorrow and the days after,” he said on Wednesday. “Supporters of each candidate in all elective seats are eager to see their candidate win. They are also campaigning every minute.” Njoroge was accompanied by a number of clerics at the Nyambare trading centre during a prayer rally organised by church leaders, business people and residents. Businessman Paul Ngugi said residents have been victims of post-election violence because they host internally displaced people each time chaos erupts. “We hosted victims of post-polls chaos in 1992, 1997 and 2007. We would not want to see that happening again. We don’t want to host others.”
