The body of bodyguard Ayub Ndoloni, who was with Public Works
PS Mariam El Maawy when a group of over 30 armed suspected
al Shabaab militants hijacked their vehicle at Milihoi, Lamu West, on Thursday
has been found. The AP officer's badly burnt body was found in the forest near the scene of
the attack on Saturday at 10am by officers conducting a security operation. Lamu county commissioner Joseph Kanyiri said the body was taken to the Mpeketoni Subcounty Hospital mortuary. “It is true. Security officers on an operation have discovered the body of PS
Mariam El Maawy’s bodyguard today at around 10am in the forest near the
incident at Milihoi ... He died
defending his boss. He went down defending the dignity of this country. I knew
him for more than three years. He was a diligent soldier,” he said. Three security officers died during the attack on Thursday. Among those who died is El Maawy’s nephew, pilot trainee Arif Kassim
Athman. Arif, 21, is said to have been trapped in the vehicle that later blew up and was
burnt beyond recognition. He was buried at Mokowe Cemetery in Lamu West on Friday evening. The bodyguard was reported missing shortly after the Milihoi attack on Thursday
with police suspecting that he had been taken hostage by the terrorists. The discovery of hiss body brings the death toll of those who perished to five. The PS is being treated in Nairobi.
