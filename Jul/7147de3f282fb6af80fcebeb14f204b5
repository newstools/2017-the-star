Scores of supporters of Nyeri governor independent candidate Thuo Mathenge took to the streets in Nyeri and Karatina town. They were protesting against the move by the IEBC to strike out his name from the register. They waved placards, twigs and blowed whistles. The supporters stormed the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission offices in Nyeri town on Friday. They demanded to be addressed by Nyeri county IEBC manager Alicia Kanini. However, armed police blocked them from accessing the area, despite them camping at the gate. They ignored Kanini’s efforts to convince them that the matter is in court and continued protesting. They took to the streets demanding an explanation on why Mathenge was locked out of the governor race. Mathenge’s name was not in the official gazzetment notice of the IEBC, an issue which prompted the candidate to have his lawyer Kioko Kilukumi write to the polls agency. The aspirant has been in and out of court after the IEBC awarded him the nomination certificate. It was later cancelled over his academic papers. His degree in Social Work and Social Development from Fairland University, Uganda, was allegedly fake. He has said the matter is in court and that his degree is genuine. “How come Mike Sonko, Hassan Joho, Ferdinand Waititu and Anne Waiguru were cleared? Why block our candidate?” said Peter Gitahi, one of the supporters. A second supporter, John Githaga, demanded the immediate placement of Mathenge’s name in the IEBC register. Githaga said Mathenge has the right to vie for the seat. Similar protests were held in Karatina town.
