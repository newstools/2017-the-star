Almost three million Mercedes Benz diesel cars and vans across Europe have been recalled amid concerns over toxic emissions. In a drastic move which casts fresh doubt over the future of diesel engines, German car giant Daimler urged drivers to take their cars into the local garage to have a ‘software update’ installed. This will cut emissions of toxic nitrogen oxides, which are linked to respiratory disease. The ‘voluntary recall’ covers nearly all diesel Mercedes Benz cars registered in Europe, including the UK, over the last few years. Daimler, which owns Mercedes Benz, would not give a breakdown of how many vehicles in each country. But last night experts at motoring magazine What Car? suggested it could affect up to 300,000 motorists in Britain, which is one of Mercedes’ biggest markets. One Labour MP last night said the recall would increase concerns among diesel drivers everywhere. It comes amid continued scrutiny of the company’s emissions systems by the German government and calls for bans on diesel engines in city centres. Last week, suspicion of diesel emissions cheating on two Mercedes Benz engines resulted in Daimler executives being summoned to meet government officials in Berlin. A previous voluntary recall in March addressed concerns on 274,000 Mercedes Benz compact cars and V-Class vans. But Daimler claimed it was all about reassuring drivers.
