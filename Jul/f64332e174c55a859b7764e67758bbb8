Muslim Clerics in TanaRiver County wants the government to withdraw the curfew imposed by newly appointed Interior CS Fred Matiang'i, terming it unjustified. The Muslim leaders wondered why Matiang'i included Tana River in the dusk to dawn curfew yet the county has never experienced any attacks for over four years. On Friday immediately after his appointment, the CS inflicted the curfew in Lamu, TanaRiver and Garissa Counties following the increased cases of al-Shabaab militants attacks. Council of Imams and Preachers of Kenya (CIPK) chairman in Tana River Sheikh Musa said the county is united and peaceful. “We urge the government to remove the curfew, we cannot carry the burden of other counties,” he said. Musa together with other religious were addressing a press conference at Cartas hotel in Garsen town on Sunday. He said in the previous years, the county used to experience deadly clashes during the electioneering period. However, he said currently there has been no sign of insecurity. He urged all Muslim communities in Tana River County to reelect President Uhuru and Governor Hussein Dado so as to continue the peaceful coexistence. Also present at the press conference were Sheikh Salim Omar Dima and Muslim scholar Sheikh Idris Bakero. “We want President Kenyatta to lift the curfew, the county is peaceful and people are happy,’’ said Bakero. He said most of the terror attacks have been experienced in Garissa and Lamu counties. Bakero said Tana River County was now a Jubilee Zone and all Muslims shall vote for the party because of their effort to ensure peace prevails amongst the communities. “Muslims should blend regardless of colour and tribe to reelect Dado and President Uhuru Kenyatta,’’ he said.
