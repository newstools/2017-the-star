Senator Mike Sonko yesterday defended his record and presented documents he said implicate Governor Evans Kidero &ldquo;and his cronies in corrupt dealings&rdquo;.Sonko, the JP governor candidate, told a press conference at Nairobi Safari Hotel that he has fought injustices suffered by residents at the hands of the Kidero administration.Kidero dismissed the allegations.Sonko said he has dismantled &ldquo;corrupt City Hall cartels grabbing property and defrauding the city&rdquo;.&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve repossessed property worth more than Sh27 billion grabbed by corrupt county cartels that have flourished on Kidero&rsquo;s watch,&rdquo; he said.The legislator cited land belonging to the PCEA Church in Karen, Karen market, Ngara market, Kamkunji Secondary School and Lang&rsquo;ata High School and several private properties he has &ldquo;salvaged from the cartels&rdquo;.Sonko presented documents he said &ldquo;implicate Kidero and his cronies in corrupt dealings&rdquo;. He produced copies of letters he said he had written to EACC, the DCI and the DPP, seeking intervention.&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done all I can, I don&rsquo;t know what is wrong with these institutions. There is no action they have taken, despite evidence I provided,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Corruption has been the undoing of the Kidero administration. The mistakes he has committed are unforgivable and Nairobians must punish him at the ballot,&rdquo; he said.But Kidero said, &ldquo;Sonko knows the authorities that deal with corruption. He can go to the EACC, the DCI and even our assembly. As the senator, he has a permanent seat in the assembly, but he has never raised these issues.&rdquo;&ldquo;PAC and PIC committees are mandated to check our excesses. Both are chaired by Jubilee MCAs and they have never raised these issues. What Sonko is doing is what we call kicks of a dying horse. He knows he is facing a losing battle. It&rsquo;s a case of the pot calling the kettle black.&rdquo;On Kidero&rsquo;s claim he has not fought to recover Sh72 billion owed to the county by the state, Sonko said, &ldquo;I did nothing about it because Kidero has not accounted for the billions [of shillings] he receives every year.&rdquo;His running mate Polycarp Igathe said the administration has failed in all respects. &ldquo;The county financial affairs are in shambles and none of its priorities has been addressed. Its accounts reveal a litany of illegalities,&rdquo; he said.Igathe presented a report &mdash; &lsquo;The Problems of Nairobi County: Chronicle of a City Mismanaged&rsquo; &mdash; on how the city allegedly has been run down. It says the administration runs multiple concealed bank accounts.
