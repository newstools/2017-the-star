NASA will stop major ongoing national projects if it wins the election, a group of MPs from Central have said. The group campaigning for President Uhuru Kenyatta’s reelection under the name UhuRuto Express traversed Embu county on Thursday. Led by Gichugu MP Njogu Mbarua, the group said development will stall if NASA takes power. He said NASA would stop the tarmacking of the road that connects four constituencies. The MPs were hosted by Mbeere legislator Muriuki Njagagua. Maragua MP Peter Kamande said NASA wants to stop all Jubilee projects including the SGR, stipends for the elderly, and laptop distribution. He said NASA is jealous of Jubilee’s track record. Kamande said residents’ standard of living will decline.
