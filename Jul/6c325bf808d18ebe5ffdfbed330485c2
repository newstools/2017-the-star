President Uhuru Kenyatta has entered a truce with the Maasai in Narok to correct his great grandfather’s wrongs in the late 1890s. Uhuru’s great grandfather Kung’u Magana married a Maasai captive without paying her bride price. The talks with the Kajiado and Narok Maasai began early this year. Uhuru appointed former Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery, former assistant ministers David Sankori and Ngengi Muigai, and Captain (Rtd) Kung’u Muigai to represent him in the negotiations. In an exclusive interview with the Star in Kajiado, Captain Muigai explained that Kikuyu warriors in the late 1890s raided a manyatta in Narok and took away a herd of cows and a young girl. The girl, called Musana, was taken to Gatundu in the homestead of Magana, the father of Kung’u Magana. Kung’u later married Musana and changed her name to Wanjiru. The two gave birth to Muigai, who was the father of the country’s first President, Mzee Jomo Kenyatta, and Kung’u Muigai. Captain Muigai and Ngengi are President Uhuru’s first cousins. Captain Muigai said since Uhuru was named after his great grandfather, the onus is on him to pay the bride price.
