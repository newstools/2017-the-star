NASA leaders have claimed that Interior PS Karanja Kibicho met some journalists based in Central Kenya and asked them not to cover everything they will see on Election Day, especially ballot stuffing. But in a quick response, Kibicho said: "Whatever the NASA guys are smoking must be very strong. They are all over with wild allegations. The straight answer is NO. tell them to dare me and we shall be in court with them for a long time. I do not have time for their absurd and nonsensical utterances".**********THAT NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga and Tanzanian President John Magufuli are close buddies is no secret. Following recent activities, including the directive by President Magufuli that schoolgirls who become pregnant should not be re-admitted to school and the arrest of an MP who is said to have insulted the President, the Jubilee brigade seems to have made political capital and have turned the heat on Raila, saying Magufuli could be his mentor since he has not come out to condemn developments that civil society considers undemocratic.**********A contractor that was awarded several contracts to construct roads in Nairobi's Eastlands area and two others in Starehe constituency has found it difficult to complete the works on time as some of the contracts terms require them to complete at the same time. It is understood that the constructions company has been overwhelmed with the roadworks and has now resorted to building on a rotational basis, where they stay on one site for a month before moving to the next. Residents in the said areas believe that if Roads and Infrastructure CS James Macharia and PS John Mosonik will not inspect the works, there are high chances of shoddy work being done. **********ALL is not well at a parastatal that falls under the ministry of Health. That is after a top official of the parastatal asked the evaluation team to change the technical scores of a particular tender so that a preferred firm wins. The decision has rattled other officials in the know, who see the action as criminal. They have now vowed to forward the evidence to the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission for investigations.***********WHAT may have informed the organizers of the IAAF World Under-18 Championships to use a monkey in an advert that appeared in a local daily yesterday? The monkey appeared to be a female cheering on a pole vault lady athlete. While the organisers may have had good intentions, the use of the monkey evoked feelings about the Dark Continent hosting the international event that is expected to bring together 1,140 athletes from 123 countries.
