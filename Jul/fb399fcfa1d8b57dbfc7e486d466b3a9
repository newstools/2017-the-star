The NASA national presidential campaign coordinator for Western Khalid Njiraini has said Jubilee is planning to disenfranchise youth in opposition strongholds by making them drunk so they don't vote on August 8. In a statement he released yesterday, Njiraini said Jubilee is also buying IDs from Western residents.&ldquo;We request all drinking joints to remain closed on the voting day, because we know there is a plot by Jubilee to make our youth drunk so they do not vote. We are aware of all the tricks Jubilee intends to use in our strongholds, including buying of IDs to ensure low voter turnout,&rdquo; he said.Njiraini said NASA had intensified its vote hunt in the region through door-to-door campaign strategy.The Western region has three million registered voters that NASA and Jubilee are keen to control. Some 1.9 million of the voters are in Western, while 1.1 million are scattered across the country.Analysts say Western could determine the outcome of the presidential race.Njiraini said the decision by President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto to blatantly violate the law by deploying civil servants to campaign for it confirms that Jubilee has panicked and is not committed to a free, fair and credible election.&ldquo;As NASA, we demand that the voter register be made available to the public until the Election Day. We want the report on the voters register audit by KMPG made public and names of dead voters published in the local dailies,&rdquo; he said.Njiraini said DPP Keriako Tobiko and Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet to resign for failing to arrest and prosecute public officers servants for engaging directly in politics.He said Jubilee is wasting time visiting Western as residents have already made up their minds to back NASA. The DP is expected to give out more than 1, 000 title deeds to residents of the Ndalu Settlement Scheme in Tongareni constituency in Bungoma county.
