Devolution Cabinet Secretary Mwangi Kiunjuri has been dragged into the political rivalry pitting Laikipia Governor aspirants. Incumbent Joshua Irungu and former assistant minister Ndiritu Muriithi are facing off in the race to be decided on August 8. The governor accused the latter of ruining President Uhuru Kenyatta's chances of getting a second term through a solid vote from the region. But Muriithi, in his response, said his competitor should be the one to be questioned for allowing an ODM MP to campaign for NASA in Jubilee platforms. He said Irungu’s political dalliance with Laikipia North ODM MP Matthew Lempurkel is the greatest threat to Jubilee Party's support. "Lempurkel is part of the governor's campaign team. They share the
same platform even as the MP mobilises votes for NASA flag bearer Raila
Odinga." Muriithi told the governor to be aware that his perceived waning support in the county is a result of Kiunjuri's comments over his leadership. "The CS, who is his trusted campaigner, recently admitted that Irungu exhibits weak and failed leadership." "The governor’s claim
is an act of pure desperation. His bad publicity is emanating from his
campaigners," he said on Sunday. But the county chief said his competitor is confusing voters by making threats and 'unreasonable demands'. The exchanges over the Uhuru reelection sabotage claims have raised political temperatures in the county. Muriithi -an independent - insists that he was the bonafide choice of people during the Jubilee primaries. "I would be the last person to sabotage President Kenyatta's re-election," he said.
