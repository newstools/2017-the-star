The EACC on Tuesday raided the Kisumu county offices and confiscated documents and computers over corruption allegations.Its officers took files, a data server and CPU from the procurement department and office of Planning chief officer George Akong&rsquo;o. They reportedly held a meeting with acting county secretary Ojwang&rsquo; Lusi at his office. Lusi, however, denied meeting the investigators, saying he did not see them.The investigators declined to disclose details of the allegations. But Western Kenya EACC boss Ben Kipkosgei denied knowledge of any ongoing probe at the offices, referring the media to the Nairobi offices.The carckdown comes at a time when hundreds of contractors have pitched tent at the county offices to demand their money. A senior county officer, who sought anonymity, said offices under probe include procurement and planning.At some point, they quizzed Akong&rsquo;o, who had informed the media of their presence at the offices. Efforts to get more information from Akong&rsquo;o were unsuccessful. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m still with the visitors and I can&rsquo;t talk to you now,&rdquo; he said.
