NHIF has moved to stop possible loss of millions of shillings through illegal sharing of insurance cards.Head of security Wilson Kamau said they have arrested two suspects, who have been charged in a Kajiado court.Sharing of NHIF cards is illegal and only registered individuals should benefit from the principal member&rsquo;s account.Kamau said impersonating the dependents or principal members to pay hospital bills is fraudulent, and attracts a minimum of Sh500,000 fine or a minimum of three years in prison.&ldquo;Such cases have been on the rise, especially among casual workers. But Kenyans must know illegal sharing of NHIF cards is punishable under the law,&rdquo; he said.Kamau said fraud can drain millions of shillings from the fund, denying genuine benefits to registered members.Head of Kajiado branch Jennifer Muriuki advised health facilities to carefully counter-check details when accepting NHIF cards. &ldquo;We now have an integrated system, so when you swipe the NHIF card you can clearly see the details of the principal members and their dependants,&rdquo; she said.In the Kajiado case, a 17-year-old girl used the card of her elder sister, Sandra Naliaka, even though she is not listed as her dependant.&ldquo;If you want to help your younger sibling, you can either enlist them as dependants if you&rsquo;re the principal contributor, or pay for them the lowest premium of Sh500,&rdquo; Muriuki said.Members now contribute a total of Sh2.2 billion every month.Chief executive Geoffrey Mwangi says they currently have about 6.5 principal members.&ldquo;If you take a ratio of about four dependants per member, we are talking about 24 million beneficiaries,&rdquo; he said.The highest monthly contribution is now Sh1,700 for those earning Sh100,000 and above. Those earning between Sh12,000 and Sh14,999 contribute the lowest monthly premium of Sh500.The fund says it now pays for chemotherapy, dialysis, and a raft of other operations, and pays for inpatients up to Sh4,000 a day.
