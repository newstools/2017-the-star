Kenya&rsquo;s dairy sector has realised remarkable growth in the past few years.Kenya Dairy Board MD Margaret Kibogy (pictured) yesterday said many counties have adopted milk programmes in schools, signifying a milestone. She spoke during a meeting in Nairobi.&ldquo;There are currently 25 milk processors in the country,&rdquo; she said, adding that the number grew from only one processor in the past few years.Livestock PS Andrew Tuimur urged the need for consultations in formulating 2017 regulations. &ldquo;The draft regulations are benchmarked on successful dairy countries in the world such as the US. They have also borrowed from the provisions of the existing Kenyan laws such as the Public Health Act Cap 242 and the Food, Drugs and Chemical Substances Act Cap 254,&rdquo; he said.Chairman Anthony Mutugi said the draft regulations are meant to improve sector surveillance.
