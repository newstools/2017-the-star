All schools in Basuba ward in Lamu East have been closed indefinitely. Twelve teachers posted by the government early this year fled citing insecurity and threats by al Shabaab. The schools are Basuba, Mangai, Milimani, Mararani and Kiangwe primary schools. The schools were re-opened in January after having been closed for more than two years following frequent Shabaab raids between 2014 and 2015. Speaking in Lamu town yesterday, Lamu East education officer David Kambi said the schools are not in operation. He said they opted to have pupils stay away until security is stabilised and teachers feel safe. “We expect to re-open the schools anytime we are told security has been stabilised,” Kambi said. The more than 400 pupils have not been in class for more than a month after teachers started fleeing. Mangai head teacher Mohamed Loo, who is also the Basuba Teachers Association spokesperson, said  teachers started leaving in May and none has returned. Loo said the teachers who fled have already requested the Teachers Service Comission for transfers. He said security in Basuba is still fragile and many fear for their lives. “We haven’t been to our respective schools since May and we won’t go back there even if they said security is stable. We have been threatened several times by al Shabaab since we work for the government,” he said. “We have decided we are better off without jobs.” Some of the teachers are temporarily teaching at Kizingitini and Manda primary schools in Lamu East. Lamu TSC director Charles Nyauma said he has received transfer requests and some tutors have already been issued with temporary transfers.
