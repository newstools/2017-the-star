Actor Ian Munene, popularly known as Almasi from the Machachari show, has been grabbing headlines of late. Ever since he called it a day at the famous kids’ TV programme, Almasi went abroad for further studies but he has been trending for controversial reasons. It all started with photos of Almasi smoking weed then followed by him posing with flowers on his head, leaving his fans questioning his sexuality. But if you thought that was all, Almasi recently shared more photos dressed eccentric and posing like female models, sending tongues wagging. Well, one courageous fan took to social media to ask Almasi if he was homosexual. “@ian_nene I love gays. I’ve never had anything against gays. I even know a gay guy when I see one and trust me I noticed you one during the machachari days. Just hoping you’re not in the ‘closet’ or in  denial. Always be yourself and never let anyone look down on you or judge you for anything. NEVER!, We’re all human everyone has their wrongs so no one should ever tell you nothing,” posted Essie. Many thought that the talented actor would not answer but he replied to his fan claiming that he isn’t one. Here is Almasi’s response; “Essie, then you’re just wrong girl. You noticed wrong girl. My apologies. Truth is you don’t know a gay guy when you see one. And I am not gay LOL. You are the people we need to change. THIS MINDSET OF THINKING YOU KNOW SOMEONE JUST BY LOOKING AT THEM IS MESSED UP.”
