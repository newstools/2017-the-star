Nyali MP Hezron Awiti has signed a political deal with more than 2,000 Imams and Madrassa teachers in Mombasa. The deal will see Muslim clerics support the MP’s bid for governor in exchange for a social services docket in the county government, should he win. In the deal signed on Saturday, Awiti pledged to set aside land for the Muslim community to initiate projects. This is the first kind of agreement with the Muslims. The agreement was made a month ago but the Imams, through the Madrasa Teachers Network, said they would have to wait for Ramadhan to end before they can sign the deal. Awiti’s running mate Hassan Mwamtoa was instrumental in brokering the deal. In the MoU, Awiti is compelled to strengthen, facilitate and back the teachers and Imams through tokens, to undertake their daily work.
