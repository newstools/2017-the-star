Kisumu ODM woman representative candidate Rosa Buyu on Friday condemned what she called an alleged plot to assassinate her rival Grace Akumu. She said the claims should not be taken lightly and urged police to swiftly investigate and charge suspects. However, Buyu also urged police to investigate if the allegations could be “mere lies” used by Akumu to seek popularity and gain sympathy. Akumu is the widow of Dennis Akumu, a former trade unionist and Nyakach MP. Akumu has alleged her opponents are plotting to kill her before the August 8 polls. She did not name them. Akumu, Buyu and Hildah Adhiambo (Independent) are in the woman MP race. Incumbent Rose Nyamunga is not seeking reelection. The leader of Citizens’ Convention Party reported the alleged plot at Kisumu Central police station on Tuesday. Akumu said 16 people have been trailing her and she has information they have been contracted by her rivals. She linked the plot to her “growing popularity”. Buyu called the allegation “highly regrettable” because women have struggled to enter the political spotlight. “We can’t condone attacks, intimidation and harassment against women in politics. Police should do what it takes to unearth the truth,” she said. Buyu told the county security team, led by Maalim Mohamed, to protect women candidates “because they are prone to [be victims of] political violence”. “Police should live up to their promise and ensure our safety as per the resolution reached with candidates,” Buyu told the Star on the phone.
