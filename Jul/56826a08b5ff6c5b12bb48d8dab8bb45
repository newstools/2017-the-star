A drunk father battered his six-month-old daughter to death on Christmas Eve after losing his temper, a court heard. Lee Parker, 33, from Bristol, was left alone with baby Aya, while her mother Zofia Kucharczyk went out for a festive meal on December 24, 2016. The pair met online and conceived the baby on the first weekend they spent together, but although their romance ended they decided to live together to raise the child. On Christmas Eve the pair shared a glass of sparkling wine before Zofia went out to enjoy herself with her new man, leaving the teething baby with Parker. But after knocking back two bottles of red wine and a third of a bottle of vodka, Parker killed Aya by battering her against a bathroom door. The attack was so ferocious that it shattered plasterboard in the bathroom and dented the shape of Aya's head into the surface. At 6 pm the defendant had snapped a selfie of him holding the sleeping baby against his chest. But in a matter of hours, she was found dead, bleeding from the mouth and ears after suffering a devastating brain injury.
