The impact of music has over the years been felt during the pre-independent, post-colonial, multi-party periods and the post-election violence that erupted in Kenya following the disputed December 27, 2007 presidential election.The power of music in Kenya&rsquo;s politics and its impact on ethnic relations, especially during electoral campaigns, is not an exception as the country moves towards the August 8 General Election.Many local artistes have produced and published songs aligned to different political camps, some of which have started eliciting mixed reactions among Kenyans on the country&rsquo;s political path.Various vernacular songs have taken centre stage in the ongoing political campaigns and some of them seem to not only set the political agenda but the ethnic one too.The songs include &ldquo;Bindu Bichenjanga&rdquo; by Amos Barasa, &ldquo;Nasa&rdquo; by Onyi Jalamo, &ldquo;Tano Tena&rdquo; by Ben Githae, &ldquo;Nasa Hao&rdquo; by Chepchumba Tanui, &ldquo;Kenya Tibim&rdquo; by Doris Tanui, &ldquo;Daudi&rdquo; by Joyce wa Mama, &ldquo;Jubilee Tuko Pamoja&rdquo; by Nicky Augustine, &ldquo;Tuko Pamoja&rdquo; by Sophie Murimi and &ldquo;Pamoja&rdquo;, the Jubilee campaign anthem.A recently produced song featuring a group of Kikuyu artistes has gone viral in social media platforms and provoked mixed reactions over its theme and agenda.Coded languageIts lyrics are about the political tussles between President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s Jubilee and Raila Odinga&rsquo;s NASA at the height of the presidential campaigns.The singers narrate, &ldquo;Raila is inciting other communities against the Kikuyu community and that it is high time that Kikuyus come out in large numbers to vote for Uhuru and not to allow power to slip out of their hands&rdquo;.The vernacular song is perceived to have coded language that propagates hate towards certain political leaders.&ldquo;We are a blessed race. Listen to what Joshua bandia is saying that we be chased from all places where we have bought farms. Gema and Mt Kenya, we need to speak in one voice and say &lsquo;it Uhuru&rsquo;.&ldquo;There is a trap called NASA we should avoid. If we let power go from our hands, if &lsquo;these&rsquo; people rule us, we will regret it. They have said if they take power Gikuyu &lsquo;will see&rsquo;. If you don&rsquo;t come out on 8.8.17 you will be committing suicide.&rdquo;In an interview yesterday, the National Cohesion and Integration Commission vice chairperson Irene Wanyoike said the commission would engage artistes and sensitise them on the need to preach peace during the election period.She said the commission had changed the strategy of dealing with artistes who spread hate speech through music and instead resorted to engaging in dialogue with them.&ldquo;As an institution established to reconcile Kenyans following the 2007-08 violence, the prevailing situation is unfortunate, irresponsible and worrying. We should realise that elections come and go but our country remains,&rdquo; Wanyoike said.She urged the media not to air songs that could compromise peace in the country, especially the vernacular radio stations. Wanyoike also urged people not to share such songs on social media to curb tension.The commission urged Kenyans to tone down on political intolerance and embrace diverse political views.Song was not incitefulIn June 2014, musician John Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a, popularly known as John De&rsquo;Mathew, was found innocent in a hate speech and incitement-to-violence case against him. De&rsquo;Mathew had been accused of producing and publishing songs in Kikuyu with words intended to cause violence.A Nairobi court ruled that his song Mwaka wa Hiti (the Year of the Hyena) does not propagate ethnic hatred.In the song, De&rsquo;Mathew had been accused of using the words: &ldquo;When Abraham disobeyed God, he was ordered to be circumcised. You General of Migingo, the panga is being sharpened&rdquo;.However, Nairobi magistrate Elena Nderitu said the words in the song produced in 2010 &ldquo;do not directly refer to Raila or any other politician&rdquo;.The Mugithi singer was charged after the then NCIC chairman, Mzalendo Kibunjia, ordered an investigation into the songs &ldquo;Mwaka wa Hiti&rdquo; composed by De Mathew, &ldquo;Hague-bound&rdquo; by Muigai wa Njoroge, and &ldquo;Uhuru ni Witu&rdquo; by Kamande wa Kioi.The commission hired the services of a certified translator to interpret the three vernacular songs and determine whether, as claimed, the songs contained tribal, divisive and inflammatory messages.But the cases hit a snag and no witnesses were called to testify. Njoroge and Kioi wrote to the commission requesting for an out-of-court reconciliation, which was granted. De&rsquo;Mathew pressed on with the case until he was cleared by the court.
