The National Intelligence Service has identified Likoni and Kisauni subcounties in Mombasa as likely post-election violence hotspots. A report from the spy agency warns that illegal groups may be used to cause chaos after the polls. This comes as Mombasa governor hopeful Hezron Awiti (pictured) asked the church to take its role in peace campaigns. The Nyali MP said there have been indications of violence in parts of the country, including in Likoni. &ldquo;Kenya belongs to all the people,&rdquo; the MP said. In the report, the spy agency recommends heavy deployment of security agents. &ldquo;We have mapped out hotspots and advised the security agents to put security measures in place. We are concerned about Likoni that has shown early signs of possible violence,&rdquo; an NIS officer familiar with the report told the Star. On Monday, detectives arrested three suspects for allegedly circulating hate leaflets in Likoni. The suspects were identified as Mohamood Majid, 39, Mohammed Bakari Dzengo, 29, and Mwalimu Shabaan, 41. &ldquo;They were held for allegedly being members of Hizbul Tahrir group, believed to be involved in circulating leaflets in Likoni,&rdquo; Likoni police boss Willy Simba said. The leaflets had been pinned on walls. Similar leaflets were distributed in Nyali constituency. Waithaka Macharia, who is vying for Nyali MP, said the leaflets are distributed by propagandists who only want to &ldquo;play games&rdquo; with Nyali voters. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m sure there will be no violence in Nyali,&rdquo; he said. Apostle Joseph Likiti of Global Arise and Shine Evangelism urged faithful to fast and pray for peace. &ldquo;The church has mobilised four million peace ambassadors,&rdquo; he said on Sunday.In the run-up to the 1997 election, more than 70 people were killed at the Coast and 100,000 evicted from their homes in violence that started in Kaya Bombo.
