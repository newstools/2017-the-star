The revival of African Bar Association (AfBA) has not come without challenges, as a section of the legal fraternity challenges its legality.Critics dismiss the possibility of its revival, saying the association was dismantled 15 years ago (in 2002).AfBA is said to have merged with other organisations to form the Pan African Lawyers Union (Palu).Palu president Elijah Banda says the legal associations created before the 21st century were dismantled to create a stronger association, leading to the birth of the Palu.In a statement, Palu says: &ldquo;At the turn of the millennium, a group of far-sighted African lawyers began conversations across the continent, which culminated in the merger of existing lawyers&rsquo; associations into a single, multilingual, continental lawyers&rsquo; body on September 9, 2002, in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The Bar leaders and eminent lawyers present in Addis Ababa on that day signed a Constitutive Act, establishing Palu.&rdquo;EXPRESSLY DISSOLVEDBanda says AfBA was one of the many associations that were then dismantled. The last president of ABA, the (late) Peter Adjetey from Ghana, became the first President of Palu; and its last secretary general, Femi Falana from Nigeria, became the first secretary general of Palu. The dismantling is attributed to the weak associations due to the small number of lawyers then, as well as the significant cost, and other difficulties, of travel across the continent at the time.&ldquo;The &lsquo;Anglophones&rsquo; had an African Bar Association (ABA). The &lsquo;Francophones&rsquo; had a separate one, and so on, the then leadership of the ABA expressly dissolved it, signed the Constitutive Act of Palu, and merged the then ABA into Palu as a consequence,&rdquo; the statement reads.Palu dismisses the association&rsquo;s revival, saying it is wrong and illegal, as the organisation had not pulled out of the agreement to establish the merger.&ldquo;It is incorrect to say that they are &lsquo;reviving&rsquo; a body whose leadership deliberately dissolved for the greater good of Africa, and that (former) leadership still exists and reiterates this, It is also incorrect, and possibly unethical, to go around the continent, engaging currently elected Bar leaders and telling them that their Bar Associations/ Law Societies had been active members of the (current) AfBA! The ABA that existed, and which some Bar Associations/ Law Societies may have been part of, no longer exists,&rdquo; the statement reads.In the last six years, Palu, has recruited over 35 life members, and over 1,000 ordinary members.FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATIONHowever, Article 10 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples&rsquo; Rights says African lawyers are entitled to form as many organisations as they want, and to name them as they wish.Over the last 13 years, and certainly over the last six years in which Palu has had a secretariat, the Palu leadership have ensured to be in all five regions of the continent.The union operates in the official languages of the AU and actively engages regional lawyers&rsquo; associations and national lawyers&rsquo; associations (who make up its corporate membership), as well as individual lawyers (who are welcome into its individual membership).
