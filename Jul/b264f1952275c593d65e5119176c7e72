The 13km Outer Ring Road has been opened to traffic ahead of project completion in September.The road runs from Taj Mall to Ruaraka.Kenya Urban Roads Authority chairman Daniel Waithaka and director general Silas Kinoti opened the road yesterday and said the project is 83 per cent finished.The Sh8 billion project undertaken by Chinese contractor SinoHydro Tianjin Engineering Company has upgraded the road to a dual carriageway to expand its traffic carrying capacity and reduce gridlock.&ldquo;The project is 83.1 per cent complete. We are waiting for the completion of interchanges at Jogoo Road and works on some sections of service roads,&rdquo; Kinoti said.The construction was launched by President Uhuru Kenyatta in January 2015 and was expected to be complete today. But this was revised due to relocation of water and sewer lines, land acquisition and encroachment on the corridor.The road will serve residents of Baba Dogo, Kariobangi North and South, Lumumba, Umoja, Dandora and Huruma estates.Project resident engineer Narayan Bhattarai said the contractor is putting final touches on some footbridges and installations.He added that the project will be completed in early September and &ldquo;officially launched on September 17&rdquo;.&ldquo;What is remaining is small work on service roads, landscaping, electrification [street lighting] and improvement of footbridges,&rdquo; Bhattarai said.He said the contractor is also putting up some amenities, including a Sh868 million wholesale market, children&rsquo;s park and health centres, along the road,&rdquo; Bhattarai said.&ldquo;These would take about 10 months to complete.&ldquo;We will build a market on Kangundo Road and a children&rsquo;s park, but the problem is land in some areas. We hope to complete the work in 10 months if all these are provided.&rdquo;&ldquo;This road is expected to improve accessibility to Eastlands, reduce time travel for commuters and improve property value, and the business environment for formal and informal traders,&rdquo; Kinoti said.The road connects Thika Road and North Airport Road. It passes through Eastlands. At least 100,000 vehicles use it daily.Kinoti said KURA had constructed about 300km of roads in major towns since 2013, with 150km being done in Nairobi alone.He cited Ngong Road, Komarok, Nanyuki, Lunga Lunga and Enterprise roads.Kinoti added, &ldquo;Plans are underway to dual the Eastern and Northern bypasses to blend with the rising demand for improved infrastructure and economic growth.&rdquo;
