Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua has written to Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet to investigate his rival Wavinya Ndeti over an alleged plot to burn the county headquarters. Mutua has also asked National Cohesion and Integration Commission chairperson Francis ole Kaparo and IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati to closely monitor and act on Ndeti’s alleged utterances, writings and social media activities “to prevent incitement and violence”. The two are the frontrunners in the county top job race. Ndeti is running on the Wiper ticket. They have been trading accusations as campaigns hot up in the run-up to the August 8 polls. Mutua has copied the letter to  the International Criminal Court prosecutor Fatou Bensouda. Last week, Ndeti wrote an open letter to Boinnet, alleging a plot to burn county buildings and documents to avert criminal investigations. She said there is a plot to torch the headquarters between July 5 and 8 “to destroy financial and procurement records as part of a wider scheme to cover up” economic crimes. But Mutua yesterday said there could be “a political and criminal” plan by his opponents to frustrate the county government by burning the buildings to justify the content of the letter to gain political mileage. The Maendeleo Chap Chap leader said Ndeti is engaging in campaigns that are likely to cause violence “as she urges nonresidents to leave the county”. “Nothing can be more derisive, absurd and far-fetched than this claim,” he said in a statement issued to journalists in Machakos by his press secretary Mutinda Mwanzia. Domestic terrorism Mutua said his office has invited the EACC to assist in establishing an ethical governance system in the county. “Investigations and queries have been welcome to enhance transparency and accountability in government operations,” he said. The incumbent added that it is against national and international laws to internally displace people for political or any other gain. “Be they from Makueni, Kitui or any other part of Kenya, we must not allow  these dangerous political games,” Mutua said. He described residents as tolerant and peace-loving people, expressing  concern that some politicians are hell-bent on destabilising the county to breach the peace for their selfish gain. Mutua said arson, especially in relation to public property, is clearly an act of domestic terrorism, whose sole aim is to create fear and despondency among the peaceful citizens of Kenya. “It is an act of civil provocation to strife and unrest reminiscent of the 2007 post-election violence,” he said.
