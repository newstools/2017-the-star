Singers Nameless and Wahu are proud parents to two of their lovely daughters; firstborn Tumiso, who will be turning 11 years in August, and in the same month, the little one in the family, Nyakio, will be turning four years.In a recent interview with Word Is, Nameless revealed that one of the things he hates about his wife is how she takes longer to prepare and leave the house when they are going out, saying he has to lie about the event time so they don't get late.When asked if he wants to add another child to the family, he said it's the topic of discussion between them, revealing that he really needs a son and would really love to have one."Eeh, usiseme by the way (giggles). Hiyo ndio topic ya discussion kwa nyumba, juu tunadiscuss, 'do you want another one' Me I'm like 'yeah I want another one', but nataka boy, because I love my girls."He continues to giggle as he goes on to explain why needs a son badly. "My two girls, plus my wife, lakini, I need a boy in that house, unajua, unakuwa overpowered eeh! So I'm like, 'I want another one as long as long as kuna guarantee, ubaya hakuna guarantee. Ama kuna guarantee na sijui. Me natafuta all guarantees in formular, hapo naweza jaribu."The father of two then winds up by saying, "I would have to have one. To be honest, I would really love to have a son."
