It was only after girls started giggling and “acting funny” did teachers at Dede Secondary School realise they were excited over a sex orgy they had enjoyed the night before. Five to 10 boys from Manyatta Secondary School are believed to have hiked 34 kilometres on Sunday night  to the girls’ hostel housing about 100 students. The educators and guardians of the girls’ morality had been clueless about the goings-on. Eleven girls were suspended. The boys left around 9pm after preps and upon arrival they sneaked into the girls’ dormitory. It is believed the students organised the party through mobile phones, which are banned. It is also believed the midnight frolics are a regular occurrence. “The orgy was planned by Form Four students who allowed the boys in the hostel, and only left after midnight,” a girl from St Mary Goretty’s told reporters. She has been suspended. An administration official at the girls’ school said 11 students were suspended on Monday. They are expected to report back on July 17 to face the school’s board of governors for disciplinary action. The suspended students are in forms one through four. “Unfortunately, we did not hear commotion from the hostel throughout the period the orgy was going on. “Teachers only got wind of it during the school assembly when some girls acted funny and appeared to be overexcited. Upon investigation, the sad truth started to unravel,” the administrator said. On Tuesday, St Mary’s principal Lucy Odera declined to comment, saying the party is under investigation. At Manyatta High School, principal Evans Baraza termed the incident “shameful”, and said they too are investigating.
