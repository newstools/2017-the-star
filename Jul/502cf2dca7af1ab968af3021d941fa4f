They were so excited as their international flight landed at the JKIA. Soon this tour group of 10 had cleared the airport and settled in a nice hotel. They had a day to spare, so they decided to visit the unique world famous Nairobi National Park.At just before 0600h on a cool pleasant morning they arrived at the main gate, and each paid the expensive $40 day fee. The game drive started off wonderfully, as their tour drivers were well connected and informed them that there was a lion kill in the Kingfisher area, near junction no 30. After enjoying the lions and many other species for the first time ever, the tourists headed to the Kingfisher picnic spot where they were able to safely get out of the tour vans and have a packed hotel breakfast. After enjoying their breakfast, some of the tour group members needed to answer nature&rsquo;s call. The information tour guide directed them towards a small hut surrounded by a few bushes.After they left the picnic spot there was a hushed silence in the tour van, then eventually someone spoke out, and said &ldquo; I cannot believe that tourists are being forced to use toilets that are extremely substandard, unclean, unhygienic and with a putrid smell. Sadly their experience of what could have been an incredibly wonderful event was tainted by the terrible toilets.It is very clear that the toilets inside the park at the various picnic sites are some of the worst many people have experienced anywhere! Sadly, it has become a whispered shame about KWS. Clearly serious action is urgently required to upgrade and maintain toilets to acceptable hygiene standards.The park is open daily from 06h00 to 19h00.For more information on the park you can link to the following websites www.kws.org or www.nairobigreenline.com or on Facebook.
