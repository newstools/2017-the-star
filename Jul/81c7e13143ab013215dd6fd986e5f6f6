When it comes to making up after a fight, men and women have very different expectations.A new study has shown that women would prefer men to dedicate quality time and cry while asking for forgiveness.But in contrast, men consider a kind gesture or receiving a sexual favour as the best form of apology.Researchers from Bucknell University in Pennsylvania investigated the best ways of reconciling a conflict between romantic partners.In their study, male and female participants completed an online questionnaire that asked them to choose specific actions that they would do to make up with their partner after a fight.Their answers were grouped by the researchers into 21 categories of possible behaviours.These were then given to a second group of participants who were asked which methods they preferred.The results showed that men rated a partner doing nice gestures and giving sexual favours as most effective.Dr Joel Wade, lead author of the study, said: "Women may thereby use sexual favours as a way to reconcile with their male partner."Doing so may communicate to their male partner that they are still sexually accessible and as such do not want to end the relationship."In contrast, the results showed that women preferred when their partner spent time with them after a fight, apologised and even cried to show their remorse.Dr Wade said: "Women may rate spending time together more highly because this behaviour signals a partner's willingness to invest effort and limited resources (e.g. time) into their romantic pair-bond."Such actions by a man may signal the likelihood of a potentially high parental investment which women prefer." The researchers suggest that women may view male partners who cry and apologise as being in touch with their emotions, without being too feminine.Dr Wade added: "Women may find the act of their male partner apologising to be an effective reconciliation tactic because it is viewed as an altruistic act."A man's apology may redirect the cost of romantic conflict to himself rather than to his partner and thereby demonstrate his ability to provide emotional support and incur personal costs for his partner."
