Tusker coach George ‘Best’ Nsiimbe has hailed his team’s determination to better last year’s achievements after they overcame Palos FC to stay on course to defend their GOtv Shield they won last year. The brewers defeated the second tier outfit 1-0, thanks to a goal from Kenyan international forward Jackson Macharia. “The boys played very well against Palos though we had a lot of chances but again, we did not utilised them. This is a knockout tournament and we needed a win so that we qualify to the next stage and we have done it,” Nsiimbe said on the clubs official page in the wake of that victory at Kinoru Stadium. The double winners from 2016 are also firmly in contention to hold onto their league title as they are in second place below Gor Mahia on goal difference after suffering a loss at the hands of nine-man Bandari in the league last time out “The good thing I am happy about is that we have started regaining our winning touch,” Nsiimbe added. The brewers are firm favourites to reach the last eight of the Shield competition after they were drawn to play fourth division side Butterfly FC in the next round. The brewers also got a reprieve on Monday after Sony Sugar wrote to the Independent Disciplinary and Complaints Committee seeking to have their case against Tusker for illegal player tapping terminated. “Sony Sugar chairman Paul Orato informed IDCC on Friday that his club and Tusker had amicably resolved the matter and the sugar millers were no longer willing to continue with the case,” a statement form KPL read. The Awendo-based side had complained that Tusker made an illegal approach on four of their players contrary to KPL Policy Articles Section 5 and Articles 18 Section 3. The brewers had managed to secure the services of highly-rated Sony forward Boniface Muchiri, who was part of the Harambee stars squad that lost to Sierra Leone in the first match of the qualifiers for the African Cup of Nations.
