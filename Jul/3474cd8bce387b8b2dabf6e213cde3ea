President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto have asked the Kamba community to vote them back since Kalonzo Musyoka is not seeking the presidency.The two said at Matuu town on Tuesday that the August 8 race is between Uhuru and NASA's Raila Odinga.Kalonzo is the ODM leader's running mate hence a key participant in the presidential contest.But Ruto, during a stopover at Masinga, asked Kambas to vote for Uhuru on grounds that the former Vice President said he has no problem with the latter."I have heard my friend Kalonzo say that he had no problem with Uhuru but some few issues with me.""Because the race this time round is between Uhuru and Raila, I am asking him we first vote Uhuru in then we will sort out our differences in 2022," he said.The DP said that he will be ready to negotiate with Kalonzo for 2022 and if negations fail, they will face off in the polls."Kalonzo and I can agree on a formula in 2022 and in case we don&rsquo;t agree, we square it out. But for now, I am asking you Kambas to walk with us in forming the next government."Ruto said the Jubilee administration has achieved a lot in the region in its first term despite the region having voted for the opposition in 2013."In Machakos alone. we have done 260 kilometres of tarmac road and we have also connected 130,000 people to the national electricity grid," he said."We have also constructed the Yatta Canal which was last worked on during the colonial times."Uhuru exuded the confidence that he will defeat Raila and form the next government adding that there are clear indications of the same."If we were able to beat them in 2013 when we were out of government and with the burden of the ICC cases on our back, how now do they expect to beat us this time round when we are the ones running the government?""I have no problem with my brother Kalonzo, all I am asking him is to disassociate himself with that other fellow of 'Vitendawili' because he is taking him nowhere," Uhuru said.He hit out at the NASA coalition saying that it was a formation of people who had served long in the government but had nothing to show for wananchi."They say that they are for change, what change are they bringing if they did not do the canal for all those years they have been in power?"The President said that with the completion of the canal, the acreage of irrigation in the area had risen from 6, 000 to 25, 0000.Garissa MP Aden Duale, Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko, and other leaders accompanied the president and the DP.Also read: Jubilee bait will not hook Kambas, Kalonzo 'tosha' - Malombe
