For the last few days a number of escalating attacks in
Northeastern and Lamu have been blamed on al Shabaab. They include the
hijacking of a government Pajero carrying Public Works Principal Secretary
Mariam el Maawy. Al Shabaab has ambushed and killed many troops and police
since Kenya entered Somalia in 2011, but they have never gone for a bureaucrat
of PS Maawy’s seniority. The PS was rescued by KDF and lived to tell the tale,
despite being shot twice. Something is very wrong somewhere in the massive security
operation in the region, including Operation Linda Boni, which has seen the
vast forest bombed by KDF in recent days. Has this operation failed? Are the people conducting this
operation not up to the task? A massive failure of intelligence and the people in charge seems
to have occurred. How did Shabaab know the PS would in the Milihoi area on the
Lamu-Mpeketoni highway? What’s more, Shabaab, which has a versatile
media/propaganda arm, has yet to lay claim to many of these raids.
