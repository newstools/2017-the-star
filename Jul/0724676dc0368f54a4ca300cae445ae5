NASA presidential running mate Kalonzo Musyoka has dismissed President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto&rsquo;s remarks that he is the cause of poverty in Ukambani.In a statement yesterday, Kalonzo said this is a show of panic and desperation. He said he could not join UhuRuto because they have failed Kenyans and are a &ldquo;sinking ship&rdquo;.Kenya&rsquo;s Presidents have been Jomo Kenyatta, Daniel Moi, Mwai Kibaki and Uhuru and those are the ones to be held responsible for underdevelopment in any part of Kenya, he said.&ldquo;Ironically, even as the President and his deputy launched a tirade of attacks on me, his [Uhuru&rsquo;s] own Gatundu backyard fares no better than most parts of Ukambani and other rural areas of Kenya in general,&rdquo; Kalonzo said.He said Gatundu residents suffer from jigger-infestation and have resorted to drinking cheap killer brews because of poverty. &ldquo;Abject poverty, characterised by the debilitating jigger menace, as well as alcoholism and drug abuse pervade the area that so far prides itself on having produced two Presidents &mdash; Jomo and Uhuru,&rdquo; the former Vice President said.Kalonzo said the fact he was reelected four times as Mwingi North MP shows that residents had confidence in his leadership. &ldquo;They are trying too late to curry favours with a completely disgusted electorate that has already made up its mind to reject the extremely inept, blatantly corrupt and shamelessly tribal Jubilee regime on August 8,&rdquo; the Wiper leader said.He said UhuRuto&rsquo;s remarks that he has been in leadership for more than 30 years but done nothing for Ukambani was false and laughable.Kalonzo said the remarks show their frustrations, agony and bitterness after their repeated forays into the Lower Eastern region failed to produce tangible results.&ldquo;It is comical for Uhuru and Ruto to ask me to join them as they march towards opposition trenches, for that is surely where they will be after NASA takes over power after the polls on August 8,&rdquo; he said.The two leaders have failed Kenyans and are using blackmail to remain relevant ahead of the August polls, Kalonzo said.
