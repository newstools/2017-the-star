NASA leader Raila Odinga has promised Turkana residents oil proceeds if NASA forms the next government.During campaigns on Thursday, Raila accused President Uhuru Kenyatta of refusing to let development take place in the county."Governor Josphat Nanok amesema mafuta ya huku mpaka itumike ili kusaidia wananchi wa Turkana. Tutamizi hayo." (Nanok has said the oil produced here must help residents. We will ensure we fulfill this when we form the next government)In March, the President exchanged words with the Governor over allocation of funds and the proceeds.Uhuru called Nanok a fool and a devil after the Governor accused the government of allocating Turkana insufficient devolution funds.An agitated Uhuru, who spoke in Kiswahili, also responded to claims that he has interests in the county's oil.He said no one should tell Kenyans the lie about him needing oil belonging to others.[AUDIO] Uhuru calls Nanok a foolish devil for raising queries on oil wealthRaila said the problem between Nanok and the President concerns the county's oil."Wabunge walipitisha sheria ya kuwa 10 per cent oil proceeds itumike hapa lakini Uhuru alikataa kutia sahihi akasema anataka ipunguzwe," he said.(MPs passed a law for 10 per cent oil proceeds to be used here but the President refused to sign the legislation saying the percentage needed to be reduced.)"Uhuru mwenyewe ndiyo alikataa pesa ikuje hapa Turkana. Mimi nikichaguliwa Agosti nitaweka sahihi hiyo sheria."(It is Uhuru who declined to give money to Turkana. I will sign the law allowing more county funds and better earnings from oil when we form government)Read: How Much Money Has Turkana County Received Since its Inception?The ODM leader said 30 per cent of the proceeds will remain in the county, not the five per cent offered by Jubilee.Raila further rooted for the rights of the country's single mothers with the promise of a low-cost housing plan for them.He said when elected, housing will be cheaper, therefore, affordable.Raila further promised free primary and secondary education for their children.Majority of single mothers live in slums or low income estates.More on this: Raila entices single mothers with cheap housing, special fund under NASA
