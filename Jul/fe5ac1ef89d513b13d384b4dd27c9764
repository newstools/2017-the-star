The media should stop fuelling political conflicts in the counties and instead report facts objectively, the IEBC has said.Siaya returning officer Ruth Kalundu said journalists must report facts.&ldquo;It appears there is a well-coordinated and spirited move by sections of the media to depict ongoing campaigns in a bad light and we will not endure this,&rdquo; she told journalists after meeting Siaya politicians at the IEBC office.Kalundu said most stories about the Siaya chaos seemed to incite ODM candidates against independents.&ldquo;We cannot allow this anymore. The media must advance the truth and explain the facts as they are to propagate the democracy and pragmatism the IEBC stands for,&rdquo; she said.When Kenya burns, everyone in the country will be consumed, Kalundu said.The IEBC has partnered with the police to arrest inciters.Siaya county commissioner Josephine Onunga urged the media to be responsible and objective in reporting.
