Sharp differences between President Uhuru Kenyatta and opposition chief Raila Odinga&rsquo;s allies nearly paralysed an IEBC forum on ballot papers yesterday.The meeting was further polarised by revelations that the IEBC had moved to the Court of Appeal to challenge Friday&rsquo;s ruling that terminated the award of the Sh2.5 billion printing tender.Jubilee bigwigs, led by National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale and his Senate counterpart Kindiki Kithure, insisted it is inappropriate for poll participants to discuss who gets the tender.&ldquo;We have no interest in who gets the job. We don&rsquo;t care who gets it. Even NASA can be given that tender if they so wish, but what we are engaged in could be prejudicial to the procurement law,&rdquo; Kindiki warned.But in a memorandum sent to the IEBC, the NASA team suggests that the process of selection of the vendor should involve participation by representatives of presidential candidates.In the memorandum by head of Raila Odinga presidential secretariat Willis Otieno, NASA argues that the Procurement Act allows for appointment of an ad hoc committee, as well as inclusion of the technical expertise from outside.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s our view that the supply of presidential elections ballot papers should be awarded to a reputable international company with a long history of provision of similar services to modern democratic states,&rdquo; the NASA letter states.&ldquo;Al Ghurair Company should not be considered as a supplier of presidential election ballot papers and declaration forms.&rdquo;Siaya Senator James Orengo had refused to publicly discuss the contents of the memorandum at the Hilton Hotel, triggering a protest from Jubilee that NASA was playing a secret card.IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati intervene several times to cool tempers.Thirdway Alliance presidential candidate Ekuro Aukot asked Chebukati to ensure the meeting does not degenerate into a Jubilee-NASA contest.&ldquo;This meeting needs prayers,&rdquo; interjected presidential candidate Abduba Dida. &ldquo;There are meetings I usually refer to as shameful and this is one of them.&rdquo;On Friday last week, a three-judge bench nullified the tender for the printing of presidential ballot papers.Yesterday, Aukot warned that the IEBC was using them for public relations. &ldquo;If you are appealing [the ruling], let&rsquo;s not waste each other&rsquo;s time &hellip; Let&rsquo;s go battle this in court,&rdquo; he said.
