Agriculture CS Willy Bett has said more than three million bags of maize have been imported, enough to meet households&rsquo; demand in July.Speaking at the Port of Mombasa on Friday when he received 42,000 metric tonnes of maize, Bett said there is no cause for panic.&ldquo;We have enough maize supply in the country. The only challenge is we have to ensure it reaches millers on time,&rdquo; Bett said.He said since the country started importing maize, some two months ago, more than 143,000 metric tonnes have been shipped in.Another 260,000 metric tonnes are expected this month. The CS says they have put structures in place to ensure imported maize goes to millers and consumers. &ldquo;Kenyans do not need to panic. The rush to buy all stock from supermarket shelves should not be there because Kenya has enough maize now,&rdquo; Bett said.He said several ships carrying maize will dock at the Port of Mombasa for two weeks. Bett said there is a possibility of extending the importation window period from July 31 until the next harvest.Parliament in May passed a bill that allowed importation of subsidised maize up to July 31.&ldquo;We still have a challenge after the fall of the armyworm. We do not know when our next harvest will be, therefore, we might need to extend the importation period,&rdquo; Bett said.The CS said they have been working with large scale millers, but are now working with small millers in remote areas to supply them with maize.&ldquo;They [small millers] have to agree that they will not sell the maize for more than Sh35 per kilogramme,&rdquo; he said.The CS said to stop cartels that have been hoarding maize, the government has deployed government officials at the port, Grain Bulk Handlers and at milling firms. Grain Bulk handles all maize imports.The work of these officials is to ensure subsidised unga in the supermarkets is not diverted.Bett said the government has also engaged the services of the standard gauge railway freight train and several trucks to speed up the transportation of imported maize from Mombasa.Coast regional Coordinator Nelson Marwa, who was speaking at the Port of Mombasa, said the government has hired enough security officers to ensure trucks ferrying maize reach their destination without hiccups.&ldquo;We have enough officers escorting these trucks and the train,&rdquo; Marwa said.&nbsp;
