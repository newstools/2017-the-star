NASA has denied claims that its campaigns are financed by corruption cartels and NGOs that are accountable to no one. ODM chairman John Mbadi, accompanied by other NASA leaders, on Thursday said they are financing their campaigns in a transparent manner through members&rsquo; contributions. On Wednesday Deputy President William Ruto said the alliance cannot fight corruption because it &ldquo;is literally owned by corruption cartels&rdquo;. But the NASA officials said President Uhuru Kenyatta, as head of state, has all the power and resources to name the groups funding NASA campaigns. &ldquo;Why have you not named the groups. Don&rsquo;t be a rumour-monger,&rdquo; nominated MP Oburu Oginga said. The leaders spoke in Rabuor, Kisumu county, where Nyando MP Fred Outa launched campaigns for his Senate bid. They said they are certain NASA will win the presidency.
