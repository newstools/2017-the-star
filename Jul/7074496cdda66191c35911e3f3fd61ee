Kenyan acting pioneers of the popular TV shows Vitimbi and Vioja Mahakamani have lamented at the lack of government support for their craft, especially with funds. Speaking to Word Is, Mary Khavere (Mama Kayai), Lucy Wangui (judge) and Gibson Kamau (prosecutor) explained what projects they are working on and why you will not be seeing them in the TV shows. “It is unfortunate that Kenya has no policy that supports actors, which would have a designated budget that would help in the growth and development of the entertainment industry as government support,” Gibson said. Commenting on why the older cast of Vioja Mahakamani left the show, Lucy, who played the no-nonsense judge, said that “when the cast of Vitimbi was told to leave due to their old age, we quit in solidarity as we are a family”. That explains why the show now has younger faces, including Nice Githinji, Dr Ofweneke and Aliwah. The departing cast credited their success as actors to hard work and passion, saying that’s what has made them household names and icons in the industry. In Vioja Mahakamani, they explained that the TV show had already created a mark in the entertainment industry. They say the new casts cannot match up to what they had created, because people watched Vioja to see them. Frustrated by the turn of events, they decided to venture out on their own. Their new show will see them seek out new talent, mentor them and act with them in their new show called Jungu Kuu, which premiered on K24 on Sunday.
