Newborn twins died on Saturday in Wekelekha village, Bungoma South, after their mother was barred from re-entering the homestead, as she would bring in &ldquo;a bad omen&rdquo;.The mother sought rest in a maize plantation near the homestead, where the twins died some hours later.Killing babies in the name of tradition cannot be allowed to continue in this day and age.Two things must follow: One, the national government, using the county administration, should stamp it out. Two, religious leaders and other culture-change agents should educate and persuade the people to embrace change.Infanticide is murder.The same effort that has gone into campaigning against female genital mutilation and the lynching of old people on suspicion of witchcraft should be exerted on killers of twins.However, force is hardly ever the best means to change culture. Concerted civic education is what will bring about lasting change.It may be necessary to have rescue centres within communities that still practice infanticide, where mothers and babies can find refuge.
