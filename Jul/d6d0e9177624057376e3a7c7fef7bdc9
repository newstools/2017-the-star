NASA presidential flag bearer Raila Odinga on Tuesday received a rousing welcome in Kiambu county, a place perceived to be President Uhuru Kenyatta's home turf. Raila, who was accompanied by other NASA co-principals, attracted a large crowd as he passed through Limuru. Residents were eager to listen to the Opposition leader's pledges ahead of the August 8 polls. "... sisi tunamkaribisha Raila akuje atuambie manifesto yake na atuambie kitu atatufanyia akikuja," a resident known as Nicholas said. He said the presidential candidate should tell Kiambu residents what he has in store for Kenyans in his manifesto and when he gets the seat being contested by one of their own. "... anafaa aunganishe Wakenya kama anataka apate hii cheo," he added. "[Raila] should also bring Kenyans together if he wants to win the presidency."  /COURTESY  /COURTESY Another resident said he wanted to see and hear from Raila. "... mimi natamani kumwona uso kwa uso akikuja huku na pia tunatarajia aonge kuhusu sera (I would love to see him. He should explain his policies to us)," the resident said. Earlier, Raila assured the Kikuyu community that they will be more secure and happier under his presidency. He said he will defend everyone's rights once he takes over from Uhuru. "We must make Kenyans [understand] there are 43 different communities...none should feel inferior or superior to the other," Raila said.

Raila said NASA aims to send home “the inefficient, incompetent and corrupt Jubilee regime” in the August polls. He has been making forays in perceived Jubilee strongholds, a deviation from his earlier style of concentrating on his support bases. Read: Raila receives 13 Kiambu defectors ahead of NASA tour
