Cash inflows from Kenyans living abroad are likely to increase as the country moves towards the August 8 polls, analysts have said.&ldquo;Remittance should increase as we gear up for elections as it comes to support households. Based on previous data we may likely experience stagnation during the actual election period,&rdquo; Standard Investment Bank head of research Francis Mwangi told the Star on phone.Month on month cash inflows sent by Kenyans living abroad dropped 6.05 per cent to $138.60 million (Sh14.39 billion) in April from $147.53 million (Sh15.32 billion) in March, Central Bank data has shown.Fresh data collated by the CBK shows that value of remittances in April 2017 also declined 3.43 per cent compared to $143.53 million (Sh14.90 billion) reported during the same period last year.&ldquo;If you look at our key source markets, North America and UK, there have been a lot of geopolitical uncertainties such as the US election and Brexit. These could be the reason for the slight drop,&rdquo; Stanbic Bank regional economist Jibran Qureishi said yesterday. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think the drop in remittance is likely to become a trend in the coming months, even as we get closer to the elections.&rdquo;Qureishi said that the country&rsquo;s economic slowdown characterised by decreased lending to the private sector by commercial banks, the prolonged drought that lasted up to five months and mass retrenchments in firms across the country were more likely to result in a spike in the value foreign cash inflows.&ldquo;When there are economic challenges, there&rsquo;s increase in remittance. Kenyans abroad are more likely to send in money to aid their families through these tough economic times,&rdquo; Qureishi said.Diaspora remittance has over the past three years emerged as the country&rsquo;s leading source of foreign exchange surpassing tourism, tea and horticulture exports.Dollar inflows from Kenyans living abroad grew 2.16 per cent for the four months ending April to $571.20 (Sh59.30 billion) from $559.11 (Sh58.04 billion) during the same period last year.
