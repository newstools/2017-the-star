One of the promises being peddled by the NASA brigade is that Raila Odinga will back Kalonzo Musyoka against the Jubilee candidate &mdash; expected to be Deputy President William Ruto &mdash; in 2022.The carrot being dangled as evidence for this support is the existence of a signed agreement that has been deposited with the Registrar of Political Parties.This has been a well-rehearsed narrative that NASA presidential candidate Raila has perfected as he seeks votes from the strategic one-million-plus votes from the Kamba nation and its diaspora.Fact: There exists a signed undertaking between Kalonzo&rsquo;s Wiper and ODM, but this agreement is studiously silent on the role NASA founder Musalia Mudavadi and Ford Kenya chair and coalition co-principal Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula will play in 2022. And therein lies the problem.After years in the political wilderness, Mudavadi will be at his political peak in 2022, regardless of the outcome of the August 8 poll.Political observers, even those without a sharp political eye, will have noted that Mudavadi has been the source of political energy in the NASA team. He has variously played the role of working up the crowds in a manner that has surely made the late Otieno Kajwang&rsquo; literally spin in his grave in envy.His speeches have also been very mature lately, and he has given the NASA team a calming effect as the polls near.Mudavadi has seen it all in politics. As a blue-eyed 29-year-old, President Daniel Moi appointed Mudavadi to the Cabinet after reclaiming his late father&rsquo;s Vihiga seat in 1989. He remained in the Cabinet until Moses Akaranga trounced him in 2002.He bounced back in the 2007 disputed poll as Raila&rsquo;s running mate, and was named minister in the subsequent government.He went it alone in 2007 and lost heavily to Uhuru Kenyatta, not withstanding the drama that preceded the poll as he appeared undecided on whether to back Uhuru in the event that should the ICC bar the duo from taking office, he would be the man to occupy the prestigious House on the Hill.Mudavadi may be younger than Kalonzo. But they joined Parliament in 1989 and 1985 respectively. This in effect means that, politically, Mudavadi and Kalonzo come from the same generation and are therefore political age mates.In a country where political fatigue over the longevity of a stay in the political space is emerging, Mudavadi will certainly feel inclined to give it a shot after Raila in 2022, and may not want to play second fiddle to Kalonzo, even if they deposit another political agreement in 2022.There is also the furious emergence of ambitious and energetic politicians across the country.The likes of Governors Hassan Joho (Coast), Peter Munya (Mt Kenya) and Isaac Rutto (Rift Valley); Senators Omar Hassan, Mutula Kilonzo Jr and Mike Sonko, among others, means that there will be no shortage of running mates in 2022.Which takes us to the next big thing. During the NASA talks for flagbearer, there was an overwhelming concern among Kalonzo diehards that he was shortchanged. Those in the know cited the existence of an MoU that indicated Raila would back Kalonzo in this election.Somehow, this was swept under the carpet and Kalonzo willingly accepted to play political ball with Raila under circumstances only the former appears to know.For some reasons, Kalonzo&rsquo;s supporters appear to be politically blindsided by the political developments taking shape nationally.They look helpless before the singular fact that even the power-sharing in NASA is skewed against them, with Kalonzo&rsquo;s Wiper being consoled with the Foreign Affairs docket.Mudavadi&rsquo;s critical position in NASA will see him control Internal Affairs, Wetang&rsquo;ula Economic Coordination and Rutto Devolution.The Internal docket, for starters, is a government within government. This means Musalia, being the rejuvenated political fox he has become, will have unfiltered access to security briefs long before Kalonzo gets his purely on a need-to-know basis.Many theories are floating in Ukambani as to why Kalonzo appears to have retained his relevance, despite a clear political low-tackle from Mudavadi. But all agree that the community may end up getting a raw deal in the event NASA wins.The community is alive to the fact that during his time as Roads minister and later as Prime Minister, Raila ensured that all Class A,B and C roads were tarmacked in Western and Nyanza, and did little to aid the upgrade of the Kibwezi-Kitui Road.Todate, this road is Kalonzo&rsquo;s Achilles&rsquo; Heel as he is said to have diverted funds for its construction to the Mwingi-Kamuwongo, a class C road, which has since been done.It is instructive to note that the government and SinoHydro Corporation are now upgrading this road at a cost of Sh5.7 billion. The government last week released the final allocation of its Sh850 million for the project, and works are now in full gear.Given that Kenyan politics are as fluid as their players, there is no denying the fact that other alliances and groupings all purporting to aid the deteriorating state of Kenyans will emerge.In 2012, Kalonzo famously said,&rdquo; &hellip;One cannot be a reformer and a thief at the same time&hellip;&rdquo; in reference to Raila&rsquo;s alleged involvement in the Kazi kwa Vijana fraud executed during the Nusu Mkate government.Now it is forgotten that Kalonzo, then Mwai Kibaki&rsquo;s Vice President, was a thorn in the flesh of the then Prime Minister. Interestingly, Kalonzo made the remarks after receiving Minority leader Francis Nyenze in his latter&rsquo;s Karen home.Some of Kalonzo&rsquo;s former allies, however, firmly say the Kamba community has paid him whatever political debt they owed him. They stood by him when he defected from Kanu to LDP in 2002, backed him when he split with Raila to join ODM Kenya in 2007, and anchored him as he joined the Kibaki side of Nusu Mkate as Vice President in 2008.Finally, when he launched his Wiper party and joined Raila for the 2013 ballot as his running mate, the community delivered 99.8 per cent of its votes to secure his future.In this election? It is time for political restitution by voting independent of Kalonzo, and his new political soul-mate, Charity Ngilu.Mulila is a political commentator
