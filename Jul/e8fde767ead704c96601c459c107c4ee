A 103-acre parcel owned by presidential candidate Cyrus Jirongo along the Kitale-Kapenguria road is to be sold at auction.Yesterday, an attempt to auction the farm failed after the auctioneers got Sh45 million as the highest bid. This was below the Sh70 million reserve price.The sale is said to have been prompted by failure to service a multimillion-shilling loan borrowed from the collapsed Dubai Bank.The property, registered under the name Kuza Farms and Allied Limited, was placed in receivership in November last year for the more than Sh495 million it borrowed from the bank.&ldquo;Under instructions received from our client, we shall sell the following property on July 5, 2017 at 10.30am at our office,&rdquo; a notice to the public read.The sale requires a buyer to pay a guaranteed sum of up to 25 per cent of the total amount on the day of auction and the balance within 90 days.Jirongo is in the presidential race on the UDP ticket.He has yet to hold any rally or public function since he was cleared by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission in May. Jirongo has also had a spat with Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli for failing to service another loan from the unionist.In 2013, Jirongo declared he would run for president, but later dropped his bid to back then-Cord candidate Raila Odinga.In 2014, Jirongo&rsquo;s 1,000 acres in Nairobi&rsquo;s Ruai were set for auction after a firm associated with him allegedly failed to service a loan borrowed from the collapsed Postbank Credit Limited.However, the businessman got a court injunction that stopped the bank from auctioning the land.Efforts to reach Jirongo for a comment were unsuccessful. He had not return our calls or text messages by presstime.The candidate once served as leader of the Youth for Kanu, a team tasked with mobilising support for the reelection of then-President Daniel Moi at the 1992 General Election. The Sh500 note was nicknamed the Jirongo, apparently because he used to dish it out to youth groups that helped to popularise Kanu in the run-up to the polls.Other candidates in the presidential race are incumbent Uhuru Kenyatta of JP, Raila Odinga of NASA, Ekuru Aukot of Thirdway Alliance, Abduba Dida of the Alliance for Real Change, and independent candidates Joseph Nyagah, Michael Wainaina and Japheth Kavinga.
