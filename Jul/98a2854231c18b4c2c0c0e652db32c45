Garissa Governor Nathif Jama will press defamation charges against Ethics and and Anti-Corruption Commission after the ethics body obtained temporary orders to to freeze the governor&rsquo;s First Community Bank account based on a Sh5.2 billion fake bank statement that surfaced online on Sunday.Nathif presented a certified bank statement from FCB to media showing he had Sh280,100 balance in his account as at January 1, 2015 contrary to the Sh2.8 billion indicated in the statement by EACC.Jama&rsquo;s statement has the bank letter head and details including excise duty and account maintenance, unlike the social media copy that only had transaction details and a rubber stamp purportedly from the bank.In another notable discrepancy, Jama&rsquo;s bank&rsquo;s statements show the account had no transactions between July 16 and July 30, 2015, and had a balance of Sh707,647.
