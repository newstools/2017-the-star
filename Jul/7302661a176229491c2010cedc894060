Homa Bay governor aspirant Oyugi Magwanga got a reprieve after IEBC gazetted his name among candidates taking part in the August polls. The Kasipul MP's name was omitted in the list which was first published by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission. The issue nearly sparked chaos in Homa Bay when his supporters learned of the anomaly in the candidate's roll. However, IEBC officials in the county assured Magwanga's backers that the matter will be resolved. Magwanga wants to unseat Cyprian Awiti who is seeking a second term through the Orange Democratic Movement party. "We are ready to face Awiti on the ballot. We are prepared to give the great people of Homa Bay new leadership," Magwanga said on Sunday. "We have overcome obstacles that have been placed on our path but we are glad we succeeded. We are more convinced that victory is on our side." Magwanga said he will endavour to run an administration which responds to the needs of Homa Bay residents. "I urge all my supporters to maintain peace because victory is ours. Let us abide by the law and follow the rules spelled out in the Elections Act." He urged his supporters to give NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga a rousing welcome as he visits the county on Monday. "Let us welcome Raila during his tour of the county. Let us maintain peace and accord him all the support," Magwanga said.
