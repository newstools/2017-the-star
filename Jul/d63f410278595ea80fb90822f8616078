The High Court in Nyeri yesterday dismissed Thuo Mathenge’s petition to be reinstated on the IEBC list of governor candidates. His name was struck off the list last month after the IEBC revoked his nomination clearance certificate. The issue is the authenticity of his academic papers. The court ruled the application was premature as Mathenge failed to follow procedure. “Instead of first directing his [petition to the] committee of the IEBC [IEBC Dispute Resolution Committee] in accordance with law, the applicant proceeded to institute judicial review proceedings in the High Court,” judge Abigael Mshila ruled. She said judicial review proceedings are discretionary and should only be issued where no alternative remedy is more efficient or suitable. “The applicant being aggrieved by the committee’s decision in revoking his certificate of nomination should have first utilised and exhausted the mandated process of the respondents [IEBC Dispute Resolution Committee] before making the instant application,” Mshila said. Mathenge sued the IEBC and Nyeri returning officer Aluisia Kanini. The the court ruled there was not a suitable case to provide judgment orders. Mshila said there was no evidence in court that Mathenge lodged any complaint with the IEBC over the revocation of the clearance certificate. Last week, through lawyer Kioko Kilukumi, Mathenge argued the electoral commission struck his name from the list of the gazetted names without giving him a chance to be heard. Kilukumi said the certificate was revoked and Mathenge called to pick it at the IEBC offices. This was before the Leadership and Integrity Vetting Committee invited him to give for his side of the story. He is an independent.
