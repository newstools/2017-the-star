Cases of robbery, theft and mugging are on the rise. Residents say the criminals are armed with knives, clubs, whips and metal bars and rob them of mobile phones, money and other valuables daily. “I met them when I was going home. They told me, ‘Excuse me, Lady.’ I stopped, but they took out a knife and ordered me to hand over my handbag, ransacked it and stole money, mobile phone, sweets and a necklace,” Miriam Waceke said. It was 8pm late last month. Waceke, who has moved out of her rented house, says she was ordered to pick her bag and go home quietly. family ties She reported the theft to the police but was told these cases are normal but residents do not report them for fear of families becoming enemies. A resident, who didn’t want to be named, said the criminals are from seven extended families that have dominated the area. Their young children are friends. “When someone is robbed and reports the incident to the police, they end up not following up on the case when they discover that the robber was a son of his cousin or a neighbour,” he said. Area deputy county commissioner David Kiprop has urged the residents to report the criminals, saying they will be investigated. “Our security personnel are well trained to handle residents’ information with confidentiality,” he said on Sunday. Kiprop said criminals thrive when residents do not report them to police.
