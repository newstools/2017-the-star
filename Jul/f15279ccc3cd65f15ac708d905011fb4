Metropolitan National Sacco, formerly Kiambu Teachers Sacco, has been named as the best cooperative in offering loan services with low interest in the country. This success follows the introduction of a scheme for low-income earners called Metro Boresha, in which loans are repaid using the check-off system from incomes. The sacco was named the best during this year’s Ushirika Day on July 1. Speaking in Kiambu town, CEO Francis Ng’ang’a said the sacco relies heavily on members’ support. “We educate them on the need to mobilise savings and the need for them to borrow and engage in economic projects,” Ng’ang’a said. The sacco is the largest in Kiambu county. ”The members have mobile banking services and ATM machines. That way they are able to transact without necessarily going to our branches, which are spread all over the country,” Ng’ang’a said. Githunguri Dairy Farmers’ Cooperative Society, makers of Fresha products and the third largest milk processing plant in the country, was named the best-managed cooperative.
