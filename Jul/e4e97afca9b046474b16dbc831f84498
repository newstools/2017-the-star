Jacaranda and San Valencia hotels will remain closed until they comply with requirements set by the government to stop the spread of cholera. Health CS Cleopa Mailu yesterday said the two food outlets have yet to be cleared to resume operations. “They were instructed on what to do. We’re helping them to overcome those difficulties so their hotels are open,” he said, adding that no facility is being victimised. The two facilities took to social media in self-defence immediately they were closed last week. The management of Jacaranda also claimed the hotel was open and continued to serve food to customers.
