An analysis of the 19.6 million eligible voters has put President Uhuru Kenyatta ahead of NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga by a commanding 1.2 million votes.In what could pose a big challenge in the opposition leader&rsquo;s State House quest, Uhuru would defeat him with 52.2 per cent against Raila&rsquo;s 47.7 per cent &mdash; avoiding a runoff.Based on the assumption that the voting patterns of 2013 remain during the August 8 polls, Uhuru would garner 8,568,551 votes against Raila&rsquo;s 7,334,697.If Raila is allocated all the 483,981 votes NASA co-principal Musalia Mudavadi got in 2013, he would narrow the 1.2 million votes difference with Uhuru to 749,873 votes.This is only if the voter turnout in all the 47 counties and the voting patterns of 2013 replicate in the August 8 polls. A lot has, however, changed since the last General Election. If taken into account, they might paint a different picture.For instance, three 2013 presidential candidates who got a combined 129,247 have dropped their bid and support Uhuru. These are Peter Kenneth, Paul Muite and Martha Karua.There have also been political realignments.NASA also appears to have made inroads in Rift Valley and the Meru region, which voted for Uhuru overwhelmingly. Other factors such as Jubilee performance might also come into play.In 2013, Uhuru beat then-Cord candidate Raila by 832,887 votes, but narrowly managed to avoid a run-off by just 8,000 votes.Uhuru&rsquo;s victory was attributed to a huge voter turnout in the Jubilee strongholds &mdash; Central and Rift Valley.Cord was hurt by poor turnout in its strongholds &mdash; Western, Nyanza and Coast regions.A projection of the August 8 presidential contest shows both have to push for huge voter turnouts in their strongholds if either side is to win.Raila has already launched &ldquo;adopt-a-polling station&rdquo; strategy to push his supporters to come out, cast their votes and protect them from rigging to turn the tables against Jubilee.An analysis of the figures indicates 5.2 million new voters were listed with Nairobi, Nakuru and Kiambu leading the pack in number of fresh voters.Select countiesIn Nairobi, where there are a total of 2.2 million registered voters, Uhuru would garner 862,864 votes against Raila&rsquo;s 904,392, going by the percentages they got in 2013.Uhuru had 46.7 per cent &mdash; 659,490 votes &mdash; against Raila&rsquo;s 49 per cent &mdash; 691,150.In Mombasa, Raila would be ahead with 269,691 votes against Uhuru&rsquo;s 91,958 votes.
