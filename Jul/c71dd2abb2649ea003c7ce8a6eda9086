Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi has accused Jubilee using security officials to intimidate residents against voting in the August 8 polls. He said Jubilee has threatened his acting county secretary by alleging that she was funding the Mombasa Republican council and al Shabaab. Kingi claimed that Bibi Fondo was arrested by detectives and questioned at the Mombasa regional CID offices. The Governor said if security officials have information about unlawful groups, they should investigate appropriately. "The security is in your hands. This time in Kilifi county, we want elections to be conducted peacefully," he said at a rally on Friday. He said the government had enough time to prepare for the polls and should not come out at the last minute "to talk of MRC". "The national government should learn how to manage security information; let them tell us the plan," he said. The Governor also accused the provincial administration of using civil rights groups tarnishing his name, saying they will not succeed.
