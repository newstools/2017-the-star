Jubilee Mandera leaders yesterday urged county residents living in Nairobi who registered at home to go back and vote during election as they plot to sweep the county clean on the August 8 General Election. Led by Governor Ali Roba, the leaders, calling themselves ‘Team Justice’, said they stand for peace and unity and exuded confidence the ruling party will carry the day in Northeastern. “We urge all the Mandera people who are here to confirm their registration details, and if you are voting in Mandera, please plan early and travel back. We want to win clean and we cannot do so without you,” he said. The governor criticised their opponents and elders for preaching violence and dividing residents ahead of the election. “Your vote is your right; please ensure you vote ... Elders cannot dish out leadership positions like food,” Roba said. “If you know that you are going to be in office for only one term, do you think you will work for the people?” He urged elders to reconsider the “negotiated democracy” method, saying it should not be universal for all leaders, but should be pegged on the performance of every elected leader every five years. Roba claimed that their opponents in the Economic Forum Party, led by Senator Billow Kerrow, have “sensed defeat and are now making divisive and inciting utterances.” “We want to send the EFP team home very early in the morning on August 8. From the MCA to the President; we want Jubilee,” he said. The governor was addressing hundreds of Mandera residents living in Nairobi at the Nyayo Basketball Court yesterday. Senator aspirant Mohamed Mamud said EFP is only out divide the residents. “This party has no head or tail. It has no presidential candidate ... We cannot advise our people to go to it,” he said. Lafey MP aspirant Isaac Ali said Jubilee has the numbers in the county and their opponents can only manage four per cent of the votes. “They are claiming that we took their 50,000 votes, to where? These people know they are losing and now they are spreading propaganda,” he said.
