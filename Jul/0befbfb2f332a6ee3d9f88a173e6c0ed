President Uhuru Kenyatta (pictured) leads in outlining tangible programmes for creation of employment for youths in his manifesto. Uhuru tops in a survey by Youth Agenda on specific actions each candidate intends to undertake to solve the unemployment that most youths are grappling with, trouncing his main challenger Raila Odinga of NASA. The President also beat Raila plans on ease of doing business for youths. The survey revealed that Uhuru and his Jubilee Party, and independent candidate Michael Wainaina have articulated their plans on youth better than others. The survey was carried out through a questionnaire to the four Presidential candidates—Uhuru, Raila, Third Alliance’s Ekuru Aukot and Independent candidate Michael Wainaina—who cooperated and had their manifestos available online. Youth Agenda CEO Susan Mwongera said Raila and NASA have captured job creation interventions but nothing in his manifesto highlights how the youth as a constituency will benefit. “Jubilee promises to expand youth participation in national development and guarantee 30 per cent of appointments, projects and budgets to youths,” she said. NASA “only” commits to establish a government that reflects representation of the Kenyan nation, including fair representation, which Mwongera said leaves a gap on what is in its store for the youth. Most young people are concerned with the measures that candidates will take in terms of establishing youth institutional and policy frameworks, she said. “Our findings were that only Jubilee and Prof Wainaina have outlined youth-related institutions that they propose to establish or expand,” Mwongera said.
