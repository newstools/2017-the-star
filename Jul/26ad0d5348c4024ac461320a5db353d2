Bungoma ODM governor candidate Alfred Khang&rsquo;ati has denied he is a Jubilee mole or receives money from the ruling party to scuttle NASA votes.The claim was made on Monday by NASA principal Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula, who is the Ford Kenya leader.&ldquo;So the cheap propaganda Ford Kenya are alleging that oh I have no money... Are they my wife to know if I don&rsquo;t have money to run? I could not just start from anywhere to vie for governor if I did not have money. That is stupidity,&rdquo; Khang&rsquo;ati said on Tuesday in Bungoma town.On Monday, during a Ford Kenya meeting in Kanduyi, Wetang&rsquo;ula said they have evidence Khang&rsquo;ati is being used by Jubilee to split NASA governor votes in favour of incumbent Kenneth Lusaka, the JP point man in Western.The meeting was attended by Ford Kenya secretary general Eseli Simiyu, Kanduyi MP Wafula Wamunyinyi, Ford Kenya governor nominee Wycliffe Wangamati and woman representative candidate Catherine Wambilianga.JP doesn&rsquo;t not PAY MEBut Khang&rsquo;ati dismissed the Bungoma senator&rsquo;s allegations, saying he has never received a cent from Lusaka or JP.He said he has been a Cabinet minister before, he is a renowned businessman and has his own savings and enough money to fund his own governor campaign.The former Kanduyi MP said he also has support from ODM, party leader Raila Odinga and well-wishers.&ldquo;I want to make this clear, there is nowhere our party leader Raila and ODM party candidates sat down and agreed to shelve our bids in favour of Ford Kenya. If they did agree so with Raila, let them go and ask him, as we are not aware of that,&rdquo; Khang&rsquo;ati said.On Monday, Ford Kenya party secretary general Eseli Simiyu urged Raila to ask ODM nominees in Western to step down for Ford Kenya and the ANC.But Khang&rsquo;ati said, &ldquo;We know that all of us here in Western who have been cleared by ODM and given certificates by the IEBC will be on the ballot come August 8. It&rsquo;s wananchi who will decide who among us will be the governor,&rdquo; he saidI have Raila&rsquo;s blessingsThe outspoken politician said when Raila went to Bungoma for the NASA rally, he brought him cash and campaign materials.Raila has said he will stand with all his ODM candidates in Western and support them to clinch more seats, he added.&ldquo;In fact, I say this so that they may feel it in their hearts &mdash; the money that I used when I was cleared by IEBC to set up campaigns and rallies, was given to me by Raila. And if they want to confirm, they can go to ODM offices on Capitol Hill in Nairobi [and] they will find my signature against huge amounts of money I was given,&rdquo; Khang&rsquo;ati said.He said he expects more money this week to be given through ODM deputy party leader Wycliffe Oparanya.&ldquo;My party leader came and took me in his chopper and we traversed the nine constituencies of the county campaigning. If he did not want me to be the governor, he would not have done so.&rdquo;
