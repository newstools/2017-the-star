The Star newspaper journalist Eric Oloo was yesterday roughed up by suspected hired goons who beat him senseless. Oloo sustained injuries in his jaws and his tooth was cracked in what appeared to be a well-planned attack. According to the scribe, he had gone to cover Nyanza NASA presidential campaigns headed by Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga and Siaya Senator James Orengo at Mwer trading center on Tuesday evening when he was attacked. Rasanga’s director of communication Bonny Odinga condemned the incident. Odinga denied the youths were allied to the governor. “The matter is under investigation. We want police to establish if the attackers are our supporters or not,” Odinga said on the phone yesterday. Oloo, who was in the company of the Siaya county KNA bureau chief Philip Onyango, alighted at the venue along the Siaya-Nyadorera highway and met some mean- looking goons. Oloo said the ringleader confronted him and demanded to know why he was writing negative articles, which elicited debate that went viral on social media. They singled out a story published in the Star on Tuesday where Governor Rasanga asked Rarieda MP Nicholas Gumbo, who is seeking to oust him, to blame his mother for marrying his poor father, hence his suffering in childhood. Oloo, who tried in vain to pump sense into the charged goons, faced their wrath when they pounced on him with kicks and blows. He took to his heels with the mob in hot pursuit, baying for his blood. Onyango’s pleas to the attackers to stop beating Oloo fell on deaf ears. Onyango sought help from a driver of a ministry vehicle who whisked Oloo away to safety and took him to a police station 6kms away. The journalist was treated at Siaya County Referral Hospital. The case was booked as OB/40/2/7/2017/ by police.
