Baringo county residents have accused police officers of shielding livestock thieves after identifying their stolen animals in the Mogotio market on Monday.The animals are alleged to be among more than 400 goats and cows stolen by suspected armed Pokot bandits during a spate of attacks in Yatya and Kagir villages in Baringo North subcounty in March and April this year.Police are said to have protected a woman from being lynched by angry residents, after they caught her negotiating prices with unsuspecting buyers in the market.The Tugens from Loruk, Baringo North, said livestock owners spotted special identification marks on their goats, particularly on the ears. &ldquo;We stopped to interrogate the woman but police whisked her away,&rdquo; said Richard Chepchomei, a resident.Chepchomei said it was not the first time they have seen their stolen animals being sold in the yard. &ldquo;It has now come to our notice that these Pokot bandits may have been colluding with police to loot and sell our livestock,&rdquo; he said.Marigat-based human rights activist Amos Olempaka threatened to mobilise residents to stage protests if police officers who support cartels behind livestock theft are not investigated.&ldquo;We cannot sit back and watch as police officers shield criminals who steal our livestock and walk scot-free,&rdquo; he said.Olempaka said he suspects more than 13,000 goats stolen from parts of Baringo North and Baringo South over the last two years were taken to a slaughterhouse. He called for a policy to govern the transportation of livestock in and out of the county.The activist urged Inspector General Joseph Boinett and Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery to intervene.However, Mogotio police boss Patrick Nyangaresi told the media his officers have not completed investigations and he will release a statement as soon as they are completed.
