The Nairobi Akamba Network Forum plans to ensure the majority of 300,000 voters from the Kamba community vote for President Uhuru Kenyatta at the upcoming election.The forum, with a registered membership of 3,000, on Friday vowed to campaign for Uhuru&rsquo;s reelection.Secretary general Jonathan Musau said Uhuru appointed Kambas to some key positions, despite the fact that the community did not vote for him in 2013. He said they want to avoid a repeat of what happened in 2013, when the community voted for Jubilee&rsquo;s Mike Sonko for senator, but cast their presidential votes for Cord&rsquo;s Raila Odinga.Musau said they have mapped out areas that are densely populated by the Kambas and will begin door-to-door campaigns and hold public forums to persuade them to elect Uhuru.
