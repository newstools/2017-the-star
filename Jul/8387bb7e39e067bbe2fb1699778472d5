About 1.2 million youth across the country have never gone to school, National Gender and Equality Commission has reported.In a Status of Equality and Inclusion in Kenya report launched yesterday, the figure translates to 11 per cent of youth aged between 18 to 34 years.The report says these youths are likely to remain uncompetitive in the labour market and susceptible to work in low productivity and low-paying jobs.The report, however, suggests that there is a need to enhance programmes such as the Kenya Empowerment to provide second-chance education projects to young adults so they can receive basic numeracy and literacy skills.About 21 per cent of youths aged 15 to 34 are non-utilised since they are uneducated, unemployed or untrained. In this bracket, those aged between 20 and 24 are worst affected.NGEC chairperson Winfred Lichuma said the figures show Kenya&rsquo;s future youths will not be equipped to effectively compete in the labour market.&ldquo;Given the challenges such as reduced employability, lower earnings and youth radicalisation, there is need to improve current youths employment,&rdquo; Lichuma said.Although county governments have improved Early Childhood Education, 70 per cent of children cannot access the facilities, which hurts pre- and post primary education.Girls are the majority of those dropping out of school due to early pregnancy and insecurity. However, the report has established that many boys have also been dropping out of school.&ldquo;We are simply calling for gender balance on how we can retain boys and girls in school. Doing away with exams is just one of the ways we recommend,&rdquo; Lichuma says.Regarding the unemployment rate, the NGEC chairperson said youths aged between 15-19 - and 20-24 stands at 36 per cent and 30 per cent respectively, a situation that has made many youths vulnerable and overdependent on handouts.Lichuma said female unemployment rates are generally higher compared to men. Unemployment rates in the key urban areas like Nairobi, Mombasa and Kisumu are higher for the working age population at 45 per cent for youths in the 20 to 24 age group.
