They are expected to report back on July 17 to face the school&rsquo;s board of governors for disciplinary action.The suspended students are in forms one through four.&ldquo;Unfortunately, we did not hear commotion from the hostel throughout the period the orgy was going on. &ldquo;Teachers only got wind of it during the school assembly when some girls acted funny and appeared to be overexcited. Upon investigation, the sad truth started to unravel,&rdquo; the administrator said.On Tuesday, St Mary&rsquo;s principal Lucy Odera declined to comment, saying the party is under investigation.At Manyatta High School, principal Evans Baraza termed the incident &ldquo;shameful&rdquo;, and said they too are investigating.
