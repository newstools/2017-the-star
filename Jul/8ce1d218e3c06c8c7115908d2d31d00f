A Lari MP candidate has urged leaders and residents to support reforms in the education sector. Njuguna Burugu yesterday said improving the quality of education will help market Kenya’s graduates and increase opportunities in the international job market. He praised the Education ministry for setting up a committee to coordinate the change from the 8-4-4 system to the proposed 2-6-3-3. Burugu said the changes in the current curriculum will enable children to discover their potential at an early age, and cultivate their ability so they have a better future. “If the quality of education is high, Kenya will not have to hire expats. Our citizens shall have the requisite qualifications needed by employers,” he said.
