Kenya Police spokesman Charles Owino has said corruption is not an isolated problem among traffic officers.He said in Kenya, graft is a societal problem that has permeated almost all institutions, and cannot be taken as an issue affecting a particular organisation or a department.Owino (pictured) said the challenge is that as law enforcers, police, who are few in number, are expected to tame corruption, which is embraced by the whole society, and this further entrenches the rot. &ldquo;We have been put in a situation where if you don&rsquo;t embrace corruption you will die,&rdquo; Owino says.He said society must lead the onslaught against corruption and cease blaming police because law enforcers are just a small fraction that has embraced the vice, adding they are a product of a corrupt society.&ldquo;If people are born to corrupt parents, grow up seeing corruption, go to a school where the principal did not merit to lead, then get employed as police, can they be expected to fight corruption?&rdquo; Owino said.&ldquo;How can you blame corruption in the whole country on police, while there are governors and other leaders required to be holders of university degrees, but are elected even though it is difficult to tell where and how they got the degrees?&rdquo;Owino said it is difficult to fight graft in Kenya as long as the people do not see anything wrong with it. &ldquo;If a PSV driver knows the capacity of his car is 14 or 28, then overloads and decides to have Sh200, Sh100 or Sh50 on hand to bribe the policeman on the road, how do you blame the policeman alone?&rdquo; Owino said.&ldquo;They only complain when an officer demands more than they are ready to offer. If they declined [to bribe] and allowed police to arrest them and take them to court, pay fines and that continues, the officers using arrests to intimidate them would realise there is nothing they will get and would start doing the right thing.&rdquo;Owino said police liaise with DCI officers to conduct sting operations on the highways where bribery is rampant to arrest officers caught in the act. &ldquo;We also liaise with the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission because that is largely their mandate and arrest some of them on our request,&rdquo; he said.
