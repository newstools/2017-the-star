By now, everyone knows who Naiboi is and has disregarded the Rapdamu era. Okay, just for a second, lets treat Rapdamu as an earlier personality that no longer exists. In this reality, it is a really sharp improvement from Michael Kennedy Claver.Right now he has carved out a nature, one where he has exhibited tremendous dexterity. He is better now, we boldly can confirm, and he is advancing the quality of music in the country.Since Goodlife, probably in 2010 when he came out as a young upstart, he never was part of any significant hit until 2016. This could be the case because he was on some creative dry spell. But now he seems to have mastered and perfected the art.Naiboi, who has also been in production at Pacho Entertainment, seems to have discovered a lot along the way and has turned into a powerful creator. In 2016, he did justice to the hit Gudi Gudi, a collaborative effort that included Everlast and Kristoff. Later in the year, he released his most spellbinding jam Problem. Now every track he is part of is worth having on your playlist.Naiboi does not express complex ideas in his music, but certainly, it will invite you to party. His sound is diverse, borrowing from Nigerian afrobeat, and it doesn't matter whether he sings or raps cause he will deliver. Instead of finding comfort in the bland Kenyan sound, Naiboi is exuding a different kind of musical wisdom. He understands that to be the best you have to stand out.
