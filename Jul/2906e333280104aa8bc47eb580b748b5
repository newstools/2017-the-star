Jubilee Party is planning to cut electricity supply in Mathare and Kibera in a new plot to rig elections, Opposition leader Raila Odinga has said. Raila has claimed the government is also planning to deploy soldiers to install Uhuru Kenyatta as the president if he loses the election. "There are plans to cut power and water in these counties in the pretext of containing cholera," he told a press conference on on Friday. He added: "The attempt by Uhuru to involve some members of our military to interfere with the August 8 election is illegal and amounts to a coup." Noting Kenyans are going to the election with a predetermined outcome, Raila said 226 military personnel are being trained at Mariakani barracks. "These new soldiers will readily take orders from authorities. This is unacceptable. We are not that stupid," Raila said. NASA co-principal Kalonzo Musyoka said Jubilee has enlisted loyal officers to subvert authorities in the poll. The Opposition has, on several occasions, accused the President of plotting to rig the poll using army. The Jubilee administration has denied the claims. Last week, NASA released names of 42 police officers he claims have been stationed as agents to cause chaos during elections. Opposition leader said the officers have been picked from units including GSU, Kenya Airport Police Unit, traffic and the dog unit. To perform the “special duties”, Raila said, their kits were withdrawn. "The officers have been assigned what the Kenya Police Service calls 'special duties' via a circular dated June 23," he said in a statement.
