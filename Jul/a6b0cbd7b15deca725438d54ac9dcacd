The public university lecturers and non-teaching staff strike has entered its third day, with their union vowing they will not return to work until their CBA is fully implemented.The lecturers and workers downed their tools on Monday to push for full payment of their Sh10 billion CBA.Speaking to the Star, Universities Academic Staff Union secretary general Constantine Wesonga yesterday said, &ldquo;We are on course and will stop at nothing until we see the Sh10 billion CBA is implemented in full and not in phases.&rdquo;In the pact signed in March, lecturers were set to receive a 17.5 per cent pay rise.Workers allied to the Kenya University Staff Union and the Kenya Union of Domestic, Hotels, Educational Institutions, Hospitals and Allied Workers were to receive a 24 per cent increment.Education CS Fred Matiang&rsquo;i last week urged the staff not to strike, adding that the government is ready to honour the deal.&ldquo;We have wired half the amount to the accounts of 31 public universities and colleges. The rest of the amount will come from the 2017-18 financial year,&rdquo; he said.The workers kept off their work-stations as others took to the streets to push the government to implement the CBA that was filed in court.More than 2,000 lecturers at Moi University have joined their colleagues in the strike.Uasu chapter secretary Chebii Kiptanui yesterday reiterated Wesonga&rsquo;s position that they will not return to work until all the money is paid. He cautioned the government against failing to honour the agreement.&ldquo;It has to abide by the CBA it signed with the union,&rdquo; Kiptanui said.In Kiambu county, Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Tecnology&rsquo;s non-teaching members also joined the strike.Led by their union officials, they said the government&rsquo;s commitment to fulfill the CBA is questionable.They have urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to intervene and find out who between those managing the Education ministry and the Treasury is sabotaging the deal.Uasu JKuat chapter secretary Nixon Chege and national treasurer James Makori accused the government of failing to honour its part of the bargain.&ldquo;We&rsquo;re telling the government to honour that pledge to avoid wasting students&rsquo; time. We&rsquo;ll remain out until such a time as the CBA is 100 per cent honoured,&rdquo; Chege said.
