Truancy in public schools in Changamwe, Mombasa county, has declined since the introduction of the government-sponsored free tablets for standard one and two pupils in March, a head teacher has said. Oscar Gullani, the head teacher of Umoja Primary School, said the institution and others in the constituency are recording almost 100 per cent attendance in lower primary. He spoke on Friday at a meeting with parents. Gullani told the Star, “Pupils are so excited with the tablets and the laptops and cannot afford to miss classes.” Learners’ interest in education is also said to be on the rise as children fall in love with the ICT gadgets easily. The ICT classes are always full. Gullani said they expect improved performance of public primary schools in national exams. PTA chairman Hemed Mukui said ICT has improves children’s performance, particularly in English and Science. “Schools with higher levels of e-maturity show rapid increase in scores, compared to those with lower levels,” he said.
