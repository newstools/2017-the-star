County
officials implicated in graft will be jailed if I win,
Kisumu governor candidate Anyang’ Nyong’o has said. He spoke during the Kisumu county economic governorship debate organised by
the Kenya Association of Manufacturers.Nyong'o faced the incumbent, Jack Ranguma. The
two leaders were taken through the policies they have as far as issues of good
governance, policy formulation and proper department management are concerned. However, corruption, underperformance and bad governance took center stage
during the discussion. Nyong’o
said corruption has become detrimental to the county’s development. He said a lot of money has been misappropriated under Ranguma's watch. “We can’t
allow people within the county government to squander public funds and not answer
to them," he said.
