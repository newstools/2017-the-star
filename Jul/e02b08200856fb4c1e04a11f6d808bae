IDPs from Bondo sub-county have warned the Jubilee administration against playing politics with their compensation issue.The victims of 2007/8 the post-election violence asked the government to let them be if it is not ready to compensate them.They told journalists in Bondo on Monday that they have questions on why only a few IDPs were compensated in the region and a majority of them sidelined.James Ngesa, Bondo IDPs coordinator, said the criteria used by the government to select beneficiaries from Nyanza region was suspicious."Why sideline more than 900 people who were displaced if the move to compensate us is genuine?" he asked.He added the amount of money they are being given is not enough enough and that it is easy to sense someone is playing politics with the initiative.Ngesa further revealed that out of the few individuals whose KCB accounts have been credited with Sh50,000, forty are not IDPs."The list from the bank contains names of people we do not know. We only know of IDPs in the original list that was presented to the government in 2009. The rest are Jubilee sympathisers."He said the Ministry of Interior, which was in charge of compensation, should explain to them why their issue is being politicised.Ngesa said they have been forced to demand explanations from Bondo deputy county commissioner Richard Ajwang."We are going to meet him on Wednesday. We want explanations on discrepancies in the list and when the remaining IDPs will receive their compensation."He addressed the press flanked by Usigu IDPs coordinator Francis Mayeya, who said they will hold demonstrations in Bondo town over the matter."We want our plight addressed peacefully. We don't want a repeat of violence especially now that we are approaching elections."During his last tour of the Gusii region, President Uhuru Kenyatta compensated integrated IDPs in Nyamira and Kisii counties.He paid IDPS from Kisii Sh358 million and those from Nyamira Sh470 million during the two-day tour.ODM leaders complained that the head of state was only bribing voters through the "late payment".Read: Uhuru 'bribing' IDPs with compensation, ODM MPs claimAlso read: Kisii MPs question source of money Uhuru is 'dishing out' to IDPs
