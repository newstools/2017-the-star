Kwale ODM candidates for governor and senator positions Issa Chipera and Issa Juma Boy, respectively, took their election campaigns to Jogoo Grounds in Gombato/Bongwe. They took a swipe at the current administration, saying it has failed to eliminate poverty and unemployment. Chipera promised to create jobs by ensuring there is a conducive environment for investors to establish industries in the county. &ldquo;We also have a problem with poor health facilities and lack of water. This will be solved once you elect ODM leaders,&rdquo; he said.Chipera said school fees for all bright students will be paid by the county government once he is elected.His running mate, Simeon Mkalla, who ditched Wiper candidate Chirau Mwakwere, said the current administration has done little compared to other counties. &ldquo;When you go to Kilifi, there are very many tarmacked roads, but in Kwale we have none,&rdquo; he said.Senate candidate Boy condemned those discrediting him, saying he is going for the seat as inheritance from his brother. &ldquo;When did we start inheriting seats for representation? You decided to nominate me and that&rsquo;s why they fear I will defeat them,&rdquo; he said.
