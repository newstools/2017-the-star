A woman in Bondo, Siaya county, is appealing for help to find her granddaughter who went missing three months ago. Lydia Achieng, 14, is a standard seven pupil at Ngulu Primary School. She last communicated with her grandmother Monica Oyolla in May through an SMS and a phone call. The call lasted less than a minute and she could not be reached afterward. “When a police officer at Lwala-Kotiende called her through the number she had used to send a text message, she said she was in Usenge town and her phone went off,” she said.  Oyolla has reported her granddaughter’s disappearance to Lwala-Kotiende and Bondo police and recorded statements. “When the officers investigated they traced the number, and discovered its owner operates between Usenge and Nairobi. We suspect the owner of the number could be a driver or a conductor of the buses plying Usenge and Nairobi route,” Oyolla said. She has also reported the disappearance to CID officers. Oyolla says she has had sleepless nights since her granddaughter’s disappearance, and is awaiting her safe return.  “My life is almost coming to a standstill,” she said.
