Raila Odinga has released names of 42 police officers he claims have been stationed as agents to cause chaos during elections.The Opposition leadersaid the officers have been picked from units including GSU, Kenya Airport Police Unit, traffic and the dog unit.To perform the &ldquo;special duties&rdquo;, he said, the officers' kits have been withdrawn."The officers have been assigned what the Kenya Police Service calls 'special duties' via a circular dated June 23," he said in a statement."They have been issued with clearance certificates and asked to report to headquarters to be issued with discharge certificates before July 2. Their identification cards have been withdrawn."Information at our disposal indicates these officers will be recruited as polling clerks of the IEBC."Police bosses have not responded to the claims.Noting the strategy is to make sure Jubilee remains in power, the NASA flag bearer said these are products of panic strategy meetings by the government."We have details of a [Nairobi meeting dated June 16], that an opinion poll commissioned by the NIS put the race at 30 per cent to 70 per cent in favour of NASA," he said.Raila said it was after this poll that Jubilee hurriedly formed a team to hold discussions."The recruitment of police officers into election activities falls within recommendations of the Jubilee team under scenario number two which was &ldquo;An Undisputable Raila Win,&rdquo; he said.He said the minutes of the June 16 Jubilee meeting described a Raila's win as &ldquo;tragic&rdquo; and said President Uhuru Kenyatta will reject the results and refuse to hand over power."It is under this scenario of a Raila win, which now looks increasingly likely, that the on-going activities fall."Read: Jubilee has sent 100 KDF soldiers to Kakamega in vote-rigging plan - RailaBOINNET MUST EXPLAINRaila demanded that IG Joseph Boinnet explains the nature of the special duties the police officers have been assigned."What is the current posting of the officers in question? What criteria was used to identify officers to be picked for these special duties?"The ODM leader also wants to know which other police officers are involved in special duty assignments surrounding the August 8 general election.He challenged Uhuru to go beyond mere rhetoric and demonstrate that he is prepared to play by the rules and respect the people's will."His manoeuvres indicate he is not prepared to respect the verdict of the people, contrary to his pronouncements," he said.On June 21, Raila claimed Uhuru was preparing to use the military to rig the August election to retain power.But the Office of the President denied the allegations.The Opposition chief claimed President enlisted the services of the armed forces and the National Intelligence Service to craft a winning strategy.Raila named Army Commander Robert Kibochi, Kenya Air Force Commander Major General Samuel Thuita, National Defence College boss Lt Gen Leonard Ngondi, Director of DCI Ndegwa Muhoro and Director General of National Intelligence Service Philip Kameru as being behind the vote-rigging plot.He also alleged an ongoing "suspicious" military training at the Embakasi Military Barracks, involving KDF officers, APs, county commanders and regional commanders.NASA has also claimed eight military officers have been trailing Raila and co-principals Kalonzo Musyoka, Moses Wetang'ula, Musalia Mudavadi and Isaac Rutto.More on this: Uhuru preparing military to rig the election, claims RailaAlso see: [VIDEO] NASA wants state to explain why 8 military officers are trailing Raila
