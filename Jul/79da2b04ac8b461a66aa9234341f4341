Vihiga MP Yusuf Chanzu has told Governor Moses Akaranga to stop inciting county staff against him.Chanzu, who is opposing Vihiga Governor Akaranga on the Amani National Congress (ANC) ticket in the August 8 election, asked the incumbent to tell the people of Vihiga what the county has achieved from the over Sh14 billion it received in the last four years on his watch.Chanzu accused Akaranga of lying to county staff that they would all be sacked if he won the governor&rsquo;s race.&ldquo;I have no problem with the workers in Vihiga county because they are entitled to employment, just like any other Kenyan. Akaranga is only panicking after realising he is losing the race,&rdquo; he said.The battle for the county chief seat pits Chanzu (ANC), Akaranga (Progressive Party of Kenya) and Emuhaya MP Wilbur Otichillo (Orange Democratic Movement).Speaking at Mbihi Primary School on Tuesday, Chanzu alleged that the money that was allocated for students&rsquo; bursaries in 25 wards was not accounted for.&ldquo;In the 2015-16 financial year, each ward was given Sh7 million for bursaries but only Sh5 million was disbursed, leaving a balance of Sh50 million. In the 2016-17 fiscal year, the same amount was allocated for bursaries, but only Sh3 million was disbursed, leaving Sh100 million. This money has not been accounted for,&rdquo; said Chanzu.Efforts to reach Akaranga for comment were futile as his cell phone was unanswered. The governor also did not respond to short text messages sent to him.
