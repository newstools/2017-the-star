Presidential debates owe their origin to the 1960 first ever broadcast presidential debate between the then Senator from Massachusetts John F Kennedy and incumbent Vice President Richard Nixon, who were trying to succeed Dwight Eisenhower as President.In Kenya, the first televised presidential debate took place in 2013, featuring ODM&rsquo;s Raila Odinga, TNA&rsquo;s Uhuru Kenyatta and several wannabes at the time, who many wondered why they were even included in the two debates at all.In the US and elsewhere, presidential debates give the leading contenders, usually two, the opportunity to show voters in a large audience, which includes TV, radio and social media all at once, what they&rsquo;re made of and a real-time comparison of their ability to grasp and address complex or tough questions without losing their cool.A presidential candidate who qualifies to be invited to debate, is supposed to show that he or she understands the issues facing the electorate and, more importantly, they have solutions they can articulate on their feet that are convincing to the voter for if they cannot do either, they&rsquo;re not worth being elected to office. There&rsquo;s also an unwritten rule for a candidate who qualifies to attend these debates, which is that it&rsquo;s a sign of respect for the voter and a willingness to want to earn their vote.Debates Media Limited, a consortium of media houses, announced last month that only Raila and President Uhuru qualified to be in the presidential debates this year, which was a good thing. However, only NASA leader Raila showed up on Monday, while Uhuru chose to stay away.By not showing up to debate Raila, Uhuru proved he was either not prepared for the big show or he just doesn&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s worth his time to answer questions related to his performance as President as a way of re-earning the votes of those who voted for him in 2013 and to add genuine votes beyond what he received. Either of this is contempt for voters of the highest order, for which Uhuru cannot expect but negative repercussions from evertone but his sycophants and those strictly voting on tribal grounds for him and his running mate.On the other hand, by showing up for the debate and answering tough questions, Raila not only articulated his vision for the country, yet again,but also made an eloquent case of why Uhuru and Jubilee should be sent packing. Most importantly, Raila once again demonstrated his statesmanship and appeal to voters, who long for leadership driven by vision and conviction and not convenience and pursuit of preservation of self. Uhuru now claims he snubbed the debate because he wants to engage Kenyans &ldquo;directly&rdquo; and not through the media.This is disingenuous at best; what Uhuru&rsquo;s snub represents is contempt for the voter other than his locked in supporters, who don&rsquo;t and won&rsquo;t amount to the majority of those going to the polls on August 8.For the rest, who are and will be the majority, they will most certainly interpret Uhuru&rsquo;s not showing up as an admission he cannot defend the abysmal record of his government, he can&rsquo;t explain the unprecedented mega-corruption of his government, he can&rsquo;t explain the colossal debt he has burdened all Kenyans with, including the unborn, much of which is already stolen. That he can&rsquo;t explain the record high unemployment, especially among the youth, and these are but a few hot issues Uhuru knew he couldn&rsquo;t handle and the real reason he opted not to turn up.Raila showed up and not only made his case why he still is the man to beat &mdash; and no one can beat him &mdash; but also showed his humility and readiness to lead despite all that he has endured, including years of detention and torture, and at least twice being rigged out of a presidency he clearly won. Any rational, objective person should and ought to say, &ldquo;Let the man have his turn this time round&rdquo;.Omwenga is a legal expert and political commentator in the United States
