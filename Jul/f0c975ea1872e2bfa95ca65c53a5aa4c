IEBC will not change the names of people in the voter register or those of candidates for the August 8 polls, chairperson Wafula Chebukati has said.NASA demanded a fresh audit of the voter register after SMS query flaws.They called for the use of the Integrated Population Registration Service to expunge dead voters from the final register.But Chebukati on Thursday said there is a time constraint as parties had followed the law in nominating their candidates.He also said parties resolved intra-party disputes at least 90 days prior to the election day and IEBC will not alter any of the names presented."The commission was required to register the candidates at least 60 days to the election day and a period of 10 days for disputes resolution but we are concerned about the pending cases in court ," he said.He warned against any malpractice during the election saying anyone found engaging in criminal activities will be prosecuted."The Voter identification we will use will help check voter turnout for purposes of results transmission and to stem any election fraud." Chebukati stated.He further stated that the Commission will stick to its deadlines towards the general elections.Chebukati said IEBC is following the set timelines despite numerous hurdles, especially emanating from procurement processes and the court orders."We are determined to recruit and train polling officials, print and distribute ballot papers, test technology, and proceed efficiently," he said.He also said the body had put in place an integrated electronic electoral system to govern the processes."The Commission has put in place this technology with an additional feature known as the candidate registration and management system (CRMS) which among other things has helped in interlinking the register of voters, voter identification system, candidate registration system and results transmission system." Chebukati said."While the CRMS is used to register candidates and produce ballot paper proofs, the voter identification will be used to authenticate voters."
