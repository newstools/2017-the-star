President Uhuru Kenyatta yesterday handed over seven ambulances to counties purchased with money recovered from a UK company found guilty of bribery to get a Kenyan contract.The ambulances will be used to support the health referral system and will be based at health centres that really need them.The counties which have benefitted are Laikipia, Wajir, West Pokot, Kitui, Elgeyo Marakwet and Nairobi. Governors Joshua Irungu (Laikipia), Ahmed Abdullahi (Wajir), Simon Kachapin (West Pokot), Julius Malombe (Kitui), Evans Kidero (Nairobi) and Senator Kipchumba Murkomen (Elgeyo Marakwet) received the ambulances on behalf of their counties.The seven counties have a unique referral system challenges, largely related to remoteness, as well as existence of a huge network of primary care facilities in relation to the number of hospitals available to the people.The ambulances have been fitted with Basic Life Support equipment to ensure safe transport of patients.Speaking during the function, Uhuru said his government is working closely with the government of the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Jersey on a tripartite agreement-framework for the return of assets from corruption and crime in Kenya.The President said the repatriation of proceeds of corruption arising from the Smith &amp; Ouzman case is a significant step taken by the government.&ldquo;These ambulances will go a long way in saving lives and enhancing emergency response services in the selected counties, which were in dire need of this support,&rdquo; he said.
