Kakamega Health executive Penina Mukabane has denied household registration for mass distribution of mosquito nets is a Jubilee poll rigging plan. She said the ongling listing has nothing to do with the election on August 8. Mukabane spoke to beneficiaries of the county’s maternal cash transfer programme on Wednesday. “Some people fear being listed as they think the exercise is a plan by Jubilee to remove their names from the voters’ register. But this is a national government programme to establish the number of people in households for purposes of distributing the treated nets,” she said. The government intends to distribute 15.1 million mosquito nets to residents in 23 counties. Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya’s wife, Priscilla, was the chief guest. The programme called OparanyaCare has enlisted 44,500 women in the county. But only 33,000 are benefitting. Under the programme, expectant mothers are listed and followed up to ensure they attend antenatal clinics. They receive Sh12,000 from delivery until the child is 18 months old. The money is in tranches of Sh2,000. Mukabane said programme members who have arrears due to financial problems, will be paid their dues starting in September. The programme receives Sh90 million every financial year from the county. Mukabane said the county government has passed the Kakamega County Maternal and Child Health Act to ensure its continuity after Oparanya’s tenure.
