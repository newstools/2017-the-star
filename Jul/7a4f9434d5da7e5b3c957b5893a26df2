Two plastic bags importers moved to court yesterday to challenge the legal notice that banned the use, manufacture and importation of the bags for commercial and household packaging. Businessmen Fredrick Njenga and Stephen Mwangi say the legal notice No. 2356 of 2017 did not comply with the Statutory Instruments Act 2013. CS Judi Wakhungu issued the directive on February 27. Njenga and Mwangi want the court to stop the Environment ministry from implementing the notice and issuing subsequent notices without legal justification. They argue that the six-month timeline for compliance is limited and they require ample time to clear all stocks and fulfill their contractual obligations. “The subject notice is unconstitutional because it is not in keeping with the principles of good governance enshrined in the Constitution — accountability, public participation and transparency,” their petition reads. Njenga and Mwangi say there was no stakeholders’ input before the decision was made. The two claim they, together with their employees, stand to suffer great economic losses should the ban be enforced. They say the notice lacks clarity, making it difficult to understand content. Njenga and Mwangi say the plastic bag industry employs millions of people, adding that they have multimillion-shilling stock. They say this will go to waste should the notice be effected on August 28. The bags banned include carrier bags constructed with handles and those with or without gussets, or flat bags without handles and with or without gussets. Even retail outlets will not be allowed to use polythene bags to package or pack goods for customers. The government has made similar efforts but all failed as no ban was enforced.
