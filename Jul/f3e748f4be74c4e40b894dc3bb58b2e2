Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka has lashed out at President Uhuru Kenyatta for saying he has nothing to offer Ukambani residents.Uhuru and DP William Ruto said on Saturday that the NASA Deputy President candidate's future in the Opposition is uncertain."I urge my brother Kalonzo not to be misled by Raila Odinga (flag bearer). Come and work with us. When I leave office, you can work with William and move this country forward,&rdquo; Uhuru said.[VIDEO] Choose Jubilee's clear path or NASA's tribalism on August 8, Uhuru tells KenyansBut Kalonzo, who is Wiper leader, said he cannot join the "sinking Jubilee ship" whose leaders will not win the election on August 8."It is comical for Uhuru and Ruto to ask me to join them as they march towards Opposition trenches, for that is surely where they will be after NASA takes over power," he said.In a statement on Sunday, Kalonzo further said the utterances by the two in Kitui reflected frustration, agony and bitterness in Jubilee Party."...their repeated foray into the Lower Eastern region have failed to bear any tangible results."The Wiper chief also said claims that he has nothing for his people were "not only false but also laughable"."The fact that I was re-elected four times as Mwingi North MP is evidence of the confidence the electorate had in my leadership abilities," he said.He added that any under-development in any part of Kenya should be blamed on past presidents Jomo Kenyatta, Daniel Moi and Mwai Kibaki, as well as Uhuru."Such utterances reflect the state of panic and utter desperation on the part of the President and DP," Kalonzo said."They are trying, too late, to curry favours with a completely disgusted electorate who have already made up their minds to reject the extremely inept, blatantly corrupt and shamelessly tribal Jubilee regime on August 8."Uhuru led the Jubilee brigade to Lower Eastern to drum support for his re-election. Ruto said he is sure Kalonzo will not lead his people to a "fake Canaan".&ldquo;My brother Kalonzo is a Christian who I am sure will not allow his people to be led to a fake Canaan where chang'aa and busaa are legalised. The Canaan we know in the Bible is the one that has honey and milk,&rdquo; he said.Read: Canaan and chang'aa do not mix, Ruto tells RailaRaila has described himself as Kenya's Joshua and the leader who will lead the people to the promised land.More on this: NASA's Joshua: Raila prays at Israel's Wailing Wall ahead of electionAlso read: Walk with me to Canaan, Raila urges Tharaka
