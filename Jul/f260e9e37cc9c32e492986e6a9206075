NASA co-principal Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula has accused Bungoma ODM governor candidate Alfred Khang&rsquo;ati of being a Jubilee project and mole.The alliance has fielded three candidates in the governor race to unseat the incumbent Kenneth Lusaka, a Jubilee pointman in the Western region.They include Khang&rsquo;ati of ODM, Stephen Mutoro (ANC) and Wycliffe Wangamati of Ford Kenya, who have been traversing the county&rsquo;s nine constituencies to hunt for votes ahead of the polls next month.Speaking on Monday in the H-young area in Kanduyi constituency during a Ford Kenya meeting, Wetang&rsquo;ula said they have enough evidence the former Kanduyi MP is being used by Jubilee to split NASA votes.Wetang&rsquo;ula said they will not allow Khang&rsquo;ati to ravage NASA in Bungoma and give Lusaka another victory as they watch.&ldquo;We want to change the leadership of the Bungoma county government that has denied the electorate meaningful change, yet we are hearing Khang&rsquo;ati on radio and other local media houses urging the electorate to vote for Lusaka,&rdquo; he said.But Bungoma ODM chairman Ali Balala dismissed Wetang&rsquo;ula&rsquo;s claims, saying the senator has panicked because the Ford Kenya candidate is weak and will not win, hence resorting to propaganda.Balala, the Maraka ward MCA said Khangati is best suited to be the next governor.&ldquo;We do not want a governor who will serve Weta, Raila or Mudavadi, but a people&rsquo;s governor, who will transform our county,&rdquo; he said.
