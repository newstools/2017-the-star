MEMBERS of the Presidential Strategic Communications Unit have really mellowed. Some PR officials in government were heard whispering that since the suspension of some four directors in June last year, the team has decided “to earn their salary in peace”. Initially, the directors, despite being civil servants, would send out strongly worded statements hitting at Opposition chief Raila Odinga. But that was until the axe landed on them, with days of suspension. It’s whispered that the statements are now sent out only with the approval of politicians like Majority Leader Aden Duale. The government officials joked that the furthest the PSCU Directors can now go in making a public statement and hitting at Raila is to post on Facebook and Twitter. ******** DP William Ruto may have a point when he says siasa ni kujipanga (politics is all about strategy). An MP from Nyanza, who won the ODM ticket, could have learnt a thing from the DP. The man is already jostling to be the Majority leader. The first-time MP believes that the current Deputy Minority leader Jakoyo Midiwo, who is among the region’s senior-most MPs, will not be in the 12th Parliament. Midiwo was beaten in the ODM nominations by little-known Elisha Odhiambo. Minority Leader Francis Nyenze, on the other hand, has fallen out with many within NASA, after his alleged endorsement of President Uhuru Kenyatta. The “vacuum” has seen the emergence of young turks who are jostling to catch the eyes of their party bosses. ******** AN outspoken Jubilee nominated lawmaker who has for the last four-and-a-half years been criticizing politicians who rely heavily on their tribes to survive politically, especially in cosmopolitan areas, seems to have proved herself wrong. The candidate, vying for a hotly contested seat in the city where candidates are mostly wooing and banking on voters from their tribes, is said to have joined the tribal mobilization game, begging her people, the majority in the constituency, not to deny her votes for not being in NASA. ******** AN academic registrar of a university in Kampala, Uganda, is a man under siege. Some Kenyan students who graduated from the same university are up in arms threatening to sue the institution and its current registrar for dishing out “fake” degrees to prominent people who are vying for elective posts in Kenya. ******** CHOICES, as one Johnnie Carson once remarked, have consequences. Take, for instance, this ODM governor who is whispered to have frequented clubs and dance floors to the chagrin of the electorate. Well, this behaviour has returned to haunt the county boss. His opponents claim he has been dancing for the last five years.
