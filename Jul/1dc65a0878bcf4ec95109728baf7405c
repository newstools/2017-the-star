Siaya Senator James Orengo has faulted directive by acting Interior CS Fred Matiang'i against adopting polling stations to safeguard Raila Odinga&rsquo;s votes.Orengo on Saturday told journalists the plan still stands and will not be derailed by the directive.He said nothing bars NASA supporters from protecting their votes just like in the foreign nations.&ldquo;We want to tell the CS that he should stop issuing directives which he cannot back constitutionally. Police should also desist from being used to harass and intimidate citizens,&rdquo; he said.The Senator said opposition will deploy monitors at each polling station to safeguard its presidential votes, in addition to official party agents.But Matiang'i said only presiding officers, deputies, polling clerks and accredited party agents will be at polling stations on August polls.He directed police not allow any chaos at polling stations and should act firmly on unaccredited persons. He said that the protection of ballot is the responsibility of IEBC and police.However, Orengo said it is the duty of the IEBC to address Kenyans on the election matters and not the executive arm of government to tell citizens how the process should be conducted.He said they will not relent in protecting Raila&rsquo;s votes, adding that such directive is one of the wider schemes by Jubilee to rig the elections.The directive comes as NASA volunteers have already adopted 35,679 of the more than 40,000 polling stations, which they argued are done peacefully.He further warned the government against plots to use police and army officers to scare voters in the opposition strongholds.&ldquo;We are aware of the scheme to militarise the country majorly in Nasa zones to deny them opportunity to exercise their democratic rights,&rdquo; Orengo said.He expressed confidence that the opposition will win the election with a landslide in the first round if voters are not harassed and intimidated being schemed.Orengo named Marsabit, Samburu and Turkana among other counties where NASA has gained more support- with plans being hatched to scuttle voting.The senator said NASA will update the presidential vote results from its tallying centre within eight hours after closure of polling stations.&ldquo;We will scan results at every polling station and transmit to the centre. We must guard our votes at all cost,&rdquo; he added.In 2007, Orengo said the rigging was open unlike in 2013 where it was sophisticated but a bit primitive.He challenged IEBC to put measures in place to be able to swiftly detect if their data system has been tampered with.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
