The Kenya Union of the Blind has said it will take legal action against political parties for discriminating against the visually impaired in the list of preferred candidates for nomination to the 12th Parliament.This comes after Jubilee Party failed to include the blind in its invite to those wishing to be included in the nomination list. In the advert, the party invited applications for the disabled from people with physical disability, mental disability and hearing impairment.Through its chairperson, Chomba Munyi, the union says Jubilee had practiced outright discrimination against the visually impaired and added they will seek legal redress should the party fail to reconsider its list.&ldquo;The interest of the blind can only be represented by those who are visually impaired &mdash; not physically or mentally impaired. We urged political parties to reconsider their stand, failing which we will not hesitate to seek legal redress,&rdquo; Chomba said. &ldquo;Our plea to have JP reconsider its stand was futile as it landed on deaf ears. There&rsquo;s been no response,&rdquo; Chomba said, adding they should not be neglected at the county and national levels.
