Jubilee leaders and businesspeople yesterday raised Sh228 million for Wajir governor candidate Mohamed Abdi Mohamud in less than three hours.The invite-only fundraiser was held at a Nairobi hotel.It was attended by Aden Keynan (Eldas), Wajir East&rsquo;s Abass Sheikh Mohamed, Wajir North&rsquo;s Ibrahim Saney and Tarbaj&rsquo;s Mohamed Elmi Fai. Mohamud has been endorsed by the larger Degodia, Ajuran and Ogaden communities of Wajir South and Wajir North. Leaders who in 2013 supported Wajir Governor Ahmed Abdullahi have broken ranks with him, saying he has failed to live up to the expectations of the people of Wajir.They accused Abdullahi of falling to build a cohesive and integrated society by engaging in selective and discriminatory development. Abdi, a former teacher fondly referred to as Mwalimu Pekee, thanked all those who turned up for the funds drive, saying he was humbled by the gesture. The money is meant for him and those in his line-up.
