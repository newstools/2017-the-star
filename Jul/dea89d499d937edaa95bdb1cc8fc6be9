The Lamu register still contains some dead voters, Rishad Amana, a politician, has said. Speaking on the phone yesterday, Amana told the Star since Friday, his team has discovered at least four dead voters in the list. Some people who sought transfer to other polling stations have had their details reversed, he says. “One of my staff was initially registered to vote in Kisumu but transferred his voting station to Lamu where he is working. On Saturday, he discovered he has been moved back to Kisumu,” Amana said. He said a private audit should be carried out to determine if those who have died since 2013 are still in the register. “We have found there are people who died in 2013 and 2014 whose names are still in the register,” Amana said. He threated to sue the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission after the three-day audit is over. On Wednesday, the IEBC announced it had expunged 88,602 dead voters from the register, bringing the the number of registered voters to 19,611,423. However, chairman Wafula Chebukati said the IEBC is alive to the fact that it is not possible to remove all dead voters from the register. Kenyans on Thursday expressed frustration after the SMS voter verification number provided by the IEBC revealed errors. But Chebukati dismissed claims that the audited register of voters has wrong entries.
