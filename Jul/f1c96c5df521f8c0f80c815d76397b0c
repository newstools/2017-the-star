An Elgeyo Marakwet clan on Monday claimed they have been displaced by land-grabbers from Kerio Valley following reports oil was found in the region.British firm Tullow Oil announced it discovered &lsquo;good oil&rsquo; in Cheptuket 1 in March last year.Members of the Kapkomool clan, Keiyo South, claimed 5,000 acres have been grabbed by land speculators.Led by John Chebii, they said the land-grabbers are now illegally adjudicating the communal land. He spoke after submitting a petition to Elgeyo Marakwet county commissioner Fredrick Ndambuki on Monday. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want strangers to take away our land after they heard there is oil,&rdquo; Chebii said.He alleged the clan had moved to Uasin Gishu in the 1950s and urged the state to halt the issuance of title deeds to the land-grabbers.&ldquo;We have fought to have our land back since 1985, but no one has listened to us. The grabbers are now subdividing the land,&rdquo; Chebii said.He said the land-grabbers have degraded their land by cutting down trees for charcoal.Clan chairman Daniel Lonchoni said adjudication of the land should be suspended until the dispute is resolved.Lonchoni accused land officials in the county of failing to stop the adjudication.Keiyo North assistant deputy county commissioner Sylvester Munyasia assured clan members that no title deeds will be issued until the dispute is resolved.
