Peter Kenneth has said he will not shelve his bid for governor in favour of Jubilee candidate Mike Sonko.He yesterday told President Uhuru Kenyatta to let voters elect the person of their choice. Kenneth spoke as he campaigned in Hardy, Karen.Last Friday, Uhuru urged Kenneth to consider stepping down for Sonko and promised to give him a job if reelected.But Kenneth, who lost during the JP primaries in April, has said he will not back down. &ldquo;I know as a party leader, he must walk around with his candidate. We cannot say he was wrong to walk around with his candidate. [But] my request, my very humble request to the President, ni awachilie watu wa Nai waajiamulie wenyewe (he should let Nairobians elect a governor of their choice),&rdquo; he said.Kenneth hit out at Sonko and incumbent Governor Evans Kidero, saying the two have failed to address the problems residents face.He said, &ldquo;Kidero is a consistent failure who cannot account for the billions of shillings he has received from the national government and collected from residents for the last four years.&rdquo;Kenneth continued, &ldquo;One thing I agree with the President is that he agrees Kidero is a failure. And if Kidero fails, the person who oversights him is the senator. Where was he when Kidero was failing? They have failed together.&rdquo;He said Sonko cannot be the solution to the problems affecting Nairobians when &ldquo;he [Sonko] himself is a problem&rdquo;.&ldquo;So there is nothing new. Kidero is a consistent failure and Sonko is unmitigated disaster,&rdquo; Kenneth said. He claimed hat Sonko, who launched his manifesto on Sunday, cannot tackle the problems facing residents because &ldquo;he doesn&rsquo;t even know the contents of his own manifesto.&rdquo; Political pundits say Jubilee views Kenneth as a person out to divide votes and deny Sonko victory.
