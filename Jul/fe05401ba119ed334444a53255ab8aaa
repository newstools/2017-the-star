The Lang&rsquo;ata MP seat is among the hotly-contested race in Nairobi.Seventeen names will be on the ballot on August 8.Five are from NASA affiliate parties - ODM, ANC, Ford Kenya, CCM and Wiper. Eight others will run as independents.Though a tight race is expected between ODM&rsquo;s Oscar Omoke and Jubilee&rsquo;s Nixon Korir, known as Generali, the torrent of other candidates will split the vote and make it a wide-open race.The NASA affiliate candidates are Senator Judith Sijeny (Wiper), Kiprotich Tunoi (Chama Cha Mashinani), Daniel Odera (Ford Kenya) and William Kipkemboi (ANC).Others areAbdullahi Shariff (Kanu), Margery Kiragu (LPK) and Stephen Kipruto (CCU).Independent candidates are Musaari Kahiga, Daniel Akweli, Kavore Kariuki, Robert Kipkemboi, Douglas Kithyaka, Hillary Okumu, Amos Otula and John Thuo.Lang&rsquo;ata has 132,572 registered voters. The constituency has five wards. They are Karen, Nairobi West, Mugumoini, South C and Nyayo Highrise.Mugumoini has the highest number of voters at 27,142, followed by Karen&rsquo;s 25,187. South C has 18,198 voters, Nyayo Highrise has 15,402 and Nairobi West has 10,769. The constituency has been a perceived opposition zone.NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga served as the MP of then larger Lang&rsquo;ata constituency for 20 years, from 1992 to 2012.It was split into Kibra and Lang&rsquo;ata in 2013, following the promulgation of the 2010 Constitution.Political analysts say although ODM is still considered the strongest party in the area, rivalry among NASA candidates and changing political dynamics, especially in the last five years, might give Jubilee an advantage.In the 2013 election, Joash Olum (ODM) beat Korir, then running on the URP ticket, by 7, 654 votes .It was argued that were it not for TNA candidate John Thuo, who won 11, 932 votes, Korir would have carried the day.&ldquo;Jubilee lost in 2013, because we had two candidates, from TNA and URP. But this time we are sure because Kikuyus, Kalenjins and other communities in that area will vote for one candidate,&rdquo; Jubilee Nairobi chairman Sanctus Ndegwa said.Jubilee appears to have learned from the mistakes that cost it the seat in 2013 and has fielded only one candidate, Korir.Korir has intensified campaigns and will also be riding on the coattails of President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto.Omoke is expected to rely on ODM and Raila&rsquo;s popularity to vanquish his rivals.
