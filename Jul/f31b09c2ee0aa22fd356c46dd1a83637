The Muslim community in Kisii and Nyamira counties yesterday told NASA presidential flagbearer Raila Odinga to stop interfering with acting Interior CS Fred Matiang’i’s work. Supkem chairman Juma Musa said Matiang’i should be respected because he was legally given the mandate to act by President Uhuru Kenyatta. He said the country’s security is paramount and Matiang’i should be given space to discharge his duties. “I am urging the NASA presidential flagbearer to stop interfering with the Acting Interior CS’s work,” Musa told the press in Kisii. He said rubbished claims Matiang’i is colluding with IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati to rig the election. Raila has said security forces will be deployed in opposition strongholds to intimidate voters. “I don’t see how the acting Interior CS could be working in cahoots with the IEBC chairman to mess up the polls. His main role is to provide security to Kenyans,” Juma said. He called for peaceful campaigns and said those planning to cause chaos will be cursed. “I urge aspirants to stop making inciting statements,” Musa said. Meanwhile, Kisii police commander Haret Abdi has warned youths against being used by politicians to cause mayhem. He said the police will not tolerate politicians who exploit youth. Musa said the police have put in place measures to protect lives and property. “Those using youths to cause chaos should be warned security agents are prepared and will not hesitate to protect the lives and property of residents,” he said. Last Sunday, Matiang’i told Raila he cannot be intimated while performing his duties. He said he has the constitutional right to work with all sectors, including the IEBC, to ensure security during the August 8 polls. “Our work is to protect Kenyans and support the IEBC. I will not entertain threats when it comes to safeguarding Kenyans’ interests,” Matiang’i said.
