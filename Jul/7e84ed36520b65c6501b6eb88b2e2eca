Water CS Eugene Wamalwa has told parties to let the IEBC do its work without interference. Speaking during the launch of the cash transfer programme in Busia town on Wednesday, he said a lot of money has been allocated to the IEBC, Judiciary and police to enable them to do their work effectively without political intervention. The cash transfer programme targets people aged 70 and above. Budalang’i MP and Labour Party of Kenya leader Ababu Namwamba, who had accompanied Wamalwa, said he will work with the CS and do everything he can to ensure President Uhuru Kenyatta gets many votes in Western. The region is seen as an opposition stronghold. Last week, Namwamba and Wamalwa said Jubilee will bring change to Western. “This election is not just about Raila Odinga and Uhuru Kenyatta or NASA and Jubilee, but the future of the Luhya nation,” Wamalwa said. He accused NASA flagbearer Raila Odinga of misusing leaders from the community for personal gain. Namwamba said it is time for real transformation for the people and the region. “Where Eugene and I are is where the future of this region is. That other option being dangled represents unfulfilled promises, journeys that can never be, being used and even being sold,” Namwamba said. He said NASA supporters should continue walking the “dead journey and leave those supporting and working with the government to walk the journey of hope”.
