President Uhuru Kenyatta and NASA flagbearer Raila Odinga have pulled out of Monday&rsquo;s planned debate.All the debates are scheduled to be held at Catholic University of Eastern Africa at 7.30pm and aired by all participating media houses on television and radio stations.Each debate will run uninterrupted for 90 minutes. Uhuru will not participate in the debate to avoid being drawn into a shouting match, Jubilee Party vice chairman David Murathe said.Murathe also cited the lack of consultation by organisers, saying the President was &ldquo;not aware of the rules of engagement&rdquo;.&ldquo;How can we go into a debate not knowing what the format is? So let them do it without him,&rdquo; Murathe said on the phone.The organisers were to announce the thematic areas of the debate on Monday but had not done so by yesterday, another reason cited by the Jubilee team. Sources within the presidency said debating Raila alone would be of no benefit to Uhuru.&ldquo;If he debates all the candidates, the President will only popularise their bids, which is not in his best interests. There is no clear benefit of the debate,&rdquo; a senior official said.Raila&rsquo;s aide Dennis Onyango said the opposition chief had no plans to skip the debate even with Uhuru failing to show up.But his senior advisor Salim Lone later issued a statement saying Raila would not take part in the debate after all.Lone said the NASA Presidential Campaign Secretariat has urged Uhuru to be open to debating Raila on the issues affecting Kenyans in the present circumstances.This came as the organisers defended themselves in court for announcing that the main debate would be between Uhuru and Raila with the other candidates having their own.The organisers had said that those to be invited must command at least five per cent popular support in opinion polls which led one of the presidential candidates to court.Alliance for Real Change&rsquo;s Abduba Dida, who has been coming third in the latest polls, sued the organisers, saying this amounted to discrimination.The first debate for this election is slated for July 10 while running mates would argue their bids on July 17. The final presidential debate would be held on July 24. Eight presidential candidates, including Uhuru, Dida and Raila, cleared by the IEBC were expected to face off.
