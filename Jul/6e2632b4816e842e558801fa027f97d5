Changamwe MP aspirant Peterson Mitau has criticised incumbent legislator Omar Mwinyi, saying he has no development record to show for the time he has been in office.He said Mwinyi has sensed defeat and has decided to spread smear campaigns against him.Mitau has been carrying out rallies and road shows every week, since he was cleared to run as an independent by the IEBC.He was initially in Wiper, but bolted out after he was allegedly rigged out by Wiper secretary general Hassan Omar. Omar has distanced himself from the accusation. Mitau claimed Daniel Muange was awarded the Wiper ticket, despite taking number three during the party primaries.On Saturday in Bomu, Changamwe, Mitau said Mwinyi has been spreading rumours that he is being financed by President Uhuru Kenyatta to unseat him. Mwinyi is in ODM.But Mwinyi said, &ldquo;Mitau can say anything he wants. Let him say whatever he feels good about, but we are not in the same league. We will never be in the same league.&rdquo;He spoke to the Star on the phone yesterday.
