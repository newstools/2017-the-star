A physics and mathematics teacher has proved that integration of ICT teaching can be done after he developed innovative ways of using computers to teach students.Paul Thairu, 36, a teacher at Loreto Kiambu Girls High School, emerged the teacher of the year in 2017 in ICT integration in teaching and learning.The Centre for Mathematics, Science and Technology awarded him during the Kenya Secondary Schools Heads Association 42nd annual conference in Mombasa that was held in June.The first time award achievement saw Thairu beat other teachers who had applied and underwent vigorous and thorough scrutiny from their schools and proceeded to the regional contest. He won and proceeded to the inter-county competition and was selected number one in the whole of the country."The journey to me winning was not that easy as the competition started right in schools where invigilators would come and see what I am doing and my efforts saw me through to the finals. I beat many other skilled teachers for position one," Thairu said.He told the Star on Tuesday that he started teaching his students 10 years ago by using locally available materials so they could understand, rather than using the old fashioned way that is teacher-centred.Later, he also let the students do the practicals and discuss among themselves.Thairu introduced the use of audio visuals where the students would do practicals and he would record them on his phone and use it to teach other students using a computer and projector."I came to find out that once a students sees their colleagues in a audio visual practical they related well with what I was teaching and were encouraged and could discuss among themselves. This improved their grades tremendously," he said.School principal Lydia Kariuki said the introduction of ICT has made students look forward to learning and is more effective.Elizabeth Munee and Ivy Nyambura, both form four students, said the use of computers and other ICT equipment has helped them understand better and they do not strain in reading due to the help of audio visuals."We always look forward to the classes and what we learn and we can easily access information through the internet during school holidays, which will help us in our exams to perform better," Munee said.
