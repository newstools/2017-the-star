NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga has committed to defend press freedom if NASA forms the next government.Raila yesterday told media owners and senior editors that he will continue in his push to champion the rights of the media as he had done in the past. He held a breakfast meeting in Nairobi.&ldquo;The Jubilee government has been making every effort to muzzle the media and this is unacceptable. We believe that the media should be allowed to operate in a free eviroment,&rdquo; said Raila, who was accompanied byMusalia Mudavadi, the chairman of his campaign team.The two-hour meeting was aimed at sharing concerns by the two sides on the ongoing election campaigns. The editors on their part expressed commitment and determination to cover the election in a transparent and impartial manner. CEO Sam Shollei of Standard Group, Wachira Waruru of Royal Media Services, Patrick Quarcoo (Radio Africa), and Joe Muganda of Nation Media Group told Raila that all the media wanted was a free, fair, credible and peaceful election.&ldquo;We are all trying our best to give all candidates fair coverage and we would like to hear your position on the outcome of the election. Will you concede defeat if you lost election?&rdquo; Waruru said. Raila assured that he will concede defeat in the unlikely event he loses.&ldquo;I have been saying this, that in the unlikely event I will lose in a free and fair election I will accept defeat,&rdquo; Raila said.The government has in the past been accused of attempting to stifle press freedom through legislation intended to shrink the media space enjoyed in the country. The infamous Kenya Information and Communications (Amendment) Act, 2013, is among the legislation that journalists have protested against, saying they are unfriendly to their work environment.KICA Bill created a government-controlled body with powers to punish journalists and media houses for what they report. The Media Council Bill 2013 was another contentious bill that proposed to give the government power to have undue influence in the running of the council.
