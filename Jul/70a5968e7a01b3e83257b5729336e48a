The Ministry of Water yesterday distanced itself from a planned sale of Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company.Water Principal Secretary Fred Sigor said the planned privatisation of the company that supplies water to city residents was not initiated by the ministry.However, appearing before the County Assembly Water and Sanitation Committee on Wednesday, NCWSC managing director Philip Gichuki claimed Maji House was behind the planned privatisation of the state corporation.Gichuki said a draft memorandum of understanding was presented to him in Casablanca, Morocco while on a bench-marking trip but he declined to sign it without advice from their legal office.The trip, he said, was planned at the ministry in February during the launch of a project to drill 40 boreholes to ease the water crisis in the city.&ldquo;After the meeting, we were told to remain behind. Officials of a company called SUEZ made a presentation to us about their work,&rdquo; Gichuki said.Water Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa, Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero and Water CEC Peter Kimori attended the presentation.But Sigor said the ministry could not plan the sale of the company since it was not under its management.&ldquo;NCWSC is under Nairobi county government. The county owns and runs it. I don&rsquo;t know the SUEZ company they are referring to,&rdquo; he said on the phone.The PS also denied a separate meeting was called after the launch of the boreholes project. Workers of the NCWSC have boycotted work for the last three weeks, over fears there are plans to privatise the state corporation.NCWSC technical director Nahashon Muguna was part of the team that visited Casablanca but said he realised SUEZ had nothing new to offer.
