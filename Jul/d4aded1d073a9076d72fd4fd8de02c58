Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana (pictured) has warned NASA MP candidates against infighting, saying this plays to the advantage of JP-allied contestants. Kibwana yesterday said JP candidates in Kibwezi East and Makueni pose a big threat to Wiper&rsquo;s Jessica Mbalu (Kibwezi East) and Daniel Maanzo (Makueni) because the two are embroiled in intense rivalry with candidates of NASA affiliates. Kibwana wants them to stop their &ldquo;friendly fire&rdquo;, agree and forge a united front. Mbalu, however, wants &ldquo;unpopular&rdquo; NASA candidates to step down. She is battling it out with former Vision 2030 director Nicholas Mwilu of Muungano Party and former KMTC chairman Philip Kaloki (JP).Mbalu has urged Kibwana to talk Mwilu into quitting the race. Mwilu is believed to have entered the fray with the county chief&rsquo;s blessings. Mbalu said his continued presence in the race only benefits Kaloki. But Mwilu disagrees and insists he will be in the race to the end, saying JP is not a threat in the region. Maanzo faces Tom Luusa (ODM), Suzzane Kiamba (Muungano Party) and Peter Kiilu (JP). On Tuesday, he said he spends a lot of time on his bid, instead of drumming up support for NASA candidate Raila Odinga and running mate Kalonzo Musyoka because of intense competition from other NASA candidates. A similar case is playing out in Mbooni, where JP&rsquo;s Kisoi Munyao is said to be taking advantage of the rivalry between Wiper&rsquo;s Mary Muting&rsquo;a and Muungano&rsquo;s Benson Kithuku.
