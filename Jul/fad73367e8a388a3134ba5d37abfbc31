Deputy President William Ruto yesterday took Jubilee campaigns to Tana River and Kilifi counties.He said opposition leaders were "captive to cartels who were funding their party". Ruto said reports that NASA is being rocked by confusion because of two different manifestos, is a clear indication the leaders focus is to pursue wealth through business deals at the expense of Kenyans. He addressed rallies in Bura, Magarini, Kaloleni, Ganze and Chonyi.Ruto said one of the manifestos is meant to take care of the interests of the corruption cartels funding NASA campaigns.He said the other manifesto, which was recently launched, is just a cover-up of the reality.&ldquo;It is now clear that one of the manifestos explains how the corruption cartels will get kickbacks inform of tenders to be awarded to dubious projects like the Anglo Leasing if NASA forms the next government,&rdquo; Ruto said. He challenged NASA leaders to come clean on the manifesto debacle and who were behind them. Ruto cautioned voters against electing power-hungry individuals, who are only worried about their own selfish interests.Governor Hussein Dado (Tana River), MPs Ali Wario (Bura), Halima Ware (woman rep), Hussein Dukicha (Galole), Harrison Kombe (Magarini), Gideon Mung'aro (Kilifi North) and former Garsen MP Danson Mungatana were present. Dado hit out at NASA leaders for failing to give an alternative agenda for the country and instead criticising Jubilee projects. He said opposition leaders have been undermining the work of the IEBC, including demanding the cancellation of the printing of ballot papers tender, saying they are not ready for next month's polls.&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not beat about the bush. NASA leaders want the August 8 election to be postponed, because they are not ready. They are now applying delaying tactics and that&rsquo;s why they want the printing of ballot papers stopped,&rdquo; Dado said.Mung'aro said after four years of devolution, Kilifi county remained underdeveloped despite huge amounts of money, saying Governor Amason Kingi has failed to revive tourism to employ the youth.
