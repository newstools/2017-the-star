You are a man of good history because we have seen you work for the people of Nairobi without discrimination against tribe or even class,&rdquo; Kilonzo said.He dismissed a group of Kamba leaders who recently endorsed Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero for the same seat during a rally held at the Nyayo Stadium.Kilonzo said the group led by Machakos Senator Johnson Muthama, which brought together some Kambas living in Nairobi, does not represent the community&rsquo;s position.&ldquo;My council is the only body that has the responsibility and mandate to crown anyone as an elder of this community. So I don&rsquo;t know which community those who went to crown Kidero were representing,&rdquo; he said.Kilonzo asked sonko to ensure he serves all once elected Nairobi governor.&ldquo;This is a great day for all of us and I want to thank you very much and assure you that I will never forget my roots. I know that even as we hold this function here my father is watching us from his grave,&rdquo; said Sonko, who broke into tears. Igathe asked all Kambas in Nairobi to rally behind Sonko.The ceremony was attended by church leaders, members of the Nairobi Kamba Forum and Mua residents.
