The Maasai community have been forced to go back to the drawing board in the search for the Maa kingpin, following the death of Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery last Saturday. He was the frontrunner to succeed former Heritage minister William ole Ntimama, who died on September 1 last year. Nkaissery was mentioned alongside Nairobi speaker Alex ole Magelo, Kajiado Governor David Nkedianye, MPs Patrick Ntutu (Narok West), Katoo ole Metito (Kajiado South), Kanchory Memusi (Kajiado Central), Shadrack Rotiken and other leaders for the position of the community spokesman. Metito is the interim spokesman, some elders said. In October last year, a group of Maasai professionals fronted Nkaissery for spokesman. But early this year, some leaders rejected calls to have the CS as the spokesman, saying he has failed to unite Maasais and has been the source of trouble in the community. Instead, they endorsed Magelo for the position, saying he has been fighting for the community’s rights. The leaders said Magelo has been one of the community’s pillars and whenever they are faced with problems in Narok and Kajiado, he is with them. The Maasai elders said they will soon meet all the leaders from Narok, Kajiado, Samburu, Laikipia, Rendile and Mt Elgon to discuss who they will name spokesman. Orkilai Orok Council of Elders secretary general Samson Rotiken said they are already making a legal framework on how the community leader will be elected. “Normally, the community spokesman is not elected and not paid, but his actions, development track record and credibility and also being an indigenous person make him qualify for the post,” he said. Rotiken spoke to journalists in Narok town yesterday. He was and chairman Kasaine ole Esho said elders endorsed Metito as interim community spokesman as he has been approved by the community.
