Raphael Tuju has asked "over-excited" Luos to prepare for any eventuality in the presidential election.The Jubilee secretary general said the people should accept defeat should that be the case in the race pitting President Uhuru Kenyatta against NASA's Raila Odinga.They should carry on with the normal lives, he said, adding: &ldquo;You should be prepared to absorb the shock that comes with Uhuru defeating your son."He addressed on Saturday accompanied by Jubilee's Nyanza and Western presidential campaign coordinators Steve Mwanga and Hudson Aluvanje.This was at Arram village in Rarieda during the burial of David Odongo, the brother of former Kenya Pipeline MD George Okungu.Tuju said his analysis shows Jubilee enjoys unwavering support across the country while Raila is "busy fantasising" about his Luoland strongholds.&ldquo;He is like a fish swimming in a pond, not knowing there is an ocean as well,&rdquo; he said.An Infotrak poll found that if elections had been held on June 30, Uhuru would win by 48 per cent against Raila's 43 per cent.It also found Jubilee the most popular party at 47 per cent support compared to NASA's 43 per cent.Read more: Uhuru would get 48% votes, Raila 43% if polls held today - InfotrakAlso read: 2017 numbers favour Uhuru if vote patterns remain the sameThe former cabinet minister further asked the Luo community not to burn bridges with Jubilee saying they might find solace in it in future.Tuju further said Luos should not be myopic when interpreting politics as this has dragged them into oblivion while others enjoy their shares of the national cake."It is fine if Raila wins the presidency but what about if Uhuru defeats him? What will you people do?" he asked.The SG termed himself the true living testimony of a Luo leader who has benefited from successive regimes because of his progressive politics that is devoid of fighting governments.He cited the lucrative job of presidential adviser to retired president Mwai Kibaki and his Jubilee post that was a "reward" by the President."Luos need to be like a giraffe. They need to look beyond the August 8 election because life must go on," he said, adding he cannot join the "dirty Luo Nyanza politics of division".Tuju joked about Siaya Senator James Orengo's efforts to keep the hopes of the NASA team flaming through court cases in relation to the conduct of the IEBC.He categorically said that among the Siaya governor aspirants, he has strong reservations about incumbent Cornel Rasanga, who is Raila&rsquo;s choice but not the people's."The t-shirt I am wearing bears the RT abbreviation. It does not mean 'Rasanga Tena' but 'Raphael Tuju'," he told an enthusiastic crowd.He added Kenya should not be subjected to the violence of 1992 and 2007 that resulted from political disputes after elections.
