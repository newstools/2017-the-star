ODM&rsquo;s Nairobi women leaders have faulted the party for failing to consider them on the list of potential candidates for nomination slots.The 17 subcounty chairpersons said despite dedicating their efforts and time to the party, only two have been picked for nomination.Led by Lang&rsquo;ata constituency chairperson Lydia Akoth, they urged the party to review the list for city assembly nominees so it can have those who &ldquo;have worked tirelessly for the party&rdquo;.&ldquo;We have worked tirelessly for the last 10 years, but our efforts are not being recognised. The party leadership had promised to consider us for nomination slots, but that has not happened,&rdquo; Akoth said.She accused some people she did not name of changing the names provided initially and having others introduced on the list that was finally presented to the party headquarters.Speaking to the Star on the phone, branch chairman George Aladwa yesterday said he had considered the interests of all Nairobi women leaders.He said he had no idea that the list presented by the branch had been altered and some names removed. Aladwa acknowledged that the women leaders have sacrificed for the party.&ldquo;These ladies have worked for the party and I considered them for nomination. If someone edited the list I submitted, then it is unfair. I&rsquo;m taking it up with the party leader,&rdquo; he said.The women leaders, however, urged ODM leader Raila Odinga&rsquo;s wife Ida to intervene. Ida, in an earlier meeting with women politicians, pledged to ensure the party rewards devoted members.&ldquo;We want Ida to intervene because she promised to ensure we are considered,&rdquo; Florence Achieng&rsquo; of Kamukunji constituency said.The leaders said they have all paid the Sh20,000 fee and it will be wrong for the party to pick only two from 17.The number of slots accorded to each party will depend on its strength in terms of those elected on its ticket to the assembly.At the 2013 election, the then-Cord had the majority control of the assembly, beating President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s Jubilee coalition by a slim margin.
