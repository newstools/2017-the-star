The Court of Appeal in Nairobi has set aside orders allowing police officers to form and join trade unions.This means Attorney General Githu Muigai will not have to amend and lay down a legislative framework to guide and facilitate the process of police unions as had been directed by a lower court.Justice Onesmus Makau had in 2013 declared a section of the Labour Relations Act unconstitutional, saying it was inconsistent with Articles 41 and 24 of the Constitution.This is because it entirely took away the rights of the National Police Service to form, join and participate in all activities of a trade union. His ruling, therefore, meant the police could enjoy their constitutional right of freedom of association. The decision has now been overturned, following a successful appeal by the state.Appellate judges Alnashir Visram, Wanjiru Karanja and Martha Koome said four retired police officers, who were party to the suit, invoked a totally wrong procedure that eventually made them obtain orders against the other parties not in the case.&ldquo;The procedure they followed was foreign to the various Rules of Procedure. In the course of it, orders were made against parties who were not parties to the suit, thereby going against the established principle that every party is entitled to be heard,&rdquo; they said.On December 5, 2002, Nicky Njuguna, describing himself as a retired police officer, wrote to the Registrar of Trade Unions, seeking registration of a Police Trade Union under Section 10 of the then Trade Disputes Act. The registrar, however, declined the application in a letter dated January 9, 2007.Dissatisfied with the decision, Njuguna and three others appealed the decision on July 24, 2007, before the Industrial Court (now the Employment and Labour Relations Court). The appeal, which was supported by Cotu, was never heard as all the laws related to it were repealed and replaced by the Labour Relations Act ( 2007 ), the 2010 Constitution and the NPSA of 2011.The four officers then filed a new application, seeking a declaration that a section of the Labour Relations Act of 2007 as unconstitutional, saying it was inconsistent with Articles 41 and 24 of the Constitution. It was, however, dismissed.In Africa, only South Africa, Senegal, Malawi, Cote d&rsquo;Ivoire, Lesotho, Niger, Swaziland and Tunisia have recognised the right of their uniformed men and women to form trade unions to agitate for their rights.
