I personally do not think we have a close race; we are just avoiding doing one basic analysis. When you look at the demographic and the electoral map as per 2013, much has significantly shifted.For instance, look at the voting pattern for 2013 and look at the new electoral maps and you will find significantly all the major areas Cord (Now NASA) did not control, it has significantly got an entry point and also areas it had support in at a loose end it has solidified.Examples include the Maa community, Mandera, Wajir, Garissa and other Northland areas that were largely on Jubilee&rsquo;s side. Western was largely divided.Today, in these areas, you find the single largest of all vote groups have shifted to NASA.It is the way the politics is organised. Politics will remain ethnic. In most cases, people follow the leaders.What NASA got in Rift Valley within the Kalenjin community in 2013, it will get an increase of between 10 to 30 per cent. Jubilee has failed to consolidate their bases and NASA has really eaten large chunks of them. Jubilee is the same as it was in 2013.NASA has consolidated on leadership, which is broadly based on bringing everybody on board. It appeals across broad-based ethnic groups.When you see the exodus of members of the National Assembly and other leaders who command a following, however little it is, joining a certain political alignment, it tilts the ground fundamentally.We have a perception that there exists an undecided vote: It does not exist &ndash; it&rsquo;s just a perception.In the Kenyan context, it does not exist.One, it is about whether different formations of political actors have the ability to consolidate their voters to vote for them. Two, whether they will get those votes in large numbers.It is about who is able to mobilise and get their support to come out and vote in large numbers.Second, the ability to closely follow the details of who is voting, ensure the number of ballot papers is exact, monitor how tallying is done and ensure the actual people in the voter's register are the people voting.Also, ensure correct details in the voters&rsquo; register at every polling station are recorded. In 2013, the IEBC only accounted for 17,000 polling station out of the 33,000 documented at that time.Wainaina is the Executive Director, &lrm; International Center for Policy and Conflict
