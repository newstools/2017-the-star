Laiser Hill Academy have been cleared to take part in the upcoming East Africa Secondary School games next month in Gulu, Uganda.Laser Hill were re-admitted back for the regional show following a successful appeal over the ban handed to them earlier last week for allegedly fielding ineligible player.The former champions were handed suspension for alleged including Ephraim Oduor, a former Kakamega Boys High School student, in their 15&rsquo;s squad contrary to Kenya Secondary Schools Sports Association (KSSSA) regulations.According to KSSSA secretary general, David Ngugi, &ldquo;The accused player was a former Kakamega High School player, who failed to produce his original birth certificate, a requirement needed before a player features in the tournament. His former side launched a complain which was successful but Laiser wrote to request the player to be withdrawn from the squad they had given. The player never played in any competitive match. They appealed to the Ministry who accepted.&rdquo;The ruling will see St. Mary&rsquo;s Yala who had embarked on the preparations for the East Africa games wait for the next year&rsquo;s edition while it was met with jubilation by the Kajiado County-based school. St Mary&rsquo;s Yala, who finished fourth at the Nationals earlier in April, had been drafted as a replacement for Laiser Hill before the latter won their petition.
