Kajiado Central MP Elijah Memusi on Monday accused the government of using state resources to campaign for his opponent. The MP claimed he has evidence against the state and will use it in his complaint to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission. He told journalists outside the Kajiado CDF office that as a member of the national assembly, one of his roles is oversight. "We do this to ensure, on behalf of the people, that the government spends taxpayers' money in a prudent and transparent manner," he said. MemusiÂ claimed the Interior ministry has re-directed resources to facilitate campaigns for the Jubilee candidate in the constituency. "A vehicle belonging to Interior ministry of registration number KAE 612X, previously registered as GK 069R and driven by a prisons officer, is currently being used by a JP aspirant for Kajiado Central," the legislator said. He said this should not be encouraged especially while the country faces serious security threats. "It would not be prudent for the ministry to misappropriate scarce resources at the expense of securing the country," Memusi said. The legislator added he has raised the matter with acting Interior CS Fred Matiang'i. "If the ministry does not recall the vehicle, we shall exercise our sovereign powers, seize it peacefully and return it to the nearest police station." He also cautioned county commissioner Harsama Kello against engaging in Kajiado politics. Read: IEBC warns public servants over use of state resources in campaigns
