Supporters of JP Kirinyaga governor candidate Anne Waiguru on Thursday protested in Kerugoya town after her convoy was attacked at Kibingo shopping centre on Tuesday. The protesters — mostly women — urged police to act swiftly and bring culprits to book. One protester, only identified as Sarah, said police should provide security to candidates during campaigns, especially women because they are more vulnerable than their male competitors. The protesters marched to Kerugoya police station and were addressed by Kirinyaga county police boss David Kirui. Kirui (pictured) said he had dispatched riot police. He added that investigations are ongoing. The police boss said culprits will be brought to book once investigations are completed. Kirui warned the youth against allowing themselves to be misused. Waiguru’s campaign convoy was attacked by hooligans at Kibingo shopping centre in Kirinyaga Central. Some reports indicate that men in a Toyota Probox arrived at the rally and incited the youths. Waiguru’s chief campaigner Moses Waweru sustained head and chest injuries and is admitted at the Tenri Hospital in Embu county. The goons attempted to burn Waiguru’s Toyota Prado. Police fired in the air to rescue the candidate.
