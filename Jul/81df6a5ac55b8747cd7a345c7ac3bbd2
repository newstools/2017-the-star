President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto have asked the Kamba community to reelect them since NASA running mate Kalonzo Musyoka is not eyeing the presidency.Speaking in Matuu town yesterday, where they made a stopover from Masinga, Ruto said the race is between Uhuru and NASA flagbearer Raila Odinga, not Kalonzo.&ldquo;I have heard my friend Kalonzo say he has no problem with Uhuru, but some few issues with me. Since the race this round is between Uhuru and Raila, I am asking him to vote for Uhuru then we will sort out our differences in 2022,&rdquo; Ruto said. The DP said he will be ready to negotiate with Kalonzo in 2022 and if that fails, they will face each other at the ballot.&ldquo;Kalonzo and I can agree on a formula in 2022 and in the event we don&rsquo;t agree, we will square it out. But for now I am asking Kambas to walk with us in forming the next government,&rdquo; Ruto said.He said Jubilee has initiated many projects in the region, despite it voting for the opposition in 2013.&ldquo;In Machakos county alone we have tarmacked a 260km road network and connected 130,000 households to electricity. We have also [rehabilitated] the Yatta Canal, which was last done during the colonial times,&rdquo; Ruto said.Uhuru said they will beat NASA as everything points to Jubilee carrying the day in the polls.file&ldquo;If we beat them in 2013, when we were out of government and with the burden of the ICC cases on our backs, how do they expect to beat us this time round when we are the ones running the government?&rdquo; he said.Uhuru urged the Ukambani people to ignore Kalonzo and join him in forming the next government.&ldquo;I have no problem with my brother Kalonzo. All I am asking him to do si disassociate himself from the other fellow of &lsquo;vitendawili&rsquo; because he is taking him nowhere,&rdquo; he said.Uhuru hit out at NASA, saying it is a formation of people who have served long in the government but have nothing to show for it.&ldquo;They say they [stand] for change. What change are they bringing if they did not [rehabilitate] the canal all those years they have been in power? Is it change to take us forward or backwards?&rdquo; he said.The President said with the rehabilitation of the Yatta Canal, the acreage under irrigation has risen from 6,000 to 25,000.Uhuru and Ruto were accompanied by Garissa Township MP Aden Duale, Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko and other leaders.They drummed up support for candidates running for various seats on the Jubilee Party ticket.
