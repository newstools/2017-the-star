The European Union has expressed concern over possible violence during the August 8 General Election.EU Election Observation Mission chief observer Marietje Schaake yesterday urged Kenyans to shun violence and promote peace before, during and after the election &mdash; now 34 days away.She urged all actors in the electoral process to quell rising tension.Schaake spoke during the launch of the EU Election Observation Mission in Nairobi. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a secret that there are concerns about a possible outbreak of violence. It has come to my attention that there are people in Kenya who are concerned about violence,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;It is clear that it would create a situation where everybody loses. But this responsibility grows in proportion to the influence different actors have over the 2017 election.&rdquo;Schaake &mdash; a member of the European Parliament from the Netherlands &mdash; said &ldquo;each Kenyan should be granted the right and safety to vote according to his or her conscience.&rdquo;She said the mission is aimed at making honest and impartial assessment of the integrity of the process and the extent to which the electorate&rsquo;s rights are upheld.Schaake said, &ldquo;The fact that the EU has deployed such a large mission is testimony to the significance of the August 8 election. It is evident how much the campaign is already leading to lively discussions in Kenya.&rdquo;The EU mission has met with the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission to gauge whether it is fully prepared to conduct the forthcoming polls.Schaake has held discussions with the electoral body on elements of the entire process from registration, organisation and testing, distribution and verifying of election materials.&ldquo;The IEBC has come out and said they are ready. Those are their own words, but we are more interested in looking at the details of the process. We&rsquo;re waiting for more details so we can gauge whether the body is fully prepared,&rdquo; she said.The mission will engage with more players to get an inclusive picture of the election.Schaake said observers will be looking at the way the Kenyan and international laws are upheld and respected in practice during the entire process.Last week, the mission deployed 30 observers to assess the electoral process &mdash; including campaigns &mdash; in 13 locations across the country.
