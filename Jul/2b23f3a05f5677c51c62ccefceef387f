A conflict
has arisen between Homa Bay MCAs and speaker Samuel Ochillo over
performance after the speaker said they underperformed. He released the scorecard last Thursday. “On most
occasions I would go to the assembly without anything for discussion because
the MCAs had failed to generate the House business,” he said. Ochillo said the MCAs were lazy. The assembly was dissolved last Thursday.
