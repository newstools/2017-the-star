The Second Liberation Forum is an organisation with a commitment not just to celebrate the history and heroes of democracy, but also unite the country by urging Kenyans to elect leaders from all communities.This forum is committed to the attainment of Third and final Liberation of this country, which will rescue Kenyans from the shackles of abject poverty, unemployment, hunger, endless strikes by desperate workers, ever skyrocketting cost of living and unaffordable prices of maize flour, bread, milk and other basic commodities.It also urges the Kikuyu to gain enough courage to elect Raila Odinga as the fifth President of Kenya.With this vision, the Second Liberation Forum is not urging Kenyans, and especially the Kikuyus, to elect Raila because he is a Luo. No. We are calling on Kenyans to elect him because, so far, he is the only presidential candidate who has announced his readiness to rescue Kenyans from the desert of misery, economic and political oppression, and take them across the River Jordan to the Promised Land. There, we will have no more dictatorship of Jubilee Party that has already announced its undemocratic intention to keep power for 20 years, no more corruption that attacks, eats up and kills Kenyans with absolute impunity, and no more negative ethnicity that will keep Kenyans of different communities divided, fighting and killing one another.Though it is true that leaders should be elected mainly on the basis of merit, it is not possible that merit to be President only comes from one community. It is found in persons of all communities. There must be something amiss, therefore, when three out of four Kenyan presidents come from the Kikuyu community and when President Uhuru teams up with Deputy President Willaim Ruto to be in power for another term and thereafter return the presidency to the Kalenjin community, from whom the second President came. There is a need for the Kikuyu and the Kalenjin elites to reassure other Kenyans that they too carry merit to lead by electing Raila as president.Becoming president is a very rare position in all countries and should only be given to a person who qualifies to serve people best and in a manner that no other person can. Returning the presidency to a person who has already been there for one term should be because that he or she is so qualified that the country would lose enormously if they don&rsquo;t get another term.Yet looking at President Uhuru&rsquo;s qualifications, service of country, developing every single centre of Kenya, uplifting the life of every single Kenyan and curbing corruption, dictatorship and negative ethnicity that we must eradicate to develop, he does not fit the bill for reelection.As a person who sacrificed his freedom for many years, fighting with others for the liberation of this country from the shackles of one-party dictatorship, and one who has now dared risk being Joshua to rescue the poor of this country from the desert of poverty and misery, of all the persons who are vying for the presidency this year, Raila is the best qualified. Indeed, if he is elected President, he will represent Mau Mau freedom fighters, who fought for Independence and fighters of Second Liberation. Hopefully, Raila will then do better than Kenyatta, Moi, Kibaki and Uhuru. When Kikuyus of the Second Liberation Front urge Kikuyu people to elect Raila as president, it is because they remember his father Jaramogi Oginga Odinga urged Luo people and other Kenyans to elect Uhuru&rsquo;s father Jomo Kenyatta, who was a Kikuyu, to be first president of Kenya and Raila himself urged his Luo people to elect Mwai Kibaki another Kikuyu to be third president of Kenya. If it was then not an abomination for Raila and his father to urge Luo people to elect Kikuyus to be president, it cannot be an abomination for Kikuyus in the Second Liberation Forum to urge the Kikuyu community to elect Raila Odinga the fifth president of Kenya. Indeed they will only be returning a favour that will make them better people.If Kikuyu people elect Raila as fifth president of Kenya, they will also make themselves better people and erase a belief among many people that Kikuyu people are not capable of electing president someone who is not Kikuyu.This then is to urge the Kikuyu people to elect Raila because he is better qualified than Uhuru to be President.This also is an endorsement of Raila&rsquo;s election as the fifth President of Kenya by the Second Liberation Forum, and to urge other organisations and companies to follow suit.To actualise this endorsement, the Second Liberation Forum will recruit a million voters for NASA in the Mount Kenya region.
