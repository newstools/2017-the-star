An AP officer from Kamagambo police station has been arrested for allegedly raping a university student. Speaking to the Star in his office on Thursday, Rongo police boss Jonathan Kisaka said the officer and his two colleagues were on night patrol when the incident occurred. A student from the Jaramogi Oginga Odinga University of Science and Technology in Siaya county had arrived in Rongo town at 10pm on Tuesday night and needed fare to travel home. She met the three officers and they promised to take her home. But she was instead taken to the police quarters, where she was raped throughout the night. “On Wednesday morning, the girl managed to escape from the house and went home. She alerted her parents and they reported the matter at Kamagambo police station,” Kisaka said. He said despite the fear from the girl and her parents that the case was going to be thrown out because the office was stationed there “we made an arrest”. “The complainant took us to the officer’s home, positively identified him and we arrested him. His colleagues also recorded police statements over the incident,” Kisaka said. He said officers ensured investigation were conducted through a medical report to have a concrete case, which was forwarded to the Migori law courts. The officer will face rape charges. Kisaka praised the girl and her parents for coming forward and reporting the incident. He said most victims are often afraid when police officers are involved in a crime. “Days are gone when security officers felt they were above the law. We are here to serve wananchi. We need to have a positive public image among officers,” Kisaka said. On July 1, Rongo University students said they live in fear after more than 15 people were robbed in Rongo town in less than a week. The students have been attacked as they leave their hostels, especially in the Rongo town campus. Muggers target money, mobile phones and laptops.
