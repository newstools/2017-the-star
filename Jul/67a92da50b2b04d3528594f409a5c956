IDPs from Bondo subcounty have warned the Jubilee government against politicising their compensation.They said if the government is not ready to compensate them then it should not play politicise their plight.Addressing the press in Bondo on Monday the group asked why only a few IDPs were compensated in the region. &ldquo;Why sideline more than 900 members who were displaced during the 2007-08 post-election violence if the move to compensate us is genuine?&rdquo; Bondo coordinator James Ngesa said.&ldquo;The list from the bank contains names of people we do not know. We only know of IDPs in the original list that was presented to the government in 2009. The rest are Jubilee sympathisers.&rdquo;He said out of the few individuals whose KCB accounts have been credited with Sh50,000, forty are not IDPs.
