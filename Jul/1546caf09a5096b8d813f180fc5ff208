NASA principal Kalonzo Musyoka on Friday said Kitui governor candidates David Musila and Charity Ngilu will get influential CS jobs in the NASA administration if they lose on August 8. Ngilu (Narc) and Musila (Independent) are facing off against incumbent Julius Malombe. “Hon Ngilu will get a substantive Cabinet post. I’ve spoken to Musila and told him he will get a powerful docket like being the Transport CS,” Kalonzo said. He said the two leaders would not be allowed to disappear into the political abyss. Kalonzo spoke during a morning talk show on Musyi FM radio station. He said that as the Wiper leader, he has to back Malombe’s bid, but that does not mean he is against Ngilu and Musila. “I’ve told Hon Ngilu that she is the Narc leader and I’m the Wiper leader. I, therefore, have to campaign for Malombe — my party candidate,” Kalonzo said. He also said he is impressed that Kamba leaders have come together in unity of purpose for the community’s benefit, praising Ngilu, Governor Kivutha Kibwana and Wavinya Ndeti for the role they played to make it a reality.
