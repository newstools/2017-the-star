Fresh from recording a 7-1 win away in Lobatse, Botswana during the preliminary round of the 2018 Under 20 women’s World Cup Qualifier, the national team is leaving nothing to chance as they return to residential training in Machakos. The team have more or less progressed to the first round if the weekend score-line is anything. However, they will have to host Botswana in the return leg on August 4 at the Jomo Kenyatta Stadium, Machakos. Should Kenya complete a double against the visitors they will play Ethiopia away in September.. Football Kenya Federation (FKF) communication officer Barry Otieno noted that the team is continuing with the training ahead of the return leg and won’t take them for granted when they come calling . “The team headed to camp after landing on Saturday from Botswana. They are progressing on with training since we want them to complete the good work they begun away,” said Otieno “As a federation we are happy with the away win but we don’t want the girls to be over-confident and that is why the technical bench is not leaving anything to chance to ensure all the departments are working in unison ahead of the clash.” The official, however, revealed the team will break camp on Friday for the players to link up with their family before they return on Sunday. “Most of these players are drawn from secondary schools and it has been a while since they were with their families and it is only fair that we accord them the chance to see them,” he added. The technical bench led by Caroline Ajowi are unlikely to change the team which is dominated by secondary school players who were impressive during the away clash. The players were picked during the recently concluded Airtel Rising Stars national secondary school Term Two B Games in Nyeri Marjolene Nafula and Martha Emedot scored a brace each with the regular national team player Harambee Starlets’ midfielder Corazone Aquino, Diana Mwihaki and Cynthia Masungu scoring a goal each.
