Kevin Ombajo, popularly known as Big Kev, is dead. The event organiser was diagnosed with a benign brain tumour in 2010 and has been battling it until his death on Saturday. It is reported that he passed away at 8pm at the Nairobi Hospital. Big Kev was admitted in Nairobi Hospital in February, and friends and relatives made as much effort to go visit him as they could. In October last year, Big Kev lost his eyesight after undergoing an operation. He fought a good fight and we will forever remember him for never giving up, despite going through so much pain. May his soul rest in eternal peace.
