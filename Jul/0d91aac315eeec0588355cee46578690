The government has disbursed Sh12 billon under the Youth Enterprise Fund. Fund CEO Josiah Moriasi urged youths to take loans and set up businesses. “Initially youths were required to be in a group of 12 members, today
we only require them to be five to qualify for a loan,” he said. The government has increased the minimum loan from Sh50,000 to Sh100,000. Moriasi was speaking during a youth empowerment programme in Kitale He said youth who borrow Sh100,000 loans will also qualify
for Sh25,000 each, so in total they will take home Sh250,000. Once they take the loans, beneficiaries will be required
to pay five per cent management fee. The loans are interest-free. All that is required to qualify for a loan is a registration certificate. Packages on offer include the Talanta loan, which is given to youths to nurture their talents. The minimum is Sh300,000. Also on offer are agribusiness loans to encourage youths to venture into farming. Youths can take up Sh2 million. Moriasi said the government had opened more offices at the subcounties to process the loans.
