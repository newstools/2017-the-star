Bungoma Ford Kenya governor nominee Wycliffe Wangamati has said if elected his government will comprise all the subtribes in the nine constituencies in the county. He expressed high hopes that Ford Kenya will form the next county government and asked residents to votes for the party’s MCA candidates. Wangamati lashed out at Governor Kenneth Lusaka for allegedly presiding over a tribal County Public Service Board, whose “majority of staff are from Lusaka’s clan”. He said the current staff do not represent the face of the county. Wangamati spoke to residents of Mihuu ward, Webuye East constituency, on Friday when he unveiled his running mate, Charles Ngome. He said Ngome, who was born in Webuye East, but resides in Tongaren constituency, will help put the votes from the two constituencies in one basket. “I want to assure all the tribes living here in Bungoma of Sabaot, Iteso, Tachoni, Bukusu, Tura, Kisii, Luo and Kikuyu that the government of Wangamati will ensure all these tribes will be inside the government’s departments,” Wangamati said. He also pledged to prioritise education. Wangamati said they will build a technical college in every subcounty to help those who finish form four, but are not admitted in universities. He also said he will ensure every person will be a member of the NHIF and the county government will pay the premiums on behalf of the wananchi. Ngome said he will work closely with Wangamati to bring back the county’s lost glory.
