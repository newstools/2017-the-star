President Uhuru Kenyatta and his NASA archrival Raila Odinga are battling to win over 2.8 million elderly voters. The two protagonists, who have rolled out aggressive campaigns to woo the senior citizens, have promised ambitious safety nets. Figures by the IEBC puts voters above the age of 55 at 2.8 million. Uhuru has promised that all those aged 70 and above will receive a Sh3,000 monthly stipend each. They will have a fully paid health insurance scheme as part of the benefits. “From next year, everyone over the age of 70 will be enrolled in the programme to protect their dignity and be in control of their lives,” Uhuru said. NASA, led by Raila, has launched a barrage of attacks on the government, saying the programme is a campaign gimmick aimed at hoodwinking vulnerable Kenyans. But he has also promised the elderly a monthly allowance of Sh3,500 that comes with an enhanced medical cover. NASA says it will put all those aged above 65 in the programme. NASA leaders plan to roll out the programme from September this year.
