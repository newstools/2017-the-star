Boinnet spoke after meeting seven directors from prisons, forest, the Kenya Defence Forces, DCI, AP and Kenya police departments.The institutions will help police in security management during and after the elections. Boinnet said he is not aware of claims by Raila that eight people suspected to be APs have been trailing him.He said the former Prime Minister had adequate security to deal with any security threats against him.
