The Health department failed yesterday, for the second time, to release results of an investigation into the cholera aoutbreak at the Weston Hotel.More than 50 people, mostly medics attended a health conference, were sickened and hospitalised on June 22. All were discharged.Several doctors, who tested themselves, said they had contracted cholera. They alleged cover-up when the city was slow to acknowledge cholera.The results of the probe were expected to be made public yesterday. A task force had been formed by Health executive Bernard Muia to investigate the incident. Health officials initially said it was probably just food poisoning but later had to backtrack.Yesterday, Muia said the team is yet to conclude the investigations as it is &ldquo;still putting some heads together&rdquo;.&ldquo;This is scientific research, which obviously takes time. The committee is working [backward from the incident] to know the cause and where the condition came from,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Also, of course where the two levels of governments are involved there must be processes, which take time.&rdquo;He did not give a specific date when the results would be released, only saying, &ldquo;we expect it soon.&rdquo;Governor Evans Kidero had instructed Muia to investigate and release the results in two days. That would have been on June 27.But Muia said it was practically impossible to conduct scientific research in two days. He formed a 15-member task force comprising the county health officials, the Ministry of Health, Doctors Without Borders, Amref, the Kenya Red Cross and the Nairobi Water and Sewerage Company.Muia had said the outcome of the probe would be made public in two weeks, which ended yesterday.Two week ago the county confirmed that tests from the National Public Health Laboratory showed that six out of 24 samples from 50 admitted patients tested positive for cholera.The hotel is associated with Deputy President William Ruto.
