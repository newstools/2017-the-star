Three schools in Witu division, Lamu county have been unable to resume learning for the last two weeks for fear of being attacked by Al-Shabaab militants. Over 600 pupils of Pandanguo, Kakathe and Maleli primary schools have not gone back to school after Alshabaab destroyed a school in their recent attack in the area. According to Witu sub-county education officer, James Akello, the schools were closed immediately after the terror attack on Pandanguo police post last week that left four police officers dead. Pandanguo primary school has a total of 196 pupils, Kakathe has 220 while Maleli has 176 pupils total. "My office had to immediately withdraw the more than 20 teachers who were serving in the schools over concern for their security but they would be posted back once security is restored", he said.

We had to take them off but will have them back once security is guaranteed. Maybe next week the schools might re-open, let's wait and see,”Akello said. Parents have also expressed concern over the safety of their children in the schools and constant disruptions of their learning due to the constant Alshabaab raids. They urged the national government to establish a permanent KDF camp at Pandanguo. Some parents in Pandanguo said they are planning to transfer their children to the Witu primary school which is over 21 kilometres away. “We have class eight pupils who need to sit KCPE this year. Schools are closed and that means our children are missing out a lot on learning. Time is running out and the exams are almost here,” said Pandanguo elder Adan Golja.
