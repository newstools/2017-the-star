Residents in Gatundu South on Friday came from far and wide to see a stillborn deformed lamb they said had human features.Waweru Wanyoike said he was called by his elderly neighbour Mary Muiruri to slaughter her sheep, which had died in labour.&ldquo;I started to slaughter the dead sheep to remove the lamb, but I saw something I have never seen before. The lamb had features of a human being, with only a few hairy patches on the neck,&rdquo; he told the Star.At least 300 people flocked to the homestead in Karembu village, Kiamwangi location, to see the creature as word spread.A veterinary officer who visited the home said the deformation most likely occurred as a result of improper mutation. He said a man cannot impregnate a sheep.
