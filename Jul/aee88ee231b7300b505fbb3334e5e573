While President Uhuru Kenyatta is criss-crossing the country launching mega projects, CSs are in a rush to launch projects to woo voters ahead of next month’s election. In the last two months, the CSs and PSs have been touring parts of the country trying to fulfill pledges President Uhuru Kenyatta made in 2013. Officials from the gender, energy, roads, information, education and labour ministries have been among the most visible during campaigns. Gender CS Sicily Kariuki has launched the recruitment of youths to the NYS Empowerment Programme in 180 constituencies. She intends to cover all the 290 constituencies before August 8. This weekend, she will be in Kericho county to launch the programme. “So far, the NYS Youth Empowerment Programme has enrolled 150,000 youths across the country. The youth comprise more than half of our country’s population and there is a need to cater to their need for economic empowerment.This is not only done through employment, but also through supporting young entrepreneurs by offering them interest-free credit,” Kariuki said on Monday. She urged Kenyans aged 35 and below to use cash in funds well.The Labour ministry under CS Phyllis Kandie has also been active. Kandie has been criss-crossing the country launching initiatives to help the poor, elderly, orphans and people living with disability. When launching his reelection blueprint last month, Uhuru promised that if reelected, his administration will double the number of elderly people under the cash transfer programme dubbed Inua Jamii from 700,000 to 1.4 million. The drive will include citizens above the age of 70.
