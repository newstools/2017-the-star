Nyandarua integrated IDPs have urged the government to suspend the payment of the Sh382 million set aside to compensate them. They said fresh vetting should first be conducted to weed out fake IDPs. Speaking in Ol kalou on Saturday, representatives Simon Ndirangu, and Mary Njeri said if fresh vetting is not conducted, many legitimate IDPs will suffer. Ndirangu said most people on the compensation list own land in Nyandarua and elsewhere and should not be given money. He said the genuine IDPs should go to Ol Kalou town for vetting. “We want all of us to meet at the Ol Kalou Stadium so we get to know one another and remove the thugs among us,” Ndirangu said. The IDPs said they have no faith in their coordinator James Mwaura and other officials. They accused the officials of introducing fake IDPs to the list “to make a fortune”. Njeri urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to intervene because their efforts to have administrators in Nyandarua solve the issue have failed. “We have gone through hell and when some little money is finally availed, they bring a fake register. Even Uhuru, our beloved president will see the register is not authentic if fresh vetting is done,” she said. IDPs Jack Mwangi and Geoffrey Mwaura said they have suffered enough.
