Election Observation Group wants clarifications from the IEBC on those who made it to the voters&rsquo; roll.This comes as concerns and public pressure grow on the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission to explain why some names of dead people are still listed as voters and why some invalid ID numbers return records of people on the voters&rsquo; list.This is despite a voter verification and the KPMG audit, which was expected to clean up the register by removing ghost voters and other anomalies.Questions on registerYesterday, in their election state of preparedness report, ELOG asked for an explanation on what happened to 2,610 voters who registered with both an ID and passport.It also questioned what happened to the 264,242 voters with either a duplicate ID or passport and those with &lsquo;out of range&rsquo; details in the register of voters.When addressing the status of 171,476 records that had invalid IDs when checked against the National Registration Bureau database, the IEBC reported a decision to maintain the same in the register was reached to avoid disenfranchising concerned voters.&ldquo;Of concern to ElOG, out of 17,523 voters whose details could not be found in the data on the passports provided by the Directorate of Immigration, how many were included in the register?&rdquo; ELOG steering committee chairperson Regina Opondo asked.Clarify voter listThe group said issues emanating from the voter list must be clarified.Josephine Mongare, the group&rsquo;s co-convener, noted that there has been a consistent flouting of the Election Act witnessed by open voter bribery in form of money, food and services, by all major political parties, candidates and even independents.&ldquo;It was reported recently in parts of Mathira, Othaya and Tetu constituencies, where chiefs and subchiefs have been linked with campaigning for Jubilee Party,&rdquo; she said.Attacks have been meted out by political opponents and their supporters on the campaign trail across the divide as well as vandalism of campaign materials, and incidences of hate speech and threatening languages during campaigns, the May-June report states.
