AN MP from the Nyanza region who lost favour with ODM has sworn to teach the party and its leadership a lesson for 'rigging' him out in the nominations, even after his contributing and donating millions to the party coffers. Over the weekend, our mole eavesdropped when the flamboyant MP chest-thumped on a phone call how he will use all his resources to ensure ODM does not field a candidate in the constituency. He also vowed to repossess all monetary favours he had extended to an individual working around Raila Odinga's secretariat who has ganged up with his challenger to fight him.*****DID President Uhuru Kenyatta shoot himself in the foot during his Ukambani campaign tour last week? Right. Uhuru, persuading the Kamba community to back his reelection and to deny NASA votes in the August polls told them not to vote along tribal lines, but consider one's development record. The JP presidential candidate's remarks, however, did not go well with many, especially on social media. Uhuru's critics on Twitter, for example, termed his sentiments as "scoring an own goal" and accused him of double standards. They questioned why the President was not preaching the same message to his tribesmen during his campaigns in Mt Kenya.
