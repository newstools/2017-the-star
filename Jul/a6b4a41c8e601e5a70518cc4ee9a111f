A storm is brewing in ODM, as members press tough questions to party bosses on the criteria used in arriving at the party&rsquo;s nomination lists.Already, there is growing disquiet among the Orange Party supporters, who claimed that loyalists who have served the party over the years were sidelined in favour of politically correct individuals.Many claimed that top party officials changed names at the last minute and introduced cronies who have never played any role in the party.Fingers now point at chairman John Mbadi and director of elections Junet Mohammed, whom insiders claimed changed and flooded the list of nominees, especially those of MCAs, with people close to them.&ldquo;Mbadi and Junet messed us. There are instances where they removed and replaced those already nominated and replaced them with their own people who have never served the party,&rdquo; said an ODM insider who did not wish to be named.Didn&rsquo;t compromise nomination listBoth Mbadi and Junet denied claims of unduly interfering in the nomination process.Mbadi admitted he had a hand in the nomination list, but only in line with his role as the national chairman.He, however, confirmed recommending three nominees from his constituency, who he claimed were qualified and had served the party.&ldquo;As far as I am concerned, we picked people who have served the party quite well. Slots are limited and you cannot have everybody who has served the party included,&rdquo; Mbadi said on the phone.Junet dismissed the allegations, terming them &ldquo;scapegoats&rdquo; by people who failed to make it to the final list.The nomination of Kenya National Union of Teachers secretary general Wilson Sossion has ruffled feathers.&ldquo;We also take care of other interests. During Okoa Kenya, we had partnerships with civil society and trade unions.&ldquo;If we want the interest of the workers to be represented, then those workers must come through parties,&rdquo; Mbadi said while defending Sossion&rsquo;s nomination.As ODM supporters were protesting the alleged Mbadi-Junet cronies and relatives, Jubilee on the other hand were aggrieved by the inclusion of nominated Senator Beth Mugo and Starehe MP Maina Kamanda in the nomination list.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very disappointed with my party Jubilee for nominating Maina Kamanda and Beth Mugo as MPs. When will we have a chance as the youths? It is a big shame that should not happen in this century,&rdquo; Josiah Muriguh said.He ran and lost in the Jubilee primary for Kirinyaga Central MP. Parties had up to Saturday last week to submit their lists to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission.
