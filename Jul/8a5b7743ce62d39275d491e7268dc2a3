Barely two months after losing her ex-husband Ivan Ssemwanga, Diamond Platnumz' wife Zari Hassan is mourning again. She has lost her mother. Zari’s mother passed away while undergoing treatment at Nakasero Hospital in Kampala, Uganda. Mrs Halima Hassan was hospitalised last month after she suffered a heart attack, and after spending a few days in hospital, she returned home. But again she was re-admitted at Nakasero, where she died early yesterday morning at the age of 58. The Ugandan socialite and her siblings spent the better part of last week camping at the hospital, hoping that their loved one would return home, but that was not to be. The mother of five took to social media to share the sad news. She wrote, "It's with deep sorrow that my family and I announce the death of our lovely mother who passed on this morning. May her soul rest in peace. May Allah forgive you your sins and grant you Jana. You will forever be loved our Old Sun, us as your kids were given the best from God as our mother. We appreciate all you did for us. We will forever cherish you Mama. Sleep well." Zari’s fans condolled with her. Jacinta Kasule: 2017 claimed your loved ones be strong dear, loosing a mother is something which causes pain forever, condolences to your family, RIP dear mom. Carol Makena: Aki Zari I personally feel you, you’ve gone through alot, and I know God doesn’t tempt you with anything that you can’t afford, may He give you strength and peace of mind at this trying moment.May my sincere condolences reach friends n family.Am so sorry zari. Zari had just returned to South Africa to see her children last weekend.
