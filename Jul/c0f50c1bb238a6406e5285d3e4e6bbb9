Jubilee Party hopes to get 25 per cent of the Kuria community’s votes in the presidential race in Migori county, the backyard of NASA flagbearer Raila Odinga. The ethnic group, a minority in the county, commands 22 per cent of Migori’s votes and is considered a battleground. Jubilee is banking on projects it has initiated, which include tarmacking of Muhuru-Kehancha road. Others are establishing two Technical Training Institutes and Kenya Medical College. The community has 86,211 votes (Kuria West’s 51,057 and Kuria East ‘s 35,154 ). Jubilee believes it has made inroads buoyed by the 2013 results which saw the party share the votes with the opposition, almost equally. Migori county Jubilee chairman Chacha Mosambi yesterday told the Star President Uhuru Kenyatta’s visit to the region last Friday increased his chances of attaining more than 25 per cent of votes in the county. “We plan to get majority votes in the Kuria region to attain our goal. Migori will deliver,” Mosambi said. Uhuru and Raila have campaigned in the region in the same month, with NASA hunting for votes on June 30. On Friday, Jubilee promised to create two subcounties – Ntimaru and Mabera – in Kuria East and Kuria West. Jubilee leaders led by Kuria West MP Mathias Robi said they will ensure the community reelects Jubilee. On June 22, more than 500 youths and ODM party officials from the Bwirege clan, which has supported Raila since 1997, defected to Jubilee. Ntimaru East MCA candidate Augustine Mwera was among the defectors. During his vist, Raila said it is a miscalculation for UhuRuto to bank on the community’s votes. “I know and I am closer to the problems affecting the Kuria as we shared the same province. NASA is more at home with the community than Jubilee,” Raila said.
