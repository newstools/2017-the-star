Leaders from Western Kenya have termed a promise by Deputy President William Ruto to name Water and Irrigation Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa as his running mate in the 2022 General Election as an insult to the Luhya community.MPs Andrew Toboso (Butere), Enock Kibunguchy (Likuyani), Yusuf Chanzu (Vihiga) and Kakamega Amani National Congress senatorial aspirant Cleophas Malala said the Luhya were focused on the Presidency and not the running mate position.Toboso said only a fool would fall prey to the DP&rsquo;s remarks because a running mate cannot be named five years to an election.&ldquo;Ruto is playing former President Moi&rsquo;s tricks where non-existent positions were dangled to communities to secure votes, but it won&rsquo;t work. Budalang&rsquo;i MP Ababu Namwamba has been promised the same seat,&rdquo; he said.Chanzu said Luhya leaders are focused on how to achieve elusive unity in the community as they prepare to field one of their own for the Presidency in 2022.He said Wamalwa was desperate to be in government and warned that he risked fading into political oblivion.&ldquo;ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi worked with President Uhuru Kenyatta and Ruto when they were in a tight corner during the ICC cases. They even signed an agreement making Mudavadi the Jubilee flagbearer, but they later reneged, citing the influence of &ldquo;dark forces&rdquo;. How can one believe them now?&rdquo; he said.Chanzu said there was no way Wamalwa can purport to speak on behalf of Luhyas because he is a resident of the Rift Valley.He said Mudavadi would take over from NASA&rsquo;s presidential candidate Raila Odinga in 2022 as the Luhya spokesman.Speaking in Bungoma on Monday, Ruto urged the region to support Jubilee for a better chance of ascending to power in the future.Kibunguchy said Ruto and Wamalwa can&rsquo;t be president and deputy because both are from the North Rift.
