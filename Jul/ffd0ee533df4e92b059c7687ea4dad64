The Nairobi food scene is constantly growing and changing, giving those who live here an eclectic variety of food options.One scene that has seen a rise in popularity is Asian food and there are a number of restaurants that cater to different regions of the continent.The most recent is Emerald Garden, which is rebranding to provide a unique and delicious selection of pan Asian cuisine.Originally known for its Thai food, the restaurant, located on UN avenue, will be known as Pan Asian Yao and offer a variety of dishes from across Asia.Pan Asian food is a selection of recognisable dishes from various Asian cuisines, and Pan Asian Yao has provided this in the form of Malaysian, Indonesian, Chinese and Indian Bento trays. Created by Executive Chef Rahul Rana, each bento tray (charged at Sh800), includes a selection of dishes beautifully presented that take you on a culinary trip around Asia.The restaurant recently held a tasting to introduce the new menu, and each item did not disappoint.The Malaysian tray included a spectacular noodle dish while the won ton salad on the Chinese tray was a particular favourite. Along with one of the best biryani I&rsquo;ve had in Nairobi, the Indian tray included a portion of beautifully spiced chicken wings.Accompanying the dishes were a selection of sauces that paired perfectly with the bento trays and were an integral part of another of their new introductions &ndash; their Hot Pot.Hot pot is a traditional Chinese dish cooked at your table as you eat, usually enjoyed as part of a group.A broth of your choice is brought to your table, which have individual inbuilt stoves, and you are given a selection of ingredients such as fresh seafood, beef, chicken, and vegetables to add to the dish.Not only is it delicious, it also is the perfect meal to have with a group of family or friends. It&rsquo;s an interactive experience of trying different combinations of sauces and ingredients, meaning that almost every mouthful is a new experience.Pan Asian Yao will officially open in July. If you are looking for a wonderful selection of Asian food in a fantastic setting, then I recommend you give it a visit.
