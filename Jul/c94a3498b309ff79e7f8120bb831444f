Independent presidential candidate Peter Gichira wants the August 8 general election called off and a caretaker government formed.Gichira noted this is on grounds that the IEBC is ill-prepared for the election.He said the caretaker government should start preparations for a new election in two years.Among the tasks the candidate proposed is for this government is conducting a referendum to change the constitution.He said the referendum should separate IEBC functions of registering voters and managing the register and elections.Gichira demanded the resignation of electoral agency chairman Wafula Chebukati, chief executive Ezra Chiloba and all commissioners."They are incompetent and dishonest and have on several occasions violated the constitution. IEBC's ill-preparedness is a recipe for chaos."The hopeful noted the risk of violent outbursts is high since issues on IEBC's preparedness and the commissioners' integrity have not been addressed."We don&rsquo;t want to go into an election just for the sake of it. We want a proper election that must not result in the loss of innocent lives as was the case in 2007."Gichira cited the controversial Al Ghurair tender, irregularities in the audited voter's register and failure to conduct voter education as some of the grounds.Addressing journalists at Laico Regency Hotel in Nairobi on Tuesday, he said the IEBC "is not of sound mind" yet this is required for a free and fair election next month."A recent attempt by the IEBC to sanitise the voters&rsquo; register through the SMS number 70000 failed terribly. Dead and ghost voters have resurfaced," he said."The referee has offered free resurrection orders for any willing dead to come out of their graves and vote," Gichira added.The candidate shot to the limelight in May when he attempted to jump from the IEBC's offices at the Anniversary Towers. This was after the commission declined to clear him to run for the seat.Read: Police arrest presidential hopeful Solomon Gichira after suicide attemptAlso read: Gichira petitions court to force IEBC to accept papersGichira said the questionable procurement of voting kits and ballot papers, and voter register audit flaws show the polls body does not have good faith in its actions."Kenyans must be afforded an enabling environment to vote leaders of their choice rather than have pre-determined winners pushed down their throats," he said.
