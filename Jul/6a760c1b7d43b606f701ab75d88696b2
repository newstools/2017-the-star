Nairobi police commander Japheth Koome yesterday said the service have laid out a security plan which will involve deploying personnel from all security agencies &mdash; including the Kenya Prisons Service, KWS, Kenya Forest Service and the National Youth Service &mdash; to secure all parts of the city. He said security will be adequately beefed up as it hosts the national tallying centre at Bomas. Koome&rsquo;s assurance came a day after EU elections observers warned of possible post-election violence. &ldquo;This city is greater than all of us. We have a responsibility to ensure there is calm and tranquility, as we go to election and even during the announcement of the outcome,&rdquo; Koome said at Utalii Hotel, where he met senior commanders. &ldquo;The security plan is ready and all agencies are represented.&rdquo; He said his officers will be impartial and their responsibility will be to ensure safety for all without fear or favour.
