The Jubilee government plans to deploy military personnel in areas perceived to be NASA strongholds during the August 8 polls, nominated MP Oburu Oginga has claimed. Oburu, who is a member of the coalition’s presidential campaign team in Nyanza region, claimed the military officers will wear AP uniforms. He said there will be 150 officers each in Kisumu, Migori, Siaya, Homa Bay and Kisii. Speaking after attending a church service at St Stephen’s ACK in Kisumu on Sunday, Oginga said NASA has evidence on the planned deployment. He wondered whether KDF chief Samuel Mwathethe is aware his staff are going to be deployed to Nyanza. “I wonder why the Inspector General of Police would tell the government there is shortage of police officers in these counties that warrants the deployment,” Oginga said.
