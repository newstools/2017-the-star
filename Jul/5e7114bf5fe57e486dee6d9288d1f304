Deputy President William Ruto (pictured)shocked the public on Monday by ordering deputy county commissioner Peter Lotulya to promote assistant chief Diana Owano immediately. “County commissioner ako wapi? Patia huyu mama Diana barua akuwe acting chief kuanzia kesho,” he said. This translates to, “Where is the county commissioner? Give this woman Diana an appointment letter as the acting chief starting tomorrow.” His pronouncement is reminiscent of the Kanu days, when government staff were appointed and fired through roadside proclamations. Ruto made the statement as he addressed a rally at Seregea market in Kakamega. Water CS Eugene Wamalwa was present.
