A milling company and shop owners in Garissa have called for more subsidised unga and maize. They said the ration received does not meet the growing demand for unga. “Contrary to the general belief that the Somali community’s staple food is rice, the community is fast embracing the consumption of ugali,” said Abdi Mohamed, who runs a retail shop in Garissa Ndogo. Hassan Ibrahim, the owner of Garissa Milling Company, said they ordered 1,800 50kg bags, but only received 1,180. He urged the government to stock the National Cereals and Produce Board with subsidised maize so they don’t run out of milling supply. “We are forced to get maize from Moyale-based Ethiopian maize trade when we run out of stock. We buy a 90kg bag at Sh4,200, which means we have to sell for at least Sh132 per kilo to break even,” he said. Government’s subsidised unga sells for Sh90 per 2kg packet. Manager James Theuri said the factory has the capacity to mill, package and distribute maize flour to Garissa, Wajir and parts of Tana River counties if assured of a steady supply of maize. drop in the ocean A spot check by the Star showed the region receives subsidised maize and flour, but it is not enough. Ismail Gure, who runs a shop in Garissa town, said the government should consider subsidising further the maize supply to the region because of the extra transport costs of taking it to far-flung areas. Mohamed said, “What we currently receive is like a drop in the ocean. Our customers scramble for the subsidised maize flour the moment we stock and we are forced to ration to ensure that at least each one of them has something to take home.”
