Former Cabinet minister Nicholas Biwott will be buried on
Thursday at his Toot village home in Elgeyo Marakwet. Elders are
preparing to give him a hero's send-off. The elders, who met in Eldoret, said Biwott had
unmatched leadership qualities and as such would be buried with the highest respect
from his Keiyo community, which he served as MP for almost three decades. The elders, led by Benjamin Kattam,
Zadock Chepkieng, Moses Yator, Wilson Chesonok and Elijah Kosgey, together with
youth leader Paul Kibet, said burial arrangements are in progress. President Kenyatta and Deputy
President William Ruto will attend the burial. A memorial service will be held on Tuesday at the AIC Milimani in Nairobi and the body
flown home on Wednesday. “Biwott was a hero. We lost
a man we may never be able to replace in many generations to come,” Kibet said. He said many lies have been told about Biwott. “For example, people say he would change
vehicles many times while travelling for security reasons, but that was not the
case,” Kibet said. He said Biwott only did so because of the many people who always wanted to see him. Kattam said three schools named after Biwott will be renovated and expanded in his honour. “He valued education and ran
the best bursary scheme when he was MP and through that many families in Keiyo benefitted
a lot. He has left a very strong legacy for our community,” he said. Elgeyo
Marakwet Governor Alex Tolgos said the county has lost an industrious person who made valuable
contribution to society. Earlier it had been indicated
that the body would be flown to the Eldoret Airstrip and then driven by road to
his home to give residents of Eldoret an opportunity to pay their last respects. This is, however, yet to be confirmed. Biwott had his private offices, and
several businesses and homes in Eldoret town where he operated from most of the
time.
