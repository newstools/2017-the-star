Rivatex East Africa has purchased new Sh3 billion machines in a bid to revamp its operations. This is from a Sh3 billion loan received from the Indian government through Exim Bank to help revive the cotton industry, which has declined due to low production among farmers.Indian High Commissioner to Kenya Suchitra Durai on Wednesday said the contract has been signed and the machines will be in the country any time now.Touring Busia last month, President Uhuru Kenyatta said the government will revive cotton farming through purchase of improved seeds to boost production of the crop.&ldquo;The government also plans to revive Kisumu Cotton Mills [Kicomi] and Mount Kenya Textile Mills [Mountex], which will be followed by the revival of ginneries. We want to reopen our textile factories and revive ginneries to support cotton farming,&rdquo; he said in Funyula, once known for its cotton production. The Kenya Tailoring and Textile Workers&rsquo; Union yesterday said that from the early 1990s, 87 textile factories have collapsed countrywide.In an interview with the Star, Fibre Crops Directorate interim head Anthony Mureithi said the current national seed cotton production is at 30,000 bales per year &mdash; far below the country&rsquo;s demand.&ldquo;Local cotton production only meets 17 per cent of local demand. To bridge the gap, the government imports substantial amounts of cotton lint and seed cake for local textile mills and feed manufacture &mdash; mainly from Tanzania and Uganda &mdash; which produce 15 times and five times Kenya&rsquo;s production yearly,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Cotton production peaked in 1984, with an output of 70,000 bales, but it has declined to 30,000 bales of lint cotton currently.&rdquo;Mureithi added that Kenya has the potential to produce 350,000 bales of lint from 741,316 acres under rain-fed agriculture and an additional 86,486 under irrigation, and that out of the total land suitable for cotton farming, only 74,131 acres is currently in use.He attributed the decline in cotton production to market liberalisation, competition from synthetic fibres, disease and pest buildup, especially the African bollworm and cotton strainers.
