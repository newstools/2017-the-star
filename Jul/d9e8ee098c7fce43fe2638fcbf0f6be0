She said it was crucial in the development of the county, and asked them to be ambassadors of the project.In her speech, the PS outlined key government initiatives in line with Lapsset. The project is beginning to take shape and is expected to begin operations once the first berths are complete next year.Maawy said the counties are beginning to embrace the transformation dream by coming up with spatial plans with key components of Lapsset. They include resort cities, roads and industrial parks.The Lamu spatial plan was launched on July 12 in Mkunguni Square at a function attended by the PS.Speaking to journalists during the public participation meeting called by Lapsset on Thursday, she said investors are keen on investing in Lamu because of the development.Maawy told them to make good use of their land and not sell it cheaply as its value is rising each day.The area earmarked for industrial development in Lamu county alone covers a stretch of 700 square kilometres.Maawy also showed the public some of the projects being implemented by the national government, as reflected in the Presidential delivery unit reports.They include the tarmacking of the 135-km Garsen Witu Lamu road at a cost of Sh10 billion. The PS said tarmacking will begin soon.Other key projects are, improvement to bitumen standard of Sh11 billion Mokowe township roads and upgrading of health facilities.She said Lapsset is bigger than the SGR, and once complete will enable Lamu to compete with Dubai, Amsterdam and Singapore.&ldquo;A port town never stops growing, Lapsset holds the future of the Lamu people. They shall get jobs,&rsquo;&rsquo; she said.The ships that will dock at Lamu port will be bigger than those in Mombasa.
