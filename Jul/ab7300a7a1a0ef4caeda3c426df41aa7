The East African Wildlife Society is trying to restore Lake Ol Bolossat, the only freshwater body in Central. The 43.3 square kilometre lake is threatened by unprecedented environmental degradation In a statement to newsrooms on Tuesday, EAWLS executive director Julius Kamau said a recent study found rampant pollution from urban effluent and farm chemicals. The lake is between the Aberdare Ranges and Dundori Ridge in Nyandarua county. Silting, pollution and encroachment are threatening the lake, an important habitat for birds and other wildlife, Kamau said. The lake supports a large population of people, livestock and wildlife downstream in the arid and semi-arid areas of Northern Kenya. It is the source of the Ewaso Nyiro River. threats galore The thriving tourism industry in Samburu, Shaba and Buffalo springs national reserves, for instance, is made possible by the river. Kamau warned the lake could dry up if measures to preserve it fail. The lake is home to many families of hippos and thousands of birds. It is designated Kenya’s 61st Important Bird Area, a refuge for the endangered grey crowned crane. Extensive damage to the lake has been caused by deforestation, over-fishing, overgrazing on the riparian areas, abstraction of water, hunting of water birds and erosion caused by quarrying and road repairs. “The threats have resulted in the introduction of invasive plant species — such as water fern from South America — receding water levels, disruption of hydrological balance, habitat loss, and human-wildlife conflicts,” Kamau said. “Adverse impacts of climate change have compounded the problem.”
