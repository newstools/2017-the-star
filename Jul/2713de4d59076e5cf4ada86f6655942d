Lamu Governor Issa Timamy (pictured) has warned residents against electing leaders who support land grabbing. He said the issue is sensitive and urged residents to vote in leaders who are willing to resolve land injustices. Timamy spoke while campaigning in Boko, Dide Waride, Moa and Chalaluma villages in Witu. He said his stand on land issues has earned him many political enemies who are out to frustrate his reelection bid.
