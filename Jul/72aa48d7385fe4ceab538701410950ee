Shooting novice, police constable Clifford Kiptarus yesterday made the a cut for the penultimate stage of the full-bore rifle competition ahead of Her Majesty the Queen’s Finals set for today at the Stickledown Range in London.
He is among six Kenyan sharpshooters who take to the firing line today to vie for positions in the top 100 to advance to compete for the prestigious Her Majesty the Queen’s Finals set for tomorrow at the ongoing UK Imperial Bisley meeting.
The international full-bore rifle shooting debutant carded 102 points, 11 vee-bulls out of a possible total of 105.21 to advance to the second stage after finishing in the top 200 trigger pullers out of 730.
This initial stage was fired at distance of 300m, 500m and 600m for 35.7 points in each range. He will be striving to be so accurate to garner maximum points to place in the top 100 for the finals tomorrow. Kiptarus is joined by Sergeant William Ahongo 104.11, inspector of police Simon Ndambuki 103.13, chief inspectors Nathan Mringie 103.12 and Peter Muli 102.14, and Sgt. Sanford Otundo 102.10.
Amongst the six, Otundo is the only marksman who has competed in the finals in 2013 when he settled for position 68 overall. Kenya’s best placement in HMS Queen’s finals was in 2009 when eight-time Kenya Open champion Major (retired) Peter Mathenge ranked 13th globally. In another shoot, three-time Kenya Open holder Christopher Saina and Ahongo qualified for the second stage of St. George’s Trophy today.  They downed 74.7 and 73.11 respectively to place in the top 200.
