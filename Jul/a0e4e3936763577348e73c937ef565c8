The National Cohesion and Integration Commission should probe Coast regional coordinator Nelson Marwa for alleging that politicians have been funding terrorists, Lamu leaders have said. They urged him to concentrate on security instead of issuing threats and divisive statements. Woman representative Shakilla Abdalla and politicians Rishad Amana and Hassan Albeity also want Marwa to retract his sentiments and apologise, as the allegations could trigger instability in the region. Speaking in Lamu on Tuesday, the two leaders said it was unwise and unthoughtful of Marwa to make such a statement at a time when attacks are rife in the county and it could make worse the fragile security. Earlier on in Lamu, Marwa said some politicians are funding al Shabaab militants. He said the recent terror attack in which Public Housing CS Mariam El Maawy was briefly taken hostage, shot and wounded by suspected al Shabaab militants was the handiwork of politicians. Five people died in the attack. Amana said, “The only thing he does well is to talk. While people are dying at the hands of terrorists, he will be busy calling a press conference and issuing empty threats to whoever. Marwa should get serious with his job.”
