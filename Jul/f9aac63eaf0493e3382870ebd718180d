The Sh40million nursery school feeding programme by Governor Martin Wambora has come under under sharp criticism, with opponents saying it is enriching a few individuals. Senator Lenny Kivuti and his running mate Emilio Kathuri said the programme under which the county provides more than 7,000 ECDE pupils with milk three days a week “has little benefit”. Kathuri said the programme benefits people  from outside the county who supply milk to the processing and packaging factories contracted by the county. He also questioned the timing of the programme at a time when Kenya is heading for the election, adding that it is a misplaced priority. “The county should have embarked on empowering local farmers to enable them to produce more milk  to satisfy the local needs  and for export,” Kathuri said, criticising the Wambora administration for failing to put in place long-term plans to facilitate the building of a milk processing and packaging factory.
