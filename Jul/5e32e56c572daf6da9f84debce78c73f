World champions Germany secured a first Confederations Cup title after victory against Copa America winners Chile in Sunday's final in St Petersburg.Lars Stindl hit the first-half winner following a mistake by Marcelo Diaz.Chile's Arturo Vidal and Angelo Sagal both blazed over the bar in the closing stages.Germany's Timo Werner was elbowed by Gonzalo Jara, who escaped with a yellow card despite the use of the video assistant referee (VAR).Earlier, Adrien Silva scored an extra-time penalty as Portugal recovered from a goal down to beat Mexico 2-1 in the third-place play-off in Moscow.Luis Neto bundled into his own net to hand Mexico the lead, but Pepe stabbed home a stoppage-time equaliser to force an extra 30 minutes at Spartak Stadium.Germany's future brighter than everHaving seen their team win the European Under-21 Championship in Poland on Friday, Germany's fans can celebrate another impressive tournament victory 12 months before they launch the defence of their world title.Their success in Russia has been achieved without a number of players who helped beat Argentina in Rio three years ago to be crowned world champions.Goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, midfielders Mesut Ozil and Toni Kroos, and forward Thomas Muller have been rested before next summer's World Cup.That has allowed a new generation to come to the fore.Midfielder Leon Goretzka, 22, has excelled while 21-year-old forward Werner has also shown he has a bright international future ahead of him.It was Werner who seized on a moment of madness by Diaz to create the goal. The Chilean gave away possession on the edge of his own penalty area, allowing the RB Leipzig forward to square the ball for Stindl to tap home.Germany should have doubled their lead before the break after another error. Jara's lapse in concentration let in Goretzka but Claudio Bravo did well to spread his frame and block.Chile's thoughts turn to World Cup qualificationChile had 22 shots during a high-quality final yet failed to find the net and must now turn their thoughts to ensuring they return to Russia next summer.Despite back-to-back Copa America successes, they are by no means assured of a place at the World Cup.They sit fourth in their qualifying group and have work to do in the last four games to ensure they do not miss out.Chile will have to cut out mistakes at the back and improve their poor finishing.
