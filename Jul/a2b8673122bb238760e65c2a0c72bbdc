Kenyans who have lost their ID cards have been urged to report to the nearest registration bureau to have them replaced, so that they are eligible to vote next month.Interior PS Karanja Kibicho yesterday assured that the government will fast-track the process to ensure no one is locked out. The PS said chiefs and assistant chiefs will ensure new IDs reach their owners once they are ready.National Registration Bureau director Julius Kimotho said the IDs will be processed at the same pace, and no region will be favoured so that all voters elect candidates of their choice &ndash; from MCA to president.NASA presidential flagbearer Raila Odinga, his running mate Kalonzo Musyoka, co-principals Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula and Isaac Rutto, and NASA national campaign chairman have accused the Jubilee government of influencing the registration bureau to delay ID cards in areas perceived to be NASA strongholds.Political analysts say the August polls will be a close contest between Jubilee and NASA, and voter turnout will determine the winner. Kimotho assured Kenyans the replacement is aboveboard, saying the mandate of his office is to process ID cards once applicants fill the necessary forms and submit them to the registration offices.Kibicho and Kimotho spoke at a Sagana hotel.Raila has alleged a rigging plot by Jubilee, saying the party wants to retain power by all means. NASA will set up a parallel tallying centre, supported by Tanzania and Germany, to avoid theft of votes.NASA co-principals have also claimed Jubilee plans to use police officers as polling agents to aide rigging. President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto have denied the claims.
