The battle for West Pokot governor has intensified after John Lonyangapuo (pictured) launched his manifesto on Friday at Chelang’a Gardens in Makutano town. The launch was attended by Kanu brigade leaders, led by chairman Gideon Moi and secretary general Nick Salat. They accused Jubilee of being corrupt and not doing anything to help the marginalised regions. The leaders urged the residents to elect Lonyangapuo as their governor since he will uplift living standards and ensure peaceful coexistence among communities in the North Rift. Moi also announced that he will vie for the presidency in 2022. “People of Baringo have assured me of their support. I also urge you to support me come 2022 so that we can bring leadership back home,” he said.
