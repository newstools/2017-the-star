Dennis Oliech was and still is Kenya's football darling, but of late, he has been bedevilled by financial problems. He seems to have sunk to a new low, as the most recent rumour has it he's been thrown out of his Valley Arcade apartment due to "non-payment of rent".Our source told Word Is: "Last week, a lorry came by to shuttle off his belongings from the house. He did not carry everything, just bits of it."Oliech lived in the East Wing of the Trident Heights, where the rent is Sh150,000 per month.A spot check by the Word Is team verified that indeed, Oliech had shifted from the house, but his "belongings are still in 5 East servants' quarters, and there were fundis in the house painting and performing repairs for the next tenant".Numerous calls to the football star went unanswered. A WhatsApp message was also not responded to. We only got blue-ticked in return to our request for comment.At the height of his football career, the star was known for his jet-setting lifestyle, where he would hang out with the reggae and ragga top stars in Kingston, Jamaica. When he was back here at home, he was everyone's pal, and he would throw endless rounds of drinks for his boys.He was the life of the party.The source said: "Oliech had a house, remember the one he bought when he was playing in France? The Cedar Valley house? Well, he sold it at below market value for Sh26 million, to an aspiring woman representative who was trounced at the nomination stage."Adding: "The Cedar Valley house was where Oliech used to live before moving to a three bedroomed house on Siaya Road, then later he moved to Kileleshwa Heights, early last year."
