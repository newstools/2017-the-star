The IEBC yesterday said it plans a full-scale test-run of the poll technology three days to the Election Day.NASA has demanded the IEBC tests the technology it will deploy to ensure it works perfectly.The IEBC procured the Kenya Integrated Election Management System, which it says is foolproof against all forms of manipulation to guarantee free, fair and credible polls.Yesterday, IEBC commissioner Roselyne Akombe told the Star the commission has been silently testing the technology to confirm its effectiveness.&ldquo;We keep testing our technology all the time. Final tests will be done two to three days to the Election Day,&rdquo; she said.NASA has maintained there must be live testing, stress testing and remote testing, in a real environment, of all 45,000 new kits.Under the election laws, the IEBC should have tested the system 60 days to the polls, but that did not happen because of the court-plagued procurement process.On June 9, the IEBC did what it said was a test-run, but NASA dismissed the exercise as a demonstration that fell below standards.NASA wants the electoral agency to test both the Electronic Voter Identification Devices and the Results Transmission System before polling day.But the IEBC believes it achieved much success when the Biometric Voter Registration kits functioned effectively without a hitch during voter verification.On Tuesday, religious leaders piled pressure on the Wafula Chebukati-led commission to thoroughly test the election systems and gadgets to ensure credibility.&ldquo;We want the IEBC to assure the nation they are prepared for the election, and in particular, whether they will test the election equipment, especially rural areas, where there is no electricity,&rdquo; Evangelical Alliance of Kenya chairman Bishop Mark Kariuki said.The IEBC yesterday said it will dispatch ballot papers to constituency offices three days to the polls for security reasons.Unlike past elections when ballots were distributed to regional warehouses, this time it will be carried out from the main warehouse in Nairobi.
