NASA flag bearer Raila Odinga is getting too old so he should retire honourably from politics, Rift Valley Jubilee leaders who lost the nominations said on Saturday.Led by Baringo Governor Benjamin Cheboi, they lashed out at the Opposition chief saying he doesn't deserve a chance to lead Kenya."He doesn't have manifestos better than President Uhuru Kenyatta's so he cannot take this country to the next level as he claims," Cheboi told a rally in Kabarnet on Saturday.Raila and his running mate Kalonzo Musyoka launched their manifesto a day before President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto did.They have criticised each other on the content of the documents in campaigns across the country.Read: Jubilee manifesto surpasses NASA's dreams, Uhuru says in Tharaka NithiAlso read: NASA reacts to Jubilee manifesto, says UhuRuto offers nothing newThe politicians under the UhuRuto Express Team want Uhuru and Deputy President William Ruto to rule for another five years.Their caravan began at Eldama-Ravine and ended at Kabarnet High school grounds.

They did not manage to convince voters so why are they speaking on behalf of Jubilee?" wrote Beatrice Chepkong'a.Kampun Lochenia said the politicians should remove the specks in their eyes before looking at Raila's.
