Universities unions presented a petition over the partial payment of sums in their CBA when the strike entered its fifth day on Thursday.The unions representing lecturers and staff in public universities have asked the Education ministry to respond by remitting the full amount agreed within seven days.UASU secretary general Constantine Wasonga said half the payment was made without consulting union officials."The CBA states that if a party wants to renegotiate, it ought to involve its social partner one month before. It was wrong for them to wait until the last day to wire Sh4.7 billion," Wasonga said on Thursday.He noted the agreement's implementation was approved by the Salaries and Remuneration Commission after the National Treasury and Education ministry gave assurance on availability of funds.Read: Lecturers to decide accepting Sh4.8 billion state offer to end strikeKUSU secretary general Charles Mukhwaya dismissed IPUCCF's advert calling for university workers to accept the first installment, saying no one will dissuade them from demanding full implementation of the Collective Bargaining Agreement."The Inter-Public Universities' Councils Representative Forum must know we will no accept anything less. If you do not understand the contents of the CBA we signed, go and read it," he said.UASU chair Muga K'Olale said the strike will continue if the government fails to honour its part of the deal.The petition was presented by the Univesity of Academic Staff Union, Kenya University Staff Union and the Kenya Union of Domestic, Hotels, Educational Institutions Hospital and Allied Workers.In the pact signed in March, lecturers were to receive a 17.5 per cent pay rise, while workers allied to KUSU and KUDHEIHA were to receive a 24 per cent increment.
