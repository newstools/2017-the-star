Jubilee Party Mombasa interim chairman Matano Chengo has been told to retract a statement against President Uhuru Kenyatta or risk ejection from office.A group of officials, led by Chengo, had on Saturday threatened to withdraw their support for Uhuru if he did not give in to their demands to meet them by 1pm today.Chengo and his group have been branded moles, spoilers and self-seekers. JP governor nominee Suleiman Shahbal defended Chengo, saying his ultimatum was probably quoted out of context.He said if Chengo really did give an ultimatum, he is being disrespectful to the President.Abdisalam Kassim, a member of the presidential campaign team, Rajab Sumba, a former mayor and national coordinator of the Council of Elders, have defended Uhuru. They want Chengo out of office - even if it means physically removing him - if he does not apologise or leave voluntarily. Alternatively, he will be locked out of JP&rsquo;s Coast headquarters in Nyali.Chengo had said brokers from Nairobi and parts of the Coast have been interfering with Jubilee campaigns in the region, giving false information to Uhuru and Deputy President William Ruto.He said his team feels left out when &ldquo;foreigners&rdquo; flock to the county and drum up support for Uhuru without involving them.Women&rsquo;s League county chairperson Warda Ahmed, Kwale and Kilifi county chiefs Mohamed Kidzeru and John Mumba agreed with Chengo.Yesterday, Chengo said he was misquoted and only requested for a meeting with Uhuru. &ldquo;We said after 72 hours, we will reconvene and give a way forward, which would have included following Uhuru to Nairobi. We did not say we will withdraw our support,&rdquo; he said.Chengo said he will not heed calls by Kassim to resign. He referred to Kassim as a &ldquo;political reject&rdquo;.
