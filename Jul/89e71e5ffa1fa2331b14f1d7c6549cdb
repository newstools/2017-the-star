Homa Bay independent governor aspirant Oyugi Magwanga has claimed incumbent Cyprian Awiti is behind his missing name from the gazetted list of hopefuls.The list published on July 27 has only three candidates names for the governor seat - incumbent Cyprian Awiti (ODM), Luke Misama (independent) and Tom Otieno (Jubilee).Magwanga said Awiti colluded with IEBC officials to frustrate him.Awiti, through his communications director Juma Aluoch, denied having a hand in the MP&rsquo;s woes.Magwanga told the Star the governor&rsquo;s close allies had told him to his face that his name will not be gazetted despite being cleared by the poll&rsquo;s agency.The former Kasipul lawmaker was cleared by the IEBC last month.&ldquo;I suspect my opponent must have used some money to give tea leaves,&rdquo; Magwanga said on the phone.He added, &ldquo;The first person who started talking about this rubbish has been my opponent [Awiti] and has talked about it for a long time. How did he know that I was not going to be gazetted? They have used someone from the IEBC to do so.&rdquo;Aluoch told Magwanga to produce evidence.
