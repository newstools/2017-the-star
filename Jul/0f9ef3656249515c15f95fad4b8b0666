Caffeine has been found to help burn calories by boosting the release of oxytocin, the hormone responsible for appetite and metabolism.A study conducted by Prof Guo Zhang at the Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan China, found that mice given high doses of caffeine lost weight and ate less.Drinking coffee had previously been linked to weight loss, but the reasons remained a mystery.Coffee has already been widely accepted as a pre-workout drink not only as an energy stimulant, but also in accelerating fat loss.When consumed before exercise, it causes fat cells to be used as an energy source rather than glycogen.It has also been linked to increased performance. A study published in the British Journal of Sports Science found that participants who consumed coffee before running 1,500 metres on the treadmill completed their run 4.2 seconds faster than the control group.Experts from the recent study have suggested that the findings could lead to the creation of an anti-obesity caffeine pill.The effect of caffeine on both mice and humans is on adenosine, a molecule that plays a role in sleep and energy production.When the mice were dosed with caffeine, the adenosine receptors in the hypothalamus were blocked. The hypothalamus is the central regulator of energy balance in mammals.This resulted in the release of oxytocin from the mice&rsquo;s brain cells, reducing the levels of obesity.Prof Zhang said, &ldquo;Oxytocin is a critical mediator of the anti-obesity effect of caffeine.&ldquo;Hence, targeting adenosine receptors by caffeine or its derivatives could represent a relevant strategy to counteract obesity and related illnesses.&rdquo;The study also found that not only was the body weight of the mice reduced, but their glucose intolerance also improved.However, the doses used were very high &ndash; 60mg/kg which would be equivalent to 24-36 cups of coffee in a human, so more work would need to be done to turn it into an effective therapy. The results are promising, considering that 28 percent of men and 36 percent of women are at risk of obesity related diseases in Kenya.Professor Guo said, &ldquo;We found caffeine significantly reduced the food intakes and increased the wheel-running activities of diet-induced obese mice.&ldquo;Together, the results demonstrate caffeine treatment ameliorates obesity through both the reduction of food intake and the promotion of energy expenditure&rdquo;Coffee has also been found to prevent diseases as it contains a high amount of antioxidants, which protect against damage caused by free radicals.It has even been found to reduce the risk of hepatocellular cancer &ndash; the most common form of liver cancer.A study found that drinking a cup of caffeinated coffee a day was associated with a 20 per cent reduction in the risk of developing HCC.Two cups led to a 35 per cent reduction rate and five cups halved the risk of developing the cancer.Caffeine, which has been deemed safe for consumption in doses of up to 400mg per day, is the world&rsquo;s most widely consumed stimulant. Reports show it can boost daily energy expenditure by around five per cent.
