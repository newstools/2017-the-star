The European Union has donated the equivalent of Sh795 million to support cassava (pictured) farming and value addition, an NGO official has said. George Okeyo, head of programmes at Self Help Africa, on Tuesday said the EU has extended a grant of 6.5 million euros to support the project in seven counties. Okeyo said the five-year programme will improve food security and nutrition, create jobs and lift living standards of 28,000 smallholder farmers in Kisumu, Homa Bay, Migori, Siaya, Busia, Kitui and Kilifi counties. He spoke during a one-day forum at Madeya VIP hotel, Siaya county. Programme manager at the Ugunja Community Resource Centre said ‘orphaned’ crops such as millet, sorghum and sweet potatoes had long been neglected despite their nutritional value.
