Machakos woman representative candidate Rita Ndunge has condemned intimidation of non-Wiper contestants in the Ukambani region. Ndunge (pictured) on Saturday accused some Wiper candidates of resorting to intimidation and hooliganism against their opponents “after sensing defeat ahead of the August 8 election”. “I’m a courageous independent woman representative candidate in Machakos,” she said. Ndunge was addressing the press in Mlolongo town after she was booed by a rowdy crowd, which she said was receptive and “cheered me”. “Apparently, I managed to talk to the locals at the function due to public demand — nobody booed me,” she said, dismissing claims she was booed. “I’m appealing to residents to support my candidature. My opponents should desist from inciting the public against me by claiming I’m Wiper’s enemy,” she said. Election guidelines require that all candidates be given equal opportunities to campaign and woo voters.
