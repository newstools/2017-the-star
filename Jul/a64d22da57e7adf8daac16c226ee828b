Laikipia North MP Mathew Lempurkel claims all whites will be driven out of Kenya should NASA flag bearer Raila win the August 8 general election.In remarks that have been seen as incitement, the Laikipia North MP said they will ensure all foreigners leave and that their land is seized."When Raila takes this leadership we will make sure all wazungus go to their homes," Lempurkel said.In June, Raila was accused of inciting violence by insinuating that big ranches in Laikipia are owned by foreigners who do not live in them.He denied the reports but a journalist at The Times of London who interviewed him said she quoted him accurately and asked him three times about the issue.Read: Raila denies calling for Laikipia big ranches to be 'rationalised'The MP further claimed a white man called him and told him to take his land."He told me, 'Lempurkel come and take this land because I no longer need it' and I told him 'just wait until Raila takes the presidency," he said."On August 8, things will fall apart for the Jubilee government."In a video seen by the Star on Friday, Lempurkel asks Morans to drive the Turkana and the Agikuyu out of power."Moran, please let us come together because Turkana and Kikuyu are coming to take our leadership. If they take our leadership we, as family of my mother, will be finished," he said.The legislator also said some people called him saying they will make sure he wins the election."Some people called me and told me that if I lose this election, they will leave Laikipia. I told them not to worry. I also told them if we win this election we will take this land," he said.He said asked residents to fight for their land as "Jubilee are animals...because it (the land) is ours and also let us fight for our cows. Make sure Nominated MP Sarah Lekorere goes home."He continued: "The son of Lempurkel does not fear anybody and any man that drinks the milk of Jubilee is nothing but useless."Lempurkel has denied claims of being behind raids on private ranches and other kinds of violence in Laikipia.He has been charged with incitement to violence and physically assaulting Lekorere.On Thursday, Lempurkel reported that his life is in danger and that he received a threat by SMS.He told journalist in Maralal town that the message was from an unregistered numbered and that the person behind it "wants my head".More on this: Someone wants my head, Lempurkel says, requests securityMUGIE RANCH UP IN FLAMESHours after the parliamentarian's remarks, Mugie ranch was invaded by thousands of cattle and gunmen.Sources at the ranch said coordinated mass invasions of Ole Naishu and Mugie ranches took place with thousands of cattle in vanguard.When questioned by police, Lempurkel said he does not care what he says.For more than four months, hundreds of pastoralists from Baringo, Isiolo and Samburu counties, moving with around 135,000 cattle, have invaded Laikipia.In March this year, an estimated 10,000 acres were set ablaze in Laikipia Nature Conservancy, the main suspects being invading herders.Two lodges at the ranch, which are owned by Italian-born Kuki Gallmann and host foreign and domestic tourists, were burned down.Last month Gallmann was shot in the stomach by armed raiders at her Conservancy in Laikipia.Read: Conservationist Kuki Gallmann shot by armed Laikipia raiders, airlifted to Nairobi
