An Eldoret cleric has urged the IEBC to be transparent in its work to avoid arousing suspicion among Kenyans ahead of next month&rsquo;s polls.Eldoret Catholic Diocese bishop Cornelius Korir asked the IEBC to build confidence among electoral stakeholders to assure Kenyans of free and fair polls.He said if the IEBC had provided the necessary information on the tender for printing ballot papers, it would have avoided the current lawsuit.Korir warned that suspicions may lead to rejection of results and plunge the country into electoral chaos similar to 2007-08.He spoke at the Sacred Heart Catholic Church in Iten, Elgeyo Marakwet, on Sunday. Korir called on Kenyans to maintain peace during the electioneering.&ldquo;We are urging Kenyans not to be swayed by political euphoria, but ensure they maintain peace and judge politicians based on their manifestos,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We as Christians should be role models in the promotion of peace and cohesiveness in the country by avoiding being lured into animosity.&rdquo;Korir (pictured) urged Christians to avoid being enticed with handouts from politicians to influence their voting, saying they should not compromise their convictions at the altar of money. He expressed concern that politicians are dishing out money to buy votes, instead of providing food for starving residents.&ldquo;I urge Kenyans to look at the bigger picture. We want politicians dishing out money to use the cash to buy food to starving Kenyans.&rdquo;
