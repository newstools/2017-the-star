Roadside food sellers and unlicensed water vendors have defied the Nairobi government&rsquo;s orders to close, following a number of cholera cases.The county on Saturday banned open-air cooking and ordered the closure of all eateries operating without food-handling certificates, to contain the spread of the disease. Some 336 cholera cases have been reported since May.&ldquo;First ask the big hotels to close, that&rsquo;s where cholera came from not here,&rdquo; roadside food seller Jenipher Kimondo in Baba Dogo, said.On June 22, more than 50 people were hospitalised with cholera after eating food served at Weston Hotel during a health conference. Treasury CS Henry Rotich and his Industrialist counterpart Adan Mohammed were among 30 people treated for cholera-like symptoms after they ate food at a trade event at the KICC last Wednesday.Kimondo said she has not received any communication from county officials who frequent her business.&ldquo;They come here every day, but they have never told me to close. Why should we close?&rdquo; she said.In Jericho and Bahati estates, water vendors are still selling the scarce commodity for as high as Sh80 per 20-litre jerrycan.Asked where they get it, a vendor said, &ldquo;We are supplied by water tankers that come here everyday. They say they buy from Nairobi Water.&rdquo;Since January many residents have been relying on vendors because of the shortage due to drought. They cannot ascertain the source or safety of the water they receive from the hawkers.Contaminated food and water are the major causes of the disease, which authorities say has killed three people. On Sunday, Health executive Bearnard Muia said county public health officers had started a crackdown on unlicensed food sellers and water hawkers.
