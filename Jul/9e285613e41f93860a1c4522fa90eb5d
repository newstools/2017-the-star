NASA has been opposed to the tender awarded to Al Ghurair, while Jubilee Party supports the tender and has accused the Opposition of trying to disrupt the General Election. Chebukati said the ruling was solely based on the reason that there was no public participation during the direct award of the tender to Al Ghurair. "We regret this decision given the urgency to prepare for free, fair and credible elections in the next 30 days. It is noteworthy that the High Court dismissed most of the allegations against the decision of the Commission to award the tender to Al Ghurair Printing and Publishing LLC." he said. He said the electoral body will seek further understanding to ensure there is no stalemate in the run-up to the general election adding that the judgement has far-reaching implications on the elections.
