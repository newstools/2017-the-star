Thirty years after it was inaugurated, the Moi Sports Centre at Kasarani is gearing up to host it&rsquo;s second international competition&mdash; World Under-18 athletics Championships after staging the All African Games in 1987.With the global youth show set to kick off in just a week, the stadium normally calm on week-days was a beehive of activity as casual labourers and engineers went about ensuring that the venue was ready to open up to the world on the July 12th .&ldquo;We have done the difficult task and what is remaining is cleaning up the venue as well as installing softwares which will be important for the comfort of everyone at the games. As it stands, our engineers who have been helping us set up the tartan have already booked their flights this Friday so it means by tomorrow, the job of laying the tartan at both the warm up track and the main stadium will be done,&rdquo; assured a beaming Local Organising Committee (LOC) chairman Mwangi Muthee.Security at the event has also been enhanced with eagle-eyed members of the dreaded paramilitary outfit GSU keeping sentry at various vantage points in the main stadium.Volunteers, who will be helping the participants during the two-week showpiece, were also being taken through their last training as they were being put up in teams to ensure they work in harmony when the competitors and their coaches start to arrive. Poland is already in the country and Sports Cabinet secretary, Hassan Wario conceded that some nations had already sent their athletes to Kenya for training. &ldquo;We are aware that some countries are already here though unofficially. Teams are expected to arrive officially on July 9 but we are ready at any moment to welcome and host them,&rdquo; said the Sports CS. The Kenyan athletes with the innocence of youth still etched in their faces are also toiling out to ensure they fly Kenyan&rsquo;s flag high during the event. They already have the blessings of the First Lady Margaret Kenyatta who visited them on Tuesday at the VIP Pavilion to offer them moral support on behalf of the country.
