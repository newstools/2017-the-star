Parents from Mavoko subcounty have been warmed against neglecting their children to follow politicians and attend their rallies for pay.Athi River deputy county commissioner Geoffrey Omoding (pictured) said most youths, women and men have become lazy and abandon their responsibilities, leading to increased child neglect.&ldquo;I wonder where politicians get locals to fill five to eight 60-seat buses in Athi River. They are always ferried to political rallies and events at weekdays,&rdquo; he said on Friday.&ldquo;The situation is serious. Some men, women and youths leave their houses as early as 8am and return at midnight daily in the name of running around politicians for handouts as little as Sh300.&rdquo;Omoding addressed the press after flagging off a peace walk organised by Wenami, a community organisation, at St Jude&rsquo;s Catholic Church in Athi River town.
