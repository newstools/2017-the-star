We have not held any meeting to agree on the party we will support," Nzili said.Speaking during a rally in Kinango on Thursday, he said although he supports Jubilee Party, teachers are free to back parties of their choice."The Teachers Union has to work with the government to realise its mandate and the the government had agreed to increase teachers&rsquo; salaries as agreed with the union," he said in Kwale at the meeting DP William Ruto attended.Sossion defended ODM's move on Wednesday saying he will continue representing the labour movement in the National Assembly.&ldquo;I shall carry the spirit of workers to the floor of the House. I will do this for the best interest of the Kenyan workers," he said."I applaud ODM party for nominating me and taking the interest of workers at heart."Read: Knut will not back any party during August 8 vote, says SossionThe SG said he will not resign despite ODM's nomination.He maintained will continue serving as secretary general and Trade Unions Congress of Kenya, which proposed his nomination, defended the decision.
