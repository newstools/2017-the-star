We know NASA is largely cartel-friendly," he said in a statement on Wednesday.Ng'eno further claimed the organisers - Debate Media Limited - agreed to extract revenue from advertising during the debates and share it among owners. DML consists of top TV media owners.He termed presidential debates a "cash crop to line up the coffers of an oppressive cartel"."This is why the cartel pleaded in court that they stood to earn Sh300 million from one debate . This is the only accountability question on the table," he said.DML earlier told a court they could lose Sh200 million advertising revenue should debates not take place and another Sh100 million investment.Director Wachira Waruru said this in response to a petition by presidential candidate Abduba Dida (Alliance for Real Change).Read: We'll not take part in presidential debate without Uhuru and Raila, says 'excluded' hopefulsNg'eno said: "The presidential debate was a matter of profit for owners of Debate Media. They agreed that they would claim rights to all presidential debates in Kenya."He added the "greed" by the media owners was a "text book definition of a cartel"."...anyone hoping to host a debate will be given total TV blackout. Cartels in every sector have paralysed the economy, denying Kenyans the benefits of economic growth by flexing the power of capital."Read: The problem with media-organised presidential debatesThe director also claimed cartels are now threatening to attack the Jubilee campaign."Their bias will grow even more monstrous as we approach the election. We are not afraid," he said."For the media to bandy accountability against a politician who endures endless blistering media coverage, just for choosing to skip a private function, is vulgar and disturbing."On Tuesday, Raila said he is ready to debate with Uhuru as part of preparations for the much awaited general election.Through his adviser Salim Lone, Raila told the President it is not too late to reach an agreement.He confirmed the Opposition's readiness to participate should Uhuru change his mind and asked him to reconsider.&ldquo;NASA is still ready to take part in the proposed debates as soon as Jubilee engages in agreeing on ground rules that the President used as excuse to duck,&rdquo; Lone said in a statement on Monday.But the President opted for a town hall meeting.More on this: I'm ready for presidential debate, Raila says, asks Uhuru to reconsiderAlso read: Uhuru to hold live Town Hall meeting instead of debate
