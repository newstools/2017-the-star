One secret that Wairimu Mwai insists let out to every bride, is to buy their wedding gown first and get that sorted, before engaging in other wedding razzmatazz.&ldquo;Women many times forget themselves while working hard to ensure everything else at their wedding runs seamlessly well,&rdquo; says Wairimu, proprietor of Sidai Brides.Wairimu, a career banker, has decided to go it alone in the business of high-end bridal gowns. Last year she opened a shop in Runda. She stocks designer gowns by Maggie Sottero, Rebecca Ingram and Sottero &amp; Midgley from the US.A Maggie Sottero gown ordinarily costs at least Sh100,000, depending the bride&rsquo;s budget. Wairimu orders the season&rsquo;s designs from the main shop in the US. Sidai Brides is the official distributor of the designer gowns in Eastern Africa and has clients ordering from as far as West Africa.&ldquo;The Kenyan wedding industry is quite vibrant. However, many brides with high taste and good spending power opt to go abroad to shop for their perfect wedding gown. This is the niche I am looking to invest in,&rdquo; she said in an interview.Wairimu was initially doing this business as a side hustle, but the need in the market has driven her to go full throttle. One of her biggest milestones is getting the right clients for her products. She says the people who come to the Runda shop mostly know they want to look good on their big day.Wairimu has had tough times, such as advising clients with a budget lower than the prices of gowns.&ldquo;It is the hardest thing to tell a bride sorry, your budget is lower than what the gown costs. I have learnt that it is only right to be honest with them, and advice them the best alternatives.&rdquo;Her weeklong trunk show, which will be happening from July6, is mainly meant to help create awareness in the country. Wairimu hopes to appeal to potential brides who will be directed to her shop to make orders. The show will be live on YouTube.
