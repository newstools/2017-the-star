Siaya residents should give President Uhuru Kenyatta a rousing welcome to the county when he visits on Thursday, but should not elect him on August 8, Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi has said. Uhuru postponed his previous visit due to what the county commissioner termed unavoidable circumstances. Wandayi told residents it is Uhuru’s democratic right to visit anywhere in the country in his hunt for votes. He spoke on Sunday in Rambula, Ugunja, during his campaign rally. Siaya is NASA Presidential flagbearer Raila Odinga’s home county and is perceived as an ODM stronghold. Wandayi told voters it is not a political offence to listen to Uhuru even if they do not subscribe to his politics.  No chaos, use energy to vote Those planning to cause violence should stay home and use that energy for voting, he said. “It will be of no meaning to heckle Uhuru in Siaya and you don’t turn out to vote. You will not have helped Raila and NASA,” Wandayi said. Earlier Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga also welcomed the President to campaign in the county. The governor promised he will put politics aside and welcome Uhuru as the head of state. The governor and MP’s sentiments are seen as promoting peaceful campaigns. However, the two leaders also said they have information that some independent candidates in Siaya are hatching plans to disrupt Uhuru’s tour. They said some politicians have paid youths to put on ODM T-shirts to cause chaos at the meeting and blame it on Raila. Such barbaric acts will be a breach of peace, they said. They urged security agencies to carry out investigations and bring perpetrators to book. The two called for peace and tolerance during the President’s tour and during campaigns and election.
