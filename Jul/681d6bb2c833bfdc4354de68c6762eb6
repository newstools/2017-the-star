Residents of Murera and Athi villages in Juja woke up on Wednesday morning to find their main source of water - the River Ruiru - had turned green from the discharge of raw effluent. The sludge is said to have originated from the Sh4.5 billion World Bank-funded Ruiru sewage treatment plant in the Gatongâ€™ora area. Residents expressed concern over a possible outbreak of an epidemic. Kiambu county authorities cautioned residents against using the water in its current state. Samples were taken to the Government Chemist for testing. County Water executive Esther Njuguna inspected the river and advised residents not to use the water for drinking or cooking. She said a meeting has been called with the Ruiru Juja Water and Sewarage Company management, Nema and her ministry to resolve the matter. Residents held a demonstration and blocked roads leading to Juja town. Parliamentary aspirant George Koimburi calmed the residents and called for the closure of the plant and a probe into its operations. The plant management was unavailable for comment.
