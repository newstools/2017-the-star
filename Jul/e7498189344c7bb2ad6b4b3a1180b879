The Kisii government has recruited 270 tutors to work in vocational training centres. The tutors appointed by the County Public Service Board have been hired
on permanent terms and deployed to the 65 VTCs effective July 1. Previously the tutors were hired by management committees through the national government grant programmes, which are no longer operational. “Vocational training is important to address unemployment as
graduates directly go into self-employment through self-reliance
initiatives," Governor James Ongwae said. "We have set aside resources to avail teaching and learning materials in VTCs for effective curriculum delivery.” He addressed the recruits at the Kisii Culture Centre. Vocational Training director Bulemi Bukhala said, “On average, we have deployed 4 tutors to each institution. They will
offer training to many youth graduating from primary and secondary
schools.”
