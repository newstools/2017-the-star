The Kisumu government has set up four cholera isolation centres after three people, including a prisoner, died after exhibiting cholera symptoms on Monday. Health executive Elizabeth Ogaja said cholera patients will be attended to at the centres. They include Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital, Port Florence Hospital, Rainbow at Otonglo and Kodiaga Prison. Ogaja said the nurses’ strike could worsen the situation if the disease is widespread. Speaking to journalists yesterday, Ogaja urged food vendors and residents to observe hygiene. “Operate within the law to prevent spread of the disease,” she said. Ogaja was with JOOTRH medical superintendent Juliana Otieno and Water executive Barack Abonyo. Ogaja said 23 prisoners and five residents were found with cholera and are admitted. She said samples of water in the prison were tested and found to be contaminated. “The water is not good for consumption due to its source, despite them using chlorine for treatment. We suspect the rationing is not effective,” Ogaja said. But on Tuesday, Nyanza regional Prisons commander Amos Misik denied that the prisoner who died on Monday had cholera. He said the inmate died from “totally unrelated causes” and had been sick for a while. Another prisoner was admitted with cholera, treated and discharged. Misik said 34 prisoners with similar symptoms were also treated and discharged. Measures have been taken to prevent infection by boiling drinking water and handling food with care.
