Kenya's most powerful man gave us a glimpse into his romantic life. For the first time, the President put politics aside and spoke about how he met the love of his life, who is the beloved First Lady Margaret Kenyatta. Responding to questions from Kenyans on Facebook, Uhuru was asked how he meet Maggie. The President said: "When I met her she wasn't the First Lady, she was just another wonderful, beautiful girl." He continued, "Her brother was my friend in high school. Through him, I managed to meet his younger sister and we started off a relationship that has lasted from high school till now, and I'm thankful to God for that." He went on to advise: "Who you meet today as a friend and a partner may be your First Lady tomorrow. The girl I met in high school is the First Lady...(laughs)."
