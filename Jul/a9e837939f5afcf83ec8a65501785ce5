Tycoon Bundotich Kiprop, popularly known as Buzeki, has urged residents to ignore Jubilee&rsquo;s call for six-piece voting and instead elect quality, independent leaders.Buzeki, an independent, is running for Uasin Gishu governor after losing the Jubilee primary to incumbent Jackson Mandago.A six-piece or straight ticket vote means voters only elect candidates from one party for the six positions. Buzeki said the straight vote is like an unattractive, bland suit that needs to be combined with different colours to make it appealing.&ldquo;That Jubilee suit will not be attractive in our county unless you add an independent colour,&rdquo; he said.Buzeki spoke on Thursday in Kaptagat, Uasin Gishu, during a tree planting.At the same function, residents shouted down some Jubilee leaders who were advocating the six-piece vote and urging them to ignore independents.
