Jubilee deputy governor candidate for Mombasa Ananiah Mwaboza has hit back at Governor Hassan Joho for likening the ruling party to a bus with a drunk driver and a thieving conductor, saying he has no moral authority to criticise leaders over alleged graft.Joho on Saturday in a NASA rally in Bomet likened Jubilee to a bus whose driver is a drunkard and the conductor a thief. He warned NASA supporters that such a bus would only end up in a crash.Mwaboza on Monday said Joho should first remove the log in his eye before pointing out the speck in another leader&rsquo;s eye.&ldquo;Charity begins at home. Let him clean his own house first,&rdquo; said Mwaboza on the phone.He accused Joho of failing to satisfactorily account for billions of shillings Mombasa has received from the national government and residents in revenue in the past four years.&ldquo;Instead, we have mountains of garbage in Mombasa. What has he done with the billions of shillings Mombasa residents pay in taxes to the county government?&rdquo; Mwaboza asked.He said Joho leads a county full of drug addicts because he has failed to rein in drug barons and peddlers.In February, Jubilee Mombasa governor candidate Suleiman Shahbal said 96,752 Mombasa residents are hooked to drugs.In his manifesto, Shahbal has prioritised the war on drugs, proposing capital punishment for drug lords.Joho has disputed this number, saying it has been inflated to portray Mombasa negatively under his leadership. He said the town is no longer a haven for drug barons and users.During the Eid Baraza on June 26, Joho and Mvita MP Abdulswamad Nassir called on Mombasa parents to take their children to rehabilitation centres and the two will sponsor for their treatment.They said drug addiction is the cause of insecurity in Mombasa, with Nassir saying the most affected are Muslim-dominated areas.&ldquo;Joho has failed to deliver on his 2013 manifesto and is now hiding behind the popularity of NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga,&rdquo; Mwaboza said.&ldquo;You can fool some people some of the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time. Let him go and rehearse his lyrics,&rdquo; said Mwaboza.He said Joho&rsquo;s backyard is in disarray, yet he is busy pretending to do national politics.&ldquo;Joho&rsquo;s going for national politics is like a giant standing on mosquito limbs,&rdquo; Mwaboza said.
