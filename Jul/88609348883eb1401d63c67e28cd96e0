Samburu cattle barons have been accused of orchestrating the invasion of ranches in Laikipia North by 13,000 cattle and armed herders on Monday.This was minutes after a peace meeting called by government officials did not go their way.The meeting took place at the Rumuruti DC's office. It brought together Samburu, Pokot, Maasai, Kalenjin, Kikuyu, Turkana herders; commercial ranchers and government officials.Among officials who attended were deputy county commissioner Benedict Munywoki and Major Stephen Mwangi of the Kenya Defence Forces.President Uhuru Kenyatta deployed the KDF to Laikipia to strengthen operations by reservists and police units against armed bandits.Read: Uhuru deploys KDF to flush out armed raiders in Baringo, Laikipia and MarakwetNotorious Samburu cattle baron Lenanyuki, who has been associated with most invasions of community and ranchland this year, demanded an end to all operations aimed at restoring law and order.In response, KDF officers said their orders were to respond robustly against those armed with illegal weapons because they are enemies of the state. They said operations will not cease until the problem of cattle invasions and vandalism is solved.Munywoki said private land owners have a right to protect their property from attacks and invasions.Pastoralists were told to get with the times and send their children to school to learn new professions."If they can learn to use the mobile phone they can learn anything," said one government official.Most elders at the meeting were in favour of security operations. The only ones against the operations were members of the Samburu and Pokot communities, whose leaders have been accused of driving the lawlessness.The meeting ended at 2.30pm and 30 minutes later, 13,000 cattle invaded ranches in northern Laikipia from all sides.Witnesses have repeatedly claimed the invasions are organised and sponsored by rich cattle barons and politicians such as Laikipia North MP Mathew Lempurkel, who boasts that if he wins in elections he will chase non-Samburu and Pokot landowners off their farms in the county.On Sunday, Samburu leaders requested an urgent meeting with President Uhuru Kenyatta on Laikipia grazing issues.They noted the matter has become a campaign tool for some unnamed politicians whom they said have been sabotaging their efforts to campaign for Uhuru.Read more: Leaders ask to meet Uhuru on Laikipia conflict, claim ranchers colluding with cops
