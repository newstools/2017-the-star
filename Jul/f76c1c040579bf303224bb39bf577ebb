Pupils, parents and teachers at Mathari Primary School, Mathare slums, received their newly constructed Sh170 million classrooms with songs and dances.Centum, in partnership with the county government and AVIC International, built 32 classrooms, ablution blocks, computer lab, a hall, kitchen, dining area and a perimeter wall.On Thursday, Centum chairman Chris Kirubi and CEO James Mworia handed over the facilities to Governor Evans Kidero and the school&rsquo;s management. He said they settled on the school after consultation with the county government and the area MCA George Ochola.&ldquo;This is like a dream come true to me. When we first came here in 2014, things were a mess. Classrooms were dilapidated, there was no fence and there was a big road passing in the middle of the school,&rdquo; Kirubi said. Kidero praised the firm for the gesture. He said the partnership is in line with his administration&rsquo;s plan to improve school infrastructure and improve the standard of education in the county. &ldquo;Quality education can only be achieved when the environment is child-friendly. A child-friendly is where there is effective teaching and learning, effective use of resources and child-centered learning,&rdquo; Kidero said. The governor said most of the 210 public primary schools in the city are dilapidated, and in some students study in congested classrooms.He appealed to well-wishers and international organizations to help him improve the school facilities.The governor said by so doing it will improve the quality of education and transition from primary to secondary schools.Kidero said the county has also partnered with other firms including Britam, KFW Development Bank and CARE Kenya to improve infrastructure in other schools in the county.
