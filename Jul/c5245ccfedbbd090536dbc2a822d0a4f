Kenya is likely to plunge into a constitutional crisis should the court cancel the printing of ballot papers awarded to Al Ghurair, Attorney General Githu Muigai (pictured) has warned.NASA wants the tender nullified. But Jubilee and the IEBC have opposed the petition.Muigai on Friday said cancelling the tender will automatically interfere with the election timelines, leading to the postponement of the August 8 election.If this happens, he said, a caretaker government will have to be put in place and this would be a recipe for chaos.Muigai spoke before Justices Joel Ngugi, George Odunga and John Mativo.There are 38 days left to the August 8 polls. NASA alleges that President Uhuru Kenyatta has links to the firm and intends to use it to rig the election.Pleading with a three-judge bench to reject the suit filed by NASA, the AG said interfering with the set timelines would throw the country &ldquo;into a constitutional crisis of profound and unprecedented manner&rdquo;.&ldquo;After August 8, if we do not have an election, Article 134 [of the Constitution] kicks in my lords. This automatically means the government will be completely hamstrung. In fact, the only functioning body will be the Judiciary.&rdquo;The AG said even if the court was to be persuaded by NASA that the IEBC erred by awarding the Dubai-based firm, the judges have the discretion of refusing to &ldquo;make such a radical measure&rdquo;.A ruling will be made on Friday next week.
