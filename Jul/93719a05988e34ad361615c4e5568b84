The US has confirmed that North Korea on Tuesday tested an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).Secretary of State Rex Tillerson called it a "new escalation of the threat" to the US and the world and warned that Washington "will never accept a nuclear-armed North Korea".Pyongyang earlier said it was its first successful intercontinental ballistic missile test.US officials believe the North may now be able to fire a missile to Alaska.However, experts say it cannot accurately hit a target.In response to the test over the Sea of Japan, the US and South Korea conducted a "combined [military] exercise to show our precision fire capability", Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White said in a statement.The US also asked for an urgent meeting of the UN Security Council to discuss the issue. A closed-door session of the 15-member body is expected later on Wednesday.In a statement, Tillerson said: "The United States strongly condemns North Korea's launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile."Testing an ICBM represents a new escalation of the threat to the United States, our allies and partners, the region, and the world."Tillerson stressed that "global action is required to stop a global threat".And he warned that any nation that provided economic or military benefits to the North or failed to fully implement UN Security Council resolution was "aiding and abetting a dangerous regime.The announcement on North Korea state television said the Hwasong-14 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) test was overseen by leader Kim Jong-un.It said the projectile had reached an altitude of 2,802km (1,731 miles) and flew 933km for 39 minutes before hitting a target in the sea.North Korea, it said, was now "a full-fledged nuclear power that has been possessed of the most powerful inter-continental ballistic rocket capable of hitting any part of the world".North Korea's official KCNA news agency later quoted Kim Jong-un as saying the test was a "gift" to the Americans on their independence day.The launch, the latest in a series of tests, was in defiance of a ban by the UN Security Council.But experts also believe that Pyongyang does not have the capacity to miniaturise a nuclear warhead that can fit onto such a missile.
