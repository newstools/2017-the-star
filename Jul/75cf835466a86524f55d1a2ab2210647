President Uhuru Kenyatta yesterday raided NASA co-principal Kalonzo Musyoka&rsquo;s Mwingi North home constituency in a vote-hunting spree. The President commissioned the Sh1.4 billion Phase Two of the Kiambere water pipeline project.Uhuru said the pipeline project will serve 150,000 residents of Mwingi North represented in Parliament by Kalonzo before the March 4, 2013 election. He said once the water project is complete, it will turn the area into a food basket, because farmers will produce surplus to sell to other regions.The President, who was speaking at Kyuso Primary School, was accompanied by Deputy President William Ruto. They addressed a roadside rally, with the vote hunt culminating in Kyuso Stadium, where a major campaign rally was held. Uhuru also commissioned the construction of the road from Kamuwongo market to Tseikuru &ndash; the home of Kalonzo.The President, who is running on the Jubilee ticket, told the crowd that unlike his competitors in NASA, he has proved to be a man of action.He said he is keen on initiating development programmes and will not engage in empty rhetoric. Uhuru added that leaders must be judged on account of their development, but not on public outbursts.He also took a swipe at the Raila Odinga-led NASA for promising to spend Sh20 billion to change the Constitution so that they can create jobs for the four other principals in the alliance. Uhuru said such a move amounts to wastage of public resources.The President pointed out that it was Raila who had pushed for the passing of the 2010 Constitution.He said the document, in its current form, is faultless and not even a comma needs to be added. Uhuru said Kenyans should be wary of hypocritical leaders.The President said if Sh1.4 billion could be used to provide water to 150,000 residents of Mwingi North, then Sh20 billion would be enough to initiate many more projects that will uplift lives of Kenyans.He urged residents of Mwingi North to support his reelection bid so that it gives him another opportunity to initiate more projects that will benefit them.The President expressed confidence that he will win in the August 8 General Election since he beat his competitors in 2013 when he and his deputy were facing crimes against humanity charges at the International Criminal Court at The Hague. The cases collapsed for lack of evidence.
