The August 8 General Election will be key in determining the political direction the Mijikenda will take in 2022, Kilifi governor hopeful Kazungu Kambi has said. The Kadu Asili candidate has been urging Coast residents to embrace the Coast-based party to have more bargaining power in national politics. Kadu Asili will field a Presidential candidate in 2022, Kambi said. But that depends on the party winning the Kilifi governor seat against ODM’s incumbent Amason Kingi and Jubilee’s Gideon Mung’aro. He spoke on Wednesday during campaigns. Coast has more than 1.7 million voters with the native Mijikenda accounting for more than one million votes. Kambi and Kilifi senator hopeful Lucas Maitha said despite the Mijikenda being the majority, the Coast has been dominated by parties from outside the region. They are ODM, Wiper and Jubilee.
