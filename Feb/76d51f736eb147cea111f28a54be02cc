THE government, through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, owes a duty of care for all Kenyans, especially those resident out of the country.That is why those Kenyans who are complaining about being abandoned by the MFA in times of trouble are justified. It is the sole responsibility of the MFA to ensure the good welfare of all Kenyans living abroad. It is supposed to follow up on any matter concerning such Kenyans and offer any support necessary that will facilitate their proper stay abroad.That 183 Kenyans are incarcerated in foreign jails is sad, particularly if the MFA has done nothing to help those involved.This failure by the Foreign Office means that the government has abdicated both its moral and legal duty to Kenyans abroad.We are not by any chance suggesting that the ministry should push for the release from jail of all Kenyans adjudged to have committed crimes abroad.The duty of the ministry in such cases is to take up the matter and ensure that in such difficult moments life is made bearable.The ministry should follow up on the matter and, where possible, offer legal representation to the victims, provide parental access or even open communication channels so that such suspects can communicate with their loved ones back home. But as it is, the MFA does nothing, as usually there are no contacts between it and such Kenyans.More often, some of the offences Kenyans are charged with are also criminal offences here. It is because of this that Kenya has signed extradition treaties with some countries.In such situations, there is a possibility that such Kenyans can be extradited and tried here, or, in the event of serving a sentence after conviction abroad, they can be returned home to complete their jail terms here.It is completely within the MFA&rsquo;s mandate to ensure this is done. The reason is that such Kenyans who fall into trouble while abroad should be placed in constant touch with their loved ones. It is also important because it brings people back home and assures them of parental care.The reason why the MFA has not done this for all those Kenyans suffering out there is hard to comprehend.There have been cases where the state has moved in to provide assistance. But this is in those cases where those involved belong to the powerful, dominant classes.
