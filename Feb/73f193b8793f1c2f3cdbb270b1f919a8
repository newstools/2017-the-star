Environment PS Charles Sunkuli yesterday accused the Nairobi government of laxity in waste management, a devolved function. &ldquo;There is raw effluent being discharged directly into the rivers, especially from Kawangware residential areas and other parts such as the women&rsquo;s prison centre in Lang&rsquo;ata. I urge the county government to ensure these places are connected to the main sewer lines to address the problem,&rdquo; Sunkuli said. He said the ministry is engaging the youth in clearing solid waste daily, but illegal dumping continues to hinder their efforts. Sunkuli said there is inadequate money to pay youths involved in solid waste management. &ldquo;We also face difficulties accessing riparian areas, where residents directly dump solid waste into the rivers,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;As a ministry, we need very strong support from the county, residents&rsquo; association and other government agencies.&rdquo;
