The Kenya Revenue Authority wants an interagency task force to recommend a regulation and a taxation regime for the gaming industry.Reacting to proposed legislation by MPs, the authority says the task force should come up with regulations after studying the industry .Two Bills aim to rein in the industry by making it more accountable through proper taxation.Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo has published the Betting, Lotteries and Gaming Bill, 2016. The Interior ministry, through the Betting Licensing Board, has drafted another bill. But the KRA wants a more diligent study of the sector by an expanded agency to include its officers, the BC&amp;LB, the Competition Authority of Kenya and the Central Bank of Kenya.KRA further wants the establishment of an autonomous Betting, Control and Licensing Authority, unlike the BC&amp;LB, which falls under the Interior ministry. The proposed mandate will be to come up with stringent measures to control the sector and establish an aggressive public awareness campaign.&ldquo;An aggressive market strategy must be put in place and public awareness campaigns intensified to to increase overall tax compliance,&rdquo; KRA says in a document tabled before the National Assembly Labour Committee.The committee chaired by Matungulu MP David Were yesterday denied admission to a team of KRA officers led by Benson Korongo. It also refused to accept the document, demanding that Commissioner General John Njiraini appear in person before the panel. Were said, &ldquo;We invited the commissioner general in person. You are no equal to him. Go and tell him that we want him here on Tuesday next week.&rdquo;
