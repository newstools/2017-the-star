Nomination panic is setting in, triggering a wave of party-hopping from big to small players.Incumbents and aspirants fear they won't get a fair shot and primaries will be rigged, despite repeated assertions by both opposition and Jubilee that they don't play favorites.Smaller outfits have started reaping a probable bumper harvest, less than two months to the IEBC nominations deadline.They are charging minimal fees and giving direct nominations to woo elected leaders and aspirants uneasy in the big outfits. Both Jubilee and Cord/NASA have pledged repeatedly not to award direct tickets, which make primaries pointless.By March 30, the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission will publish the names of all candidates in primaries.After publication, candidates are barred by law from hopping to another party.Primaries will be held between April 13 and April 26 &mdash; and that's the end of the road for losers.Most party hoppers say they won't stand a chance in bigger outfits and doubt primaries will not be free and fair.The biggest casualty has been President Uhuru Kenyatta's Jubilee Party, which was formed through the contentious merger of 14 political entities. And it hasn't been an easy marriage, there's lots of squabbling over positions.However, former Prime Minister Raila Odinga's ODM has also taken hits, losing its people to both its Cord partners and to Jubilee.Last year the Jubilee Party reaped big &mdash; or initially seemed to &mdash; as it was launched in September. About 30 MPs and four governors, decamped to Tuko Pamoja.However, JP is facing major trials in its backyards of Central Kenya and Rift Valley.In the past few days, key Mt Kenya figures have hopped from JP to the Party of National Unity and Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua's Maendeleo Chap Chap.As most parties in the region folded into the Jubilee embrace, aspirants uneasy with the nominations process have jumped.In Rift Valley, Kanu and Chama Cha Mashinani are likely to benefit the most, as they plan to field candidates in all positions.PNU and MCC say they will support Uhuru's re-election, forcing JP to enter into deals to ensure it retains its Parliamentary majority.Kanu and CCM are yet to declare their choice for President, but they are expected to back Uhuru.The two parties are, however, among those welcoming defectors from JP after Deputy President William Ruto's URP folded last year.Yesterday, MCC leader Mutua received Embu Senator Lenny Kivuti who dumped Jubilee.Kivuti raised the same issues expressed by other defectors &mdash; they do not anticipate free and fair nominations and they joined Mutua's party as it supports Uhuru."I decided after consulting 1,200 grassroots leaders at my Kanyuambora home on Sunday," he said.Kivuti was with running mate former Manyatta MP Emilio Kathuri, Deputy Governor Dorothy Nditi who is running for woman representative and Mbeere North MP Muriuki Njagagua.More than 10 MCAs and aspirants for Parliament and county seats met at MCC headquarters on Monday.Another Embu governor aspirant, former Transport Permanent Secretary Cyrus Njiru, also ditched Jubilee Party for PNU.This leaves Runyenjes MP Cecily Mbarire and Governor Martin Wambora to fight for the JP ticket.Uhuru's education adviser, former Tigania West MP Kilemi Mwiria, also defected from Jubilee to MCC.Mwiria, running for Meru governor, said his opponents in the ruling coalition had crowded the field."My supporters have doubts about the party (JP) and asked me to make sure I'm on the ballot," he told the media in Nairobi on Thursday last week.Mwiria lost in 2013 to Peter Munya, who will seek reelection on a PNU ticket after refusing to join Jubilee.This leaves Senator Kiraitu Murungi, an architect of the JP merger, and Mwenda Mbijiwe to fight over the ruling party's ticket.Other Mt Kenya governor hopefuls, some sitting and aspiring MCAs and MPs, are also seeking PNU tickets.On Saturday, Baringo Senator Gideon Moi, who is Kanu national chairman, welcomed Jubilee defector and Mogotio hopeful Noah Chepkech into the former ruling party.The opposition, especially ODM, has lost a number of elected leaders to Jubilee but is not immune to the sweep by small parties.Last month, Ugenya MP David Ochieng was the latest to exit ODM for the Movement for Democratic Growth. He said he will not beg for the Orange party ticket because he has&ldquo;mastered the rules of the game&rdquo; and can play it himself. "I have done so much for my people but the party does not recognise my efforts... it views me as a Jubilee mole," he said.Two days ago, Kisauni MP hopeful Ali Mbogo dumped ODM for Wiper, becoming the second high-profile figure to quit the Orange party in a week.Mbogo said the Mombasa's ODM leadership lacks democracy and &ldquo;is keen on denying me the ticket in favour of incumbent Rashid Bedzimba&rdquo;.&ldquo;We tried consulting, but it became impossible. So there was no use wasting time there,&rdquo; he said.Former Heritage minister Suleiman Shakombo also abandoned ODM for Wiper to run for Likoni MP.He plans to mobilise support for Wiper&rsquo;s Hezron Awiti for Mombasa governor to &ldquo;punish&rdquo; Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho and other ODM members for &ldquo;mistreating&rdquo; him.Last year, former ODM secretary general Ababu Namwamba jilted ODM for the Labour Party of Kenya, which he has been selling countrywide.South Mugirango MP Manson Nyamweya, who wants to unseat Kisii Governor James Ongwae, has ditched ODM for the Kenya National Congress.Former Bonchari MP Charles Onyancha is among the ODM figures in Nyanza who quit to join the Kenya National Congress.The small Federal Party of Kenya also is making inroads in ODM's strongholds of Nyanza, Coast and Western.According to FPK general Kennedy Okello, the party has received nomination requests for 262 MCA tickets, 92 MPs, nine governors, eight senators and 14 woman representatives. Aspirants are from ODM and Jubilee.Those seeking the FPK ticket are mostly from Kilifi, Tana River, Migori, Homa Bay, Siaya, Kisumu, Kakamega, Busia, Bungoma, Trans Nzoia and Kirinyaga.
