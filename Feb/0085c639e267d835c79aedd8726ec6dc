MPs have ironically backed a bill set to clip Parliament&rsquo;s powers to approve the privatisation of state corporations.The Privatisation (Amendment) Bill sailed through to the Second Reading yesterday. Debate on the bill was concluded last Thursday, but the vote was deferred for lack of quorum. During the debate, MPs from both Jubilee and Cord accused the government of scheming to dilute their role in privatisation. However, the lawmakers on Tuesday approved the Bill sponsored by Majority leader Aden Duale, allowing it to move to the Third Reading. Yesterday opposition deputy whip Chris Wamalwa said MPs are hopeful the Bill will be amended during the Third Reading. The Bill gives the Cabinet the responsibility to approve privatisation proposals, taking it away from Parliament.
