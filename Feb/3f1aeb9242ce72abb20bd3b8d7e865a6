Everybody who is seeking an elective should sell their policies to the people because they the ones to decide at the end of the day," the Governor said.Ong'era said numbers will determine who the next president will be."The destiny of this country lies in your hands. It is good you utilise this opportunity to register as voters," the Senator said.Nominated Senator Janet Ong'era rides on a motorbike at Ogembo in Kisii during a voter registration campaign, February 9, 2017. /BENSON NYAGESIBA
