The DPP has one week to respond to an incriminating letter sent to him in the trial against former Foreign Affairs PS Thuita Mwangi over the controversial purchase of Kenya&rsquo;s embassy in Tokyo.High Court judge Hedwig Ong&rsquo;udi yesterday gave the DPP until March 1.The DPP&rsquo;s office is being questioned over unsubstantiated claims that suggested the trial was compromised, forcing a magistrate to withdraw.Tobiko&rsquo;s office has appealed against the acquittal of Mwangi, former charge d&rsquo;affaires at the embassy Allan Mburu and former deputy director of administration in the Foreign Affairs ministry Anthony Muchiri.The three were accused of graft in authorising payment in the Sh1.3 billion scandal and it emerged the building was bought at an inflated cost. Kenya lost Sh185.5 million in the purchase.
