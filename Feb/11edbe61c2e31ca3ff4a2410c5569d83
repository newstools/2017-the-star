Nyandarua Deputy Governor Mwangi Kirika has explained why he has not resigned the role, despite having been "side-lined and excluded almost completely" from running of Nyandarua government for the last four years. He said he abhors corruption and for him not to question corrupt undertakings, he has all along been kept at bay and denied information. Speaking at Ol, Kalou on Monday afternoon, Kirika said he has stayed since he is obliged to observe the constitution for the best interest of Nyandarua. As a lawyer, a critic and adherent of the constitution, he said, it is not lost on him that resigning would create a dangerous precedent. He said the deputy governor is there so that in the event of anything happening to the governor there will be no vacuum. "The governor may die, get crazy or be impeached. If there is no sitting deputy governor, it means the county would be subjected to a by-election ", he said Kirika said the law is clear a deputy governor cannot be appointed. He said that despite the difficulties he has gone through, the law demanded that he stay. "For that adherence to the constitution, with all the bitterness and suffering, I have persevered, and the people of Nyandarua need to understand it is because I want to comply with the constitution that I've stayed ",he said Nyandarua residents have been questioning why Kirika continue to stay in office, drawing his salary and never ceasing to complain. But he said he has not stayed for salary. "Even before I was elected to the county assembly, I was doing something. But it would be very dangerous for a county to be without a deputy governor ", he said End
