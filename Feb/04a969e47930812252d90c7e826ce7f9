Kiambu Governor William Kabogo has warned leaders forcing non-residents to register in their areas.Kabogo said the issue has been reported in Thika, where some traders at Madaraka Market in Kamenu ward who hail from Gatanga, Murang&rsquo;a county, were told to register in the area to be allowed to sell at the market.Speaking in Thika town on Monday, the governor said it is illegal for the market administration to intimidate the hawkers.&ldquo;This is undemocratic and a crime that should be dealt with accordingly. Kenyans have the right to vote where they deem fit to,&rdquo; Kabogo said. He urged the police to investigate. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m privy to information that it&rsquo;s the leaders using the hawkers to hunt for votes. But these are just the kicks of a dying horse,&rdquo; Kabogo said.
