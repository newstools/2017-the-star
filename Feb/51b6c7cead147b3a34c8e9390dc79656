The national government is broke and cannot honour the 2013 collective bargaining agreement signed with doctors, Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong has said.He said on Wednesday the government has been buying time in negotiating with the medics, instead of admitting it has no money. He blamed this for the health sector crisis.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m aware the salaries doctors demand are high. Talks with the medics can realise an amicable solution. Let&rsquo;s be reasonable enough to save the lives of our people,&rdquo; Ojaamong said.He spoke as he met 439 newly appointed ECDE teachers in Busia Polytechnic. Ojaamong described the CBA as an illegal document signed by a person not currently in government.He said governors are ready to hold talks with doctors so they can resume their duties. Ojaamong said doctors should have accepted the initial offer of Sh70,000 additional pay. The county boss said the focus must not only be on doctors&rsquo; pay. &ldquo;The other challenges at the health institutions, including inadequate equipment, should also be looked into,&rdquo; he said. He said doctors must also be able to deliver high-quality service. Ojaamong urged them to deliver excellence as soon as they resume duty.
