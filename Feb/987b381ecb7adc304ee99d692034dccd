When Thomas Nguli led the over 1,000 Makonde community and other stateless people from Kwale to State House, Nairobi, on October 2016, he had one thing in mind: to get recognised as Kenyan citizens.The walk, supported by the Kenya Human Rights Commission (KHRC) and other civil society organisations in Kwale, faced a lot of problems, from Coast regional coordinator Nelson Marwa trying to stop them, to forceful detention at the Voi police station.Nguli and his team were allowed to continue trekking to Nairobi. President Uhuru Kenyatta then heard their cry and apologised for the failure by other governments to register them.&ldquo;I am a very happy person, especially as a leader who has led this community, to see the government giving them IDs while I&rsquo;m alive. Most leaders in liberation die before they enjoy the fruits. I am very lucky,&rdquo; Nguli said.This was after Uhuru issued the Makonde community with 1,176 IDs, 1,731 birth certificates and 1,496 citizenship documents in Kwale on Wednesday.LONG OVERDUENguli says the achievement is the result of a long fight started by civil society organisations in Kwale county. These include the Catholic Peace and Justice Commission, Haki centre, KHRC, Kenya National Commission of Human Rights and Muhuri.&ldquo;We did not know the law and, therefore, the organisations educated us on our rights and how to ask for them,&rdquo; he said.Nguli said that without IDs, life was hell for them. They could not get government jobs or access money in banks, among other needs.When issuing the IDs, Uhuru said the Makonde community are no longer stateless people but Kenyans.&ldquo;We welcome you as a new tribe in Kenya and, therefore, let us unite, work together and develop our country. We have mobile Huduma centres where you can get NHIF cards and access health services like other Kenyans,&rdquo; the president said.He directed that they be given priority in the upcoming security officers&rsquo; recruitment in the spirit of affirmative action.&ldquo;Interior CS (Joseph Nkaissery) should make sure that this community gets enough slots in the recruitment for them to serve the country in all aspects,&rdquo; Uhuru said.Apart from jobs, the President directed that the Makonde community be included in the cash transfer fund beneficiary lists for elders and orphans.He said it is their duty to register as voters and ensure they vote for their preferred leaders in the forthcoming general election.The Makonde chairman said voting will be their secret decision, &ldquo;But you cannot tell me to help you if you did not help me,&rdquo; he said.KEY TO DEVELOPMENTFor Lupina Asmani, Lucy Sawaka, Beatrice Fundi and Zuena Fundi, getting the citizenship documents is a boost to their efforts to serve the country and contribute to development.&ldquo;This is what I was waiting for. I feel a very free person and promise to be a good citizen,&rdquo; Zuena said.An elderly and jovial Daudi Punda praised the Jubilee government for helping them get citizenship, saying they are going to walk free like other Kenyans, unlike before.Daudi said they will use the IDs for their families and developing the country as citizens.&ldquo;We are more than just happy. It feels like being freed from a jail term when I got this ID,&rdquo; said an elderly woman Lupina Asmani.She said voting for the first time in the country after decades of struggling to get the document is something she is eagerly waiting for in August this year.Youth representatives Beatrice Fundi and Zuena Fundi said their dreams have come true after Uhuru&rsquo;s intervention.&ldquo;Now we will be able to seek jobs that we could not get before in government offices like other Kenyans,&rdquo; Beatrice said.HISTORY OF THE MAKONDEThe presence of stateless people in Kenya can be traced back to 1936, according to Nguli.The Makonde community from Mozambique, Pemba community from Tanzania, Rwandese from Rwanda and Burundi have stayed in Kwale and some other parts of the Coast region for decades, without being given citizenship.Nguli said their parents came to Kenya after being recruited by European agents to work at their sisal and sugar plantations in Kilifi, Kwale and Taita counties.&ldquo;When they came here, no one went back. Instead, they intermarried and gave birth to us, and that is why we could not be identified as Kenyan, Mozambican or Tanzanian citizens,&rdquo; Nguli said.&ldquo;When (former President) Moi said foreigners should not take over jobs supposed to be done by Kenyans, our parents retreated to villages and started buying land to do farming.&rdquo; Nguli said that despite most of their parents having bought land in the Coast region, they remained without documents to claim ownership due to lack of IDs.Most of the stateless people, especially Makonde youths, specialise in carving sculptures, while the elders work in Kenyans&rsquo; farms to earn a living.Since 1987, Baraka Juma has been working as a shamba boy, after the then Ramisi Sugar Company was closed, where they were being paid Sh6 per day.&ldquo;Today we earn Sh2,500 per month by working at Kenyans&rsquo; farms because we cannot get government jobs. But it is a new dawn for us after getting IDs,&rdquo; he said.WORK, FOOD DISCRIMINATION Previously, Makonde women would be forced to rely on washing clothes for Kenyans at a low pay to feed their families because they could not get employed in organisations and companies around for lack of IDs.As a result, they were exploited by many people who used them as cheap labour. &ldquo;Most of us were forced to give our children to Kenyans to help them get birth certificates and IDs. They then become their children and, suppose they decided to remain with them, we could not dispute it, because we had no rights to claim them back,&rdquo; Amina Kassim said.She said before they got IDs, they were forced to eventually give up hotel jobs to locals because they were not allowed to work without documents.&ldquo;I gave birth to several children with a local in Kwale and he divorced me. I left with nothing because I had no legal documents to show I own anything,&rdquo; she said.Thomas Nguli said the community has faced a lot of difficulties, including being discriminated against during distribution of relief food.But for now he said they will be fully included and involved in development of the country like other Kenyans since they have IDs.HELP AT LASTThe cry of stateless people in Kwale to get IDs was heard by the county Legal and Justice Assembly Committee, chaired by Omar Boga, which wrote a petition to Uhuru through the Senate in September 2014.The President instructed the area registrar of persons in January 2015 to start identifying the stateless people in preparation for registration.About 1,570 stateless people were identified in Kwale alone, with the government estimating that there were about 3,000 to 4,000, although Nguli maintained they are more than 10,000.They mostly live in Kanana, Kinondo, Lunga Lunga, Mwangwei and Vanga areas.According to Boga, once the stateless people are registered, they will be able to access loans, participate in development and take part in this year&rsquo;s elections.&ldquo;We have grown in the hands of most of the stateless people and now we are leaders,&rdquo; said Boga, who also participated in the trek to State House.Domiano Gasias, 46, a father of four who carves sculptures to provide for his family, said they are exploited by middlemen because they lack IDs to get out of their working place and sell the products to tourists along the beach.Domiano mainly uses mango and neem trees for his sculptures, with the smallest being sold at Sh100, medium at Sh300, large at between Sh500 and Sh600, while extra-large goes for Sh1, 000.Bibo Nyambani, 52, also a Makonde, said they will continue with carving as they have no option.&ldquo;The Kenyan IDs will help us sell our items directly to the buyers. We feared being arrested since there were no documents to prove our nationality,&rdquo; he said.Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya praised members of the community for having remained peaceful and coexisting with other communities.Kwale human rights network coordinator George Jaramba said the issuing of IDs is not only the achievement of the Makonde but the civil society organisations who have been working with them to fight for their rights.&ldquo;After the Makonde are given IDs, we expect other stateless people to also be considered by the government and recognised as citizens,&ldquo; he said.
