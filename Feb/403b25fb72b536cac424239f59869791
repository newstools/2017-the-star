Knut boss Wilson Sossion has directed teachers to defy the TSC circular which requires them to teach on Saturday and Sunday.&ldquo;Boycott and defy such unprofessional circulars until union officials are properly consulted,&rdquo; he said.Sossion said the Teachers Service Commission directive is null and void as the union was not consulted.He was reacting to a February 2 circular released by Teachers&rsquo; Service Commission CEO Nancy Macharia which directed teachers to work on weekends.Sossion said teachers are not slaves and need time to rest and be with their families and go to church or other religious institutions.He made the comments in Mamboleo, Kisumu, where he launched the Sh26 million Kisumu Burial and Benevolent Fund Building.Sossion was with Knut deputy secretaries general Hesbon Otieno and Collins Oyuu and other union officials.The secretary general said no tutor should teach on weekends and only masters on duty should be in school on weekends.He dared the government to harass or intimidate union members over the circular, unless they want to face a nationwide strike.Sossion urged members not to vote for a government that intimidates workers instead of listening to their plights.He questioned why teachers only learned of the circulars from the Education ministry on social media.&ldquo;We must be professional. When did the commission start to communicate to teachers through social media?&rdquo; Sossion asked.The teachers&rsquo; union boss questioned the reforms being proposed by Education CS Fred Matiang&rsquo;i.&ldquo;Matiang&rsquo;i should tell Kenyans if he is a quality assurance officer or a minister because his actions are too dangerous for the nation,&rdquo; he said.Sossion accused the CS of doctoring results of the 2016 KCPE and KCSE exams and called for a forensic audit.The county TSC official was unavailable for comment. Her phone was switched off.
