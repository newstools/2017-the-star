This is likely to foster anarchy and break established order in society.&rdquo;Regarding police conduct, Oketch noted that the authority has strongly condemned unprofessional conduct and recommended that DPP Keriako Tobiko prosecute errant officers.Some of the officers have been charged, he noted.&ldquo;It defeats the purpose of police reforms when the public turn and commit the same offences they complain about when police commit them,&rdquo; said Oketch.He added that the authority has clear structures for receiving and investigating public and police complaints to professionalise the NPS.The spokesman urged the public to report any incidents to the authority.Human rights defenders have warned the National Assembly against "mischievous" miscellaneous amendments to the IPOA Act to trim its powers.The Act gives IPOA power to summon police officers for grilling and demand any document, information or other material held by police, if relevant to investigations.But Parliament has proposed drastic amendments that would deny the authority power to summon police officers for grilling.The proposed Bill also denies IPOA unlimited access to documents and items held by police or their facilities.Read more: Outrage at Parliament's attempt to trim IPOA's authority
