Lecturers yesterday denounced the use of &ldquo;paramilitary tactics&rdquo; by the government in some universities to intimidate them into calling off their strike.They said the use of security forces in an attempt to end the strike, which enters its 36th day today, undermines their right to picket as guaranteed under Article 41 of the Constitution.Their union, the University Academic Staff Union, wants Education CS Fred Matiang&rsquo;i to intervene and liaise with the Interior ministry to remove the security forces deployed in Garissa University College and Meru University of Science and Technology.&ldquo;University campuses are spaces of open inquiry, learning, research and innovation. All these cannot be achieved at gunpoint,&rdquo; UASU Multimedia University chapter leader Onesmus Mutio said.The dons spoke after holding peaceful demonstrations from the University of Nairobi to Jogoo House, where they presented their memorandum concerning the 2013-2017 CBA to Education ministry officials. They said their decision to reject the Sh10 billion offered by the government still stands.The lecturers said the amount was too little if shared among members of the three university unions &mdash; UASU, Kenya University Staff Union and Kenya Union of Domestic Hotels, Educational Institutions, Hospitals and Allied Workers. They said their demands are not only about salaries but also include non-financial issues.&ldquo;We gave out financial and non-financial obligations in our proposal. Quantifying everything into a lump sum figure is actually rude,&rdquo; UASU organising secretary Maloba Wekesa said.He cited research facilitation, poor working conditions and student mentorship as some of the non-financial aspects. Wekesa said most public universities, if not all, are understaffed and operate with below 70 per cent of the required number of lecturers.&ldquo;Every year, you hear a number of students being admitted to universities. But where is the commensurate increase of lecturers. Lots of us never go on leave, so working conditions are extremely stifling,&rdquo; he said.Wekesa said the Inter-Public Universities&rsquo; Consultative Council Forum has refused to table a counter-offer to their proposal because it has not been facilitated by the Treasury.He said, &ldquo;They should go back there [Treasury] and get something that can at least jump-start negotiations.&rdquo;
