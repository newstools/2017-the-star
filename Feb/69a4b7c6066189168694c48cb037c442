After Mukasa was caught and bowled by Dilkush Vekaria and Jay Mehta send back on a golden duck, Stray Lions lost wickets in regular intervals but managed to get to what looked like a huge total for the Nairobi West-based side.Sundar put on 30 with Neil Narvekar before he was bowled on 57 in the 14th over.Obado came in and despite losing Collins Obuya, he manged to score 42, thanks to an unbeaten stand of 48 for the seventh wicket with Harrison Ambani.In reply, Cutchi Leva were reduced to 1 for 2 after 1.1 overs before recovering to post 34 for 3 after 8.1 overs. But they slumped to 48 for 8, thanks to Obado and Chidambaran, who accounted for all the wickets that fell within the period.Dilkush Vekaria (11 not out) and Punit Jesani (7 not out) batted for four overs to deny Stray Lions the 10th wicket.On Saturday, Stray Lions bowled out sluggish Kongonis for 76 in 15.2 overs as latter made a disastrous return to Nairobi Club with an embarrassing seven-wicket defeat.Sundar top-scored with 32 as the leaders reached the target in 7.3 overs. Eugene Maneno topscored with 23 to emerge as one of the two batsmen to attain double figures. Hiren Varaiya, Obado, Subramanian and Sundar picked two wickets each to destroy the innings with five for 20.In reply, Sundar blasted 34 not out off 18 balls as Stray Lions raced to their target off just 7.2 overs.Paul Anjere&rsquo;s 13 wasn&rsquo;t able to stop the visitors from dominating as two wickets fell in quick succession to reduce them to 25 for 3. Anjere and Maneno went on to add 34 for the fourth wicket but after the dismissal of Anjere, Kongonis struggled and never recovered after being dismissed for 76.Despite the fall of wickets on one end, Maneno survived a torrid time to strike two sixes in his 17-ball stay at the crease. Sundar put on an opening stand of 36 runs with Mukasa before the latter was run out.
