Is Diamond a junkie?That seems to be the rumour doing the rounds in Kenya after word went round that Tanzanian police had summoned and subsequently arrested some top acts over claims that they were in a position to assist in investigations as they were druggies.I have no idea what is going on in Tanzania but it can't be a comfortable spot for artists right about now.&nbsp;So far the list of artistes who have been summoned and arrested include Wema Sepetu, Vanessa Mdee and her boyfriend Jux, &nbsp;Diamond Platnumz' own brother; Romy Jones who acts as his D, T .I.D and Babu wa Kitaa. And so now we have to look at the fact that rumours have been claiming that Diamond is amongst the artists who have either been summoned or arrested and I would like to tell you categorically that it isn't true.We spoke to Diamond's manager, Sallam Sharaff&nbsp; and he rubbished the list that has been making rounds online claiming that Diamond is a drug user. "The list making rounds is misleading because none of my artistes have been summoned by the police over the drug trafficking claims. Also those who have been summoned by the police have been called because they are users, not traffickers. If you look at that list making rounds, the P.O Box is fake. There is no address like that."
