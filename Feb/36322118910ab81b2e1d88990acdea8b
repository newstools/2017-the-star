Deputy governors will soon have their own council if a Bill before the Senate is passed.The Intergovernmental Relations Amendment Bill seeks to establish a Council of Deputy Governors and another for county assemblies. Currently, there is no forum for deputy governors and the assemblies. They meet through the informal Deputy Governors Forum. Narok Deputy Governor Evelyn Aruasa heads the forum.The Council of the County Assemblies would meet at least once every quarter and submit annual reports to the Senate, National Assembly and each of the 47 counties.The speaker of each of the 47 units, majority and minority leaders and one member elected by the MCAs will be members of the council.The Bill is sponsored by Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen. It proposes to expand membership of the National and County Government Coordinating Summit to include the Deputy President and all deputy governors. This would allow the deputy governors to sit at the same forum as their bosses.The Bill, which goes to the second reading, proposes governors and their deputies hold a joint meeting at least once a year.As with the Council of Governors, the chairperson and the vice chairperson will serve for a year and will be eligible for reelection for another year.The functions of the councils will include consultation and cooperation between the county assemblies, coordination and harmonisation of the operations of the assemblies, and aligning legislative priorities of the assemblies.The councils will facilitate the resolution of disputes between the national and county governments.They will discuss the counties&rsquo; performance, especially the execution of their functions and implementing their mandate.
