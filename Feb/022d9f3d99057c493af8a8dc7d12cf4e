Journalists working in Kitui are up in arms with the former Law Society of Kenya chairman Eric Mutua, accusing him of threatening and intimidating some of them.They staged a peaceful street march in Kitui town on Monday to express their disgust with Mutua.The journalists delivered a copy of a petition addressed to Media Council of Kenya to the office of county commissioner Boaz Cherutich.The petition signed by 12 journalists was also copied to the LSK, Kenya Human Rights Commission, IEBC and county commissioner. They said Mutua has launched successive defamation suits against five journalists to gag them.The journalists accused Mutua, who is vying for Mwingi Central MP, of using the court to escape public scrutiny. They urged the MCK to intervene and help uphold media freedom as enshrined in the Constitution.Mutua said writing a demand note to media houses after airing or publishing stories he considers injurious or defamatory is not intimidation and does not amount to threats. &ldquo;I am pursuing my rights and I have written many demand letters to the media in the past,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;I have personally launched a complaint with the media council over the erroneous reports from Kitui county journalists. If the MCK has gotten the journalists' petition, it will arbitrate and find out who is in the wrong.&rdquo; said Mutua as he reacted to the journalists&rsquo; petition.
