Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet has ordered all security camps set up in schools in the Linda Boni operation zones be moved elsewhere.Since 2014, the Basuba and Kiangwe Primary Schools in Lamu East have been used as regular police and GSU camps, because of their proximity to the operation zones.Despite the re-opening of Basuba, Milimani, Mangai, Mararani and Kiangwe Primary Schools, which were closed for over three years due to insecurity, the police continued to live within the school premises much to the dissatisfaction of the parents.During his recent tour of Lamu last Saturday, IG Boinnet ordered all camps in the two schools to be moved as soon as possible to create a convenient learning environment.On Monday, military tractors were seen clearing alternative sites where the police camps will be established . Parents in Basuba ward have commended the IG for his intervention, terming it timely and appropriate.Operation Linda Boni is intended to flush out al Shabaab from the forest.
