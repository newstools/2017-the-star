Kitui MPs have endorsed senator David Musila for the governor seat held by Julius Malombe.It had been said that Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka had been supportive of Malombe's re-election but Musila said on Wednesday that it was upon the party to pick him."This endorsement is not for Kalonzo to support me but a message for Kitui people to support me. I'm going to be a candidate regardless of the party," he said.He addressed the press flanked National Assembly Minority Leader Francis Nyenze and eight MPs.Malombe once criticised MPs for saying he will not be re-elected.He said Kitui people were wise and would reward him by re-electing him for his good work and equitable development across the county.More on this: Kitui people will reward me, Malombe tells MPAlso read: Kitui's Malombe hard to unseatMalombe&rsquo;s wife said her husband was the Kitui version of the Biblical Moses, who delivered the people of Israel from captivity in Egypt.Edith Mawia said just as Moses delivered the Israelites from slavery, Governor Malombe is keen on delivering the Kitui people from the yoke of underdevelopment, poverty and economic bondage.But Mawia said this will only happen if he is reelected for another five years. &ldquo;But just as it happened with Moses in the wilderness before the people of Israel reached the promised land, some misguided leaders have come out to undermine Malombe, even before he fully delivers on his promise to Kitui,&rdquo; she said.Read more: My husband is the Moses of Kitui, says Malombe&rsquo;s wife
