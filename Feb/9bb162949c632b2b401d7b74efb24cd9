Nyeri politics heightened last weekend when former Mathira MP Ephraim Maina declared interest for the senator race.During his manifesto launch at Kimathi in Nyeri on Saturday, Maina said he will vie for the seat on a Jubilee Party ticket.Maina vied for the same position in 2013 on a TNA ticket but lost to Mutahi Kagwe of Narc with a margin of more than 70,000 votes. He will now face other Nyeri prominent businessmen Daniel Wamahiu, Newton Muraya and Wambugu Nyamu in the party nominations scheduled for May.Many candidates have been waiting for Maina to announce his stand so they can also launch their campaigns since Maina&rsquo;s rival and Nyeri Governor Nderitu Gachagua also hails from Mathira.Maina said his decision followed consultation with the Nyeri electorate.
