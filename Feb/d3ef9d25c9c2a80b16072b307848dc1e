Online hotel booking company Jumia Travel has launched flight services for local and international travellers across the world.This development has coincided with the second forum of the Africa Aviation Summit, taking place in Kigali, Rwanda.The two-day conference brings together players and decision makers in the aviation industry, whose aim is to examine internal and external aspects, challenges and opportunities in the African Aviation space. &ldquo;Just like accommodation, transport is an integral component of the travel and tourism industry, and therefore acts as a boost to customer convenience to have both services under the same ecosystem,&rdquo; Jumia Travel CEO Paul Midy said.Some of the local airlines under Jumia Travel flights include Jambojet, Fly540, and Fastjet, while international freighters include Qatar Airways, Emirates, Air Arabia, andTurkish Airlines.African airlines include Kenya Airways, Air Seychelles, Ethiopian Airlines, South African Airways, and RwandAir Express.&ldquo;More than half of the continent&rsquo;s international arrivals, which stood at 58 million in 2016, are made via air transport, and therefore emphasises on the need for players to support growth and innovation in the sector,&rdquo; Midy said.Despite the potential in the continent&rsquo;s airspace, Africa only accounts for three per cent of the global air traffic. Annual passenger growth is, however, poised to grow by 5.1 per cent and cargo to 5.3 per cent by 2030.
