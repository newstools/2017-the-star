Kanu leaders led by chairman Gideon Moi have urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to take charge and end clashes in Rift Valley.&ldquo;It has reached a time when the President himself must take charge of the situation in Baringo and Elgeyo Marakwet,&rdquo; Gideon said.Deputy President William Ruto toured the two counties on Friday amidst fighting in which a chief was killed in Baringo North and 50 cows and 120 goats stolen in Marakwet East.Gideon urged Uhuru to act firmly and decisively. The violence has led to the deaths of 14 people in 10 days.He spoke during the launch of former Inspector General of Police David Kimaiyo&rsquo;s Senate campaign launch in Iten on Saturday.Gideon said the fighting, which has extended to Samburu and Trans Mara, is getting out of hand as senior Jubilee leaders continue with vote-hunting.&ldquo;This conflict can spiral into something uncontrollable. We want to see the enthusiasm exhibited by leaders when they were mobilising residents to register as voters,&rdquo; he said.
