The High Court yesterday extended the voter registration drive to Sunday but declined to order the IEBC to extend the listing to June .Justice Chacha Mwita said he has listened to the submissions from the IEBC, activist Okiya Omtatah and lobby group Bado Mapambano.He said although he is aware the electoral agency has a constitutional mandate of ensuring all potential voters are registered ahead of the August 8 general election, he is also aware of the implications in timelines of preparing for the election.&ldquo;To my mind, issues of determinations raised in this case are weighty and requires to be addressed by the court fully,&rdquo; the judge said&ldquo;The mass registration, which has been going on for the last one month shall be extended until February 19, after which it shall stand closed.&rdquo;The IEBC had pleaded with the court to lift the orders, arguing that extending the mass registration which was initially set to close on February 14, would have serious logistics and financial implications. The commission said the continuous voter registration will go on at the constituency level. &ldquo;Among serious issues for determination is whether voters can use passports and birth certificates. Without resolving these issues, the court will not be solving the issues raised," Justice Mwita said. But he said it would be in the interest of justice to give potential voters an opportunity to register.Omtatah had earlier pleaded with the court to extend the orders pending determination of the suit, saying it would be unconstitutional to deny hundreds of Kenyans who are yet to register.His argument was that the law states that such an exercise can only be closed two months prior to elections.His claims were, however, opposed by the IEBC. The electoral body urged the judge to vacate the interim orders and allow the case to go to full hearing. The IEBC through its legal and public affairs director Prexedes Toroye had argued the orders against it was an outright interference of the commissions mandate.Toroye said the law provides certain fixed timelines around which the entire of voter registration must be done and this cannot be extended without changing the law.The court also heard that the commission would be prejudiced as it has been spending Sh70 million every day and that would require it to spend money not budgeted for.
