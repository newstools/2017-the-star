Bungoma county is known for political bigwigs in history, among them Masinde Muliro, former Vice President Kijana Wamalwa, former Cabinet minister and UNCTAD secretary general Mukhisa Kituyi and Senator Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula.And given the calibre of these politicians, the race for governor is expected to be intensive.ASPIRANTS The race has attracted three aspirants,seeking to dethrone Governor Kenneth Lusaka, who will seek reelection on the Jubilee Party ticket. They are former Kanduyi MP and assistant minister Alfred Khang&rsquo;ati of ODM, businessman Wycliffe Wangamati of Ford Kenya and Consumers Federation of Kenya boss Stephen Mutoro. Lusaka faces an uphill task in defending his seat on the Jubilee ticket in a region largely seen as an opposition stronghold.The incumbent also faces criticism over unfulfilled promises and corruption, allegations he has on numerous occasions denied.The infamous Sh1 million Wheelbarrow Scandal, in which the county bought 10 barrows at Sh109,320 each is now the main political weapon that Lusaka&rsquo;s rivals are using against him. Four county officials have already been charged in relation to the case.LUSAKA&rsquo;&rsquo;S RECORDLusaka has, however, defended his administration, saying he has delivered on most of the promises he made, and those involved in graft have either been fired or charged.&ldquo;As governor, I have done my best &mdash; guided by the social, political and economic pillars of my pre-election pledges &mdash; to serve the people of Bungoma. These pillars sought to bring harmony in this county, which has in recent decades suffered intermittent instabilities such as the infamous Sabaot Land Defence Force conflict,&rdquo; Lusaka told the Star. He said he has ensured every community in the region is fully recognised and represented not only in his Cabinet, but also in all the other senior positions in the county.Lusaka says the economic pillar has benefitted to the people of Bungoma by improving their living standards.&ldquo;I have not only created employment for thousands of our youths, but also managed to create a conducive environment for businesses to operate in,&rdquo; the governor said .Lusaka pats himself on the back for improving roads and and putting up streetlights in all markets across the county.&ldquo;My government has also done a lot in infrastructure development. More than Sh1.1 billion has been used in gravelling (murraming) and tarmacking roads this year,&rdquo; Lusaka said.Among the road projects is the 40km Misikhu-Naitiri-Brigadier road that connects Bungoma to Kakamega and, by extension, the Uasin Gishu and Trans Nzoia counties.Lusaka said his government has supplied subsidised farm inputs to vulnerable farmers in all the subcounties.He said this year alone, they had reached 700 farmers across the 45 wards.&ldquo;The impact of this project is huge. It has increased food production and resulted in better earnings for our farmers,&rdquo; the county boss said.Lusaka, however, acknowledges it has not been easy because of resource constraints and corruption, propagated by some officials.&ldquo;We have tried our best to fix the loopholes some crooked officials use to steal public funds. We have fired those who are involved and called on the EACC to take up these cases,&rdquo; he said .The governor has been in a rush to launch new projects. In the last two weeks alone, he has opened roads worth Sh410 million in what analysts see as a campaign strategy.RIVALS&rsquo; ARGUMENTSWangamati accuses Lusaka of running corruption cartels, saying the Sh7 billion the county receives from the National Treasury cannot be felt at the grassroots.&ldquo;With the county receiving an average of Sh7 billion yearly, I assure you that Bungoma would not be the same. No road could be impassable here,&rdquo; Wangamati said.The businessman said if elected governor, he will run a corruption-free county by ensuring job opportunities are available to all without favour or discrimination.&ldquo;I will ensure every penny that is allocated to Bungoma is protected and used to improve the lives of our people,&rdquo; Wangamati said.He promised to increase bursary allocation from Sh47 million, which the county has set aside, to Sh1 billion to take care of the increasing needs. Khang&rsquo;ati argues he will use his experience &ldquo;to wipe out corruption cartels in the county&rdquo;.He said most of the tenders given to road contractors have been exaggerated, and that the people of Bungoma have not been getting value for their money.&ldquo;We will increase the local revenue collection, invest it in development and ensure residents get value for their money, unlike in the current administration,&rdquo; Khang&rsquo;ati said.Mutoro, who is the latest entrant, will battle it out with Wangamati for the Ford-K ticket. The Cofek boss is a harsh critic of all the other aspirants, including the incumbent, saying they are no different.&ldquo;I am the only person who represents change. All the rest represent the status quo,&rdquo; he told the Star.Mutoro said Bungoma has been ruined and needs a leader who is not tainted to change it. He said Lusaka has failed to consult residents in his development agenda, and whatever he refers to as his successes were misplaced priorities.&ldquo;It will be disastrous to replace Lusaka with some people who were named in the NYS scandal,&rdquo; he said.He said his agenda will be the war on corruption, infrastructure development, health and youth empowerment.REGIONAL POLITICSRegional politics will also take centre stage, bearing in mind the negotiated democracy arrangements used in 2013 &mdash; the Mabanga Accord. In the agreement, the governor seat was left to the Bukusus, while the deputy seat was preserved for the Sabaot community .Governor aspirants are now rushing to pick a running mate from the Sabaot in the Mt Elgon region, which largely votes as a bloc.The other factor is how the upper and lower regions will share the positions of governor and senator. In 2013, the upper region, known as Amutala produced the governor, while the lower region, referred as Sudi, gave the senator. Lusaka and Mutoro hail from the upper region, while Khang&rsquo;ati and Wangamati come from the lower Sudi part.Given Senator Wetang&rsquo;ula, a Cord principal, will stand for a position he is yet to announce, will also have some influence.His allies want him to vie for governor.Analysts say if he decides to vie for the county&rsquo;s top job, he will complicate matters for NASA&rsquo;s affiliate party aspirants.
