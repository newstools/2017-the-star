Kiambu Governor William Kabogo has said some leaders from Central have failed to register voters and instead engaged in unnecessary politics.He said on Sunday that some politicians were &ldquo;making reckless statements&rdquo; instead of mobilising registration, which ends today.Speaking at different stopovers in Kiambu during a registration campaign, the governor said these leaders are to blame if such leaders should be blamed for voter apathy in Kiambu.Kabogo said since the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission has failed to extend the deadline, everyone should ensure they do not live with a person who has not registered.President Uhuru Kenyatta is counting on Mt Kenya to vote for him in the August 8 election.Kabogo urged elected leaders and aspirants to burn the midnight oil and ensure all eligible voters have registered. He said county leaders should shelve their political interests and ensure unregistered ID card holders have acquired voters&rsquo; cards. Speaking at Kiambaa on Sunday, Kabogo said counties in Uhuru&rsquo;s strongholds do not expect to hear any other politics apart from voters mobilisation campaigns.
