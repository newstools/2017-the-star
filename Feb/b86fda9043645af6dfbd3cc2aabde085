EACC chairman Eliud Wabukala has been urged to overhaul the entire secretariat or he will fail in the war on graft. National Assembly minority leader Jakoyo Midiwo said his zeal to fight corruption will fade by December if he does not take action now. The MP spoke during a morning talk show on NTV. &ldquo;Wabukala should go into the office with a new secretariat if he wants to win the war on corruption,&rdquo; Midiwo said.
