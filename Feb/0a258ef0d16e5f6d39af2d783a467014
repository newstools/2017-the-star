Kenya Defence Forces men&rsquo;s volleyball team have welcomed the return of the centre player Gideon Tarus ahead of next month&rsquo;s Kenya Volleyball Federation league first leg at the Kamkunji grounds, Nyeri.Tarus, who is also a national team player, missed the whole of last season as after undergoing appendix surgery. KDF manager Alfred Ruto said the return of Tarus wouldn&rsquo;t have come at a right time as their objective is to reach the play-off slot and go for the title.&ldquo;Last season, we missed the services of Tarus and that might have contributed to our failure to qualify for the play-offs for the first time in a decade. I&rsquo;m happy the doctors have given him a clean bill of health and he is already training with the team,&rdquo; said the official.KDF succumbed 1-3 to Kenya Ports Authority in their last of match of the regular season in Laikipia last year and failed to book a ticket to the play-off with surprise package Nairobi Water making debut.The official is optimistic that with the presence of the Tarus alongside experienced Sila Makiso and Elisha Aliwa, both of whom have featured for the national team, and regulars Robert Kipyego and Gibert Tarus, they are destined for bigger things.&ldquo;It was saddening to miss the play-offs last season but the opportunity gave us time to ponder on what we might have done wrong and we are now set,&rdquo; observed RutoHe also revealed that they have signed four new players from secondary school to bolster the squad.The players include Cheptil duo of centre Michael Kiprono and setter Kimeli Kipchumba, left attacker Kelvin Aggrey (St. Mark&rsquo;s) and right attacker Samoei Kibet from Malava Boys.Commenting on the new signing, Ruto said, &ldquo;In this transfer and recruiting period, we are not going for experienced players but rather fresh blood from schools. The four were outstanding for their respective schools and that&rsquo;s why we have signed them.&rdquo;KDF will launch their title quest with a match against Forest Ranger on March 3 before they lock horns with Nairobi Prisons.
