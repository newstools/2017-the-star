Police arrested a man suspected to be a police imposter in Nakuru on Thursday and recovered a pistol and handcuffs. The man, identified as George Thiong’o, was 'working' in a private textile industry as a security officer. Two Mps from Nakuru want Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet and Police Service Commission chairman Johnstone Kavuludi, to probe the man who had been "harassing locals". The man was arrested as workers at the Bedi Investments Ltd, a company that deals with manufacturing of fabrics and garments, went on strike protesting harassment and poor working conditions. Nakuru Town West MP Samuel Arama said the man claimed to be a police officer but could not produce a police ID card. Arama and his Nakuru East counterpart David Gikaria were addressing workers at the company. “When I was trying to interrogate the 'police officer', he was unable to produce his police Identification Card and the situation worsened when his seniors led by Nakuru OCPD Joshua Omukata denied knowing him,” Arama said. “I can account for all my officers deployed and in this industry, I have not assigned anyone. I have reports of a man claiming to be an officer and he is armed with a pistol and handcuffs, investigations are on and the law will take its course,” OCPD Omukata said. "The Inspector General of Police and National Police service Commission chairman should launch an investigation on the issue which is a breach of security and also misuse of firearms," Gikaria said.
