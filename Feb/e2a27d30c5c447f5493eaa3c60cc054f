President Uhuru may have sanctioned the defection of Jubilee Senator Emma Mbura to Maendeleo Chap Chap, the Star has learned.According to sources, Uhuru asked Governor Alfred Mutua to "capture" Mbura before she made good her threat to move to NASA. At first Uhuru, through proxies, including Nairobi woman representative Rachel Shebesh, had tried to dissuade Mbura from jumping ship. But she declined, saying she would be denied the party ticket, whatever the nominations outcome.Mbura has expressed interest in running for Rabai MPs.She blamed Deputy President William Ruto and Kilifi North MP Gideon Munga&rsquo;ro for frustrating her.However, she chose to move to a Jubilee-friendly party on "advice from friends who groomed me in politics", she told the Star on Tuesday after she was officially received by Mutua in Rabai.The Star has learnt that Mutua called Mbura at around 10am on Tuesday, a day before she was to announce which party she would move to.&ldquo;The call lasted not more than 20 minutes. She then asked us to make impromptu arrangements for a gathering of about 700 because an important guest was coming. She didn&rsquo;t say who, but we later learnt it was Mutua,&rdquo; said a close Mbura ally.Mutua arrived at around 3pm and is said to have been surprised by the crowd, which numbered about 1,300, since it was an impromptu arrangement.Mbura has suggested Ruto does not want her to run for Rabai MP, after he "tried to endorse" former JAP chairman Nelson Dzuya and Amir Mwinyi. Ruto&rsquo;s camp is yet to respond.Rabai MCA Anthony Kenga of ODM has announced his interest in the seat. However, Mbura said she is confident she will floor all her opponents on August 8.&ldquo;They thought I would go to NASA so they can finish me [off] with propaganda. But they are all now surprised. I will still beat them,&rdquo; said Mbura.On Wednesday, she wrote to Uhuru, thanking her for grooming her politically and for his belief in women's leadership.&ldquo;It is out of this belief that you noticed my leadership capacity as a strong community mobiliser and personally took my hand to mentor me, mould me and build my leadership capacity to national status by nominating me to the Senate Assembly of Kenya to champion the interests of women in this country,&rdquo; wrote Mbura.She was nominated to the Senate through Uhuru's former party TNA.
