Marsabit county is now depending on the Kenya Red Cross Society as drought crisis gets out of hand.Governor Ukur Yatani has admitted the drought is now beyond their control.&ldquo;We have lost 60 per cent of livestock, which is a source of livelihood. Lives are now at risk because there is no food and water and also pasture for the cattle,&rdquo; Yatani said.He spoke at the Dukana area, North Horr Constituency on Wednesday last week when he supervised the destocking of over 1,000 goats and sheep. He was accompanied by Kenya Red Cross secretary general Abbas Gullet.Thousands of carcasses were scattered in the Dukana area.The governor said if the situation doesn't change, up to 90 per cent of the livestock could die, pushing thousands into abject poverty.Yatani said the county has done its best to cushion the residents. It has spent Sh500 million and has forthwith suspended all development projects so that they can raise an additional Sh450 million.Yatani thanked Gullet for intervening in the destocking, and requested him to offer more help.The governor said some of the 50 additional boreholes his administration sunk after ascending to power have dried, which has complicated matters.National government had promised to set up a fund under the Public Finance Management Act to find a long-term solution to the recurrent drought problem.The initial amount put in the fund was Sh2 billion.Yatani, however, said they are yet to receive the fund urging President Uhuru Kenyatta to intervene and ensure the money is dispersed to the region.The county boss said getting food from the national government to those in dire need remains an up hill task as because of poor coordination.Country wide,over two million Kenyans are without food ,with Marsabit hosting over 230,000.Gullet said the situation was getting worse in more and more counties but the Society does not have enough resources."We have been sending out appeals. Kenyans should be brother's keepers,"he said.Gullet said they plan to raise Sh 1 billion through the appeal,75 percent of which will go towards cash transfers.The other 20 percent(Sh200 million) will go towards destocking.During the destocking exercise,the beneficiaries who are mainly the vulnerable are first identified by the community.Goats and sheep are then brought in before being inspected by veterinary two officers stationed in Dukana abattoirAnd should they find the goat or sheep fit for consumption,details of the seller will be entered before the vendor who also comes from the community pay them Sh 2000.The seller who also qualifies to get meat will sign against his details before the animal is shoved to the slaughter house nearby through back door.As slaughtering goes on,a huge group of mainly old and weak men and women line up in the front door to be given meat.The whole meat is given to each beneficiary and advised to use their traditional knowledge and preserve them.
