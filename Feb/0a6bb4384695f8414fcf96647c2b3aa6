A Siaya private developer who accused Cord leader Raila Odinga of frustrating his business has been summoned over claims by Yala residents that he displaced them from their land.National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi yesterday ordered Dominion Farms CEO Calvin Burgess to appear before the Lands committee or face unspecified consequences. The team led by Tharaka MP Alex Mwiru complained Burgess has ignored it since 2015. He did not show up for a meeting planned for Wednesday.Burgess instead convened a press conference in Nairobi and requested Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery to deploy police at his Yala farm. He said Raila and his allies have threatened him with violence and eviction and demanded bribes. Burgess said the politicians have hired goons to threaten him.The 200 petitioners, led by Caleb Omondi Obonyo, say they were displaced from their 22,000 acres when the River Yala changed its course and by the subsequent development activities of the Lake Basin Development Authority and Dominion Farms Ltd.&ldquo;Invoke Article I25 of the Constitution, which allows MPs to invite anyone to appear before them,&rdquo; Muturi directed the committee. Mwiru said Burgess business licence is &ldquo;null and void.&rdquo; Igembe North MP Joseph M&rsquo;eruaki said it is absurd for &ldquo;selfish and corrupt&rdquo; foreigners to run multimillion-shilling agricultural projects but leave locals languishing in abject poverty. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s protect our country. Let&rsquo;s not be misused by the corrupt. Even if we are poor, we deserve our dignity,&rdquo; he said. Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo demanded Burgess&rsquo;s deportation to the US. &ldquo;He was chased from Ghana because of corruption. He has no interests of residents [at heart],&rdquo; he said.
