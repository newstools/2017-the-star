STARRING: Corey Hawkins, Miranda Otto, Anna Diop, Teddy Sears, Ashley ThomasGENRE: Action, Crime, DramaRELEASE DATE: February 5Three years after Jack Bauer has saved the world from terrorists in 24: Live Another Day, a young ex-army ranger, Eric Carter, finds himself on the terrorists&rsquo; most-wanted list. Carter enlists the help of the Counter Terrorism Unit to get the terrorists before they get to him. The show maintains the action and drama from its predecessor but somehow manages to fall short in shaping the characters&rsquo; profiles. Hawkins does a great job carrying the weight of the show as the main character, although he will always be compared to the immortalised Jack Bauer. Star Rating: 3.5
