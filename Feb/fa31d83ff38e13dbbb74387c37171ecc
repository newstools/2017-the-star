Kigumo MP Jamleck Kamau has castigated Murang'a Governor Mwangi wa Iria for lacking creativity and copying projects from other leaders.Jamleck said on Saturday that Wa Iria has no agenda for Murang'a county and has shown poor leadership."It is sad that the Governor, who people had voted for, has resorted copying key projects I have envisioned to help uplift Murang'a," he said.The MP said if Wa Iria values honesty, he should seek counsel from experienced leaders."I have never had personal differences with Wa Iria, what we have ideological conflicts where he thinks people need mirio (vines) and I think they need roads and an end to corruption," Jamleck said.He said Wa Iria only started implemented the promised listed in his manifesto in August last year when he (Jamleck) launched his bid to oust the Governor.Read: I am now ready to oust governor Wa Iria, MP Jamleck says"When I launched my manifesto, I promised to create a county endowment fund to offer bursaries and we all know the Governor has not offered this in the last four years. But this year, he has promised to help 100 students," Jamleck said.He said the Governor started implementing a plan to lower water tariffs, which was originally initiated by the MP."I just wish he would spend his last few months as Governor being more creative," Jamleck said.He challenged Wa Iria to copy from him accountability and openness in using the public resources of Murang'a."I have served as MP for ten years, over a year as minister and I do not have corruption related cases. I challenge Wa Iria to copy my pledge to help recover all Murang'a assets once I assume office," Jamleck added.The MP further cautioned residents against being duped by people traversing the county asking for names, ID numbers in the pretext that they are registering locals them into the Jubilee party."We have received reports that there are people who are collecting people's details and lying that they are registering them into the party. President Uhuru Kenyatta issued a public directive that issuing of Jubilee cards be suspended until IEBC voter registration ends and we should be wary so as not to sell our rights to participate in elections because of this," he said.Read: You are not welcome at my events, Jamleck tells Wairia
