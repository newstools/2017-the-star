Lamu Governor Issa Timamy yesterday urged residents to register as voters in large numbers as the IEBC listing deadline closes in.The final voter registration will end next Tuesday.Voter apathy has been recorded in many registration centres in Lamu.Lamu East subcounty is the worst-hit.&ldquo;This time round many people haven&rsquo;t turned up to register like in previous years. I think it&rsquo;s because people are tired of leaders making promises and never doing anything to keep them," Siyu resident Muhammed Shekuee said."We know they want us to register, but we don&rsquo;t really see the need. We would rather spend time doing something that will benefit our lives.&rdquo;But Timamy said registering as voters will enable residents to exercise their democratic right and elect good leaders.&ldquo;It will be a shame is someone gets locked out of such a life-changing exercise. People must know that your vote is the only gate pass to the future and the dreams we all want. Let's stop giving excuses and register to vote when the election come,&rdquo; he said.
