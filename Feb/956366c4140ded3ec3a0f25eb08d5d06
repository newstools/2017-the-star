The Nairobi government is committed to improving infrastructure to create a better business environment in the city, Governor Evans Kidero has said.Yesterday, he said the county is reviewing old by-laws that have affected businesses in the capital.Kidero spoke to the Kenya Association of Manufacturers in Industrial Area.&ldquo;Nairobi has been ranked one of the best cities in the world in terms of ease of doing business. And as a county we are working round the clock to attract more investors,&rdquo; he said.The governor also inspected roads in the area under construction.The manufactures had complained about poor business environment in Industrial Area.KAM chief executive Phyllis Wakiaga said poor roads, drainage and security hurt business.&ldquo;We are facing challenges especially when it rains because our trucks cannot pass,&rdquo; she said.Businessman Major Shah said they pay a lot of money for licences but get poor services.&ldquo;Compliance is a two-way traffic,&rdquo; he said.Businessman Arun Devani said the county has allowed the mushrooming of kiosks in the area, compromising security.&ldquo;There are shanties here, which make the city look dirty and untidy. The county needs to control them because this city belongs to all of us,&rdquo; he said.Devani said the Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company has been &ldquo;inflating&rdquo; water bills and harassing businesspeople who fail to pay on time.But Kidero said, &ldquo;I think you will be too economical with the truth if you say we have done nothing in the last four years.&rdquo;
