Al Shabaab militants stole BVR kits in their attack on Arabia police camp in Mandera East on Thursday.A senior security officer, who did not want to be named, said two of the weapons belonged to the AP and one to Kenya Police Reservists. The weapons were stolen from the strong room.Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery said the attackers also took a police Land Cruiser.Nkaissery said the militants overpowered 21 police officers forcing them to withdraw."We thank God no life was lost. We can't control al Shabaab but we can respond and ensure we defeat this enemy," he said."We are at war... these are things that happen in battle field."He spoke in a meeting with National Assembly Security and Administration committee over the ministry's 2016-17 Supplementary Budget estimates.Mandera MPs asked the CS and IG Joseph Boinnet to beef up security because the militants' threats are impeding mass voter registration."No voter registration is going on in Mandera and we fear elections will not be in the region," said Isaac Shabaan.Northeastern regional coordinator Mohamud Saleh said there was heavy exchange of fire between the officers and the terrorists.Saleh said no officer was killed or injured in the ambush at about 4am.&ldquo;Our gallant officers fought bravely. Kenyans should stop speculation especially when it comes to issues to do with security. Its is always good to have the facts,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;We should not be seen to be glorifying terror activities by giving them free publicity. We need to be patriotic and stop this habit of being in a rush to write things that we are not sure about."He added that the situation was under control and that more officers had been dispatched to the area. A 15-year old boy was injured by a stray bullet during the shootout at the post located 30km from Mandera town.The boy is said to have been sleeping in their house near the camp. He was taken to Mandera County Referral Hospital.The gunmen destroyed communication masts in the area, breaking link between police officers who were at the post and commanders.More info: Fate of officers unknown after al Shabaab attack police post in ManderaThe police post attack comes days after an ambush at KDF's base in Kulbiyow, Somalia, which left an unknown number of soldiers dead.Al Shabaab released photos of the attack in which it claimed it killed 66 soldiers.Read more: Kulbiyow deaths surpass KDF number, al Shabaab releases photos
