Doctors' officials have been taking instructions from "somewhere" to reject pay hikes offered by the government, Treasury CS Henry Rotich said yesterday.Rotich told a joint parliamentary committee inquiring into the doctors' petition on the disputed and unregistered June 2013 CBA that the government has been agreeing with union officials in meetings, but the medics backtrack and stall the negotiations by taking instructions from certain quarters after the meetings.Treasury CS told the National Assembly Health and Labour committees that the government is ready and willing implement up to 95 per cent of the doctors' demands to improve the health sector, but agreeing on their salaries has remained a stumbling block."During the Mombasa State House meeting with KMPDU officials, I was the chair during the negotiations. The officials were comfortable with 40 per cent government offer, but said they will talk with the National Governing Council,&rdquo; Rotich said.He added that, &ldquo;The officials were agreeable to the offer but when they went somewhere, they came back and said NEC has not accepted while insisting on the CBA yet we thought these are officials we should agree with in negotiation.&rdquo;Endebess MP Robert Pukose, also the Health Committee vice chairman, said the officials are taking instructions from Raila Odinga's NASA brigade to stall the negotiations."If you have agreed up to 95 per cent, then NASA should tell them to come and sign. They are listening to NASA," he said.But the seven officials of the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists' Union, led by secretary general Ouma Oluga and chairman Samuel Oroko, accused the government of not negotiating with &ldquo;utmost good faith&rdquo; to end the stalemate when they appeared before the committee on Wednesday.The strike that began on December 5 last year enters Day 81 today.They asked the joint committee co-chaired by Rachael Nyamai (Health) and David Were (Labour) to help resolve the strike that is in its third month and hold Health CS Cleopa Mailu and PS Nicholas Muraguri responsible for stalling the talks and for the loss of lives.&ldquo;Health ministry officials should be held accountable for the strike that has gone to 80 days because it is not a small thing. Parliament should also compel the government and the ministry to stop propaganda and scuttling talks,&rdquo; KMPDU treasurer Daisy Korir said.Rotich assured the committee that the government is ready to implement agreeable 95 per cent of medics&rsquo; demands if officials accept to sign, resume duties and finalise the negotiations that could lead into a new CBA for registration.He maintained Kenyans recognised the importance of the Salaries and Remuneration Commission to harmonise earnings of public servants and doctors&rsquo; salaries cannot be reviewed outside SRC&rsquo;s constitutional mandate.&ldquo;If we do outside the Constitution, this will trigger disharmony among other civil servants agitating for equity and we will be going to back days where salaries were reviewed without harmonisation,&rdquo; Rotich said.The Court of Appeal yesterday extended for seven days the ongoing negotiations between the medics and various government institutions. The parties are to appear in court on March 2.Rotich said the government&rsquo;s offer will see intern doctors enter the job market in Job Group L earning Sh196,000, far higher than other civil servants entering the workforces in Job Group K.Senior doctors in Job Group T will be earning a minimum of Sh478,000.He warned that the doctors' CBA demands cannot be implemented because it will further balloon the wage bill by Sh1.7 trillion, which is equivalent to total revenue collected annually.&ldquo;There is no way any government in the world can spend all its revenue to pay wages for its public servants,&rdquo; Rotich said.The committee was told that ongoing review of the medics&rsquo; salaries is based on SRC job evaluation and remuneration report for all civil servants where a budget of between Sh80 billion to Sh100 billion will used in the harmonised salaries.The new salary structure for public servants will be implemented in four years once SRC completes the job evaluation in July, Rotich said.
