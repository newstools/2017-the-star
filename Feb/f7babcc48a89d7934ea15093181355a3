Jailing KMPDU officials has aggravated an already bad situation, the National Gender and Equality Commission yesterday said. Labour Relations Court judge Hellen Wasilwa on Monday ordered seven officials jailed for a month for disobeying an order to end the 73-day doctors&rsquo; strike. But chairperson Winfred Lichuma said in a statement that the government should not compromise the quality of healthcare.She said the state should address the legitimate concerns raised by doctors instead of jailing them.&ldquo;While we remind doctors of their social contract, the Hippocratic Oath and the ethical concerns that the strike raises touching on their professional conduct, we are aware that they too have their right to fair pay and better working conditions,&rdquo; Lichuma said. She said it was the responsibility of government to ensure adequate resources, both human and financial, are deployed to ensure proper functioning and delivery of health services. Lichuma said the greatest responsibility in unlocking the stalemate lies with the national and county governments.
