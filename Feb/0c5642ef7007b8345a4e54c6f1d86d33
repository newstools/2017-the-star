After he was roasted on Twitter for leaking info that led to the crumbling of talks between doctors and the Ministry of Health on Monday, Director of Digital Communication in the Office of the President, Dennis Itumbi, has come out to defend himself.Dennis posted &ldquo;They want the lowest-paid doctor to get Sh221,000 and the highest-paid Sh940,000 (Plus allowances goes to Sh1.2m). GOK is actually offering to pay doctors way better than those in private hospitals.&rdquo; This led to stalling of the ongoing negotiations as details were leaked forgetting the agreement to maintain privacy.During The Morning Kiss, Adelle Onyango and Shaffie Weru called Dennis to get his side of the story.&ldquo;I knew you guys were going to call me. Doctors should know better than that. The Nation writes a story that Itumbi&rsquo;s facebook page is the one that is scuttle talks. But on the last paragraph says that The Nation learned from their sources that everything had been agreed on apart from the salaries, he said during the phone call.&ldquo;Before these other titles in government, I am deep down a journalist and I always have my sources. A journalist has sources.&rdquo;Adelle asked him to explain why his facebook post is causing all this drama and he said, &ldquo;They would have preferred for the public not to know that they are not negotiating for other things they are saying like equipment. But when they go to the negotiating rooms, they are only discussing their salaries and so they don&rsquo;t want that to go out,&rdquo; he concluded.Listen to the rest of the interview below;
