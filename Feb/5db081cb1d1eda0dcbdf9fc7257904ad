Ol Jororok MP John Waiganjo has criticised the judiciary and the opposition, saying they don&rsquo;t mean well for Kenya. He said there is conspiracy by the opposition to disrupt preparation for the August polls and the judiciary appears to be aiding their efforts.Waiganjo spoke at Ol Jororok stadium on Saturday, where he flagged off five buses he purchased for secondary schools in the constituency. He also accused the judiciary of ignoring the fact that the IEBC operations are guided by law, adding they have strict deadlines. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to have the August election postponed with even a day," Waiganjo said. He referred to the opposition leaders as tribal chiefs consumed by self-interests, who would go to any length, including causing chaos in the country to grab power."We don't have in Africa or elsewhere an abusive opposition like the one we have in Kenya," Waiganjo said
