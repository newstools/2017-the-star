Jubilee Party has suffered a major blow in Narok County after Narok West MP Patrick Ntutu, who seeking the governor&rsquo;s seat in the August polls, defected to Chama Cha Mashinani headed by Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto.Ntutu said he anticipated free and fair nomination but the system has already favoured the incumbent Samuel Tunai. He defended his decision to shift from JP, saying it was after immense consultation and subsequent recommendations from his people.Ntutu spoke at a Narok Hotel after meeting party aspirants together with Rutto on Wednesday. &ldquo;I am happy to find a new home and the debate whether I am in Jubilee Party or joining other parties has ended. I am in CCM to stay,&rdquo; he said.The MP will join the party on Monday and will host more than 40,000 people at his Olopirik home in Narok West subcounty.
