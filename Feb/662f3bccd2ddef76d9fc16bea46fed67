Wiper chairman David Musila has shelved plans to quit the party and use a different political outfit to run for Kitui governor."Following the resolving of the attempt to blatantly influence what essentially should be a free and fair nomination, I will now fully participate in the Wiper nomination to vie for Kitui governor," Musila said in a press statement.On February 13 at a rally in Mwingi Central, Musila appeared to consider ditching Wiper to ensure he is in the race for governor in Augusts. He said he felt things were not being done right in Wiper and added that his options were open.The Kitui senator said the National Executive Committee has resolved contentious issues on nominating candidates for the August 8 election.He said the ruling out of the use of Wiper membership cards and the shift to the use of national ID cards in Wiper primaries had ended disagreements.Musila said the earlier proposal to use Wiper membership cards as a modality of nominations had stirred controversy through issuance and hawking of the cards.He accused his rival Governor Julius Malombe of orchestrating massive irregularities to ensure he gets the Wiper ticket.Musila claimed that Malombe was using public servants to register Wiper members.But Malombe denied any wrongdoing in registering party members."Just like Musila, I was given 10,000 cards for registration of members. What crime have I committed by registering Wiper members?" he said.Malombe said Musila was afraid of facing him in the party primaries."Whatever modalities of Wiper nomination will apply, I can assure you I will beat Musila. That is the reality that is causing him nightmares," he said.The governor denied using public servants in Wiper membership registration.He said Kitui residents had confidence in his leadership and will reelect him overwhelmingly, even at the Wiper nominations.
