A family in Mt Elgon, Bungoma county, have been unable to identify the body of their soldier relative in Nairobi since Monday as there were many other families trying to identify their relatives killed in Somalia on Friday.Al Shabaab attacked the Kenya Defence Forces base in Kulbiyow early Friday morning and claimed they had killed 57 soldiers. Reports later estimated the death toll to 68, with claims that militants took away some bodies.KDF has disputed the figures but has not released an official death toll and number of the injured. Spokesman Col Paul Njuguna, however, said KDF suffered nine casualties.On Sunday, Bernard Kiboyi&rsquo;s family received news that he had been killed in the Friday Kulbiyow attack.Kiboyi was last home in December.&ldquo;[Officials] called my brother&rsquo;s wife and asked her to go to Gilgil as there is an issue. She went with our two brothers and confirmed he was dead,&rdquo; Kiboyi&rsquo;s brother Patrick said.Relatives then went to Nairobi on Monday to identify his body but were unable to by yesterday. The family says they want to collect his body on February 10 and bury him on February 11.Kiboyi, 47, was an army officer attached at Gilgil barracks and has served in the KDF for 24 years.Patrick said Kiboyi was the sole breadwinner. He said his brother is survived by four children and three of his sister&rsquo;s children, whom he was taking care of.&ldquo;We are appealing to the government to assist us with educating these children since their mother is a housewife and their father died in the line of duty serving this country,&rdquo; Patrick said.He added, &ldquo;We want the President to consider withdrawing our troops from Somalia before we lose more of them. Let them guard our boundaries since these suicide bombers have nothing to lose ... This war is not ending anytime soon and if it goes on we might lose more people.&rdquo;
