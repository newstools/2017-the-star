Live bands have been banned from playing in Athi River subcounty at night. Machakos deputy county commissioner Geoffrey Omoding said many bar owners illegally host live bands who play to the wee hours of the morning.He said the county wants to reduce the number of bars from 1,000 to 500.&ldquo;Some operate within residential areas causing a nuisance. All bar businesses should operate in commercial premises,&rdquo; Omoding said.He urged the Machakos government to vet applications before issuing licences for bar businesses.Omoding said all licences issued to bars in residential premises should be revoked.He said officials will crack down on bars operating in residential areas. Omoding said some traders simultaneously operate restaurants, yet they only have bar licences.STRICT CLASSIFICATIONHe called for strict classification of businesses when issuing licences.&ldquo;Since the businesses are operating illegally, it cannot be ruled out that they sell illicit liquor,&rdquo; Omoding said.He said some bar operators cooperate and forward information on illegal activity to security agencies, leading to arrests. Omoding said the subcounty will not issue licences to bar owners who have previously been charged with operating illegally.He said the culprits should relocate from the subcounty or start other businesses.In November last year, the National Environment Management Authority and Nairobi county officials raided and shut down the Space Lounge on Ngong Road over continued noise pollution.The raid took place at about 10pm, after continued complaints by residents of loud music from clubs around the residental houses on Ngong Road.
