Kenyan boxers Fatma Zarika, Morris Okela and Joseph Onyango knocked out their respective opponents in the &lsquo;Making of Champion&rsquo; contests at Carnivore, Nairobi, raising questions over the quality of match making in the country.Reigning Africa Boxing Union champion Daniel Wanyonyi outpointed Tanzania&rsquo;s Karama Nyilawila in their 10-round scheduled super middle bout while Onyango proved too strong for his Ugandan rival Patrick Atuhairwe. A dejected Atuhairwe even after being knocked down in round one insisted he was still strong and called for another rematch in Kampala. But Onyango, who tormented him with heavy body punches told the press that he&rsquo;s through with the Ugandan, and now wants a tougher opponent.&ldquo;Time has come when I feel I need more competitive bouts and therefore the Ugandan would better look for other opponents as I am done with him.Former Kenyan international Okola, better known as &ldquo;Maketho&rdquo;, was on cloud nine after making easy work of the Malawian boxer, whom boxing analysts feel displayed a sissy performance.Flora Machela of Tanzania lost to WBC champ Zarika in what turned out to be another mismatch. &ldquo;The punch that sent her to sleep could not even hurt a mosquito,&rdquo; said one of the fans after the bout. &ldquo;I was expecting more from the Tanzanian but I was surprised how fast she went down without resistance,&rdquo; said Zarika after the fight.
