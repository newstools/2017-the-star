Senator Paul Njoroge yesterday was charged at the Naivasha law courts with creating disturbance.This came a day after he was involved in a gun drama at a Naivasha petrol station.The nominated legislator, who represents the disabled, spent Tuesday night at the Naivasha police station, where his licensed gun was confiscated. Njoroge appeared humbled.The Vivo Energy Company workers&rsquo; lawyer rejected the charge against the senator and said it was lenient. Steven Luseno said Njoroge was caught on camera firing in the air and should have been charged with misuse of a firearm.According to the charge sheet, Njoroge created disturbance in a manner likely to make a breach of the peace by firing at the workers using his Ceska pistol.&ldquo;The charge sheet has not raised any issue about firearm misuse and the senator has gone ahead to post a threatening statement in his Facebook account,&rdquo; Luseno said.He said the charge was not reflective of the complaints by his clients, who felt their lives were in great danger.Luseno filed an application, demanding the matter be revisited and the file forwarded to the DPP for advice, saying a serious crime had been committed. He further wanted the case transferred from Naivasha to Nairobi and Njoroge barred from contacting the complainants.But defence lawyer Francis Mburu urged the court to dismiss the application, saying the senator had been disarmed by police. He said the complainants had not recorded any threats to the police and there was no tangible evidence given to the court to allow the matter to be transferred to Nairobi.&ldquo;The senator does not represent Nakuru county as alleged but the disabled nationally and the charge sheet can be amended as the case proceeds,&rdquo; Mburu said.
