Former Kamukunji MP Simon Mbugua yesterday resigned from the NGOs Coordination Board to run for the seat he once held. He will run against the incumbent Yusuf Hassan, who was first elected in a by-election in 2011 on the PNU ticket. &ldquo;The people of Kamukunji once gave me the chance to serve them. I am coming to ask them to give me the chance again so that I still serve them. Regardless of tribe, race and whichever background, I will serve all people equally,&rdquo; he said. Mbugua pledged to restore essential services. &ldquo;Poor drainage, petty crime and harassment of businesspeople will be a thing of the past,&rdquo; he said.
