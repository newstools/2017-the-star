He noted that a serious crime had been committed.Luseno also said the case should be transferred from to Nairobi as his clients felt threatened. He further said the Senator should be barred from contacting the complainants.&ldquo;The charge sheet has not raised any issue about firearm misuse and the Senator has gone ahead to post a threatening statement on his Facebook account,&rdquo; he said.But defence lawyer Francis Mburu asked the court to dismiss the application noting that the Senator was disarmed and the gun place in police custody.Mburu further noted that the complainants had not reported any threats to police and said there wasn't sufficient evidence to warrant the transfer of the case.&ldquo;The Senator does not represent Nakuru county as alleged, but the disabled nationally, and the charge sheet can be amended as the case proceeds,&rdquo; he argued.On his part, the state counsel Sebastian Mutinda accused the complainant&rsquo;s lawyer of fishing and seeking unnecessary delays.Mburu also said it was not up to the complainant to direct the DPP on what charges to prefer and added that investigations had been carried out professionally.&ldquo;As the case goes on, the new charges can be preferred against the accused if there new evidence is adduced and there is no need to stop the hearing of the case,&rdquo; he said.Zainabu Abdul, Deputy Registrar of the High Court, will make her ruling in the afternoon.
