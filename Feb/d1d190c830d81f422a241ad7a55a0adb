Negotiations to have four Kenyans facing life imprisonment in Juba relocate to Kenya have been paralysed as an appeal is yet to be heard, the government has said.The four, Anthony Mwadime, Ravi Ramesh, Boniface Muriuki and Anthony Keya, were jailed on counts of forgery and money laundering, resulting to the loss of $14 million in South Sudan President Salva Kiir's office.The four were employees of Juba-based company Click Technologies, that specialises in graphic design, sales and computer repairs.Speaking to the Star on Friday Kenya's Director of Foreign Affairs Washington Oloo said negotiations had been barred as Kenya lacked extradition relations with South Sudan.Oloo pointed out that the negotiation process was based on friendly ties and they hoped it would go down well."We intervened and we hope the appeal goes down well in their favor, but if this won&rsquo;t be possible then we will try and initiate a bilateral transfer," he said. Ravi Rapshta, a relative to Ramesh, expressed disappointment in Kenya's efforts to intervene in the case."Nowadays the Ministry of Foreign Affairs does not give us audience we are on our own fighting our own battles. The lawyers are not even allowed to go and see the prisoners,&rdquo; Ravi said.More on this: Kenyans sentenced to life in South Sudan were not helped by State, kins claimRead: KHCR want State to secure release of Kenyans serving life sentence in South SudanFamily members have disputed privileges the government claimed it had intervened for on behalf of the prisoners. Among them was access to communication with their families and a surety that they were healthy.The government had also ensured they would hire a lawyer for the prisoners."These are things the Ministry of Foreign Affairs says just to defend itself in the media. I am telling you, our people are suffering in Juba and they (Kenyan government) are doing very little to change that," Ravi said. But Oloo said the law is clear and bound anyone from involving themselves in a matter that is already in court."As you are aware there is an appeal in court and this has barred the negotiations from proceeding until it is done and we hope the outcome will be on their favour we have to wait," Oloo said.Under South Sudan&rsquo;s Criminal Procedure Act of 2008, all sentences of death or life imprisonment must be confirmed by the Supreme Court, the highest court in the land, before taking effect. Ravi told the Star that upon appeal the ruling was supposed to take 60 days but had been stalled for over 7 months now under unclear circumstances."Since July we have been waiting for an appeal the case was biased if it was not why are they finding it hard to try them in the appeal," she said.Ravi revealed that they had appealed to the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) to intervene and deliver a fair hearing.
