Scientific research risks losing credibility if duplications are not addressed, a scientist has warned. Africa Population and Health Research Center Kenya senior research officer Cheikh Faye yesterday said the trend makes donors unwilling to fund projects. &ldquo;The duplication artificially inflates an author&rsquo;s publication record while placing a burden on journal editors,&rdquo; he said. Faye spoke at Kenyatta University during the sixth science gateway and e-infrastructure in Africa workshop.He said the practice causes lack of trust and encourages unethical behaviour. &ldquo;There have been repeated through duplication. This has made donors raise questions,&rdquo; he said.Scientists from Kenya, UK, Italy, Uganda, Nigeria, and Sweden attended the one-day workshop themed &ldquo;e-infrastructure and open science in support of public health&rdquo;. Faye said it is hard to trace the duplicated research. He said one in every five researches could be duplicates. &ldquo;Thirty thousand papers per year are duplicated around the world,&rdquo; he said.
