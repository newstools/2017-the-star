The Kenya National Union of Teachers yesterday accused the national examiner and Education CS Fred Matiang&rsquo;i of colluding to deliberately fail candidates in last year&rsquo;s KCSE exam.Secretary general Wilson Sossion reiterated teachers&rsquo; position that the results were cooked and hurriedly released with a view to condemning teachers as non-performing. He wants the results recalled for moderation.Appearing before the National Assembly Education committee, he said the Kenyan National Examinations Council omitted crucial stages in processing the examination.Sossion was accompanied by chairman Muzo Nzili and Treasurer John Matiang&rsquo;i, among other top Knut officials. Also present were Kenya Union of Post-Primary Education Teachers officials, including secretary general Akello Misori.Sossion said his presentation was a harmonised version by both Knut and Kuppet. &ldquo;It should be noted that the examiners were not allowed to consult on the wide range of marks before awarding them to students. In some cases, a predetermined highest mark was set,&rdquo; he said.Sossion said the marking scheme was made deliberately for the students to fail, with strong bias against boys, who ended up posting poor scores in humanities subjects. &ldquo;Even in cases where questions had been repeated from previous KCSE papers, the marking differed sharply,&rdquo; he said.Sossion attributed the &ldquo;huge and unprecedented disparity&rdquo; in the performance of boys and girls to use of one grading system for all subjects.&ldquo;Everything was hurried. No crosschecking, verification or validation was done. There was poor coordination of marking,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Teachers&rsquo; unions were not part of the release of the results, a very unfortunate departure showing an unprecedented curse.&rdquo;
