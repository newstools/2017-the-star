President Donald Trump is "evaluating the situation" on his national security adviser's contact with a Russian envoy, the White House says.Michael Flynn came under scrutiny amid reports he spoke to the Russian ambassador to the US about sanctions before Donald Trump's inauguration.Vice-President Mike Pence publicly denied the allegations on behalf of the retired Army lieutenant general.Flynn has since told the White House that sanctions may have been discussed.It is illegal for private citizens to conduct US diplomacy, and the calls happened late last year, before Flynn was appointed to the administration.White House spokesman Sean Spicer said on Monday afternoon: "The president is evaluating the situation."He is speaking to the vice-president relative to the conversation the VP had with General Flynn and also speaking to various other people about what he considers the single most important subject there is - our national security. "Spicer's statement came soon after White House counsellor Kellyanne Conway said Flynn had "the full confidence of the president"."It's a big week for General Flynn. He's the point of contact for many of these foreign visits," she told MSNBC.Flynn has apologised to the vice-president over the controversy surrounding his conversations with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday that Flynn and Kislyak did not discuss lifting sanctions.According to Politico, Trump's adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is scouting for possible candidates to replace Flynn.Meanwhile, the Washington Post reports that the Trump White House was warned last month by the US Justice Department that Flynn could be vulnerable to Russian blackmail.
