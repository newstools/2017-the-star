Luhyas will unanimously vote for Jubilee party if Raila Odinga becomes the Opposition's presidential flag bearer, Bumula MP Boniface Otsiula has said.Otsiula said the community will only vote for the Opposition if ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi or Ford Kenya's Moses Wetang'ula are on the ticket."If none of our brothers is the opposition flag bearer, let no one come to Western and tell us to vote for Raila. We will be very bitter," he said on Wednesday.He noted Luhyas have been voting for Raila since 2007 and are yet to have a victory, and added that it is Raila's turn to return the favour by backing a candidate from the community in the August 8 polls.In July last year, Otsiula asked Wetang'ula to ditch Raila's Cord coalition saying his political future does not lie in it."If our Senator still thinks he will be Cord flag bearer, he better forget it and move to where there is light before he is left in darkness after next year's poll," the MP had said.Early this week, opposition leaders unveiled a 12-member team to officially register the National Super Alliance and name its presidential candidate.The team led by Siaya Senator James Orengo will also work on the coalition's instruments.Mudavadi allayed fears that those eyeing the super coalition's presidential ticket will lose out after a candidate is nominated for the August 8 general election.More on this: NASA will take care of all Opposition leaders, Mudavadi says amid fallout fearsBut Otsiula noted that the headache of choosing a flag bearer might lead to a fallout among opposition leaders that will see Jubilee win the election "early in the morning".The Jubilee MP said it would be unfair to give the presidential hopefuls from Western a raw deal.Read: You will never be Cord flag bearer, MP Otsiula tells Wetang'ulaAlso read: Raila will compete for 2017 ticket, says ODMOtsiula asked residents to turn up in large numbers and register as voters.
