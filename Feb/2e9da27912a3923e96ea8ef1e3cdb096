An American missionary who pleaded guilty to having an ivory bangle will either spend five years in prison or pay a Sh1 million fine.Donna Pontier, 57, said she was found with an old ivory bangle weighing 10g and valued at Sh8,000, without a permit. This was at terminal 1C at the JKIA in Nairobi on February 20.The prosecution said on Friday that security personnel noticed the piece of jewellery while going about their duties at the bay.They then informed KWS officers who went to the terminal and arrested the missionary.Pontier confirmed that this was what took place when she appeared before JKIA resident magistrate Muthoni Nzibe.In mitigation, she told the court she had been a missionary for many years and was en route to Uganda for work. She further said she was not aware that the bangle was made of ivory."I was given the bangle as a gift in 1988 and have been wearing it since," she told court.The woman said she wore the bangle in ignorance and that she pleaded guilty because she found herself in an unfortunate position."Being a missionary and believer, I believe I must do what is right before God," she said.But she prayed for leniency and asked for a non-custodial sentence.While delivering the sentence, the magistrate noted that the law places the punishment on anyone found with a wildlife trophy, or individuals who deal in the items or manufacture anything else from them without permits.Nzibe ordered the return of the bangle to Kenya Wildlife Service.
