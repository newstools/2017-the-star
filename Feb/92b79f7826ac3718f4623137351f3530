The Elgeyo Marakwet county payroll manager has been arrested over the loss of Sh14 million reportedly swindled from the county government.Livingstone Kiptoo allegedly opened three separate bank accounts and had been overpaying his monthly salary for the last four years.Deputy Governor Gabriel Lagat said an audit detected the scam and that a police probe led to arrests.He said Kiptoo interfered with the county's Integrated Payroll Payment Program (IPP) since he was in charge of the computer system for payment of salaries.&ldquo;He had access to the payroll system and its passwords. He corrupted the system and overpaid himself and its was not easy to detect the anomaly&rdquo;, Lagat said."The County government budgeting process was seriously affected though it was not easy to notice what was happening because it was done through a system which he messed up with."Read: Millions lost by counties, says Auditor GeneralExpert comment: Wanted: Citizen action against corruption cartelsIt had been alleged that Kiptoo was Governor Alex Tolgos' relative but Lagat refuted this, saying the remarks were aimed at mudslinging the Governor."He was seconded to the county by the national government and is thus not related to the Governor," he said.Keiyo OCPD Mwenda Meme said Kiptoo had been arrested and that CID officers were finalising investigations before the suspect is taken to court.&ldquo;We have frozen all the banks accounts that the suspect was using as part of investigations," Meme said.Speaker Albert Kochei said the county assembly had frequently questioned the increasing wage bill for county employees. He said the scam resulted in the use of more money to pay monthly salaries.Kochei said they carried out a head count of workers several times to detect the problem, but that after finding no issue with the number of employees they resorted to investigating computer systems."I directed the assembly to form a joint committee on Budget and Health to look into the matter surrounding head counts of staff in the county, their salary scales and other relevant details to know the truth," the Speaker said.Other employees said the suspect had been living a flamboyant life and driving high class cars.This comes a day after Trans Nzoia MCAs were apprehended and charged for abuse of office and misappropriation of funds.Thirty-eight ward representatives, the Speaker and clerk Ainea Indakwa were accused of illegally obtaining Sh47,000 illegal allowances each to attend a colleague's funeral two years ago.More on this: Trans Nzoia MCAs charged with graft unable to pay Sh150,000 cash bail
