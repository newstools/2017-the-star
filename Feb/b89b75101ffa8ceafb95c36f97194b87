A group of youths have urged politicians eyeing the Athi River Township MCA seat to shelve their bids in favour of P-Unit rapper Francis Hamisi (pictured), popularly known as Frasha.Group spokesman John Musembi said, &ldquo;We recognise all youths who have shown interests in the seat, but we just want to tell them to swallow their pride and step down for Frasha.&rdquo; He said Frasha has the youths&rsquo; interests at heart. Musembi spoke during a youth meeting last week.He said the rapper has shown leadership qualities and abilities through his &ldquo;I am Frasha Foundation&rdquo;.&ldquo;We should not just cast our votes for the sake of it. Let us support one of our own who has demonstrated he can transform this community,&rdquo; Musembi said.
