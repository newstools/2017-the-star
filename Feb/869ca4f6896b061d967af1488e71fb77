Area MCA Peter Thomi said the armed herders burnt houses and shot at an APC that was patrolling the area.Laikipia Farmers&rsquo; Association chairman Martin Evans said, &ldquo;We were very sad to hear Moherai was seriously injured in the line of duty yesterday. We wish him a speedy recovery.&rdquo;Moherai was among other security officers, who drove out animals grazing illegally at Kifuku Ranch.Police boss Simon Kipkeu said the officers were getting back to their vehicles at around 6pm, headed for a debriefing, when one of the herder shot at the officer. Kipkeu told journalists yesterday the officers had finished driving out the animals when the attacker shot from a thicket.&ldquo;There were several ranches in which the herders were grazing illegally and we had managed to drive the livestock out. One of them took advantage of the darkness and shot the officer and disappeared,&rdquo; Kipkeu said.He retaliated that all the immigrant herders from Baringo, Samburu and Isiolo counties would be driven back despite the attack.

These herders have now turned into bandits and we will deal with them ruthlessly,&rdquo; Kipkeu told journalists.The herders have taken over Kifuku Ranch, Suyian Conservancy, Laikipia Nature Conservancy, Borana, Segera and Ilng&rsquo;wesi, among others.
