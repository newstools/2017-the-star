As I looked over the plains not far from the Hyena dam near the fence line, a herd of Kongoni were feeding. To their left, a whitish shape appeared in the long grass. The shape disappeared and then reappeared, then after looking through the binoculars, my heart leaped!It was a cheetah! I drove closer and saw it stalking and chasing a herd of Kongoni. If only this was now, but sadly, it was in January 2012, and the last cheetah cub sighting was in April 2012. Yes, cheetah are the rarest cats in the Nairobi National Park. Ironically, the exact place where the cheetah chased the Kongoni was in the Southern bypass highway.It is difficult to say how many cheetah are still in the park, with a single sighting in recent months. The park had a healthy population, but sadly, changes in their favourable environment caused them to disappear in less than 10 years. Cheetah are fast, efficient hunters, reaching speeds of close to 110kph, but are very sensitive to human developments and also easily threatened by other large predators.There is a fairly heathly population of more than 20 cheetah south of the Nairobi National Park on the Athi-Kapiti plains. It would be very sad if Cheetah are no longer resident in the Nairobi National Park. Many hope the KWS will find a way of re-introducing other cheetahs into the park, so their future will not be a case of going, going, GONE? Sadly, the developments of mankind have indeed &ldquo;cheated the cheetahs&rdquo; of land they used to roam.The park is open daily from 06h00 to 19h00.For more information on the park you can link to the following websites: www.kws.org or www.nairobigreenline.com or on Facebook.
