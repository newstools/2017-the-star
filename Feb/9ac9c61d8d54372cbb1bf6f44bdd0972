Meru Governor Peter Munya has declared he will never share a political platform with Deputy President William Ruto.Both men are eyeing the presidency in 2022. Munya said he supports President Uhuru Kenyatta's reelection, but his ambitions have put him on the collision path with Ruto. He thinks Ruto is intolerant."I have lost count of [the number of] trips the DP has made in my county. He is there sometimes every other week accompanied by MPs and senators targetting me," Munya told the Star."He is annoyed with me because I declared I will run for president in 2022 against him. [So] he is using all means to undermine Munya."He said Ruto wants all Kenyans to be sycophants and follow him blindly. "His strategy has been to clear any roadblock that seems to complicate or threaten his 2022 bid," Munya said.He said Ruto's public criticism of him in rallies organised by Ruto in Meru are a show of "terrible political cowardice".Munya said he will not attend Ruto's rallies in Meru if they continue disagreeing and embarrassing each other."But my advice to Ruto is that he should be more civil and accommodating in his approach to politics as no one has the monopoly ideas and we are in a competitive world," he said.Munya said the DP's criticism has embolden his resolve to run for president.He said he refused to fold PNU and join the Jubilee Party to build democracy and cater for those who will be unfairly locked out of the JP primaries."Though the party has resolved to back President Uhuru's reelection, we will field candidates in all other seats starting from governor to MCA," Munya said.He dismissed fears that going it alone will undermine Uhuru's support base, which in turn might affect his total vote tally. Munya ruled out direct nominations, saying it is an affront to democracy.He said he is confident of trouncing his opponents in the governor race.
