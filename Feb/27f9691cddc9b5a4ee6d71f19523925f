THE government has ordered the phone companies to allow it to tap any calls, read text messages and analyse mobile money transactions nationwide.The state says this vast invasion of privacy is all in aid of tracking counterfeit devices! But the timing of the Communication Authority of Kenya&rsquo;s order to the telcos could not have come at a worse time. The ruling JP is seeking reelection but it will forever be associated with a move that will almost certainly be universally unpopular. This massive surveillance has been outsourced to a company contracted by the government. When the contracting took place and what it cost remains unclear. The telco that defies the CAK order will see a massive migration of subscribers from the ones that obey it &ndash; including of people with nothing to hide and who support national security but value their online privacy. In the absence of a comprehensive data protection law, Big Brother spying could swiftly find common cause with Big Corruption.
