So who will the NASA candidate be? That is the question that is dominating conversations as the opposition leaders put pen to paper today. We are told that whereas Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka has insisted he is the best-placed to defeat President Uhuru Kenyatta, those within the coalition believe that race is really between Raila Odinga and Musalia Mudavadi. Raila because he commands that largest number of voters and Musalia because the ANC leader is widely seen as a safe pair of hands.**********It seems a good number of governors and very ambitious politicians after their positions have secretly registered briefcase parties. The parties are registered through trusted proxies and provide an alternative avenue to the top jobs in the counties. Since most aspirants are sure of being on the ballot, the small parties are dishing out tickets at exorbitant prices. The nomination fees are higher than those of the established parties in most of the small parties. Among the 47 governors, only Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua has come out to publicly declare his party. And it is only Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana who wants to join Wiper and drop his party. To be smart, the governors have moved to the courts to dismiss the section of the law that limits party hopping.************Lawyers at the State Law Office are afraid of even going to court for a simple and laughable reason. Water rationing has caught up with them and they can't access the washrooms, which leave a foul smell in the corridors all the time. Visitors to the offices have been praying that maybe someone talks to the Evans Kidero administration "nicely" to minimize this suffering of committed public servants who can't publicly air their frustrations - by having the water supply restored by City Hall.*************A female police officer attached to Nyayo House within the CBD is on the loose. The lady, who was previously married to a son of a former administrator turned politician before they broke up, is said to be harassing every other visitor who accesses the building for assistance. Those who have undergone her cruel attitude say that only those who oil her palms get the assistance they seek, while those who don't are either chased out of the building or denied service altogether. The officer's male colleagues are always in standby mode and will never hesitate to descend on those perceived to have gone against the word of the policewoman. Whether these are the new terms the officers man the building under, only time will tell.*************
