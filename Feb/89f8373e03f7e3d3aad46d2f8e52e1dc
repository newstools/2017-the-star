Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho has denied he&rsquo;s running a secret militia which the state claimed is being groomed to cause chaos and help him retain his seat. Speaking on Tuesday at his office, Joho also denied walking around with armed force as claimed by the government.This statement trashes Senator Hassan Omar&rsquo;s allegations that those around Joho are heavily armed and can bring down Deputy President William Ruto&rsquo;s entourage based on their powerful weapons. Omar said about 15 guns and more than 450 bullets revolve around his convoy.Regional coordinator Nelson Marwa last month said the county is recruiting ex-military officers as inspectorate officers and they are being trained. He said they have swelled in numbers in preparation for the August 8 polls. Marwa said the county is hell bent on intimidating opponents and scare them away.Marwa said most of the ex-military officers are not on the county&rsquo;s payroll, therefore it is difficult to know if the salary they receive is equivalent to the job done.Marwa said they could be earning excess for a bigger project.Joho said, &ldquo;Some people are saying I am controlling an illegal armed militia and I should hand them over. We are not in Hollywood my friends &hellip;or Nollwhood.&rdquo; Joho said the inspectorate department head office is in Tudor and the state should storm there and arrest any suspected militia.&ldquo;All the employees of the inspectorate reports in Tudor, what are you waiting for, they are not hiding?&rdquo; he said.The governor said if he is being escorted by militia, the state should take action. Marwa said some officers in the inspectorate, whom the governor absolved of any wrongdoing, are being trained at a secret gun shooting range.
