The High Court in Kitui has postponed the murder trial of two CID officers to April 4.Officers Gilbert Maina and Paul Odoyo had appeared in court on Thursday. They are charged with murdering Ngandi Malia at Mwingi Level 4 Hospital on August 25 last year.Two other CID officers, Daniel Thuku and Vincent Rono, who are co-accused, have never appeared in court. Ngandi was admitted in the hospital ward for gunshot wounds but he was later shot dead in his hospital bed.Justice Lilian Mutende postponed the hearing after Senior Prosecution counsel Margaret Matiru requested adjournment. She said there were issues of witness safety that must be addressed before the grial can proceed. Early last month, Maina and Odoyo were each released on a Sh2 million bond.The officers had been in custody since their arrest in August last year.
