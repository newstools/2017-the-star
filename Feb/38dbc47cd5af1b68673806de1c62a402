Planting of trees in private-owned land has contributed to the increase of forest cover in Kenya to seven per cent.This according to the Environment principal secretary Charles Sunkuli has helped increase Kenya's forest cover that was at 1.7 per cent in 2013.&ldquo;Last year, the government made a deliberate move to encourage individuals to plant trees in their farms in order to achieve the 10 per cent cover. This initiative has enormously improved afforestation in our country,&rdquo; he said.Sunkuli however noted that land degradation is still at a big challenge that threatens food security and livelihoods.He was speaking yesterday in a hotel in Nairobi while opening a workshop that sought to set targets to oversee the sad condition of land degradation in Kenya.&ldquo;Fragile ecosystems are worst affected due to rapid land conversion for agriculture and settlements as population rises," Sunkuli said.He emphasized the need to promote sustainable land management failure to which the country will not be able to feed its people in the next 15 years."The government is keen on rehabilitating over five million hectares of degraded land across the country and promoting planting of drought tolerant trees in drylands," the PS said.Sunkuli added that the ministry is in the process of finalising the Kenya Atlas of changing environment and the Kenya Wetlands atlas which will broadly give a trend of land degradation hotspots.&ldquo;The ministry is also working on restoration of crucial water catchments areas in Kenya including Lake Magadi and Lake Kenyatta areas which have been drying up at an alarming rate,&rdquo; Sunkuli said.
