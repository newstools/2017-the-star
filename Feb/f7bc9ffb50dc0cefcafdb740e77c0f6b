Kiambu Governor William Kabogo (pictured) on Friday accused the Senate Public Accounts Committee of playing political games instead of solving the Auditor General&rsquo;s queries.He singled out Kiambu Senator Kimani Wamatangi, whom he accused of using his position to play politics. Kabogo said counties with many corruption cases were omitted from the committee&rsquo;s report. He was speaking at his Thika town office.On Thursday, the PAC recommended that Kabogo and six other governors be investigated and prosecuted if found culpable. They are Daniel Waithaka (Nyandarua), Jack Ranguma (Kisumu), Moses Lenolkulal (Samburu), Okoth Obado (Migori), Patrick Khaemba (Trans Nzoia) and Sospeter Ojaamong (Busia).Kabogo said it was unfair for the committee to leave out some counties that were named in the audit reports. &ldquo;Why is the Senate committee giving some governors a clean bill of health, while punishing others who have nothing to be punished for? I read politics in this whole matter,&rdquo; he said.The PAC is chaired by Kisumu Senator Anyang&rsquo; Nyong&rsquo;o, who has expressed interest in running for Kisumu governor. Other members include John Lonyangapuo (vice chairman), Kimani Wamatangi, Stephen ole Ntutu, Karue Muriuki, Boni Khalwale, Hassan Omar, Amos Wako, Mong&rsquo;are Okong&rsquo;o, George Khaniri and Henry ole Ndiema. Kabogo said he appeared before the committee and answered all queries raised in the audit report.
