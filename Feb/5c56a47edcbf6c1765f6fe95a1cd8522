Mwingi Central MP Joe Mutambu has urged Wiper chairman David Musila to leave the party early, or risk being locked out of the governor race amid claims of party leader Kalonzo Musyoka favouring the incumbent.Asked to drop governor bidOn January 23 during a voter registration drive in Kitui, Kalonzo asked Musila to run for reelection as senator and let Governor Julius Malombe also run for reelection.In a press conference later, Musila said he will run for governor even if Kalonzo does not support him.Speaking in Mwingi East during a voter registration drive, Mutambu said Musila should change parties early before he is locked out of the contest.Only way to win&ldquo;I have heard Musila call for Governor Malombe to challenge him in a 100 metre race since Malombe says Musila is old. I want to urge him to use his experience in the race and run as quickly as he can to leave Wiper party for the incumbent governor,&rdquo; Mutambu said.&ldquo;By the look of things, that&rsquo;s the only way for Musila to survive in Kitui politics.&rdquo;For some time Musila has been heard assuring Kitui residents that Wiper has its owners and as party chairman he is sure he will get the Wiper nomination.Malombe has, several times, called for the IEBC to oversee the Wiper nominations.You can&rsquo;t referee and contestHe argues that Musila should not oversee the primaries because he is a contestant and &ldquo;cannot be a player and referee&rdquo; at the same time.Malombe said he is sure Musila and Ngilu will share 15 per cent of Kitui votes in the election, while 85 per cent of residents will reelect him.The governor has said for Wiper nominations to be fair, Musila should not oversee the primaries.Mutambu also said he wants the IEBC to come up with clear policies on how Kenyans will be allowed to vote using only their ID cards, as currently there is no clear legislation on it.The outspoken legislator said it would be unfair for people to be allowed to register without being issued voter&rsquo;s cards, only to be turned away on August 8. This could be a scheme to reduce the region&rsquo;s votes, he said.
