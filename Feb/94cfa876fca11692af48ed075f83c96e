The government has introduced a new allowance for all health workers to prevent a mega strike that would have included mortuary attendants.The Health ministry said the new health service allowance will cost the government at least Sh4.5 billion every year.Clinicians will be the biggest beneficiaries, getting Sh20,000 every month, while mortuary attendants will earn an additional Sh7,500.Health PS Nicholas Muraguri said the allowance will apply only to the 17 cadres that did not benefit from the Sh15,000-Sh20,000 allowance awarded to nurses last year.He said they have shown responsibility and have kept hospitals operational in the absence of doctors, who have been on strike for 80 days now.&ldquo;Such an award will boost health workers&rsquo; morale and set a precedent of employee relations that grievances can be solved through negotiations, as opposed to industrial action,&rdquo; Muraguri said in a letter to Treasury PS Kamau Thugge.Kenya has 19 cadres of health workers. Doctors and nurses have their own separate unions, while the 17 other cadres are represented by the Kenya Health Professionals Society.&ldquo;For equality, there is need to harmonise the allowance paid to nurses and various health cadres,&rdquo; Muraguri said in the January 26 letter.KHPS argues that members have a heavier workload in terms of responsibility and leadership, compared to the nurses.Members were angered when the striking nurses were awarded an allowance last year. The nurses had threatened to go strike this week.The other members include physiotherapists, occupational therapists, plaster technicians, orthopaedic technologists, pharmaceutical technologists and dental technologists.Clinical officers will also get an extra Sh10,000 monthly call allowance, which they complain is too little because doctors have been awarded a Sh80,000 call allowance.&ldquo;We kindly ask you to include the call allowance for the clinical officers at the cost of Sh10,000 per month. This has become a bone of contention, which may lead to industrial strife if not factored in the framework,&rdquo; Council of Governors CEO Jacqueline Mogeni said in a letter to Treasury PS yesterday.Kenya Union of Clinical Officers deputy secretary general Austin Otieno said the call allowance was long overdue.
