CCU leader Wavinya Ndeti on Sunday urged the IEBC to extend the mass voter registration deadline. Registration ends today. She said registration should be an ongoing process, not one that is done once in a while. One of the IEBC's mandate is continuous registration of voters. &ldquo;... setting deadlines is a move to deny Kenyans a right to exercise their democratic right,&rdquo; Ndeti said. She spoke at Sengera-Bosoti ward in Bomachoge Chache constituency, where she opened a party office.
