Jua kali artisans at Soko Posta market in Busia town have expressed fear of being evicted from the site.The traders have been at the market for 30 years.The county government decided to relocate the artisans to pave way for the expansion of the rural access road connecting the open air market.On Wednesday, the traders told the Star they will not vacate, despite threats by the county to forcibly evict them after 14 days.One trader said, &ldquo;The two-week notice is too short. As it is, our daily earnings are meagre. What does the county want us to do?&rdquo;The traders said they pay Sh200 each daily to the county government, but it refuses to build them permanent stalls.&ldquo;Instead of them building stalls for us, they are issuing us with a notice to vacate the place we have been operating in for 30 years,&rdquo; a trader, who sought anonymity, said.In 2015, the county set aside more than Sh10 million to support micro and small businesses in Busia. Governor Sospeter Ojaamong said the money would be lent to jua kali artisans in open markets at low interest rates.
