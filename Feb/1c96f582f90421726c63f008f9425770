A piece of tissue paper reportedly written on by the late lawyer Willie Kimani hours before his murder was the centre of trial proceedings on Wednesday.Kimani, 32, his client Josephat Mwenda and taxi driver Joseph Muiruri were killed and their bodies dumped in Oldonyo Sabuk river in June last year.Four AP officers - Fredrick Leliman, Leonard Maina, Stephen Chebulet and Silvia Wanjiku - and suspected informer Peter Kamau have denied the murder charges.The two-leafed toilet paper is being regarded as one of the major pieces of evidence in the case.The court heard that it was kept safe by a boda boda rider who has since testified in private before being handed over to investigators.IJM officer Rose Gakii said Mwenda's wife, identified as Rebecca, called her in distress on June 23, 2016, saying her husband, Willie and Muiruri had been arrested."She called me at about 8 pm and told me that a man gave her the news. I then asked her to give me the man's number and I called him," Gakii said.She said the man informed her he had a note that was thrown to him by the men who were being held at the Syokimau AP camp."Please call number xxxxx and let Rose know that Willie and Mwenda have been arrested and held at Syokimau. We are in danger," the note written in Swahili read.Syokimau Administration Police Camp that was torched by protesters seeking justice for murdered lawyer Willie Kimani and two others, July 6, 2016. /COURTESYRead: Protesters burn Syokimau AP camp where murdered lawyer was held"I asked him to keep it safe and I reported the matter to the investigator," she said.She told the court her office was unsuccessful in trying to trace the three men.Gakii said earlier Rebecca and Mwenda had reported to IPOA about harassment by Leliman.Leliman reportedly shot Mwenda after they disagreed over personal issues after which the policeman charged him with illegal possession of bhang which he says is not true.Mwenda sought help from IJM and claimed AP officers were intimidating and pressuring him to withdraw the case.More on this: Willie Kimani client threatened with fake charges, gun before murder - witnessShe said International Justice Mission used to do shopping for the couple, offer psychosocial support and were in the process of relocating them.Upon cross-examination, Gakii said they had not yet placed the couple under witness protection as the matter was still under investigation.The hearing continues.Read: IJM launches petition on justice for murdered lawyer Willie KimaniThe bodies of Lawyer Willie Kimani, his client Josephat Mwenda and Taxi driver Joseph Muiruri during their requiem mass of service at the Consolata Srine in Westlands, Nairobi on July 8, 2016. /JACK OWUOR
