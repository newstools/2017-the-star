The Independent Policing Oversight Authority chairman Macharia Njeru has accused Interior PS Karanja Kibicho of sabotaging the authority's work.Njeru said the authority would have no problems working with the National Police Service and the National Police Service Commission were it not for the interferences by Kibicho."There is nothing difficult at all but it is this interference by the Interior Ministry and not from the cabinet secretary [Joseph Nkaiserry] but bureaucrats in the ministry. There is an excellent relationship between the IPOA and Nkaiserry as an individual and myself," Njeru said."Every time we want to speak with the CS concerning any issue, he is quick to listen to us and respond quickly, positively."Njeru said both president Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto have been supportive of the authority.He also said the IPOA has no problem working with Nkaiserry and the CS is among those who have lodged complaints with the authority.The chairman said problem lies with the PS and other bureaucrats in the ministry."The question we have posed to the PS is: when you are defending and fighting for the interests of NPS and you are busy castigating the IPOA....as the ministry isn't it your responsibility to make sure that you look at the interest of both institutions - the NPS and also IPOA?" "It is the responsibility of the ministry to ensure that they also look at the interest of the public because the IPOA represents the public."Njeru said interferences by the Ministry of Interior bureaucrats re to blame for the frosty relationship between the authority and the police. He said if the institutions- IPOA, NPS and the National Police Service Commission are left on their own, are able to sit down and arrive at a common ground without the derailment by the PS. "With the current IG we all agree that we need to deal with the rogue police officers so we are arriving at a consensus. But NPS is being derailed by the PS. Those power games are the problem because they [police] keep getting derailed," Njeru said. "Without unnecessary interference it is not difficult for IPOA, NPS and NPSC to sit down and work together in harmony."There was a proposed amendment to the IPOA Act to deny it unlimited access to information, evidence and material held by police necessary for IPOA functions which were dropped by the National Assembly.The amendments would have required the authority to comply with procedures of acquiring any such details or summoning a police officer both serving or retired, to appear during its investigations.The amendments would have reduced the IPOA to a subservient of the NPS operating at the mercy of IG because it would be unable to obtain any information, document they need from police or access police facilities without the permission of the IG.
