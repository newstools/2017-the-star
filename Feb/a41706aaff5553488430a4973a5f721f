Treasury CS Henry Rotich is expected before a parliamentary committee today to present his submission on proposed law seeking to seal loopholes on managing and regulating gambling. National Assembly&rsquo;s Labour and Social Welfare has invited Rotich and Kenya Revenue Authority commissioner general John Njiraini to give their views on the Betting, Lotteries and Gaming (Amendment) Bill, 2016. The committee chaired by Matungu MP David Were was tasked to make changes to the Bill for consideration after Parliament in August last year shot down a motion to set up an 11-member select committee to probe &ldquo;dubious practices&rdquo; in the multi-billion shilling betting and gambling industry.MPs questioned the &ldquo;motive&rdquo; of the team in rejecting the committee to be co-chaired by National Assembly deputy minority leader Jakoyo Midiwo and majority leader Aden Duale.Speaker Justin Muturi directed Were&rsquo;s committee to invite groups disatisfied with laws regulating the industry to submit their proposals to be included in the Bill before the House embarks on a debate.Midiwo also Gem MP, the sponsor of the defeated motion, is still pushing for the government to own gambling industry and all betting platforms to curb tax evasion, money laundering and managed according to recognised international practices.Some of betting platforms in the market Midiwo wants monitored closely and regulated are SportPesa, Betway, Betin Kenya and mCheza, on grounds they pose &ldquo;a serious economic threat.&rdquo; &ldquo;If we do not control or act on gambling, it will destroy this country. It is an interesting animal and form of corruption we should deal with,&rdquo; he said. On January 27, the Gem MP told the committee that licences issued to foreigners, including Chinese and Bulgarians, running betting firms in the country should be revoked because this violates the Constitution.&ldquo;We have proposed in this law that no foreigner can own a gambling licence in Kenya. The Constitution prohibits us from holding foreign accounts, hence the state should run gambling platforms,&rdquo; he said while presenting his proposals.Midiwo also wants communication companies offering betting platforms to foreign firms such as Safaricom scrutinised. He said they are contributing to loss of jobs through gambling and banking.
