Gretsa University yesterday defended Mombassa Governor Hassan Joho&rsquo;s degree. He graduated last December.The university said Joho is a qualified student, despite spirited efforts by some Jubilee politicians to discredit the degree.The institution denied claims by ODM politicians that it is being pressured by government to withdraw the degree.&ldquo;Late last month, the university underwent a quality audit by the Commission for University Education that was being undertaken simultaneously in all the 70 public and private universities in Kenya,&rdquo; vice chancellor Kuria Thuo said.Joho has been at loggerheads with the Jubilee government, which has levelled numerous allegations against him as it struggles to wrestle the Coast from the opposition.Coast is one of Cord&rsquo;s strongholds. Thuo said the exit report by CUE indicated the university has complied with the set standards and guidelines.He said Joho was a duly registered student, who studied Bachelor of Commerce. The County boss specialised in human resource management through the distance learning mode for three years since 2014. Thuo said he graduated after satisfying the board of examiners and senate, as is a requirement for graduation in all universities.&ldquo;Gretsa has not received any harassment or instruction from anyone to cancel any of our graduates&rsquo; degrees,&rdquo; Thuo told the Star. &ldquo;As a university committed to quality education, we only admit and graduate candidates who have satisfied the requirements for our various programmes.&rdquo;Joho, who has often given President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto a tongue-lashing, said during his latest press conference votes lie with the people, not agencies.
