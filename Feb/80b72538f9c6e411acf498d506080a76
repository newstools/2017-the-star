He singled out ravaging drought, overgrazing and constrained resources as among activities affecting forest cover.Mugo said KFS will take over seedling management in the co-managed seedling bed improve wood quality.He said TMA and KFS will continue to work together to ensure forest cover is not exhausted. He said it is wise for TMA to continue to invest in seedling production to ensure continuous supply of seedlings.TMA national chairman Benard Gitau said they have embraced discipline to ensure forests remain stable.He said as an association, they have had challenges of membership contribution, hence, the few constraints in carrying out their work.The chairman said next to the bed with 2.5 million seedlings in Londiani, they have been allocated a separate space that will produce 4.5 seedlings next year.He said TMA members have come to understand that apart from cutting down mature trees, they have an obligation to plant new ones to ensure the required 10 per cent forest cover is realised.
