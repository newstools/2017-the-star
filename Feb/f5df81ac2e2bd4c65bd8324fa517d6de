Bungoma 'moneybags' Moses Nandalwe has lashed out at Bumula MP Boniface Otsiula, saying he has no mandate to speak for the Luhya community. He dismissed the MP for claiming that Luhyas will unanimously vote for Jubilee is Raila Odinga is NASA flagbearer.Nandalwe said Otsiula's views are individual and do not represent those of Luhyas and Western residents.Otsiula said on Thursday that the community will only vote for the Opposition if ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi or Ford Kenya's Moses Wetang'ula are on the ticket."If none of our brothers is the opposition flag bearer, let no one come to Western and tell us to vote for Raila. We will be very bitter," he said on Wednesday.He noted Luhyas have been voting for Raila since 2007 and are yet to have a victory, and added that it is Raila's turn to return the favour by backing a candidate from the community in the August 8 polls.More on this: Luhyas will unanimously vote for Jubilee if Raila is NASA flag bearer - MP OtsiulaBut Nandalwe said, "Luhyas have an official spokesperson who is none other than Musalia Mudavadi who has now been mandated to speak on behalf of the community."He told the Star on phone that Otsiula, who is a Jubilee MP, should not talk about opposition business."Otsiula knows very well that his re-election on Jubilee party is worrying and he should concentrate on how he is going to solve that since he knows Jubilee is not accepted in Western," Nandalwe said.He said elected leaders in Western who defected to Jubilee will not be voted back in since the region is an opposition stronghold.Nandalwe, who ditched Wetang'ula's Ford Kenya for ODM, is perceived to be the front runner in the Sirisia parliamentary seat.Early this week, opposition leaders unveiled a 12-member team to officially register the National Super Alliance and name its presidential candidate.The team led by Siaya Senator James Orengo will also work on the coalition's instruments.Mudavadi allayed fears that those eyeing the super coalition's presidential ticket will lose out after a candidate is nominated for the August 8 general election.More on this: NASA will take care of all Opposition leaders, Mudavadi says amid fallout fears
