The Kenya Forest Service has warned residents near Mt Kenya and the Aberdare Forest against lighting fires that could become devastating wildfires.The risk of forest fires is at its highest during the prolonged drought. Last month, more than 17,000 acres of forest were destroyed by fire in the Aberdares.Nyeri ecosystem conservator Muchiri Mathinji said all departments have been put on alert to deal with any forest fire.He was speaking at Kahurura Forest on Tuesday during a meeting with Mt Kenya West Forest Association members on how to prevent and fight fires.&ldquo;Residents who graze, extract honey and farm should always be on the lookout while in the forests and report any sighting of smoke to authorities,&rdquo; Mathinji said.He said all KFS officers on leave have been recalled to assist in educating Community Forest Associations in how to stop and extinguish fires.Other organisations have been involved. Mathinji said it is a lie that burning forests bring rains. He said fires cause massive destruction that take ages to recover from.Mathinji said the region has not received rain from September last year, adding that the alert season could extend until March. Mt Kenya West CFA chairman Kariuki Mugo said the forest users have worked with KFS in the past and will continue doing so.Mugo said no fire has been reported in Mt Kenya this season. He said CFA members have a responsibility of protecting forests. The meeting was also used to encourage the members to register as voters before the deadline next Tuesday. Politicians have been criss-crossing the county, urging Kenyans to registers as voters in large numbers.
