An Ol kalou cleric has praised the Jubilee administration for the construction of the standard gauge railway and connecting millions of Kenyans to electricity.Bishop Francis Karara of the Holy Temple of the Lord Christ yesterday said these, among other development projects, have and will continue improving &lsquo;Wanjiku&rsquo;s&rsquo; life for the years.The standard gauge railway, he said, will make transportation of people and goods from Mombasa to Kisumu easy and at a reasonable cost.He said Kenyans pay Sh1,000 to travel for eight hours from Nairobi to Mombasa by bus, but the railway will reduce the time to two hours at a cost of Sh400.&ldquo;Some people said the railway is a wastage of public money. But I want to thank the President for staying put and carrying on despite criticism,&rdquo; he said.The average bus fare from Nairobi to Mombasa is between Sh1000-Sh3,000 by road.In 2011, following a feasibility study for the SGR, the proposed fare from Nairobi to Mombasa was estimated at Sh4,500 and time for the journey at four hours. But reports indicate that the proposed fare was rejected by the Kenya Railways Corporation for being unattainable.Yesterday, Karara said Kenyans are now able to access electricity at low cost, compared to when one had to pay &ldquo;Sh400,000 to get connected&rdquo;.More than 4.8 million Kenyans have been connected to electricity, a huge increase from 2.26 million who were connected when the Jubilee administration took over leadership in 2013.Although the petroleum prices keep fluctuating now and then, the cleric said the UhuRuto administration has worked to ensure this does not hurt the common mwananchi or derail development.Under the UhuRuto administration, traders also no longer hoard goods expecting to make a kill later, as no one is able to predict what will rise or fall, he said.&ldquo;This was only possible during the reign of founding President Jomo Kenyatta when consumer goods were always available at reasonable prices,&rdquo; Karara said.&ldquo;UhuRuto is a administration that cares for Wanjiku and Kenyans should unite and vote them back,&rdquo; he said.
