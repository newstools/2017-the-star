They have been there supporting me since I begun playing for them in 2012 and it will be unfair to them if I ditch them at the time of their need,&rdquo; said Mwanahalima, who cleared fourth form last year at St. John&rsquo;s Kaloleni.The diminutive striker had a splendid year in 2016, leading St. John&rsquo;s Kaloleni to claim the national school games football title and went ahead to finish second during the East African Secondary School Games. She said she owes her steady rise in the football to her coach Joseph Oyoo.&ldquo;I was privileged to play for the women&rsquo;s national team in some of the International assignments and at the same time missed some due to school commitment and the experience was amazing. But now that I have cleared my &lsquo;O&rsquo; level, am looking forward to give my services freely whenever I am called upon,&rdquo; said Mwahalima. The striker said they hope to perform well in the league this time after a poor show last year.Besides Mwanahalima, Winnie Achieng, Valery Marisa, Fatima Haya and Alice Mruu have all cleared school and are now committed to the club.She continued: &ldquo;I hope the league reverts to the unified system as opposed to zones to enable us play as many matches as possible.&rdquo;
