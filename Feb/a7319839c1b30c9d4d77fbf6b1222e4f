ODM has asked Coast regional coordinator Nelson Marwa to keep off politics and stick to serving in his capacity as a civil servant.Secretary for political affairs Opiyo Wandayi told off Marwa for allegedly saying that ODM intends to rig the August 8 polls at the Coast.On Friday, Marwa also claimed that ODM rigged the 2013 polls in order to win top seats at the Coast.He said the government is aware of schemed ODM is employing to ensure this year's general election is rigged in their favour.&ldquo;We have intelligence reports showing youth from a certain political coalition hang around registration centres. "They steal voters&rsquo; information and in the evening you get a text message congratulating you for joining ODM,&rdquo; Marwa said.More on this: ODM plans to rig polls as it did in 2013 to win top Coast seats &ndash; MarwaBut Wandiyi dismissed Marwa's 'wild allegations'."We wish to refer Marwa to his job description as a public servant in the moribund and cloned provincial administration. Meddling in party politics is clearly not one of them," Wandayi said in a statement on Saturday.He asked Marwa to resign from his post in the government and try his luck in politics before the February 7 deadline where civil servants seeking political posts should have resigned."Marwa is advised that if he is itching to throw his hat in the political ring, as he obviously appears inclined, the window is still open till Tuesday 7th of February. "We would love to meet him in field but he should know that one cannot be a tennis player - a no-contact sport - and stray into a game of rugby," Wandayi added.
