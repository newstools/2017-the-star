The Communications Authority of Kenya on Wednesday donated computers to St Mary&rsquo;s Kibabii Boys High School, Bungoma. It gave 50 desktop computers, three printers, two projectors, two projector screens and two laptops as well as internet connectivity for one year. Director general Francis Wangusi said young people should acquire ICT skills at a young age to keep with the information revolution."It goes without saying that individuals with basic ICT skills are likely to have better opportunities in the cut-throat competitive job market," he said. Broadcasting and Telecommunications PS Sammy Itemere said, "It is expected that access to ICTs will contribute to the country&rsquo;s economic growth by reducing transaction costs, increasing business efficiency, improving educational standards and ensuring accountability on the part of government officials."
