Embu Governor Martin Wambora and Senator Lenny Kivuti have opposed the appointment of speaker Kariuki Mate as Jubilee Party director of operations.Yesterday, they said since he is Runyenjes MP Cecily Mbarire&rsquo;s campaign manager and will help rig the governor nominations in her favour. Wambora, Kivuti and Mbarire want to run for Embu governor.But Mate has denied holding such a position. He told the Star he has only volunteered to mobilise Embu voters for the party and the President.Mate asked the leaders to drop their &ldquo;crybaby&rdquo; tendencies and brave the party primaries.Wambora and Kivuti have not been seeing eye-to-eye. They disagreed on a list of interim JP officials and have even opened parallel offices for the party. Wambora and Mbarire were in the same camp.In a rare show of unity that surprised many, Wambora, Kivuti and Mbeere North legislator Charles Njagagua flew from Wilson Airport to Embu University in Kivuti&rsquo;s helicopter to address the Mate issue.They were driven in the governor&rsquo;s official car to join JP aspirants at a press conference. The leaders said that if Mate remains JP director of operations he is likely to rig in Mbarire during primaries. After the press briefing, Kivuti was escorted back to the university in a county government vehicle.
