Nairobi will host 11 countries during the ITTF-ATTF Eastern region meeting tomorrow at Parklands Sports Club. Kenya table Tennis Association (KTTA) president, Andrew Mudibo, said the meeting focus will at length on the development agenda, which has been wanting in the region over the past few years.&ldquo;Member counties in the region will also discuss equipment distribution among other pressing issues which affect the sport regionally. Bringing in the requisite equipment for play has been quite a challenge when costs are factored in. Development has indeed been the key ingredient to success for the countries which have dominated the sport at global level. The essence during the meeting will be to explore ways and means through which we will steer the game to desirable heights,&rdquo; said Mudibo. Ethiopia, Madagascar, Mauritius, Rwanda, Somalia, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda and hosts Kenya have confirmed participation for tomorrow&rsquo;s event.&ldquo;As hosts, we are overly glad that this is the first time that the region is coming together to chart the way forward. Top on the agenda will be regional development events,&rdquo; said Mudibo. He said participants for the event will arrive in Nairobi today well in time for the event.
