Health CS Cleopa Mailu has advised the doctors&rsquo; union to appeal the jailing of their officials and resume negotiations. Only two issues are still in contention. They are pay increase and post-graduate training, where medics demand universities should award them 400 scholarships every year, paid for by the state. &ldquo;I will be meeting all the doctors to ensure we end this stalemate one by one,&rdquo; Mailu said at Afya House yesterday. He said the government regrets the decision made by the court to jail doctors&rsquo; union officials for one month after they failed to call off their strike. Mailu said he is optimistic an agreement would have been reached last Friday had doctors accepted the government&rsquo;s offer. &ldquo;Let me make it clear that doctors were not jailed for fighting for their rights. This is about their contempt-of-court case,&rdquo; Mailu said. The doctors&rsquo; union says its negotiating team and the government had settled on 97 per cent of all demands and only two items remained before the officials were jailed. &ldquo;As early as 1am today, we gave them our proposal but we haven&rsquo;t gotten a counter-proposal. If we had a few more days, we would have ironed this out,&rdquo; union&rsquo;s chief negotiator Alex Muturi said. Kenya National Human Rights Commission boss Kagwiria Mbogori said most of the CBA was agreed on. She said the parties had also drafted the recognition agreements to be signed with the counties.
