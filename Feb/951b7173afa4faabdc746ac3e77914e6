Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen has been accused of fawning sycophancy and failing to use his closeness to President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto to end banditry and poverty in the county. Former National Water Conservation and Pipeline Corporation director John Kangogo on Thursday said he resigned to run because the senator has been a letdown to his people.&ldquo;He has been close to power and is well connected. All that has been to his own benefit,&rdquo; he said. Kangogo will first square it off with Murkomen for the JP ticket.But in a quick rejoinder, Murkomen said the claims are unfounded, adding that he has delivered on all the promises he made before the 2013 election.&ldquo;Let them speak about what they have done and our people will decide based on our track record,&rdquo; he said.Murkomen&rsquo;s meetings in the Kerio Valley have been disrupted several times, as residents cite government&rsquo;s failure to end attacks.Kangogo said Murkomen has been in a position to find solutions to residents&rsquo; problems. &ldquo;It was a mistake to elect Murkomen. Residents should not repeat it,&rdquo; he said.Kangogo said the banditry problem in the Kerio Valley would have been resolved if leaders, led by Murkomen, dialogued with all communities.&ldquo;We require fresh leadership so we can work for solutions like creating a conservancy to separate communities in the bandit-prone areas,&rdquo; he said in Kipsoen village, where he declared his candidacy. Kangogo urged the government to stop the conflicts.
