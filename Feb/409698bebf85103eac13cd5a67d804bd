The country&rsquo;s manufacturing sector is still grappling with high cost of power which has pushed up the cost of production, denying Kenyans low commodity prices, sector&rsquo;s lobby group has said.The Kenya Association of Manufacturers says local industries are paying higher tarrifs compared to neighbouring countries, making locally produced goods uncompetitive.This is pushing Kenyan goods off the shelves in favour of cheap imports from both regional and international markets, denying local industries revenues.This, KAM says has left local manufacturers struggling to meet their production costs which is passed to consumers, a move that has also slowed down the sector&rsquo;s growth.According to the association, Kenyan manufactures are paying an electricity tariff of $15 cents (Sh15 ) per kilowatt hour, compared to Ethiopia where sector players are paying as low as $0.4 (Sh4.14 ) per kilowatt hour. Electric tariffs in Egypt and Uganda are $0.6 (Sh6) and $12 (Sh12) per kilowatt hour. Tanzania recently reduced its tariffs to $14 cents (Sh14 ) while South Africa manufacturers are paying $0.9 (Sh9) per kilowatts hour.&ldquo;When a manufacturer comes here (Kenya) the first thing they ask is what your tariffs are. Energy is a critical ingredient for manufacturing and a catalyst for increased industrial growth, job creation and revenue diversfification,&rdquo; KAM chairlady Flora Mutahi said.The association says the country&rsquo;s products can only become competitive if electricity tarrifs go to an average $0.9 (Sh9 ) per kilowatt hour. KAM CEO Phyllis Wakiaga said though the government has reduced the cost from $21(Sh21) ,more needs to be done.&ldquo;We are competing in a global environment where certain countries that are our close competitors have lower tariffs than we do,&rdquo; she said.Manufacturers have been on the spot for failing to lower cost of goods made in Kenya despite the government having reduced the cost of power.Wakiaga however said the industries are affected by other factors such as taxes and regulatory frameworks, which have failed to protect local manufacturers. They include Venue Added Tax and import duties.&ldquo;You find the finished product is coming in duty free, free of VAT but what is locally manufactured has 16 per cent VAT,&rdquo; she said.In a Thursday meeting with manufacturers last Thursday, Kenya Power acting CEO Ken Tarus said Ethiopia is enjoying low tariffs since its entire energy is from hydropower, unlike Kenya which depends on a mix including the expensive thermal generation. He said the country is expecting to receive 400megawatts of hydro-power from Ethiopia by 2019, in a power purchase agreement deal. &ldquo;That will be the cheapest power to get into our grid and once we get that, we expect further to reduce the cost of power,&rdquo; Tarus said.In 2015, the Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry and KAM warned that Kenya could lose local industries to Ethiopia, which has positioned itself as an attractive investment destination for manufactures due to affordable electricity.
