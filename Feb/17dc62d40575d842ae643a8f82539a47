Governors in Nyanza counties have started creating loose alliances of elected leaders to fend off strong opposition from aspirants.County elections are influenced and determined by regional balancing, clan dynamics and consolidating maximum support from backyards and swing regions. In Kisumu, Governor Jack Ranguma, who hails from the populous Kano clan, enjoys the support of Muhoroni MP James Oyoo. His clan mate and Nyando MP Fred Outa, who will vie for the county Senate seat, threw his support on his rivals.Outa is backing Kisumu Senator Anyang Nyong&rsquo;o from Seme, who seeks to replace Ranguma in the polls. Ranguma has managed to get support from the Nyakach clan from MP Aduma Owuor and Kisumu West legislator Olago Aluoch, to try and consolidate Kisumu clan members.
