The influx of more than 100,000 refugees into Kakuma Camp in the past five years has helped to stimulate the economy of Turkana county, the World Bank has said.However, the global financial institution says the refugee impact is still minimal and concentrated spatially and temporarily, with certain characteristics of the economy aggravating or mitigating it. The World Bank estimates indicate the refugees have boosted the county&rsquo;s gross regional product by more than three per cent and increased employment by about three per cent.This growth has an overall beneficial and permanent effect on Turkana&rsquo;s economy, World Bank said in a research paper &ndash; In My Backyard? The Economics of Refugees and Their Social Dynamics in Kakuma, Kenya. Apurva Sanghi, the lead economist and task team leader, said the refugees have increased consumption, self-reported incomes and asset ownership of Turkana community. &ldquo;For example, consumption measures within five kilometres of the camp are up to 35 per cent higher than in other parts of the county.Residents who live close to the camp tend to have higher income and assets (Kakuma residents are four times more likely to own a bicycle than non-Kakuma residents),&rdquo; he said during the launch of the report in Nairobi. Kakuma was established in 1991.
