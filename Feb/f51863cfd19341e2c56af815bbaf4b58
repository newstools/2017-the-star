With only nine days to go before the end of the final national mass registration of voters for the 12th General Election, the numbers are still way below target &ndash; everywhere. The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission started this final drive on January 16 with a national target of 6 million new voters to the nearest round figure. Today there are barely 1.5 million new voters, or about 30 per cent of target.Even in the best-performing counties, in Northeastern and Central, only 30 per cent of projected new voters have been registered.This is preposterous. Kenyans are still turning out in large numbers to, for instance, urge on Cord to transform itself into NASA, but little thought is spared for how to get the new outfit into power.The IEBC has evinced little sign of civic education or other innovative methods of getting Kenyans to register to vote. There should have been roadshows with blaring music and exhortations to get out and register.
