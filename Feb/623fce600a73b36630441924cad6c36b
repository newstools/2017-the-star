The first two legs of the Kenya Volleyball Federation national league which were scheduled for Busia and Laikipia County have been moved to Nyeri and Muranga counties respectively.The first leg, which was set for Malaba has been moved to Kamukunji grounds on March 3-5 while the second leg which was set for Nanyuki, will now be staged at the Ndakaini, Thika on April 28-30. KVF chairman Waithaka Kioni confirmed the new development, saying the changes were due to various reasons.Kioni, said the first leg/KVF Challenge Cup will be sponsored by the federation while the second leg dubbed &lsquo;Nairobi Water Chairman&rsquo;s Cup&rsquo; has been sponsored by the Nairobi Water Company.&ldquo;As we are aware, the Busia tournaments in the previous years have always been funded by Teso Member of Parliament, Arthur Odera. But knowing very well this is an election year, he might be having a lot on his plate and therefore we won&rsquo;t be having the league there but we hope to return there in subsequent years,&rdquo; said Kioni .He continued: &ldquo;We had a successful meeting with management of Water Company and we saw it right to have the second leg matches moved to Ndakaini. And with Nairobi Water coming on board and being the first company to sponsor one of the league tournament, we remain grateful to them and we hope more companies will come on board as we remain open to such offers.&rdquo;The official also revealed that plans are in top gear to have one of the league matches return to Bungoma County, where he said most of previous and now top management and most coveted players come from.He said: &ldquo;We have and still consulting with Michezo Africa to have one of the legs to be hosted in Bungoma. It&rsquo;s on record, for instance, former national team players and KVF management ranging from now the MP for Webuye East Dan Wanyama, former KVF chairman Alfred Khangati and now KVF 1st vice chairman Martin Makokha come from the region. And our plan to have the event there is to foster relationship and also as a show of appreciation.&rdquo;
