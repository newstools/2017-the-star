Political seats in Mombasa county might be shared equally among all parties affiliated to NASA, a senator aspirant has said.Ford Kenya secretary general Yasser Bajaber said if all parties come to an agreement, they will be fielding a single candidate in every seat to face it off with their opponents.&ldquo;We are on the verge of agreeing on how to divide the seats among all the parties, which will make it easy for us to win,&rdquo; he said.In the March 4, 2013, election, Ford Kenya did not field any candidate in the county's top positions.Bajaber said Ford Kenya wants to field candidates for senator, to MPs and 10 MCAs.Currently, ODM holds Likoni, Kisauni and Mvita MP posts, governor and woman representative seats, while Wiper party holds Jomvu, Changamwe and Nyali MP posts and the senator position.Ford Kenya seems not to be keen in forwarding an aspirant for governor and is likely to support incumbent Hassan Joho.If the deal pushes through, then parties affiliated to NASA will only have to worry about an opponent from the Jubilee Party.However, on Sunday in Mshomoroni, Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka gave strong indications that the party will field a candidate against ODM's Joho.Wiper treasurer Hezron Awiti (Nyali MP) and secretary general Hassan Omar (Mombasa senator) want to run for governor.
