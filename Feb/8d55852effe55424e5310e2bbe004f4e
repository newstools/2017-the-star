The government resumes salary talks with striking doctors today but there is disquiet among other cadres of health workers who feel doctors have been favoured. The talks, mediated by the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights and the Law Society of Kenya, will mainly focus on salaries and allowances, and training for doctors. The government offered a 40 per cent pay rise, giving interns Sh208,000 monthly pay, while the doctors union demanded Sh325,000 for interns and Sh1 million for consultants. This would create a huge pay disparity with other health workers, including nurses, clinical officers and technicians employed by the counties. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t understand how a doctor gets a Sh80,000 call allowance to go for an operation, while a specialist anesthetist, who is a clinical officer, gets only Sh10,000 yet they are doing the same operation,&rdquo; Kenya Union of Clinical Officers&rsquo; deputy secretary general Austin Otieno said. He said other medical officers are not against doctors, and hope the government will reach an agreement with the doctors&rsquo; union. &ldquo;We have our own set of needs in the memorandum we signed with the Council of Governors, and this will be incorporated into our CBA,&rdquo; Otieno said. Clinical officers also feel unfairly treated because while medical interns will earn about Sh208,000 a month, the diploma clinicians are paid nothing, while degree holders earn about Sh30,000 a month.
