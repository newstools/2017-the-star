Failure to taste the presidency, uncertainty about the NASA flag bearer candidate and poor coordination is to blame for the low voter turnout in Western, leaders and analysts say.While some say the apathy is because the region has never tasted power, others say the Western community is simply reluctant to exercise its civic right.Only 185,683 new voters had been listed in the region in the third week, against the IEBC&rsquo;s target of 1.1 million new voters by week four.Analyst Martin Andati yesterday said the strategy employed by leaders in mobilising residents to come out and register is wrong.Leading political luminaries from both NASA and Jubilee have been traversing the country to convince potential voters to register ahead of the August 8 polls.The final mass voter registration ends on Tuesday. &ldquo;You cannot run around in rallies and assume residents will, during the rallies or thereafter, register because people who attend those rallies are already registered. You need to engage volunteers to go and profile the potential voters and ensure they list,&rdquo; Andati said.He, however, said the narrative that Jubilee's perceived strongholds have listed more numbers is a fallacy.&ldquo;Opposition areas have a higher number of targeted voters than Jubilee zones and the percentages of new voters captured cannot therefore compare directly,&rdquo; Andati said.Funyula MP Paul Otuoma said because Western residents "have yet to taste the presidency, they still do not understand their civic rights".&ldquo;We&rsquo;re struggling as leaders but the efforts we put in are watered down by petty issues like demands for handouts by residents before listing as voters. The people still do not understand it is their legal right to participate in democratic processes and this is quite disappointing,&rdquo; he said.Otuoma said the IEBC should adopt friendly methods that that will reduce bureaucracies in registration. He suggested that voter listing should be done together with ID cards when one attains the mandatory age of 18.&ldquo;The government should simplify the procedures towards facilitating participation in electoral processes. As leaders from this region, we have a burden to continue creating awareness even after the exercise to ensure our people understand their civic rights and how they impact on their lives,&rdquo; he said.Kakamega Senate hopeful Cleophas Malala said the perceived low voter registration is a creation by Jubilee to project opposition areas as lacking numbers to beat them in August.&ldquo;There is nothing like slow registration. It&rsquo;s a strategy generated and being spiraled by Jubilee to brainwash Kenyans that opposition lacks numbers so that the same can justify their stealing of the election,&rdquo; he said.He said deliberate retention of IDs in areas perceived to be hostile to Jubilee has hurt registration.Malala said Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula has done little in mobilising residents to register. &ldquo;Only ANC&rsquo;s Musalia Mudavadi has a programme running on the ground where co-ordinators have been named to profile the potential voters to list,&rdquo; he said.Political analyst Martin Oloo said that there was not apathy in the region. He said that residents are reluctant to exercise their civic duty by registering as voters and voting during elections.&ldquo;Luhyas are not fools. They are clever but applies their intelligence in the negative direction. They have refused to work hard and wait to be given handouts before registering and even voting. They have reversed the roles such that people elect themselves instead of them electing leaders,&rdquo; he said.
