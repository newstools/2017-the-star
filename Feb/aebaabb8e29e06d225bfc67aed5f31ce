The Agriculture ministry will introduce a tracing system to stop coffee theft. CS Willy Bett yesterday said coffee millers are to blame for the rampant coffee theft in parts of Nyeri, Kisii, Bungoma and Murang&rsquo;a counties. He said farmers have in the past one year lost 465 bags of clean coffee worth about Sh10 million. &ldquo;The government will withdraw licences of millers and marketers implicated in coffee theft. There is no way these coffee value-chain players can exonerate themselves from blame. Stolen beans from cooperative societies end up with them before export,&rdquo; Bett said. Industry players, who sought anonymity, confirmed that coffee is stolen by cartels of prominent personalities, security officials and unscrupulous traders, with the help of coffee cooperative officials.Bett said, &ldquo;Unethical trade behaviour is contributing to the grinding poverty farmers are reeling from. The theft is a well-coordinated game.&rdquo;
