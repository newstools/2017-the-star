Some passenger vehicles in Lamu, especially shuttles, are leaving the area early without undergoing security checks or having police escorts, endangering passengers&rsquo; lives, county commissioner Joseph Kanyiri has said.Drivers of such vehicles will be arrested for contempt of the law and putting people&rsquo;s lives at risk, he said.&ldquo;If you are travelling out and into Lamu by road, it will be in your own best interest to use a vehicle that has police escort. However much shuttles will promise you an earlier arrival at your destination, such a move is very risky,&rdquo; Kanyiri told passengers.The decision for armed police escorts was introduced by Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery, following increased al Shabaab attacks on buses between 2014 and 2015.Businesswoman Julia Kamau, a frequent traveller, urged passengers to ensure security checks for their safety.
