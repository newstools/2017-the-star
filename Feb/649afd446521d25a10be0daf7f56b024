Farmers in Tharaka constituency are expecting a bumper harvest of sorghum, millet, pigeon peas and green grams, despite less rainfall, as they planted drought-resistant crops.The International Crop Research Institute for the Semi&ndash;Arid Tropics has been training the farmers to diversify from perennial crops such as maize to reduce hunger and poverty.The programme is called Accelerated Value Chain Development programme.ICRISAT breeding scientist Erick Manyasa said they have successfully trained farmers in Kitui, Makueni, Tharaka Nithi, Elgeyo Marakwet and Siaya.BUMPER HARVEST&ldquo;Farmers who have followed our tips, especially in Tharaka, are going to get a good harvest, as opposed to others,&rdquo; Manyasa said.He urged farmers in Tharaka to plant traditional crops that do well in harsh climate, such as millet and sorghum.The scientist said residents should be encouraged to consume these crops through value-adding them to products such as bread, noodles and cakes.He said they are working with the Kenya Agriculture and Livestock Research Organisation to produce drought-resistant seeds.&ldquo;We have also trained farmers on how to get farming tips to ensure they get a good harvest, even if the rains fail,&rdquo; Manyasa said.He said farmers who planted perennial crops such as maize did not get a good harvest due to poor rains that only lasted a month.BETTER YIELDSManyasa said in Chiakariga ward, which has 8,000 households and about 36,000 people, farmers planted 3,200 hectares of sorghum and expect to harvest 16 bags per hectare; millet 1,800 hectares, each to yield 10 bags; pigeon peas 1,600 hectares (each 5 bags), green grams 1,500 hectares (each three bags) and cow peas 250 hectares (each 5 bags).He said despite lower harvest than expected, farmers who planted maize on 1,800 hectares expect to harvest one bag per hectare, which is a very low return compared to traditional high yield crops.FOOD SECURITY&ldquo;This shows those who planted sorghum will benefit, as they will have more to sell than those who planted maize,&rdquo; Manyasa said.&ldquo;We want to emphasise that according to our research, farmers can use crops that withstand drought to enable food security.&rdquo;Harun Mbogo, an agriculture extension officer, said together with 750 farmers have benefited from the programme by receiving seeds of Gadam sorghum, green grams and finger millet.&ldquo;They are very receptive that the seeds have produced high yields and are climate-resilient,&rdquo; Mbogo said.MARKET ASSISTANCEMbogo said due to poor research on traditional high value crops, farmers were unable to get good harvests.He said they will link farmers to markets due to high demand for sorghum that produces KEG.The officer said traditional high-yield crops are of high nutrition compared to other crops.Sorghum trades at Sh50 per kilo, millet at Sh70, green grams at Sh80 and cow peas at Sh100, while maize retails at Sh15-Sh25 per kilo, meaning the farmers who planted traditional high yield crops are expecting to laugh all the way to the bank due to good prices in the market.&ldquo;Traditional high-yield crops are making profits more than coffee and tea. I encourage farmers to try them out as they are even cheap to maintain,&rdquo; Mbogo said.Ganga Rao, a principal scientist with ICRISAT, said many farmers in the county export pigeon peas to India, so producing high-yield crops is important.He said they will introduce a new variety of ground nuts that can grow in 120 days. He said the variety can do well in the area.Rao said they are training farmers on how to grow pigeon peas and chicken peas.
