Vihiga Queens women&rsquo;s football team coach Alex Alumira says his side will be under no pressure when they take on champions Thika Queens as the 2016 Women&rsquo;s Premier League (WPL) concludes today at the Camp Toyoyo grounds in Nairobi.The Vihiga based club which earned promotion to the Premier League from the National League last season topped zone &ldquo;B&rdquo; with 31 points to set up a final with champions Thika Queens who finished their zone &ldquo;A&rdquo; programme unbeaten with 32 points.&ldquo;Reaching the play-off stage alone is something to be proud off having debuted in the Premier League this season. We are aware they (Thika) are an experienced side but we have equally prepared well ahead of the clash and we will be going for the title,&rdquo; noted the tactician.He added: &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have pressure and we will take the tie just like any other match, however, we will approach them cautiously knowing very well they have good players who can cause upset at any given chance but all in all we are looking forward to a good match.&rdquo;The Vihiga-based side finished zone &ldquo;B&rdquo; ahead of Oserian ladies team who managed 28 points, while Thika outclassed the starstudded Spedag women&rsquo;s who bagged 29 points.Thika Queens are unbeaten in the league and have three national team regulars. These are Harambee Starlets captain and forward Mary Kinuthia and midfielders Christine Nafula and Mercy Achieng. Thika should thus give the side coached by Richard Kanyi an edge over their opponents.On the other hand, Vihiga Queens boast of forward Enez Mango and defender Maureen Ater who have earned national team call ups in recent days.
