Fuel prices for the next month ending March 14 have gone up by between Sh3.75 and Sh5.03 a litre, a development likely to push up the cost of basic goods and services. The Energy Regulatory Commission, the industry regulator, blamed the rise on higher global oil prices and depreciation in value of the shilling against the dollar. Diesel &ndash; largely used in transportation, farming and manufacturing &ndash; rose by the highest margin of Sh5.03 per litre. Motorists will Sh4.26 more for a litre of petrol in the next 30 days, while poor households who use kerosene for cooking and lighting will have to part with Sh3.75 more for every litre. &ldquo;The price of crude oil in the world markets recorded an increase of 20 per cent between November 2016 and January 2017. This led to an increase in the prices of refined products,&rdquo; newly-appointed ERC acting director general Pavel Oimeke. ERC said Murban crude oil rose 2.22 per cent month-on-month to average $55.35 (Sh5,749) per barrel in January from $54.15 (Sh5,625) in December. The shilling, on the other hand, exchanged at an average of 103.88 against the US dollar last month, a deprecation of 1.44 per cent from 102.41 in December. Kenya is a net importer of refined petroleum products since the closure of Kenya Petroleum Refineries in September 2013. Average cost of imported petrol increased by 8.45 per cent to $575.06 per tonne in January from $530.24 in December, the ERC said. Diesel increased by 12.07 per cent from $446.84 per tonne to $500.78, while Kerosene increased by 7.44 per cent from $487.91 per ton to $524.20 between December and January. &ldquo;The applicable pump prices have been impacted, primarily so because the petroleum cargoes used in this month&rsquo;s computation were procured in December 2016 and January 2017. It takes between 30 and 45 days between order placement and Cargo delivery,&rdquo; said Oimeke. Oimeke said that some of the issues he would be focusing on in his new position include the provision of cheaper energy, establishment of regional ERC offices in all 47 counties to enhance the regulator&rsquo;s efficiency in the country and working with the government and other stakeholders in the development of sustainable energy.
