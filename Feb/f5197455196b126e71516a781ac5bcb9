LPK leader Ababu Namwamba has dismissed claims he schemed the removal of former secretary general David Makali.Makali was on Friday stripped of his position for allegedly being too cozy with NASA, while the majority of the party NEC members are said to be inclined to Jubilee. He accused Namwamba and a section of the Jubilee Party officials of funding his removal.Speaking to the Star in Garissa on Saturday, Namwamba termed the allegations &ldquo;utter nonsense&rdquo;.&ldquo;Who is coming up with such allegations that I was given money, and by who? That is a nonissue that I am not willing to talk about. It is not what we came to do in Garissa,&rdquo; a visibly agitated Namwamba said.The LPK leader said the party&rsquo;s NEC will this week meet to discuss the matter, after which a decision will be made.
