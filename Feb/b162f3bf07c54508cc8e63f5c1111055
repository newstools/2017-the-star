Sikh Union&rsquo;s participation in the ongoing 2017 NPCA Twenty20 League hangs in balance following difference between the players and club management. The former finalists failed to honour their two matches against defending champions Swamibapa and Ruaraka last weekend over the same problems. The rift between the two sides is so deep that Sikh Union are for the second week likely to skip top of the bill matches against Stray Lions and Kanbis.The players have vowed not to honour their matches unless their grievances, among them contracts and allowances, are addressed.The players are also accusing the management of mistreating them and the technical bench. But in a rejoinder, the club chairman, Harbir Singh, accused the players and technical bench of spreading falsehoods via social media hence painting the club in bad light.&ldquo;There is more than what is being said out there. We have people in the team who have made the team their own because we had given them a free hand to run the team. But now because we are asking questions on some issues, we are being accused of not helping the team,&rdquo; Harbir said.In case Sikh Union doesn&rsquo;t honour their fixtures, Stray Lions and Kanbis will be granted walkovers that will boost their chances of qualifying for the next round of matches.Failure to play on Saturday could be a blessing in disguise for league leaders Stray Lions who will have a tough fixture the following day against defending champions and second-placed Swamibapa at Nairobi Jafferys. From nine round of matches, Stray Lions have garnered 42 points followed by second-placed Swamibapa, who have 34 points.
