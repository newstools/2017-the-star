Nyeri Governor Nderitu Gachagua, 64, died at 2.15am yesterday at the Royal Marsden Hospital in London while undergoing treatment for pancreatic cancer.His family was at his bedside.Gachagua was a man of nine lives like the proverbial cat and is the first governor to die in office.He has been ailing for two years and has missed most public events in Nyeri. Gachagua was not seen often in public, leading to speculations of ill health and rumours of his death.Most notably, he did not attend Madaraka Day celebrations on June 1 last year and Mashujaa Day celebrations on December 20 in Nyeri.He was last seen in Nyeri in November last year when President Uhuru Kenyatta was in Chaka, Kieni East, during the groundbreaking ceremony of the multimillion-shilling market.However, he seemed weak.Sources said the President told him to rest and not strain himself.In 2016, Gachagua was treated in India then moved to London.Ill health and death rumoursMany a time, rumours have hit Nyeri that he has died, only for him to resurface.Late last year, the county government was forced to issue a statement, dismissing rumours of his death after reports circulated on social media that he died on his way to a hospital in London.Despite his ill health, the governor would still handle county matters. He would even take to teleconferencing while in bed.Early this month, during a meeting for voter registration mobilisers, he said he will run for reelection.Gachagua said he will leave nothing to chance in the governor contest. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready for reelection. I&rsquo;m very much energised this time and you should disregard those saying I&rsquo;m not vying for the seat,&rdquo; he said on the phone.The governor warned Nyeri residents that they risk being marginalised by the Cord team if it wins this general election just because they failed to register as voters. He urged all adult residents to list as voters.Gachagua also promised to soon return to Nyeri so he can start the Jubilee Party member recruitment drive.Survived impeachment attemptIn September last year, 32 out of the 46 Nyeri county assembly members voted to impeach Gachagua on grounds of abuse of office, gross violation of the Constitution in procurement, gross misconduct and corruption in the county government.This marked the climax of wrangles that had been ongoing for years between the MCAs and the governor.At one time, the MCAs delayed the passing of the Sh6.4 billion budget for six months until the national government intervened.The Senate dismissed the impeachment motion.Although Gachagua had been working closely with Nyeri Senator Mutahi Kagwe, Nyeri MPs did not work with him &mdash; some could not even share a platform with him.Some Nyeri county executives faced corruption charges in court after the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission filed a case during his term.Gachagua was elected on the GNU ticket in the March 4, 2013, general election, despite the TNA wave in Central.He was Mathira MP in 2002-2007.Gachagua served as a principal quantity surveyor and chief quantity surveyor. He held a Bachelor of Arts degree in Building Economics from the University of Nairobi.
