Three elephant calves got stuck in mud at the drying Lake Kamnarok in Baringo county on Friday, where they went to drink water amid the drought.They were among more than 700 elephants that came from Rimoi Game Reserve across the neighbouring Elgeyo Marakwet county.Resident James Kibet said the animals arrived at about 7am."When they left, we saw the three calves struggling in vain to get out of the muddy lake. Their mothers also tried to help them but they couldn't," said Kibet.He said he asked other people to call Kenya Wildlife Service officers from both Baringo and Elgeyo Marakwet.The rescue that attracted more than 400 spectators ended at about 2.30pm."It was quite interesting that while the rescue team carried out operations to pull out the stuck calves, their mothers patiently waited, knowing their kids were being assisted," said Kibet.He said the animals later 'happily' walked to Tobus area near the lake.An elephant calf that got stuck in the muddy Lake Kamnarok in Baringo county while looking for water, February 10, 2017. /JOSEPH KANGOGOKatibel location chief James Kamuren said the lake's water level was dropping due to the "choking sun".Kamuren said the lake was the only source of water for people, livestock and wildlife in the two counties.He said it dried up completely in 2015, forcing the elephants to migrate to Rimoi conservancy, but that the Baringo government spent Sh10 million reviving it.Baringo KWS warden Dickson Too thanked residents for their "rare show of concern" and for immediately reporting the incident.Too said they rescued the calves without sedating them."Elephants have the rich history of not harming anyone without being provoked or intimidated," he said, and urged locals to accommodate harmless animals during the dry season.A parade of elephants that went from Rimoi Game Reserve to the drying Lake Kamnarok in Baringo county to look for water, February 10, 2017. /JOSEPH KANGOGOToo warned residents against cutting down trees saying this would make the lake dry up faster.He asked stakeholders and donors to contribute funds for fencing the water source.
