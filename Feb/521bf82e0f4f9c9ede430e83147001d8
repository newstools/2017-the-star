The Nairobi government has sued 68 landlords for discharging raw sewage into rivers, Environment executive Peter Kimori has said.Nairobi Water and Sewerage Company has also disconnected water supply to those landlords&rsquo; estate and blocked sewer lines discharging waste into rivers.&ldquo;About 40 have been concluded and they [landlords] are now coming to City Hall for fresh connection to the main sewer line,&rdquo; Environment executive Peter Kimori said.&ldquo;We are doing this [blocking sewer lines and disconnecting water] to make sure they go back into our main sewer instead of discharging into the river.&rdquo;He spoke on Tuesday during a visit to Kirichwa Kubwa River on Tuesday.Kimori said residential flats built next to the Kirichwa Ndogo and Kirichwa Kubwa rivers &mdash; mostly on riparian land and way leaves &mdash; discharge raw sewage into the rivers.He did not reveal the identities of the landlords or the estates affected, but said most of them are in Dagoretti.Kimori said the county is reviewing approvals for buildings put up on riparian land and reserves. He said all structures on riversbanks and way leaves will be brought down.The executive said encroachment and pollution are a threat to the existence of Nairobi rivers.&ldquo;So we are going back to look into the approvals on how these houses were approved, we will identify the owners, flats and definitely we will bring them down,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Riparian land is public space meant to make sure the river is not interfered with. I want to assure Nairobians that we are going to reclaim these lands.&rdquo; Unscrupulous City Hall officials have for years been blamed for approving construction of buildings on river banks and other public spaces. This has led to collapse of buildings, killing dozens of people.
