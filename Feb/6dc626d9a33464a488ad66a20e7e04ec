Transport PS John Mosonik has denied meddling in Bomet politics, sabotaging projects or endorsing aspirants.He said he tours the county to inspect projects because he wants it to get the best in development and those opposing his actions are enemies of development.&ldquo;I have not declared interest in any seat and these people making noise on my tours of the county should give me a break. I am a resident and I have the right to be in the county [as it is his home],&rdquo; Mosonik said.On February 14, Bomet Central MP Ronald Tonui accused him and other civil servants of frequenting the constituency and drumming up support for particular candidates. He also accused the PS of sabotaging his development projects.Governor Isaac Rutto has also accused Mosonik and Energy CS Charles Keter of engaging in politics.
