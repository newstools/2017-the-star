The Kiambu government's effort to revive village polytechnics and give young people soft loans for small businesses has enabled youths earn a living, social services executive Esther Ndirangu has said.Speaking in Kiambu yesterday, Ndirangu said 32 polytechnics have been equipped and rehabilitated."We have seen additional enrolment in these polytechnics for vocational training since Governor William Kabogo revived and equipped them. It has also eased the school-to-work transition for the many primary and secondary school leavers in Kiambu," she said.Ndirangu said the polytechnics offer technical courses driven by demand in the job market and most of the graduates are hired by partners of the county government."There is a lot of demand for technical jobs, which we haven't satisfied. Youths should to come and enrol for courses such as masonry, electrical engineering, hairdressing, baking and mechanics, among others.
