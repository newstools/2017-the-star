Cord leader Raila Odinga has expressed joy after the release of seven doctors' union officials from prison.A Court of Appeal earlier ruled for the immediate release of KMPDU doctors jailed on Monday. They were to serve a one-month sentence for contempt of court after refusing to end their strike that has lasted about 73 days now.The officials are chair Samuel Oroko, secretary general Ouma Oluga, treasurer Daisy Korir, deputy treasurer Evelyne Chege, Allan Ochanji, Mwachonda Chibandzi and Titus Ondoro."We welcome the decision of the court and urge the government to take appropriate steps to resolve all strikes currently ongoing with speed," he told journalists after the ruling on Wednesday.Striking doctors hold placards and chant slogans outside the Court of Appeal while waiting for a ruling on the imprisonment of KMPDU officials, February 15, 2017. /REUTERSThe Opposition leader blamed the government for the strike saying ithad dragged on for too long."It is a shame that this is happening in our nation. So many innocent Kenyans have died in hospitals for lack of treatment," he noted.He said the government has humiliated the doctors yet they deserve the best"."Jailing our doctors is dehumanising. It is not right to take doctors to Kamiti prison. It's a shame and Kenyans have a right to elect another government in 2017," he said.The ruling came after Raila accompanied his lawyers to the Supreme Court for an appeal.The strike has angered Kenyans and turned into a test of President Uhuru Kenyatta's leadership ahead of the August 8 polls.Read: Raila asks his lawyers to appeal 'disturbing' ruling that jailed doctorsA KMPDU representative addresses striking doctors outside the Court of Appeal where they were waiting for a ruling on the imprisonment of KMPDU officials, February 15, 2017. /REUTERSThe 5,000-member doctors' union wants the government to implement a deal agreed in 2013 to raise basic salaries by 300 per cent.Doctors are also calling for a review of working conditions, job structures, criteria of promotions and to address under-staffing in state hospitals.After failing to call off the strike that started on December 5, 2016, officials were ordered to serve a one-month jail term.Read: Oluga explains 'unfortunate' 65-day doctors' strike to SenateAlso read: Inside the striking doctors&rsquo; 2013 collective bargaining agreementStriking doctors hold placards and chant slogans outside the Court of Appeal while waiting for a ruling on the imprisonment of KMPDU officials, February 15, 2017. /REUTERSHealth CS Cleopa Mailu told the Senate Health committee on Tuesday that he could get doctors back on the negotiating table and ensure the crisis ends.He also said he will do anything possible to ensure doctors' union officials are released from prison.The CS accused Principal Secretary Nicholas Muraguri of insubordination saying he refused to take part in the talks.Read: Mailu accuses Muraguri of insubordination during talks to end doctors' strike
