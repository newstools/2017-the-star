Human rights defenders have warned the National Assembly against "mischievous" miscellaneous amendments to the IPOA Act to trim its powers.The Act gives IPOA power to summon police officers for grilling and demand any document, information or other material held by police, if relevant to investigations.But Parliament has proposed drastic amendments that would deny the authority power to summon police officers for grilling.The proposed Bill also denies IPOA unlimited access to documents and items held by police or their facilities.It requires the authority to comply with procedures of obtaining privileged information before demanding information, documents and items from police.Civil society organisations under the Police Reforms Working Group-Kenya warned Parliament on Thursday that the decision will limit the sharing of resources needed in investigations.Organisations under the PRWG include the Kenya Human Rights Commission, International Justice Mission and Shield for Justice and Usalama Reforms.Others are Kariobangi Paralegal, Amnesty International-Kenya, International Commission of Jurists- Kenya, Chemichemi Ya Ukweli and Independent Medico Legal Unit."We would like to remind the members of the National Assembly that the Evidence Act clearly provides the procedure of submitting privileged documents, thing or information," said IMLU executive director Peter Kiama."There is no justification for the proposed amendments in the Bill, nor any indications of the mischief it intends to cure."Read: Uhuru wants power to easily sack IPOA boardAlso read: Police accountability is an antidote to police brutalityKiama said the Independent Policing Oversight Authority must have the ability to interview all witnesses including police officers."It must have access to all relevant documents needed to complete its investigations in order to be effective and maintain the support of the people it serves," he said.Kiama noted that IPOA was a civilian authority created to handle public interest through views collected by Police Reforms Implementation Committee."It is therefore self-defeating to declare information shared with them as being protected by public interests," he said."The only way the authority can commence any investigations is through receipt of information from members of public and the National Police Service. If such information is not forthcoming, the work of the authority is effectively curtailed."Kiama further said the amendments lacked necessary threshold, were unmerited, irreconcilable with public interests and had potential to immobilise the authority.He urged the parliamentarians to uphold the constitution, resist attempts to introduce amendments aimed at satisfying individual egos rather than the greater public interest and reject the amendments.Among cases IPOA has looked into is the alleged police brutality during an operation to recover seven stolen firearms in Mumias.The authority asked residents to file official complaints at Christian Growth Church in Shibale Township from Wednesday to Friday.Members of the public who witnessed the alleged attacks or have information were also asked to go the church.IMLU said last November that they would ensure accountability and justice for all the victims of the brutality.More on this: IPOA begins probe on police brutality during Mumias weapons searchAlso read: IPOA wants two female cops tried for circulating minor's nude picturesAn IPOA probe found that police assaulted University of Nairobi students during persistent violent protests early in April last year.A video surfaced showing GSU officers beating the students amid protests against disputed union elections.
