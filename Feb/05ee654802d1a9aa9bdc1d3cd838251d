A high school principal has resigned to run for the Murang&rsquo;a Senate seat. Peter Njangi has taught for 34 years and was a principal for 28 years in several schools, the latest being Mutige Boys&rsquo; High School in Kirinyaga. He on Friday said the dismal performance of Murang&rsquo;a schools pushed him to run. Njagi said he will improve the county&rsquo;s education standards if elected.
