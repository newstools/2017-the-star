Coast regional coordinator Nelson Marwa (pictured) has accused some ODM politicians of planning to rig the August 8 election in Mombasa.Marwa said the government is well aware of the schemes ODM is employing to ensure the polls are rigged in their favour.Speaking in Miritini yesterdaty, he said ODM leaders rigged the 2013 election and they want to employ the same tactics in August.In the last election, all Mombasa elective seats &ndash; governor, senator, woman representative, MPs and MCAs &mdash; were won by ODM and Wiper, which are all under the Cord coalition. ODM clinched the governor&rsquo;s seat, four MPs seats, the woman representative and all 30 MCA seats. Wiper won the Senate and two MPs &mdash; Nyali and Jomvu seats. On Thursday, Marwa said Cord rigged the 2013 polls, in which Jubilee failed to clinch any single seat.Marwa said ODM officials have stationed youth at the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission registration centres to steal voters&rsquo; information. &ldquo;We have intelligence reports showing youth from a certain political coalition hang around registration centres. They steal voters&rsquo; information and in the evening you get a text message congratulating you for joining ODM,&rdquo; Marwa said.
