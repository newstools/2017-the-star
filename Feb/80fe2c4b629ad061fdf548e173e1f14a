Kenya Power chairman Kenneth Marende yesterday insisted he will run for Nairobi governor.He also said he has not joined either ODM or Jubilee. Marende said, however, he is still consulting on the party he will use.&ldquo;In my last tour of duty, I was the head of the Legislature, the second arm of the government. It does not therefore add up that I gun for the senator seat. I&rsquo;m a progressive man who looks up,&rdquo; he told the Star on the phone.There were reports NASA leaders have prevailed on Marende to drop his Nairobi top job bid in favour of Governor Evans Kidero. They were said to have urged him to run for the Senate seat. The former National Assembly Speaker said he will run for Nairobi governor last year, but did not state the party he will contest on.Last week, Marende met ODM leader Raila Odinga in Kisumu, sparking speculations that he might be rejoining the Orange party. Sources privy to the negotiations said picking Marende as NASA&rsquo;s candidate for Nairobi senator will consolidate the Luhya community support in the city.The Luhya community is the backbone of the alliance&rsquo;s voter strength.The alliance is under pressure to reward the community to continueenjoying its support. This will also ensure the community is solidly behind the alliance in the build up to the August 8 polls. &ldquo;The leaders feel that giving the [Senate] seat to Marende will ensure all the big communities share the political seats in Nairobi equally,&rdquo; an MP, who sought anonymity, said.ODM has declared Kidero the sole candidate, as no one submitted papers to challenge him for the party ticket as at the closure of submission of documents by aspirants last month.Already JP&rsquo;s foremost governor hopeful Peter Kenneth has hinted that former Town Clerk Philip Kisia, from the Luhya community, will be his running mate.
