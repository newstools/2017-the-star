CoG yesterday moved to court, seeking to overturn a law that bars politicians from defecting to another party after losing in the primaries.The county chiefs, in the urgent petition filed at the Milimani law courts, said denying political parties&rsquo; members the right to freely move from one outfit to another is unreasonable and unjustifiable. &ldquo;It is an affront to democracy and should be declared illegal,&rdquo; the document filed states.The Council of Governors have sued Attorney General Githu Muigai and the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission.They are seeking several orders, among them a declaration that section 28 of the Election Act 24 of 2011 is inconsistent with the Constitution and is therefore null and void.Their argument is that while party defections within nominations deadline may be revolting, every person has the right of association and freedom to make political choices as contained in the Constitution. &ldquo;The challenge to clean up the rot in Kenya&rsquo;s political party process cannot be realised through legislation that undermines other people&rsquo;s rights,&rdquo; the council says.CoG says the right of any politician to defect and join a party of his or her choice before the deadline set by the IEBC, should not be violated.&ldquo;The problem at hand is not party-hopping, but the practice of party politics in Kenya,&rdquo; the council says.It says that political parties are conduits for &ldquo;ascending to and consolidating tribal power&rdquo;, not based on any ideology.The law barring politicians from ditching parties after losing in the nominations has triggered a wave of defections countrywide.Aspirants are opting for smaller parties, where they are assured of direct nomination. In Busia, Governor Sospeter Ojaamong is already in talks with Ford Kenya officials to secure the party ticket, as competition for the ODM ticket intensifies. Funyula MP Paul Otuoma, himself the ODM vice chairperson, is seen as Ojaamong&rsquo;s closest competitor.Interestingly, Otuoma is also said to be in talks with ANC, where he would seek refuge in case the race for the ODM ticket becomes too arduous.
