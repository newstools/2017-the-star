Tension remains high in Kerio Valley after suspected Pokot bandits mounted twin attacks yesterday, barely two days after attacking a bus carrying mourners.The two simultaneous attacks broke out at 12.30pm in Kaben and Mogil.Kaben resident Wilson Kiptoo said about 100 Pokot attackers armed with AK47 rifles attacked Marakwet herders in Chepkorowo grazing field near the pasture-rich Kerio River.He said police reservists and local herders engaged in a fierce gun battle, repulsing the attackers. Kiptoo said one resident sustained serious gunshot wounds and was rushed to the nearby Tot Subcounty Hospital.&ldquo;The fighting is still going on. They have not taken livestock, but one person has been injured,&rdquo; he said.Kiptoo said women and children have fled the area.Marakwet East deputy county commissioner Eric Mulevu confirmed the attacks and said police officers in collaboration with reservists have launched a manhunt for the bandits.A gang of armed assailants killed one person on the Chesongoch-Liter road on Friday night after they opened fire on a bus carrying mourners and the body of a relative of former Inspector General David Kimaiyo.The attackers killed a pedestrian as they fled.On Saturday, armed bandits killed Loyamorok MCA Kibet Cheretei and Tiaty MP hopeful Simon Pepe Kitamba in Baringo county.Kimaiyo said banditry has turned into terrorism. He told the press in Iten al Shabaab terrorists may have infiltrated into remote areas, including parts of Baringo county, where they are disguising themselves as cattle rustlers.&ldquo;You never know how far these terrorists have moved. They must have moved to interior parts of the country. I can equate the nature of attacks going on Kerio Valley to that of al Shabaab terrorists,&rdquo; Kimaiyo said. He urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to order a probe into the attacks.&ldquo;It is not business as usual. This issue has turned into a terrorist attack,&rdquo; Kimaiyo said.
