The Labor committee chaired by Matungu MP David Were is collecting views from lawmakers, the Treasury, the Kenya Revenue Authority and the Interior ministry on how to regulate the multimillion-shilling gambling industry.Treasury CS Henry Rotich and PS Kamau Thugge are expected before the committee next week Tuesday to give their proposals. House deputy minority leader Jakoyo Midiwo proposes the government run all sports betting and gambling platforms to ensure taxes are remitted and to curb money laundering.He told the committee the gambling industry is characterised by serious and unlawful practices, harmful to the state and gamblers, due to loopholes in the laws regulating operations.KRA boss John Njiraini last week supported the move to reintroduce tax on winnings, saying it will allow the authority to access useful data to monitor other taxes, including corporate tax, withholding tax and PAYE.He told the committee the proposed amendments to the law will increase Exchequer revenues. Njiraini said Sh4.7 billion has been collected from eight major betting companies in three years. Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery sidestepped Midiwo by submitting a parallel draft bill on regulating the industry.
