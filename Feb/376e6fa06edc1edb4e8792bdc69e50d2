The Busia government has hired 439 ECD teachers. Governor Sospeter Ojaamong handed the teachers appointment letters on Wednesday at a ceremony in Busia Polytechnic grounds."This should go a long way in improving delivery of quality pre-primary education in the country," he said. Ojaamong said another 439 Early Childhood Development Education teachers will be hired in the next financial year.However, teachers from Funyula and Budalang'i who were left out protested, accusing the county Public Service Board of bias. They said those appointed are relatives of county government officers. They threatened to sue.Majority leader Josephat Wandera and nominated MCA Alice Chevi backed the protestors. "Schools in my region, such as Lugulu AC and Bulwani, were not considered. Why the bias?" Wadera asked.Ojaamong said they would have hired the teachers sooner but were constrained by a Knut lawsuit.CPSB acting chairman Lawrence Akijakin said 26 teachers out of the 439 are men. He urged men to change their attitude towards some jobs.Knut Teso branch secretary Deogracias Owaya praised Busia for being the second county to employ ECD teachers with the blessing of the national office."Kericho was the first, two weeks ago, to sign a recognition agreement with Knut, teachers and the county government. Knut secretary general will visit Busia in two weeks to sign an agreement with the Busia government," he said.Assembly Education Committee chairman Abiud Ochillang'ole said he was one of three ECD teachers in 1993 in Busia. He said they taught under trees."Our salary was Sh200 to Sh300 and it was not even regular. Things have changed these days," he said.
