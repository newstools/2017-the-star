Police who die or sustain permanent injuries while at work could be reprieved from tedious and bureaucratic compensation procedures the National Police Service Commission and Treasury have been subjecting the officers to.A parliamentary committee yesterday gave NPSC chaired by Johnstone Kavuludi 14 days to draft a comprehensive law to reimburse the officers from revelations that cops are excluded from the universal injury compensation scheme for all civil servants.Kavuludi assured National Assembly Committee on National Security and Administration chaired by Asman Kamama (Tiaty) that two weeks is enough for them to come up with a draft Bill similar to the Work Injury Benefits Act, 2007 laying down compensation for other civil servants.NPSC was responding to the National Police Service (amendment) Bill,2016 by Mvita MP Abdulswamad Nassir to have all officers to receive free medical care and compensation from an insurance scheme serviced by the government when injured or die while on duty. Nassir told the committee and NPSC that hundreds of affected officers have been unable get the "rightful dues" because many are forgotten when are out of the Service. "These are men and women risking their lives to protect us and guarding our businesses including banks. It is not fair for the Police Service to ask individual officer to seek compensation directly from Treasury after suffering an injury. Let us make life of those putting their lives at risk for the state easier," Nassir said.There has been a growing number of police officers killed or injured while at work in the country such as the Turkana County, Kapedo attack where 21 cops were killed by bandits in 2014, just two years after 40 officers were murdered in Baragoi, Suguta Valley, Samburu County.Kavuludi while faulting Nassir's proposed law said,"If the Bill is left as currently drafted and passes into law, then officers may universally be compensated even in instances where there is willful assumption of risk or misconduct on the part of an officer."He added that it has been "depressing" when approached to by helpless families of affected officers to compel Treasury for compensation.The NPSC chairman said they research, do a comparison with other countries to define the extend an injured officer can be compensated when drafting law to avert abuse to the reimbursement."Fourteen days will be adequate for us to come up with the proposals to find a long term solution in compensating the officers. Kamama reminded Kavuludi accompanied by other NPSC commissioners that the issue of repaying affected officers is "real not theory" because the country has lost many while discharging their constitutional mandate.
