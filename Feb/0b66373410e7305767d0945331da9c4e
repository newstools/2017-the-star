It was a long drive from Nairobi to Samburu National Reserve. But we were excited to finally arrive.Almost immediately we began the game drive, we came across Grevy&rsquo;s zebra, an endangered species found only north of the equator. They are much larger than the ordinary zebra, with bigger ears, thinner stripes and white stomachs.The reticulated giraffes of Samburu have a more defined pattern of dark brown patches and stark white lines compared to the more widely occurring Maasai giraffe. There seemed to be plenty of giraffe in Samburu but recent research indicates giraffe populations have declined by up to 40 per cent in 15 years.The gerenuk is a fascinating animal with its extra-long neck, small head and huge eyes. Its body is specially adapted to feed on trees while standing up on its hind legs and stretching its neck. The Beisa oryx is an attractive antelope with dark face markings and very long, straight horns that can be fatal during a fight. It is hard to tell the difference between the Somali ostriches and those found elsewhere in Kenya, except during the breeding season. Then, the male Somali ostrich acquires a blue coloration on the neck and legs, whereas the Maasai ostrich turns pink in the same areas. The Ewaso Nyiro river, which means &lsquo;river of brown waters&rsquo;, passes through the Samburu Reserve and is a favourite watering point for elephants. Growing along the banks of the river are Doum palms, unusual among palm trees because they have branches. Early morning and late afternoon are the best times to spot lions and leopards, which are more active at this time when the temperatures are cooler. If you have some time to spare, a visit to a Samburu homestead is an interesting cultural experience. We were welcomed with lots of singing and traditional dances, and afterwards, there was an opportunity to enter a traditional manyatta with roofs of woven palm fibres.LOCATION: Samburu CountyCONTACTS:(+254) (20) 2379407kwsti@kws.go.ke Star rating: 4/5
