Amani leader Musalia Mudavadi has dismissed reports of low voter turnout in Opposition strongholds as a Jubilee narrative to rig the August poll.Musalia said the narrative, which is based on the "misinterpretation of facts", has been deliberately created by Jubilee to prepare the country for a rigged election.&ldquo;On what basis an area is categorised as a Jubilee or Nasa zone, only the originators of this lie know," he said.&ldquo;Kenyans should know that stealing elections will be justified by the strengths of this mythical Jubilee areas with high voter registration turnout. Indeed this high voter turnout is a bogey meant to justify intended theft of the vote."Read: Keep off Nasa affairs, Musalia tells Uhuru, RutoAlso read: Musalia gets close to Raila, Kalonzo in NASA ratingsThe former Sabatia MP also said in a statement on Monday that the narrative was aimed at dampening the voter turnout of Nasa supporters across the country.But Musalia said he was confident the Opposition coalition will clinch the presidency, based on the number of voters in each county, according to the IEBC registry.&ldquo;We appeal to Nasa supporters not be deceived because the logic of low voter registration turnout in Nasa areas is defective. They should continue registering in large numbers,&rdquo; he said.Musalia added that the IEBC's provisional figures placed the number of registered voters in Western, Nyanza, Coast and lower Eastern at about two million, out of 3.5 million nationally.He said the figures clearly indicated that the National Super Alliance was ahead of Jubilee in the numbers game.&ldquo;It makes no sense to compare a voter turnout of one out of an expected two with another area's turnout of three out of expected ten,&rdquo; he said."Perceived Jubilee areas like Rift Valley are a myth because of the cosmopolitan nature of the region. One community in the region is being used to define the percentages that hide the actual figures in the region."The Amani leader further said that the electoral commission based its potential number of voters - nine million - on those with IDs but who were not listed.He said the IEBC hasn&rsquo;t cross-checked whether the targets have not registered in areas other than their home counties. "For instance, Western region has extreme rural-urban migration and supplies labour nationally. It is possible that despite registering in their home counties for IDs, they chose to register as voters wherever they are domiciled," he said.Musalia also said the narrative of &ldquo;strongholds&rdquo; was based on ethnic arithmetic that ignores the fact that the majority of newly registered voters are young Kenyans who have stakes bigger than their tribal origins.He urged all Kenyans to continue registering as voters in a push for change through the ballot box.Read: Ipsos: NASA unity only way to beat Uhuru
