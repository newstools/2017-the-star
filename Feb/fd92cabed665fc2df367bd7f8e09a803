Deputy IG Joel Kitili (pictured) yesterday told the Milimani Anti- Corruption Court, Nairobi, that Sound Day Corporation did not deliver 3,500 firearms for the contract known as Police Modernisation Security Equipment. He is a witness in the Anglo Leasing case against former Finance Minister David Mwiraria, former Internal Security PS Dave Mwangi and others. Kitili said the goods received were not for the contract.
