Technological waste, paintings and a stuffed human doll are among the intriguing and fascinating things currently being exhibited at the Alliance Fran&ccedil;aise.TECHNOLOGICAL DETERMINISMThe exhibition, titled Connectivity: More is Less? provides the audience with various artistic perspectives of technological determinism.It also shows the effects of planned obsolescence of electronic devices on the environment.Five artistes came together to explore the influence technological advancement has on the existence of human beings.They are Greenman, Moroko and Kevo Stero from Maasai Mbili Artiste Centre, Joan Otieno from Dust Depo and Dani Ploeger from the Netherlands.TECHNOLOGY OVERLOAD?The multimedia exhibition, which began on January 26, revolves around how technology has become a major component of the human existence.Where others see technology as an answer to all the problems we face, the artistes see too much dependency on technology affecting and shaping the way people think and behave.The artistes have managed to put together mixed media works and models, which contain elements of electronic waste.One of the catchy pieces, for instance, is a fully-dressed human doll christened Onyis Benson. DEPENDENCY SYNDROMEThe doll is lying on the ground trapped in a cable net (to represent the internet) on which devices are attached. The installation, created by Joan Otieno, depicts her reality and the society&rsquo;s dependency on technology.It is clear from the pieces displayed that artistes scavenged material, hunted down for electronic waste and managed to create outstanding paintings and collage.The exhibit runs until February 12.
