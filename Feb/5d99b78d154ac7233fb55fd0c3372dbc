Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto&rsquo;s Chama Cha Mashinani has dismissed claims that residents are registered as members against their will.Secretary general David Sang yesterday termed baseless claims by some Bomet East residents that some county employees are collecting their ID numbers and registering them as party members without their consent. Speaking to The Star, Sang said the reports are propaganda peddled by the Jubilee Party to stop them from carrying on with their registration. The region is a perceived Jubilee stronghold. &ldquo;All those who have been registered into the party willingly surrendered copies of their IDs, which is a requirement by the registrar of political parties for anyone resigning from another party. At no time have we duped or coerced anyone as claimed,&rdquo; Sang said. &ldquo;Jubilee has now sensed danger in the region, hence, resorted to diversionary tactics to stop us from recruiting new members.&rdquo;
