A fish farmer in Mayenje village, Busia town, has lost stock worth Sh300,000 after it was poisoned.Thieves sneaked into Ridah Ouma&rsquo;s home last Friday and poured the chemical into his fish pond, killing more than 1,000 catfish.She said they may have killed her fish to get back at her after she refused to open the door for them at 11pm.Ouma said she woke up to feed the fish, but found them dead.But Mayenje assistant chief Charles Obonyo said the culprits may have been neighbours envious of Ouma.
