Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi has said Cord leader Raila Odinga called him to express his anger over the low voter registration in his constituency.He said Raila phoned him on Friday and raised concerns over the snail pace at which Ugunja constituents are registering as voters, even as the February 14 deadline approaches. The MP, however, defended himself, saying aspirants and ODM party officials from the constituency are not enthusiastic about the drive.Wandayi said Sidindi ward is the worst performing in the voter listing exercise. He said the ODM officials and aspirants from the wards have instead embarked on engaging in politics at funerals, rather than mobilising the voters. &ldquo;The remaining few days of the ongoing mass voter registration will determine whether Raila will beat President Uhuru Kenyatta at the ballot. It&rsquo;s a matter of life and death,&rdquo; Wandayi said.He spoke on Saturday at Sidindi market during the commissioning of the ongoing voter registration.The ODM party official warned that aspirants in the region will not be awarded with certificates if they win in the nominations, unless they demonstrate how many votes they mobilised for Raila&rsquo;s presidential bid.&ldquo;We will vet all aspirants on the account of votes they brought in for Raila,&rdquo; Wandayi said. He said it is pointless for aspirants to be in the assemblies without the state power.Wandayi said it is foolhardy for aspirants to selfishly consolidate votes for themselves and go to Parliament and not mobilise voters for Raila.The legislator said what they are currently witnessing in the National Assembly is the frustration meted out on them since Jubilee enjoys the tyranny of numbers and state protection.Wandayi was accompanied by area MCA Joseph Agoko and the Luo Council of Elders secretary general Owino Nyadi.
