She often wore a black dress and a wry smile, her head tilted in a contemplative pose.She was a bright-faced, beautiful young woman, perhaps thinking about life after her Engineering course at the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology.These are some memories about 22-year-old Grace Nduta Mwaura, whose body was found dismembered and disemboweled, some parts scattered, some dumped in a latrine.Her brother, Charles Kibe Mwaura, 24, is accused of murdering her on or about January 25. This followed a quarrel over a bowl of Weetabix cereal. He is in police custody awaiting trial.Now her father Elizaphan Mwaura Kibe is mourning the loss of both a daughter &mdash; whom he called his best friend &mdash; and a son.On Thursday, Grace smiled down from her portrait at family and friends assembled for her memorial service at Kahawa Sukari Deliverance Church.Her life, so full of promsise, ended abruptly and brutally. Some remains were strewn about, like a carcass for hounds, on a coffee plantation in Juja, Kiambu, 30km from Nairobi.Other body parts were recovered from a pit latrine at the family home in Kahawa Sukari &mdash; a week after she was reported missing.The discovery of her remains on February 2 may have been closure of sorts for her family. But the arrest of her brother for the ritual-like killing plunged the family into unfathomable anguish.When her father Elizaphan rose to give his tribute, his solid frame looked frail and his voice quivered.He had last seen his daughter on the day she died, when she helped him pack his swimming gear, he recalled painfully. One could see his tears as he peered through his glasses. His wife, standing next to him, wept openly.But when Kibe opened the written tribute to his daughter, his voice failed him.He waved his friend, Simon Ngige, over to read the letter, only allowing speaking a brief farewell: &ldquo;Always call me Baba, Grace,&rdquo; he said to her.That&rsquo;s the way he would want to be addressed as a way of keeping his daughter&rsquo;s memory alive.Mwaura spoke of his close relationship with Grace and the memories he will treasure.&ldquo;You were not only my daughter but my best friend,&rdquo; the letter read.Nduta&rsquo;s aunt, Jane Makumi, spoke of their collective dreams that had been shattered: a big graduation party and an even bigger wedding.She said Grace was a hardworking girl who strove to earn her position in her university class.&ldquo;She was the kind of child any parent would want to have,&rdquo; Makumi said.Victoria Gakii, a fellow Engineering student, remembered Nduta as a caring person who was full of life, hardworking and a committed Christian.Ironically, the only statement that made any direct reference of the man accused of killing his sister was made by their father.&ldquo;I remember one time at the Coast,&rdquo; Mwaura said, as though addressing Grace directly. &ldquo;You made such delicious food that your brother took three portions.&rdquo;The pain of that loss will endure and family and friends will struggle to understand how their understand how their son turned against his own blood.
