Mombasa Deputy Governor Hazel Katana is a lone ranger with no clout in the county&rsquo;s politics, Trade executive Hamisi Mwaguya has said. He said Katana&rsquo;s move to the Jubilee Party will not stop his bid for senator. &ldquo;She has committed political suicide if she had a political life. Mombasa remains an ODM zone. It is like walking out of a brick house into a grass house in the middle of a storm,&rdquo; Mwaguya told the Star. She was welcomed to JP by President Uhuru (pictured) on Wednesday.
