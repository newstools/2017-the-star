The family of the late Kwale Senator Boy Juma Boy want his younger brother to succeed him.Issah Juma Boy was endorsed a week after the Senator's death and intends to run on an ODM ticket in the upcoming election.ODM leaders in the region picked governor aspirant Nicholas Zani for the seat but family spokesperson Buhiri Juma said Issah was picked after a meeting with party leaders.He said during a meeting in Gasi village on Sunday that the family was just as focused and committed to the Opposition party as the late Senator was.Issah said: "I am ready to follow in the footsteps of my brother and be loyal to the party and citizens."Msambweni MP Suleiman Dori and Speaker Sammy Ruwa are among leaders in Kwale who have expressed support for Issah.Dori asked party leader Raila Odinga to give him special consideration, saying this would be the only good send off for Boy."Because Boy stood with the party and fought for it, we ask our party leaders to give the family special consideration," the MP said.Dori noted that it was not the first time family members had succeeded their relatives."We have seen it everywhere ... family members are often given priority," he said.Read: Kwale will never belong to Jubilee, Opposition leaders say at Senator Boy burialAlso read: Mvurya, Senator Boy conflict surfaces during burial, youths reject Kwale aidKwale ODM organising secretary Benjamin Tayari said their next agenda was to take the nominee to the people so he can contest for the ticket."We are not ready to lose this seat.
