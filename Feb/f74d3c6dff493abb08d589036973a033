Changamwe MP aspirant Abdi Daib has accused incumbent Omar Mwinyi of politicising the plight of Dunga Unuse residents, who were evicted in 2010 and 2015, and their homes demolished.He said Mwinyi assembled a group of legislators to drum up support for his reelection, instead of finding solutions to residents&rsquo; problems.On Friday at Dunga Unuse Mwinyi hosted the National Assembly Lands committee to listen to residents&rsquo; grievances and come up with lasting solutions. He is a member of the committee.The residents want the five-acre parcel returned to them. The House team assured them it will summon those behind the evictions so it gets to the bottom Members urged residents to reelect Mwinyi so he can continue fighting for them.
