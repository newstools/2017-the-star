National Champions Kenya Prisons men&rsquo;s volleyball team coach Gideon Chenje believes the current squad has what it takes to perform well as they make a comeback to the next month&rsquo;s African Club Championship in Tunis, Tunisia.His sentiments comes after he guided the team to recapture the title from bitter rivals General Service Unit last season&rsquo;s play-off finals in Mombasa.The reigning Kenya Volleyball Federation (KVF) national league champions missed the last edition due to various reasons and the team is set to make a mark in the annual championship scheduled for March 17 to 27. &ldquo;This is a competitive squad if our last year&rsquo;s KVF league record is anything to go by .The players have shown the urge and eagerness to record good performance in the training sessions and we want to build on that going forward,&rdquo; said Chenje.He added: &ldquo;We are not sure if we will feature in the first leg of the KVF league set for Nyeri on March 3. However, If we start the indoor training this week, we can&rsquo;t again go to the outdoor and therefore we will have to shelve our matches. But as of now, we await communication from the management.&rdquo;The tactician said they have signed Elphas Makuto, who was the Most valuable Player at the East Africa Secondary Schools volleyball show last year.He said he believes Elphas, who is a sibling to former national team player Asha, Evelyne (Prisons), Violet (Kenya Pipeline) and Luke (GSU) is a good player and will add value to the squad.
