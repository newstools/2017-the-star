Agriculture experts yesterday blamed fake seeds used by Embu farmers for the raging famine in the county.Anastashia Mbatia and Njeru Mwita said many farmers, especially maize growers, had barely any harvest because they planted wrong seeds, while others used seeds from previous harvests. Mbatia, Mwita and agro-dealer Julius Kamau said farmers have failed to change with the changing weather patterns. They said rain has become unreliable in the recent years. Mbatia urged farmers to look to agriculture officers and certified agro-dealers for guidance on the new varieties of seeds, which have been approved and can adapt to inadequate rain. Mbatia said unapproved dealers are highly likely to sell fake seeds.Mbatia, a consultant with the Agri-Experience Company, urged farmers to take advantage of their mobile phones to seek help using software such as the Mbegu Choice App to enquire about seeds suited to their ecological areas for better harvest. Mwita, a crop production officer, told them to plant at the right time.
