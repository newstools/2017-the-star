Poor leadership is to blame for voter apathy in Cord strongholds, especially in Mombasa, Senator Hassan Omar has said.The Wiper secretary general said electorate fear registering because &ldquo;they might be forced to vote back the current inept leaders&rdquo;.Speaking in Mombasa yesterday, Omar said most voters do not want to see incumbents reelected.He said Mombasa is a good example of a county that has been mismanaged.IEBC has said about 200,000 people in Mombasa are eligible to vote. The county is yet to register 100,000 residents.&ldquo;NASA is asking why our people are not coming out in numbers to register. They have shunned the exercise because they have been wronged for the last four years,&rdquo; Omar said.He said residents need to be reassured of good leadership to turn up to list.&ldquo;We cannot register as voters if we will have to vote for colour, party and not a person&rsquo;s ideologies. If NASA wants to take over this country, it must renew its entire leadership in all its counties,&rdquo; Omar said.He said it is time for new leadership. Omar said many governors have bribed people to register but not many have turned up to list.
