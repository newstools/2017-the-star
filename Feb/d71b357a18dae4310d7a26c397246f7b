Only 65 of 463 inmateshad registered as voters in two Murang&rsquo;a prisons by Friday.The voter registration for prisoners started last Monday and ended yesterday. Officer in charge of the Murang&rsquo;a women prison Edith Kimemia said the majority of prisoners do not have IDs.Kimemia said only 11 women prisoners out of 48 were registered.In the nearby men prison, 54 male inmates were registered out of the 415 prisoners held there.&ldquo;We made efforts to reach out to their families in a bid to ensure they got their IDs, but only a few relatives responded,&rdquo; Kimemia said on Friday.She said being imprisoned does not strip someone of the right to exercise a constitutional right, such as voting.Twenty-six of men prisoners registered were new, while 28 had been transferred from other facilities.Those who managed to register said they were ecstatic about participating in the elections.Prisoner Esther Wanjiku said she is eager to vote so that she can secure her children&rsquo;s future.&ldquo;I want to vote for a leader that I think will lead the country peacefully and bring development,&rdquo; she said.Wanjiku said she never thought she would get a chance to participate in an election.
