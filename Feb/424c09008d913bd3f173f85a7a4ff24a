The car which businessman Jacob Juma was driving when he was killed was registered to Nyandarua Deputy Governor Waithaka Mwangi.Investigators have been unable to unravel the murder of Juma and will recommend an inquest. The deputy governor said the Mercedes Benz KAL 007W was his, but he sold it years ago.&ldquo;I had such a car which I sold to one Charles Ngundo,&rdquo; Kirika said in a text message, in response to a question on whether he had transferred ownership of the vehicle.It is clear when Juma acquired it. Investigators from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations have told Director of Public Prosecution Keriako Tobiko to order an inquest into the murder.They concluded that Juma&rsquo;s murder was not an assassination and that he was killed by criminals on a robbery spree. Speculation has been rife that the businessman was killed on the orders of a senior government official. Politicians from Western Kenya openly blamed the police for the execution-style murder.Juma was killed on the night of May 5 last year while driving to his Karen home on the Southern by-pass.His murder took a political dimension after politicians and activist Boniface Mwangi linked Deputy President William Ruto to the death. Ruto has denied any involvement in the killings and has sued Mwangi for defamation. The Star established that among the reasons given by DCI investigators is that an AK47 believed to have been used to shoot Juma was recovered from suspects later killed by police on Uhuru Highway.The investigators told the DPP ballistic examination on the firearm revealed Juma was shot by the gang that also included interdicted police officer Simon Muturi.A statement from the Inspector General of Police on May 5 said the gang, notorious for carjackings in Karen and the neighbourhood, was responsible for Juma&rsquo;s murder.With the findings, the DCI has told the DPP there was no one to be prosecuted for the death of Juma as the main suspects had been killed.
