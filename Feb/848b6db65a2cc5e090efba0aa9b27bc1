Health PS Nicholas Muraguri has apologised following the CS' report that he was insubordinate during negotiations to end the doctors' strike.Cabinet Secretary Cleopa Mailu said Muraguri removed himself from the team he formed, which included ministry officials and Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli.The Principal Secretary told the Senate Health committee on Wednesday that he was sorry about the incident."[There was] miscommunication and the misconception that we were not in good terms," he said.But Muraguri told the team led by Migori Senator Wilfred Machage that he and Mailu held discussions and agreed on who should take part in the talks.He said they also discussed his exit from the team but Mailu interjected saying this did not happen."While there may be perceived insubordination, I accept the apology. As the CS I have to work with all shades of people," he said."...but I want to be on record that at no time did we discuss change of names as the PS has indicated."He noted that the crisis Kenya is in did not result from his perceived misunderstanding with Muraguri.Read: Mailu accuses Muraguri of insubordination during talks to end doctors' strikeThe two were stripped of their Kenya Medical Association membership, the organisation saying they committed crimes of omission and commission amid the doctors' strike which entered its 73rd day on Tuesday.
