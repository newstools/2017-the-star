Nairobi's Hotel InterContinental came alive with jazz music as artistes graced the stage to offer a spontaneous jam session performance on Thursday night. The performances which were held at the Makuti bar kicked off with Kenya's Gogosimo band who set the pace for the evening's explosive display. It was interesting to watch various instrumentalists and artistes who are scheduled to perform at the Safaricom Jazz Festival this weekend lining up to get on stage, find their place and meld with the Kenyan band. The artistes, including international acts who are also being hosted at the hotel, combined rhythmically creating a masterly set. Congolese virtuoso Ray Lema was part of the action as he got onstage to give an exemplary vocal performance.
