For 79 days now, doctors in Bomet, Kericho and about two other counties have religiously reported to work, while their colleagues across the country continue to strike.Bomet has now become the referral county for patients in most of central Rift Valley.Other counties where public hospitals have largely survived the malignant strike include Lamu and Tana River.But Bomet has been in the spotlight after doctors and county officials chased away officials of the Kenya Medical Practitioners Pharmacists and Dentists Union last December.What is the secret of these counties that the rest of the country has failed to learn?Perks increased Bomet is probably the only county that has a binding collective bargaining agreement with its doctors.In December, Governor Isaac Rutto&rsquo;s administration signed a CBA with the union's branch and this has seen the doctors&rsquo; perks increased.The doctors salaries were raised by 15 per cent, while nurses gained 10 per cent payrise and the rest of health workers received seven per cent pay rise.The nurses have also benefited from the Sh15,000-Sh20,000 allowances given by the national government in December.The county also raised the entry job group for doctors to job group N, as opposed to M for those in other counties and the national government.The county has already received overwhelming applications by doctors who want to transfer there.Erick Kibet, representing KMPDU in Bomet, said they decided to ignore the nationwide strike called by the national office since it would not have added value to them, since the county government had addressed their plight to the letter.He said: &ldquo;It would have been worthless for us to bite the fingers that were already feeding us.&rdquo;Health workers in Bomet county also received a boost from the President during his tour of the region in early December.He gave them a Christmas gift of Sh500,000 for not striking. This has boosted their morale to remain solidly in their stations and render their services.Rutto also donated Sh1.5 million to be shared out among the 612 health workers in various health facilities.KMPDU national officials have visited the county more than five times in vain, urging doctors to abandon work even after the branch signed the CBA with the county government.The health workers comprise 60 doctors (consultants, pharmacists, dentists and medical officers), 30 nurses, 105 clinical officers and 147 workers in other medical cadres.This makes Bomet one of the best-staffed counties in health.Kibet said Bomet doctors continue to receive numerous text messages from national officials threatening to forcibly evict them from hospitals.&ldquo;Though we were under pressure from our colleagues to down our tools, we upped our sleeves and stood our ground not to be cornered, and continued with our work,&rdquo; he said.Bomet nurses also ignored the December strike called by the Kenya National Union of Nurses.Richard Cheruiyot, a Knun branch official, said he is also happy his team did not but continued to serve the people.Influx of patientsThe county has experienced an influx of patients. Longisa County Referral Hospital now handles cases from the neighbouring five counties: Kericho, Kisii, Migori, Narok and Nyamira, and even from Nairobi and Kiambu counties.The influx has strained resources in the region, with the county government spending at least Sh25 million every month to buy medicine, as opposed to Sh10 million prior to the strike.Rutto is now pleading with the national government to release emergency funding to the county since it cannot turn away thousands of patients flocking from other counties.The Star visited numerous facilities, including the First Lady&rsquo;s Beyond Zero clinics, where frail patients formed long queues, but were happy that doctors were there to treat them.&ldquo;Much as most patients with various ailments are from neighbouring counties, we cannot turn them away, as they have a right to healthcare,&rdquo; Rutto told the Star.He said there was no need for doctors to go on strike because the administration was ready to engage and listen to their grievances.&ldquo;My administration has been ready to listen to these workers and address their plight, and here they are on duty without coercion from any quarter but because of my government&rsquo;s willingness to pay them their dues. Period,&rdquo; he said.Rutto said some mothers are coming from Central Kenya to deliver in Bomet. &ldquo;We are witnessing at least 200 deliveries daily by mothers, some of them coming from as far as Embu county, and which is a blessing to us as a Mashinani government,&rdquo; he said.The chief officer in charge of medical services, Bernard Sowek, said between 50 to 100 patients sought treatment daily at Longisa Hospital on normal days before the strike, but in November last year, 118,096 patients were treated in the same facility.Sowek says despite the influx of patients to Bomet, none of the more than 135 health centres have run out of drugs and other prerequisite equipment.&ldquo;Our ambulances have served us well throughout the period, and we have been able to make referrals if any to other hospitals without much ado,&rdquo; he said.The ongoing strike has also increased patient numbers in private hospitals, including Tenwek Mission Hospital and Kaplong St. Clare Mission Hospital.Longisa Hospital medical superintendent Ronny Kibet thanked his medical staff for not tiring in providing quality healthcare services to the large numbers of patients.&ldquo;Our staff are on duty 24-7 and have never ever complained of the increased workload as a result of increased patients visiting our hospitals across the county&rsquo;s five subcounties,&rdquo; he said.
