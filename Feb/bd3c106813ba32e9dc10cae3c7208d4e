The attack on ODM leader Raila Odinga in Turkana county on his campaign trail is a ploy by the Jubilee administration to assassinate him, nominated MP Oburu Oginga has said.He said on Saturday President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto have panicked after realising that NASA is enjoying overwhelming support across the country and they are now want to eliminate Raila before August 8. Oburu said the plot is well-orchestrated and involves top security officers. He said this is why the Turkana East police boss was quick to allege that it was Raila&rsquo;s bodyguard who shot in the air. The legislator told the President to direct Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery to speed up investigations.&ldquo;The government has on several occasions tried to assassinate Raila and after we thwart their ploy by going public, they subject us to constant grilling and questioning by police,&rdquo; Oburu said, adding that the laxity among security officials to arrest the youths who used guns to disrupt the meeting at Katilia shows who was behind it. He wants all those involved brought to book. &ldquo;The killing of an ODM MCA from Baringo and an MP aspirant on Friday night is a clear indication of how Jubilee plans to deal with its opponents.&rdquo;
