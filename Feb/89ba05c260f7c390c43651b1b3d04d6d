NASA governor candidates are unable to compromise and settle on one of them to face Bungoma Governor Kenneth Lusaka.Despite aspirants&rsquo; earlier meetings to come up with a working formula, the hopefuls seem to be reading from different scripts.Speaking to the Star on the phone yesterday, Wycliffe Wangamati, who seeks the Ford Kenya ticket, said talks were underway to ensure the opposition only fields one candidate.&ldquo;Yes we have already had talks with Alfred Khang&rsquo;ati and Anthon Tawai. We will be reaching for more so twe have a formidable contest against Lusaka,&rdquo; Wangamati said.Tawai was seeking the ANC ticket but has stepped out of the race, saying he will soon declare whom he will support.Others contesting in NASA affiliate parties include former Kanduyi MP Alfred Khang&rsquo;ati (ODM) and Cofek boss Stephen Mutoro (Ford Kenya). Speaking to the press yesterday, Khang&rsquo;ati acknowledged he has been talking with Wangamati but dismissed claims he had agreed to be his running mate.&ldquo;I am firmly in the race. I have said nowhere that I have interest in being somebody&rsquo;s deputy. It will not happen,&rdquo; he said. Khang&rsquo;ati said he is vying for the seat to rectify the mistakes Lusaka has made.He says he is better than Wangamati because he has more experience. &ldquo;Our talk was on how to remove Lusaka from the top seat and had nothing to do with anybody stepping down to favour another,&rdquo; he said.Khang&rsquo;ati said this was his last stab and was not ready to step down for any candidates.Mutoro said, &ldquo;There is no way governor aspirants can sit together to pick one candidate.&rdquo;
