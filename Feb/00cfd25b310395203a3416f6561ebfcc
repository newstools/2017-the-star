Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga has urged woman representative Christine Ombaka to join his campaign team or he will ensure she loses voters&rsquo; support. Rasanga on Friday said he will use his influence to urge voters to reject Alego-Usonga voters not to vote for Ombaka if she fails to heed his plea.&ldquo;It is easy for Ombaka to woo voters if she campaigns with Rasanga,&rdquo; the county chief said.He spoke in Akala, Gem constituency, during a groundbreaking ceremony that marked construction of an oil production plant.Rasanga said Ombaka has not been steadfast in declaring her stand and it is high time the county MP announced to residents the governor hopeful she is supporting.&ldquo;If you want to decamp, do it during day time and remember that I will tell my Alego people not to vote for you,&rdquo; he said.Rasanga said he will use Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo&rsquo;s elder brother, Jalang&rsquo;o Midiwo, to consolidate votes in Gem for his reelection. Jakoyo criticised him for this remark. Jalang&rsquo;o is the Education chief officer in Rasanga&rsquo;s administration. Rasanga expressed optimism that with a progressive team that includes former Gem MP Joe Donde, who is the county public service board chairman, Gem residents will vote for him.
