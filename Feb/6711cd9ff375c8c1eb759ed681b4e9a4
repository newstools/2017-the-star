President Uhuru Kenyatta has remained tight-lipped despite the deepening healthcare crisis, as opposition chiefs turn the bitter doctors' strike into a political weapon against the Jubilee administration.The opposition blames the government, the government blames the doctors and says the opposition is politicising the crisis.NASA captains Raila Odinga, Kalonzo Musyoka and Moses Wetang'ula blamed Jubilee for presiding over high level graft while paying &ldquo;peanuts&rdquo; to the medics. Opposition allies were among top lawyers who yesterday secured the release of seven medics union officials from prison.Opposition leader Raila Odinga meet striking doctors at Uhuru Park on February 15, 2017.

Thousands of people have suffered and some reports say hundreds may have died for lack of treatment.Comment: Government will continue to support talksRead: Sorry for insubordination during doctors' strike talks, Muraguri tells MailuYesterday, the Senate Health Committee urged Uhuru to intervene in internecine warfare in the health ministry that impedes a strike settlement.As the opposition laid siege to the state, Uhuru himself remained silent, though yesterday evening government spokesman Eric Kiraithe accused doctors of &ldquo;using the lives of Kenyans as a bargaining chip&rdquo;.This is despite a vicious war between Health CS Cleopa Mailu and his PS Nicholas Muraguri said to have paralysed negotiations with the medics.A doctor holds a protest placard at Uhuru Park where they gathered on February 15, 2017.

To us, what this government has shown is it lacks empathy for poor people,&rdquo; Olunga said. He and six others had been jailed for a day at Kamiti.He revealed he had been treating his comrades behind bars and announced they could roll out specialised treatment for prisoners.Before the Court of Appeal freed the seven union officials, Nairobi Hospital &mdash; arguably Kenya's premier private hospital &mdash; closed for 48 hours in solidarity with jailed union officials and doctors. Other private facilities did as well.Opposition politicians led by Raila thronged the courtroom, then marched to Uhuru Park where they addressed thousands of energised doctors and medica.When they tried to talk politics, doctors told them to stop.&ldquo;The government is constitutionally bound to respect an agreement that it's party to. You cannot sign an agreement and then lock in jail the other party that signed the agreement with you. You cannot subject doctors to such indignity,&rdquo; Raila said as doctors chanted "CBA". They demand their 2013 Collective Bargaining Agreement be honoured.&ldquo;If you look at the amount of money looted, stolen through several scandals, what the doctors are demanding is peanuts," he said.In a statement to newsroom, government spokesman Kiraithe said, "... the suffering and even death of men, women and children has become a means to apply pressure at the negotiating table. This is wrong. It is cruel and it does not speak of the hard work, sacrifice and nobility that those who pursued medicine as profession embraced at the outset of their careers."Kiraithe was keen to extricate the government from blame that it had jailed doctors' union officials. They were jailed for contempt of court for not ending the strike.He said the lawsuit filed by the Council of Governors led to the imprisonment.&ldquo;His Excellency the President in particular has been engaged on the reasons for the strike and its consequences. He has dispatched officers at the highest level his office to seek an acceptable way forward and urge all sides towards a resolution,&rdquo; Kiraithe said.Doctors march to Uhuru Park from the Supreme Court after the Court of appeal release thye seven KMPDU officials who were sentenced to one month in jail on February 15, 2017.

If you cannot resolve it, the people will do so, and that is the President," Machage said. At Uhuru Park yesterday, Raila called for health services to be partially removed from the counties but not totally reverted to the national government.He said a national health commission should manage health workers on behalf of the counties and the national government.This has been the key demand for doctors who oppose the salary limits of the Public Service Commission.Raila said the health system must be reorganised and workers should be hired and managed by the central body, similar to Teachers Service Commission.&ldquo;There is nothing wrong with devolution but the national government has deliberately mismanaged health services to portray counties in bad light," he said.Raila was accompanied by leaders of NASA, the National Super Alliance.The doctors are demanding up to 300 per cent pay rise, 400 state-paid annual master's scholarships and other conditions in their CBA. It has been declared invalid by the courts because counties were not involved though they employ most doctors.Kenya Medical Association national chair Jacqueline Kitulu said the boycott of services by doctors in private hospitals ends tomorrow but could be extended.
