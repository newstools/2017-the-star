Diplomatic services in some foreign missions in Nairobi have allegedly stalled as their ambassadors have not been accredited.Yesterday, the Star learnt that five embassies have been running without ambassadors for more than seven months.Their countries posted the ambassadors, but President Uhuru Kenyatta has not granted them audience.Before an ambassador is allowed to represent his or her country in any foreign country, he or she must be accepted by the host country.The acceptance event is known as the presentation of credentials to the host head of state.The countries include France and Saudi Arabia, whose ambassadors designate have been in the country for more than four months.They have been accepted in Somalia, where they ran consulate services.Others are Morocco, Zambia and Jordan. &ldquo;We are in a limbo. You know there are certain functions in the embassy that can only be performed by an ambassador, but, in this case, we are just being taken round in circles by officials at the Foreign Affairs ministry, as well as the presidency,&rdquo; a source said.Another source said, &ldquo;Maybe the President is a very busy man and seeing us isn&rsquo;t important or we are less influential, because, as far as we know, there is no known diplomatic tiff between our countries and Kenya that could trigger such treatment.&rdquo;In Africa, Kenya receives the highest of France&rsquo;s overseas development funding, more than even Francophone countries. Saudi Arabia is credited with helping in distribution of food aid, funding water and infrastructure projects, especially in the arid and semiarid areas. Jordan has been engaged in training KDF officers. Kenya also has a security pact with the Middle East country.Foreign Affairs PS Monica Juma was unavailable for comment as she did not respond to our calls or text messages. Last week, the President accepted credentials from Namibian and Georgian ambassadors.
