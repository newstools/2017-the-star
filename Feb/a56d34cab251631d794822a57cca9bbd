Margaret Kenyatta has cancelled this year's First Lady&rsquo;s Half Marathon to avoid "politicising the event".The First Lady said in a statement that she reached the decision to avoid conflicting the ongoing campaigns with her cause to end maternal and child mortality across the country."Over the last four years we have worked together, we have run together, bonded by our shared conviction that no mother should die while giving life and that every child should live to see their 5th birthday and I am not willing to politicise this agenda. As a consequence, I feel it necessary to cancel the First Lady&rsquo;s Half Marathon this year," she said on Saturday. She said the marathon will continue next year and thanked Kenyan and other well wishers who have in previous years joined the project.Read: [MEDIA] Elite runners expected at Sunday's First Lady Half Marathon"We have done more together than I imagined possible.
