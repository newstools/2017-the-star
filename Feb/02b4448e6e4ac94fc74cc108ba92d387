Deputy President Wlliam Ruto yesterday announced that Sh1.6 billion has been released to cushion Kenyans from the ravaging drought in the country.The amount is expected to sustain those in drought-stricken areas for five months.The Deputy President said the government&rsquo;s plan is to significantly reduce the number of deaths caused by the drought.Last month, Agriculture CS Willy Bett said two million Kenyans could be facing hunger by July, up from the current 1.5 million. He said his ministry is spending Sh5.4 billion in the second phase of the drought intervention programme to feed hungry citizens.&#8203; Bett, however, said the situation has not reached an alarming level.Ruto spoke to the press at the Uhuru na Kazi Building, Mombasa, where he was received by Coast regional coordinatior Nelson Marwa and other regional security committee members in his visit to the county.Ruto dispelled doubts that the drought situation that has affected counties such as Kwale and Kilifi, was out of government's control. He insisted 'the government has enough food'.&ldquo;The regional committee has told me that they will be working overtime to ensure that the distribution of this food will be smooth and that it will reach those who need it.the intended beneficiaries are reached,&rdquo; Ruto said.Maize, rice, beans and cooking oil are among the food items expected to be spread to the affected regions.Ruto thwarted claims that the food items are imported, stating that all the times were grown in Kenya. His statement comes after concerns that farmers in the Central region were selling produce like potatoes at throw-away prices and that the government had refused to purchase their items.&ldquo;We want to get no reports that any Kenyan has lost their lives because of starvation,&rdquo; Ruto said.Bett last month said the ministry will decide whether to import maize or not. He said data shows many farmers and businessmen are hoarding maize in anticipation.The CS said maize prices have gone up as a result. He said an inter-agency team has been formed to monitor the retail prices of maize.
