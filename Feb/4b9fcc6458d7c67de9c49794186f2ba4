Migori Governor Okoth Obado (pictured) on Thursday met officials from the Clinical Officers Union to avert a looming strike. The meetings came up as private hospitals in Migori were overwhelmed with patients sharing beds as the doctors&rsquo; strike continues. On Monday, nurses returned back to work after a week-long strike, which further disrupted public hospitals.
