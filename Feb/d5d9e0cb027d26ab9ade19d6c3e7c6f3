The Jubilee Party and any other political outfit supporting the reelection of President Uhuru Kenyatta, ethnicity, financial muscle and the number of registered voters will determine the next Embu governor.In 2013, the county had 227,286 registered voters and by the end of the last mass voter registration ahead of August polls over 61,587 more were listed.Political analysts say the candidate who will clinch the Jubilee Party nomination will have the highest chance of winning the seat because he or she will associate with President Kenyatta, and the dominant party in the region. However, as happened in the last general election, money to run a well-oiled campaign will determine the Jubilee candidate and the overall winner in August 8. Analysts say although President Kenyatta's TNA was the party of choice in the region in the last general election, many of its candidates lost in various seats to those of Kiraitu Murungi's APK, because they had the financial muscle to reach, influence and mobilise voters. This trend could repeat itself with parties such as Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua's Maendeleo Chap Chap and his Meru counterpart Peter Munya's PNU. Tribalism and/or clan loyalty and regional blocs are also highly expected to influence who becomes the next governor, with the candidate who comes from the Embu subtribe having advantage over the one from the Mbeere.In 2013, Runyenjes and Manyatta constituencies, which are dominated by the Embu community had 140,552 registered voters, while Mbeere North and South, mainly inhabited by the Mbeere had 86,734.Senator Lenny Kivuti and businessman Leonard Muriuki, who are booth seeking the MCC ticket, are the two governor aspirants from the Mbeere while in Embu, five aspirants have expressed their interest in the seat. Despite being from the minority, Senator Kivuti might benefit from the split of the Embu vote bloc. The Mbeere are known to vote as a bloc as opposed to the Embus who are not united. Others in the race are incumbent Martin Wambora, Runyenjes MP Cecily Mbarire &mdash; who will compete for the Jubilee ticket &mdash; World Bank project consultant Kithinji Kiragu, and former Transport Permanent Secretary Cyrus Njiru &mdash; both eyeing the PNU ticket and Psychiatrist Njagih Kumantha of DP.Wambora has been the most troubled governor in the country, having been impeached twice for abuse of office, flouting the Public Procurement Act in the purchase of Sh35 million worth of maize seeds that never germinated, procurement of vehicles and authorisation of the renovation of Embu Stadium at a cost of Sh50 million up from Sh8 million.The impeachment was nullified by the Court of Appeal saying the High Court's initial decision was erroneous.Despite his turbulent tenure Governor Wambora says he has completed 500 projects on which basis he is seeking reelection.In the health sector, he says he has modernised the Embu Level 5 Hospital, which is now a referral and teaching centre, by building a six-bed capacity ICU section, six-bed high dependency unit, four ultra-modern theatres and several classrooms.The governor says the hospital now has 10 functioning dialysis machines, an X-rayunit with a top-of-the-range CT-scans, MRI machines, two well-equipped laboratories, including histopathology and biochemistry labs.In education Wambora says he has employed 483 ECDE teachers on permanent basis, modernised polytechnics and equipped them with new learning equipment worth Sh8.6 million and employed permanent managers and skilled instructors.The governor says he has given plastic water tanks of 12,000 litres each to all public schools to end the water shortage problem.In agriculture, he has procured tractors to promote mechanisation, ease tillage and enhance food production.He says he has bought and distributed four milk coolers to dairy farmers. He adds that he has funded young entrepreneurs with Sh19 million Youth Trust Fund, and completed a talent academy to nurture and mentor talents.Among his achievements, Wambora says he has opened up open air markets, tarmacked several roads including Dallas Ring Road, Runyenjes Town roads and Embu-Nairobi bus terminus. He has purchased six graders, which have helped open up 105km of access roads, graded 590km, graveled 359km of roads, and installed ,1170 meters of culverts.He has installed floodlights in 66 town centres and solar lighting in Embu town, with CCTV to monitor and enhance highway security.In his quest to win the seat Kivuti says he will give his deputy executive powers, introduce consultative, participatory and transformative leadership and implement his pre-election pledges.Kiragu says he wants to manage the county professionally by ensuring it has a workable strategic development plan and vision on which, together with other players, will guide the development.Mbarire says her wish is to use the energetic skilled and unskilled youths to revolutionise the county, put cash allocated by the Treasury into good use and stop theft of public resources. Njiru has dismissed all the other opponents as politicians, arguing the office requires a manager who has been tried and tested. He says has the experience to head the county, having represented 53 countries in infrastructural development in Africa at the African Development Bank.Kumantha argues that honesty is the key to the best leadership and that he will ensure is administration will ensure integrity and deliver on the promises he has made. Muriuki, 35, banks his campaign on the young people dismissing the other aspirants as old and"people who have outlived their usefulness".In the Senate race, former Cooperative Minister Njeru ndwiga is trying for the second time to get the seat, while brother to the Public Service CS Sicily Kariuki, Kinyua Mugo is standing for Manyatta MP against incumbent John Muchiri.Opinion leaders, including Nyangi Ndiiriri Council of Elders&rsquo; chairman Andrew Ireri argue that although people in 2013 considered money, party wave and tribalism, people are now wiser and will go for leadership qualities.
