Western NASA hopefuls are sharply divided over how the alliance should hold nominations.Some aspirants favour joint nominations in which all candidates from ODM, ANC, Ford Kenya and Wiper take part in a common process.Others support a hybrid method in which each affiliate holds its nominations in opposition strongholds, but joint primaries in areas where the Jubilee Party is strong.Parties will hold their primaries on April 13-26, according to revised election timelines released by the IEBC on Friday. NASA is already facing the headache of picking its flagbearer to face JP&rsquo;s Uhuru Kenyatta.Opposition chiefs Raila Odinga (ODM), Musalia Mudavadi (ANC), Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper) Ford Kenya&rsquo;s Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula are seeking the NASA ticket.In the past few months, many aspirants, who are unsure of bagging NASA or Jubilee tickets, have shifted to smaller parties to avoid being locked out of the polls by the Elections Act. The law bars party-hopping after nominations.Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya wants NASA affiliates to agree to a joint primary to reduce internal competition that could give Jubilee an advantage.&ldquo;All candidates from ODM, ANC, Ford Kenya and Wiper should be subjected to joint nominations so opposition zones remain intact, with Jubilee candidates being their only opponents at the ballot,&rdquo; he said on Sunday.Oparanya, the ODM deputy leader, said the party has no problem with joint nominations in NASA.Mumias East MP aspirant Justine Mutobera also said NASA would help JP candidates win if affiliates go their separate ways during nominations. But Shinyalu ANC aspirant George Muruli disagreed.He said NASA would end up fielding unpopular candidates if it conducts joint nominations. This might benefit JP, he said.&ldquo;NASA will provide the electorate with an opportunity to choose a candidate of their choice under separate primaries,&rdquo; Muruli said on Sunday.&ldquo;Another challenge of joint nominations is bringing together the registers of members of different parties.&ldquo;It means a party that has listed many members goes into the primaries with an edge.&rdquo;Kakamega Senate hopefuls Seth Panyaco (ODM) and Alex Mukabwa (ANC) support a hybrid system in nominations.Mukabwa said in some instances, NASA affiliates will have to reach a consensus aboutwhom to field for governor, senator, MPs and woman representatives to avoid squabbles.Panyaco said joint nominations are suitable in areas where Jubilee has significant presence.&ldquo;In opposition-friendly areas, each party should nominate its candidates to face off at the polls, knowing either way it will be a NASA win,&rdquo; he said.Sirisia ODM aspirant Moses Nandalwe said joint nominations should be confined to the seats of governor, senator and woman MPs because they have to marshal support across the entire counties and parties be allowed to conduct independent primaries for lower seats.&ldquo;People pay nomination fees to parties because they believe in their ideologies,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Telling them to take part in joint nominations could push them out of the race.&rdquo;
