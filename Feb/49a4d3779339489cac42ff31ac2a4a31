Former Sunderland striker Asamoah Gyan is among a group of more than 40 players deemed to have "unethical hair" under United Arab Emirates Football Association guidelines.The 31-year old Ghanaian is on loan at Dubai-based Arabian Gulf League side Al Ahli from Shanghai SIPG.In 2012, Saudi Arabia goalkeeper Waleed Abdullah was told to cut his "un-Islamic" hair by the referee before playing for his club side Al Shabab.The Saudi rule bans mohawk-style cuts.Some Islamic teachings ban 'Qaza' hairstyles, which include mohawks, because only part of the head is shaved, leaving other parts unshaven.The BBC has asked the UAEFA for clarification on its guidelines and is awaiting a response.According to Middle Eastern football website Ahdaaf, Al Wahda's Suhail Al-Mansoori was told to cut his hair while UAE international and 2016 Asian footballer of the year Omar Abdulrahman, who sports a similar style, was let off.
