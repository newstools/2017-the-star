Kenya Human Rights Commission has asked citizens to participate in a campaign against the government for infringing on Kenyans' privacy by tapping phones.The rights group in a statement said it will start the chat through Twitter using the hashtag #MobilePrivacyIsMyRight from 12 noon.This is after the government through CA ordered mobile phone companies to allow it tap into their computers. The phone companies are Safaricom, Airtel and Orange Telecom Kenya. According to sources at the authority, CA contracted an agency that will tap over 40 million mobile users in Kenya ahead of August 8 polls.In January,CA warned media houses against contravening guidelines on coverage of this year's general elections.Read: CAK warns media houses against bias during coverage of August pollThe device that insiders call "black boxes" will copy the data passing through them to another database on the CAK head office along Waiyaki Way in Westlands.With this, it is believed the government will gain access to the texts and mobile phones transactions of individuals.In many circumstances, the government can only be allowed to tap into people's phones when it is guaranteed by the court.This happens when a case is being pursued and officials need to get leads into the matter.In a letter to the mobile companies, CA asked to be allowed to install the software."Kindly facilitate our principal contractor Broadband Communications Networks Limited to access your site and install the link at the data center or the mobile switching room," the letter read.The letter further stated that the link should terminate close to core networks elements that shall integrate to the DMS solutions."The DMS block diagram and integration requirements for this setup was shared with your technical team on January 17," it said.Insiders say the Broadband company was awarded Sh207.2million tender to design, supply and install the tapping software.But a source from CA told the Star on Friday that the software is not meant to get confidential data from Kenyans."It is meant to block the usage of counterfeit devices, not gaining access to people's privacy. In fact the software cannot access any personal details," he said.The source said Kenyans should not worry about the software, adding "it is safe.""We need to understand how the software works. The reports in the media are not entirely true. The counterfeit devices bring down the quality of the phones, that's why we are introducing the software," he said.The authority said the project is expected to identify all mobile phones in Kenya using a combination of serial numbers called International Mobiles Equipment Identity.CAK is expected to hold a press conference to explain further to Kenyans. With the tapping of the phones, the government will breach into the privacy of Kenyans.According to the constitution article 31, every person has the right to privacy, which includes the right not to have(a) their person, home or property searched;(b) their possessions seized;(c) information relating to their family or private affairs unnecessarily required or revealed; or(d) the privacy of their communications infringed.In 2014, Muslim clerics in Mombasa opposed proposals to give the National Intelligence Service powers to tap private communication via calls, text messages and emails.The proposals were contained in the Statute Law Miscellaneous (Amendment) Bill, 2014.The Council of Imams and Preachers of Kenya said if passed, NIS will be infringing on the privacy of Kenyans, thus going against the constitution.
