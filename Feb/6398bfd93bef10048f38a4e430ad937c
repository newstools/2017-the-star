Baktash Akasha and Ibrahim Akasha are the sons of slain drug baron Ibrahim Abdalla Akasha who was shot dead by a gunman on a motorcycle in Amsterdam in 2000.Sixteen years down the line, his sons are taken to the US to face charges of drug trafficking. An operation by the US anti-narcotics agents who posed as Colombian drug dealers led to the arrest of the four.In November 2014, four people, including the two sons of Ibrahim were charged for allegedly operating an international drug trafficking syndicate. The four were arrested in a house in Nyali by a team of more than 20 FBI and local agents, including the Anti-Narcotics and Anti-Terror units&rsquo; officers. The officers raided the home.They seized documents and mobile phones they said would help in their investigations. One of the suspects was arrested with 98 packets of heroin in Nairobi by the US Federal Bureau of Investigations agents in coordination with local security agencies.He was then flown to Mombasa at the request of the US government, where he led the agents to the other suspects, who were also arrested.Still in 2014, the US applied to a Kenyan court for the extradition of the Akasha sons and two foreigners to stand trial for drug trafficking.The warrant sought extradition of the four to the US for trial on allegations of being part of an international drug trafficking ring.The warrants were presented through the Foreign Affairs ministry and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. &ldquo;The Embassy of the United States of America presents its compliments to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Trade of the Republic of Kenya honouring the provisional arrest of the four,&rdquo; reads the report presented in court by State counsel Alexander Muteti.Muteti told the court the DPP&rsquo;s office received the notice on November 10, and that it requested Kenya to cooperate by executing a provisional arrest for purposes of extradition. The Akashas are described as leaders of an organised crime and drug trafficking network. Goswami is said to be the principal manager of the Akashas&rsquo; drug manufacturing and distribution business. Muteti told Mombasa Chief Magistrate Maxwell Gicheru that Kenya, having adopted international laws as part of its law, is under obligation to effect the warrants.
