Confusion marred the start of the two-week voter registration of Kenyans in the diaspora after IEBC failed to spell out requirements.The commission stated neither the gazetted registration centres nor the requirement that those targeted must have valid passports.Kenya Diaspora Alliance chairman Shem Ochuodho said "at least 99 per cent" of those who turned up on Monday were turned away for lacking the document.Ochuodho said most Kenyans living in EAC member states use national IDs as their travel document."It is therefore unfair for IEBC to demand passports from them," the former Rangwe MP said in an interview with the Star on Monday.Ochuodho said they will file a suit against the commission for failing to ensure the availability of adequate infrastructure for the registration of those abroad.The chairman noted that more than two million citizens were likely to be locked out of the general election as they were yet to be registered.They want those residing outside the country to elect MCA, MP, senator, woman representative, governor, and president of their choice.But the commission said the listing, set to end on March 6, will only allow those registered to vote for president."A Kenyan living outside the country who is registered as a voter will only vote for a presidential candidate of his or her choice," read a notice on Sunday.Read: Ensure Kenyans in, EA, Diaspora vote in 2017 - Mutua tells IEBCAlso read: Kenyans in the diaspora slam IEBCArticle 82 of the constitution requires the commission to progressively register citizens residing outside Kenya to allow them to vote."We want the court to help us understand what exactly progressive voting means," Ochuodho said.He accused the IEBC of trashing their recommendations on how to make Kenyans in the diaspora participate in general elections."Our proposals were backed by the Foreign Affairs ministry but the IEBC chose to rubbish them," the diaspora chair said.In May 2015, the Supreme Court affirmed the right of eligible Kenyans living in the diaspora to vote. They number about three million.The alliance wants those living in the UK, Belgium, China, Japan, Australia, Canada, UAE, and the US registered."Since we have data showing that most Kenyans live in these countries, we recommended that they register," Ochuodho said."We will also ask the court to compel the commission to register Kenyans in the proposed countries before the deadline."The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission will register Kenyans living in Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi and South Africa.This follows the lapse of the February 14 deadline for voter registration and an extension of five days.The exercise will be conducted at Pretoria (SA), Dar es Salaam and Arusha (Tanzania), Kigali in Rwanda, Kampala in Uganda and Bujumbura in Burundi.The commission said in its notice that it had dispatched eight clerks to South Africa for the registration ahead of the August 8 polls.The IEBC said on Sunday that those living abroad need a valid passport and should be registered as Kenyan citizens to be listed.CEO Ezra Chiloba said diaspora voting will take place in Kenyan embassies, consulates and high commissions.But vice chairperson Consolata Nkatha said last week that logistical challenges and limited time had undermined the commission&rsquo;s ability to actualise diaspora votinMore on this: Logistics, time limit IEBC voter listing in diaspora &mdash; NkathaRead: Political parties target 2017 diaspora vote
