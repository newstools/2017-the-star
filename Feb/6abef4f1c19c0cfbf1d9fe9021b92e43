All private hospitals at the Coast will close for 48 hours from yesterday midnight if jailed medics&rsquo; union officials are not released, doctors&rsquo; association chairman Nahendra Pancholi has said. The Kenya Medical Association Coast division&rsquo;s chairman said withdrawal of service is for 48 hours, subject to a review. Pancholi said MPs&rsquo; salaries should be cut to enable implementation of the CBA. Pancholi said all the stumbling blocks, including the senior officers at Afya House, should resign or be sacked. &ldquo;There will be no negotiations until the CBA 7 are released,&rdquo; he said. Pancholi spoke at KMA hall at Pandya Hospital yesterday. Kenya Association of Physician chairman Sudi Mohamed said the CBA was to be finalised this week, but the state frustrated the efforts.
