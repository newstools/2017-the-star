Competition among smartphone manufacturers is growing at a rapid rate in Africa more so in Kenya where it is the leader in mobile money transfer. However, most companies are bringing in high end devices only where not everyone can be able to buy them.Some of those low end smartphones are of poor quality and don't have a great life span.Kenya herself has seen the emergence of numerous companies, some new, and some have been there for decades and are now upgrading their smartphones so as to have a share of the market.The GR5 2017 is Huawei's new smartphone that is set to be launched in the Kenyan market later this month as the company bets on midrange and entry level smartphones to increase its local sales and market share.Customers will be privileged to pre &ndash; order the device for KES 34,999 and get a free Huawei Fit worth KES 11,999. The device is the only one in the mid-range level that comes with a dual camera and a neat finger print sensor.The company last year partnered with leica, to develop two generations of dual-camera.This new feature led to a new trend of smartphone photography and establishing new benchmarks for image quality with the P9 series and Mate 9 series popular with consumers in Kenya.This year, the technology company is targeting to increase its smartphone sales by at least 50 percent. According to IPSOS, the company's global brand awareness has also seen steady growth, rising from 76% to 81%, with a 66.7% and 100% increase in overseas user consideration and preference.&ldquo;We strive to enable users experience great features in more affordable devices at the mid-range level. This can be attributed to the company&rsquo;s consumer-centric approach that focuses on creating meaningful innovation, as well as an ongoing commitment to build a premium brand and reinforce its global channels and service capabilities.&rdquo; says Mark Hemaobin, the General Manager, Huawei Mobile Kenya.
