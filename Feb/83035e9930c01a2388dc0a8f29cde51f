Deputy President William Ruto will tomorrow tour Kakamega county to market the Jubilee Party agenda.Ruto will be in Western on a day NASA bosses Raila Odinga of ODM, Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper), Musalia Mudavadi (ANC) and Ford Kenya&rsquo;s Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula will hold their first joint rally in Eldoret, the DP's home turf.This also comes two days after NASA leaders signed a power-sharing agreement in readiness for the August 8 election.The DP&rsquo;s last visit of Western was in mid-January, when he toured Mumias and Bungoma towns to encourage residents to register as voters in the just concluded final mass voter listing.Ruto, however, encountered hostility after youths who chanted anti-Jubilee slogans blocked the road in Bungoma town, forcing him to change route.Kakamega is one of the counties classified as "NASA zone".The DP will be in Malava constituency to launch development projects.Malava MP Malulu Injendi said Ruto will launch the Last Mile Project in the constituency at Fuvuye market.&ldquo;The DP will be here to also launch street lighting in Malava township, besides initiating other development programmes,&rdquo; he said.Jubilee is keen on a share of the 1.9 million voters in Western that is likely to tilt the scales in its favour in the August polls.The DP will be visiting Kakamega for the first time since a section of Jubilee followers defected to opposition outfits aftre former TNA secretary general Onyango Oloo ditched JP for ODM.Reports indicate that Jubilee leaning MPs in Western are waiting to switch bases to opposition, should Mudavadi be named the NASA presidential candidate.Navakholo MP Emmanuel Wangwe yesterday said he would support Mudavadi if he is a presidential candidate.&ldquo;I supported him in 2013 as my senior brother, because he was running for President. I cannot stand in his way because he is looking for a political position in this country,&rdquo; he said.Wangwe said, however, the perception there is no Jubilee in Kakamega is a fallacy.&ldquo;If I can purchase Jubilee membership cards worth Sh10,000 and they are finished in two days it means Jubilee is a party that is being accepted,&rdquo; he said.
