Kenyan rapper Gabu was "humbled" by Zambian singer Roberto's immense talent.The two have worked together in a new collaboration jam titled She Be Nice, a "dancehall ghetto love song".According to Gabu, his collabo track with the Amarula hit maker is just one of his efforts in trying to "push" Kenyan music to international levels."Working with Roberto humbles me because he's such a humble talented guy."My plan going forward is to represent Kenyans on an African platform."After flying to Zambia for a week and doing the collabo, I realised that the only way to push Kenyan music on another level is by competing with the 'big fish' of Africa," he told Word Is."Love doesn't care if you are rich or poor. Anyone can love and be loved," adds the P-Unit rapper in reference to the song.Watch the new single below:
