Harrison Ford is back in the cockpit again just days after he almost crashed his single-engine plane into a Boeing 737 full of passengers.The 74-year-old actor, who looked well dressed in dark jeans, sunglasses, a blazer and shirt, was spotted boarding a green Cessna Citation Sovereign 680 at Santa Monica Airport with his copilot before the pair jetted off together, on Thursday morning.Just three days earlier, Ford was involved in a near miss with an American Airlines jet when he mistakenly landed on the taxiway at John Wayne Airport in Orange County. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) told TMZ they will investigate but the probe has been put on hold due to a case backlog, leaving him free to fly for the foreseeable future.A witness who saw the Star Wars actor's harrowing miss at John Wayne on Monday claimed that Ford had 'completely misjudged the runway'. The man told the gossip site he was looking out of the windows at the terminal, while waiting for a friend, when he saw Ford's single-engine Husky plane coming in to land.He described the plane as looking totally out of position and like it was about to crash after Ford 'completely misjudged the runway'. Moments before the plane hit the ground, Ford 'banked really sharp' and 'hit hard' on the adjacent taxiway, according to the witness who also snapped a photo of the landing.The claims, which seems to infer that the Indiana Jones star had initially been aiming for the runway, differs from earlier reports which stated that the 74-year-old had simply mistaken the taxiway for the parallel runway. The runway is marked by a huge '20-L' in white paint at one end.Ford's mistake saw his plane just pass over the American Airlines 737, carrying more than 100 passengers, which was waiting to use nearby 20-R. The FAA told TMZ that the investigation into the Star Wars actor's near-miss has been put on hold, leaving his fate in the wind for the foreseeable future.They said they had a considerable backlog of cases and it could be weeks before they are able to process Ford, who was in a serious plane crash in 2015 but has been described by several airports as an excellent pilot.Since the case does not pose an 'immediate danger,' it has been put on a backburner. However, the fallout from that investigation when it is concluded could result in anything from a warning letter to Ford losing his licence. Ford's reps had no official comment on the incident. The Hollywood legend was spotted in public for the first time yesterday, driving his Tesla Model S to Santa Monica Airport, California, on Wednesday.
