"I've had people say pretty horrible things, and the unsafe environment is just very unhealthy."The Evancho family is suing Juliet's Pittsburgh-area school district over her right to use women's bathrooms.The Trump administration's action on Wednesday reversed a signature initiative of former President Barack Obama, whose Justice and Education departments had threatened to withhold funding for schools that did not comply with its guidance.
