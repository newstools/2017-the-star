The family of the two sons of slain drug baron Ibrahim Akasha want Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet to explain their whereabouts.Lawyer Cliff Ombeta asked the senior police officer to explain why and how the brothers were extradited to the US on drugs trafficking charges.Baktash Akasha, Ibrahim Akasha, Indian Vijay Goswami and Pakistani Gulam Hussein were extradited to the US on January 30. They face drug trafficking charges.The four were fighting extradition to the US and the proceedings were still pending at the Mombasa law courts, but they were grabbed from different venues last month and flown to the US.Ombeta told the court it should act with haste so that senior officers respect court orders. &ldquo;Put your foot down and make sure that court orders are respected,&rdquo; he said.In November 2014, a Mombasa court ordered Boinnet to ensure that none of four suspected drug barons is moved out of the police station they were held in without an order from the court.Chief magistrate Maxwell Gicheru made the ruling in a case over Ibrahim being taken from police custody to Nairobi without the consent of the court.Last week, the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions said it is not the court&rsquo;s duty to produce the two sons of the slain drug baron and two foreigners suspected of trafficking in drugs.On January 30, Ombeta filed a habeas corpus to have them produced in court. He said his clients were being held incommunicado, terming it an abuse of their basic human rights.Boinnet and DCI boss Ndegwa Muhoro were told to produce the four.But assistant DPP Alexander Muteti told the court that it should not engage in issues that does not concern it.He said the suspects&rsquo; lawyers have alluded to their clients&rsquo; being extradited. The application for habeas corpus is only made when the applicants are sure their clients are in the custody of the police, Muteti said.
