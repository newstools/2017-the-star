Kisumu resident Peter Ochola has sued Nairobi Governor Evens Kidero, claiming he illegally acquired his land in Korando.However, Kidero denied the claims and told a court he bought the land legally from owner Murithi Mbui. He said Ochola was not the owner.While appearing before Justice SM Kibunja, the governor said he followed procedure in acquiring the land nine years ago.&ldquo;The documents used to purchase the land have been unchallenged for the last nine years I have had the land," Kidero said on Thursday.Ochola had said he bought the land from Peter Angira in 2005 after which he got involved in a road accident and was discharged on July 5, 2010.Ochola said upon discharge he went to view the land and found it fenced and developed. He said that when he inquired, he was informed that Kidero had fenced it.Ochola said he found out that Angira had sold the portion of land to Mbui, who later sold it to Kidero.But Kidero fenced the whole parcel, including Ochola's portion, he said.Kidero, ignoring Ochola&rsquo;s ownership of a portion of the land, went ahead to fence the whole parcel of land.Ochola said despite repeated demands to the defendant to give him back his land, Kidero has refused to do so.Kidero notified the court that Ochola&rsquo;s main interest is to have a piece of land and he is willing to help him acquire a parcel.The case will be heard on May 18.
