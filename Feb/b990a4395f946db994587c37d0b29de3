Thirty one more have been lined up.When the trial resumed on Tuesday, Justice Jessie Lesiit barred journalists, court orderlies, relatives of the victims and suspects and the general public from sitting in the courtroom.Lesiit said the parties will be barred until key witnesses in the protection programme testify in camera.The prosecution has already called two key witnesses, among them a man who claimed Kimani threw him a tissue paper saying they were in danger.The team said it had two more witnesses who &ldquo;cannot testify in public as they are fearful for their lives&rdquo;.Only the accused persons, the court clerk, defence lawyer Cliff Ombeta, Law Society of Kenya representative Albert Sihanya and victims&rsquo; lawyer Fred Ojiambo were left in the room at Milimani law courts.Also allowed to sit in as observers were two representatives from the American Bar Association, one of them a judge.Read more: High profile Willie Kimani murder trial resumes in cameraKimani and the two others were abducted after a session at Mavoko law courts on June 23.A witness said he saw Leliman at the courts before Kimani, Mwendwa and Muiruri went missing on that day.
