Michelle Obama was spotted getting in an early afternoon workout at SoulCycle in Washington DC on Thursday.The former first lady was photographed making a quick exit from the spin studio after taking a noon class and heading straight towards the small envoy of Secret Service cars waiting to take her back to the $4.3million home she and husband Barack are living in with daughter Sasha.Michelle seemed eager to go unnoticed during the outing, a goal she successfully achieved thanks in large part to the black hat and dark sunglasses she wore to cover her face, which paired perfectly with her black shirt, black spandex and black flip-flops.This marks the first time that Michelle has been spotted in DC since she and her husband walked down the steps of the Capitol and boarded a helicopter out of the capital an hour after President Donald Trump was sworn into office on January 20.That was over a month ago, and since then the Obama family has been enjoying some much needed time off after eight years in the spotlight.All good things must come to an end however, and following a four-week span in which members of the Obama family were seen soaking up the sun in Palm Springs, kitesurfing in the Caribbean, protesting at Sundance and partying with the girls of Girls in NYC, everyone is finally back home.Sasha and her parents are together in DC after returning from Aspen on a private plane Wednesday, while Malia is busy working in New York as an intern for film producer Harvey Weinstein.And with some free time on her hands after eight years in the East Wing, Michelle decided to go have some fun at a spin class.Michelle herself has admitted to having a bit of an addiction to SoulCycle, much like fellow devotees including Chelsea Clinton, Kelly Ripa and David Beckham.Ivanka Trump on the other hand favors the Flywheel, SoulCycle's biggest competitor.People began to post on social media when they spotted Michelle in their classes a few years back, and in a video posted on her own Twitter account in May 2015 to promote her hugely successful 'Let's Move' initiative, Michelle said that the classes were one of her favorite things to do with Malia and Sasha.'I love it when my girls join me for a little SoulCycle,' said Michelle.'We all are in the dark, moving to the beat on the bikes. We love it.' The dimly-lit studios are part of the reason she would find ways to make secret visits to one of the two locations in Washington DC to take classes while her husband was in office, something that was almost impossible to do at the time.That was due in large part to Secret Service protocols, which require a team of agents with the first lady at all times while she is in the White House and only one agent with her after she has departed 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and returned to life as a private citizen.That smaller detail will remain with Michelle for the rest of her life now thanks to the lifetime protection bill her husband signed into law, which gives all former presidents and first ladies Secret Service agents for life.Children meanwhile only get them until they are 16, unless an order is signed to extend their protection.Michelle managed to do a remarkable job flying under the radar on Thursday, a feat that was made all the more difficult due to the unseasonably warm weather in DC which had people heading outdoors around lunchtime when temperatures were in the low 70s.
