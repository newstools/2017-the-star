Treasury yesterday told a Senate committee the national government will pay nurses salaries and allowances from January to June.Treasury CS Henry Rotich said counties will take over in July.He appeared before the Senate Finance committee at Parliament Buildings.Rotich also said once a deal is reached in the ongoing doctors' negotiations, the national government will also foot the bill.He told the committee chaired by Mandera Senator Billow Kerrow the national government will pay, since the 47 county governments had not budgeted for the salary increment."We will take care of that between January and June, then from there, each county will take care of its wage bill. Health is a devolved function," Rotich told the committee.An agreement between the two levels of governments and the nurses say those in Job Group G-L will receive a top up of Sh20,000. Those in Job Group M and above will get Sh15,000 from January.The payment will be in two phases in the proportion of 60 per cent and 40 per cent in the months of January and July this year, respectively.Council of Governors chairman Peter Munya and Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya asked the Senate to consider their proposal on how the money should be shared. They appeared before the committee to present their views on the proposed Division of Revenue Bill 2017.CoG had proposed an equitable share of Sh322.6 billion based on the growth rate of 6.72 per cent as a factor of inflation added onto Sh14.2 billion.Munya said it should also apply to the national government&rsquo;s equitable share.He said the Bill has no allocation on the additional 32,000km of roads worth Sh8.4 Billion shillings, which an Inter-agency task force had recommended for allocation to the counties.
