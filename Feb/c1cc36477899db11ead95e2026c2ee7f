The doctors&rsquo; union will tomorrow appeal the jailing of its seven national leaders. Branch officials and the remaining National Executive Committee members also pulled out of salary negotiations with the state until the seven are released. &ldquo;Negotiations have now ceased as they have been overtaken by the court process,&rdquo; they said in a statement read by head of Nairobi branch Thuranira Kaugiria at the Nairobi&rsquo;s Railway Club. He said their lawyer will file an appeal at the High Court tomorrow.The Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists&rsquo; Union national officials were jailed for 30 days each for failing to call off the doctors&rsquo; strike. Doctors&rsquo; have been on strike for 72 days. Employment and Labour Relations judge Hellen Wasilwa directed the men serve their sentence at Industrial Area and the women at Lang&rsquo;ata Women&rsquo;s Prison.But KMPDU branch officials told members the men had been whisked to Kamiti Maximum Security Prison.Wasilwa sentenced the officials on January 12, but suspended the sentence to give them time to call off the strike. Yesterday, she said the unionists had failed to demonstrate why the sentence should not apply. &ldquo;There is no sufficient reason why the court should review its order. The orders of this court will now crystallise and you can now start serving your sentences,&rdquo; she ruled.The seven are secretary general Ouma Oluga, chairman Samuel Oroko, first deputy chairman Titus Ondoro, second deputy chair Allan Ochanji, deputy secretary general Hamisi Chibanzi, treasurer Daisy Korir, and her assistant Evelyn Chege.The 3,000 doctors from public hospitals went on strike on December 5 last year, demanding implementation of the CBA signed in 2013. The CBA, which doctors want implemented, offers them nearly 300 per cent salary increase, giving an intern a Sh325,000 per month.
