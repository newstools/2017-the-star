AFC Leopards Mombasa branch chairman Maurice Amahwa has laughed off the club&rsquo;s alleged intention to relocate to Embu as a serious joke.Amahwa termed the idea as a suicidal move that will plunge the team to it&rsquo;s final deathbed.&ldquo;Everybody knows AFC Leopards fan base is Nairobi, Western, Mombasa, Nakuru and perhaps Naivasha. How is the team going to benefit playing in Embu? Who will be travelling there especially during mid-week matches? Are there enough football fans who can sustain the club with financial revenue?&rdquo; wondered Amahwa. Amahwa, who lost narrowly to the club chairman Dan Mule during the November polls, said he was privy to information that the club planned to relocate to Embu and maintained it was not in order and has no blessings from club members and it&rsquo;s owners. &ldquo;Club owners have a passion for this great club. There is need to entertain club owners who are the members. Embu has never been associated with serious football. The move will deny us members time and chance to watch and support our cherished team. We are starting the new season with controversies that will plunge this club into another horrible season. We survived narrowly last season and we don&rsquo;t want that to happen again,&rdquo; noted Amahwa. &ldquo;Teams, raise money from their home matches. I know Embu very well and I don&rsquo;t think the club will benefit playing there. There are no fans there to support and sustain the team financially. They will attend the first few matches and vanish to oblivion. Let&rsquo;s stop cheating ourselves,&rdquo; he said. Though the club has not come out to indicate their intension on the supposed relocation, they recently held a tour of the Upper eastern county as part of the team&rsquo;s pre-season build up. The club has lined up a couple of friendlies for the team this weekend
