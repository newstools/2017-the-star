Kenya will host the Global Goals World Cup (GGWC) tournament on March 5 at the Impala Club.The GGWC, which begun in Copenhagen last year, is a tribute to power of sport to change the world and raise awareness to most pressing challenges across the different continent.The regional tournament for women, supporting the United Nations 17 goals, will bring together 24 teams ahead of the International Women&rsquo;s Day.The event, which is being sponsored by Royal Danish Embassy, Safaricom, Save the Children, United Nations Development Programme and Eir-soccer will see the winning team get a spot to participate in the Global Goals World Cup final in September in New York.Safaricom CEO Bob Collymore said:&ldquo;The 17 UN global goals for sustainable development are a must win battle for our generation. Winning this battle requires an extraordinary and unified effort from the government, NGOs, private companies and civil societies, but the real key to success is that we the people get engaged and take action.&rdquo;Denmark&rsquo;s development minister, Ulla Tornaes, noted: &ldquo;The 17 global goals, including their recognition of gender equality are fundamental for our international engagement and are indeed worth playing for. I am happy to invite our partner to the tournament, playing for fun, creating awareness for the millions of women and girls in Kenya for whom the fight for their rights is deadly serious.&rdquo;UNDP Kenya resident representative Siddharth Chatterjee said: &ldquo;This is an excellent opportunity to bring people together to engage and raise awareness of the most pressing challenges of our time.&rdquo;
