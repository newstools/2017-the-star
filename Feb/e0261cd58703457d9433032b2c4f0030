Two Cord governor aspirants in Bungoma are strategising on a joint ticket following unconfirmed reports their coalition co-principal Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula could run for the office.Former Kanduyi MP Alfred Khang&rsquo;ati of ODM and businessman Wycliffe Wangamati of Ford Kenya held talks last week about teaming up to counter Wetang&rsquo;ula and incumbent Governor Kenneth Lusaka.Khang&rsquo;ati confirmed they met.&ldquo;Everything is still in the early stages. Our main objective is to oust the corrupt Lusaka regime,&rdquo; he said. Four Bungoma employees on Friday were charged with corruption over unlawful purchase of 10 wheelbarrows in 2014.Wangamati was unavailable. However, his communications secretary Jeff Wekesa yesterday told the Star the two leaders met in a Webuye hotel and focussed on a victory formula.&ldquo;They had a lengthy talk on how to have a sure win against the incumbent,&rdquo; he said.Wekesa said the two agreed to carry out a survey on which is the most popular and the number two will go for deputy governor.Sources privy to the talks said the duo were forced into the meeting after word went round Ford Keny leader Wetang&rsquo;ula is considering a run for Bungoma governor. This despite having said he supported the two.Wetang&rsquo;ula launched his bid for President in March last year and said he should be the opposition flagbearer.&ldquo;They had no choice but unite ahead of Wetang&rsquo;ula&rsquo;s governor bid declaration. They have increasingly been getting signals Wetang&rsquo;ula is slowly backing out of the presidential race and told close confidants he will run for the top county job,&rdquo; one source said.Wetang&rsquo;ula has denied interest in governorship, saying his eyes are set on the presidency. Other Bungoma governor hopefuls are Cofeck Boss Stephen Mutoro and Antony Tawai.
