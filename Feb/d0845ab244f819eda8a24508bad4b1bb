The government yesterday deported four foreigners suspected to be drug barons who were arrested in Mombasa on Saturday with an unknown quantity of narcotics. They are expected to be handed over to Seychelles authorities for possible prosecution today. The four were airlifted from Mombasa&rsquo;s Moi International Airport to Nairobi&rsquo;s JKIA on Saturday night for deportation. Multiagency detectives apprehended the two South Africans and two Seychellois at an apartment near the Nyali Beach Hotel on Saturday. They were identified as Dominguez and Nedy Micock (Seychelles) and Barend Nolte and Marc Faivelewitz (South Africa). Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet confirmed their deportation. Police sources indicate the four are linked to the sons of slain drug baron Ibrahim Akasha and two foreigners who were recently extradited to the US.
