Senators have asked Treasury to produce a print-out of Ifmis statements for all county governments for 2015-16 and 2016-17, showing payouts related to development expenditure.Report in two weeksOn Thursday last week, Speaker Ekwee Ethuro gave the Finance and Budget Committee two weeks to table the statements, despite chairman Peter Mositet&rsquo;s pleas to be given one month to get responses on questions about county spending.Senators Stephen Sang (Nandi), Daniel Karaba (Kirinyaga) and Anyang&rsquo; Nyong&rsquo;o (Kisumu) vehemently opposed Mositet&rsquo;s request and said the response should be tabled in the House before the official campaigns for the August election begin. &ldquo;Nominations to various parties will be next month. If we are going by what Mositet is suggesting, these members or the governors might take a lift and we find ourselves in problems. We want to investigate this thing before nominations are done, because they are going to misuse the money to campaign,&rdquo; Karaba said.Sang said, &ldquo;I am shocked by that request because this is a very urgent issue and what I am requesting are documents available in printout in the Ifmis. We are not talking about an investigation. We just need to look at where the approved budgets are. A printout from the Ifmis does not take more than a week.&rdquo; Sang said.Mositet then assured senators that he will issue the statement within two weeks.Is county spending irregular?The debate arose after Sang, backed by the majority of the senators, had asked that Treasury state whether all county governments conduct their procurement processes through Ifmis and whether the counties use 30 per cent of their budgets for development as required.Ifmis is an automated system that enhances efficiency in planning, budgeting, procurement, expenditure management and reporting in the national and county governments and it guarantees that each expense is traceable, delivering optimal value to every taxpayer.Sang, who wants to run for Nandi governor, also wants Treasury to table in the Senate the approved county governments budgets for 2015-16 and 2016-17 and to confirm whether all budgets are programme-based and adhere to the 30 per cent development fund allocation as per the Public Finance Management Act.&ldquo;It should state whether it is aware that some county governments are paying contractors for projects not undertaken and suppliers for goods [not supplied] and services not rendered,&rdquo; he said.
