The Laikipia Farmers&rsquo; Association wants the DPP and Chief Justice to establish a special prosecution unit and a mobile court for speedy action against trespassers and other criminl.Armed attacks on private and community property in Laikipia have cost investors and citizens billions of shillings. These threaten the businesses and livelihoods in one of Kenya&rsquo;s most economically buoyant regions.In additinon to appealing to DPP Keriako Tobiko and CJ David Maraga, the association has proposed a raft of measures to end the crisis after armed herders started invading private ranches and conservancies.In a statement yesterday, association chairman Martin Evans said the special unit would deal with individuals who have illegal weapons, as well as those who maliciously damage property and illegally move livestock.Evans said violence is escalating in Laikipia, resulting in loss of lives, damage to property, business losses and harm to wildlife.&ldquo;This is despite our efforts to encourage dialogue with everyone involved, and the efforts of both the county and national governments to keep the rule of law,&rdquo; he said.Evans, managing director of Ol Maisor Farm near Kinamba, said they are private investors running businesses worth Sh4 billion annually. He said they pay Sh800 million a year in salaries to 5,000 employees.&ldquo;We are sure the government has no intention of seeing us ruined.&rdquo; The association wants reinforcement of police service units. It also wants the Laikipia government, working with neighbouring counties, to urgently convene a high-level stakeholders&rsquo; dialogue to agree on a grazing plan for Laikipia and surrounding to ensure the current crisis does not happen again.The association said President Uhuru Kenyatta, Devolution Cabinet Secretary Mwangi Kiunjuri and his Interior counterpart Joseph Nkaissery have not paid enough attention to illegal cattle grazing in Laikipia.
