In a major setback to voter registration, al Shabaab militants yesterday stole four BVR kits after they attacked the Arabia police camp in Mandera East.IEBC media and communications Manager Andrew Limo said the information contained in the BVR kits is encrypted and not accessible to anyone other than commission.He said everything is being done to resume registration as possible.The attackers also made away with three rifles and an AP Land Cruiser. A 15-year-old boy was seriously injured by a stray bullet as militants exchanged fire with police. He was asleep in his home near the camp and was wounded in the head. He was rushed to Mandera Referral Hospital.The al Shabaab fighters are suspected to have come from Somalia. Their number could not be immediately ascertained. A Safaricom telecommunication mast was also destroyed by Improvised Explosive Devices planted nearby.Northeastern regional coordinator Mohamud Saleh denied rumours that the militants killed many officers in the 1.30am attack.He said there was a heavy exchange of fire between the officers and the attackers. But no officer was killed or injured, as they were in their hideouts within the camp, from where they launched a counterattack, Saleh said.&ldquo;Our gallant officers fought bravely and repulsed the attackers to Somalia. Kenyans should stop speculations, especially when it comes to issues to do with security. It&rsquo;s always good to have facts,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We should not be seen to be glorifying terror by giving them free publicity. We need to be patriotic and stop this habit of being in a rush to write things we are not sure about.&rdquo;The camp is 30km from Mandera town.A senior security officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the attackers stole the guns from the armoury. Two of the rifles are for AP officers and the other a police reservist&rsquo;s.Voter registration will end on February 14.
