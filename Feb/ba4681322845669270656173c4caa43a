Governor Josphat Nanok stage-managed the shooting during ODM leader Raila Odinga&rsquo;s rally in Turkana, three Jubilee legislators have said.They are Senator John Munyes and MPs James Lomenen (Turkana South) and Protus Akunya (Loima).Munyes said ODM was looking for sympathy votes &ldquo;after realising it was in a hostile Jubilee stronghold&rdquo;. The legislators said Jubilee does not condone violence. Munyes termed exaggerated reports the incident was an attempt on Raila&rsquo;s life.&ldquo;We have nothing against anybody or any leader. Raila is a national leader. He is free to come at any time. Nanok should desist from engaging in drama and violence to get sympathy votes,&rdquo; he said. Last Friday, Raila was forced to flee after a group of armed youths opened fire during his rally in Turkana.
