Striking doctors have been told to discard their disputed 2013 CBA, accept the government&rsquo;s proposed pay offer and draft a new agreement that will be acknowledged by all parties.Yesterday, the Senate Health Committee termed the 2013 CBA &ldquo;illegal&rdquo;. The panel has been arbitrating among doctors, the Health ministry and the Council of Governors to end the impasse.Committee chairman and Migori Senator Wilfred Machage said Parliament is ready to mediate to resolve the crisis. He warned Employment and Labour Relations Court judge Hellen Wasilwa against jailing doctors&rsquo; union officials when she rules on Friday.Machage said the move would impede talks and prolong the strike, which is in its 60th day. &ldquo;Let sense and wisdom in negotiations prevail in the interest of suffering Kenyans. Doctors should not base their demands on an illegal CBA, but draft a new document. They cannot hang on to an illegitimate CBA, yet nobody has prevented them from drafting a new one,&rdquo; he said.The doctors on January 12 suffered a setback in their push for a pay rise after Wasilwa denied the existence of the CBA, termed the strike illegal and directed the KMPDU officials, led by secretary general Ouma Oluga, to end their strike.Wasilwa will tomorrow decide whether to jail eight union officials for contempt of court and defying her orders to call off the strike. &ldquo;I do not know of this document you call a CBA. This court has not registered any CBA from you nor have I seen one. Let Kenyans know today that there is no CBA and if there was, this court has not registered any to be effective,&rdquo; she said.However, doctors maintain their CBA is legal. Machage urged doctors to be &ldquo;patriotic&rdquo; and take the state&rsquo;s 40 per cent pay increment offer and resume duties.
