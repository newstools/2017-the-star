President Uhuru Kenyatta has told off the opposition over their threats and demands to the electoral commission.Uhuru said on Thursday that the Opposition constantly creates distractions and sideshows instead of preparing for the election.He said leaders led by Raila Odinga have gotten into the habit of making outlandish claims instead of selling their agenda to Kenyans.&ldquo;Let them stop their constant threats and let us all sell our policies to the people and appeal for their votes,&rdquo; he said.He spoke while on a tour to sensitise Nairobi residents to register as voters before the mass listing ends next Tuesday.Uhuru said it was absurd for the Opposition to make insinuations about counties he visited during his first round of the voter sensitisation tour.&ldquo;I have travelled to areas as far as Garissa, Marsabit and Maralal to urge Kenyans to register as voters. Now some people are claiming that the regions I visited are leading in voter registration and there must be rigging. Give us a break,&rdquo; said the President.&ldquo;People are getting out to register because we are talking to them, telling them about the importance of the exercise."Read: Stop the mischief, Raila tells IEBC after 2nd person found with his ID numberAlso read: Raila lashes out at 'rotten' Nkaissery over double listing of IDsLast month, Uhuru undertook an extensive tour of 13 counties where he mobilised people to register in large numbers.The counties the President visited included Kirinyaga, Meru, Laikipia, Samburu, Isiolo, Garissa, Muranga, Nyeri Marsabit, Tharaka Nithi, Kitui, Kiambu and Embu.He is due to visit areas including Nyandarua and Nakuru.Deputy President William Ruto, who accompanied the President, said the Opposition was crying foul because they were in a state of disorganisation.Ruto said the Opposition's demands were never-ending and gave the impression that &ldquo;that they want to work for the IEBC&rdquo;.He said Jubilee has permitted many of the previous requests the Opposition, including an overhaul at the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission."We are determined to have a free and fair election. We did not even oppose the appointment of a former ODM life member as chair of the electoral commission," he said.Read: Chebukati, commissioners sworn in to head IEBCThe DP asked the Opposition to focus on campaigns and stop making untenable demands."Let the Opposition not panic. If they are afraid of an election in 2017 they should concede and wait for 2022," he said.But Chubekati said on Thrusday, after their meeting with members of the National Super Alliance that had listened to their concerns and would address them.Some of the issues Nasa presented in its dossier were double registration, use of fake IDs and the alleged use of the NYS register to list people as legitimate voters.&ldquo;We also raised the issue of civil servants being empowered using state resources, to facilitate registration of voters in certain areas, yet other areas are restrained,&rdquo; said Opposition leader Raila Odinga.Delayed issuance of ID cards in areas perceived to be opposition strongholds was another issue the ODM and Cord boss said they raised.More on this: IEBC meets Nasa, pledges to address voter registration concerns
