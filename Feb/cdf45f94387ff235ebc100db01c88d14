Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho has threatened to sue Kwale's Salim Mvurya, deputy Fatma Achani and Daily Nation over defamation.Joho, through MMA Advocates, said on Friday that this concerned a story titled 'Why I fell out with Joho-Mvurya' that the Daily Nation published on January 31.He termed the story malicious and said it included untruthful statements by Mvurya and Achani.According to the story, Mvurya said Joho tried to arm-twist him over mining of Nobium at Mrima Hills and Titanium in Maumba and Nguluku areas.He claimed the Governor wanted a share of the Kwale mineral resources and tenders for various supplies.Joho said the remarks were defamatory and that Mvurya and Achani should apologise within seven days before the issue of quantum of damages is discussed.He also wants Daily Nation to retract the publication and issue an apology.It was reported in May last year that a fall-out between Joho and Mvurya was brewing.Mvurya claimed at the time that Joho was plotting to unseat him by supporting other &ldquo;weaker&rdquo; candidates&rsquo; bid for Kwale&rsquo;s top seat.He said the Governor supported Kwale speaker Sammy Ruwa for governor and former minister Chirau Mwakwere as his running mate &ldquo;even though they are not strong candidates&rdquo;.More on this: Joho, Ruwa and Mwakwere are plotting my downfall - MvuryaAlso read: Kwale ODM leaders rebuke Jubilee, Mvurya after Joho 'harassment, arrest'
