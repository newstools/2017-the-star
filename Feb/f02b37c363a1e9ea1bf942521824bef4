The government has not provided adequate water and food to hundreds of Garissa residents hit by drought, Lagdera MP Mohamed Shidiye has said.President Uhuru Kenyatta declared drought a national disaster two weeks ago.Shidiye said 120,000 residents from his constituency are starving and urgently need relief food.He spoke at Benane Secondary School on Saturday after distributing bursaries.Shidiye said only 800 bags of rice, 25 cartons of cooking oil and a few bags of beans have been distributed.&ldquo;That is too little. We need help urgently to avoid losing lives,&rdquo; he said.Shidiye said pastoralists have lost hundreds of livestock, their only source of livelihood.He urged well-wishers and international NGOs to help.&ldquo;We experience drought every two to three years. The government must come up with long-term solutions like building dams,&rdquo; Shidiye said.Speaking separately in Garissa, LPK leader Ababu Namwamba urged the government to increase funding for the livestock buying programme.&ldquo;The money will enable pastoralists to start a new life once the drought is over,&rdquo; he said.Namwamba added, &ldquo;The government should not wait until the animals are too weak and are dead.&rdquo;The Garissa government, in partnership with aid agencies, has formed a monitoring centre to coordinate activities and interventions for mitigating the adverse effects of the ravaging drought.
