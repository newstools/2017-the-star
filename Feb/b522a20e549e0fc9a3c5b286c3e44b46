Lamu Governor Issa Timamy has asked the IEBC to extend the voter registration deadline to enable more people from the Boni community to list.The deadline is today.The IEBC has ruled out extending the mass voter registration drive. &ldquo;If we continue to register after February 14, there will be limited time to do the clean-up, slated for February 14 to May 10,&rdquo; IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati said last week.Timamy wants the IEBC to come up with alternative registration for the community, including door-to-door listing. He spoke in Lamu on Sunday.The governor said many residents from Basuba, Milimani, Mangai, Mararani and Kiangwe villages fled in 2014 and 2015, following al Shabaab attacks.&ldquo;Many of them haven&rsquo;t been reached because they are scattered. I&rsquo;m urging the IEBC to extend the voter registration timeline for this community,&rdquo; he said.Timamy has also accused the IEBC of setting up too few registration centres in some parts of the county, forcing residents to walk for long distances to get registered. &ldquo;In Witu for instance, people have had to walk for more than four kilometres to the nearest registration centre. Many people have opted not to register due to the distance and that&rsquo;s quite unfortunate. The commission ought to have made plans to ensure all residents have centres closer to them,&rdquo; he said.The governor has urged residents to make use of the last day and register.Lamu county has witnessed widespread voter apathy, with few listings in areas hard hit by drought.
