Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang'ula has accused IEBC and the national government of giving Cord zones a black out and only carrying out voter registration in Jubilee strongholds.He said Jubilee is selectively using taxpayer's money in voter sensitisation."Cord zones are still registering low turnout due to demotivation since there is no one to sensitise residents," he said after a meeting with IEBC officials in Bungoma hotel on Friday.Wetang'ula said the Jubilee administration has mapped out opposition regions and instructed government to neglect these areas."In places like Bungoma where they know they will get zero voted (officials) are hardly visiting to tell people to register as voters," he said.Read: IEBC compromising voter register to list foreigners - RailaThe Cord co-principal said even when Jubilee politicians visit opposition strongholds, they only ask residents for their votes without asking them to register.He said chiefs and the Registrar of Persons have failed to follow the President's directive to allocate IDs within three days."Youths who has attained the age of 18 have not yet been given their cards in opposition strongholds. Yet in Jubilee strongholds, schoolgoing children are receiving cards," the Senator said.Wetang'ula said Cord members will meet with IEBC officials on Monday to ensure even schoolgoing children who have attained the age of 18 register as voters.He also said the opposition has employed "secret ways" of ensuring residents in their regions register as voters.He asked politicians allied to Cord to stop campaigning for themselves and instead concentrate on ensuring many people register to vote in the remaining 11 days.IEBC's month-long Mass Voter Registration will end of February 14.The commission was targeting between four to six million new voters in the countrywide exercise.As registration enters its final leg, opposition and Jubilee leaders are conducting campaigns to ensure they meet thresholds to win the election.IEBC noted that Central Kenya and Rift Valley took an early lead in the percentage of newly registered voters in the first week of the month-long drive.Opposition strongholds have reportedly been lagging due to a combination of factors including voter apathy and lack of forms for potential voters to register for IDsMore on this: Central nets many voters as Western, Nyanza lag
