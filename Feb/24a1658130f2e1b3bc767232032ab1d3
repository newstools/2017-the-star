National Land Commission chairman Muhammad Swazuri has said the commission will make a decision in two weeks on the Shartuka and Njipship Group Ranches boundary dispute.He said on Thursday that from the meeting held with Maasai and Kipsigis elders on Friday last week, it was clear both groups knew the truth. Swazuri spoke when he toured the disputed land.He said the decision will be fair so it can end longstanding dispute that has left more than 10 people dead, others injured and more than 100 houses burnt in the last one year.&ldquo;From our analysis after meeting elders from both communities in Naivasha last week and our tour on the ground today, it&rsquo;s clear the truth is known by both communities. Most people fear the reaction of the members of their community or the loss of land if they stand by the truth,&rdquo; Swazuri said.He said the boundary of Shartuka Land Adjudication section set on December 5, 1973, and that of Njipship Land Adjudication section set on July 27, 1982. had not been changed. Original maps will be used in demarcating the land and the law followed to the letter, he said.Swazuri said they found out subdivision at the Shartuka Group Ranch was not fairly done because each of the 334 members was supposed to get 51 acres.He said that on the ground it was clear some members did not get any land, some got a larger share, others a small share and some non-members were allocated land at the expense of members.He said they will scrap illegal and overlapping title deeds and recover land for public utilities.
