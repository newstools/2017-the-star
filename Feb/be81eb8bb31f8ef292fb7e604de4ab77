Maasais living in Kajiado East on Monday said no non-local should seek an elective position in Kajiado county. More than 400 members of the Kaputiei section of the community made the declaration outside the Isinya Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission offices.They said elective positions belong to the Maasais and there cannot be compromise. Spokesperson Jonathan Nasoore said those who will attempt to go against the declaration will do so at their &ldquo;own risk&rdquo;.&ldquo;This is a Maasai county and it has come to our knowledge that the people who we allowed to buy land in Kajiado are now growing horns and want to grab leadership from the indigenous people,&rdquo; he said.The leaders, who were later joined by Governor David Nkedianye, urged the IEBC to transfer Kajiado East constituency elections coordinator Rosaline Kasale, claiming she is &ldquo;biased&rdquo; and &ldquo;favours some particular candidates&rdquo;. But Kasale said she stands for transparency. She said she does not have favourite candidates. Kasale said her bosses decide where to work.
