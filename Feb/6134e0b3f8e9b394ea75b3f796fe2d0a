Multi-talented singer June Gachui werars many hats. She is a lawyer by profession, but a thespian, and musician by calling! Referred as one of the most sought after entertainers, she is one known to bring her soul and passion into any act she is involved in. She hosted a theatre experience dubbed All Of June where she performed at a sold out event. She rocked the stage in a show that she promised would be "a melange of art forms &ndash; never seen before!" And that it was.
