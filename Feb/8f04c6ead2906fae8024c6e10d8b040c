Milk processor Brookside says the ongoing training of dairy farmers on hay production in Bungoma and Trans Nzioa counties is aimed at increasing milk output to an average of 10 litres a day from three litres. Director for procurement John Gethi in a statement yesterday said the Ruiru-based company, Kenya&rsquo;s largest by market share, will provide a guaranteed market for raw milk in Mt Elgon region. &ldquo;We have identified hay production and preservation as a key area in ensuring that milk volumes remain optimum across all seasons,&rdquo; Gethi said. Ravaging drought has reduced the output of raw milk, with Brookside now buying at Sh3 more. &ldquo;Brookside is investing in sustainable agriculture practices for farmers, including animal feed preparation and storage as one way of addressing seasonal fluctuation in milk production,&rdquo; he said.
