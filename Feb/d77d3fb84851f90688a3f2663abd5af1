Popular TV journalist Roncliff Odit is thanking his lucky stars for escaping a freak accident with his life.&nbsp;"Yesterday morning, I was driving from Nairobi to Mombasa with my brother Kevin Odit, the wife Sheila Odit, daughter Lesey and their house help, Karen. When we drove past Voi, I hit a pot hole and the tire burst. I lost control of the car and rammed into an oncoming tanker and hit it's second axle. It was bad. I'm grateful that no life was lost," Roncliff told Word Is.&nbsp;He was travelling to Mombasa to be with the girlfriend. The trip also saw him ferry his brother and the family to the coast after a family meeting. The accident occured at 5:40am on Sunday morning.&nbsp;Roncliff is still riling from the accident, he posted on Facebook, "How I managed to come out of this KCG is still a miracle. But the Most High ensured I lived to tell the story. Kevin Odit, Sheila Kevins, Karen and the little girl Kelsie are so fortunate to be alive. And after 6 X-rays and an Ultrasound, its time to relax and wait for another drive."&nbsp;Ronclif told Word Is that he was discharged yesterday evening from Mombasa Hospital after it was determined that he is okay but he is still on pain medication.&nbsp;Here is Roncliff's account of the accident.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
