Survivors of the 2011 Sinai slum fire that claimed at least 102 lives have lost their fight for Sh25 billion compensation.The fire broke out after flammable oil leaked from a malfunctioning pipe at the Kenya Pipeline depot into the densely populated settlement.Those who were hospitalised for long periods after September 12 tragedy wanted the court to award them damages for loss of livelihood.Justice Edward Muriithi said on Monday that the court was sympathetic but that compensation was impossible since they did not file a proper suit.Muriithi said they would each have to prove their loss and establish liability for the order to be granted.&ldquo;I am unable to find that the petitioner has made a case that shows failure by the respondent to protect rights guaranteed under the constitution&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;It's not possible on the basis of the material before me to discern any failure on the part of the respondent to fulfill their constitutional obligations."He found no merit in the petition and therefore dismissed it.Read: Sinai fire victim breaks courtroom door after compensation case fails to take offBut the judge directed the Nairobi government to include Sinai settlement in the slum upgrading programme. He said this would allow relocation or compensation to clear the Kenya Pipeline wayleave."Residents may be moved subject to adequate and reasonable notice," he said.On October 31 2014, the court temporarily stopped the planned eviction of residents from the area after Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko, who was then Makadara MP, filed the suit on behalf of the survivors.Mureithi was of the view that the defunct city council took reasonable measures to meet the victim&rsquo;s obligations.Read: Sonko files medical report in Sh25 billion Sinai fire caseAlso read: Sonko has 300 Sinai fire witnesses in Sh25 billion suit
