Water CS Eugene Wamalwa will not run for any elective seat at the August 8 poll. Instead, he will campaign for Jubilee and be its point man in Western. Wamalwa is said to have been prevailed upon by President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto not to run. He has been promised a Cabinet position should JP win. On Monday during a meeting with Bungoma aspirants in Webuye, Wamalwa said he will traverse the region to woo residents to back UhuRuto.&ldquo;I will be coming down with all the force to ensure Jubilee sweeps most of the seats in Western,&rdquo; he said. Wamalwa dismissed NASA for viewing Western as its stronghold. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard people move around bragging they have support in this region. Let them brace themselves for a mother of all battles .&rdquo; he said
