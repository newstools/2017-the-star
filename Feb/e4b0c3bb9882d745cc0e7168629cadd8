Deputy President William Ruto has dismissed the opposition for opposing a request by the Jubilee Party that the IEBC conduct its primaries.&ldquo;We are consulting the IEBC with a view to seeking its services in conducting our primaries because it is our constitutional right to seek the agency&rsquo;s services on matters of nominations,&rdquo; he said.Addressing Jubilee leaders from Nyamira county at his Karen office yesterday, Ruto said it is within the jurisdiction of the commission to accept or refuse the proposal.The leaders included former MPs Walter Nyambati, Catherine Nyamato and East African Legislative Assembly&rsquo;s Joseph Kiangoi, several MCAs and youth leaders.Ruto said credible national elections can only be achieved if parties conduct fair nominations. He said sham primaries are the greatest threat to democracy. &ldquo;We want to carry out free, fair, credible and open nominations that meet the expectation of Kenyans. This is the only way of building strong political parties,&rdquo; he said.The DP urged Jubilee aspirants not to be scared of the party&rsquo;s interim officials, who have been mandated to run its offices at the county level because they have no say on nominations.&ldquo;Although our party&rsquo;s officials at the grassroots have no say on matters of nominations, it is also advisable for them to conduct their business in a neutral manner not to create suspicion among the aspirants, that they are likely to favour so and so during nominations,&rdquo; Ruto said.He urged the leaders to take the lead in selling JP policies to Nyamira people, saying the party has serious, credible and practical plans for the country. Ruto said the Jubilee coalition resolved to bring together all its affiliate parties under the Jubilee Party and would not be held back in its efforts to attain development and unite Kenyans. He said Jubilee is on a solid path to achieve complete transformation in economic, health, education, water, energy, infrastructure and agriculture, among other sectors.Ruto cited the Sh800 million allocated for Nyamira county to upgrade and equip two hospitals to provide specialised healthcare.He said the number of people with electricity connection has risen from 15,000 in 2013 to 45,000 in less than four years since the Jubilee administration took over.
