Robert Ombasa has been appointed acting Kisii county secretary and head of County Public Service Board. He replaces Johnstone Ndege who resigned to run for North Mugirango MP. Ombasa served as the principal administrative secretary and deputised Ndege. Ombasa is from South Mugirango constituency. In a pre-2013 election agreement, South Mugirango was to get the position of the county secretary, a promise Ongwae has fulfilled, albeit late.
