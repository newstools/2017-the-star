Voter apathy in Homa Bay is worrying and less than half the target voters have been listed, with only three days remaining to register, Governor Cyprian Awiti has said.The IEBC targeted to register 130,000 new voters in the county in the month-long mass voter registration that began on January 16 and ends on Tuesday.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not pleased with the number the IEBC says they have managed to enlist. We are told only 41 per cent were registered by the third week,&rdquo; Awiti said.Speaking to journalists in Homa Bay town on Wednesday, he urged residents who do not have IDs to urgently apply and register to vote.The governor urged all adults with IDs to also get voter's cards.&ldquo;Let those with waiting cards do the same by following up their applications to get the IDs and register as voters because time is not on our side,&rdquo; he said.The county boss urged Homa Bay leaders to put aside differences and together encourage residents to register to vote.
