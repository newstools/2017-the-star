Cord has claimed that at the last general election, the presidential vote exceeded other positions voted for by almost 2 million votes.These are votes that were added both in areas where Uhuru Kenyatta was expected to get overwhelming support and marginalized areas where scrutiny is minimal.Cord also claimed that during collation, tallying and transmission of results, further cooking of votes was done &ndash; with more votes for Uhuru declared and admitted by the IEBC than what was officially declared at the polling/stream centre.Election rigging starts with the character, structure and appointment of the electoral management body. Rigging starts with voter registration, using the state machine levers and institutions, voting and tallying. The role of voter registration is very important when it comes to the credibility and integrity of elections. It can make or break an election.The quality of the process and the product &ndash; that is, the Voters&rsquo; Roll &ndash; can determine the outcome of an election and consequently the stability of the democratic institutions in a country.When Cote d&rsquo;Ivoire compiled a new register, provisional figures indicated a drop in the voter population from some 8 million to a little above 6 million. Nigeria significantly revised its Biometric Voter Register with the issuance of Permanent Voter cards (a voter ID with a biometric chip of the voter&rsquo;s unique details, which required the voter going to the INEC to be biometrically verified before picking up his new electronic voter ID). This alone reduced Nigeria&rsquo;s voter population from 74 million in 2011 to 68 million in 2015, contributing to the cleanest and most peaceful election in Nigeria&rsquo;s recent history.The evidence is that the methodology used by the IEBC to compile must provide for a transparent, effective, efficient and sustainable exercise. To ignore this evidence is to endanger electoral democracy. The single most important legal repercussion on the health of the final register is determining what method or methods are to be used to unequivocally determine that a person coming to a polling station is a valid voter that complies with all the requirements mandated by law.The Voter&rsquo;s Register is bloated for two main reasons: too many dead people on the list and the voter ID serving as a national ID card for everybody, including foreigners.Executive Director, International Center for Policy and Conflict
