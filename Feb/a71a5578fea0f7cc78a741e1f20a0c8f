Meru Senator Kiraitu Murungi (pictured) says Embu Senator Lenny Kivuti&rsquo;s defection to Governor Alfred Mutua&rsquo;s Maendeleo Chap Chap is unfortunate. He said,&ldquo;I was very disturbed to learn Kivuti had moved to MCC. We have to admit we are a democratic country and when people defect, they are exercising their democratic right. I can&rsquo;t condemn anybody for that.&rdquo;
