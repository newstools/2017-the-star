Five Kiambu governor aspirants have resolved to form one team to face incumbent William Kabogo.They are Kabete MP Ferdinand Waititu, businessman James Nyoro, real estate mogul James Kariuki, trader John Mugwe and businesswoman Aquiline Njoki. Speaking at a peace prayer rally in Thika&rsquo;s St Patrick&rsquo;s Grounds on Saturday, the hopefuls said they have been urged by residents to unite.Nyoro said their unity will enable Kiambu to regain its former glory. Waititu said they will meet and come up with a proper line-up to ensure they clinch the seat. He said the line-up will be announced to the public later this month, when they will intensify campaigns across the county. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re uniting to clinch the seat and form a government to work for residents. Every one of us will have a position in that government,&rdquo; Waititu said.MPs Kigo Njenga (Gatundu North), Jude Njomo (Kiambu) and Alice Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a (Thika Town) attended the rally and pledged their support.But in a quick rejoinder, Kabogo dismissed the union. He said his rivals are trying to pull a NASA &ldquo;after experiencing heat on the ground&rdquo;. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy they are in a panic mode. It does not shake me at all. It instead gives me the courage to soldier on.&rdquo;
