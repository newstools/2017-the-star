Narok West MP Patrick Ntutu has defected from Jubilee. He was expected to run for Narok governor on the party&rsquo;s ticket. Speaking at a rally at Soget shopping centre, Trans Mara East subcounty on Tuesday, Ntutu said he left Jubilee after wide consultations with his supporters. He was accompanied by Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto and Emurua Dikirr MP Johana Ng&rsquo;eno, Ntutu, who has been linked to Gideon Moi&rsquo;s Kanu and Rutto&rsquo;s Chama Cha Mashinani, did not, however, announce which of the two outfits he will use to vie for governor. He promised to work closely with Governor Rutto and Ng&rsquo;eno . &ldquo;I have traversed the entire county in the recent past and my supporters have advised me against competing with Governor Samuel Tunai in the Jubilee primaries if I want to be the next county boss,&rsquo;&rsquo; Ntutu said. Moi, Rutto, Ntutu and Ng&rsquo;eno are said to have met in the Masai Mara at the weekend where they resolved to work together ahead of August polls. Governor Rutto and Ng&rsquo;eno welcomed Ntutu&rsquo;d decision, saying he is now guaranteed of being the next Narok governor. They also promised to campaign for him. &ldquo;I am asking President Uhuru Kenyatta to talk to the people of the South Rift directly if he wants our votes instead of sending political brokers, who are only working for his downfall. They don&rsquo;t respect elected leaders and the people of this region,&rsquo;&rsquo; Governor Rutto said.
