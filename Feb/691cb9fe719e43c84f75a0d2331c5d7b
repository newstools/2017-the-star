Chaos erupted in Bomet town on Saturday evening soon after NASA leaders ended their rally.A section of Jubilee supporters who had repeatedly tried to disrupt the meeting in vain retreated to the central business district, where they regrouped and burnt tyres on the streets and main highway.The group of more than 300 youths engaged police in running battles for more than an hour, throwing stones and snatching caps, reflector jackets and any material belonging to NASA and Governor Isaac Rutto&rsquo;s Chama Cha Mashinani party from supporters leaving the meeting.Police had to lob teargas canisters to disperse the youths who brought business to a halt in some parts of the town for the better part of the evening.Chanting Jubilee songs, the youths who later addressed the press, said Bomet is a Jubilee zone. They told opposition leaders who visit the county for rallies to respect Jubilee.Led by Victor Rop, the youths accused the opposition of using the meeting to attack Deputy President William Ruto.&ldquo;Here in Bomet we are members of Jubilee, so Rutto should stop moving around bragging about how he has allegedly managed to convince the electorate to join CCM yet we know he only has a few followers in the region,&rdquo; he said.Rutto was forced to calm the crowd down several times as Jubilee supporters stood outside the stadium chanting JP slogans.He accused county commissioner Bernard Leparmarai of encouraging the youths to cause disorder.
