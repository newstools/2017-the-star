Mandera Kenya National Union of Teachers branch has asked the government to release the National Government Constituency Development Fund bursary funds to schools to avert a looming education crisis in the region.Branch executive secretary Mohamed Sheikh yesterday said many students have dropped out of school due to lack of fees. He spoke in Mandera town.Sheikh said due to the devastating drought, livestock in the region are emaciated and cannot fetch good cash.&ldquo;Many of our cattle are almost dying due to the ravaging drought. We can&rsquo;t sell them at a good price, enough to pay school fees for our children. Some parents are now forced to let their children stay at home, &ldquo; Sheikh said.&ldquo;If MPs fail to release these funds, the situation will worsen with more students dropping out,&rdquo; the Knut official said.He also asked the government to give food subsidies to schools. &ldquo;Many of our schools are finding it hard to feed students due to the high food prices. Suppliers are now being forced to transport food from Nairobi, which leaves them with no option but to hike the prices of goods, especially cereals,&rdquo; he said. Mandera county is yet to release bursary funds for the First Term, despite many parents being unable to pay fees. He said boarding schools also risk imminent closure if the current water crisis is not solved.
