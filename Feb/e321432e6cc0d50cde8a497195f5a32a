Bumula MP Boniface Otsiula has urged his colleagues to support the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill. The Bill entrenches the National Government Constituency Development Fund, the Affirmative Fund and Senate Oversight Fund in the constitution.&ldquo;As it is now the Finance Cabinet Secretary, who has always been opposed to the funds, can even lobby to have the funds scrapped, despite the enormous stories of CDF successes,&rdquo; Otsiula said.He spoke on Tuesday at Khasoko Boys&rsquo; High School in Bungoma county. Otsiula said CDF has transformed lives through projects in education, health, security, roads and provision of clean water.&ldquo;If you want senators to do proper oversight for the counties they must be given adequate funds to move around the counties, otherwise they will be compromised by corrupt governors,&rdquo; he said.The bill is set for the second reading after the 90 days for public participation elapsed on Tuesday. Senators and woman representatives have demanded funds of their own. Many senators have opted to run for governor and MP rather than seek reelection.
