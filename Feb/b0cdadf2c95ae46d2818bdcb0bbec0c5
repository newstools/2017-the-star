Musalia Mudavadi&rsquo;s ANC is reaping big in Bungoma county as JP, Ford Kenya and ODM defectors join the party.In the past two weeks alone, more than 20 MCAs out of the county&rsquo;s 45 have defected to ANCThey include former minority leader John Musakali (JP), majority whip Bethwel Mwambu (JP), PAC chairman John Nanyakha, Chritsantus Wehuli (JP), Elima Nalianya, Joseph Nyongesa and Martin Pepela of ODM.Others are David Fwaro, Julius Barasa and Moses Wakala.MP hopefuls who have defected from Ford Kenya include Joseph Wataka (Sirisia), Peter Makokha (Kimilili), Vitalis Musebe (Webuye West) and Michael Walekhwa (Webuye West).Speaking to the Star yesterday, Bungoma ANC secretary Martin Waliula said the defectors have paid membership fees.&ldquo;They have signed up as life members,&rdquo; he said.Waliula said more have shown interest and will be officially received by party leader Mudavadi when he visits the county this week.&ldquo;The party leader will host several rallies and receive defectors,&rdquo; he said.Observers opine the defectors might be fearing being locked out of the Augut 8 poll if they fail in the primaries.&ldquo;Most people fear going into the rigorous nominations. That&rsquo;s why you will see most sitting politicians ditching their parties for new upcoming parties,&rdquo; Human rights activist Philip Wanyonyi said.Trans Nzoia Governor Patrick Khaemba has also indicated he will ditch Ford Kenya for ANC. Reliable sources indicate he has already paid up to be a life member of ANC. He cited frustrations and a witch-hunt in Ford Kenya.The massive defection could give Mudavadi a tighter grip on the Western vote bloc as he prepares to make a second stab at the presidency through the NASA outfit.He will, however, have to battle out for the alliance&rsquo;s ticket with other presidential hopefuls Raila Odinga, Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula, Kalonzo Musyoka and others who might join during the run-up to August 8 election.Wetang&rsquo;ula and Ford-K deputy leader Boni Khalwale initially opposed NASA and instead urged its proponent, Mudavadi, to join Cord. They backed down after Raila and Kalonzo supported the outfit.On Thursday, political analyst Martin Andati said, &ldquo;The candidate picked as the flagbearer will either solidify the opposition&rsquo;s unity or cause serious voter apathy in perceived opposition strongholds that may favour Jubilee.&rdquo;He said the low turnout during voter listing in opposition zones is because its candidate has not been announced.Andati said, &ldquo;Luhyas are the largest vote bloc in the opposition and will not accept to be flower girls in NASA.&rdquo;Analyst Martin Oloo said the Tosha slogan will not work this time, as it did in 2002, &ldquo;because the dynamics are different.&rdquo;
