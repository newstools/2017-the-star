Taxpayers will be forced to cough Sh3.1 billion as pension for MPs who served between 1984 and 2002.The Finance and Planning Committee recommended that the 370 former lawmakers be paid a monthly pension of Sh100,000 backdated to July 2010.Each former legislator will walk away with Sh8.4 million for the seven years and Sh100,000 monthly stipend for the rest of their lives. Currently, the monthly pension for the MPs who served between 1984 and 2002 is between Sh2,700 and Sh40,000.The committee said the pension is a huge mismatch with the current economic circumstances, particularly the cost of living.The number of MPs who served during the period was estimated to be 500, but some have died, bringing the number to 370.SH37M STIPENDParliament will have to budget for Sh37 million monthly, going forward, as stipend for the former legislators. The recommendations by the Finance Committee follow a public petition on implementation of the 2009 Akiwumi tribunal report on minimum living pension for former MPs. The Akiwumi tribunal was appointed by Parliament on January 2009 to review terms and conditions of service for MPs and staff at the National Assembly.PENDING FOR 7 YEARSParliament debated and adopted the report on June 30, 2010, but the implementation of the report has been pending for seven years. The Former Parliamentarians Association of Kenya petitioned Parliament to effect the recommendations.Their petition was presented by Rarieda MP Nicholas Gumbo in October last year.To give legal effect to the payout, the panel chaired by Ainamoi MP Benjamin Langat proposed amendments to the Parliamentary Pensions Act, Cap 196.The committee wants the National Treasury to avail funds to pay the former MPs within the 2017-18 financial year. The paltry pension is attributed to the low salaries the MPs were paid at the time of their service.
