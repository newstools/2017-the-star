Kitui Governor Julius Malombe on Friday said he deserves a second term because of his unparalleled development record.He said in 2022 he would hand over the county leadership to a younger and more energetic successor. Malombe said it would be retrogressive for him to have an older person as his successor.&ldquo;I cannot bring myself to terms with the prospect of handing over the baton to a person who is older than me. It would be a grievous mistake for the Kitui people,&rdquo; he said.The governor said a &ldquo;sluggish&rdquo; heir would slow down development. Malombe spoke as he closed a week-long consultative meeting between executives and the assembly at a Nairobi hotel. The leaders had come together to take stock of county achievements.The 62-year-old governor is being challenged for the governorship by Senator David Musila, 74, and former Lands Cabinet Secretary Charity Ngilu, 65. He said a progressive society must always hand over leadership to younger successors.
