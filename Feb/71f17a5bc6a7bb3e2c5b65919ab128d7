The Senator also said the bumps resulted in huge traffic snarl-ups and accused Kidero of failing to provide alternative routes.Odunga said there was no rationale for erecting rumble strips and bumps yet footbridges were available.He said Kenha was legally obligated to remove the "offending" strips and bumps, and the county mandated with facilitating the process.The judge noted there was no public participation before the decision to decongest the city was made.But he said reversing the effect of what has been undertaken would cause more harm than effects of failure to comply with the law.&ldquo;Where it becomes necessary for members of the public to be inconvenienced, the public ought to be notified in good time and the approximate period for the said inconvenience stated," he said.&ldquo;Those tasked with the management of the roads in this country are obliged to ensure proper signage and inform road users of the state of roads so they can make informed decisions in good time."Odunga said the periods of inconvenience must be absolutely necessary so that the constitution is not violated.The judge also noted it was the responsibility of the executive to ensure footbridges are secure, but regretted that thugs had taken over.Odunga also said the county government failed to carry out its statutory obligation of constituting the management board and appointing the managers.[VIDEO] Nairobi set for new transit buses in decongestion plan - KideroAlso read: Presidents Uhuru and Magufuli open Southern Bypass to decongest city
