Former Gem MP Joe Donde has endorsed the reelection of Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga and urged MPs to follow suit.He told off Rasanga&rsquo;s critics, including Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo and Rarieda MP Nicholas Gumbo, and instead urged them to back the incumbent. Gumbo is also in the race for the county top job. Donde said on Friday Midiwo and Gumbo are beneficiaries of his intercession in the last election, which led to their reelection, despite a rebellion from residents.&ldquo;Midiwo had problems with the electorate when we were campaigning for Rasanga, but we made sure he was reelected,&rdquo; he said.Midiwo has said he will not support Rasanga&rsquo;s reelection. He is backing William Oduol and Gumbo&rsquo;s pact.Donde said he used his unrivalled development record to persuade residents to reelect Midiwo. He spoke in Akala, Gem constituency, during a groundbreaking ceremony to construct a factory for locally produced oil.Donde, who is the Siaya County Public Service Board chairperson, said through his influence, he worked hard with peope he did not name to ensure Gumbo was reelected, hence breaking the jinx that Rarieda MPs only served for one term.&ldquo;Gumbo had problems and we had to convene a meeting in Rarieda, where he was reelected,&rdquo; Donde said, adding that Rasanga should not be an exception at the August 8 poll.Rasanga, who was present at the function, shared similar sentiments, saying Donde played a crucial role in introducing him to politicsat a time he was a greenhorn from the public service.The governor said facing the public was a tall order as he was not born an orator.He said he would not have managed it if it were not for the support he received from the likes of Donde.Rasanga told residents he will consider them for available jobs once he is reelected.He has been on the receiving end in this constituency for falling out with Midiwo over alleged corruption in his administration.He struck a reconciliatory tone saying Gem is not fully represented in the county when it comes to the number of residents employed. Rasanga blamed this on officers he did not name, but whom he accused of frustrating Donde&rsquo;s efforts to hire more from Gem. &ldquo;Starting a government that is all-inclusive is not easy. Donde can attest to this after being in public service for long,&rdquo; he said.Other leaders present at the event included Siaya woman representative Christine Ombaka and Education executive Jalang&rsquo;o Midiwo.
