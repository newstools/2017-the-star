Kenya is ranked among countries that are technically food-secure, despite the severe drought and at least three million starving people. Poor distribution, lack of infrastructure and lack of storage are major reasons food doesn&rsquo;t reach hungry people, says the Global Food Security Index. It is part of the Economist Intelligence Unit.Its global report says, &ldquo;Countries that prioritise investment in agricultural, storage and transport infrastructure increase their capacity to ensure food security for growing populations.&rdquo; It also cited problems of corruption and lack of expenditure on research and development in Kenya and other developing countries. Investment, especially by the private sector, is critical if countries are to develop infrastructure capacity, which is key to producing and transporting sufficient food in the future, it said. The report considers affordability, availability and quality in 113 countries by measuring 28 indicators.Kenya ranks 83rd, behind Uganda and Ghana. The report says 89 of 113 countries have improved food security over five years, though hunger and shortages persist in many developing countries.The study attributes improved security to rising incomes and general improvements in the global economy, resulting in lower food prices.However, the study says, &ldquo;Weather, climate change and market distortion by government policies pose a risk to food availability and prices in future.&rdquo;People in 23 Kenyan counties are suffering lack of food, many are hungry, some starving. Many livestock have died in the drought. The meteorological department says the drought is likely to continue. Low, inadequate rains are expected in the March-April-May long-rain season and food security is likely to deteriorate over most regions, especially the north. The water shortage will continue and malnutrition is likely to worsen, say weather and health experts.
