Prisons assistant coach Josp Barasa acknowledged the move was aimed to beef up the squad as they look forward to reclaim the trophy they last won in 2013.Barasa, who doubles up as the under-23 women&rsquo;s volleyball team assistant coach, said with the new players joining the current squad, the former champions are set to begin the title quest on a high.&ldquo;We begun our training session on Monday and the new players have the passion and have shown the will to learn. All we are doing now is to ensure they gel well ahead of the season. Our attacking and reception was wanting last year and that&rsquo;s what we are working on right now besides strengthening other departments,&rdquo; said Barasa.He added: &ldquo;Last season, we begun the title hunt on positive note, winning all our regular league matches but succumbed to our stubborn but worth opponent Kenya Pipeline in the play-offs staged in Makande Hall, Mombasa. But this time around, we are focused and we want to go all the way and reclaim the title.&rdquo;Prisons are scheduled to play their arch-rival Kenya Pipeline in their first league match in Busia and Barasa remained confident of staging a good show.&ldquo;We have experienced players at our disposal including sensational national team setter Jane Wacu, former national team captain Brackcidise Agala, left attacker Evelyne Makuto, libero Elizabeth Wanyama and right attacker Lydia Maiyo. We are therefore preparing well to begin the league on a winning note,&rdquo; he said. He added: &ldquo;Besides the league, we also have the forthcoming Africa Club Championship set for Tunisia in April. We didn&rsquo;t post good results during the last edition held in Tunisia and we are keen to make amends this time around.&rdquo;
