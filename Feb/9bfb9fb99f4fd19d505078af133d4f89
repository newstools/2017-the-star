Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter (pictured) is leading MPs in pushing to have a special fund established to help patients suffering from chronic disease, including cancer, blood pressure, heart ailments and kidney failure. Keter says the move will reduce medical expenses incurred by patients suffering from life-threatening diseases. The MP says he will soon table the Medical Fund Bill.
