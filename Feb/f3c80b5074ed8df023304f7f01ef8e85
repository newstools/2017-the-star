South Mugirango MP Manson Nyamweya yesterday urged Kenyans not elect civil service retirees.He said Kenyans who earn pensions should allow young people to run for election since they have more energy.&ldquo;I am urging you to ignore people who have retired from the civil service because they have nothing to offer Kenyans,&rdquo; Nyamweya said. &ldquo;They should eat their pension. It is good to give the young generation an opportunity to lead.&rdquo;The KNC leader was addressing more than 300 delegates from Nyaribari Masaba at the party offices in Nyamataro on the outskirts of Kisii town.Nyamweya urged Kisii residents to elect him governor, saying his track record as an MP is excellent. &ldquo;I have done a lot in my constituency since I was elected n 2010, that is I why decided to vie for a higher seat,&rdquo; he said.Nyamweya said former CIC chairman Charles Nyachae would have been his only worry &ldquo;... if he had declared his interest in the governor seat because he had about 100,000 votes to begin with. But I do not worry anymore because he will be going for the Senate,&rdquo; he said.Those seeking to unseat incumbent James Ongwae include Senator Chris Obure, Deputy Governor Joash Maangi and lawyer Patrick Lumumba Nyaberi.Nyamweya, Obure and Nyaberi have identified their running mates, while Ongwae and Maangi are still searching. Obure has named Albert Nyaundi from Bomachoge Borabu while Nyaberi has picked Charles Birundu from Nyaribari. Nyamweya said if elected, he will ensure each village is connected with piped water and build roads.He accused President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s administration of condoning corruption.
