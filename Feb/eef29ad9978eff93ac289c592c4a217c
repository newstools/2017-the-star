Twelve counties in Western Kenya, under the Lake Basin Economic block, yesterday opened a four-day exhibition that seeks to attract big-ticket investors to the hugely under-invested region. The Lake Basin Expo and Investment Summit is showcasing opportunities in Kisumu, Homa Bay, Migori, Siaya, Kisii, Nyamira, Kakamega, Busia, Vihiga, Bungoma, Trans Nzoia, Kericho and Bomet.Investors from the USA, China, European Union, Canada, Turkey, Israel, Egypt, South Africa, Tanzania, Kenya, Iran and India will showcase their multi-sectorial opportunities for investment. Adamant Group chief executive Isaac Mokara said the forum aims to unleash the entrepreneurship potential to better tackle regional, national and county challenges. &ldquo;It's also aimed at transforming communities, creating jobs and spurring growth by shutting the opportunity gap that confronts far too many people in the region,&rdquo; Mokara said. He said business entrepreneurs, government and power of markets can drastically increase the talent and resources available to sustain and solve critical problems. Mokaya said the exhibition will also provide an opportunity to open and exploit the tourism circuit available in the regions. &ldquo;We want to unlock the tourism potentials we have around the bloc as we strive to turn them into viable investment opportunities, he said. He added that the exhibition whose theme is &lsquo;unlocking the entrepreneurship potentials existing in the region&rsquo;, seeks to empower the Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), the youth and women. At least 2,000 delegates and more than 100 companies drawn locally, regionally and internationally are expected to take part in the summit. The trade fair event is co-organized by Kenya National chamber of commerce, Local Capacities for Peace (a non profit making organization), Kenya Vision 2030, Ken Invest and Aramant group and will bring together twelve counties under the economic bloc.
