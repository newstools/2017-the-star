Siaya Senator James Orengo has remained tight lipped on which political seat he will be going for in the August elections. Orengo has kept potential aspirants for both the seat of the Senate and governor wide guessing on his next course of action after he is reportedly to have paid the nomination fees for both the governor and the Senate.According to Ugunja parliamentary aspirant Otieno Alur, a close confidante to Orengo ,said he is still tight lipped with Orengo&rsquo;s action and silence to publicly declare the seat he intends to vie for.&ldquo;I understand that he paid both fees for the Senate and governor positions,&rdquo; added Alur saying that could be part of his political schemes.Ukwala ward MCA aspirant Peter Omondi confirmed having attended a meeting late last year where Orengo was in the process to announce his intentions to vie for Siaya governor seat.Omondi confidently disclosed that Orengo was to make the maiden speech at his Ramunde home on December 26 which has since remained elusive to date.Gem MP, Jakoyo Midiwo, a key ally of Orengo has on numerous occasions claimed that he aware of the Senator&rsquo;s intention to vie for the seat of the governor.&ldquo;Orengo and former Siaya County council chairman Aggrey Onyango visited me at home and I asked Orengo if he was going to vie for governor seat but he declined,&rdquo; added Midiwo during a past morning radio talk show on radio Ramogi.The Senator&rsquo;s intention to vie for the governor seat has put both incumbent governor&rsquo;s Cornel Rasanga and William Oduol, Nicholas Gumbo and Carey Orege&rsquo;s camp between a rock and a hard place.All the aspirants are currently grappling with trying to fence ring the swing votes of the former Ugenya constituency that comprises Ugunja which Orengo commands with almost a religious zeal.Rasanga&rsquo;s in-laws come from West Ugenya but his soured relations with Orengo might work against his vote search in the region if the Senator either decides to vie for the governor seat or opt to support a rival.Following the development, only nominated MCA representing people with disabilities Margret Okech has openly declared to vie for the Senate seat while the rest of potential aspirants have opted to reserve their arsenals until the opportune time comes.In 2013, A US nun Agnes Awuor challenged Orengo for the Senate seat only to lose dismally at the nomination stages, she has since not been seen in the political limelight again.Orengo during the burial of the South Africa based scholar Prof Rok Ajulu in Bondo in January this year remained non committal over the issue when hard pressed by the media to disclose his intentions.Orengo claimed that the Siaya politics will take shape at the opportune time saying that the vigor and much impetus should be focused on how to consolidate overwhelmingly votes for Cord leader Raila Odinga.Political pundits claim that the veteran politician is scheming to use the outcome of the NASA formation and consequently the sending off of the former IEBC as a platform to bargain for his preferred political seat.&ldquo;I know Orengo will convince Raila that after burning the mid night oil to send IEBC packing and brokering a truce with other co principals, he will want to be rewarded with a governor position,&rdquo; added Mwanga Ugenya politician who has worked closely with Orengo in the past.
