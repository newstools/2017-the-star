Nairobi Gymkhana and Kongonis will be hoping to capitalise on the internal woes facing Sikh Union to boost their chances of qualifying for the semi-finals of the 2017 Nairobi Provincial Cricket Association (NPCA) Twenty20 tournament this weekend.Sikh Union have been rocked with a row between the playing unit and the management, forcing the club to turn to the second string players for their remaining league matches.After failing to field a team against Swamibapa and Ruaraka two weeks ago, the club which is being accused by the players for not honouring their promises and mistreating some of them, opted to field their second team for their matches against Stray Lions and Kanbis last weekend.And if Sikhs&rsquo; performance in the last two matches is anything to by, then Nairobi Gymkhana and Kongonis should brace themselves up for easy outings.Sikh Union batsmen failed to trouble the scorers as they lost wickets easily against Stray Lion and Kanbis&rsquo; bowling. Considering their current form, Sikh Union will be in for a long weekend as their opponents seek points in a bid to qualify for the knockout stage. With defending champions Swamibapa, leaders Stray Lions and former champions Kanbis almost assured a place in the last four, Gymkhana, who are cross-road neighbours to Sikh Union, know very well that any slip up could blow up their qualification chances.They will heavily bank on captain Karan Kaul to win the match. The captain has played key role in every match irrespective of the results. At Nairobi Club, hosts Kongonis will equally capitalise on Sikh Union&rsquo;s predicaments to end their long losing streak against the former finalists. Kongonis have for sometimes now remained one of the most inconsistent teams in the league and victory will no doubt give them a lifeline. Kongonis all-rounder Emmanuel Opura said they will not underrate their guests but will instead take the match with the seriousness it deserves as they chase maximum points.&ldquo;Whichever way we look at it, Sikh Union will be competitive. Their performance last weekend doesn&rsquo;t mean they will be an easy side. They are definitely going to fight and we must be on the lookout,&rdquo; Opura said.In the other match of the day, table-toppers Stray Lions will look to consolidate their position when they take on Ruaraka at Peponi.The last time the two teams met, Stray Lions had an easy six wickets win.
