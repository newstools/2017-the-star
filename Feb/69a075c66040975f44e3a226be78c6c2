On August 5, 1995, just a few metres from a Danish UN camp in Dvor, Croatia, nine disabled and elderly people &mdash; Serbs and Croats &mdash; were shot dead by unidentified men in camouflage, as the peacekeepers watched and did nothing. Which raises the question of the integrity and the credibility of the highly bureaucratic organisation, the United Nations. The Danish soldiers were assigned by the UN to monitor the ceasefire between the Serbs and the Croats and were only allowed to use weapons in self-defence. This incident has been an unidentified incident in the broadcasts of the world. It has simply been pushed under the carpet of the UN shield, but why?The Croatian army ceasefire had broken and 250,000 Serbs were forced to flee during "Operation Storm&rdquo;. This generated chaos in the environs of Dvor, leading to an immediate problem. As there was no longer a ceasefire to monitor, the soldiers were ordered to stay inside the camp and not to intervene. They were ordered to let the happenings take place the way they did. It was up to the Danish commanding officer, Jorgen Kold, to make the crucial decision: either to give orders to shoot the killers or follow the UN mandate and not intervene. He chose the latter and has been plagued with guilt ever since.The documentary, The 15-Minute Massacre in Croatia, is about Kold on his journey back to Croatia, to the place where he had to make the most difficult decision of his life. Here he confronts his past - by meeting the commanders from the warring parties and the victims' relatives.He is forced to face difficult questions: Could he have stopped the massacre? Did he have a choice? Or were he, the Danish soldiers and the civilians let down by the UN?We have perceived the UN as a body that upholds peace and unity. However, from this story, we really question: what other skeletons might the United Nations have in their closet?
