US President Donald Trump has accused his predecessor Barack Obama of orchestrating leaks and anti-Republican protests during his first month in office.Trump told Fox News that Obama and his allies were behind the leaking of classified information from White House to the press.He said he believed Obama was behind the chaos and that this may have been for political reasons."His people are certainly behind it. And some of the leaks possibly come from that group, which are really serious because they are very bad in terms of national security," he said.He also said: "You never know what's exactly happening behind the scenes. You know, you're probably right or possibly right, but you never know."The President did not give any evidence to support his claims but said the leaks could continue as they are politically motivated.CNN tried to reach Obama's office but there was no response at the time of going to the press.Last week, Republicans faced angry constituents in town halls and district offices around the country.The action followed protests that erupted at airports in response to the Trump administration&rsquo;s travel ban.The president's January 27 order had barred admission of citizens from the seven nations for 90 days.But Obama weighed in publicly on the political issue, his first since leaving office, and sent out support for the demonstrations."President Obama is heartened by the level of engagement taking place in communities around the country," read a statement released by his post-presidential office.More on this: 'Heartened' Obama chides Trump over US travel banA US appeal court further denied an emergency appeal from the US Department of Justice to restore a immigration order from Trump barring citizens from seven mainly Muslim countries and temporarily banning refugees.The Department filed the appeal a day after a federal judge in Seattle ordered Trump's travel ban to be lifted.
