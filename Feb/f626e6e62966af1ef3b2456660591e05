It's a day before one of the most awaited days on the calendar! Valentine's day. As always, we know how the script&nbsp;goes; Ladies expect a&nbsp;bunch of roses, a box of chocolates, a romantic dinner and a red dress from their significant other (if they're lucky).How about we men? The only thing that I would say men expect on Valentine's day is; receiving long romantic messages at 11:59 pm tonight reminding them how they are the 'one and only', 'valued' and 'one to die for'. One thing for sure is men can expect to go back home broke; as if Njaanuary wasn't horrible enough.But what's in the offing for Mrs. Japanni and what does she have in store for her loving hubby?"Mimi ni mwanamke bwana nangoja kupigwa bonge la surprise," said Massawe without hesitation!&nbsp; "Anyway just the usual but let's just say we have our Valentine's every other day, yeah so I'm looking forward to something different something exciting, I hope I get surprised&nbsp;as usual."She added revealing exactly how romantic her husband is, but is Massawe actually planning to return the favor? " You know I am a romantic fool, I tend to surprise him most of the time this time round yeah probably better." As romantic as she is, the Bustani la MJ presenter did not mince her words when it came to offering her sincere advice to the lovers out there, who are ready to break the bank just to prove their love to their loved ones for just a day.Let's not delve into this Valentine's craze and yet you have a pathetic relationship, love each other respect each other women submit to your men, men love and respect your women, be real don't be all about Valentine's day craze yet on the 13th and 15th of February it will &nbsp;just be empty."
