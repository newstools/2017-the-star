Migori Governor Okoth Obado yesterday dismissed claims of corruption in his administration.Speaking on Radio Mayienga after returning from a visit to Australia, he said the Senate Public Accounts and Investment committee report on financial impropriety in his first year in office entailed audit queries he had already answered.Obado said he cannot be arrested over such allegations and said it was unfair for media and his rival to malign him without reading or making the report available to the public.&ldquo;No money was lost. There&rsquo;s no corruption. They will wait to see me arrested, but it won&rsquo;t happen,&rdquo; he said.The report issued last week requested the EACC and the DPP arrest and charge Obado and seven other governors immediately over misuse of funds.The other governors are Daniel Waithaka (Nyandarua), Jack Ranguma (Kisumu), Moses Lenolkulal (Samburu), Patrick Khaemba (Trans Nzoia), Salim Mvurya (Kwale), Sospeter Ojaamong (Busia) and William Kabogo (Kiambu). The committee said it had gathered watertight evidence to sustain cases against the eight.On Thursday, Citizen TV in its 9pm bulletin listed from the report six corruption scandals in Migori amounting to Sh345.68m. Some Migori residents took snapshots and video clips during the live broadcast and shared them widely on social media. This angered Obado.They included unsurrendered Sh29 million imprests, unsupported Sh14.68 million Kemsa supplies, Sh231 million purchase of motor vehicles, Sh29.7 million for fuel procurement, Sh36.8 million advance payment for ICT projects and Sh4.5 million fuel used for road works equipment.Obado said the story did not paint a complete picture of the report, saying it has a line, &ldquo;which says I had done no wrong&rdquo;. He also said his administration had done no wrong.
