Clinical officers and pharmacists from Machakos Level 5 Hospital held protests on Wednesday to demand payment of their allowances.They questioned why they have not been paid, yet nurses have.The group also complained about being left out in the ongoing negations between doctors and the government.&ldquo;There are 17 cadres of clinical officers, and all of them have been left out of the talks. We feel neglected because we have always worked as a team,&rdquo; worker Boniface Mitambo of the Machakos Level 5 Hospital said.The group demanded to see Governor Alfred Mutua to present a petition which they said they wanted forwarded to the Ministry of Health and the Salaries and Remuneration Commission.Mitambo said it would be unfair to raise the allowances of doctors and leave clinical officers, pharmacists, physicians and the other healthcare professionals out.&ldquo;We are giving the government one month to pay our allowances or we will go on strike,&rdquo; clinical officer Stephen Mulinge said.Addressing the workers outside the governor&rsquo;s office, Health executive Naomi Mutie said discussions are being held to determine allowances.
