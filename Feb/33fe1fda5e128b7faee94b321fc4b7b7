It is promising to be a tight race for the presidency as Jubilee and the opposition shared new voters almost equally in the just-ended registration.An analysis of voter numbers released by the IEBC yesterday show Jubilee strongholds lead opposition zones by less than 50,000 new voters.Counties where President Uhuru Kenyatta won a majority in the 2013 election registered 1,482,437 new voters, while those the opposition won signed up 1,434,632.In the 10 counties in which a narrow margin was won &mdash; and also identified by both camps as battleground zones &mdash; together have 789,730 new voters.However, there are also 29,928 voters who registered at Huduma Centres and 33,783 others who registered in universities and colleges.IEBC announced it had registered 3,782,089 new voters in the 35 days of mass voter registration, against a target of six million.This brings the number of new registered voters since 2013 to six million, in addition to the 14.3 million that had registered at the last election.There are 19,741,174 voters, and the voter registry must be cleaned, reducing the number somewhat..Assuming a similar turnout of 86 per cent as in 2013, 16.93 million should be expected to vote on August 8.The numbers suggest a tight race, especially if the opposition manages to unite behind one candidate to face Uhuru.Both sides have put together teams that are analysing the new numbers and factoring in developments such as defections and shifting alliances.Nairobi led Kiambu, Nakuru, Meru, Mombasa, Kilifi, Machakos, Kakamega, Murang'a, Uasin Gishu counties in registering more than 100,000 voters.Counties surpassing their targets by more than 100 per cent were Kajiado ( 240 per cent), Mandera ( 116 per cent) and Narok ( 102 per cent).IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati said there was a large number of voter transfers and experts would analyse how this would affect poll preparations."We have so far records of 1,001,819 applications. We observed there are places that experienced more transfers than new registration of voters. Once the data is processed, we shall know the trends and what they mean for preparation of elections, such as the size of polling stations," Chebukati said.The IEBC will now process all the data received from the field to the Central Database at the Headquarters in Nairobi for further processing."This will entail matching of all the records received to ensure that there are no duplicates or persons appearing in the register more than once," Chebukati told a press briefing.A preliminary register will be compiled after about 40 days and sent to field registration officers to confirm accuracy of the information."Once we receive feedback from field officers, the commission shall prepare the draft register that will be subjected to inspection and verification by the public starting May 10, 2017. The commission shall then amend, certify and then publish the final register of voters as per the law in readiness for the elections," Chebukati said.The IEBC will start registering about 19,000 prisoners today, as about 30,000 inmates of prisons and remands do not have ID cards.According to the department of Correctional Services, there are 49,867 prisoners in 118 facilities countrywide."Those to be registered will be adult citizens who will present themselves with national IDs, must be of sound mind and must not have been convicted of an electoral offence in preceding five years to the elections," Chebukati said.Chebukati also announced IEBC has started receiving nomination rules and urged parties to adhere to the timelines in respect to next week's deadline.Political parties have until March 8 to register members and submit the lists within 10 days to the commission in preparation for nominations.Party membership lists are a in elections as parties use them at nomination, while IEBC uses them to confirm those seeking nomination are members.Parties also have until March 2 to ensure they have submitted their nomination rules ahead of primaries slated from April 13 to April 26."The parties will then have 14 days between April 13 and 26 to conduct their primaries after which the dispute resolution by political parties dispute tribunal will be conducted in 30 days between April 20 and May 19," Chebukati said.He called on Kenyans to reflect on what type of elections they want, saying IEBC wants to deliver free, fair and peaceful elections."As we enter the next phase of preparations, nomination of candidates, we urge parties and aspirants to conduct their business within the rule of law and ensure their processes are peaceful and credible. We shall not hesitate to take action against those violating the electoral code of conduct," Chebukati said.At the same time, the IEBC is to award the tender for election technology in a week to allow setting up the system for voter verification slated for April.Chebukati said the procurement process was ongoing and on schedule and the system will be up and running by May 28.
