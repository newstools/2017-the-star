Cabinet Secretary Sicily Kariuki has denied rumours she is planning to run for a political seat in Embu.&ldquo;May I clear the air that I&rsquo;m not interested in vying for any political seat in the county. I am satisfied with the position the President has given me at the moment,&rdquo; she said on Friday.Kariuki told politicians not to fear her. The Public Service, Youth and Gender boss said her regular presence in the county is not meant to gain political mileage but mobilise residents to register as voters. Kariuki said she is satisfied with the position President Uhuru Kenyatta gave her and she is reciprocating by serving the country diligently and with loyalty.She has visited the county regularly since voter registration started and has met politicians, administrators and county officials to strategise on ending residents&rsquo; apathy towards registering as voters.Kariuki urged residents to register in large numbers to vote so they can decide their future. She expressed concern that after two weeks, only 34,836 residents have registered as new voters, against a target of 256,000.She was speaking to Embu cooperative society leaders in Emco Hall in Embu town and later to residents at the Kiritiri shopping centre, where she distributed relief food.
