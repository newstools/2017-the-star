Vihiga County Government have said they will continue to sponsor the Vihiga United FC in the SportPesa Premier League.Vihiga United were on Thursday promoted to the top tier league alongside KCB after they went through the Football Kenya Federation club licensing requirements for Kenya Premier League clubs.Speaking at Kidundu team&rsquo;s training grounds, Vihiga County Government County Executive Commitee Member for Finance Moses Luvisi said the county will continue with their sponsorship of the team.Luvisi said: &ldquo;We have sponsored this team since 2014 and it has never let us down. We started in the lower tier then the National Super League and now look.....here we are.&ldquo;I have come here today to deliver a congratulatory message from Governor Moses Akaranga, he is not in the County at the moment but he told me to share his excitement with you,&rdquo; added the beaming CEC.Luvisi did not disclose the nature of the sponsorship.Head coach Edward Manoah said the promotion was not expected at all after the team finished sixth in the league.However, he said: &ldquo;Our strict abidance to the rules has paid off, when FKF set up licensing requirement we followed the rules and we complied and these are the results.&rdquo;He dismissed criticism that he had prepared his team for NSL not SPL, saying: &ldquo;Every team&rsquo;s objective is to play in the top flight league, that is why we are ever ready&rdquo;The former AFC Leopard&rsquo;s coach said although he lost many players including his captain in the last transfer window, but his philosophy has been to tap talent.&rdquo;&ldquo;If you look around here you may not see big names but soon big names will emerge from these boys,&rdquo; said Manoah.He said &ldquo;Martin Imbalambala has shown tremendous improvement since he joined the team in December. We want to reactivate him and I am sure he will be very useful to the team.&rdquo; He said he doesn&rsquo;t want to be over ambitious by putting so much pressure on the boys but he wants to remain in the league.Manoah said last year his team got three call ups to the National league and this year he expects more.Soccer lovers across the county have celebrated the promotion but they have urged the county government to build a stadium.Vihiga United play all their matches away in Mumias.
