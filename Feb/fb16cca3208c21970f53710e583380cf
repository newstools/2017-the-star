This is to express my regret at the failure of Kenya to secure the Chairmanship of the AU Commission. The Jubilee government squandered a great opportunity.It is disappointing that after so much energy, national resources and hope expended in pursuit of the AU presidency, Kenya should emerge crestfallen following the loss of our candidate for AU Commission Chair, Amb. Amina Mohamed.It isn&rsquo;t for lack of qualifications; experience and exposure that Amina failed to clinch the position. The blame can only be shouldered by the botched misadventure of the promoters of our candidates &ndash; the Jubilee government ineptitude. Regional and international diplomacy isn&rsquo;t your usual cup of domestic posturing; it requires seasoned, erudite planning and engineering to which it is apparent, the Jubilee regime wasn&rsquo;t prepared for.It is a well-known traditional consensus within the AU Diplomacy that the AU Commission Chair is a rotational post between regions and among Anglophone and Francophone AU states. To have fielded an Anglophone candidate to succeed an immediate Anglophone without sufficiently lobbying the evident Francophone beneficiaries wasn&rsquo;t a diplomatically astute thing to do. That disadvantage alone should have forewarned Kenya against fielding a candidate.The AU must have also been forewarned that the candidature of Amina wasn&rsquo;t in the best interests of the AU, but a misplaced lone ego trip by Kenya&rsquo;s rulers to use the position for self-aggrandizement. It must have occurred to AU members to be cautious of Kenya&rsquo;s seemingly descent into isolationism especially as relates to international diplomacy. Apparently Jubilee couldn&rsquo;t convince peers that it can be entrusted with the responsibility of the AU chair without it convulsing it for narrow regime pursuits.Hon Musalia Mudavadi
