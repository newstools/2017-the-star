Turkish clothing retailer LC Waikiki is looking to tap into the Sub-Saharan market through its first store at the Two Rivers Mall in Nairobi. The fashion specialist, which injected $1.5 million (Sh155.49 million) into the 2,000 square metre outlet, has 750 stores in 35 countries and targets to open 1,500 more by the end of 2023. &ldquo;We decided to start in Kenya because the Kenyan economy is mostly stable, the gross domestic product growth is not so high, but it is stable. Kenya is a retail-oriented country and there is a fast growing middle class which is very good,&rdquo; LC Waikiki country manager Kremena Pencheva said. &ldquo;Actually we are late. We were supposed to come to the country a year ago. Back then we had a problem getting a proper location, but now we are here at the Two Rivers Mall.&rdquo; The retailer plans to open another outlet at the Hub Karen in the next four months, and later expand to Nairobi, Mombasa and Kisumu. &ldquo;Probably very soon we will have a few more stores in the city, but if sales are good we will explore other cities in the country and hopefully reach 140 million consumers in East Africa,&rdquo; Pencheva said. The retailer minted $2.9 billion (Sh300.61 billion) from sales globally as of December 2016.
