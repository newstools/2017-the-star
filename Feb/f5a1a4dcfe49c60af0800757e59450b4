The High Court has temporarily stopped the NGO Coordination Board from deregistering the Evans Kidero Foundation.Justice George Odunga issued the orders on Friday, pending determination of the Foundation's suit.The Board last Tuesday deregistered the charitable organisation, citing financial irregularities.&ldquo;Your organisation has breached the provisions of regulation 24, read together with clause 5 of the terms and conditions attached to your registration certificate, by failing to file annual returns," Board CEO Mohamed Fazul said in a letter.But the foundation, through lawyer Willis Otieno, argued that the deregistration is unprocedural.Odunga ordered the parties to appear in court on March 13 for further directions on the hearing of the case.
