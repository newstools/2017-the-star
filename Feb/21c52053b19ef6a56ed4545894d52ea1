One of Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho&rsquo;s foot soldiers has admitted that the county chief influenced the failed attempt to sack speaker Thadius Rajwayi.In May last year, MCAs came to blows in the assembly when Rajwayi refused to step down. Rajwayi sought court orders stopping the discussion of the motion to sack him.Proponents of the motion cited abuse of office and corruption.Patrick Simuyu (Tudor) tabled the motion and read a petition signed by 15 MCAs demanding a change of guard.On Thursday, Junda MCA Paul Onje said Rajwayi is being frustrated because he refused to toe Joho&rsquo;s line. &ldquo;Rajwayi was appointed by Joho. What led to the sack bid was his disobedience to his boss. If you are given any job and you fail to obey then there is disruption.&rdquo;
