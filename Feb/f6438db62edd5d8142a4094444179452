Hundreds of residents yesterday thronged voter registration centres as the listing drive ends today.Kirinyaga Central IEBC coordinator Teresia Mithamo said by Sunday, the turnout was still low, but yesterday, there were long queues.Mithamo said by close of business on Sunday the county had registered 45,000 new voters. The figure is expected to increase by a small margin today.Mithamo said the electoral agency targeted 131,000 registrations in the month-long drive. She said thousands of eligible voters who have not listed will not be able to vote in the August 8 general election.She attributed the low turnout to illiteracy, saying many people don&rsquo;t understand the importance of their vote and wait to be given handouts by politicians as motivation.&ldquo;We have so far registered 45 per cent of our target though we had wished to enlist at least 80 per cent. Kenyans have a tendency to wait until the last minute before they turn out for anything. It is a bad habit,&rdquo; Mithamo said at her office in Kerugoya.The official blamed civic organisations for not conducting education on the importance of voting, saying it should be a continuous exercise. The drive comes to a close as many people turned out at the registration of persons at the county headquarters to apply for IDs in Kerugoya as early as 8am.By press time, the queue was still long.
