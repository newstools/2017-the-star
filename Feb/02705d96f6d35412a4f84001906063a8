Kenyans at the disputed Migingo Island have complained of being forced to pay exorbitant taxes and levies by Ugandan security officers. Residents said they are being forced to pay a one-off Sh70,000 to get registration numbers for their vessels and an additional Sh4,000 weekly taxes. This comes barely a week after the Ugandan government changed all security officers at the disputed island, following residents' complaints of harassment and corruption. “We have been instructed to pay up the amount to Ugandans as it is required by law in their country to register all boats, which we don’t have in Kenya,” fisherman Jackson Odhiambo told the Star on the phone yesterday. Kenyan officials at the island, who spoke in condition of anonymity, said the charges will be used to harass fishermen. In 2014 the Uganda government started charging boats and fishermen operating on its waters after more than 200,000 fishermen in Uganda were involved in illegal fishing activities. The illegal fishing cost $60 million (Sh6 billion), according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. In 2003 the East Africa Community, through the Lake Victoria Transport Bill, made a creation of commission to regulate maritime safety by provision for the construction, survey, registration and licensing of all vessels on the lake. Kenya is yet to implement the directive. But speaking to the Star in his office, Migori county commander David Kirui termed the claims of harassment as propaganda by parties interested in the island to seek attention. “So far the island is peaceful. Sadly, during numerous joint meetings between Kenyan and Ugandan officials at the island, these issues never come up. We only read of them in the press,” he said.
