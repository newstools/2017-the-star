A crisis is looming between Kenya Sevens and the Kenya Rugby Union over the delayed signing of new contracts for the 2016/17 season.The union wants the players&rsquo; contracts to expire at the end of the World Sevens Series in May while the players want the contracts to end in July.Talks between the union and the players have stalled in the past one month. The players were expected to sign the contracts upon their return to the country from Sydney early this month but they have since declined.Speaking before departure to Las Vegas on Saturday, Kenya Sevens skipper Andrew Amonde believes they are being victimised for their actions in November when thy went on strike demanding bonuses from last season&rsquo;s campaign totaling to Sh22million.&ldquo;I think they want to punish us for asking for our bonuses last year. That&rsquo;s why they want us to sign contracts which will expire in May. We are still talking and hopefully we can agree and put this behind us as soon as possible,&rdquo; said Amonde.The union had in November committed to pay the players Sh8million in bonuses. The layers have so far received Sh4million with the rest of the amount expected to be cleared at the end of May.However, Kenya Rugby Union vice chairman Thomas Opiyo downplayed the tussle between the players and the union.&ldquo;As far as I am concerned, we are still talking and the players are receiving their salaries. Remember, last year the contracts were signed in May. We gave (the players) nothing to worry about. It&rsquo;s only one contentious point, the length of the contract,&rdquo; said Opiyo.Opiyo did not give a timeline on when the players&rsquo; contracts will be signed.&ldquo;I cannot give you an exact date when the contracts will be signed since we are still negotiating we we hope to sign them as soon as possible,&rdquo; he said.Elsewhere, Homeboyz moved to third place in the Kenya Cup standings with a 32-16 win over Blak Blad at Kenyatta University over the weekend. Kenya Sevens international Cyprian Kuto scored twice as Alvine Otieno, Nelson Sangura and Jeff Olouch added a try each for the Deejays with Kelvin Masai contributing a conversion.
