The government has doubled up relief food rations to feed three million people, up from an initial 1.3 million Kenyans under the feeding programme, State House spokesperson Manoah Esipisu has said. He said the government has also enhanced water trucking across the country, especially in the 23 arid and semi-arid counties that have adversely been affected by drought.&ldquo;We are tackling the drought with all efforts available to us, especially under the authority of the National Disaster Response that the President has committed to in terms of how we address the situation,&rdquo; Esipisu said.He made the remarks at the Kakamega State Lodge yesterday, where he held his weekly press briefing.Esipisu said the livestock offtake has also been enhanced in all 23 ASAL counties. &ldquo;We are buying cows, goats and sheep. Since most of them are not in good condition, the government is slaughtering them and distributing the meat to residents to eat and store in traditional ways as dried up meat. We are also supplying this meat to schools in those areas,&rdquo; he said. Esipisu said development partners such as Red Cross and UN agencies have continued to support the government in targeting specific vulnerable groups, like the elderly, women and children under the age of 5. &ldquo;These are being provided with fortified foods. Lactating mothers are also getting fortified foods, including vitamins and energy supplements,&rdquo; he said. On security, Esipisu said the Inspector General of Police&rsquo;s reports indicate that there have been no incidents in Baringo in the last two days. He said security has been beefed up significantly in the area and the insecurity situation in the area has being contained.&ldquo;Our security agents remain vigilant to deal with whatever situation that may arise,&rdquo; he said.
