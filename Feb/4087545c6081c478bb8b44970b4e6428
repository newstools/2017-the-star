Wiper national chairman David Musila &mdash; who refuses to drop his governor bid &mdash; has been accused by Kitui MCAs of disloyalty, disrespect and malice towards party leader Kalonzo Musyoka.On Thursday, 23 Wiper MCAs said Musila&rsquo;s refusal and his criticism of Kalonzo were calculated to undermine Kalonzo&rsquo;s authority and the respect and confidence Kenyans accord him.They were reacting to Musila&rsquo;s remarks after Kalonzo urged him to drop his bid for Kitui governor and seek reelection to the Senate.Kalonzo has said Kitui Governor Julius Malombe should be reelected in the August 8 polls. The Wiper leader spoke last week in Kwa Vonza in the presence of Musila and Malombe. But a day later, Musila called a press conference in Kitui town to oppose Kalonzo&rsquo;s request. He said no one except God, would stop him from going for the top seat. He told Kalonzo to concentrate on the presidency.Ngomeni MCA Nzungi Ngwele read the MCAs&rsquo; statement at the office of Kitui assembly majority leader Jacob Maundu.&ldquo;We wish to express our disgust at the manner in which Senator Musila reacted to the advice of party leader to stick to his Senate position in order to avoid causing a harmful rift in the party,&rdquo; Ngwele said. The MCAs said Musila and Kitui East MP Marcus Muluvi levelled &ldquo;careless, baseless, wild and unwarranted attacks&rdquo; against the party leader.They said Kalonzo should be obeyed as he carries the burden of uniting the party in Kitui. &ldquo;It is within his mandate and responsibilities to give advice on the Kitui governor race,&rdquo; Ngwele said.Later on Thursday Musila said, &ldquo;I spoke to Kalonzo and we have put the matter to rest.&rdquo; He said he would not respond to MCAs&rsquo; &ldquo;cheap and childish lies ... I have seen their statement and nothing serious has been raised.&rdquo; He said issues raised by the authors of the statement had been addressed.
