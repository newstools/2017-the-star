Three hundred and twenty striking doctors are to be fired and only about half of them will be replaced.The city says it has far too many doctors than it needs.The nationwide doctors&rsquo; strike entered its 58th day today .County secretary Robert Ayisi yesterday told the Star the executive committee meeting decided last week on the firing and hiring.Health executive Bernard Muia was instructed to list the numbers of doctors and specialists required.The County Public Service Board will advertise the vacancies.&ldquo;We are going the Council of Governors way. Since they [doctors] have not come on duty for more than 50 days, we shall terminate their services. We have already come up with a formula of hiring new doctors,&rdquo; Ayisi said.The medics have been on the streets since December 5, demanding implementation of a CBA signed in 2013.Ayisi said the county has too many doctors, 320 are more than it needs. and it will only hire about half, 160.&ldquo;In Nairobi, we have about 320 doctors. To us, that&rsquo;s a very high number. A facility like Mbagathi has 42 medical doctors, Mama Lucy has 38 and Pumwani has 30,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;The county is spending a lot of money for this big number, yet most are not actually working. They are doing their own [private] businesses. We shall hire new doctors on our terms and renewable contracts,&rdquo; he said.The county has several times threatened to sack the medics. Two weeks ago, City Hall issued show-cause letters to the doctors and gave them a week to respond or be sacked.The county secretary also said that henceforth, all graduate doctors seeking internship will apply directly to the county. When their term expires, they will look for jobs elsewhere, he saidAyisi said the county has been patient and given doctors enough time to negotiate and end their strike.
