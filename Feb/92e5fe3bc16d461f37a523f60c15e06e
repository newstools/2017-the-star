The inaugural Lake Region Health Investment Conference 2017 scheduled for 29th-31st March, 2017 at Kisii University might be postponed if the on-going doctors' strike continues.Kisii Deputy Governor Joash Maangi said, "Holding the conference when the doctors are on strike will be unrealistic. We might consider postponing the conference until doctors resume duty."He spoke during the pre-conference meeting in Nairobi.Maangi said they expect doctors to be back at work by next week.However, some participants objected to the proposal saying pushing the conference to April or May is untenable as the country is headed for elections in August.The 'Strengthening Healthcare Systems through Partnerships for Social Economic Prosperity conference will help member counties leverage on their strength and address inherent challenges.Participants at the pre-conference questioned why doctors were paid salaries for working for only two hours and spending six hours in their private business.Instead of having doctors on the payroll, specialists should be contracted to reduce the wage bill, some participants said.
