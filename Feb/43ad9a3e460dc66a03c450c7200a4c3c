The National Lands Commission has began vetting and approving names of landowners whose parcels have been acquired for the establishment of the Sh200 billion coal power plant in Lamu.The list has 615 individuals and all genuine owners will be compensated.The coal project is under the Amu Power Company and is to be set up at Kwasasi in Hindi. The plant is expected to generate at least 1,050 MW of power once complete.NLC chairman Muhammad Swazuri said the vetting will sieve out fake land owners.He said investigations have established that 17 of the names were of individuals who either do not exist or had no land at the coal plant site. Vetting is ongoing.&ldquo;We have printed all the 615 names of people who say they own land at the project site and want compensation. However, as is the norm, we will subject each name to thorough scrutiny and vetting so that we only compensate valid land owners. We know there are so many ghost land owners and the vetting will help us deal with that,&rdquo; Swazuri said.He spoke on Friday shortly after unveiling the list of the 615 at the Lamu county lands offices in Mokowe.The NLC chairman said the vetting will be conducted in the next three days after which the approved list of names will be handed over to a special committee that will oversee the compensation.The committee will comprise members from the NLC, Kenya Ports Authority, Energy ministry and the county government.Swazuri said affected land owners will be paid not less than Sh800,000 an acre for land at the coal plant site.Lamu Governor Issa Timamy, however, expressed his dissatisfaction over the Sh800,000 per acre compensation. He said a number of landowners have complained that the amount is too little.&ldquo;I hope the commission will listen and reason out with them so that at the end of it all everybody is happy and the disgruntled voices taken care of,&rdquo; Timamy said.A total of 975 acres have been acquired for the establishment of the plant.
