National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi yesterday told lashed at the international community for lecturing Africa on refugee matters, instead of resolving the refugee crisis.He accused Europe of applying double standards on the refugee problem. Muturi was responding to a group of MPs under the Parliamentary Network on the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, which met in Parliament Buildings. He defended the decision to close down the Dadaab refugee camp, saying it was informed by many factors, including collaborative intelligence reports that pointed to planning of terror attacks by people living in the camps.&ldquo;What&rsquo;s good for the goose must be good for the gander,&rdquo; Muturi said.European countries have been accused of denying asylum to refugees, especially people fleeing conflict in Syria.&ldquo;European countries don&rsquo;t seem to be worried with what&rsquo;s happening in Europe or North America. You can see this through handling of immigrants from the seven Muslim-majority nations under the new US administration led by President Donald Trump,&rdquo; he said.Muturi said Kenya has had its fair share of challenges on dealing with terror attacks, adding that unless Somalia is stabilised, the situation is unlikely to change. On February 9, the High Court in Nairobi quashed the government&rsquo;s plan to close down the Dadaab camp. Justice John Mativo ruled that the directive issued last year by Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery and PS Karanja Kibicho to close down the complex was unconstitutional.
