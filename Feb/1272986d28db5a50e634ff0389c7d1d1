The Kisii county assembly&rsquo;s passage of the Retirement Benefits Bill is a scandal (see report P38). The MCAs want Governor James Ongwae given a sendoff package that comprises a Sh10 million golden handshake and Sh500,000 per month for life.If he assents to the Bill, Ongwae will also get a four-vehicle renewable every four years and a fully equipped office and staff.The Kisii County Retirements Benefits Bill also sets out benefits for deputy governors, MCAs and former councillors.Former deputy governors and speakers will receive Sh300,000 each per month.The deputy governor and speaker will each get Sh8 million, while MCAs, former mayors and council chairmen get Sh5 million.This is preposterous. What is the point of pursuing former councilors deep in their retirement and giving them taxpayer cash for the balance of their lives?The Kisii MCAs have taken the cue from Parliament. But two wrongs don&rsquo;t make a right. They are doing this just because they can.
