A man yesterday was nearly lynched after he was caught with a form two girl at Farmers&rsquo; Inn in Chwele town.The girl said she was on her way home from school for mid-term and had passed by the inn to see her sister, who works there.She found, however, that her sister had travelled to Nairobi. The elder sister told her sibling to put up at the inn until she returned on Wednesday.Wilson Wabanda, 24, said the girl is her sister-in-law. &lsquo;&rsquo;I&rsquo;m the husband of her sister who works here. She had told me to take care of her sister as she has gone to Nairobi,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said. Wabanda said that the girl lost her mother last month and has nowhere to go but to stay with her sister. But residents accused him of being a university student preying on young girls.
