Raila Odinga has perfected the art of scapegoating with his interference in the jailing of doctors, Aden Duale has said.Raila, who is Opposition leader, said the month-long sentencing was "horrifying and disturbing" and that his lawyers would appeal judge Hellen Wasilwa's ruling.Wasilwa effected the sentence on Monday after doctors refused to end their strike that began on December 5 last year and has left at least 20 people dead.[VIDEO] Doctors' union officials jailed one month for contempt of courtRead: Raila asks his lawyers to appeal 'disturbing' ruling that jailed doctorsBut in a statement on Monday, Duale said Raila was "at it again" and was playing politics with the doctors&rsquo; strike."Lamenting and blame games... Everyone, including all institutions of government, must comply with court orders," said the National Assembly Majority leader and Garissa Town MP.Duale said refusal to comply with a court order was nothing but "impunity" and an affront to the rule of law and the constitution."The leaders of the doctors union have not been jailed by the Executive and have not been jailed for pursuing their rights. They have been jailed for disobeying the court," he said.The Majority leader added that Raila chose to stand with KMPDU bosses who defied a court ruling, not the millions of Kenyans who are suffering."The illegal CBA was created when Raila served as Prime Minister. The health docket was led by his close ally, supporter and appointee Anyang&rsquo; Nyong&rsquo;o," he said.Doctors and the government signed a Collective Bargaining Agreement in 2013 but it was declared illegal since it was not registered before the Industrial and Labour Court.They took it to court for registration last year, but justice Monica Mbaru ruled that their union had to negotiate a new one with the Health ministry, Salaries and Remuneration Commission and the counties.Duale said the Opposition leader should concentrate on the extortion and corruption surrounding him, his family and close allies."Raila may require the services of the lawyers he is proposing for the doctors&rsquo; strike," he said.Read: Siaya leaders defend Raila against 'conman' Dominion CEO over bribery claimsAlso read: Come clean on Dominion Farms extortion saga, Jubilee tells RailaBut in a quick counter, Cord secretariat boss Norman Magaya lashed out at Duale saying Jubilee cannot stand the test of leadership.Magaya said the Jubilee government should disband the Health ministry and transfer all funds to counties for them to take over."The time has come for Jubilee to own up or ship out. If President Uhuru Kenyatta and Jubilee have surrendered their responsibility they must immediately let Kenyans know," he said.Magaya further said in his statement that blaming Raila and the grand coalition government will not end the crisis."We are in this crisis because Jubilee is holding onto billions of shillings meant for county governments to manage the health sector," he said."If indeed Jubilee believes this is a county crisis, those monies must immediately be released to governors to help them manage the crisis."Doctors are demanding the fulfillment of the CBA that includes a 300 per cent pay rise and better working conditions.They have also accused the government of failing to stock public hospitals with basic medicines and supplies of items such as gloves.Read: Oluga explains 'unfortunate' 65-day doctors' strike to Senate[VIDEO] Court suspends doctors' jail sentence, gives 5 days to call off strikeStriking doctors in Mombasa earlier said they will escalate the strike and ask those in the private sector to join them.KMPDU Coast branch secretary general Abi Mwachi added that a team had already been identified to rally the public to support their course.More on this: You have put spark on petrol, striking doctors tell state after officials jailed
