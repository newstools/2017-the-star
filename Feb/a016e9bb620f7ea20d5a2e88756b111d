The government has assured participating countries that the forthcoming IAAF World Under-18 Championships is right on course.Speaking yesterday after an inter-governmental coordination meeting between the ministries of Internal security, Sports and Foreign Affairs at Harambee House, Government spokesman, Eric Kiraithe, said the event is very much on course and will go on as planned.He down played the withdrawal of five countries including New Zealand, Australia, Canada, United Kingdom and the United States from the four-day championship slated for July 12-16 at Moi, Kasarani Stadium. He said the four Commonwealth countries have opted to send their team to the Commonwealth Youth Games set for Bahamas a week after the world under-18 show in Nairobi while the United States has had a shift in its foreign policy.&ldquo;Look at what is happening in the United States. They have a new president, who has a new agenda and may not see the need to send young kids to Africa. The others are skipping the event to focus on the Commonwealth Youth Games,&rdquo; added Kiraithe. He said some countries had pulled out because they can&rsquo;t keep pace with Kenya&rsquo;s prowess on the track. &ldquo;A country like Netherlands has never won any medal in such events and so they decided to skip the event,&rdquo; he added.Kiraithe said the IAAF have over 200 members and with only six countries withdrawing, it doesn&rsquo;t dilute the championship.He said they will engage with the remaining countries and assure them of high level security and preparations the country has put in place.&ldquo; We will liaise with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Parliamentary Committee of Welfare and Labour on the event and engage in shuttle diplomacy with other government departments and agencies to ensure as many countries as possible attend the championship,&rdquo; he added.Local Organising Commitee (LOC) chief executive officer, Mwangi Muthee, said all contractors are on site and have started work on athletes hostel at Kenyatta University and the Kasarani Stadium.Muthee, who led a high powered team from Kenya to the IAAF headquarters in Monaco last week, said Mondo will lay a new tartan track at Kasarani from next week.He said he expects top delegation from the world governing body in March to assess the preparation ahead of the event. He added that they will have dry runs for event in either May or June to gauge their prepardeness for the championship.
