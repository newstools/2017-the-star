First Lady Margaret Kenyatta has said no nation can hope to achieve peace, stability and social cohesion without educating all its children. She said a nation that prioritises the education of its people averts many social problems and unlocks limitless opportunities.&ldquo;No nation, which allows its children to wilt in the shadow of neglect, can ever hope to achieve social cohesion, peace, stability, economic prosperity, or any of the other goals we all aspire to in our society,&rdquo; she said.The First Lady spoke during the sixthth edition of the annual Murang&rsquo;a County Initiative (MCI-2017) Scholarships and Excellence Awards ceremony in Ihuura Stadium, where she was the chief guest.A total of 33 students received full scholarships, while the best-performing and improved public primary schools from the eight subcounties received trophies and cash prizes of Sh100,000 each.Several best-performing teachers in their respective subjects were also recognised and rewarded. Margaret said investing in the education of children is investing in the future of the nation. She called for a holistic approach to education to ensure effective emotional and cognitive development of children.
