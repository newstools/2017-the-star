Britain has been warned to brace itself for 'treacherous' travel disruption and power cuts as Storm Doris sweeps in bringing 80mph gusts and heavy snow.Doris is likely to cause travel disruption, damage buildings and send debris flying when it hits on Thursday morning, the Met Office has warned. The worst storm of the winter will batter the country today and is set to be even more severe than initially feared, with weather warnings extended across almost all of England and Wales.Storm Doris &ndash; the first named storm of 2017 &ndash;is expected to cause widespread damage to buildings, interruption to power supplies and extensive travel problems. Particularly at risk are high-sided vehicles, caravans and motorbikes and drivers are 'strongly advised' to avoid travelling on some stretches of road in Yorkshire, the Midlands, and the East and North West. AA spokesman John Snowling said: 'The unpleasant combination of torrential rain, severe gales and heavy snow will create some very poor driving conditions, with the potential for roads to be affected by black ice, debris or standing water.'Wind can also bring down tree branches, blow you off course or blow other vehicles into your path.'Expect travel disruption as some roads will be treacherous.' Richard Leonard, head of road safety at Highways England, added: 'We're expecting Storm Doris to have a significant impact on the roads throughout the day so are urging drivers to consider changing their plans if necessary and to slow down in stormy weather.'Drivers should look out for warnings on the electronic message signs and listen for updates in radio travel bulletins.' An amber 'be prepared' warning is in place for an area stretching from North Wales across the North West, Yorkshire, the Midlands and into the northern edges of the home counties.Drivers are issued an Amber Warning Snow Forecast sign on M8Meanwhile a yellow 'be aware' warning of winds up to 60mph covers the area immediately to the south, including London and Brighton. Although the violent gusts will be accompanied by rain in most places, up to 30cm of snow could fall on high ground in Northern England and Scotland.Widespread snowfall of 10-15cm is also predicted on lower areas in Northern England, with Cumbria, North Yorkshire and Northumberland set to experience treacherous, blizzard-like conditions.The severe weather is set to last from 6am to 8pm today, and the Met Office is warning of injury from flying debris such as tree branches and roof tiles.Anyone affected by power cuts during the storm is encouraged to dial 105 for further information. Grahame Madge, from the Met Office, said: 'Storm Doris is bringing a severe level of disruption to most of the UK.'We expect to see disruption to the transport network including felled trees and some restrictions on bridges and disruption to ferries.'Structural damage and disruption to power supplies is also expected, and people will have to watch out for felled trees.'He added: 'There will be strong winds during both rush hours and we would advise commuters plan ahead and give themselves longer for journeys.'The most intense period will be in the middle of the day, and the weather will have calmed down a bit by tomorrow evening.'Friday will be a much more benign day, with calmer conditions expected, but another belt of rain will make it's way in on Saturday.'
