The South Sudan government has traced missing $10 million (Sh1.03 billion) to Kenyan bank accounts linked to former SPLA Deputy Chief of Staff General Thomas Cirillo Swaka, a letter says.The money was recovered in Ecobank, Kenya Commercial Bank and Cooperative Bank of Kenya accounts, allegedly belonging to Swaka and his sister Fueni Cirillo.South Sudan leaders have stashed vast amounts in Kenyan banks and invested in property and other ventures. Fueni is reportedly studying Human Resource Management at Mt Kenya University. But MKU said it is not aware of a student by that name.The bank statement seen by the Star showed the transaction of the missing money from the South Sudan government to the Kenyan banks.Ambassador Renish Omullo, a Special Envoy in charge of German International and Regional Affairs, said the money is already blocked and being sent back to South Sudan.She said the loss of the money was successive theft, as Swaka was in charge of logistics.Omullo, a Kenyan, said immediately Swaka defected, his personal assistant Johnson Achok Gadet wired $3.3 million (Sh341.8 million) to his sister&rsquo;s account at Ecobank.Ecobank said in a statement, &ldquo;We do not have such an account at Ecobank, neither do we have an official request on the same.&rdquo;According to Gen Paul Malong Awan, the Chief of General Staff of Sudan People&rsquo;s Liberation Army, the money disappeared after Swaka quit his job this month.A letter to Omullo from General Awan dated February 9, shows that Swaka had defected. &ldquo;Consequence to that, large sum of money in USD in his custody has also disappeared. The Office of the President through the office of the SPLA&rsquo;s Chief of General Staff is hereby tasking you Dr Renish to trace and facilitate the return of the money in question using all the available means,&rdquo; it says.Another letter to Foreign Affairs CS Amina Mohammed says General Swaka is a former SPLA officer and fugitive in Kenya, who stole more than $10 million alongside his sister.In a February 10 letter, Omullo requested the closure of bank accounts and recovery of money held by Swaka and Fueni in Kenyan Banaks.In the letter, Omullo says the communication did not go through the Nairobi embassy because of its sensitivity and conflict of interest at the embassy, necessitating this initiative by the South Sudan President through the ambassador&rsquo;s office.In his resignation, Gen Swaka accused President Salva Kiir and SPLA leadership of abuses and a tribal agenda. He becomes the second highest-ranking officer to resign after Gen Bapiny Monytuil, since clashes erupted between government soldiers and opposition fighters in July last year.
