The Kenya National Union of Teachers has started recruiting Early Childhood Development Education teachers into the union as they await finalisation of schemes of service.Speaking to the Star, Knut secretary general Wilson Sossion (pictured) said the schemes will streamline the sector. He said there is need to come up with a standard procedure on hiring the teachers.Last year, Knut asked the Teachers Service Commission to gazette the schemes and immediately roll out a recruitment drive. Under the schemes, TSC was expected to recruit the teachers, who were to be posted to public schools with the lowest grade teacher earning Sh20,000.The schemes of service establish nine grades for ECDE teachers and seven for assistant ECDE teachers. Under the nine levels, the chief principal ECDE teacher was placed in job group R.A senior principal ECDE teacher I and II were placed under job groups Q and P, respectively. The senior ECDE teacher will be in job group M. ECDE teachers I, II, III and IV were placed in job groups L, K, J and H.Assistant ECDE teachers and senior assistant ECDE teacher I were placed in job group L and assistant ECDE teachers I, II, III and IV in job groups H, G, F and E.Sossion said Knut is crafting a memorandum for the teachers to be absorbed into the union to safeguard their interests. Kisumu county has already signed the memo for its ECDE staff to join Knut.
