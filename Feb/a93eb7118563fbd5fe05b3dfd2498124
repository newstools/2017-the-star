ODM has suffered a major blow in Kilifi county after some politicians ditched the party for Jubilee.The defectors, led by Deputy Governor Kenneth Kamto, were received by Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya in Dr Krapf Grounds, Rabai, on Saturday.Kilifi North MP and Jubilee lieutenant in the Coast Gideon Mung&rsquo;aro and the party's national chairman Nelson Dzuya were also present to receive the defectors.Kamto was unveiled as Mung&rsquo;aro&rsquo;s running mate to unseat Governor Amason Kingi.Deputy President William Ruto was in the county last Wednesday to receive more defectors.Kamto, one of Kingi's most aggressive foot soldiers in 2013, cited frustration by Kingi&rsquo;s administration.He marshalled votes for Kingi in his Rabai home turf. About 65 per cent of the governor&rsquo;s votes came from Rabai and Kaloleni.Those who defected with Kamto include Rabai Kisurutini MCA Anthony Mupe, who is now eyeing the Rabai MP seat occupied by William Kamoti.Mupe&rsquo;s entrance into the race on the Jubilee ticket dislodged Mombasa Nominated Senator Emma Mbura, who had declared her interest on the same ticket.She has moved to the Maendeleo Chap Chap party.Senate aspirant Ken Nyale also decamped to Jubilee. He is a threat to incumbent Stewart Madzayo.Nyale received massive support from ODM&rsquo;s iron lady and Kilifi woman representative Asha Jumwa after Madzayo endorsed Malindi MP Willy Mtengo to be ODM flag bearer for the seat in August. Aisha is also eyeing the same seat.Nyale is a household name in Kilifi South subcounty where he comes from and Magarin, Kingi's home.Others who defected include ODM&rsquo;s national executive council member Grace Mboja.Kamto is the second ODM deputy governor in the region to join Jubilee after Mombasa Deputy Governor Hazel Katana.Kamto has been the ODM Kilifi branch chairman until last year when he refused to contest his seat.He fell out with his boss after news went round that he was warming up to unseat him.Their relationship went from bad to worse after Kingi failed to intervene when the deputy governor was embroiled in a dispute with the then Kilifi county secretary Owen Baya who is the ODM&rsquo;s chief strategist and is now vying for the Kilifi north parliamentary seat.
