The majority of Kenyans believe the 2016 KCSE exam was marked correctly, according to an Ipsos survey.The survey, conducted between January 9 and 26, indicates 77 per cent of respondents are &ldquo;very confident&rdquo; the marking was correct, despite questions pointing to a hurried process that led to release of the results on December 29.A total 88,929 candidates scored at least C-plus grade, the minimum university entry requirement. In the 2015 exam, 169,492 candidates scored similar grades. The poll also found 78 per cent of Kenyans agree the results were worse, compared to the 2015 KCSE exam results. Of this, 90 per cent were Nairobi residents, Nyanza at 89, Central 83, North Eastern 80, Rift Valley 79 and Western and Eastern at 74. Only 51 per cent of respondents from the Coast region believe the results were worse.A total of 2,057 respondents were interviewed.

In households without a teacher or a relative as a teacher, 76 per cent had confidence in the marking.
