Embu speaker Justus Mate has said he will not defend his seat if Governor Martin Wambora is reelected.The two have had a shaky relationship since 2013. Mate twice led MCAs in tabling two impeachment motions against the governor, on February 14 and May 13, 2015. The motions were overruled by the Court of Appeal.&ldquo;There must be respect between the two offices so that the speaker and the governor can effectively share ideas and agree on key policy decisions,&rdquo; Mate said.Mate said, however, he will work with Wambora until the end of their terms. &ldquo;We will work to ensure Embu County meets its budgetary obligations as we head into the August 8 polls,&rdquo; he said.
