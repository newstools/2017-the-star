Emily Muteti set two national records in 200 and 400m individual medley at the Coast Amateur Swimming Association (CASA) gala over the weekend at the Aga Khan School.Muteti clocked 2:25.94 minutes in the 200m individual medley, erasing her previous mark of 2:27.94 and went ahead to set a new record of 5:05.90 in the 400m individual medley, breaking the previous mark of 5:10.90 set by Rebecca Kamau. Muteti has set her sights on the KSF national championships set for next weekend at Moi, Kasarani and hopes to represent Kenya at the World short course Championships in Budapest in Hungary in July. &ldquo;I am in good form and I hope I can carry the momentum to the nationals and better my time in various strokes and represent Kenya at the world event in Hungary,&rdquo; she added. Muteti is also eyeing a scholarship to the United States after her plans to go to the Plymouth University in the United Kingdom last year failed to materialise after failing to raise the required funds.Elsewhere, the Kenya team to the CANA Zone 4 Championships slated for Zimbabwe left the country yesterday for the four-day event, starting on Thursday in Bulawayo. Ambar Muhando is the girls' team captain and will be assisted by Emilia Ostman while Samuel Ndonga and Mansur Khan will take charge of the boys&rsquo; team. Ndonga is optimistic of a good performance in Zimbabwe. Kenya will be up against 12 countries including hosts Zimbabwe, Angola, Malawi, Mozambique, Seychelles, Tanzania, Zambia, Botswana, Madagascar, Mauritius, Namibia, South Africa and Uganda.
