It really was a rare a privilege hosting immediate former President of Ghana, His Excellency John Dramani Mahama, at Mindspeak on Saturday. When Phanice confirmed his attendance, I immersed myself in &lsquo;&rsquo;Dramani&rsquo;&rsquo; and what I discovered was that my guest was a polymath. His book (which I found in the Library of the Muthaiga Club), My First Coup d&rsquo;&Eacute;tat and Other True Stories From the Lost Decades of Africa, is beautiful and lyrical.He describes a magical world and in one section he writes of the Simpa, or full-moon dance. Simpa would take place in the village square when the moon was &ldquo;huge, round, and electric white against the black sky&rdquo;. Villagers would start to sing. Then young women would begin to dance seductively, and young men would tap them on the shoulder and ask to join them. &ldquo;As the evening went on under the light of that moon,&rdquo; Mahama says, &ldquo;people would find partners not only for dancing but also for life.&rdquo; I learnt that Mahama is a devotee of Afrobeat music and immersed myself in Fela Kuti and enjoyed &lsquo;Afrodisiac&rsquo; best. President Mahama was the first &lsquo;born-free&rsquo; President of Ghana. And as I thought about the man, I realised that now for so many of us it&rsquo;s actually the &lsquo;born-free&rsquo; generation that speaks our language. Of course, I have been following the markets in Ghana for quite a while and the President said: &lsquo;&rsquo;You know the Cedi was the worst-performing currency in the world, and then a year or two later we were the best-performing currency.&rsquo;&rsquo; And I said quietly: &lsquo;&rsquo;You remember [which he obviously did].&rsquo;&rsquo; President Mahama conceded the election to President Nana Akufo-Addo in record-breaking time. Mahama was a key player in the ECOWAS team that prised President Yahya Jammeh out of power. When it comes to democratic credentials, Mahama is self-evidently off the charts. He is what Malcolm Gladwell called an &lsquo;&rsquo;outlier&rsquo;&rsquo;. &ldquo;The more we investigate the reasons for African prosperity, the more we&rsquo;ll find that democracy is one of them,&rdquo; HE @JDMahama #Mindspeak. &ldquo;Democratic nations unleash the creative nature of its people&rdquo; @JDMahama &ldquo;Extreme partisanship is worse than dictatorship because it stifles development &amp; progress.&rdquo; @JDMahama &ldquo;And we need to accelerate trade among ourselves in Africa &amp; create opportunities for prosperity for our young people&rsquo;&rsquo; @JDMahama. However, the most powerful comment was: &ldquo;Leave when the applause is loudest&rsquo;&rsquo; &ndash; and he described how the loudest applause he ever received was when he entered the Backstair square on the day of President Akufo-Addo&rsquo;s inauguration, and of course after he had already conceded.Aly-Khan is a financial analyst
