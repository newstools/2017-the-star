The High court has temporarily suspended the implementation of the Murang'a County Supplementary Appropriation Act 2017.The orders were issued in Nairobi on Monday after two Murang&rsquo;a residents moved to court last week to challenge the decision by the county assembly to pass the Bill that was immediately signed by Governor Mwangi Wairia.In his ruling, judge Chacha Mwita said the county should not use any funds as captured in the supplementary budget, pending the hearing and determination of the case. The case was filed by residents Peter Mwangi and Allan Mburu. The two said the law will allow transfer of development funds to recurrent expenditure. They have said effecting such transfer was suspicious, bearing in mind this is an election year.In their application to the court, the two said the fact that these activities are being undertaken in an election year, shows there is a high likelihood the MCAs and the executive intend to use it as a ploy to loot public funds. &ldquo;The actions smack of impunity and disregard of the Constitution,&rdquo; the court was told. They have said the actions of the county assembly and the county executive disregard clear provisions of the Constitution and the Public Finance management Act.They also said items, sought to be effected by the supplementary budget, exceed the original county budget by more than 10 per cent, which is a violation of the Public Management (County Governments) Regulations, 2015.The Controller of Budget is now barred from approving the implementation of the Act or authorising the release of funds until the court gives further directions.The case will be heard on February 21.
