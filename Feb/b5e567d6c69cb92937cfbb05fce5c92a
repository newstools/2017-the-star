It named a National Coordinating Committee. The presidential candidate and running mate are expected to be unveiled before May. Opposition leaders also announced they had reserved the name NASA, pending registration as a new political outfit. The announcement was made by Cord leaders Raila Odinga (ODM), Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper) and Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula (Ford-Kenya) &mdash; and Mudavadi at Serena Hotel in Nairobi.They announced they will&nbsp; hold a major rally in Bomet Town on Saturday to galvanise support for the new alliance.

By not registering means you are an enemy of &nbsp;democracy."&nbsp;He said some of the people uncomfortable with his entry had forgotten that he supported Raila in 2007. He said he hopes the new IEBC commissioners will do a good job."We can only hope there will be strong observer mission and that IEBC will allow the will of the people will be reflected," Mudavadi said.The 11-member National Coordinating Committee announced yesterday will prepare the alliance's instruments ahead of the unveiling of its presidential candidate. &ldquo;This alliance is a special purpose movement to uproot the Jubilee regime from power for its misrule and abdication of responsibility, and its collusion in runaway corruption and the dwindling state of Kenya&rsquo;s economy,&rdquo; Raila saidReading a&nbsp; joint statement in turns, Kaloszo said, &ldquo;We want to bring hope and happiness back to our land. Jubilee must go.&rdquo;They agreed to create a technical and strategy team to support&nbsp; the coordinating committee.It is to be responsible for the coalition agreement to secure a smooth transition after the general election, maintain stability and unity in the coalition after the election.&nbsp;The two organs will be answerable to the NASA co-principals and will start work immediately, making proposals to be ratified by coalition leaders.Tasks ahead include drafting a joint election platform, manifesto and blueprint on urgent issues, developing organisational framework and structures for the coalition and secretariat.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
