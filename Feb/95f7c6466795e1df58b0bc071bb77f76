President Uhuru Kenyatta has urged the youth to enlist as voters in large numbers, saying their vote will shape the country&rsquo;s future.President Kenyatta said young people &ndash; who constitute the largest percentage of the Kenyan population &ndash; have the ability to determine the quality of leaders the country will have if they register as voters and participate in the coming general election.&ldquo;But without a voter&rsquo;s card you cannot participate in choosing the leaders you want during theAugust 8 General Election. Consequently, you will be used and dumped by politicians because you will not have the power to influence political decisions through the ballot,&rdquo; President Kenyatta said.The President was speaking on Saturday when he traversed Nakuru County, making stopovers at Ngata, Salgaa, Sachangwan, Kibunja, Mau Summit, Total Junction, Molo, Elburgon and Njoro among a host of other market centres to mobilise residents to enlist as voters before the close of the registration exercise.He emphasized that the voter&rsquo;s card is a key weapon that each citizen 18 years and above requires to determine their future.&ldquo;You do not register as a voter because you are forced to do so by a leader. You register because you want to safeguard your future,&rsquo;&rsquo; the Head of State told the youth.President Kenyatta also called on Kenyans to support Jubilee &ndash; the party that stands for peace, unity and progress &ndash; so that the country can continue on the path of growth and development.Spreading the message of peace and unity, President Kenyatta urged Kenyans &ndash; especially the youth &ndash; to shun the outdated divisive politics of tribalism and hatred propagated by the Opposition.&ldquo;Lies, tribalism, hatred and divisive politics will not help the country achieve its development targets,&rdquo; President Kenyatta said.He particularly censured the Opposition for inciting neighbouring communities to block the construction of the multi-billion Itare dam, which will provide water to over 800,000 residents of Nakuru town, Kuresoi, Molo, Njoro and Rongai.&ldquo;Stop playing politics with projects that are implemented by the Government to transform the lives of Kenyans,&rdquo; President Kenyatta told the Opposition.The President assured that the Government&rsquo;s focus on improving the lives of Kenyans through implementation development projects will not be derailed by noise from the Opposition.
