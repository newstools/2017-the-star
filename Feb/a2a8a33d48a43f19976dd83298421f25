A man found guilty of violently robbing his neighbour at their residence was sentenced to death by a Kibera court. Douglas Jiveet Obiero and two others not before the court were charged two years ago with violently robbing Richard Kipuchi in Kawangware on March 14, 2015 of Sh155,000 TV, iPad, laptop and digital camera and Sh80,000 withdrawn using his ATM card. Senior Principal magistrate Elizabeth Juma in her ruling acquitted Protus Madegon and Kennedy Kisiali of the charges for lack of evidence. However, she convicted Obiero of the charge and said the evidence produced before the court had proven beyond reasonable doubt that he committed the offence. Juma said the testimony of the key witness, the victim, implicated Obiero. Kipuchi said he was with his wife when he heard someone knock on the door and call his nickname.The wife opened the door and was confronted by a gunman they knew.
