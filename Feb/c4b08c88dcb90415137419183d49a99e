The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission has received more than 800,000 voter transfer applications and is working on stopping involuntary transfer, CEO Ezra Chiloba has said.Countrywide mass voter registration began on January 16 and ends today.There are allegations that some politicians are paying off people to change voting stations.On Sunday, three suspects were arrested in Eastleigh, Nairobi, over illegal voter transfer to Mandera North.Chiloba said, &ldquo;We know that some aspirants, due to the implementation of devolution that has led to elective seats being quite competitive, would be tempted to urge some voters to transfer in alignment of their support.&rdquo;He said the IEBC has centralised the transfer application to the constituency level, as opposed to previously when the applications were left open to all registration centres.&ldquo;This was propelled by the observation that the transfers were not deliberate. You could openly see some people pushing voters and giving them money to transfer their vote,&rdquo; Chiloba said.He said the transfer applications will be scrutinised.&ldquo;By the end of next month we will be able to know those who have double or even triple transfer applications and we will take action against them,&rdquo; Chiloba said.NO EXTENSIONThe CEO said there will be no extension of voter registration"IEBC will need to test the credibility of the voter register beginning May 10, which will be 90 days before the election. We need to do verification with a certain number of registered voters (One they would have reached by the end of the exercise) and this will take some time as we need to collect data from all stations. From this we will know the number of voters we need to eliminate from the list, cases of double registration and many others,&rdquo; he said. However, this would be in exemption of voters being listed in prisons, which will go on between February 14-27 before moving on to those in the diaspora, which will only target Kenyans in East Africa and South Africa.
