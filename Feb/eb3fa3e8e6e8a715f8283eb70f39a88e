Rift Valley leaders who have turned their backs on Deputy President William Ruto&rsquo;s Jubilee Party remain noncommital on whether they will join NASA.On Saturday, Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto and other Rift leaders hosted the top NASA leadership in Bomet town.In their speeches, Rutto, Kanu secretary general Nick Salat and Emurua Dikirr MP Johana Ng&rsquo;eno criticised the DP and Jubilee Party leaders for telling them to keep off NASA.However, they avoided saying whether they will join the outfit.Rutto had to repeatedly stand up and calm the crowd, which included Jubilee supporters, as they tried to disrupt the rally.When he spoke, Rutto said Bomet is a Chama Cha Mashinani zone.&ldquo;Jubilee should allow the leaders to exercise their democratic rights, irrespective of their political affiliation, instead of trying to disrupt such meetings. If they don&rsquo;t, they should prepare to go home come the August poll,&rdquo; he said.Ng&rsquo;eno dismissed leaders who criticised him for associating with the opposition, saying the Constitution guarantees freedom of association.&ldquo;These leaders should stop lecturing us on who to work with because the opposition leaders are also Kenyans,&rdquo; he said.Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka said the launch of NASA signifies a new dawn. He said the hope of many Kenyans lies within the new outfit.He urged Rutto to join NASA to increase its chances of defeating Jubilee.Kalonzo, ODM leader Raila Odinga, Ford Kenya&rsquo;s Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula and ANC&rsquo;s Musalia Mudavadi have been trying to woo several Rift Valley leaders to NASA.Rutto and Baringo Senator Gideon Moi, who is also Kanu chairman, have been fighting for control of Rift Valley with Ruto.Speaking separately, Moi, who was hosting Kanu members from Mogotio subcounty, launched an attack on Ruto, accusing him of lying to Rift Valley about projects launched.Moi questioned Ruto&rsquo;s interest in Baringo and West Pokot counties, which he termed Kanu zones. Ruto has visited the county more than 25 times. Raila trashed Jubilee projects, saying Presdient Uhuru Kenyatta and Ruto have failed.
