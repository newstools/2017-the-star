The US government has dismissed claims that it has inked a deal with Kenya towards the purchase of weapons to be used in bolstering the war against al Shabaab.There are reports that Kenya entered into a Sh43 billion deal with the US which would have seen the country acquire state-of- -the-art equipment to support KDF.But Ambassador Robert Godec, in a press statement on Saturday, said the United States and Kenya have not signed any agreement to that effect.He said engagements between US and Kenya on the weapons deal are still being discussed, citing Washington's commitment to support the fight against terrorism."The public discussion around the potential purchase of the aircraft underscores the transparency and accountability of the &ldquo;Foreign Military Sales&rdquo; program," he said.Kenya is set to acquire an AT802-L &ldquo;Air Tractor&rdquo; aircraft, a process Godec said would be carried out wholly in keeping with appropriate laws and regulations. Godec said: "If concluded, Kenya would purchase not just an aircraft, but training, spare parts, ammunition, and weapons systems,"The statement comes in the wake of US congressman Tedd Budd sought to halt the procurement of the 12 converted agricultural aircrafts.Read: US Congressman wants Kenya's Sh43 billion arms deal stoppedAlso read: United States approves Sh43 billion KDF weapons deal"The US military sales process requires notification of the US Congress," Godec said."...and allows oversight committees and commercial competitors the opportunity to review the entire package before it is offered to a potential buyer," he added."With the approval of the US Congress, Kenya's Ministry of Defence will receive a detailed US Government document describing each item to be purchased and service to be provided along with an estimated cost before they negotiate the final price and delivery timetable," the envoy said.Godec said this gives the Ministry of Defence the opportunity to 'review the offer line by line and make a final determination on the Air Tractor aircraft package'.He said the Foreign Military Sales program is one way the US Government works closely with the Kenyan Government to assist the military."As one measure of our support, the United States has provided over $150 million (Sh15.5 billion) in equipment and assistance to the Kenyan military in the past year alone," Godec said.
