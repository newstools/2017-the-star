Lawmakers from Kitui county yesterday endorsed Senator David Musila (pictured) for governor, putting Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka in a fix on the candidate to back in the August 8 polls.Eight Kitui MPs, led by National Assembly minority leader Francis Nyenze, declared support for Musila and accused Governor Julius Malombe of sidelining them in development and misusing county funds. County leaders, including MCAs supporting Musila and Malombe, have clashed following reports that Kalonzo &lsquo;endorsed&rsquo; the incumbent&rsquo;s reelection. However, the Wiper leader has denied having a preferred candidate or endorsing any aspirant.&ldquo;We are sending a message to Kalonzo that he has the freedom to support whoever he wants and we have the freedom to support whoever we want,&rdquo; Nyenze said at Parliament Buildings.The lawmakers, under the Kitui County Parliamentary Forum, said they regret teaming up in 2013 to help Malombe win the seat. They said he turned against them and fielded rivals to unseat them.Nyenze said their effort to compel Malombe to embrace teamwork has been in vain, hence Musila is their best choice to unite all county leaders and spur development. &ldquo;The governor adopted a divide-and-rule strategy by working with MCAs and isolating MPs from decision-making. The strategy worked well for him but led to serious challenges in delivering expected development to marginalised people,&rdquo; he said. The group questioned how Sh30 billion the county received since devolution was spent.
