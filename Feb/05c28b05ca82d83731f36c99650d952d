A proposed Bill to transform the Agricultural Finance Corporation into a commercial bank has been backed by Parliament.Yatta MP Francis Mwangangi drafted the Agriculture Development Bank Bill.Once established, the Agriculture Development Bank would offer affordable credit to farmers.Yesterday, members of the National Assembly&rsquo;s Agriculture Committee said the proposed legislation is long overdue.They said the AFC lacks the financial muscle to meet the high demand for loans from farmers facing pressure to adopt innovative farming methods.The law does not allow the corporation to receive loans from other financial institutions. AFC relies on government funding.&ldquo;It is an ambitious Bill and I really must say I support it. We need to invite the Treasury to submit reports on the viability of the legislation,&rdquo; Bungoma East MP Ben Washiali said.The committee agreed to invite Treasury CS Henry Rotich to assess the impact of the Bill on the Banking Act, which regulates lending by commercial banks.Uriri MP John Kobado said, &ldquo;We need to find out how this will work, given that the Central Bank of Kenya relies on the Act to regulate the industry.&rdquo;
