Parliament will have to amend its Standing Orders to reduce the size of committees if they are to be efficient, National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi has said.He said on Friday Parliament erred by increasing the size of House panels, the engines driving legislation.Speaking during the seventh and last leadership retreat of the 11th Parliament in Mombasa, Muturi said the committees are currently bloated and this undermines their effectiveness. Currently, departmental committees have 29 members, while sessional committees have 51. They were expanded to accommodate the House&rsquo;s 349 members after the 2013 election.Muturi jokingly said some committees have as many as 51 members, almost the size of the Senate. He said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve learnt our lessons. The next Parliament must look at the issue of bloated committee to optimally increase the efficiency and efficacy.&rdquo;Majority leader Aden Duale shared his sentiments. &ldquo;We should have instead increased the number of committees,&rdquo; he said. He suggested the House Standing Orders be amended to reduce the number of committee members. Muturi urged the next Parliament to seek more public input in its business, calling that a major challenge for the 11th Parliament. &ldquo;We must be serious with public participation,&rdquo; he said.Public participation is one of the cardinal values of the Constitution. Busia Senator Amos Wako and Luanda MP Chris Omulele have sponsored bills to improve public involvement.
