A judge yesterday froze the accounts of a former IEBC commissioner who represented Telkom Kenya employees retrenched in 2006.Justice Grace Nzioka ordered Thomas Letangule and two other lawyers to appear in court over money received on behalf of more than 2,000 former Telkom Kenya employees.The judge ordered the freezing of Letangule (pictured) and lawyer Antony Oluoch accounts, pending the hearing and determination of the case filed by the 2,026 former employees. It is alleged that Letangule received Sh1.3 billion on behalf of the retrenchees, while Oluoch received Sh500 million.In the case, Telkom Kenya agreed in a consent recorded before the Employment and Labour Relations Court to pay its former workers Sh1.8 billion. In the consent the lawyers fees was agreed at Sh30 million (Letangule) and Sh20million (Oluoch). According to the consent, Sh150,000,043 was to be remitted as tax to the KRA.But workers never received what they had claimed as per the list presented to the court by the lawyers. They only found small amounts deposited into their accounts. The former employees urged Nzioka to compel lawyers Letangule, Oluoch and SM Kitonga to tabulate how they spent the millions. The judge dismissed an objection by the lawyers to have the case thrown out. The lawyers argued that the case was frivolous and raised no triable issues. But the judge said, &ldquo;The litigants have a right to know how the money received on their behalf by the lawyers was spent.&rdquo;
