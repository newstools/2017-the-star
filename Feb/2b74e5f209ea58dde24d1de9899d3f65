Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya&rsquo;s differences with Senator Juma Boy were evident during Boy&rsquo;s burial in Vanga on Monday. Boy died on Sunday.This was after irate youths turned away a driver carrying chairs, water and tents for the event, sent by Mvurya&rsquo;s government. Some members of the public were upset that all burial arrangements were made by the Mombasa government, instead of Kwale which the senator represented. Mvurya and Deputy Governor Fatuma Achani did not attend the burial.Yesterday, Mvurya told the Star he was in a meeting and promised to call later about the burial. Mvurya and Boy argued bitterly in the media over various issues, including extension of Base Titanian&rsquo;s mining area. The senator strongly opposed it. This was after the governor joined Jubilee &ldquo;for development&rdquo;.
