Kilifi residents have been told to hold the county government to account for the billions of shillings allocated to it by the state.On Monday, Deputy President William Ruto said, &ldquo;The national government has given out Sh9.6 billion to the Kilifi government, making it the fourth largest recipient of county allocations. It is surprising to hear you say you don&rsquo;t have water in Kaloleni. This is the question those in the county should answer.&rdquo;He spoke during a tour. Some residents have complained about the lack of fresh water for days. Ruto said county officials should work hard to ensure water is available to everyone.He said it is a shame many residents live in poverty. Ruto urged residents to ask hard questions, including &ldquo;why most projects undertaken by the county have not benefited them&rdquo;.Ruto said the national government is ready to cooperate with the county to ensure the water problem is addressed. He urged the county to show commitment.&ldquo;Water distribution is a devolved function, but as the national government, we will not watch our people suffer,&rdquo; Ruto said.Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi blamed the national government for the water shortage.&ldquo;We do not have water in Kilifi and parts of Mombasa because Kenya Power disconnected electricity at the main source in Baricho. And Baricho is managed by the Coast Water Services Board - a national government parastatal.&rdquo;
