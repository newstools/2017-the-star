Saba Saba Asili has backed Governor Evans Kidero&rsquo;s reelection. &ldquo;As a party we support Uhuru Kenyatta for President, but we are supporting Kidero as an individual because of what he has done for the residents,&rdquo; secretary general Joe Kangucho said on Sunday. He said Jubilee Party hopeful Peter Kenneth is a &ldquo;smart and clean man who will not have time for the poor Nairobians&rdquo;. &ldquo;Kidero attended our Akorino Church at Nyamakima on Sunday and pledged to give us land for construction. What else should we expect from leader?&rdquo; Kangucho said
