Ten pastors and seven church board members have been arrested over a disagreement concerning the management of a Bible school.The seven people who belong to the Church of Restoration in Thika were arrested on Friday.Thika Deputy OCPD Bernard Ayoo said they raided International Gospel Outreach Bible School after they were alerted by principal David Njoroge.The OCPD said Njoroge told them a group of armed pastors had stormed into the school and locked its gates, and was destroying property."We detained the suspects and they recorded statements," Ayoo told the Star adding investigations began immediately.The principal said the wrangles resulted from the church leader's claim that they owned the land on which the school sits.Njoroge said the plot was bought in 2004 by US-based missionary John Ford, and that construction began immediately after.The principal, who pastors the college chapel, castigated the pastors for the destruction of prpoerty.But board member Alice Ruhiu said the principal and the board were in disagreement over an audit report.Ruhiu, who accompanied a group of church lawyers to seek the release of the 17, said the report revealed mismanagement of college funds.She said a decision was made for Njoroge to be interdicted but that he rushed to court to obtain orders restricting his employers from taking action against him.Ruhiu said the principal's refusal to leave office forced them to storm into the school.&ldquo;Njoroge is an employee of the church, which owns the school. How can we destroy our own property,&rdquo; she asked.The pastors and board members were released on Sh5,000 cash bail each pending investigations that will determine whether they should be charged on Monday.
