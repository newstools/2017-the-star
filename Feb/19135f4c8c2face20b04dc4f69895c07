NASA leaders have told Jubilee to be ready for a showdown in the August 8 general elections.During a rally in Bomet on Saturday, the opposition leaders said they would ensure Jubilee incurs massive loses in the polls."We are witnessing a time where the Jubilee government has made life almost unbearable for our people. They favour specific areas for development and it is time we now solve these historical injustices," ODM leader Raila Odinga said."We can achieve that by starting with them going home," he added.He criticised DP William Ruto and President Uhuru Kenyatta of "touring the world" as key needs affecting Kenyans are yet to be met."They do not seem bothered. Jubilee promises are just hot air," Raila said.He asked Chama cha Mashiani leader Isaac Rutto and Kanu's Nick Salat to join NASA for a strong opposition against Uhuru.More on this: I&rsquo;m not defecting to NASA, but I welcome politicians to seek votes in Bomet &ndash; RuttoAlso read: NASA will take care of all Opposition leaders, Mudavadi says amid fallout fearsWiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka also asked the opposition to unite and ensure they deliver on promised made to the electorate."The nation is bigger than us all and we will do this to ensure inclusivity and togetherness through NASA," he said.ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi asked residents to register as voters to give the opposition numbers to win the election."We formed NASA, not because we need a part, but because we need a house where we can all join forces and do what is good for the nation," he said."We are ready to realign the wheel that drives this nation to end rampant corruption, theft and loss of resources among others," he said.Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang'ula asked Uhuru to withdraw KDF forces in Somalia to provide security within the country."We continue to see our forces being attacked and our sons losing their lives in wars that we are not part of, it is time that the Jubilee government worked towards having our forces brought back home," he said.The Senator also castigated the Jubilee government for allegedly spending money to campaign for the AUC candidature of Foreign Affairs CS Amina Mohammed.The NASA leaders said they will work on ensuring devolution works for all, security among the people, enough food and education among others.Early this week, NASA coordinating committee hit the ground running, just a day after it was formed, to spearhead the search for the coalition's presidential candidate.Read: Luhyas will unanimously vote for Jubilee if Raila is NASA flag bearer - MP OtsiulaThe Star has established that the 12-member team drawn from ODM, Wiper, ANC and Ford Kenya, the Nasa affiliate parties, met on Thursday evening.The venue was a top secret but the meeting lay down rules of engagement.A source in the coalition who sought anonymity said first on the agenda was the election of Senators James Orengo (ODM, Siaya) and Johnson Muthama (Wiper, Machakos), and MPs Sakwa Bunyasi (ANC, Nambale) and Eseli Simiyu (Ford Kenya, Tongaren) as co-chairs.&ldquo;We are now ready to move.
