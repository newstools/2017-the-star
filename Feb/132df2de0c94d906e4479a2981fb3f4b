The NLC is on the spot for allegedly acquiring Lamu residents&rsquo; land for a steal.The commission acquired the land for national projects, including the Lapsset project and the Kwasasi coal plant.A group of landowners presented their grievances to the National Assembly Lands committee on Sunday. They accused NLC chairman Muhammad Swazuri of sitting back and watching as grabbers steal their land.The Lands committee visited Lamu following a petition filed by woman representative Shakilla Abdalla citing illegal allocations. Kililana Landowners Association chairman Bakari Famau told the committee a big percentage of genuine landowners have not been compensated for their land, where the coal plant will be built.He said the commission &ldquo;knowingly paid impostors and ghost claimants&rdquo;.Bakari said the NLC acquired more land than agreed on and paid for.&ldquo;The 70,000 acres the NLC declared belongs to Lapsset wasn&rsquo;t in the initial agreement. The Lapsset land wasn&rsquo;t even supposed to be half of that. Most of us lost our land and were never paid a penny since impostors and ghost claimants invaded the process,&rdquo; he said. Bakari added, &ldquo;We feel conned and helpless. The NLC chairman is aware of what is going on because we tried to reach him to discuss the matter but he didn&rsquo;t give us the time of day.&rdquo;
