On February 18, 2010, the first trees were planted on the Nairobi Greenline, an initiative of the Kenya Association of Manufacturers, largely due to the vision of the late Anoop Shah. This was done under the management of the Kenya Wildlife Service, corporate organisations and many schools. A dedicated team still cares for the forest.Over 250,000 indigenous trees have been planted, effectively &ldquo;drawing a line&rdquo; over 30km long and 50m wide along the park&rsquo;s eastern boundary. However, many trees were destroyed due to the southern bypass project. Now that many &ldquo;baby trees&rdquo; are planted, continuous responsibility starts, to &ldquo;parent the forest trees to maturity&rdquo;. Just like how in a family we nurture our children to grow up strong, so this forest will still need plenty of loving care from many people over the next few years, especially watering in the dry season and weeding when needed. People should actively nurture it to maturity, until the trees are strong enough to stand alone.The project provides a natural buffer to protect the park from pollution, encroachment and human wildlife conflict, as we &ldquo;protect the park from ourselves&rdquo;. Its rich ecosystem faces massive environmental risks due to plans to develop highways and railway lines, human settlements, effluent discharge, poaching and pollution of water, land and air.The Nairobi Greenline is a fantastic example of what people can do to transform their landscape. The actions of this generation will have a dramatic effect on future generations. Let us all hope and pray that in 2046 when the Nairobi National Park celebrates 100 years, the Nairobi Greenline will be a wonderful mature forest.The park is open daily from 06h00 to 19h00For more information on the park you can link to the following websites www.kws.org or www.nairobigreenline.com or on Facebook &ndash; Nairobi National Park
