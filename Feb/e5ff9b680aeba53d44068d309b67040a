Kakamega Senate aspirant Alex Mukabwa yesterday urged the opposition to swiftly name its joint flagbearer so it can consolidate its support across the country. He said the long delay in naming the candidate is creating confusion in opposition zones. Mukabwa said the country is tired of Jubilee and is waiting for direction. The hopeful will contest on the ANC ticket. &ldquo;Voters get confused when the opposition leaders run in different directions, each declaring himself the best bet. This gives Jubilee a chance to spin their script that the opposition is a confused lot when we&rsquo;re not,&rdquo; he said. Opposition chiefs Raila Odinga (ODM), Musalia Mudavadi (ANC), Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper) and Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula (Ford Kenya) met on Monday to lay the ground for selection of the Cord-NASA flagbearer. They agreed to form a technical committee to come up with the best method of picking the person to face Jubilee&rsquo;s Uhuru Kenyatta.
