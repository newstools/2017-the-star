The National Treasury will advance loans to county governments that are in dire need of quick funds and have nothing in their coffers.This will enable counties get cheaper credit instead of the current expensive loans and guarantees from local banks.The National Treasury will in turn deduct the funds "agreeably" with the borrowers from their yearly county allocation.This was ratified at a meeting of the Inter-Governmental Budget and Economic Council chaired by Deputy President William Ruto at his Karen residence, Nairobi."After discussion with the Central Bank of Kenya, we have found a mechanism to provide funds to counties upfront in the event there is an urgent need," National Treasury CS Henry Rotich said.He also announced that donors have given the government Sh5.5 billion for health transformation, agriculture and county facilities.Ruto said using the National Treasury to issue the loans will make it easy for counties as they will not need guarantees."The Central Bank of Kenya is comfortable with the National Treasury issuing the loans because the National Treasury can guarantee itself," he said.The meeting brought together governors, county officials, Cabinet Secretaries, Permanent Secretaries, officials from the Commission of Revenue Allocation, Parliament and Controller of Budget.Governors Wycliffe Oparanya (Kakamega), Sospeter Ojaamong (Busia), John Mruttu (Taita Taveta) and Joshua Irungu (Laikipia), Health CS Cleopa Mailu and Controller of Budget Agnes Odhiambo attended the meeting.
