Embu Livestock Development chief officer Monicah Cyombua (pictured) has urged the county and national governments to provide relief food to starving Mbeere residents. Many rivers that residents relied on have dried up and the rains have failed because of the felling of trees for charcoal burning and sand-harvesting, she said. Cyombua spoke to the press in Embu town.
