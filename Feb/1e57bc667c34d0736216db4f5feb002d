More than 50,174 shared national ID numbers are legitimate and had been accepted as part of the voters register, IEBC chief executive Ezra Chiloba has said.The commission publicly acknowledged that 128,926 Kenyans share ID or passport numbers in its database, allegations that were first raised by Raila and his co-principal Kalonzo Musyoka.But it only released a list of 78,752 voters with shared numbers. The list included 21,149 records that bore the same ID numbers and same names, and 57,603 records whose ID numbers did not match those at the National Registration Bureau.Chiloba said those whose names are listed among the 78,752 should visit the constituency offices where they were registered to verify and correct any discrepancies ahead of August 8 poll.&ldquo;Those who will not have verified and corrected their records within 10 days from February 6 run the risk of having their names expunged from the register,&rdquo; he said in a statement on Tuesday.The details can also be accessed through the commission&rsquo;s website, www.iebc.or.ke.Read: 128,926 voters sharing ID, passport numbers, IEBC confirmsAlso read: IEBC finds 78,752 anomalies in voter registerNairobi, Kisumu and Kiambu counties lead in cases of shared national ID numbers in the voter register, data from the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission shows.According to the electoral agency, there are 7,441 cases of shared IDs in Nairobi, 3, 946 in Kisumu and 3,500 in Kiambu.Other counties with more than 3,000 shared ID details are Kakamega (3,481), Siaya (3,307), Meru (3,289) and Nakuru (3,261).Read: Nairobi leads in shared ID details in listing driveMore on this: IEBC falls short of target in first phase of mass voter registration exerciseCord leader Raila Odinga reported double registration of his ID number after the Interior ministry said Wiper's Kalonzo Musyoka lied about a similar occurrence.He then asked the IEBC to stop the mischief saying "this is exactly the kind of mischief that we have been opposing in the run-up to the election".The Cord leader said the list of voters needs a thorough bio-metric audit by a credible firm with a proven track record.Read: Nakuru voters complain of machine failure as IEBC listing kicks off
