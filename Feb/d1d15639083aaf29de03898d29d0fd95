US President Donald Trump used the swearing-in ceremony of Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Thursday to sign three executive orders, including ones targeting transnational drug cartels and those who commit crimes against law enforcement. "These dangerous times require a determined attorney general," Trump said at an Oval Office ceremony for Sessions, who said rising crime is a "dangerous, permanent trend" in the United States and also promised to "end this lawlessness" of illegal immigration. Recently, the US recently extradited Mexican drug kingpin Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman to a New York jail.Guzman, 59, who has escaped two maximum-security jails in Mexico, is on 23-hour lockdown in a special unit in the federal jail in Manhattan, according to his lawyers, and has been prevented from seeing Coronel and his Mexican attorney.Shortly after, two suspected drug barons from Kenya and their foreign counterparts were extradited to New York to face drug trafficking charges. Baktash Akasha, who US prosecutors say led a Kenyan crime family called the Akasha organisation that was involved in distributing heroin and methamphetamine, arrived in New York from Kenya along with three co-defendants on January 30. His co-defendants include Ibrahim Akasha, his brother; Gulam Hussein, a Pakistani charged with heading a drug transportation network; and Vijaygiri Goswami, an Indian businessman accused of managing the Akasha organisation's drug business.
