Bungoma Governor Ken Lusaka has asked Water CS Eugene Wamalwa to return home and run for the Trans Nzoia governor seat in the August 8 polls.He said the region would benefit from synergy if Bungoma and Trans Nzoia came under Jubilee leadership."Charity begins at home. I am pleading with Eugene to come and vie for Trans Nzoia. It will be my joy to put our heads together with him as governors of these two regions," he said on Saturday.Lusaka was addressing mourners during the burial of Mama Regina Nasike, the aunt to Wamalwa.He said the CS is able and equal to the task.The remarks elicited excitement from attendees who chanted and ululated "rudi nyumbani."Read: I did not meet 'desperate' Wetang'ula, Eugene Wamalwa saysSaboti MP Lazaro Wafula said he was tired of many questions being fielded to him by the public about Eugene's bid."It is getting crazy. And the load is becoming too heavy on my back. I do not want to be seen as a liar. Bwana CS, I have worked with you for long. I know your leadership abilities, please make it public today," Wafula said.But Wamalwa shied away from making any announcement, saying he "does not want to play politics at the funeral"."It is sad I have lost her," the CS said, adding: "She played a critical role in shaping my future."Wamalwa encouraged residents to register as voters in large numbers."People are registering as voters in large numbers elsewhere. Let us do the same because it is by doing so that you will be able to elect your desired leaders," he said.Wamalwa had initially declared interest in the Nairobi governor seat but has been backing off slowly.More on this: CS Wamalwa in dilemma over Nairobi, Trans Nzoia governor's seatAlso read: Mount Kenya MPs endorse Water CS Wamalwa's 2017 bid for Nairobi governorThere has been speculation that the CS might heed to President Uhuru Kenyatta's call to ministers not to resign and bid for elective posts.The deadline for civil servants seeking elective posts to resign is February 8.Already, Uhuru dissuaded Devolution CS Mwangi Kiunjiru from resigning to bid for Laikipia governor.
