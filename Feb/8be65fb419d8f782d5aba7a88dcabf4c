A meeting called by Chuka University lecturers over the ongoing strike was disrupted by a colleague who brandished a panga. Charles Kinyua arrived late for the Wednesday morning meeting and demanded to be told who had called him a traitor. &ldquo;I urged him to calm down and talk politely with the members,&rdquo; chapter secretary general Thomas Motindi said yesterday. &ldquo;[But] he rushed to his car, came out with a panga and threatened to cut the [University Academic Staff Union] officials into pieces. We all scampered for safety.&rdquo; The meeting was at Ndagani shopping centre. Motindi said they reported to police. &ldquo;We expect the law will take its course. If members have agreed to join the nationwide strike in solidarity, we expect to be protected and not attacked,&rdquo; he said. Lecturers from all public universities have vowed to continue their strike until the 2013-17 CBA is negotiated, signed, registered and implemented.
