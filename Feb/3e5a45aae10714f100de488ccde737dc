The Jubilee Party will field a candidate for Machakos governor. On Tuesday JP regional coordinator Victor Munyaka said the party will field candidates for all positions.&ldquo;We have resolved there is no way we will shelve our ambitions of aspiring to a particular position in favour of any party,&rdquo; he said.Munyaka said being an independent party with a national outlook, JP will not enter into a coalition with any party but will only support candidates running on its ticket.&ldquo;We dissolved all the affiliate parties to form the Jubilee Party and so that means any other party that did not dissolve is not part of us,&rdquo; he said.This is a problem for Governor Alfred Mutua, who says his Maendeleo Chap Chap movement is friendly to JP.He has declared support for President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s reelection, which has been seen as an attempt to seek JP&rsquo;s support for his reelection.Mutua fell out with Wiper, on whose ticket he won the March 4, 2013, general election. He will seek reelection on his party&rsquo;s ticketWiper is the dominant party in Ukambani.Munyaka spoke during a meeting with aspirants at a hotel in Machakos. He said they are consulting and will announce the candidate soon.&ldquo;Jubilee will do its nominations independently without expecting excuses of so and so or such and such party is friendly and therefore we should not field a candidate in competition,&rdquo; Munyaka said.He said other parties are welcome to support Uhuru&rsquo;s reelection.&ldquo;If Chap Chap, or even Wiper, chooses to support the reelection of President Uhuru Kenyatta, that is welcome,&rdquo; Munyaka said.&ldquo;But they should understand that we are free to field candidates for all other positions, just as they are free to do the same.&rdquo;
