Muslims from Mumias have told leaders from the Jamia Mosque to stop using the name of religion to seek for monetary favours from politicians.Led by Ali Watako and Ali Omar, they accused Mumias Muslim Committee chairman Ismail Muchelule and his Baraza la wazee counterpart Rajab Webukha of promising politicians the Muslim vote.Watako said on Saturday every Muslim in Mumias has a right to vote for his or her preferred candidate without being influenced by the two committee officials.They spoke to journalists at the Media Centre in Mumias town.&ldquo;The mosque compound is a holy ground meant for religious activities. Inviting politicians, including non-Muslims to campaign doesn&rsquo;t go down well with the majority of the Muslims,&rdquo; Ali said.
