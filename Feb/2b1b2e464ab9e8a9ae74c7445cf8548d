Turbo MP Elisha Busienei has sacked his two aides for demanding bribes from his constituents to secure bursaries and contracts.He said his personal assistant and another aide at the CDF office have been frustrating residents and demanding bribes. Busienei said the aides had claimed he had sent them to collect the bribes. &ldquo;I gave one of them 30 forms to take to some of my people to apply so that they can go to college, but instead of delivering them he went and demanded Sh2,000 from each of the applicants, getting Sh60,000,&rdquo; the MP said.The MP said there is no way he would demand Sh2,000 from poor people.&ldquo;I had already cautioned them that as my staff I should not hear of such nonsense, but they went ahead to do it and I have fired them,&rdquo; Busienei said.
