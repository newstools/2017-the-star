The first shipment of wagons that will be deployed on the Standard Gauge Railway has arrived at the Port of Mombasa, Kenya Railways Corporation has said.KRC said it received a consignment of 60 wagons yesterday.This is the first batch of 1,620 freight haulage rolling stock that will be used for movement of cargo between Mombasa and Nairobi once SGR operations start in June this year.&ldquo;Kenya Railways is very pleased that the rolling stock has started to arrive 106 days to the launch date which gives the corporation reasonable time to start testing and commissioning in readiness for trial operations as we bring on board the rail operator on June 1 2017,&rdquo; managing director Atanas Maina said in a statement.The Standard Gauge Railway is the biggest infrastructure project in Kenya. The Mombasa-Nairobi phase of the project has been developed at a cost of $3.8 billion (about Sh393.79 billion under prevailing foreign exchange rates).According to KRC, the project is in the final phase of construction and will soon be ready for operations.The network has capacity to hold 850 metres long trains moving at 80 kilometres per hour. The rolling stock will be powered by 43 freight haulage heavy duty locomotives. KRC has so far received eight freight haulage heavy duty locomotives for mainline use.Maina says they have also placed an order for 40 passenger coaches.&ldquo;The wagons are a key deliverable under SGR as they are the means via which the high capacity Standard Gauge Railway will deliver our promise to our customers. Plans are at an advanced stage to bring on board the operations and maintenance team before the launch date,&rdquo; Maina said.He said the wagons can load 70 tonnes and are suited for loading and transporting commodities such as rolled steel products, coal, ore, building materials, mechanical facilities and timber.&ldquo;The wagons will aid in decongesting the Port of Mombasa and engineer a significant shift of bulk cargo to rail from road. They come with improved technical performance and are able to operate at a commercial speed of 120 km/h,&rdquo; he said.
