Kisii and Nyamira counties are becoming a major battle ground for NASA-affiliated parties.Already, ODM, Ford Kenya and Wiper have identified candidates for various positions in the two counties.Amani leader Musalia Mudavadi expected to visit the counties tomorrow and on Monday to name his party aspirants and encourage residents to register as voters.Bobasi parliamentary aspirant Lucas Mogoa told the Star that Mudavadi will be accompanied during his tour by the party&rsquo;s aspirants for various positions.&ldquo;He is coming to make last ditch efforts to encourage Kisii residents to vote and also drum up support for himself to be the NASA flagbearer,&rdquo; he told the Star on Friday.Amani aspirants in Kisii include Daniel Rasugu (Kitutu Chache North), Abdalla Matoke (Bomachoge Chache), Gideon Moreka (South Mugirango), Justus Mochoge and Jimmy Onkangi (Kitutu Chache South).ODM leader Raila Odinga on Monday met aspirants from Kisii county and promised a free and fair nominations.He warned aspirants against wrangles and told them that the party has learnt from past mistakes.&ldquo;We lost some seats because of bungled nominations. This time we must get it right. We want ODM to win all seats in Kisii,&rdquo; Raila said at Ufanisi Resort.The former Prime Minister added that in areas like Nairobi and Mombasa the opposition will agree on a formula for fielding candidates.On Tuesday, Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka concluded his three-day tour of the region and also named party aspirants for various positions. &ldquo;We did not fold up our parties like Jubilee. Jubilee is in serious trouble because those guys have been boxed in,&rdquo; he said&ldquo;Fielding candidates by NASA-affiliated parties will work to our advantage because if you don&rsquo;t want to run on ODM, you can contest in Wiper or Ford Kenya.&rdquo;But ODM deputy party leader Wycliffe Oparanya (Kakamega governor) has called for joint NASA nominations.Most aspirants have moved to NASA-affiliated parties following the ban of party hopping.Kisii Governor James Ongwae will face off with Wiper&rsquo;s Lumumba Nyaberi who ditched the Jubilee Party.In Nyamira, a major contest is expected between Mwancha Okioma (Ford Kenya) and retired judge David Onyancha (Wiper), while ODM&rsquo;s incumbent John Nyagarama will contest the party primaries against West Mugirango MP James Gesami and newcomer Dr John Kumenda.Ben Nyamweya will be Wiper&rsquo;s candidate in Kisii where he is likely to face Sam Ongeri, who is expected to defect to ODM, and Amani&rsquo;s George Nyamweya.Lawyer Mose Nyambega of Wiper will battle it out with fellow advocate Okong&rsquo;o O&rsquo;Mogeni of ODM. Borabu MP Ben Momanyi, who was elected on the Wiper ticket, said fielding candidates from each NASA-affiliated party does not reduce chances of winning posts.&ldquo;As Wiper, we are targeting to have at least 10 MPs from the region. We also want to control the county governments of Kisii and Nyamira,&rdquo; the MP said.
