West Pokot leaders yesterday resolved to appoint village administrators, who will report to ward administrators. The constitution states that every county should devolve its functions to the lowest practicable level &mdash; the village. This is to enable Kenyans in remote places to access services easily.The village administrators' job includes to coordinate county government functions at the village level and work with chiefs to maintain insecurity."Our county has faced insecurity issues. We are trying our level best to end perennial conflicts, that is why we need to have the village administrators to help us establish peace," Governor Simon Kachapin said.The meeting was attended by Kachapin, MCAs, subcounty and ward administrators and the public service board.Early this week an administrative officer was shot dead at Kambi Karaya by armed bandits suspected to be from a neighbouring county.The West Pokot County Village Units Delineation Bill 2016 will be tabled in the county assembly.MCA Paul Yaraki welcomedsaid the bill will facilitate administration in the villages."My people will be employed as village elders, secretaries and to other positions. This depicts the fruits of devolution," he said.
