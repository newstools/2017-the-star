Many politicians facing integrity issues &mdash; from graft and hate speech to rape &mdash; could be banned from election if lawmakers approve IEBC regulations giving the anti-graft agency sweeping vetting powers.Politicians &mdash; governors, senators, MPs and MCAs &mdash; could be disqualified from running if they have undetermined court cases. These include tax evasion, assault, fraud, falsification of academic papers, misuse of firearms, incitement to violence and others.The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission yesterday submitted to Parliament far-reaching amendments to the Election Regulations that would involve the EACC in clearing candidates.Parliament must pass the regulations.However, it could amend and water them down, even as it rejected a proposal requiring lawmakers to have academic degrees for the August election, pushing it to 2022.Under the proposed regulations, candidates must obtain a &lsquo;certified&rsquo; clearance certificate from the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission to contest.This is a drastic departure from the current situation in which candidates are only required to submit a 'self-integrity' form to the IEBC &mdash; without having it certified by the anti-graft agency, opening the way to falsification.The aim is to end the culture of rogue politicians looting public coffers while in office to recoup the money they spent on campaigns, while they amass a new war chest for the next polls.As it stands now, more than 25 well-known politicians with court cases could be in trouble, less than six months to the general election. And many who are lesser known.Those with pending court cases on various charges include Garissa Governor Nathif Jama, Kiambu Governor William Kabogo, Ganze MP Peter Shehe, Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter, nominated MP Sonia Birdi, Kitutu Chache MP Richard Onyonka, Lamu West MP Julius Ndegwa Kariuki.Others are Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria, Laikipia North MP Mathew Lempurkel, Kapsaret MP Oscar Sudi, Kasarani MP John Chege, Imenti Central MP Gideon Mwiti and Machakos Senator Johnson Muthama.&ldquo;A person shall obtain and submit clearance from the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission as prescribed under the Leadership and Integrity Act, 2012,&rdquo; reads the proposed amendment.&ldquo;Regulation 47 of the principal regulations is amended in sub-regulation (1) by inserting the word &lsquo;certified&rsquo; immediately before the words &lsquo;copies of certificates.&rdquo;The Leadership and Integrity law prescribes and sets a higher standard of conduct for public officers and outlines requirements that must be met by anyone who seeks public office.The stringent regulations by IEBC could lock out a numerous governors, MPs and MCAs facing corruption allegations from contesting in the polls.Analysts have been arguing that while the EACC is supposed to be the custodian of ethics and morals, especially so with regard to public officers, it is powerless to enforce them. At the same time, the electoral agency proposes individual political parties should finance their own nominations. The Jubilee Party has asked the IEBC to handle its primaries. In the regulations, IEBC says its role in nominations should be limited to supervision and conduct of primaries, without involvement in preparing party lists.Parties requesting the IEBC to supervise primaries shall be responsible for all preparatory work, including notifying members of date, time and venue. The parties themselves will invite, receive and process applications from aspirants and prepare the list of candidates.This includes, &ldquo;doing everything else required to be done in preparation of the party primaries.&rdquo;
