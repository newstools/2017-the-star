Gaps in Kenya's procurement law is to blame for the failure of the Buy Kenya Build Kenya initiative, manufacturers have said, calling for better policies to enhance growth of industries.The Kenya Association of Manufacturers says the government policy to give priority to locally manufactured goods over cheap imports is yet to be effected more than one-and-a-half year since president Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s directive.The policy (preference and reservation regulation) under the Public Procurement andAsset Disposal Act, 2015, is still pending in Parliament. Lack of proper legislation, therefore, continues to hamper the initiative which stipulates that 40 per cent of government agencies' purchases be comprised of goods made in Kenya.&ldquo;Loopholes in the regulatory framework are dragging us back. We gave a number of proposals in line with what the loopholes were. Once that is done, then we will have the legal framework that we need to push the Buy Kenya Build Kenya initiative,&rdquo; KAM CEO Phyllis Wakiaga told the Star in an interview.KAM lobbied for the inclusion of the local purchase clause in the government&rsquo;s performancencontracts by ministries, with an aim of holding Cabinet Secretaries and their institutions accountable. Wakiaga said manufacturers have compiled a list of local products to be shared with the Ministry of Industry, Tradeand Cooperatives for distribution to other ministries, state departments and agencies.&ldquo;Anyone who is supposed to buy the 40 per cent will not have the excuse of saying they don&rsquo;t know what is locally available,&rdquo; Wakiaga said. President Uhuru announced the initiative during the 2015 Madaraka Day celebrations.Manufacturers are lobbying for policies that will create a level playing field for its members and revitalise industrial growth. On Monday, the sector launched the Manufacturing Priority Agenda 2017 which outlines KAM's strategic intent. The programme targets to expand the sector&rsquo;s contribution to the economy by 1.6 per cent annually in the next three years, and increase the gross domestic product to 15 per cent by 2019. GDP has stagnated at 10.5 per cent in the last decade.Industry and Investment Principal Secretary Julius Korir said the government is working with the private sector to achieve the goal.The MPA focuses on emerging public policy, a review of the current business environment and relevant regulations, as well as a vision to industrialise for the benefit of Kenya&rsquo;s economy.
