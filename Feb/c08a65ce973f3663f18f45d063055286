Refugees at the Dadaab camp yesterday celebrated the Thursday High Court ruling to suspend the planned closure of the camp.The sprawling Dadaab refugee camp is home to more than 350,000 people.Those who spoke to the Star said the manner in which the government was enforcing the closure of the camps was not good because security back home in Somalia was still fragile.Justice John Mativo on Thursday said Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery's May 10, 2016, directive to repatriate refugees and asylum seekers back to Somalia and close the camp was arbitrary.He directed the state to reinstate the Department of Refugees Affairs.Refugee Mariam Hassan yesterday said, &ldquo;We can now breathe. It is a sign or relief for us and hope that when the right time comes we will voluntarily go back home without being forced.&rdquo;Hassan, from Dagahaley, said the ruling will give newly elected Somalia President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, alias Farmajo, ample time to improve security and living conditions in the country.Refugee Abdi Mohamed from Ifo 2 camp said they have been receiving reports from those who had gone back home that the environment is not rosy, creating panic among those still in the camps.&ldquo;Majority of us were in a panic mode, not knowing what awaited us back home. The court ruling is welcome and we thank the judge who delivered it,&rdquo; he said.Government spokesman Eric Kiraithe said that while Kenya respects the rule of law, it will appeal against the directive.He said the decision to close the camp is "irreversible".
