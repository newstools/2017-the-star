The Senate committee report recommending prosecution of eight governors for corruption was engineered by greedy senators &ldquo;salivating for our seats&rdquo;, Nyandarua Governor Daniel Waithaka has said.&ldquo;That report was authored by people who well understand that this is campaign period so that they can grab our seats as we defend ourselves in court,&rdquo; he saidWaithaka criticised the Senate Public Accounts and Investments Committee for making the recommendation. &ldquo;For your information, the Senate has no mandate to take me to court. But the EACC can. That I accept,&rdquo; he said.Waithaka spoke on Friday at Ol Kalou during the groundbreaking ceremony for the Sh500 million county headquarters. Leaders who accompanied Waithaka defended him against the corruption claim. Shamata MCA John Gachari accused Senator Muriuki Karue of fighting Waithaka. &ldquo;Instead of fighting for Nyandarua, those we elected to [the] Senate are fighting us. Everyday he uses the media to portray us as very bad people,&rdquo; he saidBut Karue insisted Waithaka must be held responsible for corruption. &ldquo;We are in consensus that whoever has eaten be called to account,&rdquo; he said&ldquo;If you are in charge and claim you have not stolen, show us who did.&rdquo;
