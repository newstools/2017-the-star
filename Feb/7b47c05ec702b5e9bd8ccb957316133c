Aspirants who are eying various positions on a Jubilee Party ticket but with pending court cases over alleged corruption, tax evasion, assault, rape, forgery and hate speech could be locked out of the party nominations.It has been a practice that political parties only conduct party primaries without carrying due diligence on the candidates which has lead to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission locking out party nominees who are latter found to be unfit.President Uhuru Kenyatta's defunct The National Alliance party suffered a big blow in 2013 general elections after IEBC locked out Kajiado county governorship aspirant Taraiyia ole Kores.Kores had won the TNA ticket but the commission knocked him out of the race due to questionable academic papers, will be in charge of the troubled Kenya Meat Commission.The party had no more chance to replace Kores.It is constitutionally a must for aspirants for governor ,deputy governor ,the President and his deputy to have a degree qualification.Yesterday JP head of Secretariat Raphael Tuju confirmed that they will seek the services of Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission and the Commission on University Education over enforcement of the leadership and integrity code and to verify authenticity of education papers."As a party we have decided to seek the services of the commissions do do for us due diligence. In the last election we suffered a blow after some of our candidates were locked out at the last stage which was difficult for us to get a replacement," Tuju told the Star.More than 25 prominent politicians, and probably quite a few others, have court cases and the commission could be in a fix, less than nine months to the polls. Aspirants are keen to get a clean bill of ethical health.The law requires all politicians and aspirants to have their integrity vetted by the Ethics and Ant-Corruption Commission to ensure they comply with Chapter Six of the Constitution.It didn't happen in 2013 &mdash; they were allowed to run, despite court cases and dubious integrity.This time vetting is to ensure that if not squeaky clean, at least they are not in the dock.The commission issues compliance certificate to successful applicants who present it to the electoral commission for clearance.The EACC says sit will be diligent in scrutinising governors, MPs and MCAs to ensure strict compliance with the law before they can seek reelection.Also to be vetted are civil servants hoping to enter politics. The aim is to rid the race of individuals who might have pilfered public funds while in office.Nominated senator Beatrice Elachi said the move will ensure JP party get the right candidates who will not be challenged after being sworn in."this is a right move and we will work to ensure that it is implemented. Our candaites should not suffere after elections when they are challenged in court," she said.
