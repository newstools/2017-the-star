Limuru MP John Kiragu (pictured) has accused aspirants, whom he did not name, of disrespecting President Uhuru Kenyatta by inciting residents to protest because roads have been neglected. He on Tuesday called them wolves in sheep&rsquo;s clothing, saying they are using residents to show the country Uhuru has neglected his backyard. Kiragu urged residents to be wary of such politicians.
