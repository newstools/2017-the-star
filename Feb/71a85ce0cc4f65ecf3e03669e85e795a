Stanbic Bank will redeploy and retrain staff affected by the ongoing digitisation of operations, chief executive Philip Odera said on Friday.Kenya&rsquo;s eighth largest lender by market share reassured it will not retrench its employees.A number of banks have or are in the process of laying off workers in favour of digital platforms to enhance operational efficiency.The adoption of technology-driven channels is expected to protect profit margins as lenders adapt to controlled interest regime following the enforcement of the Banking (Amendment) Act 2016 last September. The result has been redundancies. &ldquo;The use of technology should assist you; it should not be something that should disable you. To the extent that it has any impact to any of our staff, what we will be seeking to do is redeploy them in other areas,&rdquo; Odera said.&ldquo;Our first point is to see where can we redeploy our staff and what else can they be doing? We have full intention of redeploying our staff to all the other areas rather than move one lot out and go back to the market and try to get another.&rdquo;Some of the banks that intend to send staff home include Equity Group (about 400 employees through natural attrition), KCB (undisclosed), Standard Chartered Bank {about 300}, Sidian Bank {108}, First Community {105}, Family Bank (undisclosed) and National Bank (undisclosed). Odera spoke after Stanbic Holdings, the bank&rsquo;s umbrella company, announced a 9.98 per cent drop in full-year net profit for the period ended December 31 on increased provisions against bad debt.The mid-tier lender&rsquo;s post-tax profit declined for the second year running to Sh4.42 billion from Sh4.91 billion in December 2015.Stanbic&rsquo;s loan book expanded by 10.11 per cent to Sh115.59 billion, helping grow net earnings from interest by 16.77 per cent to Sh10.86 billion. Net non-performing rose by Sh1.66 billion mainly in manufacturing, trade and agriculture sectors.Stanbic, owned 60 per cent by South Africa&rsquo;s Standard Bank Group, becomes the second major lender after Barclays to report reduced profit largely because of bad loans. Barclays net profit dropped 11.9 per cent to Sh7.4 billion.&ldquo;For the numbers from Barclays and Stanbic, we haven&rsquo;t seen any major surprises. Actually we have seen a few positives because these are banks that were traditionally trailing the market in balance sheet growth,&rdquo; head of research at Standard Investment Bank Francis Mwangi said.&ldquo;They have actually performed better than we expected and possibly better than the larger banks will perform.&rdquo;Stanbic has slashed proposed dividend payout by 14.63 per cent to Sh5.25 from Sh6.15 per share.Customer deposits increased 12.31 per cent to Sh119.33 billion, but transactional fees and commissions were flat, rising 0.26 per cent to Sh7.66 billion.
