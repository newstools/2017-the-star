Kisumu Senator Anyang Nyong&rsquo;o and Governor Jack Ranguma have differed over the appointment of Ojwang&rsquo; Lusi as the acting county secretary and head of the Public Service Board. Nyong&rsquo;o, who wants to unseat Ranguma, said Kisumu is bigger and should not only be a Kano clan affair. Both Ranguma and Lusi are from Kobura, a subclan of Kano.
