The August 8 presidential poll will be a two-horse race between Nasa and Jubilee, Bungoma Governor Kenneth Lusaka has said.The county boss said on Monday that the rest of the competitors "are merely donkeys that are escorting others"."We will have two horses...those lying to you that they will win the presidency are fantasising," Lusaka said."Any leader claiming he is going to State House through a party other than Nasa and Jubilee is lying to Wananchi."He addressed parents of Nabigenge secondary school, Tongaren constituency, where a library and two classrooms built by Bungoma woman representative Reginalda Wanyonyi were opened.Lusaka said politicians must understand that an election is not nuclear science, but mathematics which involves numbers.''You have to calculate to know if you are going to pass or not. This time round, many will be shocked," he said."Jubilee is more than ready to show Nasa dust in the coming polls. Nasa is still undecided on its flag bearer and is likely to split," he said.In possible reference to Senator Moses Wetang'ula, he said: "I saw another who lied that he would bring an elephant but has now decided to bring a rabbit.""Things have become tough for him. I saw it coming. He refused to take my advice thinking I am short and cannot see far," he added.The Governor said the 50,066 new Bungoma voters will be kept intact for Jubilee, citing development seen in the area since 2013."We want to plead with those who have registered to ensure they cast their ballot very early," he said.Read: Raila starts to close gap with Uhuru, poll showsAlso read: 41% say Raila can fight corruption, Uhuru still leads presidential race- IpsosLusaka's comments are likely to rub other parties, which are seeking to field candidates in the election, the wrong way.But he urged both Jubilee and Opposition leaders to ensure the poll is peaceful.The Governor also cautioned youths against getting too drunk to withstand long queues on voting day."This will keep good leaders from being elected and bad ones from being voted out," he said.He said he will work with Water CS Eugene Wamalwa, who was present, to ensure Jubilee's agenda is sold well in Western.Also read: Ruto likely to be President before Raila &mdash; Ipsos poll
