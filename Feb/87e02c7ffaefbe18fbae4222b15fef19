The Kilifi government plans to move to court next week for clarification on the legality of a bill signed into law by President Uhuru Kenyatta last year.In a scathing attack on the Jubilee administration, Governor Amason Kingi on Friday said the Land Laws (Amendment) Act 2016 violates the Constitution. He said the law has taken away the mandate of the counties on land matters, which primarily includes survey and mapping.&ldquo;The Jubilee government has never been our friends. They have been the biggest impediment to the development of the Coast. Last year, the President assented to the law, which says if we want to map or survey land in the counties we need to seek permission from the Cabinet Secretary in charge of Lands,&rdquo; Kingi said.&ldquo;This is against the Constitution we voted for overwhelmingly and that is why the county government will seek redress from next week.&rdquo; Kingi said the legislation is a recipe for chaos because people will be handed land ownership documents without following due process.&ldquo;They want to take us back to the days when people were given parcels of land in places they didn&rsquo;t even know and had to ask the provincial administration to locate the pieces,&rdquo; he said. Kingi renewed his criticism of the government, saying the President issued thousands of fake title deeds to the residents of the Coast.&ldquo;They came with the promise of ending land and historical injustices, made us wait in the sun for hours and at the end of the day the only thing they left us with were fake land ownership documents. What was the hurry for if they were not ready?&rdquo; Kingi said.
