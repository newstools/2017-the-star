Presidential aspirant Philip Murgor yesterday asked the electoral body to extend the window period for the ongoing mass voter registration exercise.The United Democratic Movement Presidential candidate said the period must be extended to enable Kenyans enjoy their constitutional right of voting.&ldquo;The government is systematically denying potential voters IDs in opposition strongholds so that they don&rsquo;t acquire voters&rsquo; cards in the next elections,&rdquo; said Murgor.Murgor also wants the national registration bureau to speed up the release of new national identification cards and reduce the time frame taken to issue the document after application.&ldquo;The President must give all Kenyans equal opportunities. On governance, he has failed to deliver on his promises after years in power and it would good if he allowed Kenyans to choose the right leaders,&rdquo; said Murgor.The mass voter registration exercise kicked off on the 16th of January and is set to come to an end on the 14th of February. According to provincial numbers released by Iebc for the last week, it's only 2 million new voters who have been registered against its projected target of 4 million new voters.&ldquo;I urge all Kenyans to register as voters to stop inflated projects meant to steal from Kenyans. They also take part in the process to build the nation and stop intimidation from Jubilee when they demand their rights,&rdquo; said Murgor.&ldquo;We want our country back on the development on the development agenda and stop targeting critics for any opposition,&rdquo; said Murgor.Murgor questioned the government on its commitment to fighting drug cartels and drug barons&ldquo;The government knows the people who are dealing in drugs and they should bring them to book instead of giving Kenyans lip service.He says if elected as the president, his government will not tolerate corruption and tribalism that have adversely affected the country&rsquo;s growth and development.He was speaking in Dandora estate Nairobi where he presided over a football tournament dubbed &ldquo;Tujisajili&rdquo; to help mobilize and encourage residents to register as voters.
