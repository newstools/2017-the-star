Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong has urged swift investigations into Friday's gun attack on ODM leader Raila Odinga in Turkana.About 15 armed gunmen stormed Raila's rally in Katile ward, Turkana East and started shooting.Raila was meeting ODM delegates, when the men started firing from the back, forcing the meeting to end abruptly. Raila escaped unhurt.Residents said the armed men started throwing stones before shooting.Ojaamong told politicians to respect each other.He spoke during the funeral of Simon Idewa, 90, in Kocholia village, Teso North subcounty, on Saturday.Various leaders have condemned the attack. Turkana Governor Josphat Nanok said the youths were incited.&ldquo;We have been told an MP incited youths to come to our meeting and disrupt it. We did not even have a chance to address the rally as stones were thrown at us,&rdquo; he said.On Saturday, nominated MP Oburu Oginga said the attack is a ploy by the Jubilee administration to assassinate him. &ldquo;The government has on several occasions tried to assassinate Raila and after we thwart their ploy by going public, they subject us to constant grilling and questioning by police,&rdquo; Oburu said.He said the laxity among security officials to arrest the youths who used guns to disrupt the meeting at Katilia shows who was behind it.Ojaamong also said the Jubilee administration does not deserve another term, citing rampant corruption and over-borrowing.
