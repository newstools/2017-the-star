Governor Evans Kidero has accused NLC chairman Muhammad Swazuri of colluding with land cartels to deny the Maasai community living in Dupotu-Darfur village, South C, Sh1.7 billion compensation.He said the community's 74 acres was acquired by the government for construction of the standard gauge railway but they yet to be compensated.Kidero said Swazuri included names of "strangers&rdquo; in the compensation list and left out the real owners of the land, forcing the county to seek court's intervention.&ldquo;MPs, some from outside Nairobi, have been coming to me, trying to convince me to withdraw the case so that they can get the money. But I told them I will not withdraw the case neither will I authorise any payments,&rdquo; he said.The governor, who visited the village on Wednesday, assured the community he will not allow outsiders to be paid at their expense.Village elder Simon Keteina told the gathering that Swazuri has discarded their allotment letters issued by City hall, terming them fake.&ldquo;He told us that the papers we had were fake. So I don't know who has a genuine license because this is our land and we have lived here for years,&rdquo; he said.
