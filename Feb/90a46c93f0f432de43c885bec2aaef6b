Gold and copper mines in Zambia and South Sudan, extensive investments in real estate and transport in Kenya, Sudan and Lebanon are part of what the Akasha empire allegedly includes.It now stands in limbo after the killings of family patriach Ibrahim Akasha in 2000 and his son Kamaldin two years later, and now the extradition of his two other sons Baktash and Ibrahim, over alleged drug trafficking.A street in Amsterdam&rsquo;s Red-light district where Ibrahim Akasha was gunned down on May 3, 2000. /COURTESYTRIAL WITH EL CHAPOBaktash and Ibrahim will be tried alongside the world&rsquo;s most wanted drug lords, among them Mexican Joaqu&iacute;n Guzm&aacute;n, alias El Chapo, who was extradited to the US to stand trial for drug trafficking charges.The Akasha brothers and Guzman were indicted on charges of conspiring to import tonnes of heroin, marijuana, cocaine and methamphetamine into the United States from Kenya and Mexico respectively.Prosecutors believe the cartel may have been the biggest supplier of cocaine to the New York City area for a decade or longer.The charges carry a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years in prison and a maximum sentence of life in prison.Stringent security measures were being put in place around the Manhattan jail, where the Akasha brothers, two foreigners and Guzman will be held throughout the trial.Guzman and other cartel leaders were indicted in 2009 in the US District Court in Brooklyn on charges of conspiring to import more than 264,000 pounds of cocaine into the United States between 1990 and 2005.Despite multiple requests by the United States for Mexico to extradite him, the elusive kingpin had never set foot in an American courtroom, not until he was handed over. He pleaded not guilty before New York Magistrate Court on January 10.ROGUES&rsquo; GALLERYAccording to The New York Times, the Akasha brothers, two foreigners and Guzman would join a rogues&rsquo; gallery of drug barons who have stood trial on American soil.Among them are Al Capone, convicted of tax evasion in Chicago in 1931; Gen Manuel Antonio Noriega, the former dictator of Panama, convicted on drug and racketeering charges in Miami in 1992; and James Bulger, known as Whitey, convicted of murder and racketeering in Boston in 2013.According to court records, the Akasha brothers are accused of conspiring to ship at least 98kg of high-grade heroin and methamphetamine to the US through Kenya.The two were bundled into a chartered plane on Monday night alongside Vicky Goswami (Indian) and Hussein Gulam (Pakistani) at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, bound for the US.Sources indicate the US was interested in the Akashas to help in building up Guzman&rsquo;s case, which involves a cartel accused of smuggling drugs from Colombian drug organisations to America.&ldquo;They are wanted to stand trial in the US District Court Eastern District of New York. They are the subject of indictment in which they are charged with conspiracy to import narcotics,&rdquo; charges against them indicate.According to Drug Enforcement Agents Special, the four are the most dangerous global drug traffickers, who pose a direct threat to safety and stability around the world.According to the UN, the global drug trade generates an estimated Sh32 trillion, with a world GDP of Sh3.6 quadrillion each year.A file photo of Baktash Akasha, Vijay Goswami, Hussein Shabakash and Ibrahim Abdalla at the High Court in Mombasa. /MKAMBURI MWAWASITRANSIT HUBKenya has become a drug distribution transit hub for Europe and Asian markets in recent years due to its extensive air links, vast Indian Ocean coastline and inadequate security patrol in the territorial waters, according to the UN and the US.President Uhuru Kenyatta on Tuesday singled out Mombasa as a leading drug hub, and vowed to ensure traffickers and peddlers are dealt with.In a recently released report, the US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) and the UN have cited corruption as among the key factors hindering the war on drugs in Kenya.Unlike in the Guzman case where a federal court in Mexico denied an appeal by his lawyers to block the extradition to New York, the Akashas had partly won a case barring authorities from handing them over, pursuant to a US request, based on charges filed in the Southern District of New York.Their lawyer Cliff Ombeta moved to court on Monday demanding the four be produced in court, accusing police of abducting his clients.The High Court in Mombasa subsequently summoned CID director Ndegwa Muhoro and Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet to explain the whereabouts of the four.Baktsha Akasha is branded as the leader of an organised crime family in Kenya responsible for the production and distribution of tonne quantities of narcotics in Kenya and throughout Africa.He was arrested by US DEA agents posing as Colombia dealers after Ibrahim delivered 98kg of heroin to Nairobi on behalf of the Akasha organisation. And a few days later, Ibrahim also delivered another kilogramme of methamphetamine.Goswami is accused of conspiring with the Akasha brothers to smuggle quantities of methamphetamine and heroin into the US.&ldquo;The four ran a Kenyan drug trafficking organisation with global ambitions. For their alleged distribution of tonnes of narcotics &ndash; heroin and methamphetamine &ndash; around the globe, including to America,&rdquo; read Manhattan US Attorney Preet Bharara&rsquo;s statement.&ldquo;Goswami heads a transportation network that distributes massive quantities of narcotics throughout the Middle East and Africa, and has acknowledged responsibility for transporting tonnes of kilograms of heroin by sea,&rdquo; the statement futher said.Baktash Akasha, Vijay Goswami, Hussein Shabakash and Ibrahim Abdalla arrive in the US after being extradited. /COURTESYCONTROVERSIAL HISTORYThe Akashas are not new to controversy. Almost 17 years ago (May 2000 ), their father Ibrahim Akasha was shot dead by a lone gunman in the red-light district of Amsterdam, Netherlands, after being lured by Indian fugitive Dawood Ibrahim. His assasination was alleged to be over a drug deal.Akasha was then being sought in connection with the seizure of several tonnes of hashish in Mombasa and had many times escaped the police dragnet.The Akasha empire that once enjoyed immense influence now seems disintegrated after the deaths and extraditions of its leader and his sons.A family confidant said they had solely depended on the now extradited Baktash, perceived successor of his late father, to help end property feuds between the brothers.&ldquo;He had taken the mantle to lead the family but it is unfortunate that he is no longer here. We are in a dilemma. Hopefully Allah will guide us,&rdquo; said a family member who requested anonymity.On Tuesday, Baktash&rsquo;s mother Fatuma wailed and broke down upon learning of their extradition to the US and pleaded to the government to intervene and have them tried in the country.&ldquo;My son has never traded in drugs in the US and why extradite them when the case is pending in Kenya? It is very unfortunate,&rdquo; she said.Sources indicate the US DEA and Kenya&rsquo;s anti-narcotics agencies will make high-profile arrests of individuals behind the drug trafficking syndicate.Drugs barons appear to have compromised security agents, political leaders and the business community in Kenya, the reports say.The Kenyan Anti-Narcotics Unit, led by Dr Hamisi Massa, says heroin and cocaine are trafficked into the country through the Indian Ocean, border points and the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi.CASE HISTORYThe move by the US to snatch away the Akashas and two foreigners might have been triggered by an impasse at the Mombasa law courts over witnesses and extradition.In November 2014, warrants of arrest were issued by a US court and the four were required to answer a narcotics importation conspiracy charge.They were accused of smuggling heroin worth Sh1 billion into the country in 2014.In June 2015, the four wanted the case dismissed. They said Kenya and the US had no binding laws extradition.On December 1, 2015, chief magistrate Maxwell Gicheru released them on Sh5 million bond, which was later reviewed by High Court judge Martin Muya to Sh30 million.The four have on various occassions denied being fugitives and asked the court to try them in the Kenyan courts. Recently, the four for the second time, raised issues of the court&rsquo;s jurisdiction in relation to the extradition proceedings. Through lawyer Timothy Bryant, they told the court they are not fugitives as per the definition in a treaty signed between Kenya and the US.Bryant told the court a fugitive is one who commits a crime in one country and flees to another.&ldquo;It is clear our clients are not fugitives. They have been in the country for the longest time and were arrested in the country and not in the US,&rdquo; he said.Bryant further added that the DPP should prove to the court the respondents had committed a crime in the US and fled to Kenya. He urged the court to quash the trial, saying there is no law allowing it to conduct such proceedings.Ibrahim Akasha's widow Fatuma breaks down while following proceedings of ther son's case at Mombasa law courts. / MKAMBURI MWAWASIEarlier in December 2016, the state suffered two setbacks in their bid to extradite the four respondents to the US.A chief magistrate&rsquo;s court ruled that the state has to produce live witnesses, which the Director of Public Prosecutions is reluctant to do.Assistant DPP Alexander Muteti told the court on two occasions they will not need live witnesses. He said he closed his case and will not call live witnesses.Chief magistrate Julius Nang&rsquo;ea said the proceedings will not continue without the eight witnesses mentioned in the affidavits produced by the US prosecutors.On December 1, Muteti told the court they will use an affidavit sworn by officers from the US. Copies of the arrest warrants in the Southern District of New York were attached to an application by Muteti.Defence lawyers Cliff Ombeta and Kirathe Wandugi had made an application for the state to produce all the witnesses who had sworn the affidavit.Among those who were to be cross-examined are American chief investigator Michael Lockhard, New York prosecutor Mathew Kellow and six confidential sources.Ombeta said since the DPP has already closed their case. It will be their chance to cross-examine the witnesses.Justice Dorah Chepkwony said the court has the discretion to change any orders given by another court.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s illegal for the High Court to intervene and discharge its own orders. I therefore grant the orders sought by the respondents,&rdquo; she said.Chepkwony also allowed the respondents to move around the country once they inform the authorities, unlike before, when they were not allowed to move outside Mombasa.The court said it has been one and a half years since the respondents were released on bond and have adhered to the conditions given.They were also ordered to report to the police twice every month.However, in a dramatic turn of events, Ibrahim, Goswani and Gulam were arrested by anti-narcotics police officers at the Akashas&rsquo; home in Nyali on Saturday evening while Baktash was seized from a house in Mombasa the next day.They now await their fate before a US Federal Court.
