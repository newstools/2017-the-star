President Uhuru Kenyatta yesterday created the Nairobi Metropolitan Area Transport Authority to address transport challenges facing Nairobi, Kiambu, Kajiado, Machakos and Murang&rsquo;a counties.He said NAMATA will provide a comprehensive and dynamic platform for addressing the decades-old challenges in the transport sector, which has created transport and business operation challenges within the metropolitan area.The metropolitan area is made up of the five counties.&ldquo;The Authority is a consequence of various presidential interventions and directives issued since 2013 that are geared towards positively redefining our nation&rsquo;s capital as well as the wider metropolitan area that encompasses four other counties,&rdquo; Uhuru said in a press statement.He said the Authority will formulate sustainable integrated public transport strategy based on the development of a sustainable urban mobility plan to orderly and structured development of the proposed metropolitan area mass transit system.The system will incorporate bus rapid transit and commuter rail.&ldquo;These elements are part of the administration&rsquo;s wider plan of improving Kenya&rsquo;s transport infrastructure as a spur for social and economic development,&rdquo; Uhuru said.The establishment of the authority is based on the MoU signed in August 2013 between the national government, through the Transport ministry on one part, and Nairobi, Kiambu, Murang&rsquo;a, Machakos and Kajiado counties on the other part.&ldquo;The Metropolitan Area has experienced rapid growth over the last three decades but there has not been commensurate focus on providing sufficient and sustainable transport options for the area&rsquo;s visitors and residents,&rdquo; said Uhuru.The President expects NAMATA to address the gap and provide the Metropolitan Area with a world-class public transport system. The Authority, as established by the Head of State&rsquo;s Executive Order, is an interim measure pending the enactment of a Statute that will establish a fully-fledged Authority with expanded powers and a broader mandate.
