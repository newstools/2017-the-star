Three people were killed, tens injured and more than 100 others arrested in a land dispute in Athi River town on Friday.Two rival groups clashed on the piece of land said to belong to East African Portland Cement Company, opposite Green Park Gardens along Mombasa Road.Some of those involved in the fight hurled stones at vehicles plying the route.Police said one of the groups was of hooligans ferried from Eastlands to create chaos.Maurice Ndeti, chairman of the controversial land boundaries committee, said a group of more than 250 men were transported to the property early in the morning.He said they arrived in four buses which were parked at a Mlolongo hotel while the fighting took place.Ndeti reported that the hooligans demolished more than 50 houses constructed on the land by locals.He claimed they were members of an outlawed criminal gang from central Kenya, who were hired by an individual to evict them from the land.They were armed with bows, arrows, guns and other crude weapons, said the chairman."We peacefully divided the land among 16 society groups in the Kamba community. These people are invaders since they do not belong to any of the groups," he said.He noted this was the fourth such attack.Read: Two killed during clashes over EAPCC landAthi River deputy county commissioner Geoffrey Omoding' confirmed the number of people killed.
