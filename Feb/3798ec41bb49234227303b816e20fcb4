Former players Godfrey Wagachunga and Dennis Owaka have been appointed joint Butali Sugar Warriors&rsquo; coaches ahead of the 2017 Kenya Hockey Union Premier League.The two take charge of the former local champions after team coach Cliffe Okello passed on last month after short illness. Butali team manager, Kamal Sembi, confirmed the two have been appointed to take charge of the team. Sembi, who also played for the then Kisumu Simba now Butali, observed that the two have been with the team for over two decades and are in a better position to handle it.He said: &ldquo;We are not shopping for a coach. The two (Wagachunga and Owaka) worked under the Singapore-based Dutch consultant Coen Van Putten during the last month&rsquo;s Africa Cup of Club Championship in Nairobi and have what it takes to guide the team. It works easy when you get a former player to guide a team they once played for and I am happy the two have agreed to take up the role.&rdquo;Sembi, however, noted that they will still borrow and consult with the Putten, who helped Butali win bronze medal on their debut during the club championship which saw Eastern Company of Egypt retain the title with Kenya Police settling for silver.&ldquo;Like any other team, our objective is to win the title. We are keen to reclaim the title we lost to Strathmore and we are going to use the program given to us by Putten as we consult with him going forward,&rdquo; noted the official.The official also re-affirmed the club will retain the services of Dutch players Hattum Jannis (midfielder) and Joost Rijksen (forward), alongside and Pakistani goalkeeper Salman Akbar. The players were signed by Butali during the recent club championship.&ldquo;The three players were outstanding during the club championship and we are happy they will be part of the team this season. Besides the trio, we have also acquired the services of Mvita goalkeeper Pius Ratori,&rdquo; he added. The official said they are supporting the unified league format as opposed to pooling system which was used last season.
