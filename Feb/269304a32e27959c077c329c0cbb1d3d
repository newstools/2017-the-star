Kisii Governor James Ongwae has said he will not sign the Bill giving all retired governors Sh10 million golden handshakes and a monthly allowance of Sh500,000 for life.It also gives hefty rewards to a raft of civil servants and their families.The Bill has caused outrage.The Kisii County Retirements Benefits (Governor and Designated officers) Bill 2016 was passed by MCAs last Thursday.Speaking to a vernacular radio station on the phone, Ongwae assured residents he will study the Bill and consider its merits. &ldquo;I am normal so I will not assent to the Bill because it was passed. I have to look at it keenly,&rdquo; he said.But a statement from Ongwae&rsquo;s office said a joint committee proposed that the county seek expert advice from the Retirement Benefits Authority, the Salaries and Remuneration Commission and the Controller of Budget once the Bill becomes an Act.The Bill was introduced by a private member and was not prepared by the executive. &ldquo;You cannot stop MCAs from debating any Bill in the assembly but the same can be assented to if it has merit,&rdquo; Ongwae said.The Committee on Culture, Sports and Community Social Services and Budget chaired by Chitago-Borabu MCA Albert Oino reviewed the bill before it was tabledAsked by the radio presenter why he saw it necessary to table the motion, Oino said the Bill protects retired officers from a miserable future.Former councillors had petitioned for a law awarding them pensions, but the MCAs included themselves, governors, deputy governors, speakers and their spouses. Bosoti-Sengera MCA aspirant Richard Onsongo yesterday said he will sue Ongwae if he signs the bill. He said it will be an intolerable burden to the taxpayer.
