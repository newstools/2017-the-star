It was never a Kenyan candidature,&rdquo; he told the Star by phone on Wednesday.The MP criticised the President for "blowing billions of taxpayers' money" in a whirlwind of continental trips to drum up support for the failed "personal project".&ldquo;Given the heavy investment by the state and the embarrassing outcome, the investment was not worthwhile,&rdquo; he said.The government reached 51 out of 54 African Union member states and spent hundreds of millions of shillings travelling across the continent to lobby leaders to vote for Amina.The effort had not been factored into the current financial year.Kenya also chartered a private plane for Deputy President William Ruto&rsquo;s pan-African campaign for Amina in a move reminiscent of the Sh100 million &ldquo;Hustler Jet&rdquo; scandal of 2013.National Assembly Majority leader Aden Duale said the President's delegation did not regret the amount of money spent lobbying for Amina's candidature.Read more: Duale now accuses Kofi Annan of manipulating AU electionsBosire said Kenya could have done better had Uhuru not personalised Amina&rsquo;s candidature.&ldquo;Some countries were definitely uncomfortable with a chair working at whims of a partisan President perpetuating impunity,&rdquo; he said.The MP said Uhuru's leadership has lost touch not only with Kenya but also with the content due to its poor show in matters diplomacy and the fight against graft."We can't expect miracles from Jubilee in the remaining six months. Uhuru has failed and should be prepared to go home in August 8," he said.Read: Uganda assures Kenya of support, says it backed Amina in AU electionAlso read: Amina and Juma power tussle as reality of AU job loss sinks inPresidential hopeful Kennedy Mong'are wants kenya to come up with a policy on legal foreign status to guide its engagements at the global stage."It was naive for Kenya to present a candidate who did not enjoy global support," said the Nyamira Senator.
