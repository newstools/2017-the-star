But I wish political parties would carry out their primaries without involving us&hellip;but we have to abide by the rule of law and that is why we will have that meeting to clear the grey issues,&rdquo; Chebukati said.More on this: Party primaries slotted for April as IEBC reviews timelines ahead of pollsRead: IEBC must not conduct party primaries, KNCHR tells Senate
