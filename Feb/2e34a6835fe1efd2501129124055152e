Petroleum and gas products distributor, Total Kenya, is offering customers a discount of between eight and nine per cent on purchase of its range of solar lanterns as part of Valentine&rsquo;s promotion. &ldquo;With nearly half of Kenya&rsquo;s households not connected to the electricity grid and depending on alternative sources of lighting, our range of lanterns fill this void with cleaner and environmentally friendly renewable energy without any running costs,&rdquo; Total Kenya marketing manager Alban Tarneaud said. The campaign runs up to February 28 providing customers with durable lighting solutions as the Total solar products last between four hours and 100 hours.
