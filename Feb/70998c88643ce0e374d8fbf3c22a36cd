A dispute between two factions of a family over land in Kinangop, Nyandarua county, ended in tragedy when a 43-year-old man was hacked to death and his elder brother, 53, seriously injured.Four attackers razed the rival family&rsquo;s house and fled. The land was left behind by their parents.Residents said the family has fought over the land for more than 10 years.Local leader Jeremiah Mwai said the attackers used pangas. &ldquo;They cornered the two men as they tilled the disputed land,&rdquo; he said.Mwai said the attackers threatened to strike again &ldquo;to deal with the others&rdquo;.&ldquo;We know the family has fought for years, but we were shocked when they turned against each other,&rdquo; he said.A senior police officer from Engineer police station confirmed the incident, adding that investigations are underway. No arrests have been made. &ldquo;We have the names of all those linked to the attack and we are searching for them so they can record statements,&rdquo; he said.Elsewhere in Naivasha, a traffic officer escaped death narrowly after a motorist arrested for breaking traffic rules jumped out of the moving car leaving the policeman trapped inside.The car veered off the road, almost hitting pedestrians, before landing in a drainage tunnel near Milimani Primary School. Passers-by rescued the officer, who was not injured. The wreckage was towed to Naivasha police station.Resident John Kimani said many motorists have been arrested for breaking traffic laws in recent weeks.Early last year, the National Transport and Safety Authority received more than 40 vehicles and five ambulances, equipped with gadgets and systems to monitor motorists. Transport CS James Macharia said the vehicles will be permanently placed on most highways as the ambulances are deployed in areas marked as black spots. He said the vehicles have speed guns and breathalysers which will be used to identify drunk motorists.&ldquo;NTSA vehicles have been fitted with speed guns, breathalysers and a system to detect fake documents, including driving licences, inspection stickers,&rdquo; Macharia said.
