The court will on Monday, January 27, rule on whether or not civil servants eyeing elective seats should resign six months before the polls.Some former government officials tendered their resignations earlier to meet the February 7 deadline set by the election law. However, the Employment and Labour Relations Court in Kericho barred the electoral commission from disqualifying public servants seeking elective seats who had not resigned by the set date until the case challenging the implementation of the law is determined.Read:Civil servants quit to run for MP, MCA posts in August electionKericho Labour Court Judge Njagi Marete was scheduled to make the ruling last week but pushed it to tomorrow (Monday).The case was filled by a resident in Kericho who is challenging the constitutionality of electoral laws.Marete dismissed an application by lawyers representing the Public Service Commission, Attorney General Githu Muigai and head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua that his court did not have the jurisdiction to listen to the matter. State Counsels, Charles Mutinda and Janet Langat, who were acting on behalf of the three government agencies told the court that the Labour Court lacked jurisdiction to hear the petition filed on January 16 by Eric Cheruiyot. &ldquo;I find that this court has jurisdiction over the matter by the virtue of the provisions of Articles 22 and 23 which empower this court to deal with matters attacking fundamental rights,&rdquo; said Marete. The Judge directed Cheruiyot&rsquo;s Counsel Simiyu Murambi to file his written submissions and serve all the respondents within eight days and directed the respondents to file written responses before court within four days of receipt of the submissions.Read:Civil servants eyeing political positions to resign by FebruaryMutinda argued that Article 165 (3) (d) gave only the High Court the jurisdiction to hear cases involving interpretation of sections of the Constitution and determine whether or not they contravene or are in conflict with the spirit of the Supreme law. But Simiyu Murambi , who represents Cheruiyot in the matter, said the law had granted every Kenyans the right to move to court and file a petition if they felt that any part of the Constitution contravened their rights or the rights of others. &ldquo;The Constitution in Article 22 (1) states very clearly that every person has a right to institute court proceedings against any law interfering with fundamental freedom in the Bills of Rights.,&rdquo; said Murambi. Murambi had requested for 14 days to file submissions, saying he needed adequate time to research on the issue so that he could table more evidence backing the case.He dismissed arguments by IEBC lawyer Ronald Kibet that an extension of time would be detrimental to the preparations of the General Election by the IEBC. &ldquo;This matter does not relate to a procurement function and so the argument by my learned friend cannot be true. There is no demonstrable prejudice that an additional seven days for the petitioner to do research on this matter would occasion on the IEBC,&rdquo; argued Murambi. But Kibet, who was supported by Muigai&rsquo;s counsel Janet Langat, shot back, saying the case was a &ldquo;weighty matter&rdquo; adding that seven days would be more than enough for the petitioner to file submissions and serve all the respondents. The IEBC lawyer further argued that the orders barring the IEBC from disqualifying public servants who have not resigned from office from pursuing elective office had had a major effect on the operations of the electoral body and urged the court to rule on the issue as soon as possible. &ldquo;The orders in place have an impact on how my client will conduct its constitutional duty to conduct free and fair polls. The civil servants, who the orders protect, will continue being in office to the detriment of the general public,&rdquo; argued Kibet.Read:Two CSs, top civil servants to quit and run for seatsJustice Marete agreed with him on the timelines, noting that even though his court was determined to dispense of the matter in a fair manner and grant each party enough time to prepare its arguments, it had no luxury of time. Eric Cheruiyot, a resident of Kipkelion Constituency, filed the petition in court on January 16 claiming that the law requiring a section of public servants to resign from their jobs six months to the General Election was discriminatory in nature.He said the law had given undue advantage to governors, Senators, Members of Parliament and Members of County Assembly (MCAs) by allowing them to stay in office and draw salaries while demanding that the other public servants resign from their jobs. In his petition, Cheruiyot accused the IEBC, PSC, Attorney General and Head of Public Service of contravening the Constitution of Kenya 2010 and sought an order declaring that Sections 43 (5) and (6) of the Elections Act of 2011 unconstitutional because they were discriminatory.
