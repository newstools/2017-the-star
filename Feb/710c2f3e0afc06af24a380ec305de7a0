The main responsibility of any elected government is to protect the lives and property of the people. And this protection needs to be swift, robust and uncompromising.However, after the recent launch of new police equipment and vehicles &ndash; including armoured personnel carriers &ndash; the government has mostly looked on as armed bandits have descended on settled communities in parts of the North Rift, Eastern and elsewhere.Politicians are taking advantage of the drought to uproot people in certain zones ahead of the general election. Bandits embedded in large groups of armed herders cannot all be engaged in a search for pasture and water, however desperate the situation. Why invade and kill?When marauders displace populations, the government&rsquo;s response should be massive and swiftly effective. In parts of Baringo, schools have been converted into IDP camps.There are parts of the country the Red Cross has withdrawn its personnel from, citing no guarantees of security.The government must attend to this unacceptable state of affairs at once.
