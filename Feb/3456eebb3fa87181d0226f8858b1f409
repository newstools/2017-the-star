The Busia government does not discriminate against any cadre of health workers, Governor Sospeter Ojaamong has said. &ldquo;We are ready to pay other cadres of health workers who are not in the nurses or doctors&rsquo; unions,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We are determined to ensure improved working environment, infrastructure and human resource, equal chances in employment, career development, representation in administration and policymaking&rdquo;Ojaamong spoke on Monday night during an interview with TV Magharibi in Bungoma. He said his government is aware of the plight of 17 cadres of health workers, including clinical and public health officers. &ldquo;It is not true the workers who are under the umbrella of the Kenya Health Professional Society demonstrated in the streets of Busia town. The workers came to present their memorandum to me,&rdquo; he said.
