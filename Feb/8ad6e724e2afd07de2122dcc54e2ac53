The final national mass registration of voters ahead of the 12th General Election ended yesterday. The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission will now move on to update the Voter&rsquo;s Roll.During the mass registration, a number of controversial allegations were made &mdash; about double registration, identity theft and illegal registration in Eastleigh and Runda, Nairobi. The IEBC needs to ensure it resolves these issues and the Voter&rsquo;s Roll is thoroughly cleaned up so that, by inspection time sometime in May, they present to Kenyans a document that can stand scrutiny and generate confidence in the process on all sides of the political divide. In 2013, and the IEBC confirmed this in court, the commission appeared to have different facets of the Voter&rsquo;s Roll, instead of one definitive document. The opposition even went so far as to claim there were more than two versions of the Roll. The IEBC needs to present a Roll whose integrity matches that of databases such as Safaricom Mpesa&rsquo;s platform. Nothing less will do.
