Kenya Power has shelved interim dividend payment as it continues to invest in connecting new customers and improving electricity supply.The company said in a financial statement on Friday it will not pay the dividend, despite an 11.7 per cent growth in profit for six months through December. The near-monopoly electricity producer&rsquo;s profit in the review period rose to Sh4.2 billion from Sh3.76 billion previously on increased power sales.Kenya Power, controlled 51 per cent by the state, paid Sh0.20 dividend per share for half-year period in the previous financial year.&ldquo;The company is focused on the implementation of key capital projects to ensure reliable power supply top our customers and connect new customers, generating higher sales that will improve the top line,&rdquo; acting managing director Ken Tarus said in a statement. &ldquo;These efforts will leverage on the strategic approach that focuses on meeting growing demand for power, through expansion and continual upgrade of the distribution network.&rdquo;The company last November said capital expenditure for this financial year to June 30 will fall 16 per cent to Sh42 billion from Sh50 billion the year before.Kenya Power&rsquo;s profit before taxation in six months to December 2016, however, declined by a marginal 1.74 per cent to Sh5.64 billion from Sh5.74 billion previously.&ldquo;This decrease is attributed to a decline in finance income (usually not part of taxable income) by Sh723 million as a result of reduced bank balances,&rdquo; Tarus said.Income from electricity sales rose 9.91 per cent to Sh45.80 billion from Sh41.67 billion a year earlier, boosted by more than 800, 000 new customers who were connected to the grid in the six-month period. The company said it is inching closer to meeting the 70 per cent connectivity target by end of the year.&ldquo;We are focused on advancing the country&rsquo;s socio-economic agenda by ensuring all Kenyans enjoy the full benefits associated with access to electricity,&rdquo; Tarus said. &ldquo;The connectivity is expected to accelerate economic growth at the micro-economic level and improve quality of lives.&rdquo;Operating costs increased by 5.17 per cent to Sh51.65 billion after it spent 4.65 per cent more to Sh26.11 billion to pay power generators, while transmission costs rose 23.64 per cent to Sh16.16 billion on expansion and maintenance of the supply network.The restructuring of Kenya Power&rsquo;s balance sheet resulted in a 13.16 per cent reduction in finance cost to Sh2.58 billion year-on-year in the six months.
