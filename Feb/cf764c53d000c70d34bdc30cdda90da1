Kenya plans to target a fiscal deficit of 7.0 per cent of GDP in its financial year starting in July, down from 9.6 per cent of GDP this fiscal year, the Treasury said in a draft budget.The draft, seen by Reuters on Friday, projects the deficit at Sh582.5 billion, down from an estimated Sh716.9 billion this fiscal year.The National Treasury said the deficit would be covered by Sh206.0 billion in net external borrowing while the rest will come from domestic borrowing.The government was committed to lowering the fiscal deficit to 5.2 per cent of GDP in the 2018/19 fiscal year and 4.0 per cent in the medium term, the Finance Ministry said."This reduction will strengthen our debt sustainability position," the ministry said, adding economic growth was expected at 5.9 per cent this year from an estimated 6.0 per cent last year.Financial markets participants and the opposition have criticised the government of President Uhuru Kenyatta for raising borrowing in the last four years to spend on a range of infrastructure projects such as the SGR and roads.Uhuru is running for a second and final five-year term in an election set for August 8. He is widely expected to face his main rival Raila Odinga, although a united opposition, bringing together the main parties, has not yet said who will challenge Kenyatta.Lawmakers are expected to peruse the draft budget in the next few weeks, before the finance minister presents the final budget, which will include any changes brought by parliamentarians and agreed upon by the Treasury.The budget is usually unveiled in mid-June but the August vote has brought it forward.
