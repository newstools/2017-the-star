Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana&rsquo;s Muungano Party and Kalonzo Musyoka&rsquo;s Wiper yesterday signed an agreement to work together.However, Kibwana will run for reelection and Muungano will not be dissolved.&ldquo;We will table the documents to the National Governing Council in Wiper for ratification and that is where issues of direct nomination will be discussed,&rdquo; Kalonzo said.Muungano supporters had earlier said they have no problem with Kibwana working with Wiper, on condition that he will be given a direct nomination.The pact was signed at Ngwata Technical Institute in Kibwezi East.Kibwana has been under immense pressure from Kalonzo and other leaders to ditch Muungano and join Wiper to strengthen the party and give it negotiating power in NASA.
