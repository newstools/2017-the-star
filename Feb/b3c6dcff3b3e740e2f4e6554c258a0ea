Bunyala residents have appealed to the President (pictured) to order the remapping of the Lake Victoria Ring Road. Led by resident Pius Obara, they said the consultancy firm hired to draw the map of the World Bank-funded road left out a large part of Busia. Obara said, &ldquo;We want Bunyala to be a tourism circuit so the road should extend all the way to Mau Mau market and beyond.&rdquo;
