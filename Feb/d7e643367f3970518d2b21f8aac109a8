President Uhuru Kenyatta has given former Cabinet minister Marsden Madoka a second parastatal job, making him among the biggest beneficiaries from the Coast.Uhuru named Madoka, a former MP for Wundanyi, the new trustee of the National Fund for the Disabled of Kenya.Madoka is still the Kenya Ports Authority chairman and former chair of the Kenya Revenue Authority.In the latest Kenya Gazette, Madoka&rsquo;s appointment was backdated by the Head of State to December 23, 2016.&ldquo;I, Uhuru Kenyatta, President of the Republic of Kenya, and Commander-in-Chief of the Kenya Defence Forces, appoint Major (Rtd) Marsden Madoka to be a Trustee of the National Fund for the Disabled of Kenya, with effect from 23rd December 2016,&rdquo; the Kenya Gazette Notice reads. Before Madoka left KRA, questions had been raised over the two positions he held. At the time there were accusations the government had violated Mwongozo &mdash; its own Code of Governance for State Corporations &mdash;that prohibits multiple directorships.&ldquo;A chairperson of an SC shall not hold such position concurrently, to allow them to devote sufficient time to steering the board,&rdquo; the code launched in 2015, states. In 2015, Madoka strongly defended Uhuru&rsquo;s appointments of the old guard, saying senior citizens have &ldquo;rare wisdom and experience&rdquo;.
