Twitter had been abuzz with the #BeyondZeroBoycott hashtag as many criticised the First Lady for holding the marathon amid the health crisis.Many interpreted the cancellation as a show of power of social media activism.Wandia Njoya tweeted: "#BeyondZero I praise all the ordinary Kenyans who used 140 characters to speak out about the marathon, and got told they're haters."Magunga said, "... never ever tell me social media activism is useless. #BeyondZero."But others criticised the First Lady's statement for failing to address the doctor's strike, now in its 62nd day."No enlightened Kenyan would run the #BeyondZero marathon. The whole stunt is a mockery to our public healthcare sytem! #BoycottBeyondZero," Elijah Tei Matolo said.The Northerner asked, "Has the @FirstLadyKenya and her Zero thing ever read #MyBadDoctorExperience? If she did she'd run for the doctors."In her statement, the First Lady said she has been looking forward to running yet another marathon - a Gratitude Marathon."However, I have never been willing to politicise this agenda. As a consequence I feel it necessary to cancel the First Lady&rsquo;s Half Marathon this year."
