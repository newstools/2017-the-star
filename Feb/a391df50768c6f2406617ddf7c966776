Siaya county leaders have defended Raila Odinga against claims that he demanded a bribe from Dominion CEO Clavin Burgess.Burgess accused the opposition leader of demanding money to fund his campaigns for the 2007 general elections.He also claimed Raila frustrated plans to reclaim and resettle residents of Siaya in the Yala swamp after he sought to gain political support from the businessman which he denied him.But Governor Cornel Rasanga dismissed the allegations as 'ridiculous', saying Burgess is tainting Raila's name."That is tainting Raila especially now that we are in campaign mode and Raila is the man to beat in the August 8 polls," Rasanga said on Thursday.Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo said it was unfortunate that the CEO is depicting Raila as a corrupt leader."Burgess must go with immediate effect and he should have left yesterday. He is a conman. We need to know how he left Ghana. We don't need him in Kenya," he told the Star on phone.Read: Dominion under fire as Siaya talks held todayThe MP added that if the Dominion investor is not out before the end of this month, he is going to deal with him using the public."What he has brought to Siaya, a population of 1.7 million, is only 5,000 employed residents, premature birth and chemicals everywhere, prompting residents to not even keep animals," Midiwo said.He said the Dominion boss was called for a public petition and he had never faced Parliament to address issues affecting residents living near the firm.Read: Four Siaya MCAs arrested over protests at Dominion CompanyAlso read: Siaya MP wants Dominion land lease reviewedMidiwo said Burgess is being used by the Jubilee administration to tarnish Raila's name.He accused Dominion of failing to pay taxes and for getting their contract by bribing former Siaya councillors.Bondo MP Gideon Ochanda called Burgess a criminal and threatened to sue him for tarnishing his name.Ochondo said Burgess' accusations, presented without evidence, are primitive and politically motivated.He said if Dominion is on the verge of pulling out, it should do so without any scapegoats.He said the company has been operating like an opus military establishment and not like an agricultural firm.
