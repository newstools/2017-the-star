The Appeals court has granted doctors' union officials another seven days to finalise talks to end their strike that entered its 81st day on Thursday.KMPDU lawyers led by Siaya senator James Orengo requested the court to grant them the time, saying they were about to reach a solution."Seven days is more appropriate. Mediators know how parties have conducted themselves in the process," he said.But Council of Governors lawyer Eunice Lumalias challenged the ruling, suggesting a deal can be reached in a shorter period."Two days is sufficient for doctors to resolve the issues," she told the court.But a Court of Appeal ruled on February 16 that the jailed doctors be released with immediate effect.Judges Wanjiru Karanja, Okwengu and Jamila Mohamed also said negotiations would take place within seven days.Read: Appeals court frees doctors' union officials, talks to resumeAppellate judge Hannah Okwengu said today that they were happy with the direction the mediation was taking."We have considered this matter and are happy that the mediation process is going on.
