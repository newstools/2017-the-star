The Jomo Kenyatta Foundation yesterday gave 124 needy bright secondary school students four-year scholarships. The Sh28 million sponsorship will cover tuition fees. The beneficiaries include 62 girls and 62 boys. Chairman Walter Nyambati, however, warned the students that the publisher may stop the sponsorship if they don&rsquo;t work hard and remain disciplined in school. He said the beneficiaries were selected from hundreds of applicants who wanted the scholarships and must maintain discipline and high academic standards. &ldquo;This is an opportunity that can change your life if well used. We are giving you the scholarship for the four years, but you must maintain academic excellence, failure to which we will stop and give it to other deserving students,&rdquo; Nyambati said. He said JKF is grappling with inadequacy of funds to sponsor needy students to ensure they get equal opportunities in education.
