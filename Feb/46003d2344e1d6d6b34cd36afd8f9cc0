Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana&rsquo;s Muungano party could be headed for a coalition with Wiper. Kibwana on Monday hinted at an alliance when he met supporters in Kwa-Kathoka, Makueni. They said they want to meet Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka to discuss the issue. Kibwana said Kalonzo urged him to join Wiper to represent the party in NASA negotiations about who becomes the flagbearer. &ldquo;What Musyoka said was I can&rsquo;t be the party&rsquo;s representative if I don&rsquo;t belong to the party,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s what will help him get the nomination and unite the Kamba community, then we have to consult widely and decide together so we don&rsquo;t make a wrong decision.&rdquo; During a recent voter listing campaign in the county, Kalonzo urged Kibwana to dissolve his party and join Wiper to strengthen its bargaining power.
