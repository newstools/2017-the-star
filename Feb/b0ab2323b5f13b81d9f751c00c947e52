The government has put in place a comprehensive group life insurance cover for all prison officers, President Uhuru Kenyatta announced yesterday.He said the government is assessing budgetary allocations to ensure prisons receive the funds they need to improve staff housing for prison officers.Uhuru spoke at the Prisons Staff Training College in Ruiru where he presided over the passing out parade of 2,699 prisons recruits.The President, at the same time, directed the Interior Cabinet Secretary and Commissioner of Prisons to liaise with the Chief Justice regarding petty offenders to see if they could be released, to decongest prison cells.The President said some of the petty offenders have stayed longer in remand cells than they would have served jail terms if their cases were heard and determined.He also said the government has put in place measures to curb radicalisation and violent extremism in prisons. Uhuru said significant steps have been made in collaboration with the National Counter-Terrorism Centre to improve training for staff and rehabilitation programmes for inmates. &ldquo;A multi-agency task force, which I appointed to assess the capacity of Kenya Prisons Service, has concluded its assignment and presented the report for further review &ndash; which we will shortly be undertaking,&rdquo; the President said.To reduce crime, stem radicalisation and ensure security, Uhuru said prison institutions are required to offer not only retributive justice but also the prospect of reform. &ldquo;Our justice system exists not just to punish offenders or to deter possible offenders from doing wrong; it exists also to encourage those who have done wrong to change, and to once more contribute meaningfully to society,&rdquo; the President said. Uhuru commended the graduands for their diligence and commitment that saw them successfully complete the nine months training that included diploma and certificate in Security and Correctional Science. He praised them for contributing Sh1.265 million towards supporting those affected by the ongoing drought, saying the prisons fraternity in total donated more than Sh3.4 million to mitigate effects of drought.
