The government&rsquo;s delay in releasing Sh200 million to sink 50 boreholes has worsened the water shortage in Nairobi.The county government has warned residents of severe rationing next week, as water levels at the Ndakaini Dam drop to less than 40 per cent.The dam supplies more than 85 per cent of the city&rsquo;s water. The drop has been caused by drought in Kikuyu, the Aberdare Range and Mt Kenya &mdash; the main water catchment areas for rivers serving the Ndakaini Dam.Water executive Peter Kimori yesterday said the Treasury is yet to release the money, more than a month after the county and Water ministry agreed to start the project.&ldquo;Work will begin immediately we receive the money. We will get a state corporation to do the work, so there will be no tendering,&rdquo; he said.The city has 79 boreholes owned by the Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company, but only 56 are operating.Kimori said the remaining 23 have &ldquo;small problems&rdquo; and will be repaired.He urged residents to using water sparingly. &ldquo;Water supply has not improved.&rdquo;Yesterday, instead of supplying the usual 540,000 cubic metres, the city was only able to supply 430,000 cubic metres, Kimori said.Once again, he told car wash operators to close or risk arrest.A number are still operating by roadsides. Owners and workers complain that closing them will put many youth out of work, forcing some to turn to crime. &ldquo;The crackdown is still on. All car washes must close, unless they recyclewater or use their own boreholes,&rdquo; Kimori said. Last month, the NCWSC ordered car washes to conserve water.&ldquo;We are redistributing water while ensuring hospitals and airports are supplied seven days a week,&rdquo; he said.Most residents and businesses, including five-star hotels, are relying on vendors for water supply.
