Opposition leaders should mobilize their supporters to register and stop blaming the IEBC for low turn out in their strongholds, Jubilee secretariat boss Raphael Tuju has said. Tuju told off the team led by Cord chief Raila Odinga for accusing the commission of favouring the government."This issue of leaders being sensational should be stopped because even Jubilee Party has raised serious issues with the commission. We are waiting to hear from them," he said."For instance, in Tharaka Nithi there are 82 BVR machines and in Siaya there are 157. Nyeri has 152 while Bungoma has 219...we just need explanations on the criteria. We are not saying it is wrong," he said.Read:IEBC compromising voter register to list foreigners - RailaTuju said the party had written to the electoral agency asking it to president over its nominations but that here has been no response two months later."According to the constitution, IEBC should supervise party nominations.
