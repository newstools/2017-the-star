Eleven magistrates have been fired for alleged professional misconduct. The accusations vary from corruption to reporting to work drunk.The Judicial Service Commission yesterday said it took into account the principles of natural justice in reaching its final verdict.The nature of complaints against the magistrates included absenteeism, issuing rulings calculated to defeat the course of justice, sitting on a case already concluded and releasing a suspect on bond, receiving irregular allowances and delayed rulings and judgments. For example one magistrate had 204 pending judgments.In a statement, the JSC said it received complaints against 15 officers and gave them an opportunity to defend themselves against accusations both in writing and orally.The JSC reinstated one magistrate, issued a warning to one and deferred the case against two for further investigations.The commission said it is committed to ensuring that the Judiciary is accountable at all levels and will continue to exercise its disciplinary powers in all tiers of the institution.&ldquo;I wish to reiterate that the disciplinary process in the judiciary did not end with the vetting exercise and my appeal to judges, judicial officers and staff is to continue serving in a manner consistent with their oaths of office or code of conduct as the case may be,&rdquo; said Chief Justice David Maraga (pictured) who is also the JSC chairman.
