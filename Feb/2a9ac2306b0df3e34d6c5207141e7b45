Parklands MCA Jaffer Kassam has dismissed claims by former Cabinet minister Fred Gumo&rsquo;s son Mike that he has failed his constituents. On Tuesday, Mike accused the MCA of not starting any useful projects.But Kassam defended his record, saying he fought school land grabbers. &ldquo;I have repossessed 15 acres stolen from Bohra Primary School and the Highridge Secondary School compound grabbed during Gumo&rsquo;s tenure as MP of Westlands. What did his father do?&rdquo; he said. Kassam also said he erected a perimeter wall around Bohra and Highridge schools.
