As my buddy and senior Elias Obanyii has stated it's indeed true that I was not only kidnapped in broad daylight but also tortured and robbed of huge sum of cash on Saturday afternoon.Equally frightening is the fact that our kidnappers - four middle aged men, armed with a pistol, bullets, metal rod and police identification card - told us that they were indeed officers from the dreaded Kwekwe squad.They bundled me together with my cousin in a white saloon car, handcuffed us, beat us up senselessly with metal rods, fists, nearly strangled me to death and warned me of dire consequences if I ever reported.They eventually dumped us way past Kamiti Prison at around 2pm after confiscating our phones and made away with the loot.The incident happened just moments after withdrawing huge cash from the teller at Cooperative Bank, TRM branch.To our utter shock, when we went to report the matter at Kasarani Police station, no officer was willing to help.I bet the self confessed Kwekwe squad were still trailing us because while at the station trying to figure if we could have our statements taken, we were confronted by three thuggish looking young men (of around my age ) who wanted to ascertain whether we had been beaten up by police officers and whether we had captured the car number plate.Our assailants promised to deal with me thoroughly given that I'm a journalist should they read or see the report anywhere.Later in the evening with the help of an in-law I sought treatment at the Nairobi Hospital.I'm recovering but too traumatized and feel so insecure as I'm aware they are tracking my phone number and that of my fiancee.All in all, I thank God for saving our lives. Had this occurred in the cover of darkness my cousin and I could be probably be dead by now.
