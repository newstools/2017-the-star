The man behind a petition to sack Auditor General Edward Ouko yesterday failed to appear before a key House panel to present his evidence, citing death threats.Instead, Emanuel Mwagambo wrote to the Finance committee setting three conditions for his appearance.First, he wants to be heard behind closed doors, to submit a written memorandum and wants he and his family to be provided with state security. In his letter to the House panel chaired by Ainamoi MP Banjamin Lang&rsquo;at, Mwagambo said he has received numerous threats from unidentified people since he filed his petition.&ldquo;I have been forced to take a low profile because of the threats I have received. My petition touches on influential personalities,&rdquo; he wrote.The committee is supposed to investigate the allegations against Ouko and advise the House if the petitioner discloses enough evidence for Parliament to recommend thatthe President form a tribunal to probe him. Mwagambo has accused Ouko of gross violation of the Constitution by failing to submit timely audit reports to Parliament, skewed employment and violation of procurement rules.Yesterday, the committee had no objections to the petitioner&rsquo;s pleas.Members resolved to ask National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi to write to the Inspector General of Police seeking protection for the witness when he appears next Tuesday.&ldquo;We should not brush aside the concerns raised by the petitioner. Given the gravity of this matter, he could have stepped on a live wire somewhere,&rdquo; Voi MP Jones Mlolwa said. He added,&ldquo;The Auditor General is not an angel. He can also make a mistake. We need to protect this witness.&rdquo;
