A US congressman wants the Sh43 billion arms deal between Kenya and the United States stopped on grounds that it was fraudulently conceived, local media reported on Thursday. The Daily Nation said that Tedd Budd is seeking to halt the procurement of the 12 converted agricultural aircraft intended to boost the KDF war against al Shabaab."My office has received credible allegations of faulty contracting practices, fraud and unfair treatment surrounding this sale," Budd was quoted in the daily.According to the US Congress website, Budd and Democrat counterpart Duncan Hunter on February 14 presented the resolution of the Senate relating to the disapproval of the proposed foreign military sale to Kenya.They submitted the joint resolution which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the Senate pursuant to section 36(b)(1) of the US's Arms Export Control Act.&ldquo;That the issuance of a letter of offer with respect to any of the following proposed sales to the government of Kenya is hereby prohibited,&rdquo; the resolution reads in part.He wants the deal blocked by the US Congress for further investigations, adding that he knows of a company that will give Kenya a better deal on the weapons at half the quoted price.An official from the US State Department said in January that Kenya has agreed to pay the full cost of the weapons.The deal was to see Kenya purchase 12 Air Tractor AT-802L, two AT-504 Trainer aircraft, weapons package, technical support and program management from the US.The sale was to be handled by L-3 Communications &ndash; a Texas-based company which is the prime contractor; and Platform Integration Division, Waco, Texas.Read: United States approves Sh43 billion KDF weapons dealBudd argues that the contract was awarded without competitive bidding, citing that L-3 Communications lacks the experience to produce the said aircraft."We need to ensure that Kenya, being a long-time ally, gets a fair deal," Budd, according to the Daily Nation, said.He did elaborate the nature of fraud involved in Kenya's deal.The congressman rooted for IOMAX &ndash; a company based in his home turf, as the best placed to deliver the said weapons to the country.The company is viewed as the only contractor with a manned and weaponised airframe approved for export from the United States.IOMAX is also seen as the most suitable in the provision of an integrated, weaponised platform suitable for equipping and firing laser-guided munitions from a purpose-built airframe.The State Department is yet to respond to the claims, according to the reports in the local daily.
