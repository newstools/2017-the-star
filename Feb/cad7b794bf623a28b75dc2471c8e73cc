The country is expected to receive poor rains in the March-April-May long rain season, but flooding may also occur in parts of Budalang'i.Kenya Meteorological Department acting director Peter Ambenje said flash floods may occur in Western. He said the predicted onset and distribution of rainfall were derived from statistical analysis of past years, which exhibited similar characteristics with the current year. &ldquo;We are not out of the woods yet, the distribution of March to May 2017 seasonal rainfall, both in time and space, is expected to be generally poor in most parts of the country. Sunny and dry weather conditions will be dominant in Northeastern and the Coastal regions during the month of March, but a pick up in rainfall is however likely to occur in Western Kenya,&rdquo; Ambenje said. He was speaking yesterday during a media briefing on the weather outlook for the 2017 long rains season. He said Siaya, Kisumu, Homa Bay, Migori, Kisii, Nyamira, Trans Nzoia, Baringo, Uasin Gishu, Elgeyo Marakwet, Nandi and Laikipia counties will start receiving rain in the second to third week of March until June.&ldquo;Narok, Kajiado, Nairobi, Nyandarua, Nyeri, Kirinyaga, Murang'a, Kiambu, Meru, Embu, and Tharaka Nithi counties will have onset of rain from the third to fourth week of March, to continue until the first three to four weeks of May,&rdquo; Ambenje said.Nakuru county will receive rain from the third to fourth week of March till June, while Kitui, Makueni, Machakos and Taita Taveta counties will receive rain from the third and fourth weeks of March until May.Wajir, Garissa, Mandera and Marsabit will be dry during the month of March but will receive rain from the first and second weeks of April until the beginning of May. Ambenje added that the food security situation is expected to deteriorate over most parts of the country especially the northern areas of Kenya. &ldquo;Water scarcity is also expected to continue while the current problem of malnutrition may be on increase in the same areas,&rdquo; he said. Agriculture principal secretary Richard Lesiyampe has urged farmers to buy fertliser on time and prepare their land early to maximise on the rains."The 25 percent of subsided fertliser required for our farmers is already in the various deports in the country and will sold at a cost of Sh1,800 per 50 kg bag for planting and Sh1,500 for top dressing fertiliser," said Lesiyampe.
