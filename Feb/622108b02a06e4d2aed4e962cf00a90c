Kigumo MP Jamleck Kamau (pictured) has castigated Murang&rsquo;a Governor Mwangi Wairia for lacking creativity in his leadership. Jamleck on Saturday said Wairia lacks an agenda for Murang&rsquo;a and has resorted to copying projects from other leaders. &ldquo;It is sad that the governor has shown lack of vision,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have never had personal differences with Wairia. What we have are ideological conflicts.&rdquo;
