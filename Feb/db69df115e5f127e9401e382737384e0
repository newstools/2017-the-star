WE are horrified, disturbed and shocked by the jailing yesterday of doctors&rsquo; union officials by the Labour Court for their refusal to call off a legitimate strike.This action marks the lowest point that Jubilee&rsquo;s intransigence, incompetence and inability to lead has brought the nation to.Rather than resolve the crisis in the health sector, the jailing of union officials deepens it and sets an extremely dangerous precedent.It marks out the government as a dishonest and unreliable employer whose word, even in writing, counts for nothing. This has grim implications for resolving future conflicts between the government, employees and other entities, including the strike by university lecturers, which is equally taking a bad turn as the government fumbles.The idea that the courts are now the entities to resolve disputes between employers and employees is dangerous and disturbing. It goes against the constitutionally protected right of workers to withhold labour when they are in disagreement with the employer, and especially when the employer, in this case the government, is reneging on an agreement.Under the same article, every trade union, employers&rsquo; organisation and employer has the right to engage in collective bargaining.Unable to lead and negotiate, the government instead resorted to hostage taking. The court had created opportunities for the government to resolve the issues around the CBA it signed with doctors. The government spurned all those opportunities and instead took advantage of the suspended sentence to blackmail the doctors.The action is meant to arm-twist the doctors to accept what they don&rsquo;t agree with, when, in fact, the government is the problem.In fact, Cotu Secretary General Francis Atwoli, who tried to resolve the dispute, concluded that the infighting between Health Cabinet Secretary Cleopa Mailu and Principal Secretary Nicholas Muraguri had paralysed negotiations and appealed to the President to provide leadership.We have instructed our lawyers to immediately convene and take up the doctors&rsquo; case against the government.In the meantime, we are reminding President Uhuru Kenyatta that he has spent these last four years trying to avoid the problems that face Kenyans. The President has spent the four years assigning blame and avoiding responsibility.The President has spent these four years trying to look and remain cool, leading from behind, snubbing important issues and hoping that they resolve themselves.It&rsquo;s time the President owned up and let Kenyans know they are on their own.
