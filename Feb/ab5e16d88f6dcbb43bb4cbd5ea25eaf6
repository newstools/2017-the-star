The first six athletes to cross the line in each category at Athletics Kenya's national cross country trials will earn an automatic ticket to the World Championships.AK senior vice-president in charge of competitions Paul Mutwii said the national cross championship local organising committee had resolved no athlete will get a wild card and that each runner will have to endeavour to finish within the top six to gain qualification."We felt given the fact Kenya has abundant talent, all runners who finishes in the top six are good enough tp give the country good representation at the international stage in Uganda. It will be unnecessary to give special preference," he said.The AK national cross championship will be hosted at Nairobi's Uhuru Gardens on February 18 and will be streamed live.After the exit of Kenya Commercial Bank, Lotto Foundation have come on board as the new sponsors and have injected Sh12m for this year's season.The national cross country championships will feature five categories with 16 AK affiliates in participation.The categories include the Junior women's 6km, Junior men's 8km, Senior women's 10km, Senior men's 10km and mixed 8km relay races.In the mixed relay which will comprise a quarter of two men and two women per team will have a runner run one lap each which is a distance of 2km before passing the baton.The selected team is expected to move into residential training at Kigari Teachers Training College in Embu on February 23rd.The team will depart for Kampala, Uganda on March 23rd ahead of the World Cross Country Championships to be held on March 26.Mutwii said no individual runners and non nationals will be allowed to participate.He said anti doping measures will be in place with Anti Doping Agency of Kenya (ADAK) personnel conducting tests on the runners.The official said the top six winners will earn cash and the top runners and team's in each category will receive trophies.
