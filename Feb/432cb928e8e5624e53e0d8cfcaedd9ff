Patients with life threatening diseases will have free access to medical treatment if a proposed Bill by Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter becomes law. The Medical Fund Bill of 2016, seeks to establish a medical fund board that will identify and provide free treatment both locally and abroad to individuals whose body organ or organs and the whole body have been affected. The fund shall be administered by the board and will include any funds appropriated by the National Assembly, bilateral or multilateral donors, appropriations in aid, gifts grants, donations or endowments and monies from any other source provided for by the board. If passed by the National Assembly, cancer, heart complications and kidney failure will be considered among diseases where free treatment should be given by the state. &ldquo;We have seen many needy cases succumbing to these diseases just because they cannot afford treatment. This is something that we can afford as a country in this age,&rdquo; Keter said. The eligibility criteria for one to qualify to this fund requires that a person must be a Kenyan citizen and complies with any requirement prescribed in the regulations. The passage of the will be good news to the poor who cannot afford the expensive treatment regimes.
