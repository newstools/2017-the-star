Political analyst and media consultant David Makali has been removed as secretary general of the Labour Party of Kenya over what NEC members termed links with NASA.Makali is running for Bungoma senator.Organising secretary Peter ole Musei was named acting secretary general.The party made the decision on Thursday at a meeting at Olive Gardens Hotel, Nairobi.National youth treasurer Ignatius Nyukuri, who attended the NEC meeting, yesterday told the Star on the phone they decided to push Makali out after it became apparent he was pushing for the party to work with &ldquo;Raila Odinga&rsquo;s NASA&rdquo;. &ldquo;The majority of NEC members seem to be inclined to Jubilee. It&rsquo;s only Makali who has been pushing for the party to work with NASA,&rdquo; he said.Nyukuri said Makali had told the NEC meeting he had met Raila several times. Makali was also accused of failing to popularise LPK, even in his Bungoma backyard.Another source told the Star the meeting accused Makali of being dictatorial and arrogant when dealing with members and officials. Ababu Namwamba heads the Labour Party, which was re-energised after Namwamba&rsquo;s falling out with ODM. He has denied he is being funded by Jubilee. In December last year while touring Mombasa, Namwamba made a gaffe when he publicly referred to the Labour Party as Jubilee. This generated a lot of debate.Makali could not be reached for comment, he did not pick calls.He did say on a Labour Party WhatsApp group, &ldquo;This is the kind of nonsense I don&rsquo;t expect from any party, leave alone the one I belong to.&rdquo;Namwamba could also not be reached for comment.
