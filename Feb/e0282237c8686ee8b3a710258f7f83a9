Some Bomet residents want ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi named the NASA presidential flagbearer.The residents, allied to Governor Isaac Rutto&rsquo;s Chama Cha Mashinani, said the opposition should pick a &ldquo;sober and experienced leader&rdquo; to avoid unnecessary ethnic tension.They said Mudavadi fits the bill. The residents on Saturday said as voters of Bomet, the choice of a nominee to fly the NASA flag will definitely affect their support for the coalition.The group, led by Gilbert Rono, a Bomet Central MP aspirant, spoke in Bomet town. &ldquo;Mudavadi has the necessary qualities and experience to unite the country. He has not been associated with any of the financial scams that have bedeviled the country in the recent past,&rdquo; he said. They said the NASA founder stands a better chance of garnering more votes in the county and, by extension, from the Kalenjin community, saying he has good leadership skills. The group also asked the team to fast-track the naming of the flagbearer to end unnecessary anxiety among Kenyans.
