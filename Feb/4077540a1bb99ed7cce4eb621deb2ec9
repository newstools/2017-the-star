Water CS Eugene Wamalwa has told the opposition to stop maligning the Jubilee administration and instead engage in constructive criticism.He accused opposition leaders of spreading lies and propaganda to make Kenyans hate Jubilee.Wamalwa spoke on Monday in Tongaren, where said the opposition has forgotten its main role.&ldquo;We all know being in the opposition is not to attack the government every now and then but to keep it in check,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said.&ldquo;A responsible opposition is supposed to offer the government positive criticism that will help keep it on its toes, not spread lies and propaganda aimed at maligning the governments.&rdquo;Wamalwa defended the Jubilee administration against accusations that it has done little to improve Kenyans&rsquo; livelihoods. He said the government&rsquo;s work is evident in roads, health, education and many other sectors &mdash; a feat he said previous administrations did not achieve. Wamalwa urged the opposition to give credit to the government for what it has done and called for respect among leaders. Leadership comes and goes and if the opposition leaders become assume power tomorrow, they will want to be respected too, he said.&ldquo;Jubilee has revived the Pan-Paper Mills in Webuye. We&rsquo;ve built several roads here in Bungoma, launched water projects, built schools and brought drugs, and yet some still can&rsquo;t see this.
