PNU leader Peter Munya (pictured) has said the party has gained a national outlook ahead of the opening of offices in 11 counties in two weeks. Speaking in Tigania West, he said Meru Senator Kiraitu Murungi&rsquo;s dissolution of the Alliance Party of Kenya to join the Jubilee Party worked in PNU&rsquo;s favour. Munya said this opened doors for him to be part of a party that has a national reach.
