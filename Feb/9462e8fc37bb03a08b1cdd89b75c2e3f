Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga&rsquo;s Kakan clan is divided over whether to endorse him or Rarieda MP Nicholas Gumbo &mdash;jeopardising his reelection.One group is led by ODM leader Raila Odinga&rsquo;s maternal uncle Peter Odima and Rasanga&rsquo;s devoted political operative Wayodi .The other group is that of Mzee Nicholas Nyadiang&rsquo;, who is the chairman of the Kakan.Odima played a key role in introducing Rasanga to politics in 2012, but has shifted his allegiance to Gumbo.Ugenya politician Steve Mwanga said Odima&rsquo;s defection to Gumbo&rsquo;s camp has dealt Rasanga a huge blow, given his (Odima&rsquo;s) influence and blood relations with the Odinga family. Mwanga said Rasanga&rsquo;s entry into the governor race was mooted at Parklands Hotel, Nairobi, in a meeting chaired by nominated MP Oburu Oginga. He said Oburu directed him (Mwanga) to call Odima to inform him of their choice for governor and tell him he was a political greenhorn from the civil service. Odima has on numerous occasions attempted to broker a truce between the governor and Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo, who supports Gumbo.
