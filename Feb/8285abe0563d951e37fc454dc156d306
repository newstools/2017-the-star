Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana has said he does not need direct nomination to run for reelection and is ready to contest for the Wiper ticket.The governor&rsquo;s Muungano Party and Wiper recently entered into a coalition agreement, and there was speculation that one condition for the pact was a direct nomination for Kibwana.In the agreement, Muungano supporters had insisted that the governor gets a direct nomination in Wiper as a condition for joining the party.This was vehemently opposed by some Wiper leaders, who said they also want to run for the same seat.Businessman David Masika and former Kaiti MP Gideon Ndambuki threatened to go to court to oppose such a decision.No one can beat meSpeaking on Sunday, Kibwana said, &ldquo;Because there are those who have come out to say that they are also interested in vying for Makueni governor under Wiper, yet we know they lack the capacity, I welcome them all for a free and fair nomination. They should not think that we are afraid of them.&rdquo;He spoke in Ithaeni Market, Kathaini, when he joined other leaders from Machakos county to launch a Wiper membership registration drive.Kivutha said the nomination contest will give him the chance to beat some of his challengers early and allow him time to concentrate on Wiper&rsquo;s national campaign.His sentiments ended speculations that he and his Muungano Party members were uncomfortable with the agreement with Wiper.Kibwana said his decision to join Wiper was informed by the urge to support Kalonzo Musyoka in the ongoing NASA presidential negotiations.I&rsquo;m here to back Kalonzo&ldquo;Kalonzo asked me to join Wiper so that I can not only help him in bringing the people of this region together, but also help him in the ongoing NASA negotiations. And I want to work well with all other Wiper leaders, including Machakos Senator Johnston Muthama, Kitui Senator David Musila and Makueni Senator Mutula Kilonzo Jr,&rdquo; he said.Some leaders, who were with Kibwana, accused Muthama of representing the interests of other parties in stead of Wiper in the NASA CommitteeThey are MPs Robert Mbui (Kathiani), Patrick Makau (Mavoko), Peter Mathuki (EALA) and Machakos woman representative Susan Musyoka.&ldquo;Senator Muthama went to Kwale during the burial of Kwale Senator Boy Juma Boy and said that the deceased wanted Raila to become the flagbearer of NASA, yet we had sent him to that committee to represent the interests of Wiper,&rdquo; Mbui said.Mathuki said Muthama is advocating for interests of another party and should be withdrawn from the committee. Kibwana should replace the senator, he said.
