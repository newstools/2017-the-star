Strathmore University duo of Constant Wakhura and Derrick Kuloba have switched allegiance to Butali Sugar Warriors men&rsquo;s team ahead of 2017 Kenya Hockey Union league.The two players were key for the varsity side, which won last year&rsquo;s KHU Premier League after beating former holders Butali 3-1 in the final on a post-match penalty .Strathmore coach Meshack Senge admitted it&rsquo;s big blow for the students, who were planning to go all out in defence of the title. However, the tactician remained hopeful that even without the two, the squad would still live up to the challenge. Wakhura, a defender and a captain is a good player, whose leadership skills both on and of the pitch will be missed. As for Kuloba, he was instrumental player in our team and we wish him well at his new club.&ldquo;The team wishes both the players all the best at their new found base. We can&rsquo;t stand in their way as that would interfere with the spirit of sportsmanship and growth. Thanks to the partnership between Strathmore University and Brookside Kenya Secondary School Sports Association, where we get new players every other year. I hope their positions will be filled,&rdquo; noted Senge, who doubles up as the men&rsquo;s national team coach.At the same time, Senge has asked the league orgainsers to revert fro the current pool to unified format. The tactician said the pooling system tends to kill the competition aspect of the league.&ldquo;I hope the 2017 league will be unified. This format gives chance to the teams to play all the other sides in the premier league while giving them a chance to gauge their performance going forward unlike the pooling system, where you only get to play those teams that you have been pooled together against,&rdquo; observed Senge.Senge, who also coaches Strathmore women&rsquo;s tea, said they will be going a step further this time around to capture the league title having finished second last season behind Orange Telkom.
