The county Treasury yesterday said the implementation of the administrative units will increase the county wage bill by Sh140 million annually. MCAs warned Governor Wycliffe Oparanya against hiring campaigners. &ldquo;We hope the village and community administrators will not be turned into a campaign machine because the election is round the corner,&rdquo; minority leader Titus Kwomah said.Shirugu-Mugai MCA Albert Wetundu accused the committee of hiving off a section of his ward. The county will rely on village and community leaders to implement policies and programmes. In the past, the county has relied on ward administrators.
