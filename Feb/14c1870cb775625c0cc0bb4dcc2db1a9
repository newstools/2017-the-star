Rainfall is expected in several parts of the country in the next one week, according to the Kenya Meteorological department.The rains, which started in some parts last week, are expected to ease the ravaging drought.Counties facing drought include Marsabit, Mandera, Wajir, Garissa and Isiolo, where light showers are expected between Saturday and Monday morning.Sunny intervals will be experienced in the afternoon. However, Turkana, West Pokot and Samburu will experience high temperatures and sunny intervals throughout the week.Meteorological services deputy director Ayub Shaka said the rains are a result of a cold air mass from the Congo basin.&ldquo;This is a normal fluctuation of the rain belt,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When the rainy season is over, we have an occasional swing of the belt.&rdquo;Shaka said Kenya normally experiences the east-west (zonal) belt and the north-south belt simultaneously.Currently, the Congo air mass has triggered the east-west belt only and that is why the rains are mostly concentrated in Western Kenya, with some showers spreading to the Rift Valley and Central.In November last year, the government, through the National Drought Management Authority, issued a warning of a possible severe drought if rains failed.This followed a low record of the quantity and distribution of rainfall, particularly in arid counties and at the Coast.So far, more than 23 counties are drought-stricken, among them Tana River, Kwale, West Pokot, Tharaka Nithi, Mandera, Marsabit, Turkana, Kilifi, Wajir, Kitui, Garissa, Baringo and Samburu.Temperatures are expected to drop around Mt Kenya and the highlands and rise in arid areas such as Lodwar and Northeastern counties.
