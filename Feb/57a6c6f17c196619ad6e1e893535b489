The National Assembly Lands committee has summoned three state officials for possible links to the eviction of Dunge Unuse residents and demolition of their houses in 2010 and 2015.They are regional coordinator Nelson Marwa, National Land Commission chairperson Mohamed Swazuri and former Changamwe police boss Joseph Muthee.The committee suspects Marwa issued eviction orders and Muthee oversaw demolitions under the guard of heavily armed AP officers.Swazuri is said to have allegedly failed to use his constitutional powers to block the evictions and demolitions.The law states that only the NLC can evict people from public land. In such as a case, the commission must issue a three-month notice.Committee chairperson Moses ole Sekuda concluded the land is a public property and an eviction could not have taken place without Swazuri&rsquo;s consent.The five-acre parcel had about 4,000 residents. It is surrounded by a perimeter wall whose construction was approved by the county government. This led to the suspicion that the local authorities might have been involved in the alleged land grab. But county Lands executive Anthony Njaramba denied any involvement.MP Omar Mwinyi said a &ldquo;briefcase company&rdquo;, only identified as Westlands Properties Ltd, which claims ownership is not listed by the registrar of companies. &ldquo;The row started when the KPA was being expanded. The land has economic value and this explains why people are keen to have it. But you will not be evicted from here,&rdquo; Mwinyi said.A former President has been linked to the plans to take over the land.Funyula MP Paul Otuoma said two fake court orders were used by police to harass residents. He said the eviction and demolition were illegal.Otuoma said, &ldquo;Investigation must be conducted to know how the fake orders were generated and all those involved brought to justice. Judiciary shall not be used to stamp on the downtrodden.&rdquo;
