Parliament's committee on health on Wednesday declared former Public Health PS Mark Bor a hostile witness.The ex-state official was sent away after he failed to explain to the MPs why he signed the doctor's CBA while out of office.The committee vowed to take action against Bor after he claimed that the disputed doctors' CBA was not the final agreement.Bor told MPs that he signed the agreement after relinquishing his position.He was unable to tell MPs where he got the authority to sign the document on behalf of the ministry."Even if I signed it, this was not the final document that could be forwarded for registration," he said.He argued that he signed the document for the Ministry of Medical Services to own the doctors' demands."Union officials kept changing positions on their demands," Bor said.Parliament committee on health proposed that the document be disregarded because it was signed illegally.The doctor's strike, which was staged on grounds that the government failed to honour the said agreement, is in its third month.KMPDU Secretary General Ouma Oluga, after spending two days in jail, said they are committed to talks to end the strike.This was after he and five other officials were freed following a Court of Appeal decision.The Appeals court overruled the Labour Relations court decision that the medics spend one month in jail.Justice Hellen Wasilwa sent the six doctors' union officials to prison for contempt of court.Read: Doctors' union officials jailed one month for contempt of courtAlso read: Wasilwa was right to jail doctors&rsquo; union officials, says Chief Justice Maraga
