Leaders from Nyanza region have been put on notice for failing to help ODM leader Raila Odinga in campaigns to win the August 8 polls.Party secretary for political affairs Opiyo Wandayi said it it pointless for leaders to be in Parliament without State power."The votes we are looking for during Mass Voter Registraton is strictly for Raila and not to elect other positions. My position and others can be elected with the few votes in place and not the presidential one," he said on Saturday.Wandayi said there is no need for governors, senators, MPs and MCAs from the region to campaign for their position if they are not helping Raila.He said Nyanza leaders need to work out strategies that can increase turnout to register many voters before the February 14 deadline.He also challenged ODM party officials to deliver Raila's votes or ship out."The job we have remained with in a span of one week is for party officials, aspirants, elected leaders and chiefs to distribute all uncollected IDs in their offices," he said.The Ugunja MP said there is no way aspirants and incumbents will be elected with votes they did not look for."ODM aspirants should know what their effort towards voter registration is their first vetting we will consider as a party," he added.Opposition strongholds have been on the spot for low registration, turnout and apathy as IEBC conducts Mass Voter Registration countrywide.In its second week, Central Nyanza IEBC coordinator George Oyugi noted that Homa Bay and Siaya counties have listed only 60,000 new voters against the projected 500,000.IEBC had also said that Central Kenya and Rift Valley have taken an early lead in the percentage of newly registered voters in the first week of the month-long drive.More on this: Central nets many voters as Western, Nyanza lagRead: Homa Bay risks voter apathy as ID application forms run outIn the Coast, Governors Hassan Joho (Mombasa) and Amason Kingi (Kilifi) said they will implement the &lsquo;adopt-a-polling-station&rsquo; strategy as suggested by Raila.Also read: Joho, Kingi pledge to protect opposition's Coast votesThe strategy will see the deployment of supports to guard votes at the country's 44,000 polling stations.Raila said it was used in Ghana&rsquo;s general election in December.
