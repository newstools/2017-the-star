The Kenya Publishers Association yesterday told Education CS Fred Matiang&rsquo;i not to implement the new curriculum in a hurry.Chairman David Waweru said the association needs at least eight months to conduct a thorough research to develop &lsquo;a good book guide&rsquo;. &ldquo;What we are asking is to ensure that we do not just have a good document, but its implementation is done in a structured way,&rdquo; he said. Waweru said the association is concerned about the increased rate of pirated materials being used in primary and secondary schools. &ldquo;Seventy per cent of such materials contain wrong content,&rdquo; he said. Waweru said the information is either incorrect with missing and mixed up pages, as well as poorly printed text, which learners can barely read.&ldquo;Book piracy has become a major threat to the dissemination of accurate and reliable book content in the Kenya&rsquo;s learning institutions. On average, 30 per cent of the books used in our schools are counterfeits, with KCSE set-books even more worrying at between 40-50 per cent,&rdquo; he said.Anti-Piracy Committee chairman Simon Sossion said the books have found their way into schools through unscrupulous traders. He said almost Sh15 billion is lost in publishing due to piracy. Sossion spoke during the launch of new security Chiktag codes for KCSE setbooks.
