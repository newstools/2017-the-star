The University of Nairobi management has put pressure on staff to petition Parliament for additional funding or risk layoffs.This is after the state slashed Sh1.7 billion from the university&rsquo;s budget.The management said the institution is already struggling to pay salaries.Vice chancellor Peter Mbithi (pictured)yesterday told the College of Biological Sciences staff - both lecturers and non-teaching employees - the university will be unable to pay them this month because it has been unable to raise funds from students enrolled on parallel programmes.&ldquo;I struggled to get an overdraft to pay salaries last month. Now we are not going to be able to pay salaries this month, for reasons you know. We have told all staff repeatedly that we work to pay our own salaries,&rdquo; he said.Students on the parallel programme contribute about Sh250 million.&ldquo;Unless something comes from outer space or wherever and finds its way to us, we will suffer. The university is going to suffer Sh1.7 billion capitation cut and if this happens at all by July 1, we are not going to have a university,&rdquo; Mbithi said.The management has criticised the Education ministry for using &ldquo;wrong numbers&rdquo; to draw the student population and reduce funding from Sh6.2 billion to Sh4.5 billion in the 2017-18 budget.The system provides that funding public universities be based on the cost of running academic programmes with respect to the number of students enrolled in each programme.&ldquo;I am not fighting the system. I&rsquo;m a strong defender of it. But some people cannot use it improperly to punish others,&rdquo; Mbithi said.Deputy VC Isaac Mbeche said, &ldquo;I managed to look at the way it was done for this university and I suspect the numbers we have been given are totally wrong. How can you say that this university has an equivalent of 30,000 students? The College of Humanities alone has about 50,000 students.&rdquo;He urged the staff to petition Parliament to reallocate the Sh1.7 billion and appealed for more funding.&ldquo;We are crying for help and appealing to you and MPs who are your relatives to help us,&rdquo; Mbeche said.
