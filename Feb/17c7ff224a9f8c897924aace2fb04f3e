Senior chiefs of private companies who bribe government officials to win fat state tenders will be pursued and investigated for prosecution and conviction, the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission warned yesterday.Chairman Eliud Wabukala said public procurement, where the government does business with the private sector, is the biggest source of corruption and bribery running into tens of billions of shillings every year.Wabukala said the anti-graft agency will build strong cases against chief executives involved in corruption in collusion with state officers under the Bribery Act 2016.The new law, which was proposed by the private sector, has addressed the gaps in the judicial systems that made it difficult to sue the giver and taker of bribes, the graft czar said, adding the vice is rife in international tendering.&ldquo;We are laying modalities to assist the private sector in curbing corruption. The EACC will put in place preventive measures, but those who go beyond will be arrested and put behind bars to protect Kenya [from corruption],&rdquo; Wabukala said. &ldquo;The law is very clear.&rdquo; The bill was passed by Parliament on December 1 and assented to by President Uhuru Kenyatta on December 23, 2016. The law provides for a fine of up to Sh5 million for those found guilty, or a 10-year jail term or both.Other penalties include barring the guilty directors from serving in any other company for up to 10 years, and being fined up to five times the bribe received or given.The Act criminalises corruption, and it is the first law to target private firms who for long have been left outside the ring of graft purge.Wabukala said the commission is benchmarking with the UK's Bribery Act where successful prosecutions have taken place. He was speaking in Nairobi during a forum on the Bribery Act organised by the Kenya Association of Manufacturers.Central Bank chairman Mohammed Nyaoga and governor Patrick Njoroge asked the government to implement the law to the letter.&ldquo;Systems have to work. We have created very good laws in this country but enforcement has always been a problem,&rdquo; Nyaoga, who drafted the bill for the private sector, said. &ldquo;Authorities must act if we are to make any meaningful gains. The missing links in our laws is the execution.&rdquo;KAM chief executive Phyllis Wakiaga said although the private sector supports the government in fighting corruption, systems must be efficient to curb the vice.&ldquo;Once we have inefficiencies, you create loopholes and put the private sector at a very awkward position,&rdquo; Wakiaga said.Corruption has been blamed for increasing transactional costs, tax evasion and unfair competition.Kenya could not account for Sh608 billion (a third of the state budget) lost to corruption, the Auditor General report 2015 shows.
