The Kenya Revenue Authority yesterday dismissed claims by a section of clearing and forwarding agents that the Customs and Border Control department was hampering their operations through the ongoing licensing programme. The agency said it has the mandate to renew licences of the Kenya International Freight and Warehousing members annually under the East African Community Customs Management Act. &ldquo;Given the criticality of clearing and forwarding services in safeguarding national security and public revenue, it is imperative that persons entrusted with this role, exhibit the highest standards of ethical and business conduct,&rdquo; KRA said in a statement. &ldquo;The ongoing initiative to evaluate applicant suitability is meant to achieve this objective prior to the renewal of licences.&rdquo;
