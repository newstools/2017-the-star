THE spate of killings around the country in Baringo, Elgeyo Marakwet, Kitui and Laikipia in the run-up to only the second presidential reelection bid in the post-Kanu era is worrying. The first presidential reelection bid was by Mwai Kibaki in 2007 and many isolated pre-election violence episodes preceded the post-election violence of early 2008 across the country.The totally inadequate national security response to the atrocities in Laikipia and Kitui, where armed herders and their animals have descended on multi-billion dollar conservancies and on settled smallholder farm communities alike, is unacceptable. In both areas people have been shot dead and displaced. Paramilitary and military responses should have swiftly repulsed the raiders and handed them over to civilian policing and the courts.Instead, the communities and the regular police have been overwhelmed and the county governments have no security forces.An ethnic cleansing element is discernible and the cattle rustlers undoubtedly have political and land-grab agenda godfathers.The government must end this thuggery at once.
