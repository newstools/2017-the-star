Migori Governor Okoth Obado has not defected to a smaller party, his office has said.Political adviser Denis Orero told the press that reports in The Standard on Tuesday that Obado is one of the defectors are untrue.The paper reported that politicians are fleeing major parties to smaller outfits with guaranteed direct nominations.&ldquo;Obado is in the Orange party to stay. We wish to clarify that the matter was put to rest last year and these are attempts to plant doubts in voters&rsquo; minds,&rdquo; he said.Obado was elected on the PDP ticket in the March 4, 2013, general election after shambolic ODM nominations.He announced his decision to go back last year at Migori county stadium during a rally led by Cord leader Raila Odinga. Speculation that Obado might return to PDP have been rife in social media after his team used PDP colours to brand a vehicle convoy during Raila&rsquo;s last visit.
