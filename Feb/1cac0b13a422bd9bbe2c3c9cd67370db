When Chief Justice David Maraga recently appointed a Land and Environmental judge to serve Nyandarua county, it seemed normal for much of the country. But for Nyandarua residents it was a significant first.Maraga announced that construction of a Sh350 million High Court in Ol Kalou would start immediately. The building will house at least three judges and magistrates&rsquo; courts. It will take 18 months to complete and should be operational by the close of 2018.A law court has been put up in Engineer town and another is nearing completion at the county government headquarters in Ol Kalou. For the first time since Independence, seeking justice within Nyandarua will be possible. Now, we have no excuse for mob justice.As the immediate former chief officer in charge of Communication, Legal, ICT and Intergovernmental Relations, I am pleased the CJ responded to our concerns.The gains in the legal sector are part of wider, ongoing reforms by the county government.The department spearheaded legislation of key laws on alcohol production, distribution and consumption, the bursary kitty, the Cooperative Development Fund, boda boda operation and other sectors.The ICT directorate set up the county website to enhance internal advertisement, saving Nyandarua millions of shillings in revenue. It has developed infrastructure, including the Local Area Network and Wide Area Network.Electronic tax collection is underway, saving the county millions of shillings lost in the hands of dishonest collectors.Further, it has established the first information hub at the Kenya National Library Service&rsquo;s Ol Kalou unit in conjunction with the Communication Authority of Kenya.The unit has a stable internet connection and 10 computers for online research and communication.In yet another partnership, with Airtel Kenya, we expanded access to internet across various public schools.And for the first time, staff at the county headquarters and their counterparts in Kipipiri, Kinangop, Ndaragwa and Ol Joro Orok subcounties can clock in via a biometric system installed by our ICT team a few days ago.The department&rsquo;s directorate of intergovernmental relations has continued to support Nyandarua&rsquo;s collective engagement with the national government and other counties through the Council of Governors. It always prioritises our people&rsquo;s interests around pressing issues, including the health crisis and other transition issues.Finally, the directorate of communication and public relations recently launched the county government&rsquo;s first newspaper &ndash; Nyandarua Today - in conjunction with the Governor&rsquo;s Press Service.The 16-pages, full colour publication, whose print run is 30,000 copies, has been received well across Nyandarua, including on the county website and social media platforms.As expected, the dominant voice is that of the county government, detailing work done so far, progress attained, and some persistent challenges.Also included, however, are varying perspectives on the road Nyandarua has taken since 2013, firmly anchoring the publication in the hallowed tradition of critical thinking.Having found its voice through Nyandarua Today, the county can now enhance its dialogue with itself.On my way out, I leave behind a youthful but committed team across all our directorates, ready to move Nyandarua forward.In the immediate, I am committing myself to serving the community in Nyandarua&rsquo;s Kaimbaga ward, as its next MCA. The writer is Nyandarua's immediate-former chief officer in charge of the Department of Communication, Legal, Information Communication Technology and Intergovernmental Relations. (wmkigwa@gmail.com)
