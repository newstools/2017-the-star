The University of Nairobi&rsquo;s could be in the red, with officials warning that it will not be able to meet its statutory obligations and pay salaries this month.Even though a risk analysis report said to have emanated from the VC&rsquo;s office blames the financial crisis on government budget cuts, a source familiar with the financial management of the institution blamed it on unsound management and spending.However, Deputy Vice Chancellor of Students Affairs Isaac Mbeche, who doubles in an acting capacity as DVC Administration and Finance, disputed the claim of financial impropriety.He told the Star the financial woes are a result of government budget cuts and the ongoing lecturers&rsquo; strike. Students have stopped paying fees due to the strike, Mbeche added.&ldquo;As we speak we have not collected fees for a month and even if government capitation comes, we won&rsquo;t be able to pay salaries for this month,&rdquo; he said.The government plans to cut the university&rsquo;s annual budget from Sh6.2 billion to Sh4.5 billion in 2017-18, which Mbeche warned might lead to lay-offs and winding up of some core courses.Reduced state fundingIntroduction of the Differential Unit Cost by the government in July is said to have led to budget cuts. It will make future funding to universities mainly based on cost of funding a programme, for instance science-based programmes will attract more funding than humanities programmes.In the past, only the number of students informed the public universities&rsquo; funding.A source at UoN told the Star, &ldquo;Now the university has taken up the new funding formula as an excuse and whipping up emotions to mask the ongoing financial rot, and even warning that they wont be able to meet their financial obligations this month and blame it on budget cuts that are yet to be effected.&rdquo;Another source added, &ldquo;What we are looking for is unnecessary scapegoats. The revenue sources that the university has are enough to sustain it without the government budget if we were using funds ... well and on their intended purpose.&rdquo;The university&rsquo;s monthly wage bill stands at Sh770 million, the government pays Sh527 million and the difference of Sh243 million is settled by revenue from Module II (self-sponsored) students.A staffer said, &ldquo;Last week the VC told us the university can&rsquo;t raise the difference, meaning we will go without salaries end of this month. Other than the government budget cuts, the excuse he gave was that the students were on strike. Which came as a shocker to us as school fees by the majority of students are paid in advance.&rdquo;DVC Mbeche said the total annual overhead costs stand at Sh18.1 billion, according to their 2016-17 rationalisation.It is estimated that the university collects between Sh6-Sh10 billion as fees from self-sponsored students and more than Sh6 billion is generated annually from projects, grants and consultancy services.&ldquo;With such a revenue base, the university can run without any dependence on government funding, but we are here today because of imprudent spending,&rdquo; a source said, explaining that the university has been surviving in the past on bank overdrafts that have since been abolished by government.We get less cash than people claimBut Mbeche said, &ldquo;The cash from grants, consultancies and research projects goes directly to the researchers with donor&rsquo;s conditions. The university only gets less than 15 per cent of that money for administration.&ldquo;The revenue from Module II is also used to support other programmes and run the university. The government doesn&rsquo;t cater for operations and maintenance costs.&rdquo;
