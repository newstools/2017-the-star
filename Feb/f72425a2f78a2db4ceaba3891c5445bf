Former journalist Moses Dola has started an entertainment company that gives jobs to ex-convicts. Himself an ex-con, he found it hard for people to look past that tag when he sought employment, so he started his own entertainment company, D-Entertainment.Dola had the idea for 9 years before he started college. The entertainment outfit provides sound and entertainment for corporates and social events. His crew of comedians, dancers and MC's total to 12. All ex convicts. Dola was&nbsp;incarcerated&nbsp;after he was named the main suspect in the murder of his wife, Wambui Kabiru. His case is yet to be concluded. "Prison life is not what you can expect. You leave and you have a tag. Through out my time in prison I got to nurture&nbsp;their&nbsp;talent and when they did their time and got out, we teamed up. There are no jobs and we have to stay clear off a life of crime." His dancers were contestants of the popular dance TV show Sakata, prison edition.Speaking about his experience in prison, Dola said, "It is not easy. First of all being a journalist, I was always in and out of places, so once you are in prison, you fond yourself confined, you don't have extra room to move around. And there is no communication with the outside world, you are in a mental torture zone."As an ex-convict, Dola said that the most things they need when they re-enter society is "love, acceptance and a roof complete with accommodation and a job. But with stigma, it is not easy."
