An Embu governor aspirant has urged the national government to construct four mega dams that Water Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa launched a year ago. They are Thambana, Thuci, Rupingaci and Kamumu. Njagih Kumantha (pictured) of the Democratic Party said Mbeere North and Mbeere South subcounties face serious drought and famine. He said the situation in arid and semi-arid lands is worsening because of failed rains and drying of most rivers. Kumantha said residents have nothing to eat and are desperate.Thuura, Thiba and Ena are some of the rivers which have dried up. Kumantha said residents walk long distances in search of water for domestic use.
