The Elgeyo Marakwet county assembly is mobilising Sh60 million through a supplementary budget to feed 8,000 starving families as one person has reportedly died of hunger.The assembly on Thursday passed a motion to compel the county executive to re-allocate funds previously earmarked for various projects to set up a kitty that will enable the county to supply relief food to starving residents for the next three months.Arror MCA Christopher Chemosong, who is also Budget committee vice chairman, said six wards in the drier areas of Kerio Valley are the worst-hit by the ravaging drought.Chemosong said the food shortage is exacerbated by frequent bandit attacks that have disrupted farming.He said the funds will also supplement the government&rsquo;s school feeding programme and facilitate peace efforts.
