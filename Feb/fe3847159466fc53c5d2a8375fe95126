City Hall says it is not aware the Kenya Forest Services gave it 50 acres for the expansion of the Langata Cemetery.The county requested KFS to allow it to use a 67-acre forest as a new graveyard near the filled-up 100-acre cemetery.But the agency refused and asked what the county did with 50 acres the government gave it in the early 1990s to expand the graveyard.In an interview with the Star, county secretary Robert Ayisi said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have any information [about the land]. I read [about] it in the paper. So I must look at the records. Even when I was the chief health officer, I didn&rsquo;t see such records.&rdquo;recycling gravesThe Lang&rsquo;ata Cemetery, which was meant to accommodate 50,000 bodies, was declared full in 1996. It has more than 100,000 bodies now.But residents have been digging up graves halfway down to bury extra bodies on top. This violates the recommended six-foot depth.Last month, Lands executive Christopher Khaemba said, &ldquo;We have asked KFS to take the cemetery and convert it to forest and they give us their land next to the cemetery.&rdquo;But KFS Natural Forest Conservation and Management deputy director Charity Munyasia said though they are yet to receive a formal request from City Hall, they will reject it.&ldquo;Converting forest to other uses is tedious. It must be degazetted and this must pass Parliament,&rdquo; she said.Last week, Environment CS Judy Wakhungu reaffirmed KFS&rsquo;s position, saying: &ldquo;That is it. A forest is a forest, it cannot be a cemetery.&rdquo;Ayisi said, however, the county is talking with the Lands ministry and National Land Commission to compulsorily acquire it on its behalf.Khaemba had said the plan to swap property followed KFS&rsquo;s rejection of a request to sell the land to the county.
