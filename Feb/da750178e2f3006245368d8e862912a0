He wanted to run for MP in 2013 but dissuaded from his bid and instead encouraged to become Nderitu Gachagua's running mate in the governor contest. And today, Samuel Wamathai, 61, will be sworn in as the Nyeri governor following the death of his boss on Friday.Gachagua, 64, died at 2am at the Royal Marsden Hospital in London after a long battle with pancreatic cancer.Wamathai who comes from Muruguru village, Nyeri Town constituency, is mostly known as &lsquo;ambassador&rsquo; in Nyeri since he stayed abroad for many years before shifting base in 2011 when he declared his candidature for the Nyeri Town MP on the GNU ticket.At that time, Gachagua had picked Athi Water Services Board chairman Wachira Keen as his running mate on the GNU ticket, but shortly after Keen joined TNA.He lost in Nyeri governor nominations to Wahome Gakuru.Wamathai was later approached by Gachagua to be his running mate and dropped his interest for Nyeri Town MP.He is described by many as humble and non-controversial, but extremely wealthy.Wamathai kept a low profile when Gachagua was in charge. It is only last week that he started hitting the ground to commission roads that the county government has been upgrading.Despite the low profile, Wamathai supported Gachagua all through.He will be sworn in today at Town Hall in an event presided over by Nyeri resident judge Jairus Ngaa.Residents are keenly waiting to see if he will send packing Gachagua&rsquo;s cabinet or will retain the county executives in his new lineup.Wamathai holds a Masters degree in Air and Space Law from McGill University, and an Advanced Certificate on Air Transport Management, Economics and Strategic Planning from Massachusetts Institute of Technology.In preparation for today&rsquo;s swearing in, Nyeri speaker Mwangi Mugo on Friday told the assembly that he was consulting with the Attorney General&rsquo;s office for the ceremony to be conducted immediately so that there is no power vacuum.The speaker said since Gachagua was the first governor to die in office since the devolved governments were established, there was need to consult the AG to give the way forward.Mugo urged Nyeri residents to give them time for consultations so that everything is done constitutionally.Wamathai assured Nyeri residents that there is no vacuum of power as all activities are ongoing.He said Gachagua&rsquo;s wish was to improve Nyeri and residents' livelihoods.
