Musalia Mudavadi has reaped big in Bungoma after members from Jubilee, ODM and Ford Kenya defected to ANC.Secretary Martin Wailula told the Star on Monday that the defectors have already made payments to become party members.He said the new members will officially be received by Mudavadi when he visits Bungoma this week."[Mudavadi] will host several rallies and receive the defectors," Wailula said.Over the past two weeks, 20 out of 45 MCAs have moved to Mudavadi's party.Among them are minority leader John Musakali, majority whip Bethwel Mwambu, and PAC chair John Nanyakha.Aspirants who were initially vying on Moses Wetang'ula's Ford Kenya have jumped ship to ANC.They include Joseph Wataka (Sirisia), Peter Makokha (Kimilili), Vitalis Musebe and Michael Walekhwa (Webuye West).Trans Nzoia Governor Patrick Khaemba also indicated that he will ditch Ford Kenya for ANC.Reliable sources say the Governor has already made payments to be a life member after citing frustrations and witchhunts in Ford Kenya.Observers say ANC may be receiving many defectors because aspirants and incumbents, especially MCAs, are apprehensive over party primaries."Most people fear going through rigorous nominations and that's why you see many sitting politicians ditching their primaries to new upcoming parties," Philip Wanyonyi, a rights activist, said.This comes even as TransNzoia Governor Patrick Khaemba has also indicated that he will ditch Ford-Kenya for ANC.Reliable sources indicate that the governor has already paid up to be a life member of the ANC p[arty after citing frustrations and with hunt in the Ford-Kenya party.The massive defection could might give Mudavadi a tighter grip on the western vote as preparers for his presidential quest.
