Kiharu MP Irungu Kang&rsquo;ata has denied claims he has dropped out of the race for Murang&rsquo;a senator.Speaking to the Star on Thursday, the first-time legislator and lawyer said the rumours are propaganda by his rivals.&ldquo;It is sad people have resorted to theatrics instead of campaigning and we all meet in the nominations. I am on the ground meeting the people who will make the ultimate decision, so anything else is just hearsay,&rdquo; Kangata said.He added, &ldquo;Those spreading such rumors should know it is not possible for us to withdraw from a race when we are in the last round and almost touching the finishing line as winners.&rdquo;Kang&rsquo;ata launched his manifesto last year. He said he has received calls from top politicians to drop his bid and support incumbent Kembi Gitura.&ldquo;I decided to vie for senator, not because I do not respect Kembi - he is actually my senior and a man of high repute - but I just feel it&rsquo;s right that I take up the mantle to ensure the issues in our county are addressed conclusively,&rdquo; he said. Kang&rsquo;ata is known for his modest lifestyle.
