Bungoma MCAs have panicked after EACC detectives camped at the county assembly to investigate misappropriation of Sh37 million meant for medical cover.The MCAs are suspected of sharing the money among themselves.According to documents seen by the Star, the assembly signed a deal with Jubilee Insurance on August 3, 2016, to provide medical cover to 63 MCAs and 82 staff.But the assembly paid an agent called Marco, prompting Jubilee Insurance to withdraw the cover.Two human rights organisations &ndash; Citizens for Good Governance and Western Human Rights Watch &ndash; then petitioned the EACC to investigate.Clerk John Mosongo yesterday said he has all the documents to show that the deal was above reproach.&ldquo;Yes the EACC officials have been camping here for the past two weeks to investigate the insurance issue and many others. But we can assure you everything we did was [aboveboard],&rdquo; he said.Mosongo said Jubilee Insurance directed the assembly to pay Marco on its behalf. However Marco did not remit the money after it was paid, causing the stalemate, Mosongo said.Some employees told the Star they are turned away at hospitals, an indication they might have been issued with fake medical cards.&ldquo;We suspect foul play. We have been paying cash, despite allegedly being insured,&rdquo; said a member of staff who asked not to be named.The petition by the Citizens for Good states that Marco agency is owned by one of the MCAs and the deal was a conspiracy to siphon the money without insuring the MCAs and staff.On Monday, 38 Trans Nzoia MCAs, speaker and assembly clerk were charged with misappropriation of Sh7 million.
