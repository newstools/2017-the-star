A key politician from the Nyanza region who recently decamped from ODM for Jubilee is a worried man. While he thought that the ground would be receptive to his move in the initial stages, things have changed and the ground is completely shifting allegiance to NASA. He convened a meeting a few days ago at a hotel in the region but after spending a fortune to secure the venue, a number of his supporters who turned up for the meeting shocked him. They told him to his face that they will only back him if he considered rejoining the opposition. "Jubilee is very hard to sell here. In fact, we could have easily elected you if you crossed back to ODM," one of his supporters told him. The politician swiftly promised to make a decision in the next two weeks. Jubilee could soon suffer a body blow.**********Is the NASA strategy of unleashing their plan in small bits deliberate? Sources whisper to Corridors that Jubilee is already concerned that NASA is determined to lock them out from the national discourse, including the news headlines. It is, however, understood that whoever will fly the opposition flag is already known. The idea is to keep Jubilee guessing and the media in a state of permanent excitement. "That way, the public discourse keeps revolving around the opposition luminaries, which analysts believe is very good for any serious political movement. There was excitement around the formation of the Jubilee Party in September 2016. But already, the small parties are complaining about merging with JP, saying they were conned. On Tuesday, the NASA chiefs, led by Raila Odinga, signed their Alliance agreement and at the weekend they were in Eldoret for a major political rally.*********A group of politicians in Nairobi were last week asking themselves why Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero reported "a political matter" to police after the stoning of his car in Kawangware. Corridors has learned that the city boss reported the incident to the Kilimani police station, leading to the arrest of a young man who allegedly led the youths who damaged his car. The man is still in police custody and the issue remains political in a vote-hunt season. The youth have now vowed to stop the governor from setting foot in the area if &ldquo;our leader&rdquo; is not released.**********Still in Nairobi, Governor Evans Kidero's handlers were on Saturday astounded by the cleanliness and orderliness of Eldoret town, when they accompanied their boss to the NASA rally. One of them said: &ldquo;If asked, what are the two most conspicuous features of Eldoret town, I would say the town is very clean and orderly. Either the people of Eldoret are clean, or the county government is working. If asked the same question about Nairobi, I would exercise my constitutional right to remain silent.&rdquo;
