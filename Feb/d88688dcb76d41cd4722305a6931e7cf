Concerns have been raised over the high number of uncollected ID cards in Nairobi, with only six days left to the end of the mass voter registration on February 14.GPO Huduma Centre manager Florence Shambati said over 68,000 IDs haven&rsquo;t been collected in 17 registration centres in the county &mdash; 11 huduma offices and six ID registration centres.&ldquo;We are having some issues with uncollected IDs in Nairobi because very many people are applying but they are not collecting them,&rdquo; Shambati said.She was briefing Governor Evans Kidero when he visited the centre yesterday. Shambati said Huduma services have been devolved to wards and constituencies to make it easier for people to collect the documents, but the turnout is still low.&ldquo;We have introduced Huduma mashinani to reach as many people as possible but the response is still not good. We have also extended our working hours from 5pm to 6pm,&rdquo; Shambati said.Kidero described as alarming the number of uncollected IDs and asked the management of Huduma centres and the National Registration Bureau to devise ways of reaching the owners.&ldquo;You need to extend working hours to 7pm or 8pm and work on Saturday and Sundays, like some banks, to reach as many people,&rdquo; he said.Kidero said the county administration will work with the Huduma Centres and the NRB to ensure the IDs are collected before the end of voter registration. The governor said the county was considering publishing a list of all the uncollected IDs but ruled it out due to security reasons.&ldquo;Publishing the list will give an opportunity to people who might use them for illegal purposes,&rdquo; he said.The figures the IEBC released last week showed 182,265 people have registered in Nairobi. This is, however, below the 50 per cent targeted by the IEBC. Slow pace of issuance of IDs, high number of uncollected document and apathy have been blamed for the low voter registration.
