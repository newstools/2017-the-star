The hyacinth on Lake Victoria is no longer a fisherman&rsquo;s only worry. The Kisumu government now confiscates illegal, small-mesh fishing nets.Fisheries director Jonam Etyang said officers have begun to patrol the lake at night after receiving tips on use of illegal nets. The mesh size for an omena net is 10mm not the 5mm by 6mm used by fishermen.The Nile perch net should be seven inches not the three inch one favoured, while for tilapia farmers should use a net with a mesh size of two inches.&ldquo;The fishermen get their nets from local shops that provide what is in demand and suitable for the fishermen. They do not pay attention to what is recommended by us,&rdquo; Etyang said.He said some fish are netted in breeding grounds, depleting the population. &ldquo;Some fishermen are determined to get their daily supply of fish and will do anything to get it.&rdquo;
