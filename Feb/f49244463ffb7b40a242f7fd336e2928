Nyeri governor aspirant Wahome Gakuru (pictured) has urged the county government to help mobilise residents to get vote cards. Governors in other counties are mobilising voters while nothing is being done in Nyeri, he told journalists on Wednesday. &ldquo;It is shocking that we are in the list of poor performers despite having all the machinery. I&rsquo;m, however, very serious on the ground mobilising voters to ensure President Uhuru Kenyatta garners more votes,&rdquo; Gakuru said.
