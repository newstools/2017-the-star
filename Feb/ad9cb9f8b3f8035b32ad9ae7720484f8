The 2017 SportPesa Premier League season is set to kick off on Saturday after the league managers yesterday released fixtures of the opening weekend.Contrary to recommendation by the Football Kenya Federation (FKF) Licensing Committee that Sofapaka and Muhoroni Youth be omitted from this season&rsquo;s top flight league for failing to meet the licensing requirement, the duo have been included on the roster. Muhoroni are scheduled to take to the field on Sunday away at Western Stima while Sofapaka host Ulinzi Stars three days later. The KPL governing council in their meeting yesterday met and unanimously agreed to support and also enjoin KPL in an immediate and urgent petition by Muhoroni Youth and Sofapaka against their irregular and dubious &lsquo;relegation&rsquo; leaving out Nakumatt, KCB and Vihiga United from their tentative schedule. Further, the governing council adopted the fixtures for the 2017 season for the following 14 KPL teams, which legitimately qualified on sporting merit on the field in 2016. They include&mdash;AFC Leopards, Bandari, Chemelil Sugar, Gor, Kakamega Homeboyz, Mathare United, Muhoroni Youth, Posta Rangers, Sofapaka, Sony Sugar, Thika United, Tusker, Ulinzi Stars and Western Stima alongside the two promoted National Super League&mdash;Nzoia United and Kariobangi Sharks&mdash;which qualified on merit.&ldquo;These fixtures will be reviewed and amended if and when the league expands to 18-teams,&rdquo; read the governing council statementThe council also agreed to appeal to the relevant authorities and judicial bodies on all previous and future FKF decisions which violate Fifa principles/regulations and the FKF-KPL Agreement.New boys Sharks will open the season with a tough away fixture at Bandari while fellow promoted side, Nzoia United will travel to face AFC Leopards on Sunday.Deposed champions Gor Mahia will be away at Kakamega Homeboyz while neighbours Chemelil Sugar and Sony Sugar clash in Kisumu. Mathare United will be at home to Thika United with champions Tusker, who will be flying the country&rsquo;s flag in the CAF champion League taking on Posta Rangers next week on Wednesday.KPL alluded to possible fixture changes should the recommendation by the federation for an18-team league sail through. Nakumatt were one of the initial 15 teams that had been granted the club license to take part in this year&rsquo;s Premier league before later being joined by Thika while Vihiga and KCB were promoted on the recommendation of the club licensing team after Sofapaka and Muhoroni ostensibly failed to meet the licensing threshold on finance, an allegation the respective club chairmen Elly Kalekwa and Moses Adagala have vehemently deniedFixures Saturday February 11Kakamega Homeboyz vs Gor MahiaBandari vs Kariobangi SharksChemelil Sugar vs Sony SugarSunday February 12Mathare United vs Thika UnitedWestern Stima vs Muhoroni Youth AFC Leopards vs Nzoia Sugar Wednesday 15 February Sofapaka vs Ulinzi StarsTusker vs Posta Rangers
