Only three per cent of women in three counties know what causes cervical cancer, a study has indicated.Statistics released by the Lancet Group of Laboratories indicates 97 per cent of women do not know about the causal link between the human papillomavirus (HPV) and cervical cancer. The study was conducted last year in Nairobi, Kisumu and Mombasa counties. A total of 327 women were sampled,most of them married.&ldquo;Not knowing HPV causes cervical cancer is like not knowing HIV causes Aids,&rdquo; Lancet Laboratories group managing editor Ahmed Kalebi said.He said just as HIV testing is done to identify infections before they progress to the stage of immunodefiency, so should HPV be tested before women progress to pre-cancerous and cancer stages. Kalebi said if detected early, it can be treated. HPV is spread sexually and most women are infected at some point. &ldquo;The fact less than five per cent of women know the link between HPV and cervical cancer should be a wake-up call to all stakeholders. Without awareness, it is unlikely women would seek HPV vaccination, for themselves and their daughters. It&rsquo;s also unlikely they will appreciate the value of HPV testing,&rdquo; Kalebi added. Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among Kenyan women, breast cancer is first. Data from the Health ministry shows that 2,454 women are diagnosed annually with cervical cancer, while 1,676 people die from it. Last year, Lancet introduced the Evalyn Brush for cervical cancer screening. The brush is a self-testing kit a woman can use to collect samples herself. She then takes them for laboratory testing.&ldquo;We need to inform and urge women to check themselves for HPV as this enables them to know whether they are at risk of getting cervical cancer or not,&rdquo; Kalebi said. Kenya uses the Pap smear, but HPV testing is more comprehensive.
