Labour Party leader Ababu Namwamba was stopped on Tuesday from carrying out any business on its behalf.The decision by the Political Parties Tribunal followed an application by party member John Makokha.Makokha filed the application through his lawyer Amuga Apondi, saying the Budalang'i MP was still a member of Raila Odinga's ODM party.He cited a ruling in Ababu's favour by the tribunal last week, saying the MP's defence was that he was a member of the Orange party.Read more: Parties tribunal dismisses Ababu's ODM expulsion, upholds Mvurya, Mwaura'sMakokha further said Ababu was not a legitimate member of Labour Party of Kenya.He also annexed minutes of the party's National Executive Council on February 10. Ababu's chairmanship of the meeting infringed upon his rights as a member, he said.Makokha also said in his affidavit that Ababu was illegally trying to form alliances with other parties yet he was not a member of LPK.Tribunal leaders Kyalo Mbobu and Milly Odongo certified as urgent the application filed through a notice of motion on January 27.They temporarily restrained Ababu from acting on behalf of the party saying this would prevent confusion.&ldquo;An interim order is hereby issued to restrain the respondent, by his servants or agents, from acting or purporting to act or holding himself out as member of [LPK] pending the hearing and determination of this application,&rdquo; the tribunal said.The judges also ordered that the party be served with the notice of motion ahead of a hearing on March 9.Mbobu and Odongo further directed that Ababu be served with their decision, and that Makokha file and serve an affidavit explaining his relationship with the party.Ababu relaunched the party in September last year saying he would use it to unite the Luhya community and pursue their interests.He has, for the past two weeks, been embroiled in a tussle with David Makali, who was serving as party secretary general.Makali claimed the MP planned a coup in his absence leading to his removal and replacement with Ole Musei who was the organising secretary .Makali and Ababu are said to have differed when a group led by Ababu opted to work with Jubilee while he insisted on working with the National Super Alliance.A NEC meeting convened by Ababu's team on Monday, to ratify the party's decision to join Jubilee, was aborted.More on this: David Makali kicked out of Ababu's Labour Party over NASA links
