Clinical officers and paramedics in public hospitals in Elgeyo Marakwet yesterday downed their tools over what they said is discrimination in payment of allowances.The more than 10 groups of health staff, including laboratory technicians, pharmacists and public health and medical engineers, said they were left out when the state recently awarded nurses and doctors allowances.They were led by Elgeyo Marakwet Clinical Officers Association secretary general Meshack Chemnjor and his Association of Public Health Officers counterpart Mathew Kore. The health workers held protests in Iten, as patients sought medical attention in private hospitals.Chemnjor said they will not resume duties until the government pays their allowances.He said the clinical officers and paramedics deserved risk, uniform and practice allowances, just like the nurses and doctors.&ldquo;We cannot continue offering services when the government discriminates against some health workers,&rdquo; Chemnjor said.He said the inequalities in remuneration has demoralised other health workers, who did not benefit from the allowances.Kore, who is also the national vice chairman of the Association of Public Health Workers, lashed out at the county government, saying it is dragging its feet on the promotion of health workers.He said the county has never promoted the workers from job group L to M since 2013.Kore said the County Public Service Board has only promoted a few workers, but selectively.&ldquo;Other counties have promoted all their health workers,&rdquo; he said.Efforts by Governor Alex Tolgos to convince the heath workers to resume duty fell on deaf ears.He told the union officials at Iten County Referral Hospital the county government will initiate negotiations to end the stalemate.
