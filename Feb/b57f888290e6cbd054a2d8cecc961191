The value of unclaimed financial assets surrendered to the state in the 2015-16 fiscal year nearly doubled year-on-year, rising 85.32 per cent compared to the previous year, the regulator announced yesterday. The Unclaimed Financial Assets Authority said assets jumped to Sh6.06 billion from Sh3.27 billion. About 96.86 per cent of the assets, an equivalent of Sh5.87 billion of the Sh6.06 billion total value, have been invested in Treasury Bills &ndash; short-term government securities which are repaid with interest after three months to one year. The share of the funds in T-bills has, however, dropped year-on-year from 98.16 per cent or Sh3.20 billion of the Sh3.26 billion submitted in the 2014-15 year. The reduction is linked to increased allocation to cash reserves, which rose more than five-fold to Sh532.01 million from Sh87.11 million to cater for rising claims, UFAA said. The Unclaimed Financial Assets Act 2011 requires banks, insurers, brokerage firms, pension funds and utilities, including mobile money service providers, to surrender cash not claimed for three years to the authority by November 1 of every year. This includes cash in accounts that have been dormant for years, and whose owners cannot be traced as at end of June every year.
