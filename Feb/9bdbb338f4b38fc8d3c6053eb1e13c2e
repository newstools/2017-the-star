For more than 50 years, France and Kenya have engaged in an active and respectful partnership. A partnership whose economic component has been strengthened in the past years, especially as Kenya just attained the status of a middle-income country. It is in this context that I will be paying a visit to Nairobi, today and tomorrow, in order to renew France&rsquo;s commitment to supporting the development of our main partner in East Africa.This commitment is as important to France as it is to the Kenyan economy, which enjoyed a decade of growth, since it is the most important and the most resilient economy in the East African Community.Kenya&rsquo;s economy is first and foremost a turbine for major innovations that are replicated all over the continent, such as in India and Europe, in the case of its famous mobile payment system. The development level of its services makes it a model in the region.Kenya is currently experiencing a rapid urbanization thanks to the development of its middle class as it is developing an entrepreneurship culture. All these factors contribute to reinforcing the country&rsquo;s attractiveness for the French exporters and investors.Kenya is also a regional investment hub which was able to further enhance its attractiveness. It&rsquo;s particularly attractive because of the introduction of favorable measures to foreign participation in Kenyan companies. It&rsquo;s also attractive because of the establishment, in 2015, of a Special Economic Zones system which provides a fiscal, financial and regulatory framework, among the most incentives in sub-Saharan Africa. That is why Kenya recorded the highest increase amongst African countries in the 2016 ranking of the World Bank&rsquo;s Doing Business survey.The outcome of these reforms is clear: it lays in the growing interest of French companies in Kenya, as an investment destination. Between 2013 and 2016, the number of French companies present in Kenya has more than doubled and continues to grow. Finally, Kenya is a democracy which is based, just like France, on a respected and modernized Constitution, a well-functioning Parliamentary system, an overall independent judiciary, a vibrant and diversified press, as well as an advanced devolution thanks to the establishment of 47 counties in 2010, and on an active and enterprising middle-class.Today, I encourage Kenya and France to broaden their economic partnership. This trend has already been started by the French companies which favor this country, as we can observe, as their commercial and industrial headquarters in the region.This is why the further building of our economic relationship must be based on the articulation of our financial support, together with the growing involvement of French companies in the country&rsquo;s priority areas of development.As per now, France is Kenya&rsquo;s second bilateral donor and this engagement is bound to grow further with the increased commitments of the French Development Agency, and the increasing mobilization of the French Treasury&rsquo;s funding mechanisms.In that regard, I call for the reinforcement of the French partnership to mainly focus on the areas of renewable energies, urban development, (water and sanitation, transportation, waste management), a digital economy, education, health and agro-food.The writer is French minister for Economy and finance
