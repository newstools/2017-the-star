The Coast is no longer an opposition stronghold and Jubilee Party will win the majority of positions because of the administration&rsquo;s massive development projects, four officials have said.Jubilee nominated Senators Beth Mugo and Mvita Kisasa, Kilifi North MP Gideon Mung&rsquo;aro and Ganze&rsquo;s Peter Shehe were at the Coast for a voter registration campaign at the weekend.Mugo said, &ldquo;I can confidently say Jubilee has gained momentum. Coast is no longer a Cord zone. We shall share the votes equally.&rdquo;She has been meeting with women and youth groups in the region, urging them to register to vote and elect JP in the August 8 poll.At a youth forum on Saturday, she said the Jubilee administration has invested heavily at the Coast in projects that are transforming residents&rsquo; lives.Mung&rsquo;aro said Jubilee is keen on developing the region, and Kilifi county in particular. He said the state has completed the Kaloleni-Mavueni road and works on the Malindi-Salagate and Mariakani-Bamba roads are progressing well.Mung&rsquo;aro said the national government had also invested in electricity to connect villages.He dismissed opposition claims that it was the right of the Coastal people to benefit from the projects initiated by the government and questioned why the previous regimes did not come up with such initiatives.&ldquo;Since Independence, we have had Jomo Kenyatta, Daniel Moi, Mwai Kibaki and Raila Odinga governments and now it is Uhuru Kenyatta. It&rsquo;s no lie, but he is the only one who initiated developments and is the best President,&rdquo; Mung&rsquo;aro said.
