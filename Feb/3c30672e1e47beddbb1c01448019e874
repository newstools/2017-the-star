Starehe MP Maina Kamanda yesterday urged the Jubilee Party nomination losers to support the winners. He said everyone who supports the party will be hired in the county and national governments.&ldquo;You can even become ward managers or chairmen of various parastatals, but first you must support Jubilee as it&rsquo;s the one that will form the next government because of its popularity,&rdquo; Kamanda said. He spoke at the party&rsquo;s Starehe offices when he met MCA aspirants from six wards.Kamanda said out of nearly 100 of them, only six will be elected but they should not panic as the government will have room for them. He said the party will win the Nairobi governor&rsquo;s seat and thanked the people of Starehe for registering in large numbers
