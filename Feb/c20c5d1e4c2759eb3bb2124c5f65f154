Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi is expected in the country today for a four-day state visit at the invitation of President Uhuru Kenyatta.The two presidents are expected to hold discussions today at State House, Nairobi, where trade between the two countries will be at the centre of discussions. Trade relations between Egypt and Kenya have seen a positive development over the years as a result of both countries membership in Comesa. Available records show the volume of bilateral trade between the two countries in 2008 was around Sh37 billion. Trade data indicates that Egyptian exports to Kenya amounted to Sh15 billion, while imports from Kenya amounted to Sh22 billion, with Sh6 billion of surplus in favour of Kenya. This unprecedented increase in the value of Kenya&rsquo;s exports to Egypt in 2008 is due to the increase of the volume and value of exports of tea to Egypt, which is ranked as the first importer of Kenyan tea. Sisi&rsquo;s advance team arrived in the country on Wednesday alongside five armoured vehicles that he will be using while int he country. Sources said close to 150 Egyptian government security personnel also arrived in the country alongside the advance team. Deputy President William Ruto visited Egypt from on November 15 and 16 and held talks with President Sisi and Prime Minister Sheriff Ismail in Cairo.
