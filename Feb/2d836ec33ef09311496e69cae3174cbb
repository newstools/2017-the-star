Majority leader Aden Duale&rsquo;s insistence in recent days that the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission conduct the ruling party&rsquo;s nominations for the general election should not pass unchallenged.Given the tightness of the procurement timelines, including of polling ICTs and ballot papers, the IEBC should be left alone to do the main event &ndash; the general election. There is a good reason why the &lsquo;I&rsquo; in the IEBC precedes the other letters. It is independent and must not get sidetracked into party or coalition primaries.The IEBC has a gargantuan task to deliver a clean, credible and transparent general election whose outcomes satisfy even the losers.IEBC bosses Wafula Chebukati and Ezra Chiloba and their teams must keep all their attentions and capabilities focused on delivering the freest and fairest general election of the multiparty era begun in 1992.Duale&rsquo;s baiting of the opposition to the effect that their primaries too must be supervised by the IEBC is a redundant sideshow.
