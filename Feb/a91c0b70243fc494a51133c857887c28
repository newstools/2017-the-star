DP William Ruto has acknowledged having a child&nbsp;with another woman and re futed claims that he has not been taking care her. A woman sued Ruto for child support on Thursday, saying she wanted him&nbsp;compelled to support the girl. "My 11-year old child Abby is well catered for, including her education at a private boarding school," he wrote on Twitter on Thursday. The Deputy President asked politicians to keep off his affairs and concentrate on more important issues. " Politicians and busybodies should keep off," he said. "For the record I did find Abby's mother a 90k-a-month job, 40k monthly upkeep ever since. She went ahead to get her own 3 other kids though," he added later in the day.&nbsp; The woman indicated in her court documents that she&nbsp;met Ruto in 2005 while studying at Moi University.&nbsp; She said, through lawyer Gitobu Imanyara, that her child was born on March 6, 2006 at Mediheal Hospital. "The respondent has failed to provide the minor with adequate and basic necessities such as good health, food, school fees, clothing, shelter and medication," she said.Read: Woman sues DP William Ruto for child neglect
