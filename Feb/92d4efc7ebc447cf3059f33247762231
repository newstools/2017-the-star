Cord leader Raila Odinga yesterday endorsed ODM member Nassir Dolal to run for Garissa Township MP, dealing a blow to Wiper deputy party leader Farah Maalim&rsquo;s bid for the post.On June 4 last year, Raila had asked Dolal to drop his bid in favour of Maalim, who was then in ODM. But Maalim later ditched ODM for Wiper. Both parties are members of the Cord coalition.National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale is the current MP.At the rally on the outskirts of Garissa town yesterday, Dolal said he is sure he will win because ODM enjoys massive support in the area.&ldquo;Our party leader prevailed upon me to step down in favour of Farah of which I accepted. This is despite me being the strongest candidate. But he decided to betray and backstab us by moving to Wiper without even informing us,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;It is for this reason that I will offer myself to the people of Garissa for election come August 8. It is a decision that I am not making on my own, but after consulting my party leadership and my supporters.&rdquo;Both Dolal and Maalim come from the same Aulyhan clan.Dolal narrowly lost to Duale in 2013 with less than 1,500 votes.If Maalim and Dolal run for MP, it could give Duale an advantage over them. DUale comes from the Abduwak clan.Raila urged residents to support ODM candidates and vote for them in forthcoming polls.Some political analysts and leaders say Maalim may have joined Wiper to get votes from the huge Kamba community in Garissa.Sources told the Star that his move to Wiper did not please Raila.Raila also endorsed ODM's Fatuma Kinsi to run for Garissa woman representative against incumbent Shukran Gure (Wiper).
