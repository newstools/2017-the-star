The Kenya National Union of Teachers, Garissa county branch, on Monday accused the police in Masalani of allegedly covering up on their colleagues, who assaulted a head teacher and a watchman last week.Garissa branch Knut secretary general Abdirizak Hussein said one week after the incident occurred, there has not been any progress in having those culpable arrested and charged. &ldquo;It is unfortunate that nothing has been done to the four police officers who assaulted Gababa head teacher Abdulatif Kosar and the school&rsquo;s watchman one week after filing an official complain at the Masalani police station under OB number 18/22/02/2017. We suspect these officers are covering up for their colleagues,&rdquo; he told the Star on the phone yesterday. Hussein said that is impunity by the same officers who should protect Kenyans. He called on the Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet to immediately intervene and ensure the rogue officers are punished in accordance with the law.
