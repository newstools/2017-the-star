Siaya police officers have raised fears that they have become the primary targets of criminals in the county.Those who spoke to the Star on condition of anonymity said they have become "endangered species" because they have thwarted many crimes.They said they cannot visit parts of the county without guns, whether during the day or at night.An officer was killed last week after the vehicle he was in rolled several times as he headed to Ulafu.The policeman was going to the location to rescue four colleagues who had been detained in a bar at Ulafu centre.The three men and one woman had reportedly been told that they would be attending a party.But they found a gang armed with clubs and blunt objects and were beaten, but managed to escape after two hours.Other officers were attacked at Anyiko in Gem, and their camp and houses razed, by residents angered by the death of a local.They said they believed Erick Ouma was killed at Anyiko police cell but county police boss Beatrice Gachagwa said the suspect died at Yala hospital.Gachagwa said Ouma was arrested for being drunk and disorderly and fell sick at the cells. But residents said he was sick before he was arrested.The attack has forced the police boss to withdraw officers from the station.Several officers at Anyiko AP camp reported that members of the public had put them on notice following Ouma's death.Siaya county commissioner Josephine Onunga asked residents to work with police to maintain security.Onunga, who spoke in her office on Wednesday, said they should follow proper channels when they have complaints.The commissioner warned that matters could get worse in the run-up to the August 8 general election. She cautioned politicians against issuing inflammatory remarks, saying they should focus on development.In May last year, police officers in the county shot and killed anti-IEBC protesters, sparking protests by residents.Gachagwa said police used live bullets after they ran out of blank bullets and teargas.The officers were transferred, sources saying residents and relatives of the deceased had threatened revenge.Women in the county then threatened to strip naked to protest against police brutality towards the demonstrators.Esther Omondi, ODM's Gem sub-branch women&rsquo;s leader, condemned police shootings and killings and said they would not tolerate more cases.They appealed to the police not to provoke peaceful protesters.In June that year, Siaya church leaders organised a three-day prayer meeting to reconcile police and residents.More on this: Siaya women dare to strip naked over police brutalityAlso read: Church wants Siaya residents to forgive police for brutality
