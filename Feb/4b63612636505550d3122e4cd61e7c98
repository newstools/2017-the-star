Three wards in Migori county are yet to receive bursary cash because of political differences between MCAs and Governor Okoth Obado.Sources in Obado&rsquo;s office said the MCAs who have disagreed with Obado are Richard Solo (North Kamagambo), Joshua Ongoma (East Kamagambo) and Ronald Asiga (Wasimbete).Speaking to the press at St Jonathan Primary School in South Kamagambo ward, Rongo constituency, on Monday, Ongoma said the differences are hurting innocent children. &ldquo;Parents in my ward have been asking why we are yet to receive any bursaries, yet other areas have them/ I only tell them mine has delayed because of political differences with the governor,&rdquo; Ongoma said.He said MCAs who have differed with Obado have been sidelined in bursaries and other development projects. &ldquo;We might have political differences with the governor, but sadly, he has let this hurt our people, who are innocent and voted for him,&rdquo; Ongoma said.Last week on Wednesday, some MCAs criticised a speech Obado delivered during the opening of the assembly on Tuesday. The governor listed bursaries and development projects as his achievements.
