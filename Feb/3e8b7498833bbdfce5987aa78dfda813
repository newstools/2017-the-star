The price for land in Nairobi suburbs increased by 0.8 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2016, a survey by HassConsult shows, the lowest growth in eight years.The slight expansion is mainly attributed to the Banking (Amendment) Act, 2016, enforced on September 14 last year after President Uhuru Kenyatta signed it into law on August 24. The rate cap is believed to have subdued performance resulting in slow growth in credit.&ldquo;The drop in asking prices is as a result of the sluggish macro-economic environment that has witnessed corporate layoffs and a slow uptake of credit despite the introduction of the interest rate cap,&rdquo; HassConsult head of research and marketing Sakina Hassanali said in Nairobi yesterday.She said mortgage uptake stood at one per cent after the amendments, as commercial banks have been reluctant to lend to borrowers.This, she said, is increasingly driving developers in Nairobi and its environs to seek international financiers to fund their projects.&ldquo;The interest rate cap was supposed to capitalise lending but it has failed to live up to expectations. Commercial banks are more conservative in their lending,&rdquo; Hassanali said.The quarterly report shows land in Upper Hill remained the most expensive with asking price growing 5.1 per cent annually to reach Sh537.1 million an acre.Kilimani was second with asking price for an acre at Sh427.5 million, followed by Parklands at Sh408 million.An acre in Westlands was selling at Sh404.8 million as of December 2016, while Kileleshwa, the fifth most expensive area to buy land, an acre was costing an average Sh288.7 million.For the quarter under review, Gigiri was the best performing Nairobi suburb with the average asking price increasing by 3.13 per cent to an average Sh224.8 million an acre from Sh217.9 million in quarter three.The survey shows satellite towns performed better with land prices rising by an average of 2.3 per cent between October and December.Ruaka remained the most expensive satellite town with an average value of Sh77.8 million an acre up from Sh74.7 million during the previous quarter.
