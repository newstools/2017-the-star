The push by MPs to regulate the lucrative betting and gaming industry took a new twist yesterday after the government submitted to the House a parallel draft bill. Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery tabled the bill before the committee on Labour and Social Welfare. Minority leader Jakoyo Midiwo had already introduced another bill earlier. Named the Gaming Bill, the proposed law recommends tough fines on industry players who allow underage individuals to participate in gambling. &ldquo; A person who bets with a young person commits an offence and shall upon conviction be liable to a fine not exceeding Sh500,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year or both,&rdquo; reads the bill in part. A similar punishment is prescribed for people who sell lottery tickets to underage people.
