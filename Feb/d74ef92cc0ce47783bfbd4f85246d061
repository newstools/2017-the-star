She said leaders should ensure no more deaths are reported. Nyokabi spoke in Othaya, Nyeri county, on Monday. She said coordination of the countries involved is paramount.Nyokabi, however, praised the soldiers for repulsing al Shabaab after the attack at Kulbiyow, saying not as many soldiers were lost as in the El Adde attack on January 15 last year. No official number was issued for the death toll in El Adde.&ldquo;The compensation of the families affected should also be looked into since many families are left without bread winners. Counselling should also be conducted well,&rdquo; the woman rep said.
