Anne said she met Wanjohi three years ago at a Youth camp.&ldquo;We used to fellowship at the ELIM Church, but in different congregations in Nyahururu and Kinangop,&rdquo; she said.Wanjohi, a class eight dropout and the fifth-born in a family of eight, moved to Nairobi from Kinangop later after their maiden meet.He said, &ldquo;I am now hopeful of starting an electronics shop to sustain my young family.&rdquo; The two would communicate on the phone. &ldquo;I went to church as usual on our wedding day. I had Sh200 in my pocket,&rdquo; Wanjohi said. &ldquo;I waited for the praise and worship session to end and dashed to a Malimali shop, where I bought my rings at Sh100,&rdquo; Wilson said. He said he spent the remaining money on their first supper as a married couple. Last week, Diamond Properties promised them a Sh500,000 eighth-acre plot with a Sh320,000 greenhouse and capsicum crop in Isinya, Kajiado county.
