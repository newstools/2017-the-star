Former Nacada chairman John Mututho instigated the removal and prosecution of the anti-drugs agency CEO William Okedi.A court heard on Wednesday that it was the former Naivasha MP who ordered EACC to probe Okedi for wrongdoing at the agency.Okedi's representative Charles Agwara told the Anti-Corruption Court that the investigations and subsequent prosecution were in bad faith.He said the probe was done in disregard of the provisions of the law, adding that they were at the behest of Mututho who wanted the CEO removed."Upon appointment of Mututho to Nacada, he wrote letters to th DCI and EACC seeking the prosecution of the CEO," Agwara said in court.Okedi moved to the High court to stop his prosecution at a magistrates court. He said before Justice Hedwing Ongudi that Mututho attempted to compromise the Office of the Auditor General to have the CEO removed but failed. "He went on to suspend the CEO and immediately wrote a letter to EACC dated June 25, 2015 making false complaints about the CEO," Agwara argued.The lawyer said Motutho's actions amounted to a witch hunt, saying Okedi's prosecution demonstrated bias on the part of EACC."This is about the bad blood between the accused and his former chairman," Agwara said.Read: Nacada&rsquo;s Okedi, Mwikali charged with violating procurement lawsAlso read: Suspended Nacada boss William Okedi fails to stop prosecution over corruptionHe added that it was Okedi who sought for investigations into the loss of Sh67 million from the anti-drugs agency."The public procurement oversight board (PPOB), National Treasury and Attorney General had recommended investigations into the issues raised by the CEO," Agwara said."...but the same has never been acted upon and instead EACC went with falsehoods from the former chairman to have the applicant prosecuted," he said.Okedi has been accused of failing to comply with procurement rules in hiring a consultant to manage the Alcoholic Drinks Control Fund set aside for civil society organisations.The judge heard that PPOB did recommend the prosecution of those involved in Sh 67 million fraud to be charged.Agwara said that Okedi was charged on September 7, 2016 - being the same day that EACC wrote a letter to Mututho asking him to suspend the CEO. The lawyer asked the court to consider the procedure involved in removing and charging Okedi.He also wants the court to find that there was malice, bad faith and have the case against the ex-CEO terminated. Ongudi said the matter will be ruled on March 15, 2017.
