Nyandarua woman representative Wanjiku Muhia has said aspirant Faith Gitau is only seeking to unseat her out of spite.She said, &ldquo;The main contestants have dropped their bid for the seat in my favour after seeing my good work. But there is one radical who I would say is driven by jealousy. The only woman who says no work has been done.&rdquo;Muhia said Gitau has been sponsoring projects in her Kinagop stronghold to win votes. She spoke in Kieni, Ol Kalou, after donating a tent, sufurias and issuing Sh280,000 bursary cheques.Muhia said Gitau and anyone else interested in her seat should wait for 2022. &ldquo;For now, I am setting the standard against which all those who come after me will be rated. Tell that woman we aim high,&rdquo; she saidMuhia said that instead of telling the people what she can do for them, Gitau is &ldquo;spreading lies&rdquo; about what has not been done. &ldquo;Instead of investing her money and energy into researching on what can benefit Nyandarua, she is doing research on how to make me fail,&rdquo; she said.Gitau said Muhia should seek reelection by telling the people what she has done, and &ldquo;leave my name out of her campaigns&rdquo;.
