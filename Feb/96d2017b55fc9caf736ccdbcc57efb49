Bungoma politician Moses Nandalwe has said Luhyas will vote for NASA regardless of who its flagbearer is.He rubbished Bumula MP Boniface Otsiula&rsquo;s claim that Luhyas will vote for JP in the August 8 poll if Raila Odinga is the candidate. Nandalwe on Saturday said Otsiula speaks for himself as he does not represent the views of Western residents because he lacks the mandate and authority. On Thursday, Otsiula said Luhyas will not vote for Raila a third time after they supported him at the 2007 and 2013 polls. Otsiula said its Raila&rsquo;s turn to support a Luhya candidate.The MP said Luhyas will only vote for NASA if either Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula or Amani leader Musalia Mudavdi is the flagbearer. But speaking to the Star on the phone Nandalwe said Luhyas have an official spokesperson, and he is not Otsiula. He said only Mudavadi is mandated to speak for the community.
