Trans Nzoia county assembly clerk Ainea Indakwa has been suspended a week after he was charged with graft. The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission recommended that he, speaker David Sifuna and 38 MCAs arrested and charged with abuse of office, be relieved of their duties. &ldquo;The law requires that they step aside until the case against them is finalised,&rdquo; said EACC deputy director Enock Otiko.Indakwa is accused of taking allowances to travel to Murang&rsquo;a for seven days on official duty, but he travelled for only one day.The EACC has also opened investigations into nepotism in the assembly. MCAs and top officials at the assembly are accused of hiring their relatives, a scam that costs the assembly millions of shillings monthly. The EACC has already written to the assembly demanding all details on staffing.The assembly&rsquo;s top officials are likely to face fresh charges of abuse of office.Some MCAs faced hostility at a Jubilee Party meeting, where residents refused to be addressed by the leaders charged with graft. The MCAs were booed and heckled.
