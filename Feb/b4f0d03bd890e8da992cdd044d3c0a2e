Saboti MP David wafula has told his opponents to brace for a tough race both in nominations and on the ballot on August 7. Wafula will face his 2013 rival Jonus Kuko and high school teacher John Makete in the Jubilee nominations. Wafula said his experience in politics and his development record in the constituency gives him a better chance of being reelected. Speaking to the Star in Kitale on Saturday, the MP said he is well prepared to defeat all his opponents.In 2013, Wafula, who was little known, stood on the New-Ford Kenya ticket. Others who are on the race are Joseph Pepela, Protus Chemonges, William Nangulu, Robert Makona and Caleb Amisi. Makona and Amisi were on the ballot in 2013 but lost to Wafula. Wafula will base his reelection campaign on improving security especially in Gitwamba and Muroki where a number of people were killed due to insecurity a few months after taking over as member of Parliament.He has also constructed schools and awarded bursaries without biasness. He supports the reelection of President uhuru and his deputy William Ruto. Unconfirmed sources say Ruto prefers the MP over others as he has been obedient to him and his jubilee party. His opponents however say he is not active in parliament.
