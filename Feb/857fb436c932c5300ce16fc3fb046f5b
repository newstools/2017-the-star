Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto has criticised MPs for proposing a Sh320 billion cut in allocations to the counties.&ldquo;While the counties are pushing for more funds, Jubilee is using Parliament to slash development funds,&rdquo; he said. Rutto spoke on Sunday during a CCM party meeting in Kericho county. Former Health minister and Bureti MP aspirant Paul Sang was present.Rutto said devolution could lose meaning if the national government does not allocate at least 45 per cent of funds from the national kitty to the counties.He said the slash will hurt plans by the counties to build more roads and start water projects.&ldquo;More than 50 years after Independence, most citizens still live in poverty because of rampant corruption by former and current regimes,&rdquo; Rutto said. He said CCM will field candidates for MCA, MP, woman representative, senator and governor in most counties in Rift Valley and Northern Kenya. Rutto expressed confidence he will recapture his seat. He said he is not scared of the &ldquo;Jubilee euphoria&rdquo; sweeping across the Rift Valley.Rutto urged the Kalenjin community not to focus only on JP, but consider joining other parties.He said CCM is a national party, and should not be taken to be a Kalenjin outfit out to fight JP in the Rift Valley.&ldquo;We have members from all ethnic communities and we have opened offices in more than 30 counties,&rdquo; Rutto said.Sang urged Jubilee to ensure the polls are free and fair. He accused the government of rigging him out of the Kericho senator by-election last year.
