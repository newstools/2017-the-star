NASA has nothing personal against President Uhuru Kenyatta, but does have a problem with his poor leadership, two leaders have said.They are Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka and Ford Kenya&rsquo;s Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula. The two leaders visited Embu county on Thursday. The county is a Jubilee stronghold and the two chose their words carefully to avoid being booed.Kalonzo said he is not an enemy of the President, but does not condone the &ldquo;tribalism and mega corruption&rdquo; in the Jubilee government.He said, &ldquo;Uhuru&rsquo;s government has torn the nation apart because of entrenching tribalism. People do not see each other as brothers and sisters, but as enemies.&rdquo;Kalonzo said NASA seeks to create unity and promote development.He told the Embu people to avoid grouping into the Gema outfit.Wetang&rsquo;ula said he does not support tribalism.He urged Uhuru to be tolerant and accept criticism.Wetang&rsquo;ula said he will support whoever is picked as the NASA presidential flagbearer. He expressed confidence NASA will win the election.
