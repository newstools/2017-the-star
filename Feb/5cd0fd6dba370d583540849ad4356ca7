Treasury has bowed to pressure from Parliament to form a team to determine the lawmakers' gratuity amounting to millions of shillings each as their term lapses.The Parliamentary Service Commission, House committee chairpersons, Treasury and SRC bosses on Tuesday resolved to form the team in a heated closed-door meeting at Parliament Buildings.Treasury CS Henry Rotich said MPs are "concerned about their gratuity" as their five-year term comes to an end, hence pushing to have the money set aside.The Constitution allows the 416 MPs both in Senate and National Assembly to pocket Sh11,011,200 each as gratuity for their service once their term ends on election day.The move to form the team is a clear indicator that they are protesting a total sum of Sh4.58 billion to be withdrawn from public coffers.The move to form a team to look into their reward package is a clear indicator that they are dissatisfied by the sum.Read: Fat gratuity for MPs but no cash for docs?"There are issues MPs are concerned about in terms of gratuity for the end of their term. They have been throwing figures here and there on the sum they want but we have formed a team to look into it. We will meet again on Tuesday next week to look into it," Rotich said.Although Parliament will dissolve on June 5 for August 8 general elections, each MPs will pocket Sh1.09 million in salary for two months with no work. Majority Leader Aden Duale last month assured members that they will serve up to August 7, a day to the elections. He based his argument on a constitutional provision.In the past, Parliament was dissolved 60 days ahead of the polls but the 2010 Constitution says Parliament's term runs to the day of the next election."Members will get their salaries and allowances, that is a guarantee I can give this House," Duale said while moving the motion to adopt the calendar.Rotich maintained that additional budget by Parliament and ministries cannot be met and that Treasury has been forced to slash their requests in Supplementary Budget to fund emerging areas of priority to address the looming drought, doctors and lectures' strikes."Budget cuts is done all over the world. When I tell them we cut to finance emerging priority areas, they complain and say I should reinstate the budgets. First, I don't know where to raise the money. I cannot raise taxes because I have to make changes to the Finance Bill and if we go borrowing, you (media) will be reporting how the national debt continue rising," he said.
