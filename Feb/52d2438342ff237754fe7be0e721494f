Children can get stressed or start to panic when they&rsquo;re separated from their parents.Now scientists have found the digital generation are developing similar feelings &ndash; for their phones.Youngsters are becoming so devoted to their devices that they are exhibiting the type of attachment behaviours usually reserved for a child&rsquo;s interactions with their parents.Researchers from the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and Eotvos Lorand University in Budapest conducted experiments on 87 smartphone owners aged between 18 and 26.Each participant individually was shown to a room, empty apart from a laptop on a desk and chair and some everyday items including newspapers, a cuddly toy and a beanbag seat.Attached to heart monitors, they were given a simple computerised maths test to complete with assistance from the calculator on their phone.Before being presented with a second set of questions, half were told to switch off their mobiles but keep them close by while the rest had them removed and placed in a cupboard in a corner of the room.Some were given different smartphones to help them while other were handed calculators.After finishing the test, they were given a couple of minutes to while away the time - with their movements secretly filmed &ndash; before being asked to complete a series of word games and a questionnaire about their attachment to their mobile.Analysis showed that those separated from their phones were more likely to display heartbeat patterns often associated with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.During the short break, three quarters of those left without a mobile exhibited displacement behaviour, such as fidgeting and scratching, which are telltale signs of stress and 20 per cent were drawn towards the cupboard.Among those allowed to keep their devices, the figures were 47 per cent and 0 per cent respectively.However, the effects tended to be moderated where participants had been given a different phone.Questionnaire responses elicited evidence that mobiles are used to relieve tension and impart feelings of confidence and security.The study &ndash; in the journal Computers And Human Behaviour &ndash; states: &lsquo;We are in the middle of a nascent digital culture, with children being born into the world of smart devices. This age group was chosen because they are considered to be &ldquo;cell phone natives&rdquo;.&lsquo;The results support that humans form attachment toward their mobile: they seek the proximity of the mobile and show stress response upon separation.&lsquo;Separated individuals had different heart rate responses compared to unseparated participants. Furthermore, separated participants tried to repair proximity to their mobile.&lsquo;They approached the cupboard where their mobile was placed more frequently than unseparated participants.&lsquo;Interestingly, the presence of an unfamiliar mobile decreased the effects of separation from their own mobile, similarly to the calming effect of a stranger on children who are separated from the caregiver.&lsquo;Naturally, adults have a higher tolerance of separation from attachment figures and a higher acceptance of other social partners.
