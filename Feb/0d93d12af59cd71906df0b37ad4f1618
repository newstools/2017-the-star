Kenya&rsquo;s Ambassador to the UN-Habitat Sam Ongeri is set to ditch Jubilee for ODM. The long-serving minister will seek the ODM ticket to run for the Kisii senator seat.He will be received by ODM leader Raila Odinga on Monday in Nairobi, according to a source. Yesterday, Ongeri did not pick our calls or reply to SMSs for comment.Ongeri has already paid an application fee of Sh250,000 and Sh20,000 life membership fee. He sent an ally to pay the fees at Orange House on Wednesday.Last year, Ongeri backed Governor James Ongwae&rsquo;s reelection and criticised Senator Chris Obure, who is seeking to unseat Ongwae.Ongeri&rsquo;s move is seen as a game changer in the Kisii political landscape. He will bank on his development record in the county.The ambassador may have decided to ditch the ruling coalition after he was left out of President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s campaign team.Former CIC chairman Charles Nyachae, Deputy Governor Joash Maangi and Albert Nyaundi, who will be Obure&rsquo;s running mate, were named to the team.Ongeri will face former South Mugirango MP Omingo Magara of PDP, Nyachae and former nominated MP George Nyamweya.Nyachae, a newcomer to politics, wants to assume his father&rsquo;s mantle, former Cabinet minster Simon Nyachae, who quit active politics.But Kisii county Jubilee interim secretary Sam Nyangweso said Ongeri should have remained in Jubilee and faced Nyachae in the nominations.&ldquo;As much as it is his democratic right to join ODM, he should not have joined the opposition because he has a history of serving in government,&rdquo; Nyangweso said.In the March 4, 2013, general election Obure emerged winner with 120,351 votes, while Ongeri came second with 106,325 votes on the TNA ticket.Omingo Magara of People&rsquo;s Democratic Party finished third with 100,754 votes. He went to court to challenge Obure&rsquo;s election, but lost.Magara has declared that he will run for the seat again on August 8. He said PDP will not support NASA or the Jubilee Party.&ldquo;We are truly independent and can create our own identity. We must not be an appendage of any party. I&rsquo;m building an unbeatable team in Kisii and Nyamira counties,&rdquo; Magara said.
