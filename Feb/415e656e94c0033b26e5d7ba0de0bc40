NASA technical team will retreat to a secret location to hammer out rules on how to select the joint presidential candidate.Despite signing a binding alliance agreement yesterday &mdash; and depositing it with the Registrar of Political Parties &mdash; the coalition gave no indication of its joint flagbearer.It is understood that not naming the candidate is a strategic decision, so Jubilee is unable to develop a strategy against that flagbearer.Leaders say that on March 31 they will name the person to face President Uhuru Kenyatta in August."Many of our critics believed we would not be here, united with a common agenda, but we have managed and we are moving ahead for the good of Kenyans," ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi to a small celebration at NASA offices.It is significant NASA leaders have chosen the symbolic Rift Valley for their first rally because much of it is perceived as a Jubilee stronghold, though the opposition has made major inroads.Read: 'Desperate' Jubilee behind fake script naming Kalonzo Nasa flag bearer - ODMExpert comment: Media should get it right about NASAThe alliance brings together the Raila Odinga's ODM, Kalonzo Musyoka's Wiper party, Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula's Ford Kenya and Mudavadi&rsquo;s Amani National Congress.This is not the first time opposition parties have joined hands to dislodge the ruling party.In 2002 the opposition came together as Narc and kicked out the independence party Kanu. In 2013 the Jubilee coalition defeated Cord.While NASA celebrated what it called Kenya's final liberation, the Jubilee Party heaped scorn on endeavour.Yesterday, Ruto dismissed NASA's agreement and plans, saying the opposition has nothing new to offer.&ldquo;Kenyans were told to wait for a major announcement from NASA leaders but that announcement has turned to be about sharing non-existent positions, like chief minister,&rdquo; Ruto said in Kilifi.&ldquo;The difference between the opposition and Jubilee is like day and night. What is important for them is creating positions for themselves, while our focus is development," Ruto said.While formalising the new alliance, the opposition leaders did not unveil any power-sharing agreement.Political analysts say that if the opposition manages to remain united, it will pose a formidable challenge to Jubilee.The just-concluded voter registration shows the opposition and Jubilee neck and neck.Jubilee sources who were close to Narc negotiations rubbished the agreement and its impact.they said NASA is trying to recreate Narc, yet falling short of creating a unified coalition to face off with Jubilee."How does NASA leadership sell a united front while individual and separate aspirants at different levels of senator, governor, MP, MCA tear each other apart as they compete for votes?" one asked."In the agreement, there is no mention of what happens to the third and fourth principals of NASA who lose out on the top tow positions. How do they sell themselves to their core zones?"NASA's agreement says that if three of the four parties leave, the agreement is null and void and the coalition will stand dissolved.At first the coalition had wanted to lock in all four affiliates.The agreement sets out NASA's structure:The highest body is the Summit comprised of the four principals.The second highest is the National Coordinating Committee, with equal numbers from each of the four parties; it can be expanded.There are also County Coordinating Committees, Coalition Parliamentary and County Assemblies Groups and the General Assembly, which will meet once a year.The agreement states that all executive positions in a future government, leadership in the Senate and National Assembly and in the counties will be shared equally and equitably.Constitutional and independent offices will not be shared, such as Controller of Budget, Auditor General, DPP, Ombudsman, among others.The appointments will factor in parties&rsquo; performance, portfolio balance, equity and whether candidates are members of founding parties.The deal has seven pillars: national reconciliation and healing; resolving historical injustices; equality for women, youth, persons with disabilities and disadvantaged communities and groups; strengthening devolution; transforming; realise social and economic rights; and eradicating poverty and unemployment&ldquo;The principals will also sign a code of ethics to take moral and political responsibilities in their respective offices to tame corruption, and if anyone fails, then he is dismissed so that we can stop corruption,&rdquo; Raila said.NASA officials will not conduct any business with the government, directly or indirectly.&ldquo;It is a long journey that we started together as a team but we are confident to achieve together. It is not about us, but our nation as Kenyans,&rdquo; Mudavadi said.Wetang'ula said the Jubilee administration&rsquo;s refusal to implement the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission report reflects the difficulties the country has in acknowledging, confronting and resolving historical injustices.&ldquo;We commit to put in place a mechanism that addresses all the grievances that Kenyans feel have been inflicted on them. It is not for the state to set the boundaries and limits of people&rsquo;s grievances as we have done in the past, including in the TJRC report,&rdquo; the Bungoma senator said.Kalonzo warned the IEBC to take the August election seriously.&ldquo;Last time more than two million votes were rigged to allow President Uhuru Kenyatta win. This time we are working around the clock, and the IEBC chair must be open,&rdquo; Kalonzo said.Kalonzo said this was the last and final liberation that will instil the spirit of nationalism and brotherhood.&ldquo;We are guided by the principle of good faith. We hope Kenyans are going to walk with us,&rdquo; he said.Following the signing ceremony, the secretaries general of the constituent parties were to deposit the agreement with the Registrar of Political Parties.Kanu secretary general Nick Salat was nowhere to be seen, despite his visibility at the inception of the alliance
