Businessman Bundotich Kiprop, popularly known as Buzeki, says he will not drop his bid for Uasin Gishu governor.&ldquo;I am in this race to the end and people of Uasin Gishu will decide at the end,&rdquo; he said.Governor Jackson Mandago, who wants to run for reelection, had asked Buzeki to run in 2022 instead.The businessman has also denied claims he is planning to name his running mate from the populous Kikuyu community. &ldquo;I am working with all communities in Uasin Gishu but I will name my running mate from the Nandi community and give all other residents other opportunities after we win,&rdquo; Buzeki said on Monday in Kesses.There had been claims that Buzeki was to pick Huruma MCA Peter Chomba as his running mate.Buzeki is from the Keiyo community, the second most populous Kalenjin sub-tribe after the Nandi.Calls to wait for 2022Last week, Mandago visited Buzeki&rsquo;s home area in Ainabkoi subcounty and urged residents to convince the businessman to drop his bid this year and run for governor in 2022.Buzeki and former Registrar of the Judiciary Gladys Shollei have ignored attempts by elders to block them from running for top seats in Uasin Gishu.The two intensified their campaigns with a series of meetings, and rejected a plan by the elders to stop Buzeki from running for governor and Shollei for woman representative.Shollei campaigned on the streets of Eldoret as Buzeki met delegations of supporters.More than 1,000 opinion leaders from the county met in Eldoret and endorsed Buzeki and all other political leaders to contest for various posts.Council of Imams and Preachers of Kenya Rift Valley chairman Abubakar Bini said the elders were wrong in making that political decision.Sharing out posts undemocraticOpinion leaders led by Daniel Matelong said a proposal by elders to share out political seats is undemocratic and unconstitutional, and amounts to political fraud.&ldquo;In fact the elders should keep off, instead of plotting confusion in our democratic rights. We have to elect leaders of our choice,&rdquo; he said.The elders, led by Maj (Rtd) John Seii last week announced that the governor will come from Eldoret North, the senator from Eldoret East and woman representative from Eldoret South.&ldquo;This is to ensure these areas are equally represented in top leadership positions in the county,&rdquo; he said.Matelong and the group of opinion leaders said the Constitution does not allow the Kalenjin Council of Elders or any other group to dictate how political leaders should be elected.Bini also dismissed the elders&rsquo; formula, saying it will encourage tribalism and division among the Kalenjin community.
