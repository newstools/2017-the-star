Imperial Bank shareholders and depositors are anxiously waiting for a decision on the pending 40 per cent payout as the receivership period ends in two months.The Central Bank of Kenya and the Kenya Depositors Insurance Corporation have not agreed on the amount after the two institutions failed to initiate recovery efforts.The CBK appointed the KDIC as IBL's receiver manager on October 13, 2015, after the bank collapsed over fraud claims. The regulator extended the receivership period for six months from October 13, 2016.As the April 13, 2017, receivership mandate expiry date draws nearer, shareholders and depositors are still in the dark on what the CBK and the KDIC are planning. The KDIC, the bank depositors' insurer, will make an independent decision about the bank's assets after April 13.The shareholders and depositors want to know how the KDIC has managed the bank for the last 15 months, especially after an announcement was made of a 40 per cent payout through NIC Bank.In June last year, the CBK appointed NIC Bank the asset and liability consultant for IBL to take charge of compensating depositors of the collapsed lender.The court has twice stopped the sale of IBL assets, and it is unclear how the KDIC intends to make the payout without selling the bank's assets.The CBK has left IBL with the option of liquidation after rejecting the shareholders' offer to inject Sh10 billion to stabilise the collapsed bank in the initial stages.According to the court's ruling on the judicial review case, liquidating the bank is technically and legally impossible unless the KDIC and the CBK sit down with the shareholders and agree on the best solution.The depositors say it is not clear to date what IBL's value was on October 12, 2015, and they do not know the current value, yet this is crucial in the event of capital injection, or for discussion with any potential buyer."For capital injection conversation to commence, any potential buyer including the current shareholders, will need to carry out due diligence as in the case of Chase Bank. The due diligence would reveal the bank's current state of affairs. From this, any potential buyer, even if buying the bank at the expected outrageous discount, will be able to tell how much money is needed to resuscitate the collapsed bank, or if they are throwing good money into a black hole," the shareholders say.The June 2015 IBL financial statement shows there are more than Sh52 billion deposits with a loan book of Sh40 billion, therefore the bank had Sh12 billion of liquidity.The first Sh1 million payout to accountholders amounted to Sh8.6 billion, by CBK's calculations. The second Sh1.5 million to the remaining depositors amounted to Sh11 billion, while consulting fees to the auditors FTI Consulting is between Sh1.5 billion and Sh2 billion. FTI is an American firm which was hired to conduct forensic audit of the collapsed bank's accounts.The CBK is on record saying IBL had Sh87 billion deposits when the bank collapsed, meaning the bank had more money than was disclosed in the CBK approved published financial statement on June 4, 2015, four months before it was placed under receivership.The 10 per cent third payout to the remaining accountholders has not been established yet.
