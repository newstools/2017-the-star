I welcome the decision by Kanu to back President Kenyatta&rsquo;s reelection, but at the same time fault the party for deciding to field aspirants for all other elective seats.Kanu had no option but to support Uhuru and Deputy President William Ruto because they are popular in the Rift Valley region.Despite the support, Kanu will not win seats against Jubilee in Rift Valley and the party should make up its mind to fully back Jubilee candidates.Rift Valley is a Jubilee stronghold and although we need support from all Kenyans, Kanu should have decided to back Jubilee fully.Kanu and other parties like CCM of Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto should not expect to reap from any fallout in Jubilee after the nominations because there would be no fallout.We in Jubilee believe that we will have very fair nominations to the satisfaction of all aspirants and those who will lose out will stand to back the winnersJubilee has structures and plans that will ensure that it wins all seats in the Rift Valley region and even other parts of the country.We are fully behind Jubilee, President Kenyatta and DP Ruto. Other parties have no place, especially in our region, and will not be able to confuse voters at election time.Residents of the region will adopt the &lsquo;six-piece&rsquo; voting pattern to ensure that the President, all governors, senators, MPs, woman representatives and MCAs are from the Jubilee Party.Those fearing that the JP nominations will be flawed actually have no reason to fear, only to support free and fair nominations in our party.Although other parties have the right to field aspirants in any part of the country, Jubilee will campaign hard to win majority seats in Parliament, senate and the county assemblies.Kanu aspirants will thus not give JP a headache, especially in the Rift Valley.I want to make it clear that I am in Jubilee to stay and those who want to move should not try to cause unnecessary confusion.Jubilee is the party to belong to and the party to beat at the August 8 poll, because, as a party, our record speaks for itself. Since Jubilee took over it has in five years done what all other past governments never did since Independence, including that of Kanu.Governor of Uasin Gishu
