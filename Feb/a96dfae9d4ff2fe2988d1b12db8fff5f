National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale has said he will petition the National Assembly to ensure the more than 2,000 sacked employees of the Mombasa Export Processing Zone are rehired.He, on Sunday, said a motion will be introduced to the Assembly and he will rally Jubilee MPs to pass it. Deputy President William Ruto also said he will hold a crisis meeting with Labour CS Phyllis Kandie to find modules that will force the management of the EPZ reinstate the affected workers. The workers complained to the DP on Sunday in Changamwe. They said they were laid off January 2015, without notice and were not paid their dues. They said the sack was instigated by a majority decision to form a union. In January last year, the workers petitioned the Mombasa assembly to intervene.
