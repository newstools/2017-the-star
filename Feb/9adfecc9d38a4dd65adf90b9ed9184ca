More than 500 Murang&rsquo;a traders have been ejected from the Madaraka Market in Thika by a cartel that illegally managed the stalls.They were told to leave for allegedly refusing to register as voters in Kamenu ward.Yesterday, they were flushed out of Mwanalisa on the Kandara-Sagana Junction road reserve. They had pitched camp at the junction.They were chased away by riot police from Gatanga subcounty in the morning.The hawkers had camped at the site with their produce.Gatanga subcounty administrator George Gitau said officers from Kenha spotted the traders and alerted the police that the road reserve near Kari centre had been encroached. Riot police in five Land Cruisers and a lorry were dispatched to the scene and dispersed the traders. Property of unknown value was destroyed during the confrontation. The cartel at Madaraka Market had warned the hawkers against entering the market until they register to vote at Kamenu in Makongeni, Thika West subcounty.Gitau said a local politician was behind the &ldquo;unfortunate&rdquo; and &ldquo;undemocratic&rdquo; move. The administrator said the traders had gone to the site after they were victimised at Madaraka.
