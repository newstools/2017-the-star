A widow of the son of former minister Stanley Oloitiptip has appealed against a ruling in which she lost a Sh500 million land in the city. The land on Ngong Road is associated with former Marakwet West MP David Sudi, through a company called Chaka Limited.Grace Sorora says High Court judge Pauline Nyamweya erred in ruling in favour of Chaka. Sorora, through lawyer Nelson Havi, said she acquired the land with her husband Francis in 1981. Havi told the Court of Appeal that while Sorora owned the land, Pan Africa Credit, through the Deposit Protection Fund Board, sold the property to Toi Educational Services on June 6, 2008. He said Toi in turn sold the property to Chaka in a transfer done on July 16, 2009. Havi said in a letter dated August 26, 1985 the City Council of Nairobi acknowledged that Francis owned the property, but Chaka&rsquo;s lawyer Ham Lagat says the letters were forged. The judgement will be delivered on May 5.
