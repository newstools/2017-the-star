Former Ulinzi Stars striker Ezekiel Otuoma is poised for a great season with his new employers Western Stima. Otuoma completed his move from the Soldiers&rsquo; side last month.He has set his bar high and is optimistic of getting back to his free-scoring days. &ldquo;I look forward to helping the team go for the title this season. I have set a personal target of 15 goals for the entire season,&rdquo; he added.Otuoma was out for the entire first leg of the 2016 season due to a knee injury. He struggled with match fitness upon coming back in the second leg and couldn&rsquo;t make the starting eleven regularly. However, he is hopeful he will be injury-free for the entire season.&ldquo;When I returned from injury, I found out that someone had already taken my position and I struggled a lot with match fitness. I had limited playing time at Ulinzi last season so I decided to set my eyes elsewhere. I hope I will be off injuries this season. That way, I will be at a better position to achieve my goals,&rdquo; Otuoma said.&ldquo;We have trained together and played some friendly matches at Stima and there is a lot of improvement. Most of the players are new but we are doing our best to gel,&rdquo; Otuoma revealed.He said he has received great support from both the players and the coaches at Stima and believes that the generous reception will go a long way in helping the team throughout the season. Western Stima finished sixth last season and will be looking to better their position this season. This has been boosted by their January acquisitions including Otuoma from Ulinzi Stars, Jackson Saleh from Gor Mahia, and Muhoroni&rsquo;s Moses Arita among others.If the fixture for the 2017 season released on Monday is something to go by, Stima will start their campaign by hosting Muhoroni Youth FC, the team Otuoma played for before joining Ulinzi in 2014, at Kisumu Stadium this coming Sunday.
