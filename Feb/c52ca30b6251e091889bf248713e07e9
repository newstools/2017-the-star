After morale-crushing defeat at home last weekend and deduction of four points, Kanbis will be seeking to shrug off the painful experience as the 2017 Nairobi Provincial Cricket Association (NPCA) Twenty 20 league enters second round.Kanbis lost to Stray Lions and Swamibapa before being deducted four points for walking off the pitch against the latter. The move saw Kanbis drop two places down to settle in third position with Stray Lions and Swamibapa occupying the top two places respectively.Kanbis face Ruaraka this afternoon before taking on Kongonis tomorrow morning as they seek to prove a point to their fans after last weekend&rsquo;s disappointment. Ruaraka are yet to win a match in the last seven encounters while Kongonis have only won twice.Kanbis, if their current batting line up is anything to go by, have what it takes to open a new chapter in their campaign as they seek to reclaim the title from Swamibapa. Swamis will be away to Sikh Union tomorrow as they seek to avenge on their first round loss against the hosts. The last time two teams clashed, Sikh Union won by seven wickets in a low-scoring game. Since their last meeting on the opening day of this year&rsquo;s campaign, the two sides have posted contrasting results.While Swamibapa have won five matches, Sikh Union have only won three. Their one wicket loss to Cutchi Leva last weekend jeopardized their ability to challenge for the title, especially in the absence of their Ugandan players.Ugandans Arthur Kyobe, Francis Nsubuga and Hamu Kayando, who have been key to the side&rsquo;s last three wins, were not available for last weekend&rsquo;s matches and their return will boost Sikh Union chances this time round.Despite winning five of their seven matches, Swamis have not been in the same form that saw them dethrone Kanbis with their batting still wanting. After Sikh Union match, Swamibapa will head back home at Nairobi Jaffery to welcome Nairobi Gymkhana.
