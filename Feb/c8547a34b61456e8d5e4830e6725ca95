Baracuda Airways chief executive John Majiwa will be charged in court today with conning clients more than Sh200 million.Majiwa was arrested by Flying Squad officers on Saturday in the CBD as he was headed to the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport.The officers said Majiwa has been on the run since Wednesday when the matter was reported. They said they tracked his movements and trailed him for two days.It is suspected Majiwa, who runs the airways, has conned more than 40 investors.Police say the man was using the names of Deputy President Willam Ruto and Mama Ngina to con victims.One victim told the Star he was introduced to Baracuda by his uncle.&ldquo;In September last year I was called for co-pilot interviews and was the only one out of six people who passed the interview,&rdquo; she said.She added that Majiwa asked her to pay Sh2.7 million to attend special training in South Africa.&ldquo;He told us DP Ruto and Mama Ngina had shares in the company. Being that my uncle introduced me to the company I had no doubt it was a legitimate organisation,&rdquo; she said.She said Majiwa was among those who conducted interviews at Weston Hotel.&ldquo;We paid the money on grounds that on completion of the South Africa training we could ask for claims after investors put in their money,&rdquo; she said.In October, while in SA, Majiwa told them Prince Rahim of Saudi Arabia had visited Kenya and promised to invest in the airline and so he requested them to deposit money in his account to activate it. Majiwa told them since the company had not officially opened an account, his account needed to be activated with a good amount to ease bank transactions.&ldquo;It is from here that we started sensing something was wrong,&rdquo; she said.A man and four women suspected to be Majiwa&rsquo;s accomplices was also arrested.The six were taken to Kilimani Flying Squad headquarters where they were interrogated.
