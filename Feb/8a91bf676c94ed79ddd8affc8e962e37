The CEOs of two strategic parastatals are still in office and there is no communication of who will succeed them, despite the expiry of their contracts.The term of the CEO for the Commission for Legal Education, Wanyama Kulundu-Bitonye, expired on February 6.According to the Kenya Gazette, Kulundu-Bitonye was appointed on February 6, 2013, to serve a four-year term.His successor is yet to be named and the CEO is said to be going on with his duties.At the Rural Electrification Authority, the board chaired by Simon Gicheru is said to be wrangling over a proposal to extend the term of CEO Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a Munyu.Munyu has been CEO since July 2013. He turns 60 this year.Last year, the Industrial Court ruled out extension of terms for CEOs who have reached 60 years &ndash; the retirement age for public servants in Kenya.Our phone calls and text messages to Gicheru went unanswered.A board member who spoke on condition of anonymity said, &ldquo;The law is clear on the retirement age, which is 60. The court last year pronounced itself that no CEO should have his term extended upon the attainment of the retirement age.&rdquo;
