Professionals from Gatundu North constituency on Saturday engaged MP aspirants in a Thika hotel.Only three out of seven aspirants attended the forum.They are Henry Njenga Mbote, Vincent Gichuru Gaitho and Patrick Mungai.The aspirants were asked questions on their vision on education, environment, economy revival, health and youth and women empowerment.Those who missed the forum were former MPs Patrick Muiruri and Clement Waibara, former radio broadcaster and nominated MCA Wanjiku Kibe, Kiambu county Chief of Staff Dominic Gicheru and MP Kigo Njenga.Mbote who is contesting the seat for the second time said if elected, he will come up with developing development, marketing and education boards and capacity building for women and the youth to empower them economically.Led by James Gichuru Gaitho, the hopeful MP&rsquo;s noted that poor national-county government&rsquo;s relationship was to blame for undeveloped markets and unequipped hospitals in the area.His manifesto also includes value addition for farm produce, talent promotion among the youth and improving security to boost investment. Gaitho said he will encourage diversification from traditional farming and reliance of crops like coffee and tea. The hopeful who is making a third stab at the seat noted that poor national-county government&rsquo;s relationship was to blame for undeveloped markets and unequipped hospitals in the area. Mungai called for mature campaigning challenging locals to desist bribes to sell their votes. &lsquo;Poor leadership in Gatundu North will prevail not unless we get rid of handouts; it&rsquo;s a challenge to electorates to castigate bribery and elect visionary leaders who are ready to serve the common,&rsquo; he said.On the first course of action if elected, Mbote said he will move a bill in parliament to compel the government to make all farm inputs duty free.He said if elected, he will within 60 days engage the County government of Nairobi and the Nairobi Water and Sewerage Company to give jobs to youth from Gatundu North where the main water treatment plant is located.Mungai said he will move a bill in parliament for the return of the Kenya school equipment scheme and the start of a revolving fund for people with disabilities.Gatundu North Professionals chairman Clement Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a said the forum was called after the realization that professionals have a role of ensuring that there exists transformational leadership.
