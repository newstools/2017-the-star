Warning of a rigged election, NASA opposition chiefs yesterday issued a raft of tough demands they want IEBC Wafula Chebukati and his new team to satisfy.They met the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission yesterday for the first time since the team was sworn in on January 20.IEBC promised to respond within a week.Atop the list, NASA demands a single, consolidated voter's register, and not the use of several logs as in the past.They want the secretariat staff vetted for "compromised elements", especially in ICT and registration departments.The opposition demands investigation of the involvement of chiefs and other civil servants in tracking down residents and registering them.The commission must accept final results declared at the constituency level, NASA said.It says the ICT committee is stacked with Jubilee partisans and demands fair representation.Details of Diaspora voters must be disclosed and they must only be registered with valid passports, the opposition said.ODM chief Raila Odinga said Jubilee was using personal and confidential information of Kenyans and using it to manipulate the voter register."Kenyans will not allow a flawed election again," Raila told a press conference after meeting he IEBC at Capitol Hill.The opposition, operating as the National Super Alliance, met the IEBC on Capitol Hill and sought assurance an independent ICT certification body will be involved.They demanded that the ICT body certify the electronic register of voters and that the process of appointing the firm and auditing the register shall be above board, inclusive and acceptable to all parties concerned.Yesterday was the first time Chebukati and his commissioners met NASA since they assumed office on January 20. They met President Uhuru Kenyatta on Tuesday.Opposition chiefs also included ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi, Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka and Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang'ula.Chebukati and panel assured them that all their concerns will be address and the commission was determined to deliver a free and fair election."We came here for a discussion with opposition, and we have listened to them. We will be going through their grievances before we get back," Chebukati told reporters afterward.IEBC asked the opposition leaders to cooperate in ensuring the election was credible and all Kenyans can freely express their will."We want to compete fairly," Raila saidBoth the opposition and Jubilee administration have asked IEBC to ensure the voter's roll is clean.The opposition also asked the commission to vet the secretariat staff and weed out "compromised elements", especially in ICT and voter registration departments."The new team should account for the BVR kits," said the NASA memorandum presented to the commission.NASA also asked the commission to publish a list of all Huduma centres that are registering voters and guarantee the integrity of the voter's register."We believe the commissioners can resolve these issues and other emerging ones so we can all go into elections on an equal playing field," said Ford Kenya Wetang'ula.NASA complained about the ICT committee created by the amended Election Acts, saying it is dominated by Jubilee and operates in an opaque manner."The coalition demands to be given a minimum of two slots so that they can appoint ICT experts to represent their interests," NASA said.The commission, NASA leaders said, must accept final results declared at the constituency level."Persons involved in the electoral process should be able to conduct their own tallies based on constituencies declared results and give projections of a winner. The controlled and centralised national tallying centre will in this case only apply to declaring official results," they said.On diaspora voters, the coalition demanded disclosure of the potential number of voters to be registered, the validity of their passports and reaffirmation of their commitment to only register using valid passports."We call upon the commission to publicly publish the list of passport holders residing in the target countries," NASA said.The coalition recommended a recommendation to register voters using any document other than passports.The ODM chief said the IEBC must investigate the involvement of civil servants in tracking down residents and registering them."We have even seen retired [General Julius] Karangi getting up to campaign for a failed regime. That is how desperate they are," Raila said.on Tuesday President Kenyatta promised the government will continue providing all necessary support to the IEBC.All budget requirements of the IEBC will be prioritised so the commission can organise free and fair elections, he said.President Kenyatta made the statement when IEBC Commissioners paid him a courtesy call at State House, Nairobi, as part of their outreach to all stakeholders.by the Chief Executive Officer Ezra Chiloba.The meeting was attended by President Kenyatta&rsquo;s adviser on Constitutional Affairs Abdikadir Mohamed.
