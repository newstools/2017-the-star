Pan-African housing financier Shelter Afrique has been given the go-ahead to implement a raft of measures to bolster its operations and push its agenda of promoting affordable housing.Among them is the bridge financing from the African Development Bank, allowing the transfer of $8.2 million (Sh851.2 million) and a subsequent line of $20 million (Sh2.1 billion) to shore up Shelter Afrique in the short term.During an extraordinary general meetingin Nairobi yesterday, members adopted the Deloitte forensic report and its recommendations, which exposed malpractices in the running of the company. The report linked top managers to massive looting of funds through creative accounting and subprime lending at the company. The board had last week said it will punish those involved. &ldquo;What we are faced with today is not only a liquidity crisis but an opportunity to reshape and reinvent the way we deliver affordable housing,&rdquo; Chairman Babatunde Fashola said.&ldquo;I am confident that our deliberations and resolutions today will send a strong signal to the markets that we do not take housing lightly and we do not take Shelter Afrique lightly either.&rdquo;
