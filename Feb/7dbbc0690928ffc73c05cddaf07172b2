Reigning world steeplechase champion Hyvin Kiyeng&rsquo;s is keen to defend her title at the World athletics Championships in London in August.The 24-year-old athlete, who lost to Kenyan-born Bahraini runner Ruth Jebet at the Rio Olympic Games, has started her preparations to defend her title.On Saturday, she finished second in the women&rsquo;s senior 8km race during the Central Rift cross country championships in Nandi County, behind the two-time world cross country junior champion Violah Kibiwott.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have any intention of competing at the World Cross Country Championships but I am using it as a build-up ahead of the London 2017. It is good for endurance and speed,&rdquo; said Kiyeng at Mosoriot Teachers Training College.The athlete, who trains under the Kaptagat-based Global Sports Communication camp together with Berlin Marathon champion Eliud Kipchoge under the tutelage of former Olympic 3000m SC silver medallist Patrick Sang, has no pressure at all from her rival Jebet. She said her focus is on the London World Championships and hopes to deliver at the right time.&ldquo;As long as my training is good, I don&rsquo;t feel any pressure. What is needed most is the peace of mind for me top be ready for the big show,&rdquo; she added.The rivalry between Kiyeng and Jebet is expected again this year when the IAAF Diamond League season kicks off in Doha, Qatar in May.&ldquo;I will use the series for build up too and I will start it in Doha. I don&rsquo;t fear anyone and besides such meets are important in gauging one&rsquo;s performance,&rdquo; she said.Kiyeng settled for silver in a personal best of 9:07.12, behind world record holder Jebet in Rio.
