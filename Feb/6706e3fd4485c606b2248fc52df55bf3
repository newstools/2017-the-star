Chief Justice David Maraga wants MPs to amend the law to speed up the resolution of disputes arising from political parties&rsquo; nominations.The CJ has already forwarded to Parliament draft amendments to ensure disputes arising out of political party primaries are resolved within the settimelines. Under the proposals, Maraga said limiting the number of appeals will help achieve the one-year period within which all election petitions should be determined.&ldquo;If we allow that [unlimited appeals] to continue, then lots of those cases will not be resolved until 2022,&rdquo; he said.In the proposals sent to National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi, Maraga wants election petitions of MCAs to only end up in the High Court in case of an appeal.Those of MPs, senators and governors should only end up in the Court of Appeal in case of appeals.He also wants the Election Act amended to allow only one appeal in election petitions. In the proposals, the Judicial Service Commission will appoint temporary members to the Political Parties Dispute Tribunal to deal with disputes arising from political party primaries.It wants amendments to the Political Parties Act to create additional membership to ensure all complaints are expedited before the parties forwardthe names of their candidates to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries commission.&ldquo;In some areas, there is going to be fierce competition for seats. In some places holding nominations is like conducting general elections and we are anticipating an avalanche of nomination petitions. That is why we want temporary members who will sit all over the country to deal with these issues,&rdquo; the CJ said.Political parties will hold their nominations between April 13 and April 26 and are supposed to submit the names of their candidates to the IEBC by June 24.The Political Parties Dispute Tribunal has 18 days to deal with nomination complaints.He said the short period of time given for settlement of disputes may not be adequate to deal with the high number of anticipated suits.The disputes panel currently has five members.The CJ is due to appoint two more members to make it fully constituted as required by law.Muturi said he has directed the National Assembly Justice and Legal Aff airs Committee to expedite the processing of the draft bills before they are introduced in the House.&ldquo;In many places nominations will be a matter of life and death and I am appealing to the committee to look at these proposals because they havecome from people who have experience in dispute resolution,&rdquo; he said. The two spoke in Mombasa during the parliamentary leadership retreat, which will set the House agenda forthe final session. Endebess MP Robert Pukose lauded the proposals, saying justice delayed is justice denied.But Matungu MP David Were asked how Maraga will deal with the cases pending in the Supreme Court, following the 2013 election.The CJ said the Judiciary plans to determine all cases older than five years by the end of 2018.
