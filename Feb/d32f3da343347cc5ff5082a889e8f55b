The Office of the DPP and the Attorney General want to be enjoined in a case where regional coordinator Nelson Marwa has been sued for saying Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho&rsquo;s friend Aharub Khatri is a suspected drug baron.Assistant DPP Alexander Muteti asked to be enjoined following the nature of pleadings filed by Khatri in his suit.Muteti said the DPP has a role to play because police are investigating Khatri over drug trafficking allegations.He told the court Khatri had no reason to sue Marwa because he is a public officer and was only disseminating information to the public.&ldquo;Marwa must not have acted in a personal capacity as alleged by the plaintiff, but he was speaking as a public officer and as the chairman of the county security team,&rdquo; Muteti said.He said Marwa is in charge of security coordination.AG Githu Muigai stated that Marwa has immunity from civil suits.&ldquo;Let the plaintiff deal with the government and keep Marwa out of this. The court should not allow him to carry the baggage that comes along with his work,&rdquo; he said. Muteti said, &ldquo;Issues of acting in a personal capacity are neither here nor there.&rdquo;
