Somalia is expected to elect a new President on February 8 as the country strives to overcome its history of decades-old conflict.About 24 candidates have been cleared to run for the top post and their fate will be decided by 329 members of the Lower and Upper Houses who will elect the new President.But the question dominating political discussions among many Somali nationals is whether the legislators will heed the public&rsquo;s heightened calls for reforms to elect a new reformist technocrat to steer the country&rsquo;s destiny for the next four years.This comes amid deep public frustrations over persistent failure by current and past career politicians to fix security, tackle runaway corruption, restore vital services and enhance good governance.A host of former top leaders are seeking another chance in office including incumbent President Mohamud, former President Sheikh Sharriff Ahmed, and former Prime Ministers Omar Abdirashid Sharmarke, Mohammed Abdullahi Farmaajo and Ali Mohammed Gedi among others. But time has come to bet on a technocratic and reformist leadership in Somalia. Currently, there is a serious leadership crisis in Somalia that is unable to tackle the country&rsquo;s most pressing challenges including the recurrent devastating drought that has left at least 3.5 million Somali nationals in desperate hunger.The aspirants who have served as Presidents and former Prime Ministers in the recent past have failed to deliver on what Somali nationals really need. Their past record in office is a clear vote of no-confidence against them.All the different elements needed to rebuild Somalia are there. The only element lacking is a visionary and technocratic leadership.For instance, the management of public resources under successive Somali governments has been dismal, with precious government resources getting lost through high-level corruption and bureaucratic wastage.That&rsquo;s why even the security forces and civil servants often go for months without pay despite the government getting considerable revenues.Much of the funds received from the international community are not reflected in the official budget. There are no effective accountability systems to ensure prudent use of public resources.A corruption perception index released last week by international NGO Transparency International ranked Somalia to have the worst corruption record among the 176 nations surveyed.Many Somali nationals are now counting on the new crop of legislators who will vote to elect the next president to focus on merit of individual candidates rather than being influenced by financial inducements or clannism as it happened in the past.Fortunately, many legislators are well educated and progressive, including youths and women. It is hoped that they will heed the strong public pressure for reforms and accountability when they cast the ballot on Sunday.In the history of recent presidential elections in Somalia, no sitting President has ever been returned to office. I am confident that the trend will continue and pave way for a new reformist leadership in Somalia.Somalia and the region badly need peace and stability and that&rsquo;s significant investments are needed to build a unified national army that is well-paid, equipped and trained to restore law and order. The current security forces are not only poorly funded and trained but are also built along clan lines, making them less effective.Somalia cannot continuously depend on the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) to secure the country, since the troops from neighbouring nations will not be in Somalia indefinitely.A new leadership also needs to tackle high levels of youth unemployment, which is causing many of them to undertake risky journeys to immigrate to affluent parts of the globe while many others are drawn into groups like Al Shabaab and pirates.This can be cured by attracting investments into the country and enhancing technical training of the youth to equip them with the right set of skills.Other priority issues are reconciliation of Somalis and restoring basic social services such as education and health among others. That&rsquo;s a why Somalia needs a reformist and technocratic leadership more than ever before.Dr Warsame is a finance specialist with international public and private sector experience in Auditing.
