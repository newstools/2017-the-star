Drug money has massively corrupted Kenya and suspected drug dealers get away for years on end through the expedience of endless injunctions, appeals and referrals in the courts.The proceeds of drug dealing corrupt the economy and the justice system and the products promote addiction.The extradition to the US of the brothers Baktash and Ibrahim Akasha is therefore most welcome (see report P30). They are the sons of slain drug baron Ibrahim Abdalla Akasha, who was assassinated in Amsterdam in 2000.Sixteen years down the line, his sons will face charges of drug trafficking in a competent jurisdiction.This is the culmination of a sting operation by US anti-narcotics agents who posed as Colombian drug dealers and caught the Akashas red-handed. Drug dealers have acquired such power in Kenya that they make local law enforcement and the Judiciary impotent and themselves immune to prosecution.It is time to begin cleaning out drug money from the economy, which will make the economy and Kenyans healthier.
