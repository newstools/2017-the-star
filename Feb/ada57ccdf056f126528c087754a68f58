The Maasai Council of Elders has urged the community to reelect the Jubilee government. Council chairman John Maitai (pictured) said the community stands a better chance of benefitting from Jubilee than the opposition. Speaking to the press in Narok town yesterday, he said previous regimes marginalised the Maasai for almost five decades but Jubilee changed this.
