The EACC is investigating allegations Sh10 million county funds were used to post bail for 23 Trans Nzoia MCAs charged with illegally receiving allowances for a funeral.The Sh47,000 was paid to each MCA in 2014 to travel to Nairobi to receive the body of former Matumbei ward representative Ronaldo Matongolo. They didn&rsquo;t travel, the body had already been moved to Kitale.Two top county officials allegedly authorised the withdrawal on Monday after principal magistrate Harrison Barasa ordered the MCAs to pay Sh150,000 bail each or Sh200,000 bond.The MCAs said they could not deposit their title deeds with the court because the Lands registry has been closed for digitisation.The MCAs requested lenient bail terms, but state counsel Zachary Omwenga opposed this.Barasa maintained the bail terms, but the MCAs could not raise the cash.Governor Patrick Khaemba and chief finance officer Ben Wanjala were unavailable for comment.Sources at the county said the MCAs had refusedto pass the county budget and top officials took advantage of the court case to help the MCAs to pressure them to approve the budget.Speaker chargedOn Wednesday, speaker David Kinisu Sifuna and another 17 MCAs were charged before an Eldoret court with abuse of office.They are accused of using county cash to pay medical bills and funeral expenses without authorisation.They denied the charges.Sifuna was accused of allocating public funds to pay for the funeral costs of an MCA.The more than Sh3 million had not been budgeted for.Sifuna was released on Sh150,000 bail.EACC detectives had said two MCAs had fled to avoid arrest.
