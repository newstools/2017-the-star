The High Court has overturned last year&rsquo;s directive by the government to close the Dadaab refugee camp.Justice John Mativo said the directive issued on May 10 by Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery to close the camp and repatriate refugees and asylum seekers back to Somalia was arbitrary, discriminatory and indignifying.&ldquo;The right to a fair administrative action ... has been denied, violated, infringed and hence the decision is null and void,&rdquo; he said.Mativo directed the state to reinstate and operationalise the Department of Refugee Affairs.He said that blanket condemnation and labeling of Somali refugees as terrorists is discriminatory and violated the principle of &ldquo;individual criminality&rdquo;.The Kenya National Commission on Human Rights and Kituo Cha Sheria, supported by Amnesty International, had sued the government challenging its decision to close down the Kakuma and Dadaab refugee camps.The ruling was praised by several human rights groups.Amnesty Regional Director for East Africa, the Horn and the Great Lakes Muthoni Wanyeki called it historic.&ldquo;Today is a historic day for more than a quarter of a million refugees who were at risk of being forcefully returned to Somalia, where they would have been at serious risk of human rights abuses,&rdquo; she said.Wanyeki said the ruling reaffirms Kenya&rsquo;s constitutional and international legal obligation to protect people who seek safety from harm and persecution.Speaking separately, Garissa peace committee secretary Hassan osman welcomed the judgment saying it was timely and that the judge "reaffirmed Kenyas commitment to the international convention agreement in which kenya is signatory".&ldquo;It is only when real stability and governance is attained in Somalia, with complete social amenities for the refugees and their children, that they should be taken back," he said.Majority of the refugees who have voluntarily gone back home have been resettled in central and southern parts of Somalia in Doble,Badaab,Jilib and Kismayu.Norwegian Refugee Council country director Neil Turner welcomed the ruling saying repatriation of refugees should be voluntary.&ldquo;Today, there is an urgent need for Dadaab to remain open, as the current drought and food crisis is devastating parts of Somalia and the prospects for a safe return of Somali refugees from Kenya is drastically diminished,&rdquo; said Turner.Medical provider M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res termed the ruling is good news. The camp was initially due to be closed on November 30 last year, but the government announced a six-month delay on &lsquo;humanitarian grounds&rsquo;.Dadaab&rsquo;s closure would effectively have left more than 260,000 Somali refugees with nowhere else to go. The government through the interior ministry has been blaming the camps for hosting terror suspects.Most of those who spoke to Amnesty International in a report published in November 2016 accused Kenyan government officials of coercing them to return to Somalia against their will.In May last year, Kenya told the international community to support its move to close the Dadaab refugee camp and channel finances in resettling the refugees back to Somalia.Deputy President William Ruto told the World Humanitarian Summit attended by UN Secretary General Ban ki-Moon and other world leaders that the camp had become a burden to Kenya. The DP said the country&rsquo;s contribution and commitment to humanitarianism is beyond question.
