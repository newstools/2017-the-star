The Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry Vihiga chief executive Geoffrey Vukaya has welcomed the move by the Kenya Copyright Board for artistes in the music industry to pay fees for one licence. Early this month, KNCCI Vihiga had raised concern that entrepreneurs in the entertainment industry were being forced to apply for many permits by various organisations under KECOBO.The KNCCI said the proposal to have a single permit, spearheaded by the Performer&rsquo;s Rights Society of Kenya CEO Angela Ndambuki, will end the confusion in the industry. Vukaya said: &ldquo;The move will bring out the aspect of inclusiveness as stipulated in the Constitution through public participation of all stakeholders across the country.&rdquo; He said lack of clear taxation rules by the Collective Management Organisations (agencies that represent performers&rsquo; interests) has been hurting businesses. The CEO said Vihiga is ready to host the three CMOs to give artistes a chance to air their views.
