The government is compiling a list of blacklisted contractors, Infrastructure PS John Mosonik has said. He said the list of the contractors who do shoddy jobs and take too long to complete projects will be made public. &ldquo;Any contractor not performing will be blacklisted and will never get any job in the country. We shall write to the National Construction Authority to delist the contractors,&rdquo; Mosonik said. He spoke in Kisii town on Tuesday after inspecting the Mogonga-Kenyenya and Metembe-Marani roads.
