Wines and spirits distributors in Meru have urged the provincial administration and the county government to assign them police and enforcement officers to arrest transporters of second-generation liquor.Meru Wines and Spirits Sellers Association chairman Solomon Murithi said re-emergence of the trade has hurt their businesses in Nkubu, Chogoria, Laare and Maua.Addressing journalists in Meru town yesterday, the distributors accused the administration of letting the &ldquo;killer drink&rdquo; business thrive under their watch.Officials tabled samples of the illicit liquor on sale in Meru and Tharaka Nithi counties. It was packed in plastic containers, some missing Kenya Bureau of Standards marks of quality.&ldquo;This liquor has taken a toll on our business. When we report, the provincial administration and police let the brews into the market after they are bribed,&rdquo; Murithi said.&ldquo;As genuine traders who lost millions [of shillings] in the initial crackdown, we are not ready to let them continue tarnishing our business. We want action taken.&rdquo;He said association members have complied with the County Alcohol Control Board regulations, but they face stiff competition from sellers of illicit liquor. The officials said only 21 liquor manufacturing companies have government accreditation.Before the massive crackdown on illicit brews ordered by President Uhuru Kenyatta two years ago, 365 companies were operating.Treasurer Sam Gathuru said they are losing 40 per cent of the market share to second-generation liquor.&ldquo;We invested heavily in the business, but we moved on after the closure. It is bitter to see people sell what the government barred us from selling,&rdquo; he said.Gathuru owns Imenti Springs Wines and Spirits Distribution.
