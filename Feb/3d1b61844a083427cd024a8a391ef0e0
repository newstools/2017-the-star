They are all our sons and daughters from whom we shall seek assistance in future irrespective of the election results," he said.Okude urged the youth not to be used as agents of violence and instead make wise choices.He warned politicians against using the youth to cause mayhem, adding that they will still need them in future.Okude thanked the IEBC for accepting extension of mass voter registration by five days.
