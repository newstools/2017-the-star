The first Athletics Kenya relay series event earlier scheduled for this weekend has been pushed to February 25 at Nairobi West Prisons ground.. AK vice president in charge of competitions, Paul Mutwii, said they have postponed the event to pave way for some regional cross-country meetings this weekend.&ldquo;Regions like Nairobi, Central and Coast are going to have their cross-country events this weekend to select their teams for nationals and we don&rsquo;t want the event to clash with the relays,&rdquo; added Mutwii.He asked athletes to continue training for the start of the relays series; noting that that early preparations were key if Kenya was to make a mark at the World relay Championships slated for Bahamas in April. &ldquo;We must start our preparations and get the best athletes to compete and represent the country,&rdquo; he added. Mutwii noted that the various regions and counties should have wrapped up their cross country events by January 28 but due to unavoidable circumstances, they were forced to push them forward. &ldquo;We had wanted to finish regional cross country meeting by last month but the counties kept pushing them forward,&rdquo; added Mutwii.Elsewhere, world 1,500m champion Genzebe Dibaba added to her growing list of record-breaking achievements by breaking the world 2000m record at the Miting Internacional de Catalunya in the Spanish city of Sabadell on Tuesday.The three-time world indoor champion overtook the pacemaker just before the half-way mark, which was reached in 2:42.65, and continued to extend her lead over her younger sister Anna and Morocco&rsquo;s Siham Hilali.She went on to stop the clock at 5:23.75, taking almost seven seconds off the world indoor best set by Gabriela Szabo in 1998. Although the 2000m isn&rsquo;t an official world record event indoors, Dibaba&rsquo;s performance &mdash; pending ratification&mdash;can be classed as an outright world record as it is faster than Sonia O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s outdoor mark of 5:25.36.As well as the outdoor 1,500m world record, Dibaba now owns the fastest ever recorded times indoors for the 1500m, mile, 2000m, 3000m, two miles and 5000m.Elsewhere in Sabadell, European champion Adam Kszczot won the 800m in 1:46.31 with Spanish record-holder Kevin Lopez taking second place in 1:46.58.
