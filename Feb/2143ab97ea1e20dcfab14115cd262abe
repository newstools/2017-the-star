The United States has asked politicians to keep off violence ahead of the August election and instead engage in issue-based campaigns.US Ambassador Robert Godec said they have no preferred candidates or political parties since the election is about Kenyans themselves.He asked Kenyans to participate and democratically elect their leaders.&ldquo;Let the campaigns be aimed at addressing issues facing citizens and avoid inciting Kenyans,&rdquo; Godec said.He spoke after touring mangrove projects at Gazi in Msambweni, Kwale, on Sunday. Godec said the election has to be peaceful, free, fair and credible.Those who will not be satisfied by the election results or the process should seek constitutional agencies, like the court, to address their issues.&ldquo;If after the election is held people have objections and don&rsquo;t believe there was fairness, let them go to institutional agencies,&rdquo; Godec said.He criticised corruption, which he said is a big problem that needs to be addressed by Kenyans to put an end to it.Godec also visited Mikoko Pamoja project and the Gazi Women&rsquo;s Board Walk. The ambassador praised Mikoko Pamoja project initiators in Kwale, saying it creates jobs, protects the environment and improves fish population in the mangrove.Godec said the introduction of direct flights to the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport to USA is a good move.Kenya received a safety certification last week from the US Federal Aviation Administration that will allow its airlines to apply for non-stop flights to US airports.Non-stop flights would cut hours off the lengthy journey between the two nations, and provide a major boost to Kenya&rsquo;s tourism industry.Kenya Marine and Forest Research Institute Research scientist Amina Juma said the institution has assessed the amount of carbon that can be produced from Mikoko, which is owned by communities in Kwale.&ldquo;We were involved in the development but management is done by the community,&rdquo; she said.Salim Mwamrima, Mikoko Pamoja coordinator, said they aim to ensure the Gazi Women&rsquo;s Board Walk gets tourists campsites that will see visitors spend nights.
