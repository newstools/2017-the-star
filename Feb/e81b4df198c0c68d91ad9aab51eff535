Tourism CS Najib Balala has asked the Kenya Airways to ensure the direct flights for Kenya-US are realised before the end of the year.Balala said the National carrier should fast track the process after the US government granted JKIA Category One status on Thursday."This is a major milestone in the growth and development of civil aviation in Kenya, East Africa and the rest of Africa," read a statement from the Kenya Airports Authority.Balala was speaking at the US Embassy where he received a delegation of visitors from Association of Travel Agencies in Washington DC."There are no excuses for KQ, this thing must be implemented this year, we have to maximise on this opportunity as it will open up good markets for us," Balala said.Though it is not clear on how much the government has estimated for expansion of airports in 2017/18, Balala said the government will now embark on expansion of some terminals at JKIA to carter for the new route.He said Mombasa airport will also be expanded to give room for more tourists coming to the region.Balala said," The announcement is a major milestone for us. The government must now start thinking of building a brand new airport, that is what will now make the difference".Kenya Airways said it was pleased with the Federal Aviation Administration&rsquo;s (FAA) decision to clear Kenya to operate direct flights to and from the United States of America.&ldquo;Our first priority now is to pursue codeshare arrangements with our partners in the Skyteam Alliance.This will enable us to sell tickets to and from any US State and drive revenues directly to us&rdquo;, said Kenya Airways&rsquo; Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Mbuvi Ngunze in a statement. &ldquo;This process will take time but we will start immediately.&rdquo;In parallel Kenya Airways plans to undertake a commercial evaluation and discussions with the relevant authorities to determine the viability and timing of operations. We will update on this as and when we are ready.Balala said talks were also underway to build cruise liners along the Coast and Indian Ocean.US Ambassador Bob Robert Godec said his government was committed to ensuring that more Americans toured the country.He said over two million US citizens have applied for Visas to come and tour Kenya.Godec however, said his government will continue to issue travel advisories to its citizens."Travel advisories will always be issued in regard to areas that should not be visited. This does not intend to depict Kenya as a dangerous place," he said.With this category, there will be faster movement of goods and people between the two countries, eradicating delays especially on horticultural produce from Kenya.The issue of directs flights between the two countries has been on and off for close to five years.Read: Kenya implementing final requirement for direct US flights -KCAAKenya scored 88 per cent in a security audit by the ICAO conducted between September 17 and 24, 2015, above the minimum 80 per cent required mark.This was after failing in previous audits where ICAO gave JKIA 78.42 per cent February last year, up from 66 per cent in 2013.Kenya had granted a licence to Delta Airlines of the US for direct flights from Atlanta in 2009, but the airline was refused permission by the US government, citing security concerns.
