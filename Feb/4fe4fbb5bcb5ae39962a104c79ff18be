Tough campaign regulations bar candidates in Nairobi from addressing anyone in their mother tongue, for fear of communal incitement.Such gag rules on local languages at political rallies are the first in recent memory, though they were imposed in the emergency from 1952-59.Chief administration officer John Ntoiti outlined the mother tongue ban and other regulations in a media briefing at City Hall yesterday.They cover use of banners and billboards, all requiring prior City Hall approval.Ntoiti said all ward and subcounty administrators and inspectorate officers have been instructed to arrest any politician who speaks in a vernacular language on a campaign podium.&ldquo;What are you hiding that you must speak in that language if not inciting people? We shall arrest and charge you with causing public disturbance,&rdquo; Ntoiti said.&ldquo;Aspirants, if you have been picked from a village to Nairobi to run for a political seat, know that this is a cosmopolitan area. Stick to national languages.&rdquo;Violators could be jailed or fined as much as Sh300,000.As for billboards and posters, the city must approve each and every one.&ldquo;On top of the court fine, we will pull down or even burn the billboard, or whatever it is and the structure that holds it. The licence of the owner of that particular structure will also be withdrawn,&rdquo; Ntoiti said.He said politicians will not be allowed to post or erect their campaign materials &ldquo;without order&rdquo;.&ldquo;The city has its rules which must be followed. We cannot allow politicians to plaster posters in every building or put their banners in front of shops or block road signs,&rdquo; Ntoiti said.The administrator also ordered all voter registration banners and billboards be pulled down immediately.The licences for the materials expired with the end of voter listing last Sunday. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not campaign period,&rdquo; he said.The Kenya National Highways Authority has posted warnings on major roads, cautioning politicians against posting their campaign materials.Violators risk a fine of Sh85,000.The IEBC has not announced the official campaign period, but posters and billboards bearing politicians&rsquo; pictures are already posted in the capital.President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto&rsquo;s Tuko Pamoja Jubilee billboards are the most common.
