The Energy Regulatory Commission has called on investors in the country's fuel market to comply with set regulations while doing their business.ERC senior manager- power systems Buge Wasioya, said that the country was loosing millions of shillings through malpractices by individuals.Speaking at a one day sensitisation workshop targeting stakeholders in Garissa,Wasioya said the commission has put a number of measures which include random checks on petrol stations to curb selling of adulterated product. &ldquo;A lot of the government revenue is from sell of petroleum products. So if somebody is pretending to sale diesel yet there is some bit of kerosene in it, then the government is being denied that revenue the person gets,&rdquo; he said. He said the commission has also launched a self-test kit for petroleum retailers who can now test products upon delivery from oil marketers, before accepting it. &ldquo;As a regulator, we will be at the forefront in communicating to the general population the need for orderly conduct by all, including compliance with relevant regulations, those who fail to do so will be met with heavy penalties,&rdquo;he said. On oil prices, Wasioya said petroleum products in the country are cheaper compared to other East Africa communities. He said ERC, which reviews prices on a monthly basis, is working at making the rates much lower. Garissa county deputy director of energy Dekhow Khalif said the training will go along way in building capacity across sector. Khalif said the county government will take over issues of licensing, inspection and safety regulations. ERC is established under Section 4 of the Energy Act, 2006 to carry out the technical and economic regulation of downstream petroleum, electricity and renewable energy.
