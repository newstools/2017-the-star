The Alego Usonga ODM branch has been hit by a leadership row between two groups led by chairman Orwenjo Umidha and treasurer Peter Owino. The two have differed over the running of the branch. Owino has accused Umidha of micromanaging the branch. The Owino-led faction comprises former Siaya County Council chairman Aggrey Onyango and organising secretary Adhiambo Faja. Citing conflict of interest, it has asked Umidha to resign and said he is inept.Owino on Wednesday claimed Umidha has failed to offer progressive leadership, especially in urging residents to register as voters. &ldquo;As at Wednesday, Alego Usonga had only registered 11,618 voters, out of 26,053 target,&rdquo; he said. Owino said this is an &ldquo;insult&rdquo; to ODM leader Raila Odinga, who traces his roots to the region.But Umidha said since the mass voter registration drive started he has convened four meetings with delegates. Siaya ODM elections coordinator Dalmas Oyuga said, &ldquo;The chairman has negated the spirit of transparency, fairness and accountability in the party operations.&rdquo; They spoke at Villa Hotel, Siaya town.
