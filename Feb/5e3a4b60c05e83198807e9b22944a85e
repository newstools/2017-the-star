Chege-in General Contractors was in charge of the building funded by the national government.It collapsed on Friday night due to what is believed to be poor workmanship. Workers had finished working on the slab during the day and were expected to continue with construction.Losiakou MP David Pkosing and Senator John Lonyangapuo had differed on the location of the college. The project was to be completed in a year when it started, but it has been delayed for more than two years.men dug foundationReports said the contractor did not use equipment such as graders to prepare the foundation, and instead employed people to do it.Resident John Tulel said the contractor mobilised men to excavate the rocky site for the foundation, instead of using a grader.&ldquo;From the beginning of the project, we sensed there was a problem. How can you engage men with hoes to prepare the ground for a storeyed building? There was poor workmanship and this is why NCA was petitioned to stop the project,&rdquo; he said.Hundreds of residents walked from as far as Chepareria, 10km away, to view the collapsed building.They demanded the arrest of the contractor for shoddy work. &ldquo;We had raised concerns about the stability of the building and we were happy when the NCA stopped construction. We want the contractor, who went on with the work, to be held responsible because this is our money going to waste,&rdquo; said Tulel.
