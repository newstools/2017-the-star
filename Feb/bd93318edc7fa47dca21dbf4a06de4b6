A contractor has done shoddy work in building an ECDE classroom at Sibuka Primary School in Budalang'i, which has developed cracks and is likely to collapse before its completion, a parent has said.Speaking to the Star at the project site on Monday, John Bwire said Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong should visit the schooland see the shoddy work done. He should also account for the shoddy work whose payment has been authorised by the Housing department, Bwire said.He also said the county government launched the construction of the ECDE classrooms three years ago, the contractor abandoned the project.&ldquo;The county government of Busia should move with speed and trace the contractor and force him to redo the project or else the same be awarded to another contractor to ensure the safety of our children,&rdquo; Bwire added.
