Nominated MP Bishop Mutemi has ditched former Vice-President Kalonzo Musyoka for Mombasa Governor Alfred Mutua in continued realignment in Ukambani.Mutemi was nominated to Parliament by Kalonzo's Wiper after the 2013 elections but moved to Mutua's Maendeleo Chap Chap on Monday.While receiving him, Mutua said that Mutemi will not vie for the Mwingi West Parliamentary seat on a Maendeleo Chap Chap ticket.Mutua has been marketing his party as an alternative to the existing political parties ahead of the August elections.Last he received defectors from Jubilee including Embu Senator Lenny Kivuti and President Uhuru Kenyatta's education adviser Kilemi Mwiria.Mutua has however expressed support for Uhuru's re-election despite Kalonzo's Wiper, which was the key party in Ukamabani being in the opposition.
