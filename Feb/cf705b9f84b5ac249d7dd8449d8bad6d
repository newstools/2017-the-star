A postmortem yesterday revealed that a policeman attached to National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi&rsquo;s home in Nairobi was shot dead with a pistol.A fellow AP officer arrested over the killing had been issued with an AK-47 rifle on the night of the attack. The weapon has since been taken for ballistics examination.Gigiri DCI chief Philip Kandie yesterday told the Star that the latest findings complicated investigations, but police had picked up a new line of questioning. The suspect has denied shooting his colleague and claimed there were attackers from outside the speaker&rsquo;s residence along Thigiri Gardens road in New Muthaiga.He said he was asleep in the guardroom when he heard gunshots and later discovered that his colleague had been shot thrice by gunmen at around 1.30am on the night of February 11.Nairobi police chief Japheth Koome said only the two guards were at the speaker&rsquo;s residence when the incident happened. Muturi and his family had travelled to Mombasa. Detectives failed to secure any CCTV recording that would have helped unravel the murder mystery.When police visited the scene for the first time, the guardroom was in disarray, indicating a possible physical struggle. GSU officers manning a neighbouring residence told detectives they rushed to the scene after they heard gunshots, which were fired from Muturi&rsquo;s compound, but they did not see anyone at the gate.
