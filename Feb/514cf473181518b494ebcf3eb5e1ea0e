The Kisii county assembly on Thursday passed a bill that ensures a retired governor gets a Sh10 million gratuity and one four-wheel-drive vehicle. The Kisii County Retirements Benefits (Governor and Designated Officers) law will also benefit retired deputy governors, MCAs and former councillors. The four-wheel-drive vehicle will be of the retired governor&rsquo;s choice, but its engine capacity will not exceed 4000cc. It will be replaced every four years and will be maintained using taxpayers&rsquo; money. The bill was tabled by Chitago Borabu MCA Albert Oino. Once assented to, the new law will accord a retired governor, deputy governor, speaker, their spouses and children under the age of 21 full medical cover with a reputable insurance firm. This will cover local and overseas treatment. A deputy governor and speaker will get Sh8 million and MCA Sh5 million.
