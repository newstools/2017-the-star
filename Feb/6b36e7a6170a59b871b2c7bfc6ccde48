Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho was yesterday told to stop panicking over the government&rsquo;s crackdown on drug dealers. National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale said Joho should let state agencies tasked with fighting drug trafficking do their work, instead of scolding President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto and terming the move political. &ldquo;Uhuru and Ruto do not arrest drug dealers. Why is he panicking? Everybody will be dealt with by state agencies and people should not panic. Joho should relax because state agencies will come for him,&rdquo; Duale said in Parliament. Uhuru and Ruto talked tough over the drug business during their mass voter listing campaign in Mombasa, where they promised that the Jubilee administration will root out all barons and their networks. Ruto said, &ldquo;The end has come and there is no more space, room and time for them to engage in drug [trafficking].&rdquo;
