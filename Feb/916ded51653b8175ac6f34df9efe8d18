Education CS Fred Matiang&rsquo;i has maintained reforms in the education sector will continue and he will not relent in his resolve to restore order in the sector. Speaking at Chania Boys&rsquo; High School, Thika, on Friday, he said he is under strict instruction by President Uhuru Kenyatta to implement reforms. He issued Sh32 million bursaries to more than 6,000 students. &ldquo;No one will be spared in the purge to get rid of the rot in the education sector and restore it to its past glory. There is no looking back,&rdquo; Matiang&rsquo;i said. He accused critics of never seeing anything good from the government. The CS said the digital learning programme is right on course. He said in this financial year, Sh50 billion has been allocated to improvement of learning infrastructure in schools across the country, adding, &ldquo;If this kind of investment is put to good use, it&rsquo;ll help our children. We have to adequately prepare our youth to move this country to the next level. I&rsquo;ll not be party to any scheme geared towards ruining the lives of our children.&rdquo;
