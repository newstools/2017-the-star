Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero elicited laughter when he said county askaris will guard cemeteries to ensure "no ghost escapes to go and vote" in the August 8 polls.He said NASA will carry the day because the opposition has sealed loopholes opponents may use to steal the election."We have two cemeteries in Nairobi, one for Muslims at Kariokor in Gikomba and the other at Langata. We are going to finish fencing off Langata and Gikomba and we will put very strong gates," he said on Sunday."From August 5 to 10, all the gates will be locked. No ghost will be allowed to leave to go to vote. So those who think they will bring ghost who think they will escape will be arrested and beaten thoroughly,&rdquo; he added.Kidero was addressing a service at Voice of Salvation church in Buru Buru.The Governor noted that bad leadership is to blame for low voter registration turnout, especially among youths, countrywide.Read: Blame State inefficiency for low voter turnoutAlso read: Cracks appear in Mt Kenya, 2017 voter apathy in Central could hurt Uhuru in next electionKidero said the youth are a disappointed lot and no longer see any meaning in participating in the general elections."Less than 50 per cent of the expected number is registering and people who are not registering are especially the youth between the age of 18 and 26,"&nbsp; he said.&ldquo;We have been asking ourselves why and the answer that is coming is that the youth are disappointed with the leaders,&rdquo; Kidero said.Kidero said the youth "cannot reconcile themselves with the abusive language that we see [among leaders] on TV and here on our radios".He added that voter apathy will perpetuate the problem of bad leadership.&ldquo;If you have an irresponsible government that is borrowing without consideration, that debt will be paid in future by the current youth. So the youth must register and vote to stop such acts,&rdquo; he said.Figures released by the IEBC last week showed that only 1.5 million people have register against a target of three million in the last two weeks.The electoral commission aims to register six million new voters by the end of the exercise on February 14.Read: Homa Bay risks voter apathy as ID application forms run out
