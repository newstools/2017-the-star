A French police sniper has accidentally shot and injured two people during a speech by President Francois Hollande in western France. The shot was fired as the officer moved position on a roof about 100m (328ft) from a tent where Hollande was speaking in the town of Villognon. The bullet went through the canvas of the tent, where drinks were being made. It passed through a waiter's thigh and lodged in another person's calf. The injuries were not life-threatening. Hollande was inaugurating a new stretch of railway when a loud noise like a gunshot was heard. He interrupted his speech for a few moments, but reports said there was no panic. "I hope it's nothing serious. I think not," Hollande said as he paused his address to ask whether anyone had been hurt. The president later visited the injured - the head waiter of a local hotel and an employee of a railway maintenance company.One local report said the safety catch of the sniper's weapon was unlocked, allowing the gun to be discharged accidentally.The marksman is based with a special protection unit in nearby Poitiers, officials said.A judicial investigation has been launched.
