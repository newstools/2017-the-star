The entry of Siaya Senator James Orengo &mdash; one of the ODM heavyweights &shy; &mdash; in the Siaya governor race is causing jitters among three aspirants and incumbent Cornel Rasanga.He is expected to declare his bid on Tuesday next week.Businessman William Oduol, former PS Carey Orege and Rarieda MP Nicholas Gumbo have declared interest in the seat.Orengo is one of the most influential, experienced and high-profile figures in ODM and the opposition.He is a serious threat.Some aspirants and residents are questioning why Orengo entered the race late. Rasanga&rsquo;s supporters argue Orengo e is not genuine, but wants to destabilisee county politics.They say he is beyond county politics and he should retain his position as senator to focus on national matters. Gumbo said Orengo joined the race late because ODM cannot build consensus as it did in 2013, when he joined the Senate race late.Gumbo, who spoke at his home last month, urged Orengo to forget the governor&rsquo;s job because there will be no &ldquo;consensus and freebies for politicians, regardless of their seniority&rdquo;.&ldquo;We pleaded with Orengo in 2013 to go for Siaya governor, but he declined, saying he was not ready to operate from the village. What has changed, other than the year?&rdquo; Gumbo said. &lsquo;Enjoys freebies&rsquo;He accused Orengo of being &ldquo;fond of enjoying freebies&rdquo;. Gumbo said those who declared interest earlier have spent a lot of resources in grassroots campaigns and will not be party to any consensus. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think Siaya people are ready to be hoodwinked, while they are the ones to choose a suitable candidate for governor,&rdquo; he said.Gumbo urged ODM to avoid chaos by not short changing aspirants. &ldquo;The consensus or agreement that was reached in 2013 on distribution of posts should not be considered this year,&rdquo; he said. Speaking separately, Nominated MP Oburu Oginga said Rasanga should have another five-year term.&ldquo;Oduol is young and I advise him to consider vying for MP or MCA, as he masters the game of politics. In future, he can vie for governor,&rdquo; he said.Rasanga said Alego-Usonga elders should advise Oduol &ldquo;before he breaks his ribs&rdquo;.&ldquo;We do not want our own son to break his ribs as he did in 2013. Let the elders advise him appropriately.&rdquo;
