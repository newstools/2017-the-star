Churches have said they will fight a law requiring religious organisations to file audited accounts.The Kenya National Congress of Pentecostal Churches and Ministries says members were caught unawares when they were ordered to attach audited accounts to annual returns they filed with the Registrar of the Societies. Vice chairman Rev Stephen Ndichu yesterday said the deputy Registrar of Societies has since Tuesday refused to receive the returns, demanding financial details from the churches. Ndichu, a former MP, urged Attorney General Githu Muigai to &ldquo;rein in his junior staff&rdquo; against being used to malign the government by instigating a confrontation with the churches. &ldquo;It seems somebody somewhere still harbours some grudge with the church in Kenya with the aim of putting a wedge between the government and the faith-based organisations,&rdquo; he said.The Office of the Registrar of Societies last week started implementing the new regulations for religious organisations and their leaders. The regulations require the religious organisations and movements to reveal their source of funding. They are also required to show annual financial returns with audited accounts, declaration of assets and liabilities of the religious society, tax exemption or clearance certificate of the religious society and bank statements of all accounts operated.
