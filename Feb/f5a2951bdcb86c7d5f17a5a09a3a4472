The Kenya National Union of Teachers Mandera branch has said it will defend and protect non-local teachers.Secretary general Mohamed Kulo on Saturday said non-local teachers face many problems, mainly from local communities, and vowed to tirelessly defend them. &ldquo;So many issues affect teachers.School principals harass them over petty issues. As Knut, we&rsquo;re ready to fight for our members,&rdquo; Kulo said.He said insecurity has remained a major threat and appealed for support of the local communities to protect the teachers so they can improve the region&rsquo;s education standards. Kulo urged head teachers to accord special treatment to stop intimidation. This contributed to mass exodus of non-local teachers in 2015, he said.&ldquo;These teachers face transportation challenges to reach Mandera, yet head teachers interdict those who report late without considering this. This must stop,&rdquo; Kulo said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going round urging locals to accept these teachers and provide accommodation so our children can learn. We&rsquo;re yet to receive a satisfactory response.&rdquo;
