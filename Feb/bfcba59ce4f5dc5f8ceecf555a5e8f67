Kiambu police on Monday evening nabbed four suspects who were in possession of 400 bags of coffee worth Sh16 million.They acted on a tip-off from the public. The officers trailed the suspects to a building in Murera, Juja subcounty and arrested them as they offloaded the bags. &ldquo;We sent undercover officers who followed the links and were able to arrest the four,&rdquo; county commander Adiel Nyange said, adding that the suspects did not have any documentation to show they had bought the coffee as they claimed.Nyange said the coffee was of grade 1 and 2, which is usually costly. He said it was either stolen from a warehouse, a factory or was in transit, adding that they have launched investigations.&ldquo;We will also summon the owner of the building to assist us in our investigations. Again, we will dig deep into the matter and bring to book other suspects who are at large believed to be members of the coffee theft syndicate,&rdquo; Nyange said. Coffee theft has been rampant in factories, especially in Murang&rsquo;a and Nyeri.
