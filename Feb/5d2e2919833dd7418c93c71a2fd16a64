If I do not win the ODM ticket, please reelect Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga, hopeful William Oduol has urged residents.He said although his relationship with Rasanga (pictured) has not been rosy, &ldquo;We should not allow the governor&rsquo;s seat to cross the bridge as it will be an uphill task getting it back.&rdquo;He spoke on Saturday. &ldquo;If you deem me not fit for the seat, give it to Rasanga. But if he is not your choice give it to me.&rdquo; Both Oduol and Rasanga come from Alego Usonga. Oduol said residents will lose out if they fail to elect someone from the area. &ldquo;Power is only sweet when it is in your backyard,&rdquo; he told residents at Segere centre a few metres from Rasanga&rsquo;s home.
