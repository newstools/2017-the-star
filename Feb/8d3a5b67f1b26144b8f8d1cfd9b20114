The Kenya Sports Shooting Federation has instituted a women&rsquo;s .22 rifle prone league that will roll out in March. Over the weekend, small-bore recorded an all-time high number of female trigger pullers with 17 competing for the Colortunes Cup title in different classes. Women have been contesting against their male counterparts due to their poor numbers and separate league was impossible.Gurupreet Dhanjal, the national .22 rifle prone captain said there has been an increase in the number of new shooters, including women signing up to compete in the sport and especially small-bore hence the formation of another league category.&ldquo;This is also to encourage women to aim for great performances locally so that we can field strong teams of in continental and international shows,&rdquo; added Dhanjal, who also intimated that Africa Sports Shooting Federation is organizing a women&rsquo;s Championships to run concurrently with the annual continental trigger pulling extravaganza both set for May in Cairo, Egypt.&ldquo;KSSF have had a talk around having women compete amongst themselves for years but women&rsquo;s numbers could not allow the implementation of the league. Since we now have enough numbers, we will now have a separate women&rsquo;s league. They are competitive and it will be fitting to have them compete on their own meets,&rdquo; said Dhanjal.
