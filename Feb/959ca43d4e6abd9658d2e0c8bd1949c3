Jubilee has made Kenya a favourable investment destination, which has stimulated the economy and generated more jobs, Kiambu Senator Kimani Wamatangi has said."The government&rsquo;s efforts to make Kenya a global investment destination of choice has borne fruits as the country is receiving more and more investors through trade and is the most preferred investment recipient in Africa," he said.Wamatangi on Saturday at JKIA when he received Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Saeed Hussein Khalil el-Sisi on behalf of President Uhuru Kenyatta.The Egyptian President came to Kenya for a one-day state visit to strengthen economic ties with Kenya.Wamatangi said, "Kenya strengthening trade ties with the world also creates a cordial relationship and an affirmation of the Jubilee government&rsquo;s commitment to widen the network of trade and development partners around the globe.""The Kiambu county government should seize the opportunity being presented by the bilateral talks between Kenya and Egypt and lure investors to the county."Wamatangi added that Kiambu offers a better investment destination as it has been rated the best county to transact business by the World Bank.Kiambu offers better opportunities as it has the best soils for farming, a good business environment, including real estate, and has tourists attractions. It also boarders the capital city and this should lure investors to invest in the county, the senator said.He said the Jubilee administration has hosted many international conferences last year to match local small business enterprises with potential investors for sustainable development. This has improved the economy, Wamatangi added."We have a lot of untapped natural resources in the counties and through partnership with the developed countries we can harness the resource, which will in turn earn the county governments revenue," he said.
