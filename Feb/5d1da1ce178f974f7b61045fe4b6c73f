More than 400 families displaced by armed Pokot bandits in Mochongoi, Baringo South, have appealed for food and materials to rebuild their houses.&ldquo;Owing to fears of more attacks they opted to move to safer ground, but now they are facing more challenges of how to feed their families, graze their livestock and take their children to school,&rdquo; Mochongoi chief Patrick Kamerey said.On Sunday, the bandits from the neighbouring Tiaty shot and injured a woman at Chebinyiny village and torched 17 houses.&ldquo;They initially pretended to ask for land to graze their animals before turning around to attack and displace the residents,&rdquo; Kamerey said.He linked the attacks to disputes over pasture and water, amid the prolonged drought.Kamerey said although nobody died during the attack, Tugen residents from Kabel and Tuiyotich villages were displaced and are now homeless and have no food.He said other affected villages are Arabal, Chebinyiny, Kabel, Kamuryan, Kapkechir, Lomoiwet, Nyimbei, Tuiyotich and Sampaka.The administrator said two schools were closed following the attacks.&ldquo;We are urging the government to pitch police posts and deploy more security officers to avert further attacks,&rdquo; Kamerey said. Resident Elizabeth Kabon told the Star on Friday that she is housing 10 displaced families but does not have enough food for all of them. She asked the government to give them food.
