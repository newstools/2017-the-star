IEBC said on Tuesday it may appeal against a judge's ruling that cancelled its contract with a Dubai-based firm to print the ballots for August's local, parliamentary and presidential elections. Monday's ruling came after the latest in a series of opposition challenges over the running of the votes, in a country with a history of disputed elections. But IEBC spokesperson Andrew Limo said it should not delay this year's contest.The electoral agency had awarded the Sh2.5 billion tender to Dubai-based firm Al Ghurair last year. But a high court judge cancelled it, saying it did not follow new election regulations, after it was challenged by the opposition. "It is certainly a setback but we don't think it is going to hugely affect the election date," Limo said.More on this: Chiloba admits High Court ruling major set backRead: Court cancels ballot papers tender, orders fresh process"There is still room to do another procurement if it comes to that, but right now our lawyers and top officials are studying the ruling with a view to appeal." President Uhuru Kenyatta is running for a second and final five-year term. He is widely expected to face veteran opposition leader Raila Odinga, whom he defeated at the last elections in 2013.The preparations for the August polls are being keenly scrutinised by the opposition, which disputed the outcome of the previous two elections. The previous electoral board resigned in October after the opposition accused them of corruption.
