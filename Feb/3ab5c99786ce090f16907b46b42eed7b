Wiper is yet to settle on a candidate for Machakos governor as it has become evident incumbent Alfred Mutua will not seek reelection on the party&rsquo;s ticket. Sources said top officials are searching for a strong candidate and are determined to unseat Mutua at all costs.However, the search is proving to be no walk in the park as top brass have different preferred candidates.Senator Johnson Muthama is said to back Deputy Governor Bernard Kiala, a choice that has not gone down well with party leader Kalonzo Musyoka.Close confidants of Kalonzo said he does not believe Kiala has what it takes to unseat Mutua.Kalonzo has reportedly tried to woo Kathaini MP Robert Mbui and the East African Legislative Assembly member Peter Mathuki for the position.He is also said to be trying to reach out to Machakos &lsquo;Iron Lady&rsquo; and CCU leader Wavinya Ndeti in an agreement that may see the two parties merge.Some residents have said a Wiper and CCU collaboration would be a sure bet to unseat Mutua.&ldquo;If the two parties can agree the headache of who and how to beat Mutua will be a thing of the past,&rdquo; resident Charles Mwangangi said.However, Ndeti&rsquo;s terms may not be agreeable to Wiper.Sources say she had expressed interest in merging, on condition that she get the get the governor post under CCU and Wiper get the deputy position.Her suggestion, has, however, been treated with a lot of suspicion, the sources say. Mbui has declined Kalonzo&rsquo;s offer and will defend his Kathiani seat. Observers said Mbui would have been easy to sell because of his networks. His late grandfather Rtd General Jackson Mulinge was respected.
