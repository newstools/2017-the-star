Residents have asked why, despite severe rationing, is Nairobi Water imposing huge charges on them?&ldquo;Since January, I have not received water for more than three times in a week. And now I'm forced to pay Sh1,000 more if I don't pay the bills on time,&rdquo; Gladys Mbogoria from Buru Buru said.At a press conference two weeks ago, NCWSC managing director Philip Gichuki said the fee was provided for in the new tariffs and is a penalty for those who fail to clear their bills on time.The new tariffs were announced last year. Low-income consumers are charged a flat rate of Sh200 if they use six cubic metres or less. The middle class is charged between Sh45-64 if they use between seven and 60 cubic metres.Residents who do not pay their bills by first of every month are fined Sh1,000. But MCAs and residents say this is unfair.&ldquo;I want to know why this is happening. Nairobians are suffering yet more charges are being imposed on them. This is exploitation,&rdquo; Kahawa West MCA Ngaruiya Chege said last week. He was speaking in the assembly chambers on Tuesday.But Gichuki said, &ldquo;It is an issue of those who default in paying their bills.&rdquo;Governor Evans Kidero said, &ldquo;I think the issue here is that people should pay their bills in time to avoid paying a penalty.&rdquo; Water has been rationed since last month because of the drought. Levels at the Ndakaini Dam have dropped from 89 million cubic metres to 37.5 million cubic metres.The level dropped seven per cent in January alone.The drop has been caused by drought in Kikuyu, the Aberdares and Mt Kenya, the main water catchment areas for rivers serving the Ndakaini Dam.The county, in partnership with the National government, is sinking 40 boreholes.
