Three Cabinet Secretaries have urged Wajir residents to ditch ODM and support the ruling party at the August 8 election.The JP administration officials, who on Saturday visited Wajir West and South subcounties, urged residents to follow in the footsteps of their Mandera counterparts, whom they said voted overwhelmingly for President Uhuru Kenyatta at the March 4, 2013 election.Out of six Wajir MPs, only one was elected on the Jubilee ticket, something JP feels it has to overcome this time round.&ldquo;President Uhuru Kenyatta has worked well with your Governor, Ahmed Abdullahi, and other leaders from this region without looking at party affiliation,&rdquo; Water CS Eugene Wamalwa said. &ldquo;The President has performed well, unlike the opposition, which is interested in divisive talk and empty promises.&rdquo;He said tarmacking of the Garissa-Mandera B9 road is on course and the Sh8 billion Bute Mega Dam and Sh500 million water-for-school project in Wajir and other regions have been commissioned.Devolution CS Mwangi Kiunjuri and his Agriculture counterpart Willy Bett shared similar sentiments. Kiunjuri criticised Cord leader Raila Odinga for disparaging Uhuru and Deputy President William Ruto, despite their accomplishments.He said the Jubilee administration&rsquo;s success is evidenced by development projects it has implemented since coming into office in 2013. Kiunjuri praised Governor Abdullahi&rsquo;s efforts to develop the county and urged him to join JP.Abdullahi has drilled 147 boreholes in the county and was feted for this and made water ambassador. The county has spent more than Sh1 billion on water. He has also managed to track water consumption in more than 156 settlements to determine the level of need, especially during dry seasons.The leaders were on a drought assessment tour. They distributed 1,000 bags of rice, 220 bags of beans and 60 cartons of cooking oil to Hadado and Biyamadhow residents. The county government distributed 285 tonnes of food to 227 early childhood centres.
