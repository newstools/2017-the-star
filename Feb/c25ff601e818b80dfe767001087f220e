The web- https://webstore.kebs.org gives Kenyans an opportunity to obtain Kenya standards, adopted international standards and also the harmonised East African standards, unlike in the past where they had to physically buy them from the bureau&rsquo;s offices. Kenyans can access Kenya Standards via the desktop computers, laptops, tablet computers and mobile devices.KEBS managing director Charles Ongwae said:&ldquo;Our aim is to give Kenya standards to Kenyans at their convenience. We are now providing an engaging and informative experience for our customers. The new web store provides increased flexibility for future growth for our institution.&rdquo;The standards body expects an increase in website visitors, which will ultimately leads to an increase of standards consumption and increased understanding on the solution it provides for their businesses. &ldquo;At just a click of a button, one can purchase the standard using a credit card or via mobile money that is Mpesa or airtel.Customers do not need to come physically to Kebsoffices anymore to purchase the standards,&rdquo; Ongwae said.In addition to paying using mobile money or visa credit card, the online channel also allows consumers to search for standards by document number or keyword, an option to subscribe to full, partial or selected category of standards collection and an option to download purchased standards.The Kebs web store was developed through funding from Trade Mark East Africa .
