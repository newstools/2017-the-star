One third of Kenyans have full confidence in the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission, a new poll by Ipsos suggests.Another 34 per cent of the respondents said they have &ldquo;some confidence&rdquo; in the IEBC while only one-in-five (19 per cent) have &ldquo;no confidence at all&rdquo; in the electoral agency.The third publication of the survey conducted between January 9 and 26 shows that overall, about one-third of Kenyans (31 per cent) have &ldquo;a lot confidence&rdquo; in the IEBC.However, the country&rsquo;s level of political polarisation over this issue is seen again with five times more Jubilee supporters (53 per cent) having the highest level of confidence in the IEBC than opposition supporters (nine per cent).Conversely, six times more of the opposition supporters (36 per cent) have no confidence in it as do the Jubilee supporters (six per cent). This is the first Ipsos survey in which the figure for &ldquo;a lot of confidence&rdquo; (31 per cent) exceeds that of &ldquo;no confidence at all&rdquo; (19 per cent) since shortly after the 2013 election.Asked whether they think voters have (or will have) sufficient confidence in the IEBC to &ldquo;manage the next elections&rdquo;, Kenyans are quite divided. Half (50 per cent) of the respondents stated they do, and the remainder divided between those who say they do not (31 per cent) or only do &ldquo;somewhat&rdquo; (13 per cent).Nearly three times as many Jubilee supporters (72 per cent) as those of the opposition (26 per cent) believe voters have or will have sufficient confidence in the IEBC to manage the next elections.About four times as many of the opposition supporters (53 per cent) as compared to the Jubilee supporters (14 per cent believe the exact opposite will be the case. Such contrasts are also reflected across the regions, with the highest perceived level of public confidence in Central (75 per cent), and the lowest in Nyanza (25 per cent). Looking at the results to this question over the last two years, despite some fluctuations, the gap between supporters of Jubilee and the opposition have hardly changed at all.The current gap of 46 per cent being only slightly less than what it was at is largest (53 per cent in August, 2015). The poll shows the 32 per cent of the respondents who registered to vote in 2013 did not do so owing to the fact that they were far from the polling station.
