As we head towards the end of the ongoing voter registration process, there is one crucial point which both leaders and ordinary Kenyans need to bear in mind.This is that &ndash; contrary to what we keep hearing on the hustings &ndash; the end of voter registration will not reveal who will be the winners in the election due in August this year.The statements which have been tossed about to this effect, have really been more of a campaign gimmick, by politicians desperate to fire up their supporters to register, given the very low level of confidence among potential voters, that the next election will in any way lead to an improvement in living standards.Irrespective of what the final tally of newly registered voters might be, there is still a long campaign period ahead during which anything can happen.The likely final outcome will only be clear in the final three months or so before votes are cast.
