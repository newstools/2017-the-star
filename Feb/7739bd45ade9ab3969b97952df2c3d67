The retail sector in Kenya is rapidly expanding and diversifying, encouraging more investment and new shopping habits, a new survey by Procter &amp; Gamble has revealed.The number of shoppers visiting M-commerce online platform, where transactions are carried out via mobile money, has tripled in the past two years.Traditional shopping still dominates the market, although supermarkets and malls, a distant second, are catching up as the preferred shopping outlets for Kenyans.P&amp;G managing director Vivek Sunder yesterday said the country's retail landscape is among the most advanced in the region with high penetration in many product categories.&ldquo;Kenya was reclassified as a middle-income economy in 2015, and this is clearly being evidenced by the shopping habits and rising consumerism,&rdquo; he said.Malls and proposed shopping complexes occupy more than 470,000 square metres of land including residential areas, and attracts retailers who do not want to shop in the city.P&amp;G&rsquo;s FMCG data shows Kenyans spend the bulk of their income (about 60 per cent) on food and beverages, and 23 per cent goes to personal and household care products.Euromonitor projections show total retail is expected to grow by 84 per cent to $16 billion (Sh1.658 trillion) in 2020 from $9 billion (Sh993.1billion).Supermarkets have become permanent fixtures in the rapidly growing number of malls. The survey shows more than half of urban dwellers shop in supermarkets. They are driven by the belief that supermarkets stock well-known brands, generally perceived to be quality. E-commerce is a growing segment within the retail sector, however, many Kenyans are still reluctant to shop at online stores despite the convenience and easy access to great deals, the report sys. "Today, less than one per cent of Kenyan retail sales go through e-commerce and this is likely to hold in the foreseeable future," Vivek said. "Operational and logistical challenges are the main obstacles for the growth of e-commerce and more shoppers will feel comfortable buying items from an online store once the logistical issues of time, location are fixed."While overall retail in Kenya grew by 13 per cent last year, modern retail (supermarkets) grew by 18 per cent, indicating the increasing importance of supermarkets as a retail channel. Supermarkets contributed 30 per cent of the FMCG retail sales for the 2015-16 financial year, and projections show this sector will keep growing as consumers opt to shop in bulk.
