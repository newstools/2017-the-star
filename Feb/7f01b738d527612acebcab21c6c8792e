It is said that the enemy of my enemy is my friend. It is no surprise then that Kabete MP Ferdinand Waititu and Thika Town MP Alice Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a have become good friends with a common agenda &ndash; to remove Kiambu Governor William Kabogo from power. Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a and Kabogo have been sworn enemies since the days both of them ran for Juja MP.When Waititu declared interest in the Kiambu governor seat after capturing the Kabete seat during a by-election to replace slain MP George Muchai, it was no surprise that one of the first MPs to declare support for him was Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a. Majority of other MPs from the county later joined the fray and declared war on Kabogo. Waititu soon became a brand name and until last week, it looked as if he would give the incumbent a run for his money.During a voter mobilization campaign in Limuru, Waititu and Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a urged residents to register as voters, but not to turn up to vote if the Wangige-Ngecha-Rironi road is not repaired. In Kiambu county and Central region as a whole, the August polls are more about the presidency than elective seats, so urging residents not to vote was viewed meaning that the President should not be reelected. When President Uhuru Kenyatta visited Kiambu last Friday, he hit out at the two MPs and urged residents to ignore them and register as voters. He urged residents to vote for him.
