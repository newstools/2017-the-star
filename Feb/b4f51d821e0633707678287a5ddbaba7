Former Inspector General of Police David Kimaiyo has condemned the killing of Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi&rsquo;s uncle, three days after a man was killed in Marakwet.Samuel Lochuria was shot dead by suspected Pokot assailants on Wednesday evening at his Sewes village home, Marakwet East near the Elgeyo Marakwet-West Pokot border.Area police boss Anthony Muriuki said Lochuria, 71, was killed after an unknown number of Pokot attackers opened fire on his home.Muriuki said the attackers fled without stealing livestock during the 5pm incident.Kimaiyo said on Thursday the frequent banditry attacks in Kerio Valley and Marakwet highlands have taken a political dimension following Lochuria's killing.He said the killing happened before 25-year-old Misto Stephen, who was shot dead by Pokot attackers on Monday, is laid to rest.&ldquo;We are planning to burry a youth killed on Monday. But even before we complete burial arrangements, bandits have killed Sudi&rsquo;s elderly uncle,&rdquo; Kimaiyo said.Kimaiyo, who is eyeing Elgeyo Marakwet Senate seat, said he lost several animals when bandits raided his home three times in December, adding the attackers may be targeting local leaders for political reasons.
