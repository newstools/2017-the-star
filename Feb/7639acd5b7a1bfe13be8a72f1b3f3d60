First put your house in order before you seek our support, Mbooni MP Kisoi Munyao yesterday told Wiper.He said the party&rsquo;s wrangles are worrying and an indication it has no future. &ldquo;I cannot risk going back when even chairman David Musila is complaining about unfairness,&rdquo; Munyao said. He spoke in Kalawa ward, when he visited schools to inspect CDF projects. Munyao accused Wiper party leader Kalonzo Musyoka of imposing candidates on the people. He criticised Kalonzo for intimidating Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana last week and for drumming up support for Kitui Governor Julius Malombe. But Kitui West MP Francis Nyenze asked leaders not to drag Kalonzo&rsquo;s name into their differences.
