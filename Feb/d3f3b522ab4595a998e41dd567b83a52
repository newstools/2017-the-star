Opposition chief Raila Odinga yesterday termed the killing of a Baringo parliamentary aspirant and MCA a political assassination. Loyamorok MCA Kibet Cheretei and Tiaty parliamentary aspirant Pepee Kitambaa were shot dead in Baringo on Saturday.Raila yesterday said the killings were politically motivated because the two were the strongest aspirants. &ldquo;President Uhuru [Kenyatta] has failed in everything, including providing security to all Kenyans, which has seen some people take advantage to settle political scores,&rdquo; said the Cord leader.Speaking at Orange House, Raila said unless all leaders intervened to address insecurity, the crime wave will escalate and soon might get out of hand.&ldquo;Even if they were in power for 100 years, there is nothing they can change apart from making our status worse as a nation. Kenyans must stand up against this government,&rdquo; the Cord leader said.Cheretei and Kitambaa were shot dead at a nightclub in Marigat town, Baringo South.&ldquo;Kenyans are going through a hard time where the President&rsquo;s priorities are misplaced. We want investigations into the killings and the culprits arrested and prosecuted,&rdquo; Raila said.He dismissed Uhuru and Deputy President William Ruto following their remarks that the opposition is only interested in power. &ldquo;If Ruto and Uhuru are not interested in power they should go home since they are playing with the lives of Kenyans. We want power back to citizens so that we can serve them better,&rdquo; Raila said. He said Jubilee has resorted to threats and intimidation to hide their failures&ldquo;When we protested against these mega projects used to steal from Kenyans they were everywhere making noise,&rdquo; Raila said.
