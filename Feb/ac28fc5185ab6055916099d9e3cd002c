Degodia elders in Wajir have asked opposition chief Raila Odinga to discipline errant ODM MPs from the county.They want MPs Mohamed Elmi of Tarbaj and Adan Keynan of Eldas disciplined by the National Governing Council for undermining the party, and Wajir Governor Ahmed Abdullahi.Speaking at a rally in Wajir town on Sunday, the elders led by businessman Mohamed Mursal accused the two MPs of doublespeak.The duo support the immediate former Ambasador to Saudi Arabia Mohamed Abdi, who they opposed in 2013 in favour of Governor Abdullahi. &ldquo;We want Raila to discipline these two rogue MPs. We elected them on the ODM ticket and they should be putting Jubilee in check, not undermining the county government and its leadership,&rdquo; Mursal said.The elders also accused the two MPs of forming a splinter group of the Degodia clan. The elders endorsed governor Abdullahi as the governor candidate at the Wajir ICT center last month. &ldquo;We will not allow Elmi and Keynan to endorse any aspirant for any position. They have their own battles to fight in their constituencies,&rdquo; Abdille Dakane, an elder, said.
