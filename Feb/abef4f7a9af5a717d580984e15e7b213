Nyando MP Fred Outa stormed Ahero Girls Secondary School and incited students last year, a court heard yesterday.Nyando deputy county commissioner Kennedy Lunalo said Outa entered a classroom after security officers had calmed students who had rioted. He banged on a table, demanding to know who the riot police were.&ldquo;At this point the students cheered loudly and no peace was witnessed henceforth,&rdquo; he said.In October, students went on the rampage, demanding the immediate reinstatement of principal Sarah Adipo. She had been interdicted for alleged mismanagement of funds.The school was closed indefinitely after a confrontation between students and riot police. School property was destroyed.Outa faces three charges of inciting form four students, causing malicious damage to property (unlawfully destroying the school&rsquo;s gate) and causing a disturbance in a manner likely to cause a breach of the peace.He denied the charges.Lunalo testified on Tuesday before Kisumu chief magistrate Julius Nga&rsquo;r Nga&rsquo;r. Sergeant Steven Apuoka said they evicted the MP from the classroom because of his unruly behaviour. He said Outa and his bodyguards immediately made calls and within minutes villagers had started throwing stones at the school. The hearing will continue on March 10. Outa was arrested and released on Sh100,000 bail after spending a night in police cells. Adipo was replaced by deputy principal Stellah Wang&rsquo;ala in an acting capacity. She was interdicted after she refused a transfer. She sued to challenge her interdiction and temporarily resumed her position. Adipo was again interdicted after she failed to honour the order.
