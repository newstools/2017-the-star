Listed Limuru Tea yesterday said its net profit for the year ended December 2016 will fall by least a quarter compared to the previous year on increased cost of production and revaluation of its assets. Its net profit was Sh3.04 million in profit in 2015, meaning earnings for 2016 will drop by at least Sh760 million.The company said the amendment to the International Accounting Standards on biological assets valuation, effected in January 2016, largely impacted the decline in earnings.&ldquo;The estimated decrease in results is mainly due to the impact of the amendment of IAS 41 (biological assets valuation), bearer plants to IAS 16 (property, plant and equipment) resulting in the classification of bearer plants as depreciated assets which negatively impacts the earnings,&rdquo; the company said in a statement.
