The decision by Vihiga MCAs to reinstate suspended speaker Dan Chitwa has elicited mixed reactions. Chitwa was suspended for presiding over graft in the assembly and allegedly using Sh1.2 million assembly cash on his honeymoon in the Seychelles. The Umbrella of Civil Society Organisation, through chairman Emmanuel Asava, yesterday welcomed the speaker&rsquo;s return, saying the suspension was a witch-hunt. &ldquo;The suspension was political. Those who suspended him are now back to their senses,&rdquo; Asava said. &ldquo;If the speaker embezzled funds, why was he not surcharged?&rdquo; he said. But another civil society organisation, the Samaritan, through its patron Mark Ihaji, said, &ldquo;This is a sad day for Vihiga residents. Why are the MCAs bringing Chitwa back after he has been out for six months? They found him guilty of abuse of office and suspended him. I don&rsquo;t know what changed that they now see him as a saint.&rdquo;
