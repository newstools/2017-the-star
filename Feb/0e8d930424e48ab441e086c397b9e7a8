Actis, a multi-asset emerging market investor, has partnered with Arc Skills to bridge skills gap in the growing construction industry. Actis said its partnership with the training firm will equip artisans with new skills. The company last Friday feted 130 students in Nairobi for acquiring internationally accredited certification in construction. Speaking during the event, Actis senior partner Torbjorn Caesar said nearly half of the youths trained are employed. He said the joint venture will boost their corporate social investment programme, and more youths will benefit. &ldquo;Responsibility to the wider society has always been central to our business and is fully integrated into our investment processes. We are proud to partner with Arc Skills and we are inspired by the young people who have been through the programme to date,&rdquo; Caesar said. Arc Skills chief executive Peter Kimurwa said the cooperation will improve the construction industry by developing new solutions to the skills gap.
