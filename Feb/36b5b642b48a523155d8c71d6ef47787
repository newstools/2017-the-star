The events and entertainment fraternity came together to raise money for Kevin Ombajo, better known as Big Kev. Kevin, the CEO of Tru Blaq entertainment, just had the 14th tumour surgically removed from his head.The fundraiser was held at the Carnivore grounds, Nairobi. It is one of the many initiatives organised to raise funds for Big Kev&rsquo;s medical bills.The night&rsquo;s event raised Sh7.2 million. At one point, popular stars Nameless and Redsan were auctioned and they raised Sh300,000.&ldquo;It is such a touching night, to see everyone come through,&rdquo; Nameless said.One of the committee members behind the organisation of the fundraiser, Bruce Odhiambo, said he has watched as Big Kev went in and out of hospital for surgery nine times.&ldquo;Six years ago, I had a heart surgery and two year later I had another one, it tears you to shreds. I come from a community were we are proud, you don&rsquo;t seek for help and you say you will die like a man,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;I was hopping for 60 to 80 people for a prayer meeting at Nyayo Stadium, but this... you are all God sent.&rdquo;The organisers had hoped to host 600 people and they had over 500 attendees.
