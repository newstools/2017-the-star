The growing influence of Amani National Congress debunks opinion polls&rsquo; low ranking of party leader Musalia Mudavadi, Kakamega senator hopeful Alex Mukabwa has said.The consistent low ratings of Mudavadi by Ipsos polls are aimed at derailing his chances of becoming the NASA flagbearer, he said yesterday.Speaking on the phone, Mukabwa said ANC is now the majority party in Bungoma and Vihiga counties, and soon Kakamega. It is also the minority party in Kwale county with a deputy speaker, he added.&ldquo;The current Ipsos rating that put support for Raila Odinga (ODM) at 38 per cent, Uhuru Kenyatta (Jubilee) 24 per cent and Mudavadi at 13 per cent in Western is illogical because ANC as a party cannot grow at the expense of its leader. Ipsos seems to suggest that Mudavadi is losing popularity even as the party spreads in the region. The opinion poll suggests that the more ODM loses to ANC, the higher the rating of its party leader Raila," Mukabwa said.Ten ODM ward representatives in Kakamega county and eight in Bungoma, who were elected in 2013 on the URP, Jubilee, New Ford Kenya and ODM tickets, have decamped to ANC.Yesterday, Mukabwa said any attempt to manipulate perceptions through &ldquo;cooked&rdquo; opinion polls to downgrade Mudavadi&rsquo;s stature and impose an unpopular candidate as a NASA candidate will backfire.&ldquo;It is almost an accepted fact that if Mudavadi is not the candidate, Western, the largest opposition voting bloc, may be scattered. There could be massive apathy and also an opportunity for Jubilee to make quick harvests,&rdquo; he said. NASA leaders appointed a high level 12-member National Coordinating Committee to advice on the presidential ticket and other party matters.The committee is set to present the NASA power sharing agreement to the four leaders &mdash; Raila, Mudavadi, Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper) and Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula (Ford Kenya) &mdash; for signing before the instrument is deposited with the Registrar of Political Parties.Mukabwa said that focus is now on the Western region members of the NCC who form the majority by region and ethnicity as they are there for the community and not their parties.&ldquo;If it came to a vote, we are counting on Sakwa Bunyasi (ANC); Bonny Khalwale, Chris Wamalwa and Eseli Simiyu of Ford Kenya, to prosecute the case for Mudavadi,&rdquo; he said.Mukabwa added that they should not take their parochial and petty differences on a matter of this magnitude for the community and we&rsquo;re keenly watching them.He said the influence of Mudavadi and Wetang&rsquo;ula is enough to galvanise victory if Mudavadi is the flagbearer.
