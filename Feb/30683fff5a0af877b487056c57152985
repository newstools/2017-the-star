Communities who depend on the Boni Forest for a living want the national government to recruit 20 youths from five villages to join the Kenya Defence Forces in Operation Linda Boni.The residents from Basuba, Mangai, Kiangwe, Milimani and Mararani said the youths will be a big help in the war on al Shabaab, as they are familiar with the routes the militants use to and from Somalia.They said the joint security operation has taken long to be concluded, because officers are not conversant with the forest.Most residents were forced out of the forest after the Kenyan security forces launched Operation Linda Boni to flush out al Shabaab militants.There have been no attacks in the area in the recent past.Basuba former councillor Yusuf Kitete yesterday said since the Boni operation started, residents have suffered a lot. &ldquo;Kenya Police Reservists require modern firearms to help KDF in the war on al Shabaab, the Boni Forest is known better by residents, who are conversant with the routes used during the drought and rainy seasons,&rdquo; he said.Kitete said residents depend on the forest for their herbal medicine, food, honey and timber. &ldquo;We cannot access the forest freely and we have no food,&rdquo; he said.Earlier they told Governor Issa Timamy to help them register as voters.Last week Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet toured the area to assess the state of operations and met with the officers on the ground.
