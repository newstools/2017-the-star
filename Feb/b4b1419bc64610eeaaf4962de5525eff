&ldquo;Hold your horses and wait for 2022,&rdquo; Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago has told his main rival billionaire businessman Bundotich Kiprop popularly known as Buzeki.Governor Mandago also warned that tribal and clan politics will cause disunity among the Kalenjins, and between them and other tribes in the county.Buzeki&rsquo;s onslaught to unseat Mandago has caused jitters and analysts in the region say he will give the governor a run for his money in the Jubilee nominations.Mandago spoke at Ainabkoi where he commissioned a potato chilling plant. The facility is expected to reduce post-harvest losses.&ldquo;With such a facility, farmers will be able to store their produce and sell at better prices when the supply is low,&rdquo; Mandago said.Ainabkoi subcounty is considered Buzeki&rsquo;s stronghold because it is his home area.&ldquo;Please tell your son to hold his horses until 2022. He is aware that we have done a lot of work in this county,&rdquo; Mandago told residents.Buzeki has intensified his campaigns across the county ahead of the Jubilee primaries, in which he will face Mandago and former Nandi chief health officer Edward Serem.
