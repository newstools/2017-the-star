The national government has been criticised for delaying release of planting fertiliser. Kenya Farmers Association Kisii branch manager said those who cannot afford to buy fertiliser from local vendors have gone ahead to plant without the chemical.Farmers in Bomet, Sotik and Iten have also complained that they have been forced to plant without fertiliser. The delay has been attributed to slow shipment.West Pokot Senator John Lonyangapuo said the government should sign an MoU with the fertiliser companies to ensure the shipment is delivered in time.Every year there are complains of delay. The fertiliser should be delivered before the end of February, he said. Planting begins in early March.&ldquo;The CS [Willy Bett] told me the government will reduce the delays, but this has not happened,&rdquo; he told the Star. Lonyangapuo urged the Agriculture ministry to provide the right fertiliser for different types of soils.
