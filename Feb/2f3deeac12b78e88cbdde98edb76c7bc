Baringo Senator Gideon Moi will be re-elected on August 8 but his Kanu party and Nasa will not penetrate the Rift Valley region, Jackson Mandago has said.The Uasin Gishu Governor said Nasa, Kanu and Chama Cha Mapinduzi have no influence in the region.&ldquo;The only seat Kanu will win is that of Baringo Senator because the electorate will vote for Gideon in respect of former President Daniel Moi," he told journalists in Eldoret on Tuesday.Mandago&rsquo;s sentiments were contrary to plans by Deputy President William Ruto to ensure Jubilee wins the seat, and politically weaken Gideon ahead of his 2022 bid for the presidency.Last year, Ruto prevailed upon Betting Control and Licensing Board director Simon Chelugui to shelve his gubernatorial ambitions and face-off with the Senator in this year's general election.Read: &lsquo;DP didn&rsquo;t force Chelugui to drop from governor race&rsquo;Mandago said on Wednesday that the National Super Alliance will have no impact in Rift Valley even if Gideon and Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto (CCM) join.He said Rutto, Moi and other Rift Valley leaders backing Nasa were committing political suicide. Leaders who joined forces to formed the super coalition included Raila Odinga (ODM), Moses Wetang'ula (Ford Kenya), Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper) and Musalia Mudavadi (Amani).&ldquo;Rift Valley is a Jubilee stronghold. Nasa is wasting time campaigning in this region. We made our decision; that we belong to Jubilee and nothing will change that," said Mandago.The Governor said Rutto and Gideon should also stop thinking they can upstage Ruto in Rift Valley politics.&ldquo;We are behind Jubilee, President Uhuru Kenyatta and Ruto. Kanu or the so-called CCM have no place in this region and should not be allowed to confuse anyone," he said.Read: Baringo residents don't need DP Ruto's leadership - Ole MpakaAlso read: Ruto dictatorial, meddling in Rift Valley politics, Baringo Kanu MCAs sayNasa held its first rally in Bomet last week amid speculation that Rutto would eventually join the Opposition.But Mandago told the Governor to tread carefully when it comes to politics and joint he super alliance at his own risk.He said the Opposition will be allowed to campaign anywhere but that its leaders must know they will not change the political stand already taken by the people of Rift Valley.The Governor said Jubilee&rsquo;s performance was clear and that people across the country have benefited from programmes initiated by the government.Top political leaders from the region, led by former ministers Henry Kosgey and Nicholas Biwott, have assured Ruto that they will not allow the Opposition to find its footing in the region.&ldquo;We are looking at 2022 polls. This year it is a done deal. We will back Jubilee; the DP should not have any worries concerning that," said Kosgey.Mandago has also urged those who will lose in Jubilee nominations to remain in the party and back winners because they will be rewarded with other government positions. &ldquo;The nominations will be free and fair and after that we should move together so that Jubilee wins on August 8," he said.The Governor spoke at a meeting of Kalenjin and Kikuyu community elders on county politics.The elders led by Retired Major John Seii and Joseph Keriri said communities in the region must ensure peace prevails during the election period.
