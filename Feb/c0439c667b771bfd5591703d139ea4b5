Sharp differences in a parliamentary watchdog panel over sanctions on key suspects in the NYS scandal are delaying the adopting of a crucial report.There are also claims that the committee is under pressure to delay the tabling of the report to ensure it is brought before the House at the tail end of the Session.This is part of a scheme by some 'shadowy' forces to block its debate in the current session as its details would negatively affect political fortunes of some key and influential individuals mentioned.The Star has established that members of the Public Accounts Committee are yet to agree on whether or not to indict some influential figures said to have been found culpable.The committee chaired by Rarienda MP Nicholas Gumbo has concluded a draft report, which one of the members of the committee described as &lsquo;a mega fraud&rsquo;, but have differed on far-reaching recommendations.&ldquo;We have said that we will not be part of a fraud on Kenyans. Some members want culprits set scot-free,&rdquo; said a senior member of the committee who sought anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.The Panel retreated three weeks ago to write its report in Mombasa, but after three days at the coastal town, flew back to Nairobi without a common position.During the meeting members are said to have taken hardline position that some influential figures implicated be spared from indictment.&ldquo;The committee&rsquo;s work is not a cleansing exercise, we are paid by the taxpayers and will not accept any ,monkey business," the member said.The member said part of the reason for the deadlock include names of former CS Anne Waiguru, Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen and Farouk Kibet an aide to Deputy President William Ruto."Once you mention Waiguru or Murkomen members take political positions neither wants people from their camp implicated," said the member. Another member told the Star on the phone that the panel has "lost steam" and may not get to the bottom of the matter regarding the colossal theft which shook the country.The amount of money lost was initially put at Sh791 million, but investigations by PAC discovered that more than Sh1.8 billion could have disappeared into thin air at the height of the mega scam. "The matter is largely about Waiguru, nothing less, nothing more," the member said.It is feared that should the committee implicate Waiguru and recommend that she be barred from holding public office, the sanction may open the pandora's box."Remember she mentioned the powers that be in the land," another member said.Waiguru, a former powerful CS, exited from the helm of the ministry in a huff after she was adversely mentioned in connection with the loss of Sh791 million.Despite putting up a spirited fight against the claims that she oversaw the brazen theft of public funds, the former influential minister threw in the towel and quit office, blaming a &ldquo;mysterious puppeteer for her woes.&rdquo;While appearing before the committee to give evidence, Waiguru pointedly named an aide to Deputy President William Ruto &ndash; Farouk Kibet &ndash; as one of the people who were allegedly communicating with her persecutors.She said the &ldquo;puppeteer&rdquo; was working with a network to fix her over the theft of public funds at NYS, giant docket under her while CS.
