Mid-tier lender Ecobank hopes to cut costs by more than 15 per cent in its local unit this year after transferring key services to digital banking. The regional lender officially launched its unified digital banking platform in Nairobi yesterday, moving closer to the plan in which it will close nine of its 29 branches in the country.The branches that are scheduled to close this year include Chambers, Ongata Rongai, Gikomba, Embakasi, Thika Road Mall, Meru, Kitale, Busia and Malindi.The lender says the digital banking model will be adopted in all the 36 African countries that it has operations.&ldquo;Year-on-year we are seeking to be much more lean in operations and efficient in services. So if we can achieve a 15 per cent drop in our costs, it would be an excellent outcome,&rdquo; Humphrey Muturi, the bank&rsquo;s executive director and head of commercial banking in East Africa, said in an interview in Nairobi.Top lenders such as Kenya Commercial Bank, Equity Group and Cooperative Bank have already moved most of their transactions to digital platforms. This is attributed to changing customers&rsquo; banking trends, which have declared the death of the bank branches transaction channel. Other lenders which have adopted technology driven strategies include Sidian Bank, Family Bank and Bank of Africa.Muturi said the decision to close the nine branches was made last year after reviewing the business model.However, it's not yet clear how many employees will be affected by the digital shift.&ldquo;The digital mobile application will take over most of our back-end operations but we will still have a lot of human activity front-end operations,&rdquo; he said, noting &ldquo;the application has some key superior features&rdquo;.Ecobank was founded in Togo in 1985 and has over the past three decades expanded to other 35 African countries. It has operated in the Kenyan market for eight years and turned profitable last year.Muturi said the platform has a dozen functionalities which range from airtime purchase, funds transfer, merchant services, card services, check services and other account services. &ldquo;We see many benefits in the mobile app. The main one is convenience and cost saving for the customers,&rdquo; he said.
