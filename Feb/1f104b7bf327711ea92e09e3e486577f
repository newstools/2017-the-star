Wiper national chairman David Musila appears not to be resting easy following a recent political development in his party over the Kitui governor race.Musila appears to be mulling over ditching Wiper to ensure he is in the race in the August 8 polls. Addressing a public rally at Nuu Market in Mwingi Central subcounty on Monday, Musila said his options are not limited.He said he is at liberty to vie for the Kitui governor seat on a different ticket, despite being the party chairman. &ldquo;You have heard me say I can vie on any political party ticket. It is because I will not stomach [Kitui Governor Julius] Malombe saying he enjoys [Wiper leader] Kalonzo&rsquo;s backing,&rdquo; he said.Musila added that &ldquo;We all belong to the Wiper Party. I am the chairman but there are some disruptions that would make us tell you to vote for whoever you like.&rdquo;
