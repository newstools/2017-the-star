Police have information that will lead to establishing the truth behind the death of an AP officer who was guarding the residence of National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi.Addressing mourners at Hamisi Stadium in Vihiga, police commander Jones Kavoi, who is in charge of security of government buildings, said investigations into the death of Dismas Masitsa are at an advanced stage.Kavoi said National Police Service Commission chairman Johnston Kavuludi is not taking the matter lightly.He said, &ldquo;All the guns belonging to Masista and his colleague are with the CID.&rdquo;A postmortem revealed that Masitsa was shot dead with a pistol after a scuffle on February 11. A fellow AP officer arrested over the killing had been issued with an AK47 rifle on the night of the attack. The weapon has since been taken for ballistics examination. Kavoi said, &ldquo;The two officers had worked together for a very long time and we are yet to know what happened. The two did not fight because Masitsa&rsquo;s gun was fully loaded unlike his colleague&rsquo;s gun, which had spent cartridges.&rdquo;Muturi&rsquo;s message was read by Major (Rtd) Solomon Obange, who is in charge of Parliament Security. He said the death of the man who guarded his door was like a spear across his heart.He said, &ldquo;Masitsa&rsquo;s death while in the line of duty was shocking and unbelievable.&rdquo;
