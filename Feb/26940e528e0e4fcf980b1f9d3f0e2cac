Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo yesterday said he will oppose a parallel anti-betting bill sponsored by the government.He is the sponsor of the Betting and Control Bill, but the government last week said it will introduce its own bill to regulate the gaming and betting industry.Midiwo said only amendments from the government-sponsored bill&ndash;the draft Gambling Bill and Regulations which was presented before the National Assembly&rsquo;s Labour and Social Welfare committee by Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery last week&ndash;would be allowed to enrich his bill.&ldquo;This is a party [ODM] sponsored bill and there is no way the government will be allowed to sneak in its bill and take over our initiative,&rdquo; he said.Midiwo&rsquo;s bill was tabled in the House two weeks ago and is now before the Labour committee, chaired by Matungu MP David Were. It will be subjected to stakeholder involvement.
