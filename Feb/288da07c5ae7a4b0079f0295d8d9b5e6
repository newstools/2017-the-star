The High Court has declared unconstitutional the Senate&rsquo;s decision to probe the Kiambu County Supplementary Appropriations Bill, 2015. Justice Chacha Mwita said the decision was unlawful to the extent that the Senate bestows on itself functions that are outside its authority, citing Article 96 of the Constitution. He said the legislative power of the county governments is vested in the county assemblies.The court was required to determine the constitutionality of a decision by the Senate to examine the process of enactment, legality and constitutionality of the Kiambu County Supplementary Appropriations Bill, 2015. The Kiambu county government and the Council of Governors filed the case in 2015.Their petition raised some fundamental issues on whether or not under the provisions of Article 96 of the Constitution, the Senate can scrutinise the process and legality of county legislation. Their position was that the Senate&rsquo;s role is limited to revenue allocated to the counties and does not cover grants, loans and revenues generated locally. On May 20, 2015, the Senate Speaker directed the committee on Finance, Commerce and Budget to probe the Bill&rsquo;s passage.
