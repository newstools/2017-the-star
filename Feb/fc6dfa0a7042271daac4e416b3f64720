Elected leaders in Nyandarua are sabotaging the mass voter registration and deliberately failing the President by not encouraging residents to vote, three leaders have said.Elected leaders have stayed away from vote registration drives, leaving the work to aspirants, Ndaragwa MP aspirants Moses Ndegwa, Kimone Kariuki and George Gachigua said.They spoke at ACK Hall, Ol Kalou, during a meeting convened by Nyandarua JP Officials to discuss how to improve low registration turnout.Apart from a few MCAs, many elected leaders skipped the meeting.Ndegwa, who also chairs the JP Nyandarua Aspirants&rsquo; Caucus, said all aspirants and incumbent leaders were invited to the function.&ldquo;We wonder where they were. Don&rsquo;t they know there are so many unregistered voters in Nyandarua?&rdquo; he asked.Ndegwa said that it is &ldquo;disturbing and shameful&rdquo; for incumbent leaders to skip a meeting that seeks solutions to increase their votes.Gachigua said the elected leaders are only waiting for the JP nominations date to be announced so they can come out and &ldquo;pretend they are more Jubilee than others&rdquo;.Kariuki said even the President does not trust the incumbent leaders, which is why he is using the Mt Kenya Foundation to mobilise voters.He said these leaders will only appear and be seen &ldquo;queuing to greet the President and be photographed with him&rdquo; when he visits Nyandarua. Then they appear as though they are doing what is expected of them. Kariuki added.&ldquo;They are the ones who sit with the President, yet, they are nowhere to be seen as we mobilise voters to register for his reelection,&rdquo; he said.
