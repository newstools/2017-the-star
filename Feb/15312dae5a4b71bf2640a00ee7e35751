Deputy President William Ruto yesterday told the opposition to declare its stand on the war on drugs.He said Jubilee has built a drug rehabilitation centre at the Coast General Hospital. &ldquo;Drugs have been messing up Mombasa [youth],&rdquo; Ruto said in Changamwe. The DP indirectly accused a Mombasa politician of enriching himself with the drugs business. &ldquo;Will you give me a Jubilee governor?... &lsquo;Wale wenye biashara ya Sigalame waende nyumbani&rsquo; (those doing Sigalame business should go home),&rdquo; he said. Sigalame is code for smuggling.National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale accused the opposition of going to bed with drug lords, remaining mute and to some extent shielding them. &ldquo;If you are a drug baron, you have no place in Jubilee,&rdquo; he said.Duale said this year&rsquo;s contest will be between drug lords and those fighting to wipe out the drug barons.ODM leader Raila Odinga has been asked to speak out on the menace.His ally and ODM deputy party leader Hassan Joho was on Sunday mentioned by a local newspaper as among the people whose files are being reviewed by the Drug Enforcement Administration of the US.Investigators are reported to be looking afresh at the files of Kenyan big names cited in an American Embassy report made public six years ago. The report was handed to then Internal Security minister George Saitoti.But last year in an interview with a local TV Station, Joho, also the Mombasa Governor, denied cutting corners to acquire wealth. He dismissed as propaganda claims that he engages in the drug trade. &ldquo;Those behind the dirty politics aimed at mudslinging my name will never succeed,&rdquo; Joho said. The county boss dismissed as false reports that Mombasa has about 100,000 drug addicts. He said he has been in the forefront in the war on drugs.
