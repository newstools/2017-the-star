A section of Rift Valley youth have accused lawyer Gitobu Imanyara of tainting the image of DP William Ruto.The Youth Leaders Forum say some individuals are using Imanyara to fufil personal vendetta against Ruto.They questioned why Imanyara was being used by people of a lower political reputation than Ruto to "file senseless cases" against the DP."Why is it that this man is always being used to advance negative information about the DP? Court cases against the DP by his detractors are also synonymous with him," said group secretary Michael Simbolei.He told the lawyer to "stick to his lane and stop being used by political enemies of the Deputy President out to taint his image"."The other time he filed a case against DP Ruto with [activist] Boniface Mwangi. We want to remind him that what is about to befall him is worse than 'face mount Kenya lyrics'," he said.More on this: Activist Boniface Mwangi denies defaming DP RutoRead: Ruto sues Boniface Mwangi for linking him to Jacob Juma deathSimbolei said Ruto's political enemies fear that he is a rising star and were out to deter him from becoming the next president in 2022.
