Outgoing National Assembly clerk Justin Bundi yesterday gave an emotional speech in Mombasa during his last parliamentary retreat. The 60-year-old career civil servant who is due to retire on March 21, told MPs "I will miss you badly when I leave Parliament, but will not forget your immense role in my career.&rdquo; MPs have already approved deputy clerk Michel Rotich Sialai as his successor. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m satisfied that I&rsquo;m leaving the leadership of the National Assembly in very capable hands. Sialai is a leader,&rdquo; he said at the Serena Hotel. &ldquo;I leave behind a team of young, dedicated and energetic people, highly trained and qualified.&rdquo;
