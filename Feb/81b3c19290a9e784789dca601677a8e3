ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi and Ford Kenya&rsquo;s Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula provide the best chance to end Luhya disunity, which has cost them the presidency, Prof Frank Matanga yesterday said.&ldquo;Assuming they eventually work closely together from now on, they have the greatest chance to end the rivalry between the Maragoli and Bukusu sub-tribes. The disunity has greatly cost the community in the past,&rdquo; he said.Analyst Martin Andati said that the presence of Mudavadi and Wetang&rsquo;ula in NASA is a double-edged sword.&ldquo;It can be beneficial to the community in the battle for NASA ticket if they agree on one of them because the NASA coordinating committee has six of their nominees out of the 12 members,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;It can also be counterproductive if their nominees support [a non-Luhya] .&rdquo;
