Kenya&rsquo;s economy is expected to grow at between five and 5.6 per cent in 2017, supported by increased government spending and resilient performance in transport, trade and tourism.Britam Asset Managers yesterday said unfavourable weather, subdued credit growth, but underscored soaring macro space will remain a risk to the country&rsquo;s growth.The government needs to grow its expenditure by the targeted 16.4 per cent this fiscal year and to achieve the expected 17.6 per cent increase in revenues, in order to meet the projected economic growth. The government must, therefore, spend to sustain gross domestic product growth above 5.0 per cent in 2017.&ldquo;Kenya has one of the most dynamic and well-diversified economies in the Sub-Saharan African region, helping it weather many of the shocks that have beset the region. We expect GDP growth of five per cent &ndash; 5.6 per cent in 2017,&rdquo; Britam Asset Managers chief executive Kenneth Kaniu said at a media briefing.The Central Bank on Monday downgraded its growth forecast to 5.7 per cent in 2017 from 5.9 per cent last year, citing uncertainties in the economy amid a ravaging drought.Agriculture is expected to generate less output following a prolonged period of dry weather which has hit the food-producing regions of the country.The CBK governor Patrick Njoroge says it remains unclear how the economy will react after Britain starts the process of leaving the European Union following the June 23 referendum vote popularly known as the Brexit. This is coupled with uncertainties over the direction of US policy under the new government of Donald Trump.However, the forecast did not indicate whether the economy will be affected by the August 8 general election, though independent economists expect the polls to have a negative effect. &ldquo;There are increased uncertainties with regard to the prevailing drought conditions and risks in the global markets,&rdquo; the governor saidHowever, Britam attributes the sluggish growth in the private sector to the introduction of the law capping bank interest rates in 2016, with the sector posting a slowed growth of four per cent in quarter four, from 18 per cent in a similar period in 2015. The report recommends that the government should keep directing most of its foreign debt towards development expenditure to meet future interest payments, noting the country&rsquo;s external debt has steadily increased from 18.9 per cent, as a percentage of GDP in 2010 to 25.6 per cent as at June 2016.
