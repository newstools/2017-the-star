Nyeri MCAs have been criticised for attempting to impeach the late Nyeri Governor Nderitu Gachagua when he was ailing.Council of Governors chairman Peter Munya yesterday said, &ldquo;The MCAs wanted to stop county business by impeaching the ailing governor. Some were fighting for individual interests, instead of offering services to their people. Anyway, let bygones be bygones.&rdquo; He spoke yesterday during the swearing in of Samuel Wamathai. Munya called for unity to give Gachagua a decent send-off. He also urged MCAs to support the new governor.Gachagua&rsquo;s younger brother Rigathi told speaker Mwangi Mugo - who spoke well of the late governor - he should have made the remarks when he was alive.&ldquo;We need to change this culture of speaking kind words when somebody has passed on,&rdquo; he said.Munya described Gachagua as a coffee farmer champion. He said Gachagua fought for farmers to get good pay when he was the chairman of the Agriculture committee in the Council of Governors. Gachagua died at the Royal Marsden Hospital in London last Friday after a short illness.
