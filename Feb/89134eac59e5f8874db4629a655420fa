Picture this: You have lost your Internet service for six months. This means going for months with no email, no social media &ndash; you are basically cut off from the rest of the world.At this point, you begin to realise that Internet is far more than just a luxury and actually, many lives depend on it.Well, Bill Gates also believes many of the lives being lost unnecessarily to diseases and birth-related complications could be saved with affordable Internet access.Gates says his foundation currently uses SMS to reach rural Kenyan women with important health information, because these women have no Internet.The information include reminders for vaccination of their children or dates for family planning appointments.&ldquo;Over time we hope to the 3G network is cheaper enough and our phones are popular enough that we can even use (mobile) applications,&rdquo; he told the Star.Bill says the Foundation continues to track the 3G coverage map in Kenya and other countries.Currently, the foundation has made arrangements with service providers so that broadcast SMS carrying health messages do not attract premium charges.Bill granted interview with the Star and select African media houses after releasing his annual letter for 2017.He hopes Internet charges will come down significantly in the next five years, just like it happened in India.&ldquo;What happens is that the way governments license the networks. They need to make sure the fees are very competitive. In the urban areas the cost of building those networks are quite low per user and therefore if you're asking companies to work in rural areas, are they subsidised to do that or do they charge a higher price?&rdquo; he told the Star.In this year&rsquo;s letter, Bill and his wife Melinda highlight their optimism about progress in global health.It is actually a response to a letter that Warren Buffet sent them on December 12 last year, asking about the effectiveness of his investment in the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation ten years ago.Bill Gates 2017 letter is a response to a letter (above) that Warren Buffet sent them on December 12 last year, asking about the effectiveness of his investment in the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation ten years ago.The couple explains that the money, together with their own donation, has saved the lives of 122 million children since 1990, through sustained reduction in childhood deaths.Most of the investment has been channeled to initiatives that benefit Africa, where most lives have also been saved.&ldquo;Warren, your gift doubled the foundation&rsquo;s resources. It&rsquo;s allowed us to expand our work in US education, support small-holder farmers, and create financial services for the poor. But in this letter, we&rsquo;re going to tell you about our work in global health&mdash;because that was the starting point of our philanthropy, and it&rsquo;s the majority of what we do,&rdquo; the letter says.Bill told the Star that some of these financial services for the poor have been implemented in Kenya, including saving schemes through Mpesa.&ldquo;Use of mobile phones is advantageous not just for health but for many other things. Our foundation is involved in getting people to use Mpesa. We are also tracking how women using it. We are also encouraging women to save using that,&rdquo; he said.Bill also noted the foundation is the biggest non-government donor to Global Fund, which funds most of HIV, TB, and Malaria treatment in Kenya.The letter carries a veiled reference to the Donald Trump's reinstatement of the rule that prohibits recipients of US foreign aid money to promote or provide abortion services.Health advocates say that rule threatens the Melinda Gates-led Family Planning 2020 partnership.The initiative aims to give 120 million more women across the world - including possibly millions of Kenyans - access to contraceptives by 2020.&ldquo;Our letter is being released amid dramatic political transitions in these countries, including new leadership in the United States and the United Kingdom. We hope this story will remind everyone why foreign aid should remain a priority&mdash;because by lifting up the poorest, we express the highest values of our nations,&rdquo; say the Gates in the introduction. &ldquo;One of the greatest of those values is the belief that the best investment any of us can ever make is in the lives of others.&rdquo;National Aids Control Council Director Dr Nduku Kilonzo (Left) with Bill Gates, Founder and Chair of Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, in South Africa during the 2016 International Aids Society conference.The letter generally conveys optimism on the possibility of ending poverty and explains the need to address poverty together with gender inequities, because women with the same opportunities as men will help societies thrive.In the interview following the letter's release, Bill advised men to be involved in reproductive health and help lift the lives of their wives.&ldquo;Having men involved can have a huge impact. They should join their women to be part of a self help group and share information with each other. As a group they have a voice to give feedback when the health or education system is not providing the right services,&rdquo; he said.Bill and Melinda Gates have written an annual letter for the past several years. The goal of these annual letters is to broaden awareness and interest in key global health and development programmes.
