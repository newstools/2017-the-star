Nominated Senator Emma Mbura will decamp from Jubilee tomorrow and announce the political party she intends to use to wrest the Rabai MP seat from William Kamoti.Yesterday she said Jubilee will not hold free and fair primaries. Mbura has fallen out with Kilifi North MP Gideon Mung&rsquo;aro, who is the Jubilee point man at the Coast.She said she has been frustrated by the party&rsquo;s leadership and accused the party of preferring weaker candidates to her.Speaking on the phone, Mbura said Deputy President William Ruto at one point wanted to endorse former JAP chairman Nelson Ndzuya for the seat, but she stood firm and received enormous support from residents, thus,scuttling the plan. &ldquo;I stole the show and [the] DP failed to endorse him. At a second rally, they also found I was the one with massive support,&rdquo; she said.Mbura said JP tried to back another aspirant, Amir Mwinyi, but the plans flopped. She said the JP leadership has now picked ODM MCA Anthony Kenga to run for the seat. Mbura said she cannot bear the frustrations any more and has decided to seek shelter in another party.&ldquo;Up to last week, Kenga was insulting JP, calling them thieves. All of a sudden, he has been picked. Why should I wait to be bundled out?&rdquo; she said.
