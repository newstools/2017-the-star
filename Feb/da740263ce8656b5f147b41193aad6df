Bomet Governor Isaac Ruto (pictured) has said Jubilee leaders plan on disrupting the Nasa rally planned for tomorrow in Bomet, a claim that the county commissioner has denied.Ruto, who spoke to the Star yesterday, said Jubilee politicians are using county commissioner Bernard Leparmarai to create mayhem, adding that everyone has a right to campaign in any part of the country.&ldquo;The county commissioner held two meetings in his office planning how to create chaos on Saturday,&rdquo; said Ruto, whose Chama Cha Mashinani party is expected to work with Nasa.&ldquo;The initial plan was to have demonstrations in Bomet town, denouncing Nasa leadership and appealing to the people not to attend the rally, while portraying the region as a Jubilee stronghold,&rdquo; the governor said.On Tuesday, Nasa leaders Raila Odinga (ODM), Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper), Musalia Mudavadi (ANC) and Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula of Ford Kenya said they have been invited by Rutto, who will host the inaugural Nasa rally.The governor said he has suspended all other engagements in preparation for the rally. He termed Jubilee leadership a disaster that is confused and not committed to devolution, the rule of law and constitutionalism.&ldquo;The Nasa rally will be filled to capacity. Don&rsquo;t hate Raila. You didn&rsquo;t give birth to him,&rdquo; Rutto said.Leparmarai termed the governor&rsquo;s claims as nonsense and said the meeting he had was purely for the maintenance of law and order during the Nasa rally. &ldquo; If indeed he has that information, he should report to the police,&rdquo; Leparmarai said.
