Kenyan Premier League chairman James Musyoki has maintained that Football Kenya Federation will not succeed in determining which teams will feature in the 2017 Sportpesa Premier League &lsquo;without following the due process as far as &lsquo;relegation and promotion&rsquo; is concerned.Musyoki, who is among the four officials, whom the FKF National Executive Committee instituted disciplinary actions against on Tuesday, said the issue that has brought about the latest disagreement between the two bodies has nothing to do with an 18-team league.&ldquo;The matter right now is not about whether we have an 18-team league or not. What we are concerned with is relegation and promotion and the going by the manner in which the federation is handling this issue, they will not succeed,&rdquo; said Musyoki.KPL CEO Jack Oguda, another of the officials pinpointed for disciplinary action by FKF alongside Mathare United&rsquo;s Bob Munro and Gor Mahia&rsquo;s Ambrose Rachier, said he was not aware of the charges being preferred against him hence could not respond to issues raised in the media.&ldquo;I have not received any communication from the federation and therefore I do not know the charges that have been brought against me. I cannot comment on the matter,&rdquo; said Oguda.FKF boss Nick Mwendwa alluded to Oguda failing to invite Nzoia United to KPL meetings as among the issues the KPL boss is expected to explain before the federation&rsquo;s disciplinary committee.The officials were scheduled to honour a meeting called by the federation at the auspices of the Sports Disputes Tribunal chaired by John Ohaga yesterday in a bid to solve matters siurrounding the league composition. &ldquo;We will of course attend the meeting and see what comes out of it,&rdquo; Oguda said.FKF, in reaction to the league&rsquo;s Governing Council releasing fixtures with 16 teams and including Sofapaka and Muhoroni Youth&mdash;clubs that ostensibly didn&rsquo;t meet the club licensing requirements&mdash;suspended the start of the 2017 season.The league was due to kick off this weekend but the federation warned clubs, players and match officials against involving themselves in the scheduled matches until matters raised by the federation are addressed and a common ground found.
