This might be the reason for the deaths,&rdquo; he said.Only overalls, gumbootsThe worker said his colleagues did not wear protective gear, saying they only wore overalls and gumboots. &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t have protective masks, we suspect they fell unconscious after inhaling gas,&rdquo; he said.The bodies were retrieved by workers.
