TSC has directed that extracurriculum activities that require teachers&rsquo; involvement be scheduled on weekends, not weekdays. &ldquo;No office is open on Saturdays and Sundays, including that of (CS Fred) Matiang&rsquo;i. Let co-curriculum activities be done like before. We shall not succumb to such machinations,&rdquo; Knut Teso secretary Deogracious Owaya said on Wednesday.
