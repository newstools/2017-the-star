The owner of a Probox in which four murdered men were found on Tuesday night in Gitaru, Kikuyu subcounty, has been arrested. The men had been stranguled and abandoned in the car at a garage. Kabete OCPD Joseph Ongaya said on the phone yesterday two victims were in the boot while the others were in the back seat. &ldquo;We were informed by members of the public of a Toyota Probox with tinted windows. They reported that it had been there since morning, [and they] suspected [it had been abandoned] on Tuesday night. The report was made at the evening and we proceeded there to check,&rdquo; he said. Ongaya said the men appeared to have been hit with a blunt object on their foreheads and the necks had what appeared to be strangulation marks. &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t have identification documents in their pockets. The bodies were taken to City Mortuary, where autopsies will be conducted and their fingerprints be used to identify them,&rdquo; he said. Ongaya thanked wananchi for providing the information, saying it was useful.
