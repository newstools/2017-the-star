Leaders of the wrangle-ridden Kenya National Union of Nurses take their supremacy battle to the courts today.This could ground the ongoing CBA negotiations. Secretary general Seth Panyako will defend himself before Justice Monica Mbaru for alleged abuse of office. Panyako is accused of embezzling the union&rsquo;s money with his &lsquo;second wife&rsquo;, and misusing members&rsquo; property to fund his campaigns for the Kakamega Senate seat. Separately, union chairman John Biiy will press new charges against Panyako and the union&rsquo;s National Executive Council, who claimed to have sacked him last Friday. Joseph Ngwasi, the deputy national chairman, was appointed the acting national chairman, deputised by Fredrick Oigo. Biiy had obtained orders from Labour Court Justice Hellen Wasilwa barring the officials from convening the Friday disciplinary meeting.&ldquo;We successfully served the orders to Panyako&rsquo;s lawyer, but they went ahead and convened a meeting illegally. We will sue them for contempt of court and also have those decisions declared null and void,&rdquo; Biiy told the Star.The union&rsquo;s NEC claimed he has been sabotaging the ongoing talks to formulate a Collective Bargaining Agreement.Biiy defended himself, saying he was no longer in the CBA negotiation team, and accused Panyako of a witch-hunt.&ldquo;We have not received any orders from the court barring us from taking such a disciplinary action. Usually, anyone who is not satisfied with the council&rsquo;s decision has 21 days to appeal,&rdquo; Panyako said.The wrangles started last December, when the negotiation team, led by Biiy, successfully brokered a new nursing service allowance of between Sh15,000 and Sh20,000 for all nurses.They then called off the strike to give way for comprehensive talks with the government on a CBA.Panyako protested, saying only the National Governing Council could call off a strike.He expelled Biiy and three other officials from the CBA negotiations team.Earlier last week, Biiy swore an affidavit accusing Panyako of embezzling the union&rsquo;s money.Labour Court judge Monica Mbaru temporarily stripped Panyako of his position as general secretary, but he obtained orders to stay the decision until today.
