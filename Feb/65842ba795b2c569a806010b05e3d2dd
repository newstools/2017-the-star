State House spokesman Manoah Esipisu yesterday criticised the opposition over its continued attack on the government.Esipisu, who accompanied Education PS Belio Kipsang&rsquo; on a tour of Vihiga schools, accused the opposition of peddling lies over the Jubilee administration&rsquo;s performance.&ldquo;Allow me to say something on politics. I speak for the President who is a politician. The President is building schools and connecting electricity to grassroots areas,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The government has installed electricity in schools as part of the plan to effect the laptop project for schools.&rdquo;Esipisu urged the media to write about lies from opposition leaders without interrogating them.&ldquo;When they say their lies, tell them the government is initiating projects and implementing them,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;They keep saying people from Western have not been appointed to serve in government. I come from Vihiga. My home is a few kilometres from here [St Bakhita&rsquo;s Girls, Ebusiratsi]. Special programmes PS Josepta Mukobe comes from around hear. The director in her department comes from around.&rdquo;Esipisu and Kipsang&rsquo; assured residents the laptop project is on course and will be fully implemented by April. The project has been delayed over tendering row, but Kipsang&rsquo; said 90 per cent of the gadgets have arrived and will soon be distributed. They gave Bunyore Girls and St Bakhita&rsquo;s Girls 20 computers each.
