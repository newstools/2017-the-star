Three men were killed in a horrific attack at a hotel in Garissa town yesterday.A gang is suspected to have gained access into Kilas Food Court at 3am and killed the three with blunt objects while they were sleeping.Nothing was stolen.The trio, two of them brothers, were hit on the head and may have died due to excessive bleeding.The mattress they were sleeping on was soaked in blood and their phones were in their hands, which, some officers said, indicates they were trying to make frantic calls.One worker escaped with injuries and is admitted at the Garissa County Referral Hospital.The three murdered men were identified as Kassim Rashid, a guard, and waiters Abdisalan Ibrahim and Salat Salah.It is still unclear how the killers gained access into the hotel without being detected as the building has a perimeter wall.Garissa county commissioner James Kianda said they are investigating.He described the murder as heinous and urged the public to remain calm and volunteer information that will assist in solving the crime and prosecuting the killers.&ldquo;We are treating this incident as a normal crime. We urge members of the public to stop speculations during this electioneering period,&rdquo; Kianda said.The bodies were examined by a doctor and released to the families for burial in accordance with Islamic rites.
