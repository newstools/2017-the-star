Turbo MP Elisha Busienei has sacked his two aides for demanding bribes from his constituents in order to get bursaries and contracts. Busienei claimed his personal assistant and another aide at the CDF office had been frustrating the constituents with the demands.He said the aides had been claiming that the he was the one who sent them to collect the Sh2,000 that the two were fond of asking for."I gave one of them 30 forms to take to the constituents to apply so that they can go to college but instead he demanded Sh2,000 from each of them," Busienei said.The MP said there was no way he could demand for cash from poor people who want assistance in the constituency."I had already cautioned them that as my staff, I should not hear of such nonsense but they went ahead to do it. So, I fired them," he said.He said another aide had been collecting money from contractors. "He told the contractors that I was the one who needed the money but that was not true and I have also sacked him," Busienei said.The MP said he had reported the matter to the police for investigations.But some residents said the MP was aware that his aides had been frustrating locals for long."The MP is just pretending because he knows elections are around the corner. We have reported many times to him about the aides but he took no action," a constituent said.However, Busienei denied the claims saying he took action immediately he received the complaints from members of the public.
