The drought crisis in Garissa county has disrupted learning as parents move with their children in search of water and pasture for themselves and their livestock.In some areas, the Education ministry has teamed up with NGOs to set up mobile schools.On Tuesday, Lagdera deputy subcounty Education officer Ibrahim Odowa said school enrolment has declined drastically.&ldquo;The dwindling pasture and water deficit has forced parents to move. At times like this, pastoralists prioritise looking after their animals over educating their children,&rdquo; he said.In Lagdera subcounty there are three mobile schools - Geylab, Garse and Kona Yarrow.When the Star visited the Geylab mobile school, it found few children learning in a makeshift structure.Teacher Absame Gure said the daily turnout is low.&ldquo;Transporting learning materials, including blackboards and charts to where the pastoralists migrate is one of the biggest challenges in running the mobile schools,&rdquo; he said.He added, &ldquo;Sometimes, you are left alone as parents have withdrawn their children from school and travelled to different locations. Even if you were to follow them, you wouldn&rsquo;t get enough children to teach.&rdquo;
