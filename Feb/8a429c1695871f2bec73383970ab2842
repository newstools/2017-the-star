Cracks have emerged in Wiper, triggered by leader Kalonzo Musyoka&rsquo;s preference for some candidates.Party chairman David Musila has written to Kalonzo expressing his displeasure after he was urged to drop his bid for Kitui governor and instead support Governor Julius Malombe&rsquo;s reelection.Kalonzo later clarified all aspirants will have to square it out in the nominations, saying there are no favoured hopefuls. Musila, Machakos Senator Johnson Muthama and several MPs have complained about the endorsement of various candidates in Ukambani by Kalonzo.In Kitui, the eight MPs have rebelled against Malombe.The MPs indicated they would endorse Musila as their leader and shop for a new political vehicle, because Wiper may deny them nominations.Some of the MPs are National Assembly minority leader Francis Nyenze, Charles Nyamai (Kitui Rural), Makali Mulu (Kitui Central ) and Ben Kitungi of Mwingi West. In the past, they were Kalonzo die-hards.The MPs are also unhappy with how Kalonzo hand-picked Farah Maalim from ODM and appointed him Wiper deputy party leader without the approval of the National Executive Council.They are also unhappy with the composition of the party elections board and have rejected the nominees.
