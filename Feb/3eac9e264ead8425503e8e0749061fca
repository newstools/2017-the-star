The Nairobi government has been barred from demanding parking fees from a property belonging to the Catholic Church.High Court judge George Odunga issued orders prohibiting the county officials from demanding and collecting parking fees from cars parked inside St Peter Claver&rsquo;s Church on Race Course Road.&ldquo;It is clear that the respondent (county government) has not justified its action against the applicant (church). Based on the only evidence before me, I find that the respondent has no power to levy fees on the suit property. By purporting to do so, the respondent exceeded its jurisdiction and its decision must therefore be quashed,&rdquo; he said.The church went to court after the county government clamped vehicles parked at St Peter Claver&rsquo;s Primary School, disrupting learning on October 13, 2016. The land in question also houses the church and the priest&rsquo;s residence.According to suit papers, county officials had invaded the property on June 29, 2011, June 7, 2012, and March 17, 2015, and clamped vehicles.Aggrieved by this action the church wrote to the county government (the City Council of Nairobi at that time) on two occasions, but its plea to have the matter resolved was ignored.
