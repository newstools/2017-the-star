In December 2016, NGO Co-ordination Board chairman Fazul Mohamed suspended activities of the Foundation until its directors submit audited accounts for the past four years.Read:Kidero foundation deregistered, NGO board demands auditThe Foundation however said that it filed all its financial returns and submitted the same to Kenya Revenue Authority, contrary to the Board's assertion.Mohamed said that the Foundation opened and operated unauthorized bank accounts and its directors were officials of Nairobi City County government.He advised the asset recovery agency to audit all assets under the foundation."The Central Bank of Kenya, the Financial Reporting Centre and the Family Bank Kilimani branch are advised to preserve all funds held under the Evans Kidero Foundation until further communication from this office," the letter continues.The Board accused the foundation of transacting millions of shillings within the period under review yet it has no stipulated donors.But the Lawyer Otieno said that the organization started before Kidero was elected the Governor and even the directors were employed by City Hall.He said the Foundation had only Sh41,000 in its bank account at the time the Board raised the financial irregularities last December.
