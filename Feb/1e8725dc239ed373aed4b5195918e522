Knut boss Wilson Sossion has asked teachers to defy the TSC circular which requires them to teach on Saturdays and Sundays.Sossion said the directive by the Teachers Service Commission was null and void as the union was not consulted.&ldquo;We will not be turned into slaves. We must rest and have time to go to church,&rdquo; he said, adding they also needed to spend time with their families.&ldquo;Boycott and defy such unprofessional circulars until the union officials are properly consulted."The secretary general spoke at Mamboleo in Kisumu on Saturday where he unveiled the Sh26 million Kisumu Burial and Benevolent Fund Building.He was with union officials including assistant secretary generals Hesbon Otieno and Collins Oyuu.Sossion dared the government to harass or intimidate members of the union over circulars sent without following procedure, saying the consequence will be a national strike.He questioned the TSC's mode of communicating with teachers saying they only learn of circulars from the Education ministry on social media.&ldquo;We must be professionals. When did the commission start to communicate to teachers through social media?" he asked.The Knut boss added that directives must be discussed by teachers&rsquo; unions and all other relevant parties, and should not be approved if rejected.Sossion further took issue with Education CS Fred Matiang&rsquo;i on his reforms in the sector.&ldquo;Matiang&rsquo;i should tell Kenyans if he is a quality assurance officer or a minister because his actions are too dangerous for the nation,&rdquo; he said.He termed the Cabinet Secretary a conman who cooked the 2016 KCPE and KCSE results, and reiterated that a forensic audit was necessary.Read: Knut demands forensic audit of 2016 KCSE resultsAlso read: I am not part of cartel, Sossion says after Matiang'i dismisses 'prophets of doom'Sossion said Kiswahili Insha, English Composition and Agriculture practical results were left out in the grading.&ldquo;How can a student score 90 per cent in an Agriculture practical and get an overall result of an E?" he asked.The fiery union boss also faulted Matiang'i for calling Knut officials the "prophets of doom&rdquo; for criticising the results.The CS had insisted that such criticism will not stop him from leveling the playground for all learners.
