Kitui Governor Julius Malombe has said giving guns to locals will escalate the clashes in Ukasi, Mwingi Central. Speaking to journalists in Mwingi yesterday, Malombe said the guns should be given to trained youths. “My stand is clear and simple. Killings in Mwingi will not be ended by giving guns to untrained youths. They should be trained and employed permanently in the GSU contingent, so that they can patrol the border areas since they are well conversant with the area,” Malombe said. He said the county is ready to work with the national government and move the Ukasi police post and barrier to Katumba, 35km from Ukasi. “Those encroaching our county know Katumba is the border of Kitui and Tana River counties. They are just pretending,” Malombe said. “Just look at places such as Turkana, where locals have been armed. There is no peace at all because they keep on fighting. Personally, I think dialogue is the only option which will help us end these clashes. But again, all those criminals walking around with guns should be disarmed. We don’t want anymore bloodshed,” the governor ssaid. Nkaiserry said more 120 NPRs will be deployed to the border areas.
