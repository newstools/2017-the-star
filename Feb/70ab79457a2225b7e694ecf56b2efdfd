Directors of the collapsed Imperial Bank Ltd have said there are no financial records to show how the Sh42 billion being claimed from them was reached at. In defence papers, Alnashir Popat, Anwar Hajee, Jinit Shah, Hanif Mohamed, Mukesh Kumar Patel, Vishnu Dhutia, Eric Gitonga, Omurembe Iyadi and Christopher Diaz say the figure is far too high and no particulars have been provided to validate it.They said since the appointment of the receiver, they have been unable to verify the exact amount of money defrauded from the bank.They said the bank and the CBK have denied them access to any of the records or financial statements.The directors have also denied admitting to the loss of Sh38 billion at the bank as alleged. The figure, they say was identified by FTI in their preliminary report of 12 October last year to the board, as having been fraudulently disbursed from the bank.&ldquo;If the bank has lost Sh42 billion as alleged, the bank and CBK are liable for the loss by reason of being contributory negligent in the running of the bank affairs,&rdquo; they say.The directors say there is no evidence they caused the loss of the claimed funds.They have also denied permitting or facilitating the operation or fraudulent operation of WE Tilley Ltd and its associated companies, Adra International Ltd, Metro Petroleum Ltd and Jade Petroleum Ltd and that gave rise to various financial exposures as alleged.The court documents have so far linked these companies to a relative of Yagnesh Devani and a relative of Ketan Somaia.Jade Petroleum, owned by Raj Devani, Metro Petroleum, owned by Pankaj Somaia and Adra International is allied to former general managing director Abdulmalek Jamohamed.It is said the Abdulamalek, now deceased, used to pay them off [Somaia and Devani], through Jade, Adra and Metro Petroleum.The directors have maintained they were not expressly aware of the fraudulent schemes at the bank. They also denied having acquired any assets using money that was fraudulently or unlawfully obtained from the bank.&ldquo;The persons who participated in the fraud at the bank are known to Imperial Bank and they include Former GMD, Naeem Shah, James Kaburu and officials at the CBK,&rdquo; they state.In the case, the CBK sued the directors of the troubled Imperial Bank, seeking to freeze assets worth Sh42 billion, held in more than 40 companies.It also sought an order to compel the bank directors and shareholders to pay back Sh2.7 billion, allegedly given to them fraudulently in dividends.The CBK, Imperial Bank and the Kenya Deposit Insurance Corporation decided to go after the directors on grounds they engaged in fraud.The case will be mentioned on March 17.
