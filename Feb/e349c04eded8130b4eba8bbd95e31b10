Doctors are sorry for deaths caused by their strike but will not back down until their 2013 CBA with the government is implemented.KMA Coast secretary general Abifan Mwachi said doctors will only return to work if the Collective Bargaining Agreement is fully implemented."There are no two ways; the government must implement it. It is about reclaiming the profession," he said on Wednesday."It is the constitutional right for Kenyans to receive the highest level of healthcare. However, that does not call for the enslaving of doctors who have the right to do any other work for their sustenance."He spoke at KMA Hall in Pandya Hospital where more than 1,000 private, public and freelance doctors converged to chart way forward.This was after the Court of Appeal released seven union officials who had been jailed on Monday for failing to call of the strike that has lasted more than 73 days.Judges Wanjiru Karanja, Hannah Okwengu and Jamilla Mohamed said negotiations will take place over seven days and that they will return to court on February 23.[VIDEO] Doctors' union officials jailed one month for contempt of courtMwachi welcomed the release of the KMPDU officials who had been sentenced to a month in jail saying this boosted their fight."No army will want to go to the battle front with its general wounded. To some extent, injuries have already been suffered. To the perpetrators of that, we shall forgive and will forever remember your name."More on this: Shaved prisoner Oluga receives guests as doctors' jail term beginsMwachi also asked private hospitals to remain in solidarity with their public counterparts to ensure negotiations with the government reach a favourable deal.The secretary general dared the government to hire doctors from Cuba, Hungary and Switzerland who are ready to agree to the current terms of service.He also said Health CS Cleopa Mailu and PS Nicholas Muraguri are incompetent and should be given lighter duties.Read: Nairobi Hospital closes for 48hrs in solidarity with jailed KMPDU officialsHealth workers in Kwale county also downed their tools to demand service allowances of Sh15,000 to Sh20,000.They said laboratory technologists, dental, nutritionists, biological engineers and counsellors were facing discrimination over allowances.Other who went on strike were pharmaceutical, physiotherapy and health records personnel.Carrying placards and branches, the workers marched from Kwale Baraza Park to Governor Salim Mvurya's office to demand the pay."Even after a document authorising this has not been implemented three weeks later. The county should ensure our money is been given to us," said clinical officer Saidi Ndaro.Ndaro added that the health professionals should be paid the allowances, just like nurses.The government last year agreed to pay nursing allowances of Sh20,000 for group G-L and Sh15,000 for group M, which was effected from January 2017."We will not go to work until we are given our allowances because nurses and doctors cannot manage hospitals in isolation," said Ndaro.The health workers were later addressed by county Health official Athman Chiguzo after a short meeting with other county officials on behalf of Mvurya who was not around.Chiguzo assured them that their issues were being looked into."Once the issue is solved through the SRC, you will get allowances backdated from January this year just like nurses," he said.&rdquo;There is no disagreement anywhere because I have the budget for your allowances. We are just waiting for SRC approval."Noting he is the paymaster, he said he will ensure processes are followed and the payments made.Kwale county public service board chair Kassim Riga said the Council of Governors and the Salaries and Remuneration Commission will have discussed the matter by next week.The health workers agreed to wait for two weeks for their allowances to be paid but said they will take to the streets if this is not done.Read: Raila happy with Court of Appeal ruling, says Jubilee humiliating doctors
