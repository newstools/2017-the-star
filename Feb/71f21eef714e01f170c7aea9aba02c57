He clinched gold in the APB-WSB Olympic qualifiers in Vargas, Venezuela, without throwing a single punch when his Dominican opponent, Hector Luis Garcia, failed to climb the ring.Gicharu was thus handed a walkover.Garcia could have suffered an injury during the semi-finals that made it impossible for him to fight the previous day.
