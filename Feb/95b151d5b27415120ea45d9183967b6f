A police officer has told a Kibera court he witnessed Mwingi Central MP Joe Mutambu assault Helicopter Ministry Bishop Thomas Wahome.Corporal Polycarp Magai on Thursday testified in a case in which Mutambu has been charged with assaulting the cleric and stealing a Sh3.3 million vehicle.ON July 11 last year, Mutambu denied the charge before principal magistrate Bernard Ochoi and was released on Sh300,000 bail.Magai said on September 21, 2015, he had been directed by the Kilimani DCIO to accompany Wahome to the legislator&rsquo;s office on Muchai Drive in Kilimani, Nairobi, to repossess his vehicle, which he claimed the MP had refused to return.Magai said he saw the MP slap Wahome on his right cheek so hard. He and others restrained him from assaulting Wahome further.Wahome went to hospital and later filled a P3 form. The prosecution made an application for the court to direct the MP to take the vehicle to the police station because it is an exhibit. They said it should be in the hands of the investigating officer and not the accused.Through his lawyer, Mutambu said he is ready to bring the lorry before the court so it can see it is not valued as high as the police had claimed.He said he paid Wahome some money for the lorry.Ochoi ordered that the vehicle be towed to the Kilimani police station and kept in the custody of the investigator.Wahome, in court documents, says he lent his lorry to the MP so he could use it to ferry building materials, but he refused to return it. But Mutambu denies this, saying he paid Sh50,000 as down payment for the purchase of the lorry.The hearing continues on April 19.In March last year, Wahome said the MP assaulted him in the presence of police officers, who had gone to arrest the legislator. He said he was a good friend of Mutambu and that is why he agreed to give him his lorry, which is now the reason for their fallout. Wahome said he tried to follow up the matter, but every time the MP gave him one excuse after another. He said the MP on many occasions gave him Sh50,000 as a gift to his church. He said someone later told him Mutambu was repainting his lorry.
