Some Mt Elgon constituency leaders and elders opposed to Bungoma Deputy Governor Hillary Chongwony have threatened to endorse a new running mate for Governor Kenneth Lusaka.They accuse Chongwony of not delivering development for the region, which has lagged behind for many years since independence.Lusaka snubbed a meeting with Sabaot elders to discuss Chongwony's conduct.The elders from Kaptama, Kapsokwony, Kopsiro and Cheptais wards had gone to see Lusaka at Webuye.They were to discuss who should be his running mate.Led by Stephen Musani and Rofas Siyoi, the elders accused Lusaka of disappointing them."We had an appointment with the governor, who had agreed to meet us, but he left in a hurry despite the fact that he knew we were around. He told our representative he had another function," Musani said . The elders and some opinion leaders said they will not let Chongwony to continue holding such a plum position, yet he has neglected the community.Siyoi, a former chairman of the defunct Mt Elgon County Council, said they want another meeting with the governor to discuss "serious and sensitive political matters" that affect Mt Elgon constituency.He said Chongwony has not assisted his community since he became deputy governor in 2013.But Chongwony said he is not aware of plans to replace him, saying he has helped his community by setting up many projects."Those are just a handful of brokers hungry for handouts. There is nothing tangible they could have come to discuss with the governor," he said.Lusaka told the Star on the phone he didn't snub the elders."I can't do that. I respect elders very much. It is only that I had a busy schedule but I will still arrange to meet them. They are important stakeholders in this county," he said.
