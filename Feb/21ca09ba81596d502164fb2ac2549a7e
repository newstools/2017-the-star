Residents of Samburu have demonstrated against Cord leader Raila Odinga for criticising local leaders, accusing them of misuse of public funds when he toured the county last week.The opposition leader lashed out at leaders in the region for using devolution funds meant for development to acquire private property in the county and in Nairobi, saying what they have acquired can&rsquo;t be matched with what they earn. The protesters said they are in the Jubilee Party, supporting the reelection of President Uhuru Kenyatta in August, because they have seen the benefits of &ldquo;being in government&rdquo;. Among the benefits they mentioned were the appointment of Agriculture PS Richard Lesiyampe, the nomination of Naisula Lesuuda and the construction of a 10km probase tarmac road in Maralal town.Ann Lenturkan, one of the protesters, urged Raila to &ldquo;campaign in the right manner&rdquo; instead of attacking their leaders while seeking votes from the Samburu region.Joyce Lesilampa, another resident, said Samburu leaders are not thieves as they were portrayed by the opposition leader.
