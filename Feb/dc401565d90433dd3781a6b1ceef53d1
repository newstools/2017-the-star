The Health department in Lamu has raised concern over the rising number of sick children being brought into the county from neighbouring Somalia.County health director David Mulewa said the children's immunisation record is unknown.They are being treated in Kiunga and Ishakani.Speaking in his office on Tuesday, Mulewa said this could lead to an outbreak of infectious illnesses.He said the county has launched a monthly immunisation programme for children in Kiunga and Ishakani.Mulewa said the county, in collaboration with the US marine unit, KDF and the Safari Doctors have been offering health services to children in cKiunga, Ishakani and Basuba.He said the county will launch a massive immunisation campaign this month.&ldquo;We are doing all this in order to protect the children from any illnesses that might be spread by those from Somalia. As long as we don&rsquo;t know the immunization history of children coming from Somalia, we are better off immunising our own just to be safe,&rdquo; said Mulewa.
