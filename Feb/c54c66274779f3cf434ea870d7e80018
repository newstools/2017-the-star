Youths who allow themselves to be used by politicians during campaigns should be prosecuted, Kigumo MP Jamleck Kamau has said."Every Kenyan has a right to visit the county and leaders have a right to look for votes anywhere in Kenya. No leader should use young people to heckle rivals. It's up to us to desist from being deceived for small pay to cause unrest for Kenyans," he said."I have in past events seen youths trying to disrupt my meetings with Muranga residents and it is sad that they end up confessing they are pushed to do this because of money. This is why we are working towards lifting Muranga to ensure they are empowered to desist from such vices,"Kamau spoke in Kiharu on Sunday. "Parents should tell their children to only listen to politicians who engage in issue-based politics, not selfish individuals who conduct smear campaigns," he said.
