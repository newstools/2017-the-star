Cricket Kenya selectors have surprisingly named seam bowler Elijah Otieno to the national squad for the upcoming ICC World Cricket League Championship match against Nepal&shy;, in a selection that once again ignored the performance in the NPCA league.Once again, the selectors opted for &lsquo;available&rsquo; player instead of basing the selection on form and performance in the current league. The squad is set to leave the country this afternoon for a series of build-up matches in Baroda, India.Otieno was left out of the Hong Kong series in November in Nairobi after the selectors felt he had not done well in the Nairobi Provincial Cricket Association (NPCA) Super League. But with only NPCA Twenty20 being the only competition the Swamibapa bowler has featured in for the last two months amid dismal performance, the selectors still recalled him back to the team.Otieno replaces Eugene Maneno, who was selected for the Hong Kong series but was never fielded. They also handed Kanbis spinner Pushpak Kerai his national team debut and he will now replaces his team-mate Narendra Patel, who is unavailable for the tour.The Kanbis all-rounder has on several occasions failed to avail himself for tours despite being one of the top players in the team. Kerai had a good season in 2015 and disastrous one last year, where he only picked six wickets for the entire season.He was, however, selected to the Kenya &lsquo;A&rsquo; tour of Uganda in November but on his return, little has been heard of him in terms of performance.Youthful Rushabh Vadrhan Patel, who has also failed to sparkle with the bat for a while, has also been handed a place in the team alongside Nairobi Gymkhana&rsquo;s skipper Karan Kaul. However, Kaul has on most occasions carried his club single handed in the ongoing NPCA Twenty20 with a couple of good knocks.Former skipper Maurice Ouma, who has been enjoying good form for almost a year, was once again ignored.While in India, the team will play Baroda Select sides before departing to Nepal on March 9 for the two ICC WCLC matches on March 11 and 13.Meanwhile Nepal&rsquo;s national cricket team skipper Paras Khadka, who suffered from intestinal obstruction due to recurrent appendicitis, has been discharged from the hospital, where he underwent surgery.Khadka was admitted to the hospital after he suffered severe abdominal pains. It&rsquo;s not clear if he will be fit to play against Kenya.Squad: Rakep Patel, Nelson Odhiambo, Dhiren Gondaria, Pushpak Kerai (Kanbis), Shem Obado, Collins Obuya (Stray Lions), Nehemiah Odhiambo, Alex Obanda, (Swamibapa), Karan Kaul, Lucas Oluoch, RushabhVadrhan Patel (Gymkhana), Elijah Otieno (Swamibapa), Gurdeep Singh (Nairobi Sikh Union) and Irfan Karim (unattached).
