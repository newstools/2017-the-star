Elijah Rotich, a commercial farmer from Elgeyo Marakwet County, is the latest millionaire in town after winning the 133rd Lotto this week. Rotich became the lottery&rsquo;s 122nd overall millionaire and the 9th in 2017 after winning Sh1.2m, barely a month after starting to play. The 39-year-old was hopeful of winning but he didn&rsquo;t expect it to happen so soon.&ldquo;I am delighted with the win and I know It will change my life for the better. I thought it would take long for me to win considering I am too &lsquo;young&rsquo; in the competitionSo when I got the call confirming that I was the winner, I could not believe it,&rdquo; an elated Rotich offered. &ldquo;With the winnings, I will rebuild my home and make savings to ensure my daughters&rsquo; and son&rsquo;s education is catered for without hitches. I also have a plan to venture into cattle farming while my wife, Naomi takes care of the horticulture element of our farming,&rdquo; he intimated.
