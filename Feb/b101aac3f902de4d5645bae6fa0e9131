Global investment and advisory firm Intellecap will next week host a two-day entrepreneurship and innovation forum on promoting off-grid lighting investments in Africa, the firm announced. Sankalp Africa Summit, in its fourth edition, will from February 23 bring together global investors, development financiers and charitable organisations. The meeting will largely focus on options for funding start-ups in solar energy. The organizers said off-grid lighting and electrification sector has not scaled up and is yet to realise its full potential in terms of reach and impact for lack of funds. Continued growth requires access to new and major financiers for the evolving pioneers, and expansion of existing sources of funding to replicate the earlier successes, they said. Intellicap said it has partnered with Global Off-Grid Lighting Association to help the industry and investors address investment barriers.international
