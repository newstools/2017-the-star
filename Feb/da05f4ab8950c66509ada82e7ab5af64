A group of mechanics in Naivasha yesterday took to the streets to mobilise their colleagues to register as voters. Group leader Mwangi Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a said the majority of the young mechanics had not registered. He said they will ensure all potential voters from the Jua Kali industry have registered with the IEBC.
