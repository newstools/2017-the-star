Jubilee Party has denied allegations that there are aspirants who have been issued with direct Party nomination certificates.The Party on Saturday stated that no candidate for any elective seat will be handed a certificate on a silver platter.Head of Secretariat Raphael Tuju warned against some aspirants who are using the allegations to scare away their competitors ahead of Party primaries in April."It has come to our attention that some dishonest aspirants are peddling falsehoods that they are already in possession of nomination certificates from the Party. We wish to make it categorically clear that the Jubilee Party has not issued any such certificate to anyone," Tuju said in a statement.Read: Party primaries slotted for April as IEBC reviews timelines ahead of pollsTuju said some aspirants have been claiming that they are close to President Uhuru Kenyatta and his Deputy thus duping others that they can secure them with certificates at a small fee."That again is a pure lie and those doing that are just political con-men. It is inconceivable that some aspirants are using such tactics to scare away potential competitors," Tuju stated."The Party leader and his Deputy made it very clear in a statement during the NEC meeting on 21st February that they have no preferred candidates and will abide by the choices made by party members."
