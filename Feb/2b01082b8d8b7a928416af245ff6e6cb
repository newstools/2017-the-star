Deputy President William Ruto has dismissed claims by the opposition that the national government has overlooked the Kamba community.He spoke at Mtito Andei yesterday during a voter listing campaign tour in Makueni county.The DP cited the standard gauge railway, Thwake Dam and the Kibwezi-Kitui road as some of the major projects initiated by Jubilee administration in Ukambani.Ruto said there are several people from the region serving in senior positions in government.He cited Kenya Medical Training College chairman Philip Kaloki and Sports Kenya chairman Fred Muteti, who accompanied him."Those saying the Jubilee administration has sidelined you are not being honest. Everyone can see how the SGR has changed the face of Makueni," Ruto said.He criticised Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka, saying he has not done much to help the Kamba community despite being in government for more than 30 years."What we have done in three years is what NASA leaders have failed to do in the many years they have been in government," the DP said.He urged the Kamba community to vote for Jubilee, saying the opposition has nothing to offer."If the opposition has been unable agree on a presidential candidate, how will they agree on what to do with the lives of 40 million Kenyans?&rdquo; Ruto said. He was with Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko, MPs Rachael Nyamai (Kitui South), Victor Munyaka (Machakos Town), Regina Ndambuki (Kilome), Naomi Shaban (Taveta), former Kaiti MP Gideon Ndambuki and Makueni speaker Stephen Ngelu.Ruto said the government will provide 10,000 bags of relief food to the hunger-striken residents.He said, however, the relief food is a short-term solution. Ruto said the government is committed to constructing Thwake dam for farmers to grow food crops. Sonko urged Kalonzo to ditch the opposition for Jubilee.He said he is confident the Jubilee administration will win the August polls.Sonko dismissed claims that Jubilee is divided in Ukambani."Those saying Ukambani is an opposition zone are misleading the public. Jubilee is strong and that is why we have MPs from Ukambani with us today," he said.
