Fishermen in Lake Naivasha have started to feel the effects of the ongoing drought, with fish production falling by more than 30 per cent. The slump has been attributed to the drop in water levels around the water body in the last one month, with fears that production could decline further in the coming days. The price of fish has nearly doubled as demand shoots up. Lake Naivasha Boat Owners Association chairman David Kilo said the population of tilapia and common carp species has dropped. He said it is the norm for fish production to drop whenever water levels reduce. Kilo said this could change with the coming of rains. &ldquo;We have seen a drop in fish production by 30 per cent, but we hope this will change as short rains start pounding the catchment area,&rdquo; he said. Kilo said the production has been worsened by water hyacinth, which is on the rise mainly along North and South Lake.
