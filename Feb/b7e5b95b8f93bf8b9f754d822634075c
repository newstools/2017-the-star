The government yesterday started distributing three million bags of subsidised fertiliser to farmers across the country.National Cereals and Produce Board managing director Newton Terer said the fertiliser, mainly DAP, will be sold to farmers for Sh1,800 per 50-kilogramme bag.He said this is cheaper than the Sh3,200 offered by private traders. Top-dressing fertiliser, mainly NPK and CAN, will be sold at Sh1,500 per bag, he added.&ldquo;Two million bags will be used for planting, while one million bags will be used for top dressing. Coffee and rice farmers in Central Kenya will also benefit,&rdquo; Terer said on the phone.Agriculture Principal Secretary Richard Lesiyampe last week said the government has bought 150,000 metric tonnes of fertiliser in anticipation of the long-rain season.&ldquo;The National Cereals and Produce Board has started distribution to more than 1.5 million coffee, maize and rice farmers in the Nyanza, Western, South Rift and Central regions,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;This comes ahead of the start of the long-rain season expected mid-next month and in early April.&rdquo;Terer said farmers will be vetted by local committees sanctioned by the county governments and Agriculture departments to qualify.They will be required to present an approved form to NCPB depot officials, he said.In the last two years, there have been cases of loss of fertiliser from the NCPB stores. Such fertiliser finds its way into the market and is sold to farmers at higher prices than what the NCPB offers.Lesiyampe said the government has started an induction programme targeting all NCPB officers manning the stores to ensure they understand the new distribution system.&ldquo;We have retrained NCPB officers managing the depots to ensure they understand the government aspirations on extension of the subsidised fertiliser to small-scale farmers,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Adulterating fertiliser is an act of economic sabotage. It impacts negatively on food security. This year, the government is cautious to ensure farmers are not shortchanged.&rdquo;Farmers countrywide use 12 million bags of fertiliser. Out of this, the government provides between 25 per cent and 30 per cent, while the private sector supplies the shortfall.
