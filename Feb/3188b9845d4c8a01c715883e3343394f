The governors are opposed the plans by the Ministry of Health to hire 400 nurses and clinical officers to run 100 container clinics. Health PS Nicholas Muraguri met representatives of the Council of Governors at Afya House yesterday morning to discuss the plan. However, the ministry is expected to go ahead with the hiring because the finances have come through the World Bank. The Public Service Commission backs the plan to hire the 400 workers on two-year contracts. &ldquo;While granting the approval, the PSC directed that the recruitment be handled strictly in accordance with your participation,&rdquo; Muraguri told CoG chairman Peter Munya in a letter. The health workers, mostly nurses, will man the 100 container clinics that the ministry imported last year. They were kept in the National Youth Service grounds in Mariakani, Mombasa. Last year, the governors successfully stopped plans by the ministry to hire nurses to work in public hospitals. The governors argued health was a devolved function and the ministry has no authority to employ health workers then send them to county-run facilities. If the current plans go ahead, the nurses who volunteered to fight Ebola in West Africa will be given first priority. Of the 170 health workers who travelled to Sierra Leone and Liberia in January last year, about 70 nurses remain jobless. The volunteers &mdash; including nurses, doctors and laboratory technicians &mdash; were paid between Sh270,000 and Sh450,000 monthly during their six-month stay in West Africa. Health CS Cleopa Mailu had promised the nurses they would be the first to be hired. &ldquo;We are proud of you for representing our nation during the Ebola outbreak in Liberia and Sierra Leone. Should opportunities arise, we will accord you preference,&rdquo; he said last year. The the first 20 container clinics will be opened in Nairobi slums.
