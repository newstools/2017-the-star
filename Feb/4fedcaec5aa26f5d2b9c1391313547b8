The MP, a well known top Jubilee operative, could not believe his eyes on Tuesday when Interior Cabinet Secretary Joseph Nkaissery locked him out of a security meeting at Harambee House attended by securocrats and elected leaders from the troubled region. The MP, who had not be invited to the meeting, attempted to gatecrash it, but was rebuked by Nkaissery as he opened the door.
