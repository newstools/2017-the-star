Former Devolution CS Anne Waiguru has been barred by court from making comments in the media regarding the NYS scandal.Milimani principal magistrate David Mburu yesterday ordered Waiguru not to utter or cause to be published any comments relating to the theft at the Devolution ministry, which she headed until she resigned, pending hearing and determination of a defamation suit filed against her by Paul Kinuthia.&ldquo;The issue of the NYS is no doubt a matter of great public interest and citizens such as Waiguru have a right to make fair comment. The right, however, does not extend to discussions on matters which are pending before the court,&rdquo; Mburu said. Kinuthia is among 11 suspects, including businesswoman Josephine Kabura, Ben Gethi and lawyer Patrick Ogola, facing money laundering charges. He accused Waiguru of using the case to gain political mileage.Kinuthia filed the suit in September last year, saying Waiguru had on several occasions injured his reputation and character while debating the NYS scandal on TV.The businessman told the court Waiguru made statements which could be taken to mean he is guilty, allegations that caused his business to suffer losses.Waiguru had not opposed the application, saying she does not know Kinuthia nor has she ever met him in person or through an intermediary and would, therefore, not have any reason to defame him.She told the magistrate the businessman should not blame her for his woes and that her comments were fair, considering that the case is of great public interest. But Mburu was of the view that discussing a matter that is pending before court is prejudicial. The magistrate said an accused person by law is presumed innocent until proven guilty.
