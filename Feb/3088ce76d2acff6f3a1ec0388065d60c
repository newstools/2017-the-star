Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology has won an international competitive bid to host the regional Maritime Technology Cooperation Centre for Africa. The university will lead an ambitious global project funded by the European Union through the International Maritime Organisation, aimed at mitigating harmful effects of climate change. The IMO says JKUAT will host the MTCC-Africa in collaboration with the Kenya Ports Authority and Kenya Maritime Authority. Similar programmes are being rolled out in Asia through China&rsquo;s Shanghai Maritime University, and in Caribbean through the University of Trinidad and Tobago. The MTCCs will receive allocations from the &euro;10 million (Sh1.1 billion) European Union funding for the project. They will be established and resourced to become regional centres of excellence, providing leadership in promoting ship energy-efficiency technologies and operations, and the reduction of harmful emissions from ships,&rdquo; IMO said.
