A Wiper MP has criticised party leader Kalonzo Musyoka for trying to woo Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana to the party.Makueni MP Daniel Maanzo on Saturday said it is wrong for the Wiper leader to force leaders to fold their parties. &ldquo;Every leader is entitled to a party of his choice according to the Constitution. No one should be forced to join another party,&rdquo; he told reporters in Muthyoi village, Nzaui subcounty. Maanzo criticised the manner in which Kibwana was handled by Wiper leaders at Wote town last week. The governor was heckled by Wiper supporters after he declined Musyoka&rsquo;s call to fold up his Muungano Party and join Wiper.Musyoka, who was accompanied by deputy party leader Farah Maalim, vice chairman Senator Mutula Kilonzo Junior and MPs Jesica Mbalu (Kibwezi East) and Maanzo, had toured Makueni during a voter listing campaign. &ldquo;Ideological differences or party affiliations should not be used to deny leaders audience,&rdquo; Maanzo said.
