Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga has urged the opposition to stick together to defeat Jubilee in the first round of the election. He said the agreement between Raila Odinga, Musalia Mudavadi, Kalonzo Musyoka and Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula will be a key factor in kicking out Jubilee.Rasanga said no party leader will make it to State House without the help of others, as politics is a game of numbers.&ldquo;I understand the pressure each party leader is receiving from his supporters not to accept anything short of being the presidential candidate,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I want to inform them that Kenya can only be ruled by one President at a time, hence, the need to support one of their own.&rdquo; He addressed journalists on Tuesday at Ramula in Gem. Rasanga urged Kalonzo not to walk out of NASA. &ldquo;I know the Jubilee Party has sensed danger with the formation of NASA and now their key agenda is to divide the opposition by luring members with non-existent goodies,&rdquo; the governor said.
