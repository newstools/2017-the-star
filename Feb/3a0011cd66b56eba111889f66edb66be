Proceedings of the powerful and influential National Assembly Public Accounts Committee nearly turned into a fist-fight on Thursday last week in an unseemly row over the NYS report.Reports indicate that more than Sh1.8 billion was lost at the National Youth Service in fraudulent pay and inflated invoices.An embarrassing altercation between some members almost turned the session chaotic.The ugly drama, just the latest in a string of controversies rocking the 29-member House panel, threw into disarray the adoption of the committee&rsquo;s delayed report on the NYS saga.Members argued over whether to recommend influential people mentioned in the report to be barred from holding public office and be surcharged to recover the stolen money.Finger-pointing, table bangingMembers differed sharply three times as they sought to adopt their own report, sparking ferocious exchanges among themselves at the Committee Room 9 at Parliament Buildings.They engaged in vicious exchanges punctuated by finger-pointing, table-banging and trading barbs.The MPs retreated to Mombasa three weeks ago for a bonding session to harmonise the draft report, but flew back to Nairobi without a common position.The Mombasa meeting was also marred by temper flare-ups and tantrums after members opposed the draft report on claims that it had been watered down and &lsquo;gravely mutilated&rsquo;.The committee has for the last two weeks convened three more meetings, including last Thursday&rsquo;s, in frantic efforts to build consensus, adopt the report and then table it for debate.There are claims that some people want the tabling of the report delayed, preventing its debate in the House and balancing political interests.Member Junet Mohamed&rsquo;s two companies &ndash; Zeigham Enterprises Ltd and Faraza Ltd &ndash; won contracts with NYS amounting to Sh129 million.The House will also experience quorum hitches in the coming weeks as MPs shift focus on political parties primaries expected in April.Demand for accurate reportIn last Thursday&rsquo;s meeting, trouble is said to have started when a member said that the draft recommendations were erroneously written without considering the committee&rsquo;s findings.Usually, the findings from evidence submitted by witnesses during hearings are cross-examined for factuality to inform the recommendations.Kitutu Masaba MP Timothy Bosire and Nambale MP Sakwa Bunyasi reportedly demand that the work be above reproach given the huge expectations from citizens, who have been following the sessions aired live on TV.&ldquo;The issues being raised were valid. It is true that the committee&rsquo;s report has been drafted in a vague manner to conceal the truth and making sure that the culprits walk away scot-free,&rdquo; a member of PAC said.Yesterday, Bosire declined to comment on the closed-door session, but said the panel has not disagreed fundamentally. &ldquo;We hope to conclude the report by Thursday this week,&rdquo; the ODM national Treasurer said.Powerful state officers involvedA senior member of the panel said there are shocking revelations on how senior Jubilee administration officials used proxy and shadowy companies to milk billions of shillings from NYS.They are said to have connived with junior and senior NYS staff to inflate invoices, make double payments and approve non-existent deliveries.Several companied owned by key suspect Josephine Kabura were paid more than Sh1.6 billion, in what NYS officials admitted were double and inflated entries in the Ifmis system.In a bid to unravel the &lsquo;puppeteers&rsquo; of the NYS scandal, the committee has also found out that officers at the NYS were taking parallel instructions from political figures in government. This ensured they sidestepped protocol.A PAC member said the stand-off in the committee is a scheme by some powerful people in government and in the committee to protect suspects.The powerful watchdog panel is said to have differed over recommendations on former Devolution CS Anne Waiguru, Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen and Farouk Kibet, an aide of DP William Ruto.The committee found out that Murkomen&rsquo;s law firm was a beneficiary of Sh15 million proceeds from NYS disguised as legal fees, but differences have delayed adoption of a recommendation to surcharge the senator.Ben Gethi, the alleged mastermind of the NYS scandal, is said to have told the committee that he was a hatchet man for an influential member of the Kenyatta family whose details some forces want protected.Gethi&rsquo;s company Horizon Enterprises, which the committee says is owned by a key figure in the Kenyatta family, supplied oil and lubricants, while his firm Lateco Technologies supplied food to NYS.The committee projects that NYS would have lost up to Sh16 billion in fraudulent transactions at a time when the budget was enhanced to Sh25 billionA faction of the committee wants Waiguru left off the hook because as CS, her role in the management of funds at NYS were limited to policy direction and general supervision and not direct administration.However, some members claim that during the era of massive looting at the NYS, the Cabinet had been given expanded mandate to be accounting officers and also take charge of the human resource functions in their ministries.&ldquo;The role of Cabinet Secretaries has been widened. They now have greater oversight in sanctioning procurement in ministry departments and agencies, formerly a preserve of principal secretaries. They will now also approve work, procurement and cash flow plans,&rdquo; reads a press dispatch from State House on December 2, 2014.PAC has also been battling claims that its members were compromised by a local commercial bank to a tune of Sh40 million to dilute the NYS report.
