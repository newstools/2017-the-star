Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong yesterday urged doctors to &ldquo;swallow their pride&rdquo; and open a dialogue to end their 66-day strike.He said the talks being led by Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli will resolve the more than two months strike. &ldquo;Remaining defiant will not solve the stalemate. Doctors should swallow their pride and come to the negotiating table so that they can help suffering Kenyans,&rdquo; Ojaamong said in Busia.He said the CBA the health workers signed in 2013 had &ldquo;glaring anomalies&rdquo;. &ldquo;The signatory to the agreement was not the Health Cabinet Secretary. The CBA does not recognise county governments,&rdquo; Ojaamong said.The governor said Atwoli is spot-on in seeking an amicable solution, since it is an industrial matter, which can be handled through negotiation.Ojaamong also dismissed critics who say health should not have been devolved.&ldquo;The department had virtually collapsed when it was devolved in 2013, but within four years the scenario has drastically changed,&rdquo; he said.He said the national government&rsquo;s system that gave doctors a lot of freedom continues to hurt county health services.&ldquo;Imagine, out of 35 doctors in Busia, 17 are on study leave of four and five years. But they continue drawing full salaries, having rendered no services,&rdquo; Ojaamong saidThis comes two weeks after Busia MCAs questioned senior officers over Sh11 million health equipment.The equipment was acquired one and a half years ago. The equipment was taken to Busia County Referral Hospital.Chief of staff and governor&rsquo;s private secretary Robert Papa and chief officer Ezekiel Okwach were told to explain whether the equipment from the US was donated or purchased.
