Public primary and secondary schools have not received first term free learning funds, a month after opening.Knut secretary general Wilson Sossion (pictured) has written to Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang&rsquo;i, saying the delay is hurting school operations because head teachers cannot provide services to students. The letter is dated February 1.Sossion has demanded that Matiang&rsquo;i disburse the funds in full to all schools within seven days. &ldquo;Critical school programmes are grinding to a halt,&rdquo; he said.It is difficult to procure tuition supplies and finance first term activities, such as drama festivals, and ball games as your ministry continues to withhold the funds, he said.Sossion argues that it is the sole responsibility of the CS to ensure execution of government commitments and pronouncement within the ministry, including prompt and timely disbursement of free primary and free secondary education funds.The government has in the past committed to releasing the money on time in a 50, 30 and 20 ratio. This has not been fulfilled. Head teachers had been promised that the cash would start trickling to schools&rsquo; bank accounts from Monday. Each primary school pupil receives Sh1,420 per year, while secondary school students get Sh12,860 each year for tuition.Schools are being hurt by the delay, even as the government ensures improper extra levies are not charged. Matiang&rsquo;i has said day secondary school fees should be Sh9,374 and Sh53,553 for boarding schools.
