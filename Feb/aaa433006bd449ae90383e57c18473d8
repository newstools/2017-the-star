A group of Kipsigis elders have filed a petition at a court in Nakuru against the intended construction of Sh34 billion Itare Dam.The elders on Thursday secured March 2 for the hearing of the case, which is hinged on risks to desertification should the project go on.In the suit, the elders argue that the dam will cause rivers at the Lake Victoria catchment to dry, hence should not be constructed."The dam would result to diversion of water from Lake Victoria catchment to Lake Nakuru water basin," the petition states in part.Read: Kipsigis elders challenge construction of Itare Dam in court "The population in the western side will experience acute water shortage," the elders said, adding that farmers would be affected.President Uhuru Kenyatta, while in Nakuru last week, defended the project saying it will not cause drought as perceived."No foreign government can finance a project which will impact negatively on the lives of the people," Uhuru said.However, the petitioners argue that the project will only be of help to a few populace in Nakuru.They say that the dam, to be funded by the German government, has adverse climate change effects in the long run."Trees, birds, animals, fishes and other aquatic life will be greatly affected when the water is diverted," they said.Bomet, Narok, Kericho, Nyamira, Kisumu and Migori counties - said to be at the greatest risk, are interested parties in the petition."The counties will suffer loses in the agriculture and tourism sectors. This will cause abject poverty in the areas," the petitioners said."Crop and dairy farming will be affected in these counties. The poverty levels of most households will worsen," they cited.They further argue that the public participation process was biased and discriminatory as only those who would benefit from the project participated. "The process exclusively shunned the communities which would suffer the consequences," they claim in the suit.An Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of the project says residents of Nakuru East, Nakuru West, Kuresoi North, Molo and Njoro will benefit.Insisting that they were not involved, the elders questioned the report by Messers H. P Gauff Ingenieure Gmbh &amp; Co. KG-JBG of Germany.The group argues that Rivers Kipchorian, Chemosit, Jamji and Kapsonoi, which flow to Lake Victoria, will be re-directed."Some of these rivers flow to River Sondu which has a hydro-electric power plant. This will be rendered non-operational," they state.The elders argue that the project might end up being a white elephant much as taxpayers will have to service the Sh34 billion loan.The construction of the 140-metre deep dam started in June last year at the Mau Forest water tower - a source of at least 10 rivers.Read: Governors Rutto, Chepkwony oppose construction of Sh30 billion Itare damAlso read: Itare Dam will ruin Masai Mara - Raila
