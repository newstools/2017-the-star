A long-distance truck driver has sued the state for delaying to give him a passport, despite applying for one eight years ago and meeting all the requirements.Mohamed Muhumud Farah says the delay is threatening his only source of livelihood and wants the court to intervene. He says in court documents he paid the required fee. Farah says he was given a file number and vetted twice, after which he was told the Immigration office would inform him of the status of his application. He says since then, he has not got any communication and his efforts to reach Immigration officers have bore no fruit.&ldquo;On different occasions at the Immigration offices, I was told I would be informed of the decision to grant me a passport or not,&rdquo; he says. Farah recently got hired by the Dar Petroleum Operating Company, a job that requires him to go to Congo. However, he cannot enter that country because the temporary permit he holds can only allow him to travel within East Africa. He says the delay has violated his rights to fair administrative action. Farah says he is entitled to a passport. He wants the department compelled to issue him with one.
