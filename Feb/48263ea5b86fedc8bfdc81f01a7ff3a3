We sat quietly waiting. A family of grey crowned cranes emerged from the long grass and walked along the edge of the dam, while feeding on aquatic snacks. It was particularly delightful to see that the chicks were still very small, and the parent cranes both went to considerable effort to feed them delicious little morsels. Then I thought how amazing it is that these tiny golden brown &ldquo;fluff-balls&rdquo; eventually grow much larger and transform into such regal cranes with splendid golden crowns and magnificent markings. We are truly blessed in that the Nairobi National Park has a stable population of these endangered royal cranes, which are rare in many parts of Africa. I have had occasions in previous years when flocks of as many as 50 grey crowned cranes gather together in the park. This social behaviour normally takes place outside of breeding season, and could be an ideal opportunity for single young birds to find a lifemate. The grey crowned crane (balearica regulorum) has two sub species: balearica regulorum gibbericeps in East Africa &mdash; also known as the crested crane in Uganda &mdash; and balearica regulorum regulorum in South Africa, with slightly different markings, mainly on the red part of the face. The rarer black crowned crane is also closely related to the grey crowned crane.Seeing crowned cranes in the wild is always wonderfully rewarding, as their colours are beautiful and they are interesting to watch. They have a varied diet ranging from grass seeds to insects and lizards and small rodent. Grey crowned cranes are now listed as endangered in Africa, but thank God the Park is a safe breeding haven with a healthy population. Let's hope and pray that these royal cranes will always grace the Nairobi National Park.
