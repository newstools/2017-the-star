Parliament has shot down a controversial bill which sought to criminalise ogling and intentional bodily contact in public places, including matatus.The Sexual Offences Bill sponsored by Busia woman representative Florence Mutua also outlawed out of court settlement for sexual offenders.Deputy Speaker Joyce Laboso proposed the question for a second time to enable her give a definite outcome of the voting, which was done through acclamationMutua walked out of the chambers in a huff as she waved the bill to her male colleagues who appeared to have been outraged by the radical provisions in it.Legislators concluded debating the Bill last week where male MPs expressed concerns that if the amendment was passed, punishment would be meted for as little as looking at the opposite sex without their consent.According to the Bill, unwanted contact between body parts with genital organs (breasts or buttocks) of another person, but does not include an act that causes penetration amounts to a sexual offence."When a person is convicted of rape, they should also pay a fine to take care of that person they sexually assaulted, as well as the child born out of the same," the bill says.The Bill was shot down in the Second Reading.The Bill also spells out similar heavy penalties for families who marry off the victim to the offender or prevents police officers from conducting investigations or distorts evidence.During last week's debate, Mutua allayed the fears of her male colleagues, and reassured them that the issues they raised will be deliberated upon at a committee level, before the Bill is brought back to the House.If it had been passed into law, the Bill would have sealed loopholes that sexual offenders, including those that defile children, use to escape justice.
