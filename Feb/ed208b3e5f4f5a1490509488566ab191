Kigumo MP Jamleck Kamau has criticised the Muranga government for failing to utilise the county's agricultural potential to avert food shortage and drought.The MP said the leadership is to blame for the food shortage affecting more than 3,000 people in the area.Areas affected by drought in Murang'a include Ithanga, Kambiti, Kakuzi, Makuyu and Kambirwa."It's unfortunate that Murang'a county supplies water to Nairobi, yet residents do not have enough water for domestic use and irrigation," Kamau said.He spoke in Mathioya on Sunday.Kamau said if elected governor, he will ensure Murang'a people utilise water from its large reserves to improve food production through irrigation."We cannot be a fertile land with most food growing in our areas, but keep losing people and livestock to drought," he said.He asked the Devolution ministry to deliver relief food as promised by President Uhuru Kenyatta during his visit to the county in January.During his manifesto launch for governor's race, the MP promised to increase milk prices in the county from Sh35 to Sh50 in the first 100 days.He said the dairy sector, the platform on which Governor Mwangi Wairia anchored his campaigns on before the 2013 election, is not doing as well as it should.
