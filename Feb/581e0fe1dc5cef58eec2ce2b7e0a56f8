Secondary school principals in Kakamega county have said they will defy the directive by Education CS Fred Matiang&rsquo;i not to charge extra levies.County Kenya Secondary Schools Heads&rsquo; Association chairman Godfrey Owori on Wednesday said schools would operate at a loss.&ldquo;The government must address the inefficiencies in tuition charged to ensure quality is not compromised,&rdquo; he said. Owori spoke during an education meeting at Kakamega High School. The meeting brought together principals and education officials from the county.&ldquo;We are prepared to defy the order, especially because it is school management boards, not the government, that pay teachers hired by the school management boards,&rdquo; Owori said.He said schools have to hire additional teachers because the ones posted by the TSC are not enough. &ldquo;When you tell principals not to charge parents to pay the teachers, where do we get money to pay these staff who ensure teaching goes on?&rdquo; Owori said.The government has banned extra charges and issued fees guidelines. On Tuesday, the Education ministry released Sh22.4 billion to public primary and secondary schools to cater for tuition. Teachers had protested against the delay in releasing funds.Branch TSC chairman Raphael Tarus urged principals to use funds prudently.&ldquo;Holiday tuition and weekend classes are illegal and principals found culpable will be disciplined. The government has issued fees guidelines and schools must prioritise their programmes to ensure they remain within budget,&rdquo; he said.County director of Education Fred Kairu said schools must work within the curriculum based establishments.He said the establishments will help determine if schools are understaffed and guide the posting of teachers to address the shortfall.
