The taxman says it has collected a staggering Sh4.7 billion in taxes from eight major betting firms in the last three years.Kenya Revenue Authority commissioner general John Njiraini yesterday told the Departmental Committee on Labour and Social Welfare the revenue represented corporate taxes paid and payable by sector players for the year ending June 30, 2017.The figures, he said, are based on self-assessment-there may have been a lot of revenue lost due to non-compliance.According to the data he presented before the panel, the KRA raked in Sh120 million for 2014-15 financial year, Sh1.2 billion (2015-16) and Sh3.3 billion for 2016-17) fiscal year.Njiraini said while proposed Betting, Lotteries and Gaming (Amendment) Bill, 2016 will result in increased exchequer revenues, the benefits may be short-lived due to elasticity of demand of the serviceThe bill, sponsored by Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo, proposed enhanced tax regime to ensure the taxman collects more from the lucrative industry.&ldquo;Our experience is that high tax rates ultimately lead to reduced demand... develop an underground economy and promote tax evasion,&rdquo; the commissioner general said.Njiraini was meeting the committee chaired by Matungu MP David Were to present the KRA&rsquo;s views on the controversial bill seeking to enhance taxes for the betting, gaming and lotteries firms.He backed the reintroduction of tax on winnings, saying it will give the KRA access to more useful data that will help monitor other taxes including corporate tax, withholding tax and Pay As You Earn.The KRA boss however objected to the proposed limit on winnings to Sh30 million, saying such a threshold should not be enacted in the main law but through a subsidiary legislation.Njiraini said given that winning is normally based on sale volumes, capping the threshold is unjustified since taxes are collected from both the winner and the operator. Regarding a clause which seeks to restrict players of the sector to only Kenyan citizens, Njiraini said that would be impractical especially for online betting since electronic platforms are open to persons inside and outside the country.&ldquo;Moreover there is no good basis to prevent non-Kenyans from participation as this would negatively impact revenue collection,&rdquo; he said.On increasing betting tax from 7.5 per cent to 15 per cent, Njiraini called for a bench marking on rates in other countries to avert tax arbitrage and transfer of pricing. &ldquo;Excess rates would have the impact of driving the services across borders leading to losses for Kenya,&rdquo; he said citing Rwanda [13 per cent] and Ghana [17.5 per cent] as some of the prevailing rates. Njiraini said the taxman wants a simplified legal regime for ease of tax administration.&ldquo;Complex regimes generally complicates tax administration and encourage evasion,&rdquo; he said.Njiraini said the KRA recommends retention of existing regimes to provide time to understand lessons from implementation.&ldquo;Based on such lessons, proposals for amendment may be made which may include the need to consolidate rates as is the case for South Africa,&rdquo; Njiraini said.Regarding the way forward, the KRA boss asked Parliament to commission a comprehensive study to determine the most appropriate regulatory and tax structure in respect to the industry.&ldquo;&hellip;that will balance between social, revenue collection and investment priorities,&rdquo; he said.
