The IEBC has pledged to address concerns raised by the Opposition on the mass voter registration that will end next Tuesday.The commission, led by new CEO Wafula Chebukati, met members of the National Super Alliance at Orange House on Wednesday.Some of the issues Nasa presented in its dossier were double registration, use of fake IDs and the alleged use of the NYS register to list people as legitimate voters.&ldquo;We also raised the issue of civil servants being empowered using state resources, to facilitate registration of voters in certain areas, yet other areas are restrained,&rdquo; said Opposition leader Raila Odinga.Delayed issuance of ID cards in areas perceived to be opposition strongholds was another issue the ODM and Cord boss said they raised.&ldquo;This is what accounts for the slow registration of voters in some parts of the country yet it is politicians who are blamed,&rdquo; said Raila.Nasa also raised the claim that IEBC staff have been compromised by Jubilee Party. Raila and his team said they want the workers vetted and for the government to provide data on births and deaths.They also want information on the status of Biometric Voter Registration kits given to Burundi.Read: IEBC violated law by donating voter kits to Burundi - Auditor GeneralThe ODM leader reported two cases of double registration following a case by Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka.

We have also met members of the foreign missions, donor communities and ambassadors from Europe, USA and other countries,&rdquo; he said. Chebukati added that the commission has also held discussions with the political parties&rsquo; liaison committee and religious leaders. He said more meetings will be held as need arises.The electoral body has admitted finding 78,752 voters with shared ID numbers in its register, 21,149 bearing the same ID numbers and names.IEBC said the remaining 57,603 were records whose ID numbers did not match those at the National Registration Bureau.Cord has insisted that the double registration of voters has often laid the basis for rigging."We have raised concerns about what we consider irregularities in terms of preparation for elections. We have said so many times that this country cannot afford another flawed electoral process," Raila told the media.
