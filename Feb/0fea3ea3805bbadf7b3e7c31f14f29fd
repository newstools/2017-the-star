National Water Conservation and Pipeline Corporation chairman Julius Kones and Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto have clashed over the construction of the controversial Sh33 billion Itare Dam.Kones accused Rutto of politicising the matter at the expense of water security.During an interview with a local radio station on Tuesday, Rutto opposed the construction, saying there was no public participation. He said there are no &ldquo;scientific facts&rdquo; to convince him the project is safe.Yesterday, Kones said many residents are suffering for lack of water.&ldquo;Let me inform the governor that dams are water storage facilities used to harness and conserve water for use when the need arises and help mitigate floods,&rdquo; he said.Kones said the construction is backed by science. In November last year, Cord leader Raila Odinga opposed the project saying it could destroy the Masai Mara and dip tourism revenues.He said the project would make 12 rivers in eight counties &ndash; including the Mara River &ndash; dry up because water will be diverted from the Mau Forest.But Kones said the project will not block the flow of rivers.He will run against Rutto for the Bomet governor seat.Kones said, &ldquo;All studies and approvals for Itare were granted by the relevant agencies, including the National Environment and Management Authority and Water Resource Management Authority.&rdquo;He said Itare is not the only dam under construction in the South West Mau catchment area. Kones cited the Bosto, Kibusto, Upper Narok, Londiani and Soin Koru dams.Kones faulted Rutto for creating fear among residents that the Itare Dam could collapse and kill people.He said other dams across the country, including the Seven Forks, Ndakaini, Chemususu and Turkwell, haven&rsquo;t collapsed since construction and there is no reason Itare will be the first to do so.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s wrong for a leader to lie to the world that the surrounding counties were not involved in public participation forums, yet they were part and parcel of the process. I can prove to him that a copy of the EIA reports were shared with the counties, including Bomet,&rdquo; Kones said on his Facebook page.Kones said the Bomet Water executive participated in forums and approved the project.&ldquo;The sudden change of tune by the governor can only be seen in the light of his failure to accomplish water service provision by his county government as elections are just around the corner,&rdquo; he said.Kones said Rutto &ldquo;always speaks the same language as Raila because birds of a feather flock together&rdquo;.
