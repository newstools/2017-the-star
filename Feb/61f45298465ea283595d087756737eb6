Meru Senator Kiraitu Murungi and five MCAs gave cash donations at a harambee despite laws barring politicians from doing so within eight months to the general election.The leaders were invited to the harambee at Mboroga Methodist Church on Sunday, where money was raised for a residential house for the reverend in Kibirichia ward, Buuri subcounty.Kiraitu contributed Sh40,000 while Titus Ntuchiu, his proposed running mate for Meru governor, gave Sh20,000."The law does not allow us to participate in this ... because we will be barred and disqualified. But because your ministry is my neighbour you will come to tell me [how fat the house has gone] and I will come as the Meru governor," Kiraitu said."I want to buy you a goat of Sh40,000 ... 'deputy governor' has [decided that] the goat is not enough and added Sh20,000."Read: Ruto attends 3 harambees to beat fundraiser cut-off deadlineAlso read: Choppers and harambee money: Kanu, Jubilee politicians flex muscles in BaringoMCAs Jacob Mwirigi (Kibirichia), Jeremiah Mureti (Kiirua-Naari), Joy Karambu (Kisima), Jackson Muriiki (Ruiru-Rwarera) and Julius Kirinya (nominated) collectively contributed Sh80,000.Mwiringi gave the host a personal contribution of Sh10,000 and claimed he had been sent by a friend with Sh50,000."I want to receive their contributions; it doesn't matter what name they will call the contributions but when it lands in our hands we will know how to use it," the MCA said.The Electoral Laws Amendments Act, 2016 (64) (1d) bars aspirants from making "any gift, loan, offer, promise procurement or agreement ... to procure the vote".Attempts to get a comment from Kiraitu&rsquo;s communication director Patrick Muriungi were futile after he snubbed the issue.Read: Flak, praise for law that could bar &lsquo;generous&rsquo; politicians from vying
