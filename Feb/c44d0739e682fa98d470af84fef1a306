Claudio Ranieri said his "dream died" when he was sacked by Leicester City nine months after leading them to the Premier League title against all the odds.The Italian was fired on Thursday with Leicester one place above the relegation zone."Yesterday my dream died," Ranieri said in a statement on Friday. "After the euphoria of last season and being crowned Premier League champions all I dreamt of was staying with Leicester; the club I love for always. Sadly this was not to be."The adventure was amazing and will live with me forever."England rugby union coach Eddie Jones expressed sympathy for Ranieri."It's a hard job and you can understand why coaches are so insecure, why we are always looking over our shoulder," Jones, who was sacked by Australia in 2005, told reporters."Life's all about short-term, it's happened in sport, the same thing. Everyone wants results like that and if you don't get them soon, you know you are going to be saying goodbye."I feel sorry for the guy. I must admit, I feel a lot of sympathy for him because things change, teams change," Jones added."He's probably doing the same job he did last season but it's not good enough this year."
