More problems await the medical sector after the Kenya Clinical officers Association issued a strike notice to the government.The association which is the welfare body for all clinical officers in the country are protesting over what it termed as neglect and poor terms and condition of service.The clinical officers who have been running medical facilities across the country during the 80 days doctors strike claimed that they were a &ldquo;forgotten&rdquo; lot in both employment and disbursement of allowances.Speaking in Kapsabet during a meeting with clinical officers on Saturday, the association said their members had taken over the role of doctors while they were not earning any allowances.The association through its chairman Jacob Maswai and secretary Patrick Kenei stated counties had failed to employ new officers and those working had been hired on temporary basis.
