Kitui senator hopeful Enock Wambua yesterday started a nine-day campaign to mobilise people to register in the wake of voter apathy.Flagging off the caravan, Wambua, a former managing editor at Standard Group, was preceded by a morning sermon and prayers at Nairobi&rsquo;s Nyayo Stadium.The worship session was led by AIC priests Cyrus Ukumu and James Njihia, who also presided over the flagging off of the convoy of a branded truck and other vehicles. Wambua said he would address 50 consecutive rallies in all eight Kitui constituencies.Speaking during the commissioning, Wambua added that he is concerned by the sluggish rate of voter registration in Kitui since the launch of the final countrywide mass voter registration two weeks ago.&ldquo;It is our duty to join hands and make a contribution to the mass voter registration. I am doing my part,&rdquo; Wambua said. He added that politics is a game of numbers.Wambua said he is confident Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka will be the next President.He said, &ldquo;The nature of our politics is that those running for the presidency must secure their vote bases and they cannot do it alone. They must be backed by other leaders who believe in them.&rdquo;Wambua said for the love of the people of Kitui he invested in a voter mobilisation caravan and hopes it will help him clinch the Kitui Senate seat.&ldquo;I have a solid network of development partners who are willing to stand with me to transform the lives of our people,&rdquo; he said.In December last year, Wambua was endorsed by church elders to run for the Kitui senatorial seat, a position currently held by David Musila.&ldquo;Kalonzo is our undisputed political kingpin, support his presidential ambition,&rdquo; Wambua urged the Kamba community. &ldquo;I announce to all Kambas of Kitui, Machakos and Makueni counties that the Ukambani political kingpin is Kalonzo. We should thus not be convinced otherwise. That position is not negotiable,&rdquo; he said.
