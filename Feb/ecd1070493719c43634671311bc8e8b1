Kenya Railways Staff Retirement Benefit Scheme has increased monthly pension payout to its 8,500 members by three per cent, the scheme announced yesterday. Under the new terms, schemes pension payout will rise to Sh75 million per month from Sh73 million. The scheme CEO Simon Nyakundi said all pensioners received the increase at the end of last month, in accordance with the maximum allowed as per the Treasury Circular 18 of 2010. &ldquo;The increment was made possible by the successful conclusion of a long-drawn sale of one of the scheme's non-core properties and an improvement in rental collections,&rdquo; he said. Nyakundi said the plan has faced major financial liquidity challenges in the past, resulting in the inability to remit monthly pension regularly to pensioners.However, efforts made by the management and corporate trustee of the scheme, Corporate and Pension Trust Services, a wholly owned subsidiary of Alexander Forbes financial services East Africa, have enabled the programme achieve a better footing, he said.A once-off pension increase of Sh1,000 was awarded in July 1, 2014. This has seen the scheme increase its monthly payout to members from Sh55 million, three years ago, to Sh75 million.The lowest paid member earnings have increased by 75 per cent to about Sh3,500.&ldquo;We target to increase pension to a minimum of Sh 5,000 as soon as we resolve issues around liquidity, sustainability and affordability,&rdquo; Nyakundi said.Recently, the scheme paid Sh200 million in pension arrears, which were outstanding since January 2005.
