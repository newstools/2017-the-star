A group of women and youth in Tudor ward have been organising talent shows and other entertainment activities to woo youth to register as voters.The group, led by political and human rights activist Jane Wanjiru, has for two weeks been conducting door-to-door voter listing campaigns.She said that by Sunday, they had convinced about 3,980 people to register to vote. &ldquo;We had targeted 5,000 people,&rdquo; Wanjiru said.Wanjiru and Fareed Abdullah had urged the IEBC to extend voter registration by at least a week to allow more youth to register as voters. But IEBC chief executive Ezra Chiloba on Monday said registration will not be extended.There has been voter apathy among youth in Mombasa but Wanjiru said this is due to failure by leaders to solve their problems, especially lack of jobs.
