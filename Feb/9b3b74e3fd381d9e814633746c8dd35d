The Parliamentary Public Investments Committee has ordered the Kenya Pipeline Company to halt an additional payment of Sh11 billion for the Mombasa&ndash;Nairobi pipeline.PIC chairman Adan Keynan said the committee is concerned about the additional costs to the project, which he said will overburden the taxpayer.&ldquo;The committee has today ordered KPC not to accept the cost variation made by Zakhem International on the Mombasa&ndash;Nairobi pipeline,&rdquo; Keynan said.He was speaking at KPC headquarters during an inspection visit of line five enhancement project by the PIC. The Sh48 billion project is the country&rsquo;s second-largest infrastructure undertaking. KPC&rsquo;s managing director Joe Sang&rsquo; said the pipeline construction is being undertaken under the international standards organisation for the consulting engineering and construction, which has clear conditions for handling, among other things, claims.&ldquo;The claim by Zakhem International is being reviewed under FIDIC contract conditions. It is therefore not possible for KPC to undertake payment of claim before going through this process,&rdquo; Sang&rsquo; said.He said the overall project is 78 per cent complete, while the construction of the actual pipeline is 90 per cent complete.&ldquo;KPC&rsquo;s focus now is on the construction and installation of equipment at the new pump stations,&rdquo; Sang&rsquo; said.
