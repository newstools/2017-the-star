ODM has refuted claims that Nasa has named Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka as its flag bearer, as alleged in a letter circulating on social media.National Super Alliance leaders did not name a presidential candidate after signing an agreement on Wednesday at the Okoa Kenya secretariat.Their deal outlined seven key pillars on they will anchor their campaign to remove President Uhuru Kenyatta from power.This was signed by Raila Odinga (ODM), Musalia Mudavadi (Amani), Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper) and Moses Wetang'ula (Ford Kenya).Moments after, a statement purporting that Kalonzo would be the coalition's flag bearer was widely shared on social media.The document had the signature of Siaya Senator James Orengo - chair of the 12-member steering committee working on the Nasa plan. ODM communications director Philip Etale accused Jubilee of propagating the lies."Jubilee, you will forever be desperate. Even your desperation will not make Jesus notice you when he comes back," Etale said on Twitter. He claimed the document was allegedly crafted by Jubilee and that it is not only fake but also malicious."Even a silly dog in the village will know the document Jubilee is spreading around is as fake as their ideas," he said.Raila's spokesman Dennis Onyango asked Kenyans to "ignore the rubbish", adding that Nasa documents are signed by all the members of the steering committee."The documents are not signed by Orengo alone. As things stand today, Nasa has no letterhead or logo, contrary to what appears here," Onyango said."We, however, understand that desperate times will continue attracting desperate measures from Jubilee," he told the Star.But the director of Jubilee campaign communication team, Albert Memusi, denied that Jubilee was responsible for the letter."We are not that cheap. We have not done anything like that. In fact we are encouraging them to come together because we need a worthy competitor," he told the Star via phone.The document, which is labelled 'confidential', quotes Orengo saying that the Nasa steering committee agreed that Kalonzo should be named the presidential candidate "pending ratification of this decision by the Nasa delegates forum on March 22, 2017".Nasa will hold its first rally in Eldoret town following the signing of the agreement.Raila said all Kenyans are invited to the meeting where they will explain their August poll agenda to members of the public."Our first public function will be this Saturday in Eldoret. We will officially announce to Kenyans that Nasa is alive and kicking," he said.More on this: Nasa unveils team of 12 to register, identify flag bearer for electionThe coalition's coordinating committee was unveiled in January and hit the ground running to spearhead the search for its presidential candidate.Nasa leaders Raila, Kalonzo, Musalia, and Wetang'ula said the team will also select a running mate for the presidential candidate.The general election could well be a rematch between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila, despite talk of another joint opposition flag bearer.More on this: Raila still wants to be NASA 2017 candidateAlso read: High hurdles on road to a single NASA candidate
