Chiefs from Teso South subcounty, Busia, have been accused of denying IDs to Ugandan women married in Kenya.Speaking at Olepito, Pasama, Ochude and Kemodo trading centres, the women from Uganda said the chiefs and assistant chiefs have denied them Kenyan IDs.They said the chiefs&rsquo; decision to deny them the IDs is a violation of their democratic right to vote. The women said the administrators have given them tough conditions to be fulfilled before they can get IDs.&ldquo;We have the right to get Kenyan IDs and vote because we are married here and we have families. Why should we be denied the opportunity to vote for the leaders we prefer?&rdquo; one woman said.One of the chiefs said the law requires any woman from a foreign country married in Kenya to produce a signed letter from the Immigration department of her home country before they can get a Kenyan ID.&ldquo;We are doing this because Busia and Malaba are border towns,&rdquo; the chief said.
