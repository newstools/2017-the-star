Two ODM aspirants defied a bishop&rsquo;s entreaty not to hurl insults at a funeral and abused each other. &ldquo;All we need is peace. Those who throw insults at each other don&rsquo;t qualify to be leaders,&rdquo; ACK Bishop Mwai Abiero said at the funeral service of former councillor John Okello on Saturday in Rarieda. But Knut national vice chairman Collins Oyuu called former Ombudsman Otiende Amollo incompetent. The two are eyeing the Rarieda MP seat. &ldquo;I have been a teacher who has worked in this region for a long time and I know the problems our people face. We are not going to allow somebody to come from nowhere to claim leadership of this constituency,&rdquo; Oyuu said. Otiende said in response, &ldquo;If my brother Oyuu thinks that Parliament is a school where people debate on who between a teacher and a lawyer is better than the other, then he should think twice.&rdquo; They were at Kandaria Secondary School. The other aspirant is Netto Adhola.
