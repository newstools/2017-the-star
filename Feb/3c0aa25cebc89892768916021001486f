Kenya Sevens head coach Innocent Simiyu has hinted at changes for the upcoming two legs of the World Rugby Series in Las Vegas and Vancouver next month.Simiyu may recall the players who impressed in Cape Town, where Kenya qualified for the Main Cup quarter-finals after his experiment with the experienced players failed to fire in Wellington and Sydney, where Kenya bagged a paltry ten points out of the estimated 20.Players in line for recall may include Homeboyz utility back Cyprian Kuto, Martin Owila, Darwin Mukidza and Frank Wanyama. The team is set to resume training this week and Simiyu has promised a thorough review of what went wrong in Wellington and Sydney after a lacklustre display.&ldquo;Training resumes this week and we are looking at a through review to see where we went wrong. We want to get everything right for the next two tournaments,&rdquo; he said. He exuded confidence that he expects performances to improve in the coming events.&ldquo;Our preparations were quite good; leading up to Wellington and Sydney. But when it got to game day, we didn&rsquo;t get the results we wanted. We played well but let down our guard at those critical moments. We committed a lot of errors&mdash;an average of five errors in attack and four to six in defense and it really affected our performance, especially in the critical games,&rdquo; added Simiyu. Elsewhere, Kenya will open their campaign for the Las Vegas leg against New Zealand, according to the fixtures released over the weekend.In their previous meeting, Kenya lost 28-7 in Cape Town in the Main Cup quarterfinal. They will then face Argentina, who they lost to 17-12 in Wellington. They have only registered one win against the Pumas in Singapore, where they won 15-12 in the Main Cup semis courtesy of a penalty by Collins Injera.They conclude their preliminary fixture against the Russians, who beat Kenya 22-0 in Sydney with Kenya edging them 24-5 in Wellington.
