Through Wamatangi Foundation, we are helping the new residents to register to vote,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We should all focus on reaching the IEBC target. Residents must make sure we have numbers to vote in preferred leaders.&rdquo;Wamatangi urged parents to encourage their children aged 18 and over to get voter&rsquo;s cards.
