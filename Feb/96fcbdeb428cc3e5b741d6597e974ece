The Teachers' Service Commission should not take more than a month to issue registration certificates to trained teachers so they do not miss out on jobs opportunities, Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang&rsquo;i has said.Teachers need the certificate to get jobs and should not suffer for lack of the documents, he said.Matiang&rsquo;i said he has received a number of complaints from teachers that TSC has been taking too long to release the certificates. But the commission has no reason for the delay, he added.The CS spoke on Friday during a graduation ceremony at Murang&rsquo;a Teachers Training College.He also called for modern teaching methods to ensure local education standards are raised to international levels.&ldquo;We need to move towards using Information Communication Technology in teaching to reduce overdependence on the traditional modes of curriculum delivery that have serious challenges,&rdquo; Matiang'i said.He praised the current teacher training curriculum that has incorporated ICT. He, however, said Kenya is yet to achieve the goal of universal student-teacher ICT literacy that was to be achieved between 2002 and 2008.The government is working on a new curriculum that will be implemented in all levels of education to enhance talents of individual students, Matiang'i said.&ldquo;This is part of the various reforms that we are undertaking in the education sector to ensure children access high quality education,&rdquo; he said.The ministry has started developing a comprehensive Education Data Management Information System that will guide planning and disbursement of education funds, Matiang'i said.In December 2016, President Uhuru Kenyatta directed the ministry to issue all students with a Unique Personal Identifier and stop the use of index numbers for national exams.Matiang&rsquo;i said that by March 10, all students will have received their unique personal identifier.The UPI will be globally recognised and will be used to identify individual students all through their education.The UPI, he said, will also be used by the government in allocation of funds to schools starting this financial year.&ldquo;This system, when fully implemented, will lead to a better and more personalised delivery of education services and will help to completely streamline the sector,&rdquo; Matiang&rsquo;i said.
