Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga is under pressure to win the support of the greater Ugenya constituency, where his in-laws come from, despite falling out with area leadership.He differed with Siaya Senator James Orengo and area MP David Ochieng. Ochieng has said he will not support Rasanga&rsquo;s reelection. He instead backs Rarieda MP Nicholas Gumbo for governor. Rasanga is said to be &ldquo;planting&rdquo; new MCA aspirants to split votes for his perceived arch-rivals and maintain status quo ahead of the ODM nominations.Ukwala MCA Peter Omondi said the governor has roped in Susan Akinyi ,allegedly to split the votes and ensure incumbent Jack Odinga retains the seat.The Ukwala ward seat has attracted former Ukwala town council chairman Sylvester Wire and Omondi, a bursar at Rang&rsquo;ala Girls High School, who is viewed as the front runner.
