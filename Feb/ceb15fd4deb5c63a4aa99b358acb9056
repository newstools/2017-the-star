A boda boda operator&rsquo;s ear was bitten off by a client who refused to pay Sh100 fare in Lumama village, Lugari. Kamalila Achwanya on Monday said the client hired him on Sunday to take him to Lumakanda to visit his lover. They agreed on Sh250 fare. &ldquo;When we came back, he refused to honour the agreement, instead giving Sh150. We started arguing. He grabbed me. In the struggle he bit off my left ear before taking off,&rdquo; Achwanya said.He was rushed to Lumakanda Hospital and transferred to Webuye Hospital. Achwanya said the man may have swallowed his ear or gone away with it as it was not found at the scene. The attacker, only identified as Andrew, was later seized by villagers and beaten senseless. He is in critical condition at the MTRH, Eldoret. Residents said he has a habit of biting people&rsquo;s ears and disappearing from the village.
