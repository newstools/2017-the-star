More business is expected at the Port of Mombasa after Singapore&rsquo;s Pacific International Lines and China&rsquo;s Guangzhou Yansha Development Zone partnered to increase their investments.PIL, the fourteenth largest container liner company in the world, and Guangzhou have agreed to build more rail and road connections in East and Southern Africa.The two companies signed a strategic cooperation agreement in Mombasa last week, sealing a deal to cover Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, South Sudan, Zambia and Malawi.The trade pact was signed by Guangzhou&rsquo;s Zhang Benhua and Yong Wang, PIL East Africa representative Nandar Warrier, and Kenya Shipping Agency Association CEO Juma Tellah.&ldquo;PIL is a leading carrier providing reliable and prompt service covering all major and minor ports in China. China is an important partner for East African countries and the cooperation will increase with Chinese participation in major infrastructure and development projects,&rdquo; Warrier said.PIL, which began its services to Africa in the 1960s, covers the ports of Mombasa, Dar es Salaam and other regional ports including Zanzibar, Tanga, Mtwara and Pemba.The partnership is expected to increase cargo volumes to the region as China remains the key source for raw material and finished products.&ldquo;From the total cargo movement from China, Guangzhou region accounts for approximately 25, and with the development of Nansha free zone, this is expected to increase,&rdquo; Warrier said. He said the MoU will open East Africa for new business opportunities.&ldquo;PIL and Guanzhou Nansha free trade zone will work together in establishing wider cooperation and business opportunities to develop Mombasa as the major logistics hub for the region and beyond,&rdquo; Warrier said.The two have also set sights on Kenya&rsquo;s Special Economic Zones being developed by the government. Kenya is counting on incentives under the SEZ to attract fresh foreign direct investments.President Uhuru Kenyatta in September 2015 signed the Special Economic Zones Act 2015, which spells out key measures to revamp activities in the blocs.The law offers incentives such as a 100 per cent waiver on corporate tax for investment above $2.4 million (Sh248.9 million), until the full cost of investment is recovered.&ldquo;This is a key incentive available to investors in different sectors,&rdquo; KenInvest managing director Moses Ikiara told the Star.SEZs are undergoing a pilot programme in Mombasa, Lamu and Kisumu.Benhua said: &ldquo;PIL is operating in 100 countries with over 140 ships of 360,000 TEUs, occupying 1.7 per cent of the global shipping market share. The partnership will see growth of business.&rdquo;Mombasa remains a key entry point for the region mainly serving the hinterland nations of Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and South Sudan.
