There are 96,752 drug addicts and more than 60 peddlers in Mombasa, Jubilee Coast point man Suleiman Shahbal has claimed.He said about 40,000 of the addicts are youths between the ages of 12 and 17. The county&rsquo;s population is about 939,400. This would mean that about 10 per cent of the population consists of addicts. &ldquo;Since 2010, some 6,725 died of drug overdose,&rdquo; Shahbal said. He said the government will hunt down peddlers. He spoke during a press conference at the Jubilee Party office in Nyali.Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho said Shahbal&rsquo;s figures are exaggerated.On January 31, two sons of slain drug baron Ibrahim Akasha - Ibrahim and Baktash - were extradited to the US alongside their partners Gulam Hussein (Pakistani) and Vijaygiri Goswami (Indian).He said drug peddling should be made a capital offence and barons hanged.The war on drugs has turned political. Several politicians, including Joho, were mentioned in a US embassy report of people linked to the drugs trade.Joho has denied involvement and dared the Jubilee government to arrest him if they have enough evidence.On Tuesday, he said he is being targeted by Jubilee. Joho said, &ldquo;No one has ever summoned me over drugs. These are fabricated lies to block me from defending my seat.&rdquo;Shahbal said Jubilee is not targetting anyone. He said President Uhuru Kenyatta is sincere about fighting the drugs menace. Critics have questioned why the President waited until the election period to lauch an anti-narcotics campaign.Shahbal said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care whether they call it political. Drug trafficking should be made a capital offence.&rdquo;Data from the National Campaign against Drug Abuse Authority show there are more than 100,000 heroin addicts at the Coast.Mombasa alone is said to have 20,000 heroin drug addicts, NGO Reachout Trust Centre has said.
