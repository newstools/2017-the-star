Thika Stadium is out of bounds for political events, at least for now, to allow for renovations.Kiambu Sports executive Machel Waikenda yesterday said the stadium has been closed for construction and renovations.NASA had planned to hold its maiden rally in Central in the stadium on Saturday. NASA leaders made the announcement during their rally in Eldoret town last Saturday.They have, however, postponed it. It is not clear if this has to do with the ban. Thika is the headquarters of Kiambu, President Uhuru Kenyatta's home county.Waikenda said the facility has been in a poor state and the Football Kenya Federation had banned its use for sporting events."We don't want anyone to politicise the use of the stadium. We are not prioritising any political events and rallies. Our priority will be sports tournament during this period," he said. Waikenda spoke at the Kiambu county headquarters.He said once the renovations are complete, the department will make a public announcement.Waikenda said the county hopes to have the facility used for the the 2018 African Nations Championship next year. He said talks are at an advanced stage.Waikenda said the organisers will visit the stadium soon to inspect it, hence the need to renovate it and keep politicians at bay.&ldquo;We want to ensure the stadium meets world-class standards as we strive to nurture talent. Initially, FKF banned the stadium from participating in its events. This was a huge blow to Kiambu sports teams as the stadium is their home club,&rdquo; he said.Currently, only sports events are allowed into the stadium as the contractors do touch ups to conform with the FIFA standards.
