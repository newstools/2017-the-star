Bandits have raided the Kerio Valley two days after Elgeyo Marakwet Governor Alex Tolgos asked the state to send KDF officers to end the mayhem.The suspected Pokot bandits, armed with AK-47 rifles, raided Arapat in Tunyo on Saturday afternoon. They stole 30 cows. Area assistant chief Christopher Kiptoo said the eight bandits engaged the Marakwet herders in a fierce gun battle, before taking the livestock across the Kerio River to Baringo East.He said police reservists were overpowered by the heavily armed bandits. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s difficult to recover animals that have crossed over to East Pokot. Security officers can&rsquo;t risk their lives, because bandits often launch retaliatory attacks,&rdquo; Kiptoo said.Marakwet West police boss Apollo Onyonyi said calm has been restored and they are pursuing the bandits. Tolgos said the insecurity situation in the Kerio Valley has degenerated into a national crisis. &ldquo;We talk about having more than 200 police officers in the Kerio Valley, yet security is not improving. It&rsquo;s high time the President deploys KDF officers,&rdquo; the governor said.He urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to use his constitutional powers to restore normalcy in the area.
