Two people were injured on Tuesday night by a troop of monkeys and baboons that invaded a village in Ijara constituency, Garissa, to look for water.Residents told journalists more than 30 primates stormed Welmare village, Sangailu, at 6pm.The villagers and the animals fought for several hours. &ldquo;The thirsty baboons and monkeys invaded the village in droves. They targeted a hut in which a family had some water, which they had bought from a vendor. A serious fight broke out between the family and the primates. The family members were protecting the water as the monkeys tried to snatch away the 10 litre jerrycan,&rdquo; resident Abdi Mohamed said. He said the family&rsquo;s cries for help saved the day as neighbours joined in and chased away the monkeys and baboons.Two people suffered facial scratches as they fought with the monkeys. They were treated at Masalani Referral Hospital and discharged.Ijara Supkem branch chairman Abdikhadir Hassan said drivers sent by the government to take free water to communities in Ijara and Hullugho subcounties with bowsers are using it to benefit themselves.&ldquo;People are forced to buy the water from the bowsers, which have been mobilised by the government to address the water needs in several villages in the two subcounties,&rdquo; he said. Water pans have dried up.Hassan said the drivers of the public bowsers are selling the commodity for Sh100 per 20 litres. At least 10 people have been killed and several others injured in human-wildlife conflicts over scarcity of water in Ijara, and Hullugho subcounties in the last four months.In October last year, the Kenya Wildlife Service warned people living near wild animals and parks of conflicts due to the drought.
