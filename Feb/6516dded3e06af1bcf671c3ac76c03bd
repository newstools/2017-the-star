Leading oil marketer Vivo Energy yesterday reopened the Shell service station in Karai, Naivasha, that was the scene of a tussle and gun drama with nominated Senator Paul Njoroge on February 7. The gas station will now operate under new management led by Hasnaim Noorani. The move comes after the company controversially terminated the contract with Njoroge, the former retailer. Vivo&rsquo;s retail manager Lena Munuve said the company will continue to increase tank capacities and open more Shell service stations.&ldquo;We have put a lot of resources and energy to ensure that all customers that come to this station leave feeling as guests,&rdquo; Munuve said. Noorani said his team will ensure services delivered satisfy customers' needs and are in line with Vivo&rsquo;s standards.
