Shelter-Afrique&rsquo;s managing director James Mugerwa has resigned. He completed a two-year stint, which fell short of the ideal five-year at the listed pan-African mortgage lender.Chairman Jean Missi said Mugerwa is leaving the company to pursue other interests. &ldquo;The board of Shelter-Afrique has amicably accepted the resignation of James Mugerwa from the position of managing director with effect from February 1, 2017. The board wishes Mugerwa every success in his future endeavours.&rdquo; Missi said. He said Femi Adele will take over as the acting managing director and Oumar Diop as the acting deputy MD with immediate effect. Vipya Harawa retains his position as company secretary. The developments come after the lender was given the go-ahead to implement a raft of measures to bolster its operations and push its agenda of promoting affordable housing.Among them is the bridge financing from the African Development Bank, allowing the transfer of $8.2 million (Sh851.2 million) and a subsequent line of $20 million (Sh2.1 billion) to shore up Shelter Afrique in the short term.During an extraordinary general meeting in Nairobi on Wednesday, members adopted the Deloitte forensic report and its recommendations, which exposed malpractices in the running of the company. The report linked top managers to massive looting of funds through creative accounting and subprime lending at the company. The board had last week said it will punish those involved.&ldquo;What we are faced with today is not only a liquidity crisis but an opportunity to reshape and reinvent the way we deliver affordable housing,&rdquo; Missi said.&ldquo;I am confident that our deliberations and resolutions today will send a strong signal to the markets that we do not take housing lightly and we do not take Shelter Afrique lightly either.&rdquo;
