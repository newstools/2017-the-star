They have until March 11.The contractors were given the tenders in 2013-14 and 2014-15 to construct 210 classrooms that have a capacity for 50 pupils."So far out of 210 classrooms that were earmarked for construction during the two financial years, 179 classrooms have been completed and are in use," he said.Thirty-one classrooms have stalled, denying 1,550 children access to conducive learning environments.Education chief officer Adelaide Auma said, "Failure to adhere to the notice will lead to automatic cancellation of the contract, with the possibility of recovery of any funds paid above level of work done."She added that the county will give contracts for the construction of 69 more ECDE classrooms next week.The goal is to have one EDCDE classroom in all the 439 public schools countywide, Auma said.County Director for ECDE Douglas Barasa said the 439 teachers interviewed last year will receive their letters on Wednesday in a ceremony at the Busia Polytechnic to be presided over by Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong.Public Service Management chief officer Patricia Okello said the letters are being processed and successful candidates will report to the schools on March 1.
