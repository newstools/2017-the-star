The Central Bank has downgraded Kenya's economic growth forecast to 5.7 per cent in 2017 from 5.9 per cent last year, citing uncertainties in the global economy amid a ravaging drought.Agriculture, which is the mainstay of the economy, is expected to give less output following a prolonged period of dry weather which has hit the food-producing regions.CBK governor Patrick Njoroge says it also remains unclear how the economy will react after Britain starts the process to leave the European Union following June 23 referendum vote popularly known as Brexit.This is coupled with uncertainties over the direction of US policy under the new government of Donald Trump.However, the forecast did indicate whether the economy will be affected by the general election, though independent economists expect the August 7 polls to have a negative effect.&ldquo;There are increased uncertainties with regard to the prevailing drought conditions and risks in the global markets,&rdquo; the governor said yesterday at a media briefing.He said the banking sector is expected to continue growing, having recorded notable growth in 2016, with an expanded asset base, increased capitalisation and improved profitability. CBK data shows the average commercial banks&rsquo; liquidity ratio and capital adequacy ratios stood at 41.4 per cent and 18.7 per cent, respectively, in December 2016. &ldquo;The Market Perception Survey showed that banks and non-bank private sector firms expect strong growth in 2017, supported by continued public investment in infrastructure, recovery of tourism and relatively low oil prices,&rdquo; he said.This is expected to drive private sector credit growth, which stabilised at 4.3 per cent in December, driven by lending to trade, real estate, private households and consumer durables. The governor said they have kept a keen eye on the forex exchange market to maintain stability of the local currency.The shilling remained relatively stable between 100 and 103 units to the dollar throughout 2016.Njoroge said stability has largely been maintained using foreign exchange reserves, which currently stand at $6.93 billion (4.5 months of import cover).&ldquo;We have adequate buffers to support the shilling. The dollar reserves, together with the precautionary arrangements with the International Monetary Fund continue to provide an adequate buffer against short-term shocks,&rdquo; he said.
