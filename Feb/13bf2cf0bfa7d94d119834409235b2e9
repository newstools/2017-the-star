The IEBC is racing against time, facing high hurdles and confronting tough choices in trying to meet strict demands of the Elections Act.Some might call it a mission impossible.The most pressing issue is the all-important and complex integrated ICT component, which hasn't been decided or acquired.Further, the tender has not been awarded for audit of the flawed voter's register, which the opposition says will be manipulated to rig the August 8 polls.The tender to supply ballot materials has been blocked by Cord.The validity of the amended Elections Act itself is being challenged by the opposition.And the Kenyan diaspora, estimated at three million voters, threatens to sue to stop registration because voting won't be global &mdash; it will be limited to East Africa and South Africa.The ICT component, some of which failed in the 2013 election, is the biggest headache. Decisions and purchase have been delayed by legal challenges.Yesterday the Star established the electoral commission is considering either outsourcing purchase of Electronic Voter Identification Devices from another country, or revamping and using the EVIDS used in the 2013 polls. Some of them malfunctioned.The clock is ticking and it is possible the new technology IEBC intends to acquire will arrive too late for the critical, month-long biometric verification of voters. What then?The verification is to begins on May 10 and the Kenya Integrated Electoral Management System (KIEMS) is yet to be acquired.The system covers all the technology the IEBC intends to use. It includes biometric registration of voters, biometric verification of voters, electronic transmission of results and the management of candidates for the election.Yesterday, agency CEO Ezra Chiloba said the two options &mdash; outsourcing or updating and using the old system &mdash; are on the table and the commission is to decide this week.&ldquo;We haven't really narrowed down what it would be but we are already looking at a number of options. Either using the EVIDS that didn't work in the last elections. But this would require a lot of revamping. Batteries need to be fixed, we need to get some accessories that could be missing...if it goes that way, we need to replace some [EVIDS] with new ones, so it's a bit complicated,&rdquo; Chiloba told the Star yesterday.&ldquo;The other option is looking at outsourcing from one of the countries that have used this and have all the items. But we haven't narrowed down. It's a decision the commission will make this week.&rdquo;Verification of the voter's register is critical after the commission, in a startling admission of a flawed register, acknowledged 128,926 Kenyans share ID or passport numbers in its database.But as the IEBC addresses the technology challenge, Kenyans in the diaspora say they will sue the electoral commission for restricting voter registration to the East African Community and South Africa.The likely suit will compound the IEBC is already fighting, even as it seeks an out-of-court settlement with Cord on the audit of the voter register.Cord says a corrupted register will be used to rig the election and demands a scrupulous audit.However, the law requires the IEBC to implement audit recommendations by February 17. That can't happen, as Cord obtained an injunction halting award of the audit tender. It wants an independent outside firm to examine the register.It argues the IEBC failed to &ldquo;set the benchmark and rules for the audit process&rdquo;.It is also challenging the award of tender to supply ballot papers. It opposes purchase decisions by the former commissioners and questions the impartiality of the secretariat.Further, it is challenging the Senate's approval of the contentious Election law amendments, which, among other things, allow backup manual if electronic systems fail.Yesterday, the Kenya Diaspora Alliance, representing 34 lobby groups of Kenyans living abroad, protested that the IEBC has failed to implement a Supreme Court directive issued in 2015, to ensure diaspora Kenyans vote.&ldquo;We have no option but to go to court,&rdquo; Dr Shem Ochuodho, the alliance global chairman, told the Star.Ochuodho challenged President Uhuru Kenyatta, Cord leader Raila Odinga and ANC party Boss Musalia Mudavadi to state clearly whether they actually want Kenyans abroad to vote.&ldquo;We are also taking the battle to the doorstep of the President," he said."Whenever he has been abroad, he has told diaspora, you are my 48th county, you are my richest county, my government cannot ignore you. We are not seeing this now. So we are putting him to task as leader of Jubilee Party [to tell us] what is their position. Do they support or they don't support diaspora?&rdquo; Ochuodho said.On Wednesday, IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati dashed the hopes of many overseas Kenyansand announced that only Kenyans in South Africa and the four East African countries will be allowed to vote. They are in Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi and were allowed to vote in 2013. And now South Africa.&ldquo;Unfortunately, based on the changes that came in the new law, practically we cannot extend those countries beyond Africa,&rdquo; commissioner Roselyn Kwamboka said.Chebukati said the time constraint was the main reason for cancelling the original plan for a global diaspora vote.&ldquo;The law allows for progressive registration and voting by Kenyans in the diaspora and more countries will be included in future,&rdquo; he said.But Chris Njenga, KDA&rsquo;s team chair on diaspora voting, said they will see an injunction to stop any registration as they seek the Supreme Court's interpretation to ensure all overseas Kenyans are listed.There are an estimated three million diaspora voters, who could well decide the presidential election, if they are allowed to vote.Yesterday, Chiloba said the commission is negotiating with the opposition for an out-of-court settlement on audit of the voter's register.&ldquo;The audit had its timelines and we are already late. Nonetheless, we welcome the proposal to have the matter resolved out of court so we are able to move forward,&rdquo;Chiloba said.
