A Garissa activist yesterday claimed the rehabilitation sponsorship of reformed al Shabaab militants by the Kenya Red Cross Society will in future be used to victimise hundreds of beneficiaries.Human right activist Ali Awdol said some students at the Garissa Technical Training College who are given financial aid have not been told the purpose of the sponsorship. He spoke during a youth forum at a Garissa hotel. The sponsorship programme started early last year and more than 100 students are beneficiaries.Awdol said he is privy to information the financial aid to poor students is meant for Somalia-based militants seeking rehabilitation.&ldquo;Hundreds of poor children have applied and are sponsored under this programme, but unfortunately they have not been told the purpose of the projects, as they will be disadvantaged in future,&rdquo; he said.Awdol said the names of these individuals sponsored will in future be marked as those of radicals who were once al Shabaab fighters.He demanded immediate explanation from the Kenya Red Cross Society about the programme, saying it is unethical to just continue enlisting youth for sponsorship without revealing to them such sensitive information. Awdol said the beneficiaries are likely to be blacklisted and this will make it hard for them to find jobs.The Garissa Technical Training College management authority, who were also in attendance, expressed shock over the allegations, saying they are not aware the sponsorship is meant for former al Shabaab members.
