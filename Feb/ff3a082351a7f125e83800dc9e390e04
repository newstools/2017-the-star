Roughly ten years ago, headlines with references to &ldquo;bodies found in a nearby forest&rdquo; were quite common in our newspapers. This black mark on the record of the Kibaki government, reflected what was widely considered to be a war of extermination waged against the Mungiki cult by special units within our security apparatus. There was never any serious attempt to find out who was behind these killings, leaving the impression on many minds that it was official policy to give the Mungiki (a hyper-violent sect in its heyday) no quarter, and to suspend the rule of law when it came to dealing with those believed to be foot-soldiers of this sect. The murder of three brothers from Nakuru County, and a fourth man, said to be their cousin, bears all the hallmarks of this dark chapter in Kenyan history: they were abducted in broad daylight in Nakuru, and their mangled bodies were found in a forest in Thika. It is up to the our security forces to act promptly in investigating these murders, if Kenyans are not to be left nervously looking over their shoulders, wondering if this signals the return of extra-judicial killings.
