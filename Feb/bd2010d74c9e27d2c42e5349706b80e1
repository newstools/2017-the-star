Starehe MP Maina Kamanda has denied claims that there is division among Jubilee leaders in Nairobi over who should vie for governor. Jubilee MPs are divided into two factions, one supporting former presidential aspirant Peter Kenneth and the other backing Senator Mike Sonko.Some Jubilee MPs allied to Sonko have accused Kenneth of being an &ldquo;outsider and spoiler.&rdquo; Kamanda, who is said to be supporting Kenneth&rsquo;s candidacy, said Jubilee is a democratic party and any person is welcome to seek its nomination. &ldquo;Such competition is very healthy. It shows that we in Jubilee are a mature democracy,&rdquo; Kamanda told journalists on Friday in Mombasa&rsquo;s Whitesands Hotel.
