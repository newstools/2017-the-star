Health CS Cleopa Mailu has accused PS Nicholas Muraguri of undermining his authority during negotiations to end the doctors' strike.Mailu said Muraguri was one of those he appointed to the mediating team, alongside other ministry officials and Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli.But Muraguri replied in a memo removing himself from the team, he said on Tuesday when he appeared before the Senate Health committee chaired by Migori Senator Wilfred Machage.The Cabinet Secretary said he could not participate in the talks as he was attending to other official matters."There are no wrangles in the ministry but what happened is what we in management call insubordination,&rdquo; he said.This was his answer to Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale's question on why Muraguri was lackluster in efforts to end the strike that has lasted 73 days now.Atwoli on Sunday accused the Principal Secretary of of sabotaging the negotiations and asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to intervene. &ldquo;There is infighting in the ministry and that is why we have been unable to agree on doctors' pay. I urge the President to intervene and separate the minister and the PS,&rdquo; he said.Atwoli further accused Muraguri of inciting doctors against the CS to portray him as incompetent so that he (Mailu) can be impeached.He spoke at Mukuyuni Catholic Church in Kaiti, Makueni county.Read: Atwoli intervention hands doctors union another 7 days for talksAlso read: I am unable to end the doctors strike - AtwoliMailu told the committee &ldquo;he will do anything possible to ensure doctors' union officials are released from prison.Judge Hellen Wasilwa effected their month-long sentence on Monday, saying they had to be punished for disobeying the court.But the CS noted he was already in talks with Attorney General Githu Muigai for the next legal step to be taken.He said the doctors could have ended the stalemate in two days (by today) had they not been imprisoned.Mailu also said he was confident he could "bring the doctors to the negotiating table again&rdquo;.&ldquo;We have a situation which was unprecedented. It is indeed sad that the strike has gone on for more than 70 days. It is not the intention of anybody to see doctors go to jail - it is a sad moment,&rsquo; he told the committee.But he added: &ldquo;I assure this committee that we shall do whatever is possible to get to the table to see what to do to end the strike. I had a conversation with the AG and the chairman of the doctors' negotiating team this morning. We agreed to see [that doctors are released]."Mailu said patients can seek medical services at health centres and dispensaries managed by nurses and clinical officers while expectant mothers can go to mission hospitals.The government will pay for the services, he said.Senators Wilfred Lesan (Bomet), Godliver Omondi (Nominated), Mvita Mshenga (Nominated) and Zipporah Kittony (Nominated) asked Mailu to resign if unable to end the strike.The Cabinet Secretaryis expected to return to the committee to give a progress report on the release of the CBA 7'.[VIDEO] Mailu to bail out doctors serving month-long prison sentence
