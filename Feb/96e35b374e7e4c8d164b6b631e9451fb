A Kisumu resident wants a portion of his land that he says was illegally acquired by Nairobi Governor Evens Kidero returned to him.Peter Ochola took Kidero to court on Thursday, accusing him of purchasing his property at Korando area in the county.Ochola said he bought his property from a man named Peter Angira in 2005.He said he later got involved in an accident and was discharged on July 5, 2010, only to find the land fenced and developed.Ochola told the Environment and Land Court in Kisumu that when he asked, he was told the Governor had bought his property.The man said that upon further inquiry, he learned that Angira had sold another portion of the land to Murithi Mbui, who then sold it to Kidero.Ochola claimed Kidero ignored the fact that he owned part of the land and fenced the whole piece.He said his repeated demands to the Governor for the mistake to be corrected bore no fruit.But Kidero told justice SM Kibunja from the witness stand that he legally bought the property from Mbui, and that he followed due procedure.&ldquo;The documents used to purchase the land have been unchallenged for the last nine years I have had it,&ldquo; he said.But Kidero told the court that he was willing to help Ochola acquire his property if the suit is dropped.&ldquo;We had a brief discussion at the bench. I found out that our mothers actually come from the same place," said the Governor."We may not have come to an agreement but I can help him get land if he wants me to."The case will be heard on May 18.
