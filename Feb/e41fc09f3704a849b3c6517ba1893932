Burger, who in the country to conduct clinics across the country courtesy of Bhubesi Pride, said Kenya stands a good chance of qualifying to the Rugby World Cup in Japan in two years time. &ldquo;Kenya have made very good strides and almost qualified for the last edition in England and so with the right structures and commitment from everyone, they may qualify,&rdquo; added Burger.Namibia have represented Africa in the past five World Cups without much success and Burger said the competition in Africa rugby is growing. &ldquo;If Kenya and Namibia play well and other countries come along, we will give Europe teams a run for their money. Obviously, I hope Namibia goes to the World Cup but I think Kenya has a realistic chance of making it because they have really have good players,&rdquo; he addedBurger hailed the appointment of South African Jerome Paarwater as Kenya Simbas&rsquo; coach in 2013, saying the move had turned around Kenya&rsquo;s fortunes.&ldquo;He comes from great rugby playing tradition in South Africa and he has brought his skills and winning mindset to the national team. We can see his work bearing fruits now,&rdquo; added Burger. The Simbas are currently ranked 24th in the World and are targeting to climb into the top 20 this year.Kenya 15s are set to take on Namibia, Uganda, Zimbabwe, Senegal and Tunisia in the Africa Cup 1A as well as possible tests against Germany and Romania.
