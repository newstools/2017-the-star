Kajiado is a market centre and a commercial hub. Banks with a presence here include Kenya Commercial Bank, Equity Bank and Family Bank.Politics in Kajiado county is complicated by the fact that those who influence the outcome are not politicians but clan lords.The August election is not expected to be different because clan politics has always takes centre stage in every election period. There are two major clans in Kajiado &mdash; the Orok-Kiteng, who are considered the majority and the minority Odomong&rsquo;i.Orok-Kiteng, normally were referred as black cows, had originally been segregated by the ruling minority Odomong&rsquo;i, the red cows. They are, however, now demanding a share of the county/region leadership.Most of the MPs in the area, since Independence, came from the Odomong'i.Although the Orok-Kiteng have the numbers, against the Odomong'i, the majority of the local indigenous voters feel more secure with the leadership provided by the Odomong&rsquo;i.The entry of two aspirants from the Orok-Kiteng clan in the governor race,has intensified the race considering the other two candidates are from the Odomong&rsquo;i.Daniel Nina and former Interior CS Joseph Lenku from the Ilkisonko section of the Kajiado Maasai are from the Orok-Kiteng and are both seeking the Jubilee Party ticket Jubilee Party.On the other hand, Tarayia Kores and Moses Parantai of the Odomong'i are also fighting for the same ticket.The fifth Jubilee hopeful who wants to clinch the Jubilee ticket.Whoever clinches the Jubilee ticket will square it out with incumbent Governor David Nkedianye, from the Odomong'i.During the JP party nominations, it is expected or feared that Nina and Lenku will split the clan votes and probably gift the ticket to Kores, who comes from the same clan with Nkedianye.If that happens, the red cows will be split between Nkedianye and Kores.Any of them stands a chance to win, depending on how voters from other communities living in the county will cast their ballots.Other than the outsiders' votes, the winner will have to fight for the community votes, and ensure he gets the highest per percentage in both clans. The Kisii, the Luo, the Luhya and the Kamba communities living in Kajiado are likely to vote for the opposition side, while the Kikuyu and the Kalenjin are expected to support Jubilee.It is also worth noting that the Kisii and the Kikuyu are the majority diaspora voters in the region, and their numbers will most definitely influence the outcome of the election.In the last general election, Nkedianye garnered 125,563 votes, beating and Nina who had 95,526 and ran on the URP ticket.Others who tried their shot were Obadiah Kimani of POA and Moses Parantai of DP.At the time, Kores had been disqualified from running because he didn't have university degree certificate.He was poised to have been the best candidate on the TNA ticket to beat Nkedianye.Although Nkedianye won the race, ODM only managed to secure two slots in the county assembly and one MP, Joseph Nkaissery, in Kajiado Central. Nkaissery later resigned when he was appointed Interior CS by President Uhuru Kenyatta. He was replaced by Elijah Memusi of ODM.Out of 25 elected MCAs, TNA managed 23 and that was the beginning of Nkedianye&rsquo;s woes at the helm of the county leadership.Nkedianye now tells the voters to give him a second chance because in the last four years, he lived and worked in &lsquo;hell&rsquo; as Jubilee MCAs frustrated him.At some point after the last general election, some MCAs threatened to reject the county budget because "the governor was not serving their interests".The governor has almost single-handedly managed to recruit more members to ODM, hopping to win more seats in August.Kores and Nina have constantly accused the incumbent of &ldquo;sitting on" the county resources and even returning unspent to the National Treasury.The two say the governor is yet to tarmac a single road since he took office.Interestingly, although most roads in the county are in a poor condition, the county budgets of 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2016-17 show roads were allocated significant amounts of money.In his defence, Nkedianye says the allocation the county receives is not enough to do a complete facelift the roads.&ldquo;The other thing that is still a major hindrance is the flow of money to the county from the National Treasury. We can commit ourselves to undertake many projects but we get frustrated by the national government. We end up looking like liars,&rdquo; Nkedianye says.Whether his explanation will convince the people of Kajiado to reelect him, is not the main challenge. His worry is who he will face from the Jubilee camp.President Uhuru and Deputy President William Ruto have in the past attempted to convince Nkedianye to cross over to the ruling party, but the governor has always remained adamant.He is, however, reported to have asked for a direct ticket if he was to decamp to Jubilee but Uhuru declined.During the Kajiado Central by-election in 2014, Nkedianye led the campaigns for Memusi and retained the seat to ODM.In the recent by-election for Mosiro Ward in Kajiado West constituency, Nkedianye again managed to secure the seat that had been left vacant after the ODM MCA died.There are five subcounties in Kajiado &mdash; Mashuuru, Isinya, Central, South, West and North.Kajiado East Constituency has two subcounties, Isinya and Mashuuru while Kajiado Central, Kajiado South, Kajiado West and Kajiado North constituencies have one each.Currently all the four constituencies except, Kajiado Central are held by Jubilee MPs.
