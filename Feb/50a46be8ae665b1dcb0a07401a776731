Thirdway Alliance Kenya presidential aspirant Ekuru Aukot has dismissed NASA as a retrogressive outfit made of same monkeys hiding in a different forest.Aukot on Saturday said NASA and Jubilee Party are made of failures who cannot protect the interests of the 42 million Kenyans. They are all after power for their selfish interests, he said.NASA brings together Raila Odinga (ODM), Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper), Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula (Ford Kenya) and Musalia Mudavadi (ANC), who have signed a binding political pact that will see them settle on one presidential candidate. Aukot said Thirdway Alliance will not enter into any coalition agreement with any other party, but with the 42 million Kenyans who have had to endure poor leadership for 54 years.&ldquo;We want to take back our country, which is why Thirdway Alliance Kenya is really the only option for the country,&rdquo; he said at a hotel in Mombasa.Aukot said Kenya does not have to only have two sets of leadership, both of which are not keen to take care of the interests of Kenyans. &ldquo;We have gone beyond two horses in the race and we are presenting to Kenyans a camel because of its resilience,&rdquo; Aukot said.Thirdway Alliance leaders toured Kilifi and Mombasa counties last week to popularise the party and sell its agenda to Coast residents.Aukot and deputy party leader Emmanual Nzai said the party will implement the rule of law, one of its five pillars that they say will save Kenya from corruption, insecurity, poverty and impunity. Aukot said Jubilee has failed to emancipate Kenyans from corruption, insecurity, poverty and impunity.
