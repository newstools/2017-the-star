The former chairman of now-defunct New Ford Kenya in Bungoma county, Martin Nyongesa, has announced he will run for Bumula MP.Addressing the press on Saturday in Bungoma town, he said residents approached him because of his excellent development record.&ldquo;I have plunged into the pressure and will contest in the Jubilee Party against the incumbent Boniface Otsiula and the former administrator Cornelius Wamalwa. I&rsquo;m optimistic of emerging the winner during the primaries,&rdquo; Nyongesa said. He said if elected he will provide the best services. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m currently sponsoring the education of more than 40 secondary school students. I have [initiated] many development projects that cost over Sh20 million, yet I&rsquo;m not the area MP. What about if I am elected and have CDF at my disposal? I will do wonders.&rdquo;
