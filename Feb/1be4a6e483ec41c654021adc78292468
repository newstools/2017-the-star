A group of Ford People members have gone to court to reverse a decision to fold up the party and join the Jubilee Party.Edward Onyancha and seven others, in an urgent application filed at the High Court yesterday, want registrar of political parties Lucy Ndung&rsquo;u ordered to rescind a decision dissolving Ford People. They say the merger was unconstitutional.The group faults party chairman Albert Nyaundi for submitting minutes during the merger at Kasarani last year. Onyancha says the decision was not agreed upon by members.Ford People was among 12 other parties that folded up in August last year and joined President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s party. Uhuru will use Jubilee for his reelection in the polls. &ldquo;This is a collective decision which has been fully backed by the party and community leaders across the divide and it will cement unity among our people,&rdquo; Nyaundi said then.But in the suit, Onyancha says the deregistration of Ford People lacked authority of the party and therefore is against the laws stipulated in dissolution of the Parties Act. &ldquo;The signatories to the alleged merger agreement for Ford People to merge with JP lacks any tinge of ostensible authority donated by Ford People under the corporate seal,&rdquo; reads an affidavit sworn by Onyancha.He says the party&rsquo;s certificate of registration is still retained by the officials and the alleged resolution to merge with Jubilee infringes on their rights and offends the Political Parties Act and the Constitution.The group wants the court to compel the Registrar to restore and rectify the membership list of the party. They are further seeking to prohibit Albert Nyaundi, Francis Njoroge, Fredrick Nyaga, Mary Michieka and other former heads from holding themselves as officials.
