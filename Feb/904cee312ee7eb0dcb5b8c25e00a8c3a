Importers have accused the Kenya Revenue Authority of imposing punitive fines on them for goods shipped in under wrong tax tariffs in the taxman's customs system.Association of Importers of Kenya secretary general Jacob Misiko, in a letter to Treasury CS Henry Rotich on Wednesday, claims KRA officials are imposing as much taxes as imposed fines of between 100-150 per cent &ldquo;on any amount of tax increment raised&rdquo; at the customs unit. In the letter, he cites an incident where an investor imported loose cargo under wrong tariff plan which attracts 10 per cent instead of 25 per cent. &ldquo;This client was told by Customs officers to add extra revenue of Sh240,000. He was then fined Sh150,000 on top of the amount of Sh240,000,&rdquo; Misiko says. &ldquo;This is impunity and abuse of the office. We have been notified by importers that the commissioner general gave orders to commissioner of customs on issues regarding uplift of taxes.&rdquo; This, the secretary general says, has created a window of corruption where cluster managers now negotiate with importers on how much to give, failure to which an importer is slapped with a 150 per cent fine on any extra revenue.Misiko said this amounts to double taxation and will push small businessmen out of business.He said customs officers are now hiding behind the East African Community Customs Management Act which gives them powers to fine a client for an offence amount not exceeding $10,000 (Sh1.03 million).&ldquo;This practice is killing businesses and should not be condoned,&rdquo; Misiko said in a letter to National Treasury CS.KRA chief public relations and communication manager Margaret Irungu yesterday said "there have been issues&rdquo;, but the authority will give its position later.&ldquo;We are having a meeting this afternoon on the same. We are also consulting stakeholders,&rdquo; Irungu told the Star on the phone.Importers have also accused KRA of delaying to renew clearing and forwarding agents&rsquo; practicing licenses for 2017, saying it has only renewed 2016 licenses.This has raised concern among clearing and forwarding agents that there is a plot to reduce their number through another vetting process.There are currently about 1,300 clearing and forwarding companies in the country, according to the Kenya International Freight and Warehousing Association, the clearing agents&rsquo; lobby group.
