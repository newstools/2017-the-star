Some Bungoma MCAs on Monday hurled insults, books and papers at two county officials for denying them &ldquo;their&rdquo; Sh300 million and using it instead to build an essential road.The money had been meant for conferences, civic education and foreign travel but was shifted to build the 40km Misikhu-Brigadier road.It was transferred as an austerity measure after the public complained.The Public Administration Committee summoned county secretary Murumba Chuli and Public Administration chief officer David Kibiti for an explanation. The MCAs said the money was transferred without assembly approval.The meeting ended abruptly after MCAs almost engaged county officials in a fistfight. The officials left after lawmakers started shouting and throwing things.Chuli told the committee chaired by MCA Edward Barasa the decision to reduce the budget for foreign travels and conferences was made by the cabinet. &ldquo;Mr chairman, this was an austerity measure passed by the cabinet after a public outcry on foreign travels and conferences. That is why the money was directed to construct the road,&rdquo; he said.The road is a joint venture between the county and the national government.The MCAs accused the executive of disdaining lawmakers and arbitrarily and illegally making decisions.&ldquo;The executive is fond of violating the Public Finance Management Act stipulating such changes and transfers be made through the assembly,&rdquo; Khalaba MCA Majimbo Okumu said.The two officials were also asked why enforcement officers were unevenly deployed, with some wards getting three, while others got 12.Kabuyefwe MCA Joan Lutukai said some wards got a high number of officers, despite small populations. &ldquo;Why did the ward you come from get the highest number?&rdquo; she asked.The chief officer told the assembly the recruitment was done by the Public Service Board and he could not respond on their behalf.This angered the MCAs, who accused Kibiti of being rude.Some MCAs stood up, charging towards him, hurling insults and throwing reading materials.The MCAs could not calm down, despite pleas by the committee chairman. Kibiti was forced to leave, escorted by Jubilee-allied MCAs.Kibiti told journalists the MCAs had behaved badly.In November last year, Governor Kenneth Lusaka said his government would tarmac the road for Sh1.1 billion to create a &ldquo;more conducive environment for business&rdquo;. The road connects Bungoma to Kakamega. and, by extension, Uasin Gishu and Trans Nzoia counties.
