The poor returns in the ongoing final national mass registration of voters come as no surprise, at least to those who follow the exercise closely.&#8232;At the start of the drive mid-this month, the IEBC had planned to bag 6 million new voters by February 14.&#8232; It is now very likely not even half of the initial projection will be realized.&#8232;Looked at properly, the low turnout at the registration centres is a serious indictment of our governance structures, which should be synchronised for maximum cooperation and smooth service delivery.&#8232;Just visit any Huduma Centre in your vicinity today. You will discover there are millions of Kenyans who are lining up, application in hand, looking for the national ID card, an important ingredient in the voter registration exercise.&#8232;During the public debate on the Election Law (Amendments) Bill, 2016, now an Act of Parliament, there was a proposal by the Council of Governors that national mass voter registration should be preceded by mass registration of persons. This eminently reasonable idea was promptly ignored.The argument was that there are millions of young people with no IDs. The aim also was that for people to vote, they need IDs, which could be facilitated through a massive process, covering one month, that would ensure the huge demand for the document from the population was met.&#8232;The argument was it was only at the conclusion of the national mass registration of persons that mass voter registration could begin. There are many Kenyans who are willing and desirous to register to vote, but are bogged down by lack of IDs.&#8232;The next bottleneck came in the same law when we disallowed people with ID waiting cards to register as voters, unlike the case in 2013. The problem is that waiting for a new ID card to be issued takes a minimum of three weeks. Such people ought to be allowed to get their waiting cards and register as voters.&#8232; To know the extent of this problem, we need to note the number of people who have applied for IDs at the same time the voter registration exercise has been going on. Therein lies the problem of poor voter registration: &#8232;It is all about how we synchronise our governance system and what should come first before what.
