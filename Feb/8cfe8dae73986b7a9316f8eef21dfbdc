Two MPs from Baringo yesterdayurged President Uhuru Kenyatta to declare cattle rustling a national disaster and deploy the military to restore order in the region. This follows increased crimes. William Cheptumo (Baringo North) and Sammy Mwaita (Baringo Central) said heavily armed bandits have in the last three days killed several people and stolen thousands of livestock. They said the police on the ground are too few to contain the situation, which they said is getting worse by the day. &ldquo;It is time the KDF soldiers were brought on board in Baringo as the situation has gotten out of hand. The attacks, which are ongoing even with heavy police presence, need to be brought to an end. The officers should be assisted by the military,&rdquo; Cheptumo said. &ldquo;The KDF will assist us in maintaining law and order. We know their mandate, but a time has come for us as a country to utilise the forces.&rdquo; Mwaita called for food support.
