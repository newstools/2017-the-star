Former Chief Justice Willy Mutunga has urged politicians to include marginalised groups in their outfits.He said on Thursday the five big tribes &mdash; Kikuyu, Luo, Luhya, Kamba and Kalenjin &mdash; have neglected marginalised tribes, especially those in Northeastern. Mutunga spoke in Nairobi during the launch of the Horn of Africa Development Initiatives 2017-20 Strategy.&ldquo;Politicians should form a bigger federation comprising leaders from marginalised communities, including the Somali. A bigger federation is very useful,&rdquo; he saidMutunga said this might give Kenyans the peace they need, adding that religion and tribalism will not bring about development and stability in the Horn of Africa. He said he is impressed by the decision of new chief justice David Maraga to build more courts in Marsabit, Garissa and Lodwar, adding that Moyale residents had to walk all the way to Meru to file cases. National Cohesion and Integration Commission chairman Francis ole Kaparo urged Northeastern residents to form peace groups comprised of all clans.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised that people still butcher one another in Northeastern. If we have a group with one member from each clan, we will definitely not fight one another,&rdquo; he said.Northern Kenya is known for interclan skirmishes, which are often brought about by boundary disputes and competition for pasture and water.These have claimed hundreds of lives in the three counties of Marsabit,Wajir and Garrisa. HODI founder Fatuma Ablulkadir said the organisation is working with the leaders and institutions to reconcile residents.
