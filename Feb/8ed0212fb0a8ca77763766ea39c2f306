Budalang&rsquo;i MP Ababu Namwamba&rsquo;s Labour Party of Kenya is today expected to hold its NEC meeting to ratify the party&rsquo;s decision to support President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s reelection.Embattled secretary general David Makali, who was removed by the Namwamba team, has said he will block the move. He said he is still the bona fide secretary general. Makali termed the NEC meeting illegal.In a letter written to NEC members and seen by the Star on February 22, acting secretary general Peter ole Musei said the meeting will be held at Olive Hotel in Hurlingham from 10am. The agenda to endorse Uhuru&rsquo;s candidature is itemised as number three. Other matters to be discussed include reviewing party programmes and preparation for an upcoming women&rsquo;s forum. There has been push and pull between Makali&rsquo;s team and Namwamba&rsquo;s. Makali&rsquo;s faction prefers working with NASA, but Namwamba&rsquo;s has resolved to support Jubilee.This led to the split that led to Makali being replaced as the secretary general. Namwamba is the party leader, while Julia Ojiambo is the chairperson. Makali yesterday said Namwamba&rsquo;s team is trying to pave way to join the Jubilee Party, but he will block the move by a court order.Speaking to the Star on the phone yesterday, LPK communication secretary Eric Masanza said only Jubilee Party has a presidential candidate and decisions have to be made. &ldquo;As we speak now, NASA has no presidential candidate. People should stop being emotional because decisions have to be made at the end of the day,&rdquo; he said. Masanza said Makali is becoming hypocritical, adding that the decision to replace him a secretary general and pick a particular presidential candidate had been reached a long time ago during a retreat in Elementaita, which Makali attended.
