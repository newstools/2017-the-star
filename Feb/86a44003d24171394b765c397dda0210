The High Court has stopped the prosecution of political analyst Mutahi Ngunyi over hate speech and ethnic contempt, as there was no room to pursue alternative conciliation.In a ruling yesterday, Justice Joseph Onguto said the trial at the chief magistrate&rsquo;s court "is an abuse of the criminal justice system&rdquo;.He said the National Cohesion and Integration Commission was in a hurry to prosecute Ngunyi without giving the petitioner room to pursue the alternative window of conciliation. He said this is a core objective for the creation of the commission.Ngunyi was summoned to record a statement over a post on Twitter on August 19, 2015, in which he described Luos as &ldquo;poverty-stricken&rdquo;.The criminal case arising from Ngunyi&rsquo;s remarks has been ongoing, despite him offering a public apology and a white goat to appease his accusers.LSK former chief executive Apollo Mboya filed the complaint with the NCIC and has already given his testimony in the lower court as the first witness in the case.The prosecution was allowed to amend the charges against Ngunyi on Wednesday last week, after the trial court declined to bar the proposed amendment. But the matter will now be closed, unless the DPP appeals.Ngunyi&rsquo;s lawyer Jennifer Shamalla had argued that the prosecution should not have began before the alleged offensive words he was accused of tweeting were put in context.She also faulted the investigations, saying they violated Ngunyi&rsquo;s rights.Shamalla said Ngunyi had written to the NCIC to notify them of his intended conciliation, but it was dismissed.She said a similar reprieve had been extended to former minister Chirau Ali Mwakwere, whose case was dropped after he made a public apology.
