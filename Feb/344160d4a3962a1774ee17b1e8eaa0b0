Uchumi supermarket is counting on government support and a planned revival plan to remain in business, even as losses continue to maul the retailer.The publicly listed firm yesterday announced an after-tax loss of Sh2.8 billion in the full-year ending June 30, 2016, a reduction in the group's losses by 17 per cent from Sh3.4 billion recorded in 2015.The company&rsquo;s board yesterday attributed the results to the closure of non-performing branches in Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya, and supply chain challenges.&ldquo;The group lost control of the subsidiaries in Uganda and Tanzania in October 2015. The short-term effect to June 2016 was the decline in revenues,&rdquo; the retailer said in its consolidated income statement.The retail chain&rsquo;s net sales declined to Sh6.4 billion from Sh12.9 billion in 2015, with the cost of goods sold falling by close to 50 per cent to close at Sh5.5 billion from Sh10.8 billion a year earlier.The group&rsquo;s operating expenses, however, reduced to Sh3.3billion from Sh4.8 billion, largely due to the closure of six outlets in Kenya, which left 253 employees jobless.The supermarket&rsquo;s board and management on Monday said they are focusing on a turnaround strategy which includes adoption of a franchising model, funding through shareholder loan, ICT improvement and supplier support. The retailer is also searching for an investor.&ldquo;Discussions are ongoing with several potential partners and the board is hopeful that the discussions will be concluded in 2017,&rdquo; the statement by chairperson Catherine Ngahu and CEO Julius Kipng&rsquo;etich stated. In a separate statement, Kipng&rsquo;etich said the retailer is firmly on the road to recovery after recording an improved financial position. &ldquo;We have had to make tough decisions in order to ensure the continued survival and growth of the brand. We may not be out of the woods yet, but we can certainly expect to start to see positive results now as we work to revamp the brand,&rdquo; he said.Uchumi gave its revival plans to the Cabinet and the government agreed to inject Sh1.8 billion to enable the company return to profitability.Some Sh1.2 billion will pay Uchumi&rsquo;s operating expenses, while Sh600 million will settle subsidiaries&rsquo; liabilities. The turnaround plan is expected to take between six months and two-and-a half years.The first phase of the strategy seeks to stabilise the business through stringent financial management, closure of non-viable outlets, strategic opening of stores, rationalisation and competency assessment of staff.It will also involve refurbishment of key branches to increase footfall, improve relations with suppliers and enhance customer service. Plans to venture into franchising are in place, and the company hopes this will increase sales, as risks will be transferred to the management of new outlets.The model will be implemented by setting up smaller outlets (Uchumi Express and Uchumi Mini) through which Uchumi Supermarket will earn royalties of approximately four per cent of the sales.In line with the strategy, Uchumi launched its first franchise pilot shop &ndash; Uchumi Express &ndash; in Mwiki, Kasarani, in Nairobi. It plans to launch 300 such outlets over the next three years.
