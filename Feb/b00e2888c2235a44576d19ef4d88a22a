Siaya MCAs on Wednesday threatened to destabilise Dominion Farms' operations as punishment for allegedly being called 'thugs' by CEO Calvin Burgess.They turned the heat on Burgess for deviating from the agreement he reached with the community at the start of the venture.The legislators accused the investor of reneging on an earlier agreement that he would build schools, hospitals and roads.This, according to the MCAs, was to be part of Dominion's social contribution for being allowed to use the swamp."Ten years down the line, Burgess has done nothing apart from joining political hecklers in the country," Peter Muhula, West Alego MCA, said.The MCAs asked concerned state authorities to punish the firm for disposing harmful chemicals into water bodies at the area.Burgess, in a press conference last week, accused Raila and some of his allies of extortion.The investor said that in the event of failure to meet the politicians' demands, he is threatened with violence and eviction.But in the session, the infuriated MCAs said the CEO's allegations amount to witch-hunt, further accusing Jubilee Party of scheming to tarnish Raila's name. Sylvester Madialo of Usonga ward said: "Raila is beyond kitchen politics and should not be subjected to react on anything about Dominion. He is above that," Leonard Oriaro of Central Alego ward, who was mentioned among the four MCAs referred to as thugs, said he is fully prepared to counter the allegations."I have contacted my lawyers to analyse the report and advise me on how I can personally deal with Burgess," Oriaro said.He further refuted the Dominion CEO's assertions that Raila imposed him on the people of Central Alego ward to fight the project."I was elected on a National Vision Party ticket and not ODM," Oriaro said, adding that they will not rest until the matter is resolved.Muhula said they want a probe on how Burgess was allowed to operate in the country."We feel he was granted permission to work in the country without due process and that is why he does not respect the laws in Kenya," he said."He does not recognise institutions that make laws as well as the laws themselves," Muhula said. Muhula said these have adverse environmental effects exhibited through deaths of livestock as well as contamination of water resources.MCAs Ombewa Gare and Elisha Odhiambo told Duale to take the CEO to Garissa, saying the area needed more investors than Siaya.Speaker George Okode directed the assembly committee on implementation to summon Burgess to explain his allegations.Okode said: "To maintain the cordial relationship between Kenya and the US, a copy of the report be issued to the US embassy and the FBI,"He said that the DPP, EACC and COTU be served with the report for appropriate actions to be taken against those named.Read: Come clean on Dominion Farms extortion saga, Jubilee tells RailaAlso read: Siaya leaders defend Raila against 'conman' Dominion CEO over bribery claims
