The Teachers Service Commission will promote 100,000 tutors from Job Group G to H from July, it says.CEO Nancy Macharia said this is in line with the implementation of the CBA signed last year between the commission and teachers' unions Knut and Kuppet.She said 6,000 will be promoted from Job Group L to M, while 4,000 will be moved from M to N.The promotions, Macharia said, will be conducted using the performance contracts and appraisals that have helped the commission to better vet teachers.She said the contracts that teachers signed early last year have started paying off and expressed optimism that they will help improve academic performance.&ldquo;Teachers who work hard will be appreciated as their efforts will be recognised through the appraisal system,&rdquo; Macharia said.The CEO said there is a need to review the strategies used in teaching to revert the sharp decline of performance experienced last year.&ldquo;Last year&rsquo;s performance raised issues on what exactly is going on in the classrooms and what went wrong,&rdquo; she added.It is unfortunate, Macharia said, that many candidates scored below average marks and were locked out of universities.She urged stakeholders, including parents, to work together to ensure academic performance is enhanced.Macharia urged teachers to complete their syllabuses in time to give them more time to prepare for national examinations.She questioned what could have gone wrong if teachers taught their lessons and students attended normal classes."We need to all ask ourselves how we contributed to the low performance last year and what should be done to ensure it does not recur,&rdquo; Macharia said.She spoke at Kigumo Bendera High School, Murang'a, during the constituency&rsquo;s Education Day.Area MP Jamleck Kamau disbursed Sh23 million bursaries.
