Motorists have faulted the Energy Regulatory Commission&rsquo;s monthly pump prices accusing the regulator of exploiting Kenyans, as fuel prices went up by between Sh3.75 and Sh5.03 a litre this week.Through the Motorist Association of Kenya, the motorists yesterday termed the February-March huge margin &ldquo;uncalled-for&rdquo;, discrediting the price control policy which came into place in 2005.MAK chairman Peter Murima said the agitation to have fuel price controls to make the market predictable for stable economy is &ldquo;no more&rdquo;.&ldquo;The claim by the Energy Regulatory Commission boss that fuel price in Kenya are controlled by supply and demand is misleading. The market is no longer a free after the 2010 Energy Act. This explains probably why multinationals still call the shots seven years later,&rdquo; Murima said.He said the ERC failed to give Kenyans the full benefit of low oil prices when global crude oil prices went below $50 (Sh5,182 )per barrel.&ldquo;The regulator gave reasons of not being able to drop prices further citing reasons that Kenya buy refined products. Same cannot have changed now when world crude change marginally and are still too low,&rdquo; he said.MAK said the Open Tender System, used to import fuel products, is manipulated by multinationals who have locked out local independent oil dealers.The cost of basic goods and services is expected to go up after the increase in fuel prices for the next month ending March 14.Under the reviewed prices announced on Tuesday, Diesel &ndash; largely used in transportation, farming and manufacturing &ndash; rose by the highest margin of Sh5.03 per litre.Motorists are now paying Sh4.26 more for a litre of petrol while poor households who use kerosene for cooking and lighting are parting with Sh3.75 more for every litre.A litre of petrol in Nairobi now costs Sh100.27 up from Sh96.0. Diesel and Kerosene costs Sh89.26 and Sh67.19 per litre respectively.ERC blamed the rise on higher global oil prices and depreciation in value of the shilling against the dollar.MAK yesterday, however, questioned why the Kipevu storage facility is not able to hold huge stocks to enable at least a three months fuel review.Average cost of imported petrol increased by 8.45 per cent to $575.06 per tonne in January from $530.24 in December, the ERC said. Diesel increased by 12.07 per cent from $446.84 per tonne to $500.78, while Kerosene increased by 7.44 per cent from $487.91 per tonne to $524.20 between December and January.&ldquo;The applicable pump prices have been impacted, primarily so because the petroleum cargoes used in this month&rsquo;s computation were procured in December 2016 and January 2017. It takes between 30 and 45 days between order placement and Cargo delivery,&rdquo; said ERC acting director general Pavel Oimeke on Tuesday.Oimeke said some of the issues he would be focusing on in his new position include the provision of cheaper energy and establishment of regional ERC offices in the 47 counties.
