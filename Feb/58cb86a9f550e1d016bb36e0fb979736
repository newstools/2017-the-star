I&rsquo;m reading what appears to be written by Eric on my Twitter feed. It&rsquo;s on some random site that dwells on people&rsquo;s sexual exploits, and he&rsquo;s using the handle @KevBosire. I&rsquo;m unsure if he wrote this himself or told someone about us. But the attention to every minute detail makes me think it&rsquo;s Eric for sure. He&rsquo;s writing about our first BDSM experience. I continue reading:She opened the door&hellip; Wahala. She was in a red corset. I was rooted to the ground. She quickly pulled me in before someone passed by and saw her. Bruh, I get into the house and the place looks like a terrorist interrogation centre. My mouth felt dry, like I&rsquo;m trying to chew sawdust. This chick probably used three month&rsquo;s salary to get these things. Sijui handcuffs, blindfolds&hellip; She gave me a hug; it felt like she was wearing armor, like a character from Spartacus. We started kissing. She started undressing me. &ldquo;Wahhh babe. Where did you get all this stuff?&rdquo; I asked. No reply. By that time I should&rsquo;ve known this bitch was about to get crazy but I was naively relaxed. I was in my boxers, kissing, kissing&hellip; I tried to get that corset off but there were laces everywhere like a footballer&rsquo;s boot. Down and over like Thika Superhighway. I gave up. She got down on her knees and blew my mind as she eh, played jazz on the horn section. I remember thinking to myself&hellip; This BDSM s**t is not so bad after all. Then she got the blindfolds, put them on me and told me to lie on the bed, facing down. I did it. I was still calm and relaxed. She took the cuffs and locked each of my hands to the bed stands. She tied each of my legs to the other end of the bed with leather straps. So there I was, naked, butt exposed and blind. I hear her walking around the house. Long silence. What now? The sound came first then as I was trying to figure out what the hell that was, the pain started to register. I&rsquo;d been whipped fam, on my butt, so hard, acha tu. Then before I could react to that first one, another one came in landing almost the same spot as the first one did. A weird sound involuntarily left my mouth. &ldquo;Aaah&hellip; wewe Kabu!!!&rdquo;&ldquo;What?&rdquo; she asked. ATI WHAT? This bitch asked me what fam. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s freaking painful,&rdquo; I quickly respond. Mistake bruh... Another lashing comes in. &ldquo;Who gave you permission to curse here?&rdquo; she shrieks.Aiyaiyai. This chick has lost it.I laugh despite myself. Eric is explaining exactly what transpired that night but I had never heard it from his perspective. It&rsquo;s interesting to read what was actually going through his mind as I &ldquo;punished&rdquo; him for being a bad, bad boy. I feel myself getting aroused as I keep reading.Lash after lash rains down on me. &ldquo;You want this to stop?&rdquo; she asks. I have never heard her sound like this. It&rsquo;s like she&rsquo;s possessed. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I say. &ldquo;Just stop,&rdquo; I plead. Another mistake. Another lash. She is not messing around. There is a way one&rsquo;s body prepares itself for pain and that can only happen when you can at least see what&rsquo;s coming. I&rsquo;m blindfolded. I don&rsquo;t know when the whip is coming, so I&rsquo;m just lying there with constantly clenched buttocks. I start weighing my options. Being stern is only going to get her madder. I cross that off. I can&rsquo;t scream for help. People will rush here and find me like this. Mashida tu. I have to obey and go with the flow. &ldquo;Who am I?&rdquo; she is asking.&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Answering a question with a question earns me a lash. And I didn&rsquo;t know this chick is this strong; it was like she was lifting up the whip to Mars and bringing it down on me.
