Jubilee leadership is under fire for sidelining the Kamba community and failing to honour promises made after parties dissolved to join it.Former Kibwezi MP Kalembe Ndile has said the presidency is only interested in working with Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka as opposed to the entire Kamba community."President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto have a notion that Kalonzo controls 1 million Kamba votes and this must stop," he told the Star on Monday.He claimed Jubilee's top leadership is ready to channel all their resources to ensure Kalonzo and opposition leader Raila Odinga do not stay in one alliance."They want Kalonzo to go it alone like it happened in 2007 so that Raila can lose the August 8 polls," Ndile said.More on this: Jubilee seeks Kalonzo dealAlso read: I will not betray Kenyans by moving to Jubilee - Kalonzo"Jubilee does not respect us Kambas who joined the new party. They actually don't value our capacity," he added.He said the community was not involved in planning Uhuru and Ruto's tour of Ukambani on Tuesday.He said those around Uhuru were coming up with activities and dictating them on what party officials should do."We are not naive or small children for someone to come and dictate to us what to do. We are in politics for reasons and must be involves in the stages. We want to win the election," Ndile said.He noted that Jubilee will only win the Kamba vote if it took seriously campaigns in the region and stopped relying on brokers to access residents."I don't think Jubilee is serious in winning Ukambani seats. I challenge them to work with us in the grassroots," he said.Uhuru will be holding Jubilee rallies and a roadshow from Mtito Andei and Mlolongo on Wednesday.In May last year, speculation was high that Kalonzo would be joining Jubilee after Uhuru hosted Ukambani leaders including Wiper officials in State House, Nairobi.But Wiper chair David Musila quickly dismissed the claims, saying they were made to discredit Kalonzo.Read: Meetings with Uhuru do not mean Kalonzo will join Jubilee - MusilaAlso read: MPs who ditched Wiper for Jubilee will lose, says Kalonzo
