CAF mandarins are expected in the country today to start inspections on match venues that will go a long way to determine whether Kenya will host next year&rsquo;s African Nations Championships.During the meeting held over the weekend at Moi, Kasarani and chaired by FKF President Nick Mwendwa, the LOC discussed a wide range of issues touching on the country&rsquo;s level of preparedness and the upcoming Caf Inspection visit scheduled to take place between today and Friday. &ldquo;It is vital to point out that the outcome of the inspection will determine further our capability and capacity to successfully host CHAN 2018 in Kenya. As the host nation, we want to remove any doubts during the inspection and assure Caf and Africa as a whole that Kenya will be ready to host the 2018 CHAN,&rdquo; explained Mwendwa.The reason for this critical inspection visit is to determine the progress of Kenya&rsquo;s readiness in hosting the CHAN 2018 tournament.This is a high level follow up to two visits already done in 2016. The inspection will be on the various stadia that will be hosting the competition, training grounds, hospitals and hotels that will accommodate CAF delegations, officials and the participating teams.
