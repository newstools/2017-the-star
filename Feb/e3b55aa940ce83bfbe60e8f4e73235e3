Unfortunately, the group has been insisting on receiving 20 per cent of the payments before approving, to the chagrin of the accounts team.

They are putting up a fence with razor wire around their Pangani HQ to prevent attacks from the rear. The new wire separates the Thika Superhighway and Jubilee Headquarters.

A friend to a Governor from western was overheard laughing at his boss, saying that he is the only one who has constructed outside the town. He said the governor had assumed the electorate in his constituency would not discover the flats a few kilometers from the CBD towards Athi River.
