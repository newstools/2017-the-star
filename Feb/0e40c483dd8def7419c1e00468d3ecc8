After being granted state security, the petitioner seeking Auditor General Edward Ouko's removal from office appeared before MPs on Tuesday to submit his evidence.Emmanuel Mwagambo has accused Ouko of violating the constitution by failing to submit reports to the President and Parliament.Mwagambo claims the auditor has failed to prevent massive wastage of public funds as well as deal with nepotism in recruitment of staff at his office.He also wants Ouko held accountable for violation of procurement laws, in what is yet another attempt to kick the Auditor General out.The petitioner appeared before the National Assembly Finance committee.Read: DPP clears Auditor General Edward Ouko over abuse of office claimsMwagambo wrote to the committee last Thursday saying he would only present himself to defend his petition if granted security.He cited fear for his life saying unknown people had been threatening him since he filed the petition.Mwagambo also requested that proceedings be held behind closed doors and asked to be allowed to submit a written memorandum.National Assembly clerk Michael Sialaiwrote to IG Joseph Boinnet on Friday asking him to provide Mwagambo and his family with security to facilitate his appearance before the committee.But the committee declined to grant the closed door session, MPs saying this would be determined on a case-by-case basis, following the petitioner's appearance and requests.Read: Fresh plot to remove Auditor OukoAlso read: Arrest Auditor General Ouko and face countrywide demos, Raila tells stateParliamentary Standing Orders allow a witness appearing before a plenary, or its committees sitting as a quasi-judicial court, to request a private session if the subject is highly sensitive and may jeopardise their security.Mwangambo has submitted his petition and evidence to Parliament but the committee has the mandate to interrogate if the grounds cited meet the requisite threshold for Ouko's removal from office.Ouko will also face the committee on Tuesday afternoon to respond to the allegations raised.If the committee is satisfied that the grounds meet the merit level, it will compile a report recommending that Parliament compels the President to form a tribunal to probe the auditor.Ouko, whose term ends in 2019, will be required to step aside to pave way for investigations into the alleged crimes once a tribunal is set up.Mwagambo has come under immense scrutiny with some claiming that he could be a hatchet man working at the whims of shadowy individuals to push for Ouko's sacking.Past bids to remove the Auditor have failed; he has been accused by Jubilee leaders of leaking audit queries to Opposition leaders for political mileage.Read: Auditor General Edward Ouko should resign over shoddy reports - MP Njenga
