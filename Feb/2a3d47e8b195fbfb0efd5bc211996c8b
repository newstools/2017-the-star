Three United Nations human rights experts have criticised the government for the increased attacks on civil society.UN Special Rapporteurs Maina Kiai, David Kaye and Michel Forst want the government to cease its systematic crackdown on civil society groups.&ldquo;It appears that there is a systematic and deliberate pattern to crack down on civil society groups which challenge governmental policies, educate voters, investigate human rights abuses and uncover corruption,&rdquo; they said in a statement yesterday.The three said attempts to shut down the debate taking place in the civic space threatens to irreparably taint the legitimacy of the upcoming elections.Last month, the Interior ministry called for the closure of NGOs deemed to be &lsquo;not properly licensed&rsquo; and were a threat to national security.
