Detectives are probing fresh allegations against an Italian investor and close ally of extradited drug barons Baktash Akasha and his brother Ibrahim.Paolo Basta risks being deported and charged for criminal offences allegedly committed in Mombasa. He runs several companies in Mombasa and Kilifi. Basta is suspected to have played a role in the arrest and extradition of Baktash, Ibrahim and two foreigners - Vijaygiri Goswami (Indian) and Gulam Hussein (Pakistani). The Star exclusively obtained sworn affidavits by a foreigner who accuses Basta of threatening him, and a witness. Both affidavits were sworn on November 9, 2016 by a Nairobi lawyer. Investigations conducted by the Star indicate the drama occurred on December 16, 2015 at 1pm in Nyali at a house owned by Baktash near Voyager Hotel. The witness said that upon reaching Akasha&rsquo;s apartment in Nyali, his employer entered the villa and stayed for about 30 minutes.&ldquo;I saw my employer emerge from the villa accompanied by another man who was holding a gun in his right hand. He hid it,&rdquo; the statement read. The foreigner is quoted as saying, &ldquo;Paolo claimed I owed him a long-standing debt of Sh400,000 and demanded immediate payment, while Baktash demanded a surcharge of Sh1.1 million disturbance fee for delayed payment.&rdquo; Basta has been linked to tax evasion syndicates at the Port of Mombasa. The Star is also in possession of a bill of lading for imports that is being investigated by KRA officials. KRA port operations manager Joseph Kaguru said it is investigating. The foreigner said he had no money with him, but Ibrahim insisted he pay before leaving and drew his pistol and pointed at him. They drove to his residence to collect the chequebook and the foreigner made the payment at gunpoint. The foreigner will meet DCI director Ndegwa Muhoro this week over the incident. Basta denied the allegation and threatened to sue.
