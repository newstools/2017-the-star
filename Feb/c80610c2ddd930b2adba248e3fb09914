Elders in Elgeyo Marakwet have withdrawn from talks to have the two main communities share top seats.The Kalenjin Elders Council, popularly known as the Kotaab Myot, said it will allow the Marakwets and Keiyos to elect leaders of their choice for governor, senator and woman representative.The negotiations were halted after the elders failed to agree with a rival elders group known as the Kokwetab Keiyo Elders Foundation, whose patron is former powerful minister Nicholas Biwott.Governor Alex Tolgos and Senator Kipchumba Murkomen are both Marakwets.Some of the elders have been agitating to have one of the two positions handed to the Keiyos for harmonious co-existence.County officials of the Kalenjin Elders Council, led by Corporal (Rtd) Stephen Kimwetich, retired civil servant Michael Maina and Andrew Chemweno said negotiated democracy is irrelevant. &ldquo;We tried our best to sell this agenda but it has backfired and proved completely unsellable,&rdquo; said Maina, a former Keiyo Marakwet County Council clerk.Kimwetich, a retired Air Force officer, said elders don&rsquo;t mind if all those elected will be from one community, as long as they are from the region and are committed to serving the county. &ldquo;The idea of sharing jobs would have been the best formula but unfortunately, some politicians and aspirants are against the idea, that is why we were frustrated,&rdquo; he said.
