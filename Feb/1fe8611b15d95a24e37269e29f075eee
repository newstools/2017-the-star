The 2016 Kenya Basketball Federation Division Two season play-offs recess will hold-up longer before competition resume.This is after World Hope Club&rsquo;s application to the Sports Disputes Tribunal to be allowed 10 days to file a second witness statement. The petition will be heard on February 28.World Hope, who did not qualify for the second tier division play-offs, allege they were maliciously locked out of the competition to vie for promotion slot to the Premier League. The club is protesting their being denied chances to rightfully vie for and earn points.The club told the Tribunal that they never received fixtures for May 22, 2016 pitting them against Baraka Xtreme in the first instance. The second occurrence involves Mt. Kenya University (Thika), who were turned away from the field owing to non-payment of league fees.World Hope counsel, Samuel Muthomi submitted that according to KBF&rsquo;s rules, forfeiture is ambiguous and the only narrative in this regard is: &ldquo;A team gets one point for forfeiting their leagues fixture,&rdquo; Muthomi told the court.He added Fiba&rsquo;s definition of forfeiture is: &ldquo;When a team is not in attendance, or abandoned the game mid-way, and in this case the side that has not honored their tie get zero points.&rdquo;While giving the hearing date, the Sports Disputes Tribunal chairman John Ohaga raised concern that the play-offs will take long to conclude, hence affecting the federation&rsquo;s schedule of the 2017 season.&ldquo;I am concerned that you are dragging this matter too long and you know we can&rsquo;t suspend the play-offs indefinitely. Take the 10 days to put in all you want ton because we must expedite and resolve this matter as soon as possible,&rdquo; noted Ohaga, a Kenya Harlequins Rugby Football Club legend.Elsewhere, Chess Kenya officials Githinji Hinga (president) and his secretary general Joseph Atwoli didn&rsquo;t show up during the scrutiny of the member registers from both CK and the John Mukabi-led faction. The Tribunal consequently tasked Mukabi and his team to harmonize the two lists of players who had fully paid membership levies by January 31 within seven days. The matter will come up for mention next Tuesday February 21 at the Tribunal.
