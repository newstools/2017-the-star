Kenya Power Board chairman Kenneth Marende will today declare his political stand.This comes amid speculation that he was considering working with ODM leader Raila Odinga. Marende, who is eyeing a political seat, is also expected to resign from his position as a February 8 deadline looms.The Public Service Code of Conduct bars public officers from seeking political positions while in service. Marende, who accompanied Raila to visit ailing former Maragoli MP Joseph Otiende at the Avenue Hospital, Kisumu, did not comment on his next move.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m incapable of being a political catch,&rdquo; the former National Assembly speaker said. However, sources familiar with his plan reveal he might rejoin the party.Marende said they are good friends with Raila. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a very solid person, with immense gravitas. I&rsquo;ll be giving my statements on where I stand politically tomorrow [today],&rdquo; he said.In 2015, he ditched ODM for the United Democratic Party. UDP was founded by former Lugari MP Cyrus Jirongo and the late Minister Soita Shitanda. The party was being packaged as the vehicle to be used by the Luhya community at this year&rsquo;s election.Marende said the community had supported Raila overwhelmingly in the last two presidential elections and ended up in the political cold. He asked members of the Luhya community to quit ODM and work with the government. Later, President Uhuru Kenyatta appointed him to his current position.
