A human rights activist wants police to make public the results of investigations into the killing of three workers in a Garissa hotel. The men, two of them brothers, were bludgeoned to death as they slept on Thursday last week at 3am. They were found on a blood-soaked mattress with their phones in their hands, and police said they could have been making frantic calls. It is not clear how the killers gained access to the hotel. The bodies were examined by a doctor and released to their families for burial in accordance with Islamic rites. Northern Forum for Democracy coordinator Khalif Abdi yesterday said the police should provide details of the circumstances surrounding the murder of the guard and two waiters. He said police have the sole responsibility to protect lives and they “must arrest the culprits behind the heinous attack”. “We don’t want to speculate on the murder, but the investigative agencies must do their work properly and bring to book all those behind the killings,” he told journalists in Garissa town. “Such killings at a time we are going for a general election might create unnecessary anxiety and the earlier they are resolved, the better for all of us.” Garissa police boss Aaron Moriasi said police are investigating but are yet to make any arrests. “We are doing everything within our powers, but I want to urge Garissa residents to remain calm and stop speculation on the incident,” he said. County commissioner James Kianda also urged the public to stop speculation and give the investigating agencies time to do their job.
