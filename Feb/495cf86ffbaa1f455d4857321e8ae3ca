Malindi Wiper hopefuls have launched aggressive campaigns to win all seats in the constituency, which is perceived to be an ODM zone.The aspirants defected from ODM, citing frustrations. They now say they are on a mission to disabuse Kenyans of the notion that Malindi supports ODM. In 2013, ODM won all seats in the constituency.The Wiper team has one MP aspirant Rashid Odhiambo and 13 aspiring MCAs. Odhiambo was cleared by the party last week and has hit the ground running to woo residents. He expressed confidence about winning.On Thursday, he urged NASA principals not to zone the county. Odhiambo said they are against joint NASA nominations in Malindi, adding that each party has its own members and supporters. &ldquo;Let the people decide who becomes their leader in a democratic manner,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Malindi is no longer an ODM zone. We want new things. Let each party go to the polls.&rdquo;Odhiambo said if elected, he will bring change. He said only leaders who live and invest in the constituency can initiate development projects. The hopeful said previous leaders have failed to tackle problems, inflicting suffering on residents.No child will be sent home because of school arrears if he is elected, he said.&ldquo;Malindi is not poor. It has so many resources, including the Ocean, salt, rocks, sisal and maize. It&rsquo;s an irony that people are dying of hunger,&rdquo; he said. Incumbent Willy Mtengo and woman MP Aisha Jumwa are seeking the ODM ticket.
