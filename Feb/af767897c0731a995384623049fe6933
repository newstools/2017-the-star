Tatu City residents in Ruiru were yesterday morning treated to a potential meat feast after a speeding car rammed into a herd, killing nine cows.The driver was heading to Ruiru from Kiambu town at around 5am. It took the intervention of officers from Ruiru police station to restrain the villagers from slaughtering the cows.Resident James King&rsquo;ori said, &ldquo;We cannot let this meat go to waste. We have to take it home for food and sell some to those who are still rolling in their beds. I wonder why the police are restraining us from taking the free meat.&rdquo; The vehicle was damaged and the driver sustained minor injuries. He was treated at a hospital in Kiambu town before being released.Witness Mathew Gicuhi said the cows abruptly crossed the road.&ldquo;The driver of the Toyota Fielder was speeding and it seems he didn&rsquo;t notice the cows were crossing.&rdquo; The accident caused a traffic snarl-up for hours until the police cleared the animals from the road.Residents said the herders had themselves to blame for taking their cows to graze in the town.They said herders have been taking their animals to graze in their farms at night. &ldquo;We hope the authorities will rein in on these herders grazing by the roadside to avert more accidents,&rdquo; King&rsquo;ori said. Traffic commander Isaac Thuranira said a team of health and environmental experts will meet to discuss how to dispose the animals. He ruled out slaughtering them for sale.Thuranira issued a stern warning to herders who have invaded the area, saying those who graze on residents&rsquo; farms will be arrested and charged with trespass.&ldquo;Grazing by the roadside endangers motorists. The herders must abide by the law and ensure they move their herds away from road reserves,&rdquo; he said.
