Turkana MPs have accused Governor Josphat Nanok of stage managing the recent shooting at ODM leader Raila Odinga's rally in Lokichar.Raila escaped unhurt when more than 15 gunmen disrupted his meeting with ODM delegates in Katilie ward on Friday.Men began firing from the back at around 1.30pm, party spokesperson Dennis Onyango told the Star.But Senator John Munyes said on Monday that Nanok staged the attack to gain sympathy votes after realising Turkana is a Jubilee stronghold."We don't condone violence and Nanok should desist from engaging in drama for sympathy votes. Raila is a national leader, is welcome to Turkana anytime and there was no plot of his assassination," Munyes said.He termed the assassination claims as exaggerated, saying they were meant to tarnish the name of "peaceful Turkana people".[VIDEO] Turkana youths wash roads ahead of Raila cultural fete addressRead: Raila rally chaos &lsquo;ploy by Jubilee to assassinate him'The MPs questioned why opposition leaders, including Raila and Nanok, have not written statements with police.They accused Nanok of embarking on violent campaign similar to those in 2013 to intimidate other leaders.ODM condemned the attack saying "Kenya is a democracy and all Kenyans have a right to assemble and rally".&ldquo;The actions of the hired youth show that the Jubilee government is not interested in the welfare of Kenyans,&rdquo; said secretary general Agnes Zani.
