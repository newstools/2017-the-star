Doctors yesterday suffered a setback after it emerged the disputed 2013 CBA they want implemented is only a &ldquo;template document.&rdquo;Former Public Health and Sanitation PS Mark Bor, who appended his signature on it on behalf of the ministry, told a joint parliamentary committee the preliminary document was not for registration.National Assembly joint committees on Health and Labour also realised that Bor signed the document unlawfully on June 27, 2013, yet his term at the ministry ended following an executive order after the Jubilee administration took power.Bor served between 2008 and 2013 in the ministry at a time when it had been split into two &ndash; the Medical Services and Public Health and Sanitation.The committee co-chaired by David Were (Labour) and Rachael Nyamai (Health) put Bor to task to reveal who authorised him to sign the document.The former PS could, however, not disclose if he acted through instruction from the substantive top ministry officials.The two ministries had been merged into Health ministry under James Macharia as the CS and PS Fred Sigor.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true I was not the PS at the point of signing the document, but it was not the final CBA to be registered. There were demands we agreed and some did not agree with doctors&rsquo; union officials during our negotiations as a ministry,&rdquo; Bor said.He defended his move to sign the document on grounds the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacist and Dentists&rsquo; Union officials led by former secretary general Sultan Matendechere kept &ldquo;shifting positions on their demands.&rdquo;Bor also said he acted on the document for his successors at the ministry to own it, engage the union in coming up with a final CBA for registration and help address medics plights.Seven doctors&rsquo; union officials led by secretary general Ouma Oluga were present in the meeting. They were caught by surprise.The Oluga-led team, during their submission to the committee before Bor, admitted the CBA is yet to be registered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s public knowledge the CBA was not registered because the ministry was frustrating the registration, despite the court ruling to have it registered by January 6 this year. The frustration led to industrial action we are in,&rdquo; Oluga said.
