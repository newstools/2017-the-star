The Association of Kenyans in the Diaspora has threatened to sue the IEBC for contempt of court.Chairman Shem Ochuodho (pictured) yesterday told the Star the electoral body failed to implement a Supreme Court order on how diaspora voting should be done. The IEBC yesterday embarked on a two-week diaspora voter listing drive. &ldquo;The court directed the commission to ensure proper infrastructure and facilitation of the voting process is put in place, a directive the commission has thrown over the fence,&rdquo; he said.Ochuodho said the commission also failed to file a report on infrastructure it put in place to support the process. &ldquo;The commission is hiding under Chapter 82 of the Constitution to arm-twist us, but Chapter 83 clearly defines what it has to do,&rdquo; he said.Ochuodho said they are also seeking court&rsquo;s intervention to compel the IEBC to register Kenyans living in other countries apart from those in the East African region.&ldquo;We have about 3 million Kenyans living in the diaspora. We targeted at least one million to participate at the August 8 poll but so far what the IEBC has done is contrary to what the diaspora family expected,&rdquo; he said.Ochuodho accused the electoral agency of trashing their recommendations and failing to prioritise countries with the majority of Kenyans. &ldquo;Our recommendations were backed up by the Foreign Affairs ministry, but the IEBC chose to rubbish them. This clearly shows that about 2 million potential voters will not register,&rdquo; he said.
