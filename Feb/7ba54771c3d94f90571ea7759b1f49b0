Pangolins are the most trafficked mammal, despite the highest levels of protection given.During World Pangolin Day celebrations on Saturday, conservationists warned the population is severely dwindling because of the growing demand for their scales. International Fund for Animal Welfare campaigns officer Mark Hofberg said in a statement that pangolins are falling prey to the ultimate predator - humans.&ldquo;The rate at which pangolins are being poached is unprecedented and unsustainable. The value we place on pangolins should be for their role in the wild, not as a status symbol. We have won some hard fought victories to protect this exotic species, but more needs to be done so pangolins do not become extinct within our lifetime,&rdquo; he said.Pangolin scales are believed to have curative properties in East Asia, and their meat is highly regarded.International Fund for Animal Welfare honorary board member Jane Goodall said, &ldquo;While it is horrifying to think all species are so endangered, we must hope the new level of protection will save these wonderful animals from extinction before it is too late.&rdquo;IFAW has been leading efforts to increase protection for pangolins in the US and internationally. Working in conjunction with other NGOs, it petitioned to get all eight species of pangolins listed as endangered under the US Endangered Species Act.Small and scaly, pangolins once inhabited vast portions of Asia and Africa. According to IFAW data last year, there was a staggering number of seizures of pangolin scales and meat in source, transit, and market countries.The species vary in size from about 1.6kg to a maximum of 33kg. Pangolins eat ants and termites using their long, sticky tongues. They are able to roll themselves up into a tight ball when threatened.
