But in Mombasa, we saw a senator who was always criticising the county leadership," he said."...he (Omar) failed to secure billions for this region," Abbas, who previously served as Transport executive before being transferred to the youth docket, said.He said Mombasa, despite being number two in revenue contribution towards the National Treasury, is ranked 23rd in terms of distribution of resources from the national government."We are the second best in revenue contribution towards the Treasury, but we have been getting only Sh5.3 billion from the same government," Abbas said." Kilifi and Kwale counties, which are not near us in terms of revenue generation, have been getting a larger share," he added.Abbas argued that Omar forgot his role and got absorbed in anti-Joho campaigns instead of pushing for equitable resources to the county."As a senator, I will continue advocating for youth employment in this region by pushing for more resources," he said.
