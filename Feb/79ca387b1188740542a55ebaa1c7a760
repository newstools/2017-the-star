Now, I have found a voice,&rdquo; she said.Yesterday, Mombasa county Jubilee chairman Matano Chengo confirmed that Katana will tomorrow meet President Uhuru during his region tour.Chengo said Katana&rsquo;s defection to Jubilee has dealt a big blow to Joho&rsquo;s camp and ODM because the governor is likely to lose the Mijikenda vote bloc.Katana is a Mijikenda and their partnership with Joho in 2013 is said to have enabled the county boss clinch the seat with a big margin. The Mijikenda community is the single largest voting bloc in Mombasa county.Insiders said the aggressive nature of Joho&rsquo;s politics played a role in Katana&rsquo;s defection from ODM. She is said to be a timid leader, who does not like confrontation.President Uhuru will also meet other Jubilee officials after touring Kwale county.
