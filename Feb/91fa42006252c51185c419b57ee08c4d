Residents of Lavington have sued the county government over the filthy Kirichwa River, which runs through the neighbourhood and flows into the Nairobi River. They want the river cleaned and people stopped from dumping garbage in it. They also want the county and government agencies to carry out a survey from its source to the drainage to detect, arrest and eliminate all pollution sources within a month. Tenants of Castle Rock Apartments said the blame lies with Environment CS Judi Wakhungu, Nema and Nairobi Water and Sewerage Company. They say the river has degenerated into a smelly open sewer due to discharge of raw sewage by upstream users. They blamed this on failure by government agencies to monitor waste disposal and offer sewerage services.
