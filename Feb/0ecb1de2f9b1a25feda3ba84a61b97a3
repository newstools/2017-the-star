The Judiciary will deal firmly with election disputes and criminal offences, and punish those disrupting peace during elections and campaigns, Chief Justice David Maraga said yesterday.&ldquo;We do not want a repeat of 2007-08 [post-election violence]. Kenya belongs to all of us and we must protect it,&rdquo; he said.Maraga spoke during the official opening of Mpeketoni law courts in Lamu county. Earlier, the CJ held talks with Governor Issa Timamy who offered the Judiciary three acres at Mokowe for the construction of a High Court.He also pledged a building to host a High Court sub-registry before the main court is constructed.The CJ said the new court will improve access to justice in Lamu by reducing the long distances that court users had to cover previously before mobile court services were introduced in Mpeketoni.He urged residents to embrace alternative dispute resolution for less serious matters to reduce backlog in courts and promote social harmony.However, the CJ cautioned police and litigants against resolving sexual offences and other serious crimes at home.The CJ will today open the new Garsen High Court that will bring to 39 the number of High Court stations in Kenya. So far, only eight counties are without High Court stations. The law requires the Judiciary to establish a High Court station in each county.Last month, the CJ opened two High Court Stations in Narok and Kabarnet. He also opened a refurbished Children&rsquo;s Court in Nakuru.
