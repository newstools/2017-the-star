Embu Senator Lenny Kivuti yesterday led hundreds of local macadamia farmers in demanding for the release of Chinese nationals arrested in Meru for alleged lack business permits.Kivuti condemned the arrest and detention of the seven Chinese nationals, who are macadamia buyers, for allegedly doing business in the country without the relevant licences and documents. They have been held since Thursday.Speaking at the Mutunduri market in Embu North subcounty, he asked the police to handle the foreigners in according to the law.He said it was wrong for the police to be used by macadamia brokers to harass the foreigners because the latter were offering a better price to the farmers.The Chinese have reportedly been buying the nuts at Sh150 and above for a kilo, while the brokers and local processing industries buy at Sh70 and below. He promised the farmers he will see to it that the seven are released to continue with their business.&ldquo;Detaining someone over allegations of buying macadamia is wrong. It is illegal to hold someone in custody for more than 48 hours,&rdquo; Kivuti said. The senator also organised a meeting following several bitter protests by the macadamia farmers over the nose-diving of the prices from Sh200 to Sh50. Kivuti, who is aspiring for Embu governor was accompanied by his running mate Emilio Kathuri and Manyatta MP hopeful Gitonga Mukunji.
