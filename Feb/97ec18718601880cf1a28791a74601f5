Amid protests from family, friends and lawyers of the four suspected drug dealers extradited secretly to the US on Tuesday, Muslim clerics in Mombasa have supported the decision and called for more action against drug barons.Council of Imams and Preachers of Kenya organising secretary Sheikh Mohamed Khalifa said drug barons have destroyed the many youths, especially at the Coast, where an estimated 60,000 young people are hooked to hard drugs.&ldquo;Our jails cannot be filled by youth victims of drugs, yet the barons are walking scot-free,&rdquo; he said.Khalifa spoke at his office after a meeting of the council to find ways of enhancing their cooperation with the security agencies in the fight against drugs.This comes a day after President Uhuru reiterated his push to have the drug menace eliminated. He landed in Mombasa on Tuesday ahead of his visit of Kwale yesterday.&ldquo;We shall not allow the lives of youths and those of their families to be destroyed by drug barons&hellip;we are going for the big fish,&rdquo; Uhuru said at the GPO.Baktash Akasha, his brother Ibrahim Akasha, Vijay Goswami and Hussein Shabakash arrived in New York on Tuesday after being secretly extradited by the Kenyan government in a joint operation with American security agencies.US authorities have been looking for the four since 2014.The CIPK said it is ready to help the security agencies in any way to deal with drug barons.&ldquo;We support any move by the security agencies to ensure drugs are not brought into the country,&rdquo; Khalifa said.The Muslims clerics have been vocal against drugs at the Coast and the extradition of the four is a major win in the fight against drugs for them and the country at large.However, the clerics urged the government to root out all elements that help in the drugs trade including senior officers in the security circles and the Judiciary.&ldquo;There are people who collude with these drug barons and they are in the security department and the Judiciary. We want them identified and rooted out,&rdquo; said Sheikh Khalifa.
