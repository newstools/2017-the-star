Bomachoge Borabu MP Joel Onyancha is the biggest beneficiary in the ongoing political realignments in Kisii town.Two of his main rivals were named as running mates by governor hopefuls.Former Ford People chairman Albert Nyaundi will be Senator Chris Obure&rsquo;s running mate, while Nairobi Environment executive Peter Kimori is likely to be Governor James Ongwae&rsquo;s running mate.Kisii Deputy Governor Joash Maangi will battle it out for the JP ticket with Obure. &ldquo;He is the perfect choice. This is also in the interest of all the opinion leaders, colleagues and friends that I have consulted,&rdquo; Obure said. The three have battled it out in the past three elections with Onyancha narrowly emerging winner. Following the exit of Nyaundi and Kimori, Onyancha is almost assured of re-election.He will, however, face Josiah Maaga, Jason Ondabu, Lameck Mokua and Duke Mainga. ODM leader Raila Odinga said Kimori will be Ongwae&rsquo;s running mate after his deputy Maangi joined Jubilee Party. Raila made the announcement at Gusii Stadium two weeks ago when he received former UN-Habitat ambassador Sam Ongeri, who defected from Jubilee.
