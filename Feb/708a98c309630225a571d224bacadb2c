The Narok government will sponsor peace talks between elders from the Maasai and Kipsigis communities, Governor Samuel Tunai has said.The talks to be held in Naivasha on February 17 and 18 will seek to resolve a land problem between the two communities. The boundary dispute between the Shartuka and Njipship group ranches has resulted in the death of at least 10 people in one year. More than 100 houses on the Trans Mara East and Trans Mara West border have been torched.Tunai said his government has been ready for the talks for many months, but he had not secured a date with the National Land Commission, which is a key player. He spoke at Oronkai Primary School in Trans Mara West subcounty on Wednesday.Tunai said NLC chairman Muhammad Swazuri will attend the talks.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m committed to ensure the Maasai and their Kipsigis neighbours live in peace,&rdquo; Tunai said.During a peace meeting at Pirrar Girls Secondary School last August, he promised to sponsor the peace talks.The meeting was attended by Kilgoris MP Gideon Konchellah and Emurua Dikirr MP Johana Ng&rsquo;eno.
