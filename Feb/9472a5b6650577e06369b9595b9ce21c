Political Parties Liaison Committee chairman Philip Obonyo has accused the electoral commission of overlooking it during the mass voter registration campaign.Yesterday, he said, &ldquo;The IEBC made the first mistake by using NGOs to sensitise voters on the need to register. NGOs lack the ground to convince voters. Our committee should have been involved in mobilising potential voters since we have the network at the grassroots level.&rdquo; This comes days after IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati released the commission&rsquo;s weekly voter registration updates indicating that it had failed to hit its target for the second week running. So far, out of the 6.1 million voters the commission had targeted to register within two weeks, a paltry 1.53 million have been registered. Obonyo, who is also chairman of the Federal Party of Kenya, said the liaison committee can help improve listing.
