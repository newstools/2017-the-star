Two-time world cross country champion Violah Kibiwott and world 3,000m steeplechase champion Hyvin Kiyeng staged a brilliant showing, winning the Athletics Kenya Central Rift cross country championships at Mosoriot Teachers Training College in Nandi county.The duo produced sterling shows on Saturday, wowing large crowds that lined up along the lush green course.They exchanged the lead with siblings Norah Jeruto and Daisy Chepkemei in the initial stages before they fired away, opening a wide gap.When the going got tougher, Jeruto and Jepkemei dropped the leading pack as the two stars Kibiwott and Kiyeng led the onslaught.They ran shoulder to shoulder until the last 100m when Kibiwott outsprinted Kiyeng to win the race.She stopped the timer in 34:51.16, beating Kiyeng to second in 34:51.68.Former world youth 2000m steeplechase queen Jepkemei finished third in 35:32.04.Daisy Jepkemei, Hyvin Kiyeng and Violah Kibiwott competing during the Athletics Kenya Central Rift Cross Country championship in Nandi, February 4, 2017. /STANLEY MAGUTJeruto settled in fourth in 35:52.89, followed by Sheilah Jebet (36:14.77) and Hellen Jepkorir (36:34.96), to cut the team for the national trials.Kibiwott, who has since moved to road competition, said she will be running her last cross country this year."I have two medals from the cross country junior category and I will try to make team for world cross country," she said.In the men&rsquo;s 10km race, Lagos Marathon winner Abraham Kiptum shook off stiff competition from the Olympic steeplechase champion Conseslus Kipruto to emerge victorious.Kipruto dropped after the 3km mark in the highly paced race, as Continental cup winner Jairus Birech and Nixon Chepseba held on.But they went off the radar, leaving Kiptum, Joseph Tanui and Noah Kipkemboi exchanging the lead.With experience on the road and from some cross country wins, Kiptum opened a gap after 7km surging forward until when he cut the tape.He clocked 29:58.43 to win the title, while Tanui timed 30:10.47 in second, and Kipkemboi settled third in 30:11.24.Emmanuel Bor (30:18.84), Julius Kogo (30:29.59) and Hillary Maiyo (30:41.21) followed in that order.&ldquo;At first it was hard since we started at a high pace and we had champions. But after the 3km, I got motivated and went forward. I am very delighted by the victory,&rdquo; said Kiptum who won Ndalat Cross country last year.In the 8km junior men, World Youth 3000m gold medallist Richard Kimunyan carried the day in 23:52.78, beating Nicholas Kimeli (23:56.94), and Ronex Kipruto (24:02.53) to second and third respectively.Upcoming runner Chebet Ng&rsquo;etich won the 6km junior race in 20:43.88, edging out Ann Nyagothie to second in 20:48.55, and Rosemary Mumo came third in 21:02.00.
