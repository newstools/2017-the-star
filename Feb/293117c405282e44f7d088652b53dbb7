The Jubilee administration has taken its campaign to the Coast and expressed confidence it has made inroads in the perceived opposition stronghold.Deputy President William Ruto yesterday told residents not to be misled by other parties that they were Coastal parties. He spoke in Kaloleni.This was in response to a recent Umoja Summit meeting earlier this week, which resolved the region will have a presidential candidates to counter other candidates and have a Coastal outlook.Ruto, was accompanied by Kilifi North MP Gideon Mungaro, nominated Senator Mshenga Kishasha and Kilifi South MP Mustafa Iddi.The DP had gone to receive Kahindi Ngao, a brother of Kilifi speaker Jimmy Kahindi, who has defected from ODM and is now eyeing the Kaloleni MP seat.The seat is currently occupied by Kadu Asili's Gunga Mwinga.Ngao said he will spearhead the Jubilee campaigns in Kaloleni."I'm confident Jubilee will win in the August election and Coast region will largely vote for the party. The registration of voters clearly shows Jubilee has more support countrywide," Ruto said.Mung'aro and Iddi said Coast residents will back the Jubilee Party in August. They said JP had achieved a lot for the region and deserves reelection.Ruto said while Jubilee is working to develop the county by constructing roads and providing electricity, Cord leaders are busy creating powerful positions for themselves."Cord leaders have nothing to show for the time they were in government. There is nothing new they will offer," Mung'aro said.Ruto enumerated development projects in the Coast, among them the port expansion, road construction, provision of electricity among others.They said NASA leaders were in government for years Raila as Prime Minister, Kalonzo Musyoka as Vice President and ministers, but they never did anything for Coast residents.Ruto also inspected construction of the Mariakani-Bamba Kilifi road.He said he is impressed with the progress of the 52km road, which was started six months ago.The road is expected to open up the area and bring new investment opportunities.Mung'aro promised to improve water supply if elected the Kilifi governor. He is facing Governor Amason Kingi, former minister Kazungu Kambi, among others.Mung'aro also hit out at the Kilifi government, which he said has nothing to show for the billions of shillings allocated to it by the state."The county is misusing resources. When residents are drinking dirty water, the governor (Kingi) spent Sh47 million to organise a beauty pageant," he said.Mung'aro said it is the duty of the county government to provide water and sink boreholes. The meeting was also attended by Kilifi speaker Jimmy Kahindi, who is allied to Cord."You should ask the county government [Kilifi] to account for the Sh9.5 billion yearly allocation it gets from the national government," Ruto said.He said most of issues affecting the common mwananchi like health, rural roads and agriculture are supposed to be addressed by the county government."The county government here gets close to Sh10 billion. What has it done with the money?" he posed.
