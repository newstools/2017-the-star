Last Friday's attack of ODM leader Raila Odinga's rally in Turkana was in bad taste and shows lack of democracy, two leaders have said.Woman representative Joyce Emanikor and youth leader Ben Lokwam said Raila and other politicians should be allowed to campaign in peace.In a statement yesterday, Emanikor said, &ldquo;We should not behave in an uncivilized manner. Kenya is a democratic nation and as the people of Turkana we should listen to everyone and then make our own informed decisions when we go to vote."About 15 gunmen on Friday stormed Raila&rsquo;s meeting at Katilie where he was meeting ODM delegates. The youth fired gunshots and three stones at the meeting forcing Raila&rsquo;s security detail to whisk him to safety.
