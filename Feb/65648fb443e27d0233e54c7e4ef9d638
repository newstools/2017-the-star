The Treasury has proposed that the counties receive Sh323.8 billion for the 2017-18 financial year.This is a Sh21.6 billion increase from last year&rsquo;s Sh302 .4 billionNext Tuesday, the Division of Revenue Bill - which outlines the allocations to the national and county governments - is expected to be tabled in the Senate.The Bill is prepared by the Treasury, but MPs and senators can suggest changes.In the Bill, Sh291.1 billion will be distributed equally. In addition to that, the counties have been given a conditional allocation of Sh12.2 billion, and a further Sh20.4 billion to finance transferred functions.The additional amount however, will not cater for the unresolved transfer of 32,000km of Class D roads to the counties.The counties will get a conditional grant of Sh4.5 billion to lease medical equipment, Sh4.2 billion for Level 5 hospitals, and Sh900 million for county health facilities.Five counties - Lamu, Tana River, Nyandarua, Lamu and Tharaka Nithi - will get Sh605 million as a conditional grant to construct county headquarters offices.The grant is part of a three-year plan to supplement the contribution of the five counties towards building the headquarters. The amount will be shared equally.The national government&rsquo;s contribution in the bill translates to 70 per cent of the budget. County governments will contribute the balance - 30 percent.Another Sh2 billion has been allocated for the rehabilitation of village polytechnics, Sh7.9 billion will be allocated for a conditional grant for the Road Maintenance Fuel Levy Fund. The grant has existed for three years. It has increased from the Sh4.3 billion allocated in the 2016-17 budget.This translates to 83 per cent increase arising from the increase in the fuel levy. The grant is meant to enhance the county government&rsquo;s capacity to repair and maintain roads.
