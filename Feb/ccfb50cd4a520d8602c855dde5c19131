The Mombasa government will set up a cancer centre in the county, Governor Hassan Joho has said.Joho was Wednesday responding to former mayor and ally-turned-foe John Mcharo, who criticized the county for delaying the set up of a cancer facility in Mombasa. &ldquo;A first class cancer testing, screening and treatment facility costs between Sh300-Sh500 million. Mombasa can afford that. The investment can be recouped easily because such a facility can tap into medical tourism,&rdquo; Mcharo said.
