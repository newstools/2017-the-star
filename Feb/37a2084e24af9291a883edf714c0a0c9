The survival of NASA will depend on the flagbearer picked and the position of Luhyas in the new coalition, two analysts have said. Cord co-principals Raila Odinga (ODM), Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper) and Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula (Ford Kenya) and Amani leader Musalia Mudavadi on Tuesday signed a letter of intent to form NASA, signalling the death of Cord. Wetang&rsquo;ula and Ford-K deputy leader Boni Khalwale initially opposed NASA and instead asked its proponent, Mudavadi, to join Cord. They backed down after Raila and Kalonzo supported NASA. Yesterday, analyst Martin Andati said, &ldquo;The candidate picked as the flagbearer will either solidify the opposition&rsquo;s unity or cause serious voter apathy in perceived opposition strongholds that may favour Jubilee.&rdquo;He said the low turnout during voter listing in opposition zones is because its candidate has not yet been announced. Andati said, &ldquo;Luhyas are the largest voting bloc in the opposition and will not accept to be flower girls in NASA.&rdquo; Analyst Martin Oloo said NASA is unlikely to achieve a repeat of the 2002 election when parties joined under Narc to uproot Kanu from power. &ldquo;The Tosha slogan will not work this time, because the dynamics are different.&rdquo;
