Olympic 800m bronze medalist Margaret Nyairera is thrilled by the thought of making her international debut on grass as she prepares to represent Kenya at the World Cross Country Championships in Kampala, Uganda next month.Nyairera was named in the national cross country mixed relay team alongside world 1,500m champion Asbel Kiprop, Beatrice Chepkoech and Bernard Kipyego.&ldquo;It is always a great feeling to make the national team,&rdquo; said Nyairera. &ldquo;It is my first time to run cross country. It is not easy because the 2km I have to cover are way longer than the 400m and 800m which I am used to. However, I am prepared to go to Kampala and fight for my nation.&rdquo;&ldquo;I am happy to be part of the pioneering team now that the mixed relays are a new phenomenon,&rdquo; she added. Nyairera, who recently graduated at the Prisons Staff Training College, observed that the 2km split is more demanding and will have to prepare adequately when she reports to the Team Kenya residential training camp at Kigari Teachers Training College.&ldquo;The split requires a lot of endurance and will therefore be making a lot of long runs while at Kigari,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I know this will affect my 800m speed in the short term but I remain positive by using this as part of my training for the World Championships in London later in the year.&rdquo;Before winning the bronze medal at the Olympic Games, Nyairera had previously won the world junior title in Eugene in 2014, a bronze at the 2015 World Indoors as well as a 400m silver medal at the 2015 African Championships held in South Africa.She observed that since her feat in Rio, she has embraced a dormant mode as she went through the rigours of a tough training at the PSTC for six months but believes it was all for a good course.&ldquo;It was tough but I am glad I graduated accordingly. At first, we couldn&rsquo;t get so much time for our usual training but I am thankful to the department for granting us time to train prior to the nationals, resulting in the good performances,&rdquo; she said. She was at PSTC alongside Africa cross champion Alice Aprot, who is also in the party to Kampala.Meanwhile, Team Kenya head coach Wycliffe Ndiwa observed that the relays are an interesting addition to world cross and they are hoping to make a positive start.&ldquo;It is such a new event in the world of cross country running but it won&rsquo;t be that different for us,&rdquo; said Ndiwa of the 4x2km event.The race involves each of the four athletes&mdash;two men and two women&mdash; running a 2km split each with the men taking the baton first.&ldquo;Like I said, most of the athletes have been training on their own and we will have to go an extra mile in ensuring that we get our tactics right according to the strengths of the various athletes involved,&rdquo; said Ndiwa. Meanwhile, the team reported to camp in Kigari yesterday where they will train for one month before heading to Uganda.
