Kibwezi West MP hopeful James Mbaluki on Tuesday denied fraudulently obtaining Sh10 million from Kitui South MP Rachel Nyamai. He took a plea after the court dismissed his application to have it deferred so he can settle the matter out of court.The prosecution said that on July 25, 2014, he obtained the money by falsely pretending he could sell Nyamai land in Karen. Mbaluki was released on Sh2 million bond or an alternative Sh800,000 bail. The hearing is set for March 23.
