Meru Governor Peter Munya has opposed plans by Igembe South MP Mithika Linturi to move Kangeta Maximum Prisons to Akachiu, within the same constituency.He said residents have not been consulted, and some are being forced to sell their land to accommodate the facility.Munya was speaking at Nkinja Primary School when he opened an ECDE classroom.He said he has hired lawyer Tom Ojienda to file an application at the High Court. Munya said the government should determine the common border between Meru and Tharaka Nithi counties to end frequent clashes.&ldquo;I made a similar attempt and the demarcation of the Isiolo border was completed. People&rsquo;s land is being sold by the MP to create space for the prison. Let them wait until land is demarcated and owners have title deeds. After all, what is wrong with the prison being at Kangeta, let it stay there,&rdquo; Munya said.The Council of Governors chairman criticised plans by the national government to allocate another Sh1 billion for the miraa industry, saying no value has been realised from the initial allocation.He said a further allocation to the task force is a waste of resources because Sh1.6 billion is not accounted for.&ldquo;The miraa funds in the task force have never been used appropriately and was mismanaged to generate personal wealth for the elected leaders. In this financial year budget there is more one billion but before it is disbursed let us be told where the first Sh. 1.6 went to&rdquo;, said Munya.Igembe South MP aspirant Mithika Mzalendo also snubbed the elected leaders saying they have failed to protect the miraa crop and have contributed immensely to lack of market.
