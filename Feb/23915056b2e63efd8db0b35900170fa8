A fire destroyed 49 acres of Ruma National Park in Homa Bay county on Tuesday. Warden Felix Mwangangi said the fire started at God Jope in Mbita subcounty and spread to other parts. &ldquo;It was escalated by strong winds and we could not put it out. A heavy downpour later in the day put out the fire,&rdquo; Mwagangi said.
