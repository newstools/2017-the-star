A group of integrated IDPs in Nakuru have threatened to boycot the election if the government does not compensate them in seven days.On Tuesday, they marched from Afraha Stadium to the county commissioner&rsquo;s office and presented their grievances.Their chairman Roger Mwai said the government has abandoned them, despite a fund being set up to resettle them in the 2016-17 budget.&ldquo;Since we sought shelter from our relatives, the government has neglected us and focussed on resettling those in tents and from Uganda. We also want teh Sh400,000 the other IDPs have received,&rdquo; Mwai said.He added, &ldquo;We have waited long enough.&rdquo;
