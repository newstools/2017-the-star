With the dispute pitting Football Kenya Federation and the Kenyan Premier League over the composition of the Sportpesa Premier League still unresolved, former FKF president, Sam Nyamweya has offered his advise to the two differing parties. Nyamweya, whose regime&rsquo;s attempt to expand the top flight league in 2013 was vehemently opposed by KPL, vouched for an 18-team league but said the manner the federation was going about it was undermining efforts for expansion. &ldquo;Personally, I support the federation in their quest to expand the league, something that I believe KPL has accepted as inevitable. But determining which teams are promoted and which ones are relegated is the biggest bone of contention and both KPL and FKF must sit together and find a common ground on the matter,&rdquo; opined Nyamweya.The latest tiff between the two bodies who have not been good bedfellows was brought about by KPL&rsquo;s decision to release fixtures that were to kick off today and included Sofapaka and Muhoroni Youth, two clubs that FKF had relegated from the top division for failing to meet the club licensing threshold. &ldquo;Some of the affected teams (Sofapaka and Muhoroni ) are community clubs managed from personal amid family resources so it would have been my advise for the federation to give the clubs time to comply with the licensing rules. They are not cast on stone and should not be implemented to the detriment of sporting merit and football clubs,&rdquo; remarked Nyamweya.
