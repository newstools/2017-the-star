The opposition is in a dilemma over which candidate to pick for Kwale senator after the death of Boy Juma Boy two weeks ago. Divisions are evident and this might break the coalition.One ODM group has selected Boys&rsquo; younger brother Issah Boy to vie for the position on August 8, while a second one has picked Nominated Senator Agnes Zani. The third group supports the senator's brother Nicholas Zani.The tussle will determine if NASA will break or remain firm in the region.The developments are said to have compelled party leader Raila Odinga to plan an urgent visit to the county next Wednesday to put his house in order. President Uhuru Kenyatta is scheduled to visit the county in early March.Jubilee has made inroads in the county and is optimistic of winning the governor, senator and woman representative seats, but ODM is trying to erode the gains. On Thursday, a group of ODM members and residents from Matuga declared their support for Zani, saying she is the only person who can take over from Boy because of her leadership experience. Addressing journalists at Information House in Kwale, Tsimba Golini ODM chairman Hamisi Rachuo said that Zani campaigned to be ODM secretary general qualifies her for the Senate post. &ldquo;She has experience unlike others who are being fronted by families. She has helped the youth," he said.&ldquo;We cannot allow families to tell us who to elect. We don&rsquo;t want to vote for people who will change like Governor Salim Mvurya who defected to Jubilee.&rdquo; Rachuo Nicholas is being used by political brokers to bring confusion in the Zani family.&ldquo;We have political brokers supporting Nicholas, but Matuga people and Kwale at large support his sister Agnes. We have advised Nicholas to support his sister instead,&rdquo; he said.
