ONE of the great shocks of the 2013 election was the defeat of the then undisputed king of Maasai politics, William ole Ntimama, in his attempt at reelection.This was because of the over three decades he had been preeminent in politics, first as chairman of the Narok County Council and then as MP for Narok North.Indeed, the stature that Ntimama had acquired was such that he could stare down presidents and even his own post-Kanu party leader, Raila Odinga, at the peak of the latter&rsquo;s power as Prime Minister (2008-2013). The idea that such a man could lose his seat at a time when just a few months earlier it was reported candidates for senator and governor in Narok were seeking his blessing added all the more to the stunning shock of the defeat. EXPLAINING THE SHOCKING ELECTORAL DEFEAT OF "THE KING OF MAASAI"Later, this shocking defeat was explained as being the result of massive, undetected shifts in voter populations, with "migrant communities" like the Kikuyu and Kisii having been increasingly moving into Narok county, and "settler communities" like the Kipsigis also commanding a huge number of votes in the county - these being people who had no particular loyalty to Ntimama.But the phenomenon of politicians with extraordinary power nationally who are nonetheless extremely vulnerable within their own backyards when it comes to retaining their seats is far more common than you would imagine.In the Moi era there were figures like Kipyator Nicholas Kiprono Biwott, the self-styled &ldquo;Total Man&rdquo;, who seemed invincible and indeed was considered to have influence far beyond his parliamentary constituency. Yet even such figures ultimately lose to previously unknown candidates even after putting up the most vigorous and moneyed campaigns.This is one perspective from which Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho can be best explained. He is not only governor, but Deputy Leader of ODM right across the country, and has spent lavishly to organize support both for Raila personally and for the Orange party. And Joho has also taken a lead in bravely confronting both President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto and many other Jubilee Party luminaries, fearlessly trading harsh words with them and generally standing out as a major league political player.Yet, despite all this, Joho remains remarkably vulnerable in any attempt he will make to remain Governor of Mombasa.Joho&rsquo;s vulnerability arises from four key factors. The first is the tyranny of demographics: As a general principle we may identify the key vote blocs in Mombasa County as follows. The Giriama comprise 40 per cent of the region&rsquo;s population; the Akamba 20; the Luo/Luhya group 20; and the Swahili/Arab 20.It should further be noted that the Swahili/Arab community usually registers the lowest turnout of these vote blocs and therefore tends towards roughly 10 per cent of votes cast in the county.What&rsquo;s more, the Akamba vote is often underestimated because a sizeable chunk of Mombasa&rsquo;s ethnic Kamba residents are long-time converts to Islam and so a glance at the voter register would give the impression that they are part of the Swahili/Arab community. If you actually meet many an Abdalla Mohamed, for instance, you will be surprised to find he speaks fluent Kikamba. THE KALONZO FACTORThe large number of ethnic Kamba living at the Coast gives Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka (as of now the undisputed king of Kamba politics) some very strong cards to play in the outcome of Mombasa County politics.This is actually a pattern that has been present since the 1970s, when Kambas traditionally held the Changamwe parliamentary seat at a time when the Coast had only four MPs. Joho is not particularly close to Kalonzo and the Wiper secretary general, Mombasa Senator Omar Hassan, who has expressed his interest in becoming governor. It remains to be seen if Kalonzo would prefer Governor Joho to his own SG when the time comes for him to throw his weight behind a contender for governor.THE GIRIAMA/MIJIKENDA FACTORThe voting habits of the indigenous Giriama encourage many observers to underestimate the community in much the same way the Kikuyu community&rsquo;s vote clout is sometimes underrated in capital city Nairobi. Just as there hundreds of thousands of Kikuyus who reside in Kiambu town, Thika town and indeed all the way to Murang&rsquo;a, who commute daily to work in Nairobi, so too do you find there are tens of thousands of Giriamas who live in Mtwapa, Kikambala and Mazeras who commute to their employment in Mombasa.Such commuters can either register in their home areas or else in Mombasa town where they work. It all depends on how motivated and inspired they are.In this context a major blunder committed by Governor Joho is about to cost him dearly. When she recently defected from ODM to the ruling JP, Deputy Governor of Mombasa Hazel Katana spoke with great bitterness of having been serially mistreated, denied her salary and frequently insulted by being called lazy, stupid, worthless and valueless.For anyone who understands the psychology of the Coast region, Katana&rsquo;s remarks were a dog whistle message to the Giriama nation that Governor Joho has the same contempt for them the old slave masters of the Coast had for the Mijikendas.This point might seem trivial and improbable to people outside the Coast, but in point of fact there is nothing more likely to mobilise Giriama voters than such a passionate claim that a Swahili/Arab politician who is seeking their votes for reelection is on record as having made contemptuous remarks about a prominent daughter of their community.THE LUO/LUHYA SWING VOTEUntil the arrival of the current Nyali MP Hezron Awiti, it had been a strict rule of coastal politics that the Luo/Luhya vote bloc did not compete with the indigenous Girima and Swahili/Arab communities for leadership positions beyond those of the former councilors and the current MCAs.This gave leaders like Jaramogi Oginga Odinga, Masinde Muliro and, more recently, Raila Odinga, huge influence in Mombasa politics in as far as they could throw a sizeable number of votes behind any Coast leaders and also prevail on their own tribesmen in the region not to compete with the locals.The clearest evidence of this is former Mombasa mayor and current Tourism Cabinet Secretary Najib Balala. So long as he enjoyed Raila&rsquo;s patronage, he appeared to be invincible in his Mvita Constituency, winning in 2002 and 2007. When in 2013 Raila transferred his patronage to Abdulswamad Nassir, Balala ran for senator from Mombasa and was beaten by a complete newcomer &ndash; Omar.However, with Awiti in the picture and gunning for governor against Joho, a toxic anti-Joho message has arisen from the Awiti camp. This is the claim that Joho has a secret and profound contempt for the Luo community and that only riding on Raila&rsquo;s coattails got him to become governor.In short, the Luo are saying, &ldquo;Joho only became governor because of our votes and support but once he was safely in office he showed us nothing but contempt. This is a mistake that we will not repeat&rdquo;.So it is very likely that we will see at the Coast a pattern established within Luo Nyanza in 2013. That is to say that even among Raila&rsquo;s most fanatical followers there can be no guarantee of a six-piece voting pattern. They may vote ODM, Cord or NASA on the presidential ballot, but willingly reject local leaders who have disappointed them, even if they are on Raila&rsquo;s party ticket. JOHO&rsquo;S STRONG POINTSWhat then can we say are Joho&rsquo;s strong points to counter all this even as he prepares to go down in flames on August 8? Basically, he has only two. First the likely support of Raila and then the expectation that he will spend astonishing sums of money to be reelected. He will most likely outspend all the other candidates combined.And the other candidates of course have weaknesses that Joho can cleverly exploit.Awiti&rsquo;s Achilles&rsquo; Heel is that if indeed he were to run for governor it would completely demolish the deep support that Raila has all over the Coast if it were seen that one of his tribesmen is running for a major patronage-laden position that should be properly left to the indigenous coastal people to fight over.It can categorically be said that Raila has no choice but to crush Awiti&rsquo;s candidature while it is still in its embryonic stage.Suleiman Shahbal, the runner-up to Joho in 2013, also has a fundamental weakness as he prepares to run on the Jubilee ticket: No party even remotely associated with the Kikuyu or Kalenjin communities is likely to fare well at the Coast. These two communities have been inevitably stigmatized as being the ones on whose watch this region has long been trapped in a cycle of poverty. This leaves Omar, the only other candidate in the race to have won a countywide race. His weakness is that coming from a background of human rights advocacy, he has never engaged in any of the business deals politicians often use to stuff their campaign coffers. Politics is an expensive business and Omar simply does not have the resources to mount an effective campaign to dethrone Joho, given how much money the latter will bring into the contest.To this extent the race may still be wide open, but Governor Joho&rsquo;s vulnerabilities are clear and there is every possibility that, despite his image at the county and at the national levels, he will lose miserably in his herculean effort at reelection.
