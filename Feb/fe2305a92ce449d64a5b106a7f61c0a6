Madonna has been granted permission to adopt two more children from Malawi after the High Court in the impoverished southern African country gave its approval. The US singer's previous adoptions stirred anger among some Malawians who accused the government of allowing the pop star to skirt laws that ban non-residents from adopting children. Madonna was inside the courtroom when the approval ruling was delivered, Mlenga Mvula, a spokesman for Malawi's judiciary said on Tuesday. "Today the High Court made a ruling that she should go ahead and adopt the two children," Mvula told Reuters, adding that the singer was smiling after the court's ruling. Mvula could not provide details on the children Madonna will adopting, saying it was against the law to divulge such particulars at this stage. "Within a year she should provide us with a home survey report which the court has ordered her to provide," Mvula said, referring to one of the conditions of the adoption. Madonna, 58, adopted Malawian children David Banda and Mercy James in 2006 and 2009. The mega-selling pop singer has two other children, Lourdes and Rocco, from previous relationships. Madonna had denied reports that she wanted to adopt again after she visited Malawi last month, at the time saying her trip was for her charity work.Madonna established the non-profit Raising Malawi in 2006 to provide health and education programs, particularly for girls, in the southeast African country.
