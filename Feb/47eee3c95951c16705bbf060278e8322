The Treasury has not delayed the disbursement of funds to deal with drought, Agriculture PS Richard Lesiyampe has said.Yesterday, he said the ministry has received Sh3.2 billion for this financial year to buy maize for the strategic food reserve, and has bought 1.4 million bags. The PS appeared before the National Assembly Agriculture committee to explain how the supplementary budget will be used. He denied media reports which had quoted him as saying the ministry is yet to receive cash. &ldquo;I was misquoted. That&rsquo;s a serious statement and is incorrect. At no point did I talk about the national Treasury failing to give us money. We have the money to finance the national strategic food reserve. The problem we are facing today is that farmers are not releasing maize because of the prices we are offering,&rdquo; Lesiyampe said.He added, &ldquo;There is nowhere the national Treasury comes in in this matter. I was misquoted.&rdquo; On Tuesday, the PS appeared before the Agriculture committee and was quoted as saying his ministry had received only Sh1.5 billion out of Sh10.4 billion required to address drought.Lesiyampe said farmers are not selling their maize to the National Cereals and Produce Board even though the government is buying it at Sh3,000 per 90kg bag. Traders and millers are buying the maize at about Sh3,400, he said. Lesiyampe said drought is a natural disaster and no government agency should be blamed for it. The Agriculture department is responsible for dealing with drought. &ldquo;Our focus is on buying seedlings. So far we have received Sh144 million to buy drought-resistant seedlings,&rdquo; Lesiyampe said.The PS said the government will distribute seedlings to farmers in preparation for the long rains expected to start mid next month.
