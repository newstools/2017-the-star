Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero has exuded confidence he will reclaim his seat, regardless of the Jubilee Party candidate fielded.He said he is not worried about Jubilee&rsquo;s efforts to find a strong candidate to unseat him.&ldquo;I am a member of ODM and NASA. We are doing our own thing. We don&rsquo;t care about what they are doing the other side. Let them bring their person, we will floor them,&rdquo; Kidero said.He spoke in Mowlem, Embakasi West constituency, on Saturday. Kidero said those &ldquo;eyeing my seat&rdquo; and making the loudest noise about his development record are cartels who have robbed the city for many years.&ldquo;They were employing their people, who did not have any education. We know them and we are trying to sort their mess,&rdquo; he said.Kidero added, &ldquo;Nairobians have no time for cartels. Very soon I will tell you the land they grabbed and we will tell them to return it. I will also tell you people who were taking commissions for approval of buildings in Nairobi.&rdquo; Last Friday, a group of Jubilee politicians calling itself Team Nairobi announced it will unveil its candidate for the governor seat today.The group consists of Senator Mike Sonko, former Starehe MP Margaret Wanjiru, Dagoretti South MP Dennis Waweru and nominated MP Johnson Sakaja. They all want to be the JP governor candidate.Another team led by Starehe MP Maina Kamanda is fronting former presidential candidate Peter Kenneth for the seat. Team Nairobi has opposed Kenneth&rsquo;s candidature, terming him an &lsquo;outsider&rsquo;.Kenneth has said he is not an outsider and has lived in the city for many years. He said he will not back out of the race. Kidero said, &ldquo;I will work for the people of Nairobi until the last minute. I don&rsquo;t care about elections. What I want is to deliver better services.&rdquo;
