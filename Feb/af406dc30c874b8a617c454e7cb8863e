In a last push to register more voters, Urai Trust has sponsored Transform Empowerment Action Initiative to carry out awareness campaigns in Kisumu and Siaya counties. Zephaniah Kore, dean of the ACK cathedral in Kisumu, flagged off the campaign's caravans on Sunday. &ldquo;Kenyans must come out and register as voters to exercise their democratic right because rights comes with responsibility. If this [won't] work very well, then we won&rsquo;t change the regime we have been talking about," he said.
