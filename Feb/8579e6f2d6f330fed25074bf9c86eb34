Haki Africa has called for proper investigations to net culprits who assault and sexually harass women.Executive director Hussein Khalid yesterday said there violence against Kenyan women is increasing. In statement to newsrooms, he said this has led to fear and disenfranchised women so that they lag behind in development and find it difficult to support their families.Khalid cited a case in which a 23-year-old woman was gang-raped, slashed, tied on railway line and struck by a speeding train. Though she survived, she had her legs amputated and is currently at the Aga Khan Hospital, Mombasa. &ldquo;Haki Africa and others continue to seek justice for her family and to reach out to well-wishers to assist with the medical bill that now stands at more Sh2 million,&rdquo; he said.Khalid also said a 22-year-old girl was beaten by her former employer and lost her right eye. He blamed the authorities for laxity and called for the arrest of the boss. Khalid said justice to all should be prioritised and urged women to stand up for their rights.
