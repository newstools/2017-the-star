National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale has warned school heads not to violate the presidential directive against sending children home over fees arrears.He said most parents in the counties hard-hit by the drought cannot afford to pay school fees now that their source of livelihood has been wiped out. &ldquo;Failure to follow the presidential directive or your immediate boss, amounts to insubordination. The head teachers are aware of this,&rdquo; Duale said on Monday.He said the government will ensure no student drops out of school due to lack of fees during the dry spell.Duale was responding to complaints by some parents whose children have been sent home over school fees arrears.But a head teacher from one of the remote schools, who requested anonymity, said the directive is political and is hurting the running of the schools. &ldquo;If we are to fully comply with this directive, then we shall end up closing the schools,&rdquo; the head teacher said.
