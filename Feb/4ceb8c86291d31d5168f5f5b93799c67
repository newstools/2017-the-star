Former Cabinet minister Fred Gumo&rsquo;s son, Mike, yesterday said he will run for Parklands MCA.While on a tour of the area, he criticised area MCA Jaffer Kassam, saying he has done little in development.Mike challenged Kassam to show residents what he has done for the last 10 years. Before he was elected MCA in 2013, Kassam was a nominated councillor for five years. &ldquo;We need fresh leadership. We need young people who have the interests of the people at heart,&rdquo; Mike said.He said he will push the county administration to ensure clean water and motorable roads. &ldquo;Jaffer has not defended the people. We have had a lot of reports of Parklands residents, especially the elderly, being harassed by land grabbers. We have not seen Jaffer come out to defend his people,&rdquo; he said.
