When we say the Jubilee government has failed, that is not making a sweeping accusation without any facts to back it up. Rather, it is a statement that can be backed with facts that are openly and readily observable, verifiable and therefore indisputable. Unlike, for example, the Donald Trump administration, which anyone can see is a failing government right off the gate, the same couldn&rsquo;t be said about the Uhuru government once the 2013 election was over and the Supreme Court upheld the win, in a decision few disagree is the worst that court will ever render.Indeed, going by how they unveiled their Cabinet, in matching white shirts and red ties, projecting an aura of youthfulness, one could imagine the likelihood of President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto forming a government that could be successful, notwithstanding their facing serious criminal offenses at the ICC.But it wasn&rsquo;t long after they were sworn in before UhuRuto obviated what many already knew: Their priority number one was to use state resources to thwart and ultimately succeed in walking away from the ICC without convictions, as they eventually did. So much that for the first two years of the Uhuru presidency, all the focus was on leaving the ICC, when they were not busy filling every possible position in government with their tribesmen and women. They reserved the best positions for their cronies and hangers-on, who in turn made sure they successfully engaged in massive corruption.And that&rsquo;s a shame, reason and fact number one that this is a failed government.To be sure, some of us &mdash; and to the chagrin of those with whom we have been in the opposition trenches &mdash; rooted for the duo&rsquo;s success for, after all, we only have one President and one administration at a time and we have, as a country, needs that must be met.Instead of capitalising on that goodwill and delivering on their promises for the sake of our country, President Kenyatta and Deputy President Ruto squandered it all and, even worse, allowed their cronies to engage in even more corruption, worse than this country has ever endured, which is reason and fact number two why this is a failed government.There&rsquo;s not enough time or space here to analyse all the failures of the Jubilee government based strictly on the promises made in their manifesto. They have failed to deliver on those promises, let alone even try, while pretending to launch &ldquo;new&rdquo; projects when in reality, they were put in the pipeline by none other than the person who gives them the most shivers.Suffice it to say, however, that Jubilee has failed to deliver on promises ranging from providing transformational leadership, when they&rsquo;ve given us worse, to making Kenya safe when, as one blogger put it, &ldquo;The police have all the weapons and vehicles they need to arrive at a place where it is easy to trample on the rights of the common citizens but not to protect themselves from sporadic al Shabaab attacks and bandits in places such as Suguta Valley and Kapedo.&rdquo; From empowering the youth, where the massive looting at NYS tells you all you need to know, to providing food security where, as this same blogger puts it, &ldquo;people are still dying of hunger in 21st Century Kenya and of all places in Tiaty constituency, where Jubilee reaped 51, 000 votes out of a possible 22,000.&rdquo; From a healthy Kenya, in which the doctors&rsquo; strike tells you all you need to know to, last but not least, tribalism, which is now worse than ever before.These are just but a few facts and reasons why the Jubilee government has failed, and which the majority of the voters going to the polls must have in mind in sweeping them out of office come August 8.
