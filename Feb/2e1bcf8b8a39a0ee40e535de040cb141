Kakamega is the political hotbed of Western politics and as such, it has attracted immense political interest from both the opposition and the Jubilee Party.Senator Boni Khalwale of Ford Kenya, former Medical Services minister Amukowa Anangwe, businesswoman Marbel Muruli and Major (Rtd) Suleiman Sumba of Jubilee have lined up to unseat incumbent Governor Wycliffe Oparanya, in what promises to be a titanic battle.The competition is, however, crystallising into a two-horse race &mdash; between NASA and Jubilee.The politics centre on sugarcane farming, party affiliations and sharing of key elective seats by different groups.Governor Oparanya, who has been on a warpath with Senator Khalwale, hopes to anchor his reelection campaign on his development record in the last four years albeit shrouded in corruption allegations. Oparanga is one of the two top ODM party leaders.Pollsters A survey done by the University of Nairobi in October rated Oparanya&rsquo;s popularity at 71 per cent, followed by Khalwale at 17 per cent and Muruli at five per cent. No respondent apparently mentioned Anangwe.&ldquo;I have spent the last three years putting in place structures for the county government and I now want to focus on service delivery in the second term,&rdquo; Oparanya said.Aspirants profiles and promises The governor&rsquo;s main focus has been on road construction, improvement of health facilities and schools, agriculture and employment of the youth through the county Kazi Mashinani programme.The ongoing construction of a Sh6.2 billion Kakamega Teaching and Referral Hospital and the Sh1.2 billion upgrade of Bukhungu Stadium are his flagship projects.Khalwale, a medical doctor, depends on the 248,888 votes he garnered against Cyrus Jirongo&rsquo;s 145,736 votes in the 2013 Senate race to propel his candidacy. He schooled at the Kakamega High School, proceeded to the University of Nairobi, where he graduated with a degree in Medicine in 1981. He joined politics in 1997. Popularly known as The Bullfighter, Khalwale hopes to rely on his anti-corruption crusade in his campaigns against the incumbent. He has promised equitable distribution of resources, ending corruption and improving health services if elected.Anangwe served as Butere MP between 1997 and 2002 in Kanu. He now teaches political science at the University of Dodoma, Tanzania. He holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from the University of Nairobi and a Masters in public policy and administration from the University of Manchester, UK. He did his post-doctoral studies in the American political system at the American University, Washington DC.He has promised to ensure equitable distribution of resources, and public participation in the decision-making process.&ldquo;I will prioritise agriculture since it is the mainstay of the county&rsquo;s economy, and the main source of livelihood. I will help sugarcane farmers grow the crop on their own by heavily subsidising farm inputs and machinery to cut down on the cost of cane growing and increase profits,&rdquo; Anangwe said.He says he will share county resources equally and allow residents to choose their development priorities. Anangwe says he will initiate a youth empowerment programme through the county&rsquo;s Kazi kwa Vijana, which will entail a youth enterprise fund and youth entrepreneurship programmes.Muruli on the other hand will be making a second attempt at having her name on the ballot, after she was barred from vying in 2013 for lack of a degree certificate. She will, however, have to first square it out with Anangwe for the Jubilee ticket.The 54-yea-old now holds a degree in Immigration Law from Brunel University (UK) and is pursuing a Masters in Diplomacy Studies at the London Academy of Diplomacy Studies. She promises to link Kakamega to the rest of the world in business, agriculture, education and women and youth empowerment through her international exposure . &ldquo;My key component in development is economic transformation of this county. I pride myself on the fact that I have robustly networked internationally, with vast experience as an asylum boss in Europe. I stand a better chance to get development cash and foreign direct investment for our county.&rdquo;Senate race The Senate race has so far attracted four candidates &mdash; Mahiakalo MCA Cleophas Malala, Kenya National Union of Nurses secretary general Seth Panyako, former Kanu activist Alex Mukabwa and Stanley Livondo. Khalwale will not defend the seat.What residents sayElly Mukolwe, a resident, says the races for governor and MCAs will be the most competitive.&ldquo;Though Oparanya has his own weaknesses as a person, he has done better compared to other governors in Western, and those seeking to unseat him will have to work very hard,&rdquo; he said.He said Khalwale&rsquo;s activism approach to politics could work against him because people are now of the view that a governor should be a manager.&ldquo;His antagonism style and activism-like approach will not add value to his bid as he has burnt all his bridges,&rdquo; he said.Mukolwe says Anangwe was an ideal candidate but on a wrong party. He says Muruli will have it rough becauseshe was married to a Briton.&ldquo;In Kakamega we&rsquo;ve not reached a point to elect a woman as governor. Remember we have never elected a single female MP before,&rdquo; he added.Charles Okwemba, the director of the ALPHA Support Development Programme in Kakamega, says the race for governor will be intensive because the counties control a lot of money. He has no problems with Oparanya, whom he says has tried his best to develop the county compared to his colleagues.&ldquo;The only problem I have with the county government is that key decisions are made without proper public participation as required by the Constitution,&rdquo; he said.Media analyst Martin Andati says tOparanya has a head start in the race.In his opinion, ODM has fairly well-established structures in Kakamega and that those of the county have been established in the four years Oparanya has been in office.The incumbent, Anangwe and Sumba all come from the Southern bloc, comprising Butere, Khwisero, Mumias East, Mumias West and Matungu constituencies.Khalwale and Muruli are from the Central zone comprising Lurambi, Ikolomani, Shinyalu and Navakholo constituencies.This leaves the Northern bloc that consists Malava, Lugari and Likuyani constituencies, which will most likely provide the swing vote.
