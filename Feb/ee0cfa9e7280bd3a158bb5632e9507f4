The race for Nandi governor has intensified with Senator Stephen Sang taking a jab at a former minister during a church function on Sunday.During the event in Chepterwai, Mosop constituency, Sang accused former Industrialisation minister Henry Kosgey of sidelining the area during his tenure.&ldquo;Mosop did not have a single tarmack road for many years, despite having a minister in power. This only changed when Jubilee took over power,&rdquo; he said.He said he will ensure leases issued to multinationals are reverted to residents once the current terms expire. Sang hinted at Kosgey having interests in some of the multinationals, making him unwilling to push for leases to be transferred to residents.Kosgey denied the claim, saying the tea estates he owns - Kibwari and Kipkeibon - were not grabbed.&ldquo;I have heard people mention tea estates. I will ensure the tea estates are placed in the hands of the Nandi people. I went to London and fought to ensure Siret Tea Estate is returned to the people,&rdquo; he said.Kosgey denied sidelining Mosop when he was minister. Kosgey and Sang will battle it out with incumbent Alex Tolgos for the Jubilee ticket.
