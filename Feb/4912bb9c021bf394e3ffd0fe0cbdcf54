Crops worth more than Sh2 million were on Tuesday night destroyed by 12 elephants which have invaded private farms between Sultan Hamud and Emali on the Mombasa-Nairobi highway. Farmer Paskalina Musyimi said the crops destroyed include water melons, bananas, maize, cabbage and sukuma wiki. Musyimi said the animals will continue to destroy their farms if KWS does not drive them back into the park.The farmers have appealed to KWS officers from their Kiboko and Mashuru offices to ensure the jumbos are taken back, saying they fear for the safety of schoolgoing children. Parents are forced to escort their children to school and pick them afterwards, which is a great task, they said. Last year, jumbos killed three people in Mashuru.
