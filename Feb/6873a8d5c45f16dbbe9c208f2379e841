The Kenya Meat Commission is rescuing livestock farmers by purchasing their emaciated animals in drought-stricken regions.Speaking to the Star in Mombasa yesterday, KMC livestock manager Sylvester Malei said the commission has purchased more than 3,000 livestock in the Coast region since last December.He said the prices are fair and they want farmers to get value for money.Many cattle were from Kilifi, the worst-hit county, and others from Lamu, Tana River and Kwale.Purchase under the Drought Emergency Programme targets weak livestock to relieve farmers of high risks of the drought.Malei said they have mobilised residents of the four counties through the county and national administrations.The KMC set aside Sh170 million for the initiative &mdash; Sh100 million for purchases and the balance for logistics.Malei said the programme helps poor farmers earn a livelihood from livestock sales, instead of letting the livestock succumb. He said the money enables them to pay their children&rsquo;s school fees and get food for survival.Malei said the programme will be extended to Baringo, Marsabit, Laikipia, Isiolo and Turkana counties.&ldquo;We must help farmers to reduce the number of livestock to a size they can manage based on the scarcity of pasture and water,&rdquo; he said.Because of the ravaging drought in the Coast and Northeastern regions, the government has also set aside Sh600 million to buy livestock from Mandera, Wajir, Samburu and Isiolo residents.Malei said the cattle they purchase will be slaughtered at the Kibarani KMC plant. It processes corn-fed beef for the Kenya Defence Forces and the Kenya Wildlife Service.It is shipped to Nairobi for packaging.
