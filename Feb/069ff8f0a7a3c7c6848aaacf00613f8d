A Mombasa court has ordered the reinstatement of two police officers dismissed for allegedly blocking President Uhuru Kenyatta's motorcade.Labour court judge James Rika said the two were unfairly dismissed without being given a fair trial by their bosses.Rika said it was evident that the officers were dismissed while in their line of duty and never intended to put Uhuru's life at risk, Police constable Joel Atuti and corporal Barnaba Ruto were sacked in January 2016 for allegedly blocking Uhuru's motorcade along Sabasaba-Nyali road.They were arrested and remanded for five days after they were denied police bond as proceedings of their cases continued.Shortly after their sacking, Uhuru claimed to have seen the officers taking a bribe.&ldquo;While in Mombasa last week, I witnessed police officers taking a bribe from a PSV,&rdquo; the President said during a conference in South C, Nairobi,His claims were backed by IG Joseph Boinnet who said the two were caught on camera."CCTV footage showed the two cops taking a bribe. They had also parked badly causing huge traffic jam," he said.More on this: Two cops sacked for obstructing Uhuru ' were taking bribe' - BoinnetBut Atuti and Ruto challenged their dismissal, terming them "cooked up" allegations.They said they were driving back to Mtwapa from Tudor, where they had gone to arrest a suspect.The officers said they stopped their vehicle in the middle of the road when they came across a matatu obstructing other motorists.They parked the police vehicle in front of the matatu to arrest the driver for picking passengers at an undesignated area.On arrival at Makupa police station with the matatu driver, Omar Jilo, the officers were disarmed.Jilo denied giving any bribe to the officers when he testified in court.Read: Two officers say charges &lsquo;cooked up&rsquo;Also read: Does President know two cops were sacked?During his ruling, the judge also found no evidence showing that the presidential motorcade was blocked by the officers.Rika said officers who testified revealed there was no prior communication that the motorcade would be using the road, which would require it to be clear of all obstacles.He also noted that the motorcade's driver told the court that he slowed down because of potholes and not because he was blocked by the officers.He noted that two of five vehicles of the motorcade had used the similar road uninterrupted and therefore it was unlikely that they had any bad intentionsRika said former regional police commandant Francis Wanjohi reacted emotionally by dismissing the officers without giving them a fair trial."It is irrational of Wanjohi to have blindly dismissed them and as senior officer should have avoided steer-mongering."Rika further noted that Atuti and Ruto should have been charged before a criminal court for corruption and bribery, instead of the case being heard by individuals in the higher ranks.
