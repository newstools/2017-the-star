Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua has done nothing for Machakos other than invest in power wrangles with his deputy and some MCAs, governor hopeful Wavinya Ndeti has said.The infighting between the governor, Deputy Governor Bernard Kiala and the MCAs has derailed development and the leaders do not deserve a second term, she said.&ldquo;We have wasted a whole term of five years with nothing but infighting. We are now saying that come August 8, all we want in our county is peace and the only person who can bring that peace is Wavinya Ndeti,&rdquo; the aspirant said amidst a big applause from mourners.Ndeti spoke on Thursday during the burial of Mutituni MCA Joseph Kalunde.However, the governor said only a few anti-development leaders have been derailing the county.&ldquo;I have heard some people say that there have been in fights in my administration, but that is not true. The case has only been of some few individuals who have been trying to pull us behind as we try to move forward,&rdquo; Mutua said.He said the county government has performed well, despite working under difficult circumstances.However, the two leaders eulogised Kalunde as an intelligent leader with strong political values and urged residents to elect leaders with such qualities.Kalunde died in Nairobi Hospital on February 13, following an illness.Speaker Bernard Mung&rsquo;ata said he heavily relied on Kalunde to keep peace in the assembly as he was wise and peaceful.&ldquo;Babu, as he was fondly referred to by his fellow county assembly members, always had a joke or a wise word for everyone. Many a time I invited him as an elder to intervene in emotive situations in the assembly,&rdquo; he said.Many MCAs not allied to Mutua did not attend the funeral.
