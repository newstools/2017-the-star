Counties practising FGM have the highest number of maternal deaths related to childbirth.State Department of Gender Affairs PS Zeinab Hussein on Monday cited statistics indicating FGM can be deadly.She said Northeastern leads in FGM at 97 per cent against the country&rsquo;s 21 per cent rate. Hussein spoke in Sankuri in Garissa county during observations marking the International Day of Zero Tolerance for FGM.&ldquo;Only women who have undergone the cut understand the complications they go through during childbirth. This is a cultural practice that we should say no to and save our women from imminent deaths,&rdquo; Hussein said.The PS said FGM was practised in the region before Islam and Christianity were introduced.&ldquo;This is purely a cultural issue that needs to be interrogated, keeping in mind the adverse effects on the health of our child-bearing mothers,&rdquo; she said. Former nominated MP Sophia Abdi said she fought hard during her tenure to ensure the Anti-FGM Act was passed. It was adopted despite immense resistance from her male counterparts, especially those from regions with high FGM rates. &ldquo;It was not easy. Some men told me to my face you cannot legislate culture. It took a lot of convincing to pass the bill,&rdquo; the anti-FGM activist said.
