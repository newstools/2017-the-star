Four men facing drug trafficking related offences in Kenya arrived in the US on Tuesday following their extradition to face drug trafficking charges.The four had been on the US's most wanted list over drug-related offences.The Star learnt that Baktash Akasha, Ibrahim Akasha and two foreigners Vijay Goswami (Indian) and Hussein Gulam (Pakistani) were seen at the Directorate of Criminal Investigation headquarters in Nairobi, despite there being a case challenging their extradition. The case is pending before Justice Njoki Mwangi.Yesterday, their lawyer Cliff Ombeta said he tried in vain to serve an order to the regional police boss and the Criminal Department boss in Mombasa. He said he was denied access.&ldquo;A police officer told me they were not in, despite me hearing voices in the regional police boss office. Five minutes later, I saw the regional DCI&rsquo;s boss official car leaving the police headquarters,&rdquo; he said.But the Director of Public Prosecutions Alexander Muteti said they do not have the suspects, adding that he received the order.He said Ombeta should have produced an affidavit of service.A ruling over whether service was effected was set for yesterday afternoon.Police sources say the four were escorted by head of anti-narcotics Hamisi Massa as they boarded the US-flagged plane &ndash; Omni. It is the same plane which brought in 90 deportees from the US last week.One of the arresting officers from the US Drug Enforcement Administration said two South African witnesses, who led to the arrest of the four in Mombasa on Saturday and Sunday night, played a major role and were to testify in the US.&ldquo;This was a sealed deal. We have been pleading with these witnesses, but they told us they cannot testify in Kenya because they fear for their lives,&rdquo; the sources say.The sources add that one of the foreign suspect arrested with Baktash, and only identified as Paul, was used as a middleman in the purchase of the narcotics. &ldquo;Paul had three bank accounts and a huge amount of money was deposited in his account before it was withdrawn by the four suspects after the purchase of narcotics,&rdquo; the sources say.Police spokesman Charles Owino said for individuals to be extradited, there is a long procedure, which starts from the court and it involves several agencies.&ldquo;We are not aware of the whereabouts of the four suspects,&rdquo; he said.A source at JKIA, who sought anonymity, said the plane was last seen at the airport on Monday afternoon.&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t trace such individuals.They are not checked in on any system. They are normally treated as VIPs,&rdquo; he said.Immigration director Gideon Kihalangwa said he is not aware of any extradition and he has not come across such files in his office. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a court order restricting our clients from leaving the country. If they have been extradited, Coast head of DCI Pius Macharia must explain and be jailed for this,&rdquo; Ombeta said.Early last week, the Mexican government extradited drug lord Joaquin &ldquo;El Chapo&rdquo; Guzman to the US, where he is wanted for drug trafficking and other related charges.On Monday, Ombeta made an application in the lower court to summon Deputy Director of Criminal Investigations Abubakar Maalim and head of anti-terrorism Munga Nyale, saying they know the whereabouts of his clients.Ombeta told chief magistrate Julius Nang&rsquo;ea that Maalim seemed to be the one heading the operation during the arrest of his clients.Ombeta told the court he knew the officers who were carrying out the operation since they have interacted on several occasions. &ldquo;That day I recognised Maalim, Nyale and other junior officers,&rdquo;he said.He told the court he visited all police cells in Mombasa without any success.Maalim informed him of the operation being a serious one and that orders were coming from way above him and that there was nothing they could discuss.
