Kenya boxing chairman Reuben Ndolo on Saturday night almost engaged in a fist fight with State House MC and event organizer Big Ted at the Canivore restaurant. Ted was apparently infuriated by Ndolo&rsquo;s remarks that the boxing game in the country has been neglected by President Uhuru Kenyatta whose focus has only been on rugby. "I respect Ndolo as my uncle but asituletee ujinga kwa kutaja jina ya Uhuru hapa (but let him not bring non sense here by mentioning the president&rsquo;s name)," a visibly furious Ted retorted after the two were separated by match stewards at the boxing arena. Ndolo, who chose to walk away from the melee said: &ldquo;I know Uhuru if you are going to listen to this video, just know Kenya has been and is a boxing nation and we need sponsorship just like football and rugby.&rdquo;The former Makadara MP is a former boxer and a die-hard fanatic of the game. His supporters and those of Ted almost squared it out but were refrained by security. &ldquo;This guy has been in the boxing industry for almost 50 years but what has he done,&rdquo; Ted said.The event, dubbed Making a Champ Boxing and concert series (MAC), saw Kenyan female boxer Fatuma Zarika square it out with Asha Ndegere of Tanzania.Two other bouts were also staged at the event.
