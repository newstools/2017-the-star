Laikipia farmers have accused the government of dragging its feet in resolving conflict pitting ranch owners and herders.An estimated 10,000 pastoralists with 135,000 cattle have invaded ranches in Laikipia North in the past four months.On Thursday last week, the Laikipia Farmers' Association gave the government suggestions on how the conflict can be resolved.&ldquo;Police is ineffective and we can't tell them how to do their job,&rdquo; association chairman Martin Evans told the Star on the phone Sunday.Among the suggestions given was to reinforce police service units.The association also urged Director of Public Prosecutions and Chief Justice to establish a special prosecution unit and mobile courts for speedy legal action against illegal trespassers, individuals with illegal weapons, those who maliciously damage property and illegally move livestock.It also urged Laikipia government to work with neighbouring counties to urgently convene a high-level stakeholders' dialogue to agree on a grazing plan for the county and surroundings.The conflict has been fuelled by scramble for pasture and water due to drought, illegal weapons and politics, which Laikipia North MP Mathew Lempurkel denies.Ranches that continue to be occupied by pastoralists and their cattle in large numbers are Mugie, Suyian and Kifuku.Laikipia Nature Conservancy is also affected.Evans accused some leaders of "telling the residents lies".He said many lives have been lost, property destroyed, businesses hurt and wildlife harmed.The association says it accepts drought is forcing pastoralists across Kenya to make difficult choices to find grazing fields for their livestock.
