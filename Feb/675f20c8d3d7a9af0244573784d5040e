Some Murang&rsquo;a leaders have castigated Governor Mwangi Wairia for claiming the outlawed Mungiki sect is re-emerging.MPs Peter Kamande (Maragua), Jamleck Kamau (Kigumo) and Deputy Governor Gakure Monyo told Wairia to retract his statement that was reflected by several media outlets that the illegal group is spreading its roots again in the county.Speaking at a voter registration rally in Lower Gatanga on Saturday, the three accused Wairia of branding innocent youth who have withdrawn their support for his governor bid.&ldquo;Our youth who have refused to be used by some politicians to cause chaos during this campaign season are now being called names and linked to outlawed sects. We won&rsquo;t allow anyone to force the youth into their dirty ways,&rdquo; Kamau said.Kamau told Wairia to stop peddling propaganda on the re-emergence of the illegal group, saying it amounts to incitement. &ldquo;This is a very serious claim and if he has information about it he should notify security agents,&rdquo; he said.Monyo parted ways with the governor a few months ago after a series of standoffs with the county boss. He said it is wrong for the governor to refer to Murang&rsquo;a youth as members of the outlawed sect.&ldquo;If the governor knows anyone who is affiliated to the gang he should hand them over to the police,&rdquo; Monyo said.The Deputy Governor said Wairia has sensed defeat in the August polls and that is why he is inciting residents by making such remarks.Maragua&rsquo;s Peter Kamande said Wairia&rsquo;s remarks are tailored to cause disunity. He said even President Uhuru Kenyatta said reformed youth who were members of the sect should be given IDs and voter&rsquo;s cards. &ldquo;Our children have gone through a lot of trauma branded as Mungiki. We don&rsquo;t want anyone to cause disunity,&rdquo; he said.
