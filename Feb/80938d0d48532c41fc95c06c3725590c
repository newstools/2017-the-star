"In September last year I was called for co-pilot interviews and was among six people who passed the interview," she said. She said Majiwa asked them to pay Sh2.7 million each in order to attend a special training in South Africa.  "He told us Ruto and Mama Ngina had shares in the company. Being that my uncle introduced me to the company I had no doubt that it was a legitimate company, she said. She said Majiwa was among those who conducted interviews at Weston hotel. "We paid the cash on grounds that on completion of the training in SA we could ask for our claims after investors put in their money," she said. She said while in South Africa in October, Majiwa told them that Prince Rahim of Saudi Arabia had visited Kenya and promised to heavily invest in the airline. Majiwa requested them to deposit some money on his account to activate and ease bank transactions it since the company had not officially opened an account, she said. "It is from here that we started sensing something wrong. All in all we did not deposit the money," she said. On completion of the training, they came back to Kenya and were promised to commence operations in December. She added that after arriving from the training, Majiwa went missing and his phone switched off. A sustained probe by herself and five other trainees revealed that Majiwa had recruited about 6 pilots and 30 cabin crew, a majority of whom had reportedly been sacked by Kenya Airways. Majiwa promised the six prominent jobs within the company's management to silence them after the fraud allegations were made public. He started using them to lure recruits who were also paying large sums of money on grounds that they would be sent to Dubai and Canada for training. "I launched my own investigations and realised that the Baracuda Airways was a scam; it was previously branded as Baracuda holdings before the name was changed," the trainee said. "Further investigations pointed that Prince Rahim rejected the offer to invest in the company after he realised that the company had not acquired even a single plane," she added. She says that she and the other five trainees were issued with termination letters allegedly because word got back to Majiwa of their investigations into the company The company reportedly has an air service license from Kenya Civil Aviation Authority, which is used to defraud innocent Kenyans. It is said Majiwa has powerful connections, including prominent people in the government. His is linked with defrauding Weston Hotel, owned by the Deputy President, of over Sh56 million after conducting two-weeks training session for some of the cabin crew members. By Saturday evening, Weston Hotel had not made an official statement. Another hotel by the name Dove in Naivasha has also reportedly fallen victim. Majiwa is said to have conducted several retreats at Dove for his staff and issued them bouncing cheques. More than 15 people have recorded statements and issued critical evidence against Majiwa.
