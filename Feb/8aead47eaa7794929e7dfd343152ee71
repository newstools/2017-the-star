Nairobi county government has expressed concern over the number of patients shunning public dispensaries and health centres despite the presence of clinical officers and nurses.Health executive Bernard Muia said the number of patients seeking treatment at level 2 and 3 facilities has decreased by 30 per cent, despite them having personnel and drugs."Facilities are not being utilised because of the perception that there are no service providers," he said on Tuesday.Read: Clinical officers suspend their strike, urge members to resume workHe said more than 80 per cent of ailments are treated at health centres, while the remaining services and cases are referral and are cases where doctors are needed."Most of the people in the city have a perception that only Kenyatta National Hospital offers services, not knowing they can get treatment early from our health centres. The more they stay home the more they get critical," Muia said.The doctors strike, which is in its 65th day, is believed to have paralysed health services countrywide.But Muia said the centres are well-equipped with drugs worth Sh268 million supplied by the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority.The Health executive asked striking doctors to resume work."Once (doctors) reach an agreement and a deal is signed, they will be paid all their arrears. But they will not reverse deaths that occurred while they were away," he said.He noted that health services have not been badly affected by the strike as private and health-based facilities are attending to patients.He said no cases of death due to the strike have been reported in the city since the medics downed their tools on December 5.
