Giant telecoms operator, Safaricom, voiced "strong reservations" on Friday over the regulator's plan to monitor mobile phones on networks to detect counterfeits.The Communications Authority of Kenya wants to install equipment in the networks of the three mobile operators-Safaricom, Airtel and Telkom Kenya, to improve its monitoring of counterfeit mobiles, in line with its consumer protection mandate.Poorly made counterfeit phones, imported mainly from Asia, are prevalent in many African nations and regulators say they are widely used by criminals because they are difficult to track.Safaricom, which is 40 per cent owned by Britain's Vodafone , is concerned the monitoring devices will give the regulator access to other customer data including calls, messages and financial transactions."We have registered our strong reservations about this and especially the need to have this system subjected to the relevant public debate as it touches on confidential communications belonging to our customers," Stephen Chege, Safaricom's corporate affairs director, told Reuters.The regulator has switched off counterfeit mobiles in the past, but it says consumers are still exposed to such devices, hence the need for a better monitoring system. The CAK on Friday denied media reports that it plans to tap private data of mobile phone users.The CA director general Francis Wangusi said the newly acquired Device Management System does not have the ability to gain access to information on mobile devices, including details on subscribers&rsquo; communications such as voice calls, SMS,as well as mobile money transactions.He said the acquisition of a DMS is the second phase of the initial initiative that saw Mobile Network Operators switch off all counterfeit mobile devices in Kenya in 2010.
