Swamibapa and Stray Lions will renew their rivalry tomorrow in a battle of leaders when they face off in the second leg of the 2017 NPCA Twenty20 Cup at Nairobi Jafferys.Local supporters will be looking to see if Stray Lions&rsquo; will extend their winning run to four matches in a row over the defending champions. From nine rounds of matches, Stray Lions top the log with 42 points followed by Swamis, who have 34 points from same number of matches.In the first round, Stray Lions took advantage of Swamibapa&rsquo;s inconsistency with the bat to win the match by 16 runs and start favourites in tomorrow&rsquo;s match. With the reigning champions Swamibapa having put on some impressive shows since losing at Peponi, most cricket followers expect them to give as much as they will receive in today&rsquo;s duel. Confidence is high in both camps after they won their respective matches last weekend. Swamibapa skipper Maurice Ouma said they will not take their foot off the gas when they host the leaders. &ldquo;Whether we are playing Cutchi Leva, Kanbis or Stray Lions, we have to continue with our good form,&rdquo; Ouma said.Stray Lions wicket keeper Abraham Vadada also quashed any suggestion that the team would be holding back with their knockout stages spot almost guaranteed.Stray Lions are set to be without opening bowler Wilkin Mota, who has left for India. Mota played a key role in the three wins which Lions registered against Swamibapa.His place will, however, be filled by Ugandan opening bowler Charles Waiswa, who is equally good with the ball. Vadada said considering the home ground advantage, Swamis are likely to pull a shocker especially after bowling out Kanbis for 85 last weekend. &ldquo;In the T20 format, any team can win on a given day but if I am to single out favourites for today&rsquo;s match, I would give it to Swamis,&rdquo; he said, adding: &ldquo;They are currently enjoying too form and a lot of their players are experienced.&rdquo;Maurice Odumbe, who was the star in the first leg encounter by claiming 4 for 9 is expected to make a comeback in the match after missing last weekend matches against Kongonis and Cutchi Leva.Fixtures: Today (2:30pm) : Sikh Union v Stray Lions (Sikh Union), Gymkhana v Kanbis (Gymkhana), Cutchi Leva v Kongonis (Samaj School), Ruaraka v Swamibapa (Ruaraka); Tomorrow (9.30am): Swamibapa v Stray Lions (Jafferys), Ruaraka v Cutchi Leva (Ruaraka), Kongonis v Gymkhana (Nairobi Club), Kanbis v Sikh Union (Eastleigh High)
