Tens of athletes and residents on Wednesday held protests in Nyeri town against a move by the Agricultural Society of Kenya to block the upgrade of Ruring&rsquo;u Stadium.The protestors waved placards, blared horns and blew vuvuzelas while marching on Nyeri town streets. They blocked major roads, saying ASK must allow for the development of the stadium.The stadium has been idle following a title deed row between ASK and the Nyeri county government.The 10-acre stadium where ASK used to hold the agricultural show is in Ruring&rsquo;u. The county gave the society a 100 acres in Kabiruini where it has been holding its events but still refused to part with the title deed.The county handed over the stadium to Sports Kenya, who is expected to upgrade it to international standards at the cost of Sh250 million. A fortnight ago, during the occasion to hand over the stadium to the contractor, Nyeri Deputy Governor Samuel Wamathai said this was the President&rsquo;s directive.Wamathai said the stadium will be among the seven national stadia promised by the Jubilee government.&ldquo;The long standoff between the ASK and the county has been resolved,&rdquo; the deputy governor said.Wamathai said those living around the stadium must be evacuated. It will be the venue for football, volleyball, basket ball, rugby, hockey, athletics and swimming.The stadium will be built in two phases. It will have two main areas for training and for playing. However, the ASK moved to court recently and obtained orders to block any construction until the matter is heard and determined.On Wednesday, the residents asked the ASK to withdraw the case and let the contractor go ahead with construction.&ldquo;Our youth will engage in drugs since there are no facilities to improve their talents. We have collected 500 signatures of petitioners to be enjoined in the case,&rdquo; said Mbaka Kiama.Athlete Paul Maina urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to intervene until the matter is resolved, adding that there is a need for a permanent solution.
