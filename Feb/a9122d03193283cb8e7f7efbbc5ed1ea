The IEBC has heaped blame on elected leaders from Nyanza over the voter listing apathy. Regional IEBC coordinator George Oyugi accused MPs and MCAs of showing little interest in increasing the number of new voters. Oyugi (pictured) said no single MP has visited his office to verify how the registration drive was on going, despite Cord leader Raila Odinga having raised a red flag on the dismal performance in the region. He spoke on Thursday in Siaya county.
