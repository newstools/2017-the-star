More than Sh24 billion is needed to cater for those areas worst-hit by drought, the government announced yesterday.State House spokesperson Manoah Esipisu (pictured) said the government has secured Sh7.1 billion and spent Sh5.4 billion in phase one of the drought intervention that ended last month.He said Sh11.6 billion is required for the second phase, which covers February to April. Phase three, which covers April-August, requires Sh7.1 billion.This comes two weeks after the government declared drought a national disaster and called on donors to help in mitigation efforts. &ldquo;Fifty per cent of the mitigation is through cash transfers so that the recipients can decide on what to buy,&rdquo; Esipisu said.He said the drought has caused a 10-20 per cent food prices increase, above the annual average. Esipisu said about 3 million people in 23 counties have been affected by the drought.Responding to why the government has not learnt from past droughts and come up with sustainable programmes, he said this year&rsquo;s situation had been well-managed, compared that of 2011.On Ethiopia&rsquo;s plantations and construction of the Gibe Dam on the River Nile that is a cause of receding waters at Lake Turkana, Esipisu said the government is engaging its Addis Ababa counterpart. He, however, did not divulge details nor the level of engagements. The Ethiopian Embassy in Nairobi has dismissed claims the projects are being implemented without putting in place necessary mitigation measures and without Kenya&rsquo;s involvement.
