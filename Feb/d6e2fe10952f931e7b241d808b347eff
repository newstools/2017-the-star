Governor James Ongwae (pictured) yesterday said his administration has done a lot in three years. He asked his rivals to sell their own policies instead of peddling lies that his administration has done little since he took office. &ldquo;You should ask them what new things they will do for you that I have not done,&rdquo; Ongwae said. He was speaking in South Mugirango during a voter registration drive. Ongwae was accompanied by nominated Senator Janet Ong&rsquo;era and county assembly speaker Kerosi OndiekiHe urged residents to register before February 14. &ldquo;As you are aware the registration exercise, which started last month, will end in a week&rsquo;s time. It&rsquo;s important for you not to wait until the last day, as is the norm, to register,&rdquo; Ongwae said. Ong&rsquo;era said Kenya&rsquo;s future will be determined through a free, fair and transparent election. &ldquo;You need to avoid the last-minute rush to register as voters. You need to spare your time to visit the nearest registration centre to register,&rdquo; she said.
