A Ugandan national appeared before a Mombasa court after attempting to register as a Kenyan voter.Walukaga Jalaldin and his co-accused Lucas Odundo denied faking documents to enable Jaladin obtain a Kenyan ID. Oundo is accused of pretending to be Jaladin's father to enable him acquire a Kenyan identity card by the name Salim Jalal Okungu.They are said to have committed the offence on October 19, 2016 at the chief Registrar of Persons office in Ganjoni, Mombasa county.The fake ID cards were produced in court as evidence.But the accused said the information they had given to obtain the ID cards were not false."I used to be a Ugandan citizen but also obtained a Kenyan citizenship and that makes me a Kenyan as per the law," Jalaldin told the court on Monday.He said as a Kenyan he has the right to obtain an ID card to register as a voter ahead of the August 8 polls.The accused also argued that they are entitled to bail pending hearing and determination of the matter.Chief magistrate Julius Nang'ea released them on a Sh500,000 bond each, with a similar surety or a cash bail of Sh300,000 each.The matter will be mentioned on February 27.
