Billionaire businessman Bundotich Kiprop, popularly known as Buzeki has accused Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago of desperately perpetuating tribal politics.Buzeki, himself a Uasin Gishu governor hopeful, told the Kalenjin Council of Elders on Tuesday to stop being used by Mandago to push a tribal agenda. He said the elders must apologise for trying to block him and other leaders from running on grounds of their subtribes. &ldquo;This subtribe agenda being pushed by the incumbent is one man&rsquo;s thinking. He is trying to impose on others to buy his narrow-minded agenda that can&rsquo;t work. I will always seek to extend my unity agenda to all the people of Uasin Gishu,&rdquo; Buzeki said. He was responding to a decision by elders two weeks ago to propose that political seats be shared out based on constituencies. The elders, led by Rtd Major John Seii, suggested that the governor seat remain in Eldoret North, the Senate seat go to Eldoret East and the woman MP be from Eldoret South.
