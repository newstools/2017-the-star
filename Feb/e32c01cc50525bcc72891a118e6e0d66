Jubilee Party members defectors citing the possibility of unfair nominations are only scared of losing, secretariat chief Raphael Tuju has said.&ldquo;Any aspirant saying nominations will not be free and fair is jumping the gun. We do not even have a National Elections Board yet. We are waiting to complete the voter registration drive,&rdquo; he said on Monday.Tuju added, &ldquo;Aspirants crying wolf about the process have other reasons for wanting to defect.&rdquo; He spoke in Kiambu town after meeting aspirants to urge them to mobilise residents to vote. Elected MPs, the governor, senator and woman representative snubbed the meeting.Tuju said the party is in discussions with the IEBC to supervise nominations. He said JP will treat aspirants and incumbents equally, adding that everyone will be involved in choosing interim party officials.&ldquo;In many respects, sitting MPs tend to be the face of a party. But JP has made sure aspirants have a say in choosing interim officials across the country. No other party has given that kind of chance to aspirants,&rdquo; Tuju said.Some aspirants have expressed fears of skewed primaries.&ldquo;We are all seeking positions, but incumbents are acting as if they own the party and are the preferred candidates. The playing field is not level. We sense a bigger plot to rig nominations,&rdquo; Githunguri MP aspirant Stephen Kinuthia said.Tuju said JP has no mandate to stop the mass transfer of voters. He said every Kenyan has a right to vote wherever they want.Branch JP interim official Mwangi Gofia said, &ldquo;We are going door-to-door to mobilize people to register as voters. We are sure that by February 14, we should have registered more than 300,000 voters.&rdquo;The IEBC targets to register 500,000 voters. Only about 100,000 people have been listed.
