Cheruiyot said Simani would be culpable. Abdullahi was under Simani&rsquo;s supervision as he practised for two years. &ldquo;If the deceased lawyer had not taken out a practising certificate from the LSK to give him the mandate to legally supervise Abdullahi, then the latter should not be blamed. It&rsquo;s the late Simani who should be held responsible,&rdquo; the magistrate ruled.The Directorate of Criminal Investigations had filed an application seeking orders to probe Abdullahi&rsquo;s certificate, saying there was information he does not qualify to be lawyer.The magistrate said even before the swearing in of Abdullahi, all his certificates had been verified and his name gazetted before being admitted into the roll of advocates by the Chief Justice.anomaly would have been detected&ldquo;If there was any anomaly in the certificates, it would have been detected during verification, before being sworn in,&rdquo; Cheruiyot ruled.In May last year, Nairobi lawyer Nelson Havi petitioned the LSK to remove Abdullahi from the roll of advocates and strip him of his Senior Counsel title.He accused Abdullahi of professional misconduct over alleged influence of court decisions and using his position in the Judicial Service Commission for personal interests.
