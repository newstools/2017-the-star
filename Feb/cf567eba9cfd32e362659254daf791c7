Some Jubilee Party aspirants in the Rift Valley have opposed the use of smart cards to recruit members who will participate in nominations. On Saturday, Geoffrey Lipale and John Murpus led aspirants in West Pokot who complained that the cards will lock out the majority of residents. &ldquo;Almost half of Kenyans do not have mobile phones and hence cannot use the smart cards,&rdquo; Murpus said. Lipale said, &ldquo;Only 30 per cent of residents of West Pokot have phones and the rest 70 per cent will not be able to register as members.&rdquo; John Sang from Nandi said the smart card would complicate nominations. The smart card was launched on January 13. Jubilee has distributed more than four million smart cards and plans to deliver five million more this week. Separately, JP North Rift coordinator David Koech said they are progressing well with plans for fair nominations.
