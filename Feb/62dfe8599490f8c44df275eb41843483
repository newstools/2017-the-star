The government has set aside Sh100 million to tame the fall army worm, whose outbreak has been confirmed in Uganda. Agriculture PS Richard Lesiyampe said yesterday the government has deployed surveillance teams along the Kenya-Uganda border to monitor any possibility of the worm&rsquo;s presence.&ldquo;We are aware of the emergence of the army worm in Uganda, which was reported last month. The government has taken precautionary measures to avoid spread. Once it is identified in Kenya, it will be easier to deal with,&rdquo; he said. Speaking to the Star on the phone, Lesiyampe said though the pest has not been reported in the country, Kenyan and Ugandan governments are working together to stop further spread.The army worm was first spotted in Africa last year across pockets of West Africa, before extensively invading fields in Southern Africa. It has also been identified in parts of Togo, Nigeria, Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe.The worm is native to the tropical regions of Western Hemisphere from the Unites States to Central America and in the Caribbean to Brazil.
