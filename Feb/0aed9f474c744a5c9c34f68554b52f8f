An IEBC official in Budalang&rsquo;i, Bunyala subcounty, has accused local politicians of fueling chaos since voter registration started.Speaking to the Star at Bunyala subcounty headquarters on Thursday, Budalang&rsquo;i IEBC coordinator Juma Mugwanga faulted the local politicians for ignoring his appeal to meet him to celebrate the success of the voter registration.Mugwanga said instead of respecting his request, political youth groups have been formed purposely to cause mayhem. The IEBC&rsquo;s target of 10,424 has not been achieved. The IEBC official said the commission&rsquo;s biggest challenge is the formation of a group of goons who storm registration centres to bar people from outside Busia county from registering.
