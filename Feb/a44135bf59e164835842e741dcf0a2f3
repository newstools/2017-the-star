Knut Nandi branch secretary Josephat Serem (pictured) yesterday withdrew from the Mosop MP race and backed incumbent Kirwa Stephen Bitok. Both come from Sang&rsquo;alo. &ldquo;Everybody knows had offered myself to run for Mosop parliamentary seat. After thinking deeply, I will not vie but will instead support Bitok,&rdquo; Serem said at the Sang&rsquo;alo Central Primary School.
