The family of Kwale Senator Juma Boy has picked his younger brother Issah Juma to succeed him.Issah was endorsed a week after the death of the senator.Boy was first elected Kwale Central MP in 1983 after the death of his father.Kwale leaders, including Msambweni MP Suleiman Dori, speaker Sammy Ruwa and several MCAs supported Issah.Speaking in Gasi village yesterday, the leaders and the family members vowed to retain the seat in the election.Boy's family spokesperson Juma Buhiri said they picked Issa after a meeting with ODM leaders.He will run on an ODM ticket.Issah will, however, have to battle it out with other candidates since ODM has maintained the seat is not for inheritance.Buhiri said the family will remain focused and committed to the opposition party, just like their brother.Issah, is not new to politics as he vied for Matuga MP in 2007 on a Kadu Asili ticket but failed.&ldquo;I'm ready to follow the footsteps of my brother and be loyal to the party and citizens,&rdquo; he said.Msambweni MP Suleiman Dori asked ODM leaders to give a special consideration to the new entrant.He said this is the only way to give Boy a good send off.&ldquo;Because Boy stood with the party and fought for it, we ask our party leaders to give the family a special consideration,&rdquo; Dori said.He said it is not the first time for family members to succeed those their departed relatives.&ldquo;We are not the first people to ask for this, we have seen it happen everywhere when family members are given priority,&rdquo; Dori said.Kwale ODM organising secretary Benjamin Tayari said their next agenda is to take the nominee to the people.&ldquo;We are not ready to lose this seat. We know there are people from Jubilee who are aspiring,&rdquo; Tiwi MCA Omar Mwakwambirizwa said. He said, however, all those willing to face Issah should come out and convince the electorate.ODM nominated MCA Fatuma Mwajirani said they will do everything possible to retain the seat.
