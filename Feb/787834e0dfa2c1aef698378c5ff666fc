Murang&rsquo;a woman representative Sabina Chege has urged the government to ban betting to save the youth.She said on Tuesday the many betting platforms in Kenya make the youths lazy as they seek to make easy money.Chege said college and university students gamble with school fees and parents are forced to look for more money to keep them in school.She said betting companies make gambling look easy and seem like the quickest way to get rich. Chege said this discourages young people from working hard to earn their own money and invest in income-generating activities.&ldquo;Shops have been closed as owners make losses after using their proceeds in betting,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;This could seriously affect the economy if the government does not control it with urgency.&rdquo;Chege said betting firms should tell the public how much money they make, since many people wallow in poverty after losing their money to them.&ldquo;These companies end up making millions of shillings in profits and then they announce just one winner to keep Kenyans hooked on trying their luck,&rdquo; the legislator said.She said youths must understand that wealth does not come instantly, but through hard work and efficient planning.Chege supported the Betting, Lotteries and Gaming Amendment Bill introduced by Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo. It seeks to control betting and was tabled in the National Assembly on December 1 last year.The bill will be scrutinised by the Labour and Social Welfare Committee chaired by Matungu MP David Were.Chege urged the youth to pursue constructive ventures. She said there is a shortage of technical skills, such as plumbing, electrical, masonry and carpentry, and the youth can exploit such areas.
