Contractors who do not complete projects on time will have their contracts cancelled, Water PS Fred Segor has said. He spoke on Monday after inspecting the Chemususu Dam in Eldama Ravine.&ldquo;Contractors implementing water projects in Kenya have been urged to adhere to timeliness and quality as stipulated in their agreements to enable government meet aspirations of its residents in regard to water provision,&rdquo; Segor said.He said construction of the treatment work station at Chemususu dam is six months behind schedule. Segor said the second phase of the dam should be 16 per cent done but it is at 10 per cent."The contractor needs to up his game [and] hasten the pace so that work is always on schedule," he said.Segor gave the contractor two weeks to rehabilitate the old pipeline to supply more water to Eldama Ravine town."Part of the contractual works in the Chemususu (phase two) project includes the rehabilitation of the old pipeline to supply 6,500 cubic metres of water. He has managed to up it to 2,500 from 1,500,&rdquo; he said.The project is expected to be completed in 18 months.Segor was accompanied by Baringo Governor Benjamin Cheboi. He said the ministry has invested heavily in construction of water storage infrastructure, key among them dams.Cheboi said, &ldquo;Blockage of the piping system due to deposits of manganese has been a major cause of water shortage in Eldama ravine town. Construction of dams and other water harvesting facilities is our priority as far as improving the consistent supply of water to Kenyans is concerned."Segor urged residents to use the available water sparingly and for domestic purposes as the drought continues."Irrigated agriculture is the way to go, but those practising it now upstream need to halt their activities until the onset of rains to allow others access to water during this dry season," he said.
