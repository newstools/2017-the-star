Trans Nzoia Governor Patrick Khaemba (pictured) will retain Deputy Governor Stanley Tarus as his running mate, despite calls to select someone from another community. While touring Cherangany constituency, where Tarus comes from, Khaemba asked residents to reelect him in August. He urged them to elect Tarus governor in 2022.
