With support from World Bank&rsquo;s InfoDev the organization is seeking partner firms in the country to take sponsorship packages ranging from Sh500,000 to Sh5 million. &ldquo;We are trying to help the private sector in Kenya to look at climate change not as a threat but as an opportunity to engage in the right way through investment in order to benefit from it,&rdquo; KCIC CEO Edward Mungai said. KCIC through a specialised fund awards up to Sh5 million to small and medium enterprises geared towards creating innovative solutions in renewable energy, agribusiness and water. The financing goes towards actualising concepts and proposals.
