Nairobi governor aspirant Bishop Margaret Wanjiru has said she will decentralise the county Fire Department and ensure branches in all high-risk areas.She said she will also work with Kenya Power to ensure all slum dwellers get proper and safe electricity connections.&ldquo;Most residents use illegal connections which are usually the cause of fire outbreaks,&rdquo; Wanjiru said.She spoke in Korogocho at the weekend when she visited families rendered homeless by a fire that razed 30 houses.The cause of the fire is yet to be established. The County Fire Department did not arrive in time to help put out the fire and residents complained that firefighters always arrive when it is too late.Wanjiru gave the residents money for food and blankets. The families asked leaders and well-wishers to donate food, clothing and building materials.
