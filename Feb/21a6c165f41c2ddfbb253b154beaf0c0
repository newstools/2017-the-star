Scientists have for the first time revealed the face of the patron saint of lovers, who paid a heavy price for his defence of romance 1,700 years ago.Experts in Brazil have revealed what Saint Valentine looked like, using state-of-the-art 3D interactive technology after studying the ancient holy man's skull.His remains were digitally mapped and his face reconstructed by one of the country's leading computer graphic designers, Cicero Moraes, using 3D interactive technology.The unveiling is timely, as it comes a day before millions of people across the globe celebrate the modern-day love fest in his name.The saint's relic, which is kept in the Basilica of Santa Maria of Cosmedin, in Rome, was photographed by Jos&eacute; Lu&iacute;s Lira, a researcher and religious writer, and analysed by forensic anthropologist, Dr Marcos Paulo Salles Machado.He concluded the head "belonged to a European male aged around 55 years or more".Despite limited access to the skull - which is kept in a tiny glass reliquary in the church and coronated with a crown of flowers - the researchers claim to have produced the first authentic likeness of the third century Roman bishop.The MailOnline has been given exclusive access to the results of the 3D reconstruction, which shows how a series of photographs led to the digital rebuilding of the characteristics of the centuries-old face.From the anatomical laying of soft tissue and muscle, to pigmentating skin tone and sculpting the features, the final result depicts a white haired, bearded benevolent-looking man.He is dressed in a tunic, the official liturgical robes of a priest of the time. The red represents his martyrdom,Moraes, who is based in Sinop, west central Brazil, specialises in recreating the lifelike images of saints and has worked on the 3D face reconstruction of over 10 Roman Catholic holy people.He said: 'This has been an exciting, complicated and rare project to do. It's not often that you get access to a precious and suitably relevant relic like this. We were fortunate to be in the right place at the right time.'We worked on this project for three months and unveiling St Valentine's face now, is a timely reminder of why this dedicated day of affection first started."Our work also gives the world a visual reference of who we should be thanking for the celebration," he added.Getting access to St Valentine's skull came through an unexpected turn of events for the researchers.Lira, who is also president of the Brazilian Academy of Hagiology (a study of the saints) has worked with Moraes on the reconstruction of the faces of Mary Magdalene and Saint Pauline of Brazil, among others.He was in Rome last October on a separate project when he stumbled across the opportunity."I was in St. Peter's Square when one of the many sellers there gave me a picture of St Valentine," recalled Lira, who is normally based in Cear&aacute;, north east Brazil."I took it as a sign to see if I could get unthinkable, close up access to the skull in the Basilica. The chance to do the facial reconstruction of one of the Roman Catholic church's most important and venerated relics has been a life-long dream," he said.
