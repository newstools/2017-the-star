Speed bumps were erected on the Thika Superhighway to keep pedestrians safe, since footbridges are ineffective and too far apart, City Hall said yesterday.&ldquo;The footbridges are not enough,&rdquo; Transport executive Mohamed Abdullahi told the Star on the phone.The High Court on Tuesday ordered the county government to remove bumps and rumble strips on the highway within 60 days.But Abdullahi said he has not been served with the order. &ldquo;We will scrutinise the order and make a decision after receiving it,&rdquo; he said.Thika Superhighway is among the roads with the highest number of accidents in the capital. Most pedestrians shun footbridges and cross roads at unauthorised points, leading to a high number of deaths.However, the number of pedestrians killed on the country&rsquo;s roads last year declined by 20 per cent. Nairobi accounted for 62 per cent of the drop, after NTSA erected crossing barriers on high-risk roads.no rationaleOn Monday, Justice George Odunga ordered City Hall to remove the white strips at Survey of Kenya, Homeland and Kenya Breweries.He directed the NTSA to ensure pedestrians use footbridges. Odunga ordered the Transport CS and county to appoint in 60 days a City Manager and establish the Nairobi City County Management Board.Their work will be to reduce road congestion, as stated in the first schedule of the Urban Areas and Cities Act.In April 2015, Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko sued the county for closing roundabouts and erecting bumps. He said the bumps and rumble strips cause unnecessary traffic jams.Odunga agreed with Sonko that there is no rationale for erecting them when there are footbridges. He said it is the responsibility of the executive to ensure pedestrians use footbridges and to keep them safe.
