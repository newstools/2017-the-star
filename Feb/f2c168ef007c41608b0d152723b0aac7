Vivo Energy has reopened its petrol station in Naivasha after an altercation that saw Nominated Senator Paul Njoroge brandish a gun.The company reopened the station in Karai on Wednesday, following a court order that barred Njoroge from carrying out any activities.Motorists and motorcycle operators were treated to a &lsquo;happy-hour&rsquo; that saw them get free fuel worth Sh1,000.The Senator, who showed up with police, was barred from accessing the facility to reclaim his personal effects.He wanted to collect documents and other items but was turned away by management, and asked to follow the legal process as the business was placed under new management.&ldquo;We have an inventory of all the goods and personal effects in the petrol station. The Senator will get them through the court,&rdquo; said one of the managers who declined to give his name.The Senator, who represents the disabled, said he had not been to the location since the gun drama took place last week.&ldquo;I learnt that the petrol station has been handed over to another dealer. I had gone to check on some of my goods but was turned away,&rdquo; he said.Njoroge said he was surprised that the station was under new management yet a court was still handling the matter.He said he will sue Vivo Energy for ignoring a court order and breaching a legal contract.The Senator confirmed that he had recorded a statement at Naivasha police station.A senior police officer who declined to be named said he also lodged a complaint.&ldquo;The Senator claims in his statement that he left fuel and other property worth millions of shillings but has been denied access to retrieve them,&rdquo; said the officer.Njoroge clashed with Vivo managing director Polycarp Igathe and shot in the air to stop workers from closing down the station last Tuesday.The oil company sent representatives to close the station located along Nairobi-Nakuru highway, saying the Senator failed to adhere to some rules.Njoroge engaged the workers in a heated argument but some continued with the demolition, forcing him to fire.An irate and emotional Njoroge blamed business rivalry for the incident, adding that he complied with all regulations."I paid Sh2.5 million to Vivo and I have insurance of Sh6 million. The fuel company decided to ignore a court order," he said.He spent that night at Naivasha police station after his gun was confiscated and was charged with causing disturbance.He denied the charged and was released on Sh100,000 bond. The case will be heard on April 17.[VIDEO] Gun drama as Senator Njoroge shoots at workers seizing his fuel stationRead: Senator Njoroge charged with causing disturbance after gun drama
