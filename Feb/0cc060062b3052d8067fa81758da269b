After the murder, the principal&rsquo;s widow Jane Muthoni and her accomplice switched off their phones, he said.Kariuki told the court he had second thoughts about killing Mwangi, but he went through with it after the principal&rsquo;s widow insisted.&ldquo;I am scared every time I remember the death of the principal. I was motivated by money and I did not look at the man as he died, which still haunts me,&rdquo; he said.Muthoni and Isaack Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a have denied murdering Mwangi. They are accused of killing him between November 6 and November 11, 2016, in a coffee plantation in Juja.Their cases will be mentioned on March 2, while the hearing is set for May 8.Kariuki&rsquo;s lawyer John Kamau told the court his client has apologised to the principal&rsquo;s family and his plea agreement to manslaughter came from the heart.Cooperated with policeThe lawyer said Kariuki voluntarily cooperated with the police and the prosecution to solve the case and led them to the real culprits.&ldquo;He has a young family and is the sole breadwinner and wishes he could one day go back to them,&rdquo; Kamau said.Mwangi&rsquo;s family representative Fr Gerishon Kuria said they have left it to the court to decide on sentencing, since he cooperated with investigators.&ldquo;Through the accused the family came to know what happened and what the family wanted to know is answered and part of the healing process. We, as a family, would not want to constrain the court on its decision of sentencing the accused,&rdquo; he said.Lawyer Wokabi Mathenge said the family appreciates the information Kariuki gave and would want the law to take its course.Judge Ngugi asked prosecutor Catherine Mwaniki to advise the court to a preferable sentence, and the prosecution said Kariuki should be jailed a maximum of five years.&ldquo;The accused should be treated as a first offender who has also agreed to be a prosecution witness,&rdquo; Mwaniki said.
