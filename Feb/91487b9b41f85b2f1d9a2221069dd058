Preparations for the election are on track, the IEBC has said.The electoral agency sought to allay fears that court cases will disrupt timelines.The IEBC will award the tender for election technology in a week to allow for the setting up of the system for voter verification slated for April.IEBC chairperson Wafula Chebukati (pictured) on Tuesday said procurement is on schedule and the system will be up and running by May 28.&ldquo;We have challenges on the issue of procurement, but the Kenya Integrated Management System procurement is ongoing,&rdquo; he said.Chebukati added, &ldquo;We know we have challenges, but they are not going to stop us from carrying out the August 8 general election. The commission is within its timelines and I want to assure the country there is no need to panic.&rdquo;Ten companies being considered for the tender include France-based Morpho, which supplied BVR kits for the 2013 election.Others are Amsterdam&rsquo;s Gemalto, American firm Avante, South Africa&rsquo;s Lithotech, Ghanaian company SuperTech Ltd, and Singapore&rsquo;s Novus Technologies.Also in the race is a local firm, Compulynx, South Africa&rsquo;s Bigradap Group, and Spanish firm Indra.Chebukati said the commission is still engaging the parties that went to court to block KPMG from auditing the voter&rsquo;s register.&ldquo;The court issued an order against the company which won the tender to proceed so we cannot proceed. However, we were approached by the parties in court and we are holding meetings with a view to settling the matter and hope that will be done very soon,&rdquo; he said.The IEBC has decided to readvertise the tender for ballot papers cancelled by the court after the opposition and a bidder went to court.The judgement gave the commission an option of starting the procurement afresh.
