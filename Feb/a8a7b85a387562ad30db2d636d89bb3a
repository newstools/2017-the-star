Some 15 families whose houses were demolished in November last year by a private developer in Kivingoni settlement scheme, Ndalani, are still living in fear, four months later.They said they continue to receive threatening messages from unidentified people who want them to leave the land.The families said they have lived there for more than 42 years.&ldquo;Since that night when our houses were brought down by hired youths guarded by police, we have never had peace here. We have been receiving threatening messages and our children are even traumatised because they keep screaming every time they see or hear a vehicle coming,&rdquo; resident Veronica Mutua said. The residents spoke yesterday when Yatta MP Francis Mwangangi visited the area to console the families and give some food.Mwangangi said he has petitioned the National Assembly to look into the matter and ensure the residents get title deeds.
