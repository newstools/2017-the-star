A businesswoman has taken it upon herself to ensure the physically disabled, elderly and hunger-striken residents in Samburu West constituency register as voters in IEBC's ongoing Mass Voter Registration.Margaret Wambui, known as Mwishomwisho, has been using her car to transport affected residents to IEBC voter registration centres and back to their homes."Though it is a constitutional right, I realised most Samburu residents cannot make it due to disability or hunger," she told journalists in Saturday.Wambui said she made the effort after media reports that the region was experiencing low voter registration turnout as a result of drought."It is not human to ask people to visit registration centres when they don't even have food for their children at home," she said.Read: Hungry Samburu residents eat wild fruit, wait for relief foodThe trained lawyer has also been providing food stuffs worth Sh500, including maize flour, sugar and tea leaves, as an appreciation gift to each newly-registered voter.Residents have lauded Wambui saying she is not only putting a meal on the table for the less privileged, she is also enabling them exercise their constitutional right."She has gone to people in remote area [and] is transporting disabled people to nearby voter registration centres to list themselves and confirm their details," Jamaa Letipo, a resident, said."This is very useful to the community if we find leaders like her, we will be very successful," Letipo added.Esther Lengolosio said, "I cannot risk falling down queuing to be registered as a voter yet there is no food for my children at home. I thank God for that woman because I am not a registered voter and will have a meal from her when I reach home." With less than two weeks remaining, only 3,000 voters have been registered in Samburu west constituency out of the 12,000 targeted. As the February 14 deadline approaches, IEBC has only managed to list 7,000 voters out of the targetted 25,000 in the county.A number of elected political leaders led by Samburu West MP Lati Lelelit recently asked IEBC to extend the voter registration exercise by another 30 days in drought hit areas to factor in herders who have been forced out of the county.Lelelit said that Samburu leaders are using their own resources to bring back residents who had moved to other places so that they can be registered as voters.More on this: Extend mass voter registration by 30 days, Samburu leaders ask IEBCAlso read: Samburu residents urge govt to speed up issuance of IDs
