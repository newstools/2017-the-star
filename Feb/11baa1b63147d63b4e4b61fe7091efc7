The Salaries and Remuneration Commission should be done away with as it is messing up negotiation efforts for striking workers&rsquo; salaries, Trade Union Congress of Kenya secretary general Wilson Sossion has said.He accused the commission of being a stumbling block in salary negotiations for doctors and lecturers.&ldquo;There is only one devil to the labour movement in this country &ndash; the Salaries and Remuneration Commission. It has to eventually be done away with,&rdquo; Sossion said during a press briefing in Nairobi yesterday.Doctors have been on strike for 81 days, while the lecturers&rsquo; strike enters its 38th day today. They are all pushing for better remuneration and working conditions pegged on collective bargaining agreements signed by the government.Sossion said SRC has no mandate determining doctors or lecturers&rsquo; salaries as they are not state officers. He said MPs, who are categorised as state officers, have been setting their salaries without SRC&rsquo;s control.&ldquo;And to make itself relevant, it is now busy terrorising the negotiation tables of all these workers,&rdquo; he said.
