Thousands of people are facing a water crisis so severe that households are going for days without running water in their taps.This comes after drastic climate change, characterised by rainfall deficit and unusually high temperatures, resulting in prolonged drought.NATIONAL SHORTAGECurrently, 23 counties and counting are facing a water shortage crisis, as the country faces the 12th drought since 1975.South B resident Valerie Olungah says they are receiving water once a week, which is not enough. They have to supplement with water storage tanks until the next supply from City Council.&ldquo;I am a mother of three teenagers and I run a household of six people,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;We require a lot of water just to run the house.&rdquo;But with the showers and constant flushing, coupled with poor water consumption habits, Olungah has realised that the water runs out in just two days.&ldquo;We have even had instances where the water ran out in just a day, especially on weekends, because we spend most of our time at home,&rdquo; she says.ECONOMY IN THE BATHROOM To escape the exorbitant water prices from water vendors who, according to the Water ministry, are charging up to 17 times the normal rates, Olungah has introduced a few drastic measures.&ldquo;No one is allowed to take a shower or even flush the toilet. We are now using buckets to take a bath. We also have another bucket full of water that we now keep in the toilet,&rdquo; she says.&ldquo;The toilet is only to be flushed when it is absolutely necessary and we have to use the bucket water to save water,&rdquo; Olungah says.According to experts on water conservation such as Edith Mukui, Olungah is on the right track.&ldquo;Showers release a lot of water. Up to 100 litres can be used by just one person taking a shower,&rdquo; she says.This is compared to the 10 to 20 litres the same person can use when bathing from a bucket.But for those who must use the shower, Mukui advises them to learn to take five minutes or less to minimise usage.She adds, though, that even a five-minute shower can require &ldquo;about 40 to 80 litres of water, so it is still more water than using a bucket.&rdquo; Those using showers can save water by not only cutting down the amount of time spent showering, but by using a few other tricks.&ldquo;Water your entire body in just under a minute, turn off the water, lather and scrub your entire body, and then rinse in just one minute,&rdquo; says Cathy Ng&rsquo;endo, a resident of Imara Daima, where the water crisis has reached new proportions.There should be a bucket on the bathroom at all times, she says. &ldquo;There are those few seconds when cold water runs before the water heats up, as you adjust the temperature. Collect the water in a bucket. It can be used to mop the floor later,&rdquo; she says.As for the toilet, though many consider it an inconvenience, flushing the toilet using a bucket in just one swoop is enough to keep the toilet clean.Experts say that an average person flushes the toilet five times a day, meaning it is in the toilet that most domestic water is consumed and it is also here that water can be most conserved.&ldquo;One toilet flush consumes about 14 litres. Older toilets require more water to serve the same purpose that five litres of water in a bucket does,&rdquo; Mukui says.Ng&rsquo;endo says another way to ensure the toilet does not consume a lot of water is to ensure users do not throw dirt into the toilet.&ldquo;If it did not come from the human body, it should not go inside the toilet. When the toilet is stuffed with dirt, it clogs up, requiring a lot of water,&rdquo; she says.Robert Wanjala, a plumber, offers another trick to minimise water usage when flushing the loo.&ldquo;Put a rock inside a plastic bag and place it in the water bowl, this will ensure the toilet gets the same amount of water pressure when flushed, but without using a lot of water,&rdquo; he says.Ng&rsquo;endo says many people brush their teeth while taking a shower.&ldquo;A lot of water gets wasted this way. I have two children who used to do that, but I stopped the habit,&rdquo; she says.Using a container to brush teeth comes highly recommended, with experts saying one should turn off the tap after wetting the toothbrush and to rinse using a container.Research shows one person can save up to 30 litres a day by turning off the tap when brushing teeth.ECONOMY IN THE KITCHENThe kitchen is the heart of the household, where a lot of water is also consumed. Ng&rsquo;endo cautions against &ldquo;rinsing the dishes before actually washing them, for this is a waste of water&rdquo;.She says what remains in plates and pots can be removed by hand and the dishes washed from a basin instead of running water.&ldquo;In most instances, cooking ingredients are stored in the freezer and removed just before cooking, which requires water to defrost. This is another way of wasting water,&rdquo; Ng&rsquo;endo says.She adds that people should decide early enough on what is to be cooked so that what is frozen can be removed in good time and allowed to defrost naturally.Using the right size of cooking pot is yet another brilliant idea, as the cook will end up using only the right amount of water needed to ensure the meal is ready.&ldquo;I tell my children not to boil more water than they need. It used to be the habit that even where only two cups are needed, the entire kettle is filled with water that no one needs,&rdquo; Olungah says.&ldquo;Even better, the water can be boiled and stored in a flask to be used on a needs basis.&rdquo;Wanjala advises people to fix leaking taps. &ldquo;This is very common in our households and a lot of water gets wasted in this way.&rdquo;Experts say one drip per second from just one tap can waste at least 11,000 litres of water in a year.&ldquo;This is also the time to rewind clothes with dark colours. A black trouser does not need to be washed just because you wore it once,&rdquo; Olungah says.She adds that clothes should be washed in a bunch and the water used to wipe the floor and clean the toilet.As for the verandah, she says sweeping the floor first ensures less water is used while moping, &ldquo;and this goes for the house too&rdquo;.Whatever tricks can be employed will certainly come in handy, as the ongoing dry spell does not appear to let up anytime soon.
