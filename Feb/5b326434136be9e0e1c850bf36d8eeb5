The United States and Kenyan governments should be commended for a job well done in the extradition of the Akasha brothers to face drug running and money laundering charges in US jurisdiction.The Kenyan security agencies&rsquo; multiagency raid on Baktash and Ibrahim Akasha and their associates in 2015 that culminated in their being whisked away to New York this week, where they arrived in handcuffs and leg irons, was a superb piece of law enforcement.Drug abuse and addiction have destroyed many young lives in Kenya and stakeholders must do everything possible to stamp out the narcotics trade. The trials of the Akashas in New York and the deterrent sentencing that is sure to follow will be object lessons on how to deal with drug dealers and money launderers.But there are two provisos. First, why did they have to be taken to America? Doesn&rsquo;t this show up the failures of Kenyan law enforcement and the Judiciary? Second, what about the half-dozen or so other notorious drug dealers and money launderers who enjoy total immunity and remain at large?
