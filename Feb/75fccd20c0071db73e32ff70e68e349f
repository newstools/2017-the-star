His form four results are not known and degree is not clear for which university. If he went to school during Matinga&rsquo;i time, he could get less than E," Duale said.Mvurya said he and Achani are ready to go to court and face it off with Joho over the defamation remarks."Kwale cannot be ruled by remote control by some people who think they can use their party to do so. You are from another county and you want to rule from Vanga in Kwale to Kiunga in Lamu. No way. And you want to use your money to remove Mvurya, what interest do you have?&rdquo; Mvurya said.Achani said Joho court threats are childish."Those threatening to take us to court that &lsquo;Tisha nyahu hiyo&rsquo; it is threatening a cat to us because we have decided to work with the government for Kwale to get fruits," she said.They made the remarks at Matuga School of government where they met Jubilee delegates and attended a rally at Ukunda showground in Kwale during the second day of voter&rsquo;s sensitisation campaign in the coastal region.
