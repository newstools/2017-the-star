Striking doctors yesterday hinted that they could back down on their salary demands should the government address four key concerns they raised.Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Union officials identified training, employment, staffing standards and working conditions among the issues they want the government to address urgently before they agree on a return-to-work formula.They said the government must address the human resource concerns, including harmonisation and standardisation of salaries across the 47 counties, and the national health facilities. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to go back to a system where we will supervise death,&rdquo; said KPDU secretary general Ouma Oluga (pictured). &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want a situation where a doctor is trained on the basis of tribe, so that one is released and the other one is not. These are the issues that must be addressed.&rdquo;He said doctors are willing to climb down on their demands for the interest of the suffering Kenyans only if the government demonstrated goodwill to compromise too.&ldquo;There has been a lot of misconception and misinformation that money is the only issue we raised,&rdquo; he told the committee chaired by Migori Senator Wilfred Machage. However, doctors dismissed concerns that Kenyans are suffering due to the ongoing strike saying, the situation in the public health facilities is the very reason they went on strike. The Health Committee told them to be realistic in their demands to aid a solution to the deadlock.
