Kenyans experienced a higher cost of living last month owing to a prolonged drought that triggered a drastic increase in food prices across the country.Kenya National Bureau of Statistics said the cost of market basket of selected foods changed from 1.31 per cent in December to 1.66 per cent in January.This was mainly attributed to increases in prices of cabbages, spinach, sukuma wiki and maize grain, which have remained scarce in the market due to the prevailing drought conditions.According to KNBS, prices are obtained from selected retail outlets in 25 data collection zones, which are located in Nairobi and in 13 other urban centers.&ldquo;The year-on-year food inflation stood at 12.54 per cent in January 2017,&rdquo; KNBS said yesterday in a statement.Overall Inflation stood at 6.99 per cent in January compared to 6.35 per cent in December.Over the review period, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels' index increased by 0.33 per cent.This, KNBS said, was partly due to increases in the cost of electricity, house rents and charcoal which outweighed price decreases in the cost of cooking gas and kerosene.The data shows the transport index also increased by 0.6 per cent in January 2017, compared to December.Similarly, the education cost index recorded a month-to-month inflation rate of 2.28 per cent within the same period.
