Their next game is set for February 18 against Homeboyz, who won their fourth match in a row on Saturday.After Homeboyz, KCB will host Nondies before visiting Impala and Quins. They wrap up the league against Mwamba RFC in a postponed match. &ldquo;We have five tough fixtures coming up and this is where we can cement our position at the top and show our quality,&rdquo; added Lilako.Lilako said the league is wide open and as many as five teams can win it. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been very competitive this year and its anybody&rsquo;s game. Champion Kabras, Quins, Impala, Homeboyz and Mwamba are all looking strong,&rdquo; added Lilako
