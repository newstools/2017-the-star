Kigumo MP aspirant Joseph Munyoro has criticised MPs, who are pushing for their salaries to be paid up to April next year.Speaking in Muthithi on Sunday, he said the rightful share of the MPs is up to August, when Parliament will be dissolved."It is wrong for some MPs to try and push to be paid for the time they will not have sat and legislated on behalf of the electorate. They should sacrifice that because despite the disparity in the five-year tenure, they cannot strain the government coffers especially now," he said.Munyoro said the money they are pushing for should be allocated to more pressing issues like health, drought and education.He said if the MPs are paid without work, other elected leaders will also push for the same, including MCAs and governors.
