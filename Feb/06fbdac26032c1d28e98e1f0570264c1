A court has declared the law that criminalises defamation invalid. This is seen as a win in the struggle for freedom of speech.Yesterday, judge John Mativo declared section 194 of the Penal Code - which has existed for more than 70 years - invalid.He said it contravenes the freedom of expression guaranteed in the Constitution.Mativo said anyone defamed has the right to seek compensation.&ldquo;The chilling effect of criminalising defamation is exacerbated by the maximum punishment of two years&rsquo; imprisonment. This penalty is clearly excessive and disproportionate,&rdquo; he said.Mativo said newspapers and other media play a vital role in disseminating information.&ldquo;Part and parcel of that role is to unearth corrupt or fraudulent activities, executive and corporate excesses, people who are dangerous to the society, and other wrongdoing that impinges upon the rights and interests of ordinary citizens,&rdquo; he said.Mativo added: &ldquo;It is inconceivable that citizens, the media and civil societies could perform investigative and informative functions without defaming one person or another. The overhanging effect of the offence of criminal defamation is to stifle and silence the free flow of information in the public domain.&rdquo;His judgment arose out of a case filed by Jacqueline Okuta and Jackson Njeru challenging charges of criminal defamation brought against them by a lawyer because of a Facebook post in March last year.Attorney General Githu Muigai and Director of Public Prosecutions Keriako Tobiko were of the view that the freedom of speech is not absolute.They argue that it can be limited with justification.
