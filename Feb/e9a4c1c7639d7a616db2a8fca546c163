It is appropriate that we have full disclosure under the principles of accountability and transparency and the right to information," they said in a letter signed by Siaya Senator James Orengo.While they lauded IEBC for its readiness to listen to issues raised by stakeholders, they questioned why the commission is yet to issue a response to their memorandum."An expeditious response is necessary given the restrictive timelines between now and August 8. There is no room for indecision and procrastinations," the eight-page letter reads.NASA wants IEBC to address the cloud of mystery surrounding BVR kit to the National Youth Service after demonstrating how registration of cohorts by NYS mutated into a "fraudulent and parallel" voter listing exercise.Read: NYS denies claims of conducting parallel voter registrationAlso read: CS Kariuki, Chiloba defend NYS against voter registration claimsThey also want the commission to respond to concerns over Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery's "unconstitutional and unlawful" action of coming up with regulations perceived to block proper auditing of the voter's register."We believe this was undertaken to prevent citizens and institutions like the commission from getting the population data and profiles of individuals who may be eligible or ineligible to register as voters," NASA said.They argue that IEBC is not &ldquo;enthusiastic or interested&rdquo; in challenging unlawful conduct of Nkaissery in drafting and publishing the regulations despite providing it with a copy of the Kenya Citizens and Foreign Nationals Management Service Regulations, 2016.The opposition bosses also compelling the commission to ensure it entirely uses technology particularly the integrated electronic system in the forthcoming polls as per the enacted 2016 Elections laws.They accuse IEBC of not making any attempts to get accurate and comprehensive information contained in the national population register for auditing of the voters register.
