The Kwale assembly speaker has accused the Governor Salim Mvurya and the national government of using public resources to campaign.Sammy Ruwa, a governor hopeful, said such behaviour by county officials was regrettable and uncalled for.Ruwa dismissed claims that good turnouts for President Uhuru Kenyatta's rallies in Msambweni last week demonstrated Kwale's undying love and support for his administration.&ldquo;I noticed that public resources and civil servants were visible everywhere, chanting political slogans, carrying banners and wearing political attire,&rdquo; he said.But he said the trend was worrying since Uhuru and other public servants did not respect the law and failed to draw a clear distinction between politicking and service delivery.&ldquo;This has become a worrying trend in Kenya. We see elected leaders and public servants using state machinery and public resources to campaign for political office. We see and hear of county and national administration offices being used for political campaigns,&rdquo; he said,Read: Mvurya did not join Jubilee to grab Kwale land - UhuruAlso read: Jubilee wins big in Coast as Mvurya ditches ODMRuwa further said members of the public were being forced to attend political meetings and parades where public resources and opportunities dished out with political conditions. &ldquo;These days when parents are given bursary cheques, they are threatened with not getting the help again if they do not support Mvurya's re-election," he claimed.&ldquo;ECD teachers/caregivers are also threatened with sacking if they do not support his re-election."Ruwa noted that the functions of county governments are clearly spelt out in Schedule IV of the constitution.&ldquo;I will not be surprised if the next thing we hear is that if expectant mothers do not support Mvurya, they will not give birth or that we will never harvest maize unless we support Mvurya. This is very petty politics,&rdquo; he said.The Speaker said the President and the Governor should tell Kenyans of the projects they have initiated and implemented on their own. He said they should name those approved by the National/County Assembly and paid for by Treasury.&ldquo;Those are the projects people would say would stall if they were not re-elected. But hiring teachers, tractor programmes, bursaries, loans to groups, issuance of ID cards, building of ECD centres and social halls...really?" he posed.Mvurya was not immediately available for comment. But he and Deputy Governor Fatuma Achani once criticised ODM leaders in the area who have accused them of corruption and poor performance.The Governor said anyone with concerns about county expenditure should follow the right channels in addressing them, and not engage in political wars.&ldquo;All projects are implemented after public participation... Locals are asking for more ECDEs. Those accusing us over such projects do not know their responsibilities and the geography of the county," he said.More on this: Mvurya, Achani rap ODM leaders over Kwale corruption claims
