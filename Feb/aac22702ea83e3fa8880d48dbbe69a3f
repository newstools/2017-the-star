The 2017 Kenya Hockey Union men&rsquo;s premier and national league format will be known today when team managers and KHU meet at the Nairobi City Park Stadium.Last season witnessed a pooling system which resulted in two teams from the two pools in the Premier League proceeding to the play-offs, while the top national league team was promoted to the top tier.Premier league winners Strathmore University and former champions Butali Sugar Warriors topped pool &ldquo;A&rdquo; while Green sharks and Kenya Police emerged led pool &ldquo;B&rdquo; in that order to qualify for the play-offs.KHU fixtures and match assistant secretary Wycliffe Ongori said the City Park meeting will decide whether the league should continue with the pooling format or revert to the home and away system.Many tacticians favour the home and away format because, they argue, it allows teams to play more matches and makes the league competitive unlike the pooling system which only ties teams to the same pool. &ldquo;We are hoping league starts soon. Once we decide the men&rsquo;s format and register the teams for the national league. We will set the date as our hope is to have the league started as soon as possible,&rdquo; said Ongori.&ldquo;Again, we will brainstorm on which other team should join Technical University of Kenya men&rsquo;s club in the top tier from the national league.&rdquo;TUK alongside Wazalendo Youth qualified for the top tier, but Wazalendo are non committal over joining the premier league.Meanwhile, former national team player and Butali Warriors coach Cliffe Okello, who passed away recently after a short illness, will be laid to rest today at his home in Nyakach, Kisumu County.Okello&rsquo;s last assignment was during the 2016 league play-off when he guided them to a second place finish behind Strathmore University.
