The National Cereals and Produce Board has been told to distribute subsidised fertiliser fairly to all counties ahead of the March planting season.Elgeyo Marakwet Governor Alex Tolgos has asked the NCPB to set up buying centres in all maize-growing counties, saying farmers were last year exploited by unscrupulous traders and bought fertiliser at double the price.Maize farmers in North Rift are preparing their farms ahead of the March-April planting season.He said fertiliser for Elgeyo Market was returned to Uasin Gishu county after the board failed to put up a buying centre.&ldquo;Our farmers did not access the fertiliser in Uasin Gishu and had to buy it from retail shops at high prices. We don&rsquo;t want this to happen again this year,&rdquo; Tolgos said.He warned NCPB staff against colluding with "unscrupulous businessmen" to steal fertiliser and sell to farmers at exorbitant prices, calling on farmers to be on high alert and report such cases to the police.He was addressing Elgeyo Marakwet County Dairy Farmers Association members in Iten last Thursday.The governor said last year, farmers in Kapcherop, Market West, bought a bag of subsidised fertiliser at Sh3,000, Sh1,000 more than the normal price.&ldquo;I am urging farmers to drive these fertiliser cartels out of business by refusing to buy from them,&rdquo; he said.At least 22 NCPB officials were suspended in May last year over theft and repackaging state subsidised fertiliser in various regional stores in the country.
