IDPs living in Burnt Forest, Uasin Gishu and Kakamega yesterday accused the government of neglect. They number more than 5,000. The IDPs protested on the streets on Turbo town and demanded the government compensate them.In June last year, the government allocated Sh6 billion for the final resettlement of IDPs in the 2016-17 budget.&ldquo;The government has neglected us and compensated fake IDPs while we the genuine ones still suffer in poverty. We would be forced to vote for an opposition candidate in the coming elections if this government cannot settle us,&rdquo; George Njoroge said.He is an IDP coordinator. Burnt Forest was one of the worst affected areas in Uasin Gishu county during the 2007-2008 post-election violence.&ldquo;If CS Rotich is the one adamant on releasing the money, sack him. We want the money before the general election,&rdquo; said one of the IDPs.
