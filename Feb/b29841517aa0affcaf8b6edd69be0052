Around 100 drunken youth raided Gatundu South aspirant Kung&rsquo;u Kibathi&rsquo;s home, baying for his blood.They broke the window in one of the bedrooms in Muitiku village on Saturday night.Kibathi&rsquo;s sister Triza Waruiru said she was in the living room with a woman neighbour at around 8.30pm when they heard some noise.They switched off the TV and opened the gate, only to see a crowd, some of them with motorbikes, approaching the gate. They then retreated into the house.&ldquo;The youth were shouting MK Tosha&rdquo; and asking &ldquo;Ako wapi tumuue?&rdquo; (Where is he so that we kill him?)Waruiru said, &ldquo;It is then that they started pelting the house with stones. I called my mother who was asleep and screamed to attract neighbours, who came immediately.&rdquo;She said the youth left and headed to Mutomo market.Officers from the Mutomo AP post arrived later.Waruiru said although nobody was injured, the family, including her two children who were asleep in the room where the window was shattered, and her aging mother Schola Kibathi, were traumatised. They accused Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria of masterminding the attack.Schola, who was visibly in shock, refused to speak to the press. Kibathi accused the MP of playing cheap politics and said he shouldn&rsquo;t attack his mother since she is not his competitor.Guard John Godana said he was in the house when he heard people shouting from the market.When the group approached the gate, I took a panga and a knife and switched off the security lights. &ldquo;They then started shouting &ldquo;Kung&rsquo;u ni nani Kung&rsquo;u ni nani&rdquo; (Who is Kung&rsquo;u?) and throwing stones from outside the gate, which had already been closed,&rdquo; Godana said. He said since he was inside the compound he could not see the people outside and may not be able to identify them.Kuria was earlier seen in a bar in Mutomo market, about half-a-kilometre from Kibathi&rsquo;s home, with a group of youth, where he addressed them barely an hour before the incident.Gatundu police boss Bernard Muli said they are aware of the incident and investigations are underway.Speaking on the phone yesterday, Kuria said he cannot comment on a &ldquo;nonsensical issue and journalists can write what they deem fit&rdquo;.
