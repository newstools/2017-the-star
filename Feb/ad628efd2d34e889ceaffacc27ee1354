Must every level of elected leaders have its own so-called development fund (see report P10)? The woman reps want their own fund, so do MCAs, all of them riding on the concept of the Constituency Development Fund that the courts took from the MPs and the legislators took back through the expedient of renaming it the National CDF.All these funds should be scrapped, including the NG-CDF. This would save billions of shillings that could be retained by the national government and, or go to the counties.The point is that these funds are extremely expensive and are more often than not embezzled at rates ranging from 50 to 100 per cent.And in the run-up to a general election such as the August 8 poll, the incumbents have an unfair advantage over other candidates by simply stealing from the funds to finance their reelection campaigns.Scrapping these funds will be a way of fighting corruption and impunity.
