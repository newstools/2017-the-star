Governors in the food basket counties of Uasin Gishu, Trans Nzoia and Elgeyo Market have asked the National Cereals and Produce Board to ensure subsidised fertiliser does not fall in the hands of cartels as farmers prepare for the planting season.Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago, the chairman of the North Rift Economic Bloc, said the more than 3 million bags of fertiliser imported by the government is for genuine famers.&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to hear that fertiliser is missing as has been the case in previous years, and as governors we will work with the board to ensure effective distribution to all farmers,&rdquo; Mandago said. He was supported by governors Alex Tolgos of Elgeyo Market and his Trans Nzoia counterpart Patrick Khaemba. Mandago spoke while on a tour of the NCPB depot in Eldoret to inspect the ongoing distribution of the fertiliser. Mandago says 35 staff of the NCPB were suspended last year for colluding with cartels in the distribution of the farm input. He said he will work with the board to ensure farmers get adequate fertiliser for the planting season which has started in most parts of the Rift Valley. Top dressing fertiliser CAN and NPK is going for Sh 1,500 per bag while DAP is retailing at Sh1,800 for 50kg bag. &ldquo;If we want farmers to produce adequate food then we should ensure they easily access farm inputs like fertiliser as cheaper costs,&rdquo; Khaemba said. NCPB chief executive Newton Terer said for the fertiliser to reach genuine people, farmers will be vetted by the Ministry of Agriculture and the county governments.
