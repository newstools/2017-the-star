Villagers at Kachibora and Noigam in Trans Nzoia county blocked more than 200 people who arrived in hired vehicles from registering as voters at IEBC centres.Journalist Joshua Sang, vying for governor seat, was among those who protested that the group had been ferried from another region to register as voters in the area. The group arrived in vehicles with red ribbons usually used to tag vehicles ferrying mourners. &ldquo;They arrived in more than six vehicles and at the same time. When we inquired where they had come from, some of them said they had just been sent from a neighbouring county to register in Cherangany,&rdquo; Sang said. Residents chased the group away from two registration centres.Sang said they had also apprehended a man with more than 20 IDs at a registration centre.&ldquo;We are asking the IEBC to help us deal with some of the malpractices we are witnessing. The IEBC should ensure that every Kenyan gets an equal opportunity to register as a voter in areas where they will easily vote,&rdquo; he said. Regional IEBC coordinator Bilha Kiptugen said they will investigate complaints from residents over the ferrying of people to register at particular centres.Sang said the ferrying of people to register as voters in the area will affect the democratic right of residents to vote in leaders of their choice.&ldquo;We will have people from another county coming in to influence the results of the elections, yet they are not residents of Trans Nzoia,&rdquo; he said. The group left the venue in a huff after youth threatened to turn violent.
