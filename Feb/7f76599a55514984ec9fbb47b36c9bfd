We need every vote we can get to make Raila Odinga President, Kasipul MP Oyugi Magwanga (pictured) yesterday urged residents. He urged them to come out and list before registration closes.&ldquo;At the county levels we already have enough votes to elect governors, woman representatives, senators, MPs and even MCAs. However, nationally we must ensure we continue registering for the sake of Raila&rsquo;s presidential contest,&rdquo; Magwanga said.Speaking to the Star on the phone, he said it is unfortunate that Cord strongholds have registered a low turnout unlike their opponents.Magwanga, who has been tasked with leading voter mobilisation in his constituency, urged leaders to put aside their differences and mobilise voters.&ldquo;When we launched voter mobilisation two weeks ago in Homa Bay, we all agreed to stop personal campaigns. But it is unfortunate that some of us have not adhered to the agreement,&rdquo; he said.
