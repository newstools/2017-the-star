President Uhuru Kenyatta has asked his supporters to register to vote and elect leaders who are not corrupt and who can effectively manage public resources.A lot of money placed in the hands of governors, MPs and MCAs, and Kenyans should elect good stewards, he said.&ldquo;Whose fault shall it be if you don&rsquo;t participate in ensuring whoever is elected has the capacity to manage your resources and will work for you instead of his stomach?&rdquo; Uhuru asked.The President spoke at various towns and trading centres during his tour of Nyandarua county on Friday.Apart from locally generated revenue, governors receive more than Sh200 billion from the national government annually, which is meant for water, agriculture, health and other functions, he said.MPs receive more than Sh100 million in CDF and bursary funds, Uhuru said.&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a lot of money. If corrupt, incompetent leaders embezzle this money, you will regret having put them in office by failing to vote,&rdquo; he said.Uhuru said he has no preferred candidate, but asked residents to vote for a Jubilee candidate.
