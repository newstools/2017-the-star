The National Gay and Lesbians Commission have launched an online petition seeking to stop forced anal examinations and HIV tests in Kenya. The petition was launched four weeks ago with the aim of putting pressure on DPP Keriako Tobiko to drop a case in which two men were arrested and charged based on their sexual orientation on February 15, 2015.Read: 'Un-African' homosexuality will not be allowed to ruin Diani - Governor MvuryaBy the time of press, 455 people had signed the petition which has a target of 500 signatures. Executive director of the commission said there was no complainant in the case, making it look like a &ldquo;witch-hunt.&rdquo; &ldquo;We plan to present to Tobiko the signatures and the comments because this case was started at a point of spite because there were no victims or complainants in the case,&rdquo; Eric Gitari said.&ldquo;If he is not able to drop the charges he should at least with hold their prosecution until we have a decision from the court of appeal. We had moved to the appellate court to overturn the High Court&rsquo;s ruling which gave a ruling that anal testing can be used to know one&rsquo;s sexuality,&rdquo; he added. The two were forced to do anal examinations, as well as HIV and Hepatitis B tests. &ldquo;We are also going to use these signatures to ask the Kenya Medical and Practitioners Board whether anal testing has any scientific value in prosecuting homosexuals who have had consensual sex,&rdquo; Gitari said. Cameroon, Egypt, Kenya, Lebanon, Tunisia, Turkmenistan, Uganda, and Zambia are some of the countries that legally allow forced anal testing to prove a person&rsquo;s sexuality. The examinations, often involve doctors or other medical personnel forcibly inserting their fingers, and sometimes other objects, into the anus of the accused.
