Staring death in the face because of acute hunger, some residents of West Pokot county are eating wild fruits and vegetables locally known as sokoria to stay alive.More than 320,000 people in the county are in dire need of food. Animals are dying after most water sources dried up.Selina Lolina, a resident of Turkwel, urged Kengen, which has enough water in its reservoirs, to supply some to suffering residents.She said residents walk long distances in search of water.&ldquo;Women have to wake up very early in the morning,&rdquo; Lolina said. Ombolin chief Joseph Korikimul said the situation is getting out of hand and they might lose lives if urgent measures are not taken.&ldquo;We are worried we might lose all our cattle to drought because there is no pasture or water in this area,&rdquo; he said. Korikimul said the region faces the worst famine since 1965. He said those who are lucky survive on one meal a day.&ldquo;The situation on the ground is dire and we ask for quick interventions to avert the looming disaster. This is the worst drought we have ever seen,&rdquo; Korikimul said.He said men have migrated to neighbouring Uganda with their animals, leaving women and children alone in a desperate situation.&ldquo;It is hard to sell cows and the prices have fallen. A huge one goes for Sh4,000 and there is no market as buyers are not interested,&rdquo; the chief said.The residents have thanked the county government for its efforts to distribute some food.&ldquo;We are very happy with our governor, who has helped us with food because we have nothing to depend on. Our husbands moved to Uganda to look for pasture and have not returned.We have remained alone with our children,&rdquo; Lolina said.
