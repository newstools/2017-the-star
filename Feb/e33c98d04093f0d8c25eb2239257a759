Deputy President William Ruto has asked coastal residents to support Jubilee&rsquo;s reelection based on its development record.Ruto dismissed the opposition as an outfit that had no vision for the region&rsquo;s or the country&rsquo;s development. He spoke on Saturday during a public rally at Matuga grounds and Ukunda Showground in Kwale County during his second day tour of the Coast region on voter registration drive.&ldquo;Jubilee has initiated various development projects in the field of health, energy, education, water, infrastructure and lands among other sectors barely four years in power while those in the opposition who have been in government for more than 30 years and in senior positions have nothing in terms of development for this region,&rdquo; Ruto said. National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale, Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko, Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya, his deputy Fatuma Achani, MPs Khatib Mwashetani (Lunga Lunga), Gonzi Rai (Kinango), Gideon Mungaro (Kilifi North) and Mustapha Idd (Kilifi South) accompanied the DP.Ruto who also addressed a public rally in Likoni grounds said Kenyans should assess leaders based on their development track records so as to make informed decisions during the August elections. &ldquo;Kenyans should evaluate the performance of leaders so as to differentiate between those who are committed to development and those bent on propaganda and rhetoric,&rdquo; Ruto said.Duale said opposition leaders were now in a panic mode after realizing that residents in Jubilee strongholds were turning out in large numbers to register as voters compared to regions perceived to be opposition strongholds.Read: IEBC compromising voter register to list foreigners - Raila&ldquo;Opposition leader Raila Odinga had said the contest between Cord and Jubilee will be known after the registration of voters.
