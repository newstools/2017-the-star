A lawyer has gone to court to challenge the move by MPs to award themselves salaries and allowances they have not worked for.Dismas Wambola argued that it is unconstitutional for MPs to receive benefits after their term comes to an end on August 8.He wants the court to stop Treasury CS, the Parliamentary Service Commission, the Salaries and Remuneration Commission and the AG from approving the payments.He said his suit was necessitated by recent demands by MPs to be paid salaries and allowances until March 2018 after their term expires in August.Wambola said the payment demanded runs into billions of shillings, which will have a devastating effect on the national economy.More on this: Treasury forms team to determine Sh4.58 billion gratuity for MPs, governorsOn Tuesday, Treasury bowed to pressure from Parliament to form a team to determine the lawmakers' gratuity amounting to millions of shillings each as their term lapses.The Parliamentary Service Commission, House committee chairpersons, Treasury and SRC bosses on Tuesday resolved to form the team in a heated closed-door meeting at Parliament Buildings.Treasury CS Henry Rotich said MPs are "concerned about their gratuity" as their five-year term comes to an end, hence pushing to have the money set aside.The Constitution allows the 416 MPs both in Senate and National Assembly to pocket Sh11,011,200 each as gratuity for their service once their term ends on election day.
