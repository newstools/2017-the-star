The Rift Valley region is not a Jubilee stronghold, NASA co-principal Kalonzo Musyoka has said.Yesterday, he said Jubilee wants to capitalise on &ldquo;the fake perception&rdquo; that it controls the Rift Valley to determine the outcome of the election.&ldquo;Wananchi want unity and a good life where they have access to services in the public sector, as well as get value for their taxes,&rdquo; Kalonzo said at Wilson Airport on his way to NASA campaigns in Meru county.He said the political landscape is changing in the Rift Valley because voters want a leader who can address insecurity, stop corruption and improve all sectors of the economy.&ldquo;We were in Bomet as well as Eldoret and we held lengthy talks with the residents, who promised to work with us all the way to State House,&rdquo; Kalonzo said.He said Rift Valley residents face the same problems as every other Kenyan.Kalonzo said Jubilee has failed. He cited the numerous misappropriation cases.&ldquo;The Jubilee government has totally failed Kenyans, and we will not give them room to steal the next election. We want free, fair and credible elections,&rdquo; he said.ANC deputy leader and Lugari MP Ayub Savula said the Rift Valley is divided into three zones, where ODM, Kanu and Jubilee have massive following.&ldquo;When someone says Rift Valley is a Jubilee stronghold, tell him no. Remember Pokots are in Kanu, Turkana and Kajiado are in ODM. And when they talk about Uasin Gishu and Nandi, remind them NASA has a strong stake in the regions. In fact, it is visible that Jubilee is not dominant,&rdquo; he said. The Rift Valley has the largest number of voters.
