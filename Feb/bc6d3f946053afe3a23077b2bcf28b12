Former MP Kalembe Ndile yesterday hit out at President Uhuru Kenyatta saying he does not value Kambas in Jubilee but seems more interested in winning the support of Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka.The former Kibwezi MP said Jubilee's top leadership is ready to channel all its resources to ensure Kalonzo and ODM leader Raila Odinga do not stick together in one alliance."Jubilee does not respect us Kambas who joined the new party. They actually don't value our capacity," Ndile said.Jubilee wanted to use Kalonzo to spoil Raila's chances of ascending to power, he said."They want Kalonzo to go alone like it happened in 2007 so that Raila can lose the August polls," Ndile added.There have been reports that Jubilee has approached Kalonzo several times, but the former vice president has maintained that he has no plans of joining or working with Jubilee.Ndile told the Star on the phone that the party was not involved in the planning of Uhuru and Deputy President William Ruto's tour of Ukambani which begins today.He said the people around Uhuru have single-handedly drawn the programme and are dictating to party officials what to do."We are not naive or small children for someone to come and dictate to us what to do. We are in politics for a reason and must be involved in the stages. We want to win elections," Ndile said.An SMS from former URP secretary general Fred Muteti sent to local leaders on Sunday said the President will hold rallies and roadshow from Mtito Andei to Mlolongo on Wednesday."I invite you for breakfast meeting tomorrow [Monday] at Ole Sereni at 9am to plan on the final programme," the text message said.Ndile said JP had not honoured their promises after the dissolution of other parties."Uhuru and Ruto have a notion that Kalonzo controls one million of Kamba, which must stop," he said.Ndile added that Jubilee will win the Kamba vote if it takes its campaign seriously and stops relying on brokers to access the region."I don't find Jubilee serious to win the Ukambani seats. I challenge you to work with us at the grassroots," he said.
