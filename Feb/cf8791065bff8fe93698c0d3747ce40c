President Uhuru Kenyatta is pleading immunity for the delay in prosecuting a defamation suit he lodged against KTN for linking him with violence that occurred following the disputed 2007 general election.Uhuru, who is being accused by the media firm of lacking interest in the suit, says he filed the suit before he was elected President but now as the Head of the State he enjoys constitutional protection from engaging in civil cases.The President wants the matter set aside until he completes his term. KTN wants the case dismissed with cost.But Uhuru, in a document filed by his lawyers, says the delay in pursuing the case during the period he is in office is valid and justifiable in law. He adds that he still wants justice as the media house misrepresented facts.The case will be mentioned on April 4.
