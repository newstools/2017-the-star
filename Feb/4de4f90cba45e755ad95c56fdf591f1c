Most buildings in a tiny Australian town have been damaged as bushfires ravage New South Wales (NSW) state, authorities have said.More than 80 fires - including 20 uncontained - were still burning on Monday following record temperatures.The Rural Fire Service (RFS) said it was remarkable no lives were lost amid "catastrophic" weekend conditions.But about nine of 12 buildings in Uarbry, a very small community, had been destroyed, one local man said.RFS Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons could not confirm that number but said "most buildings" in Uarbry had been damaged or destroyed.The blaze, dubbed Sir Ivan, had an active fire edge of about 200km (124 miles) and had burned through 50,000 hectares near Dunedoo, Fitzsimmons said."One of our captains in that local area was a resident of Uarbry," Fitzsimmons said."He was out fighting the fires and he has come back to find that his home is destroyed."Local resident Peter Gilmour told Sydney's Daily Telegraph that only three houses in the town were unaffected."Most neighbours have lost everything," he said."One of our captains in that local area was a resident of Uarbry," Fitzsimmons said."He was out fighting the fires and he has come back to find that his home is destroyed."Local resident Peter Gilmour told Sydney's Daily Telegraph that only three houses in the town were unaffected."Most neighbours have lost everything," he said.More than 2,500 firefighters, many of them volunteers, were battling the fires. One firefighter had suffered a severe hand laceration, while another suffered serious burns to the hands, arms and face, Fitzsimmons said.Officials said the weekend conditions were worse than during the 2009 "Black Saturday" fires in the state of Victoria, which killed 173 people.Temperatures in some areas hit records, with fast winds fanning flames. Australia's weather bureau forecast a cool change to arrive on Monday.
