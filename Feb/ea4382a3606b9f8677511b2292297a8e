After entering the main gate, we drove down to the KWS Clubhouse, just over 2km from the main gate, signposted to turn left off the tar road. On arrival, we greeted a number of people, and then sat in the spacious garden with many large green trees, and shrubs, many birds. We were here to attend a Friends of Nairobi National Park (Fonnap) fundraising function. People also had time to chat and have fun, with great food also being served. The park is in need of more friends than ever before, as there are many serious issues that threaten its future.We can think of hundreds of great reasons for you to join Fonnap but here are the top five.1.
