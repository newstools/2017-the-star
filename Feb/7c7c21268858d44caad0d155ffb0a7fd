Police on Tuesday restrained a man from reaching Baringo North MP William Cheptumo's helicopter at Kabartongo town.Mathew Kipke alias Morila had attempted to get the plane so as to shake hands with the MP before he could take off.He tore through the crowd that milled around the helicopter and shouted: "Leave me alone, I will not leave until I greet him,""I will not leave until I greet Cheptumo so that he gives me my own share," the middle-aged man said when police blocked him.Labour Cabinet Secretary Phylis Kandie and Social Service PS Susan Mochache were with Cheptumo in the aircraft.The leaders were winding up their inspection tour of cash transfer programmes in the sub-county.Moses Toroitich, Kabartonjo residents chairman, said the man is among many youths who have long wished to meet their MP but in vain.He said that the area MP should plan to walk in the villages in order to meet the voters physically."He better come to the ground than keep people in darkness by flying around in choppers," Toroitich said.Simon Cheraste, assistant chief Kaplumbei sub-location, warned residents against risking their lives by moving close to helicopters.The Baringo incident comes in the wake of another in Maua, Meru where a man hung on a chopper that was carrying Cord leader Raila Odinga. &lrm;Read: Meru 'James Bond' arrested, does not regret chasing Raila for job The man later told the media that he wanted Raila's attention over the prolonged state of joblessness in the country.Last year, a man who was later baptised 'James Bond Wanjala' hung on a plan that had transported the body of businessman Jacob Juma to Bungoma.More on this: Man injured after hanging on helicopter's landing skids to view Jacob Juma's body
