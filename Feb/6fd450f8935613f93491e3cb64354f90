NPCA Twenty20 leaders Kanbis face a crunch weekend against defending champions Swamibapa and Super League champions Stray Lions.Still unbeaten at the top of the table, the immediate former champions Kanbis will be looking to cement their position and open the gap between them, second placed Stray Lions and third placed Swamibapa at their back yard.After a huge win over Stray Lions last Sunday, Kanbis have clearly shown their intention to reclaim the title they lost in the final to Swamibapa. The Swamis have so far lost two matches from five.&ldquo;We definitely need to win all the matches as we head to the second leg next week,&rdquo; Kanbis all rounder Rakep Patel said.&ldquo;If we happen to win one it will still be fine. Our main focus will be to win all the matches. If we happen to manage that then we will have a good advantage ahead of the second round.&rdquo;Swamibapa will have to put their batting act together if they are to stop the hosts whose batting has proved to be up to the task of a title challenge.In two matches, Swamibapa&rsquo;s batting has failed to deal with the bowling challenge and it will be good to see how they perform against the strong bowling hosts.The matches come a week after Narendra Kalyan cracked the first century of the season and Rakep missed a century by only seven runs.Even though Swamibapa&rsquo;s batting has showed some leakages, their bowling has stood out thanks to Lameck Onyango&rsquo;s long experience and the spin trio of Jadavji &lsquo;Malindi&rsquo; Bhimji, Rakesh Kahar and Saumil Patel.The trio have carried their super league performance into the T20 and have impressed.In today&rsquo;s match, Stray Lions will be praying their top batsman Roger Mukasa passes the fitness test ahead of the match.Mukasa who is currently leading the batsman&rsquo;s averages in the event retired hurt after being hit on the head by a bouncer from Onyango.Mukasa alongside Jay Mehta have been impressive with the bat for Stray Lions. While Mukasa has gone on to transform his good start into match winning finishes, Mehta has failed to do something that has not gone well with the skipper.Maurice Odumbe expressed his dissapoitment when Mehta lost his wicket easily despite a good start against Swamibapa.&ldquo;We need to transform the good start into a big score. Scoring in the beginning and then losing your wicket easily isn&rsquo;t the best. One person has to bat to the end,&rdquo; Odumbe said.Odumbe will be Stray Lions&rsquo; main bowler in the match as he has proved in past matches. Against Stray Lions he was the chief destroyer with 4 for 9.
