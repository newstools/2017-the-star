National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale has said all pastoralist counties will vote for President Uhuru Kenyatta. He said Jubilee has taken unmatched development to the Tana River, Garissa, Wajir, Mandera, Isiolo and Marsabit counties.Duale singled out infrastructure, jobs and drought mitigation programmes as some of Jubilee&rsquo;s achievements in the counties. &ldquo;Politics is a game of interests and in this case ours have been catered for. As leaders, we have resolved to remain in Jubilee for the interests of our people,&rdquo; he said.The Garissa Township MP is the senior most politician from Northeastern in Uhuru&rsquo;s administration.Duale, who was addressing residents of Garissa town during several stopovers, said numbers don&rsquo;t lie and after the mass voter registration, it is clear the numbers will favour Jubilee.&ldquo;The opposition has been lying to Kenyans that it has the numbers, but I fail to understand which numbers they are talking about, while the IEBC has released figures that favour us,&rdquo; he said.Duale took a swipe at opposition chief Raila Odinga, accusing him of using a rally in Garissa town to malign him, instead of selling his party&rsquo;s manifesto.&ldquo;The Cord leader stooped too low by turning may name into an agenda. This clearly shows the opposition is running out of ideas and is using its rallies as personal contests,&rdquo; he said. During a political rally two weeks ago, Raila said he picked up Duale when he was a nobody and made him what he is today, only for Duale to turn his back on him and start abusing him in public.
