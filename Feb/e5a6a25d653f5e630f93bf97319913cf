Mumias East MP Benjamin Washiali has disagreed with Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya on whether to withdraw Kenyan troops from Somalia.Oparanya has urged the government to withdraw KDF from the peace-keeping mission in Somalia, saying more soldiers are losing their lives.He cited the devastating attack o a KDF campi in Kulbilow in which dozens were reported kiled. KDF initially said nien were killed and refused to update the death toll.But Washiali on Sunday said the best way to defend the country is &ldquo;by attacking&rdquo;. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think when we pull out of Somalia, al Shabaab will leave us alone. They will follow us like they did before our soldiers pushed them into their interior,&rdquo; he said.Washiali said giving up the mission now will give the enemy an opportunity to keep on attacking Kenya.
