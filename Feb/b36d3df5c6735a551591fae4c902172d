Two form four students from Laikipia Airbase Secondary School are being detained at the Nanyuki police station after they disappeared on their way home on Tuesday last week. They had been sent home for obtaining exam papers and marking schemes without permission. Police boss James Kithuka said Tawhida Wangui and Habiba Roba were taken to the station on Monday.
