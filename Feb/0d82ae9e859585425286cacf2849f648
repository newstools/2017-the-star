Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko has urged the Jubilee administration to resettle Mavoko squatters on the East African Portland Cement Company land in Athi River town, Machakos county.He said on Wednesday Kambas lived on the property from 1970 before it was acquired by the government for EAPCC&rsquo;s operations. Sonko said some squatters&rsquo; great grand parents were buried on the land. He spoke in Athi River, where he accompanied DP William Ruto on a voter listing mobilisation tour.&ldquo;There are several Kamba societies currently occupying the EAPCC land, each having more than 6,000 members,&rdquo; Sonko said. &ldquo;Our agenda as Jubilee is development. We want what the state did to Waitiki squatters in Mombasa done here. I urge the government to resettle Kambas on their land.&rdquo; Ruto said the government will look at the issue.
