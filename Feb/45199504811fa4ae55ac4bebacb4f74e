The High Court in Kitale on Tuesday quashed West Pokot county&rsquo;s decision to sack four senior officials.County secretary Joel Arimwonyang, Catherine Mukenyang (Health executive), Luka Chepelion (Roads executive) and Josiah Cheruiyot (Livestock executive) were sacked nearly two years ago for &ldquo;failing in their duties&rdquo;.Governor Simon Kachapin fired them after public outcry and demands by the assembly that he sack incompetent officials. But judge Hillary Chemitei said the county did not follow due process in sacking the four. Kachapin wrote dismissal letters on July 8, 2015. Chemetei said the four were not granted a chance to be heard and were not given notices as expected.&ldquo;The affected parties must be given adequate notice and or warning and a chance to defend themselves. Otherwise anything short of this shall be termed unfair and unprocedural and is bound to face the wrath of the courts,&rdquo; reads Chemitei&rsquo;s judgment. He said the legitimate expectation of the four to work and earn for the period they were to serve was curtailed. Majority leader Simon Kalekem said Kachapin should reinstate them immediately.
