Taveta MP Naomi Shaban will not retire from politics after all because &ldquo;my people pressured me to stay on&rdquo;.&ldquo;When a woman is in the kitchen cooking meat, she has many opportunities to taste the meat. She can taste the meat as many times as possible before the meat is ready to be served. Join the government so you can have more chances to taste the meat at the kitchen before it is served to all people,&rdquo; she said yesterday.Shaban had last year announced she will not seek reelection. &ldquo;Many people visited my home and persuaded me not to retire. Many did not welcome the idea that I should retire from politics at this time because of the good job I have done for them. I respect the wish of my people,&rdquo; she said.Shaban said her retirement was premature because she has not groomed anyone to take over the seat.Analysts say if Shaban retired, politician Basil Criticos could probably take over. Shaban beat Criticos by a slight margin in 2013.Shaban expressed confidence she will recapture the Taveta MP seat. She praised Jubilee, saying it has started many multimillion-shilling projects in Taveta. Shaban cited the Taveta bus park and the Voi-Holili road that leads to Tanzania.
