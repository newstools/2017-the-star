A Kakamega county clerk and his girlfriend have been awarded a Sh2.5 million Valentine's treat at Villa Rosa Kempinski hotel in Nairobi.Ramadhan Mohamed and Esha Galleh emerged winners in a couple's competition dubbed 'the greatest love story'.The 27-year-old and the 25-year-old trounced four other finalists after their fairy tale love narrative garnered 700 likes on the hotel's Facebook page."I am elated beyond words. This is such sweet news, yet I am not a heavy social media user like my girlfriend. She is the one who saw the media articles calling for love stories and convinced me that we try our luck," said Ramadhan, also known as Ramzi.Ramzi, a holder of a Political Science degree from Maseno University is a clerical assistant at the county assembly.Esha is a nurse at Kakamega General Hospital.He said he was initially hesitant and not sure if their entry would see the light of day, owing to thousands of other applicants."We sat down together and composed what has finally emerged as the winning story," he said.The two-week long competition was open to members of the public above 25 years regardless of their financial or social status. It attracted 600 applicants, with 5 shortlisted by a panel of judges drawn from some of Kenya&rsquo;s most illustrious personalities and romanticists.Nicholas Katua and Iqbal Bassi, Zawadi &amp; John and Ndereba Mwangi and Imedla were among the five couples that were shortlisted.Ramadhan beautifully narrated how he met Esha back in 2015 as a "jobless undergraduate grazing his father&rsquo;s livestock in Mumias". Incidentally, he got injured while running away from Esha&rsquo;s father who bumped onto them as he prepared to introduce himself to her.He later encountered Esha at a local hospital where she worked, when he had gone to seek medical attention after sustaining injuries while running from her father.The two will enjoy major treats next week on Tuesday during Valentine&rsquo;s Day courtesy of Villa Rosa Kempinski, including a pick-up from their residence with a convoy of limousines accompanied by a butler, a lady-in-red and security. Once in the hotel, Ramzi and Esha will go through an 'Express VIP Check In' for a one night of pure opulence in the reserved and majestic Presidential Suite, ranked as East Africa&rsquo;s best. Also included is an eight-course, candle-lit dinner on the rooftop overlooking Nairobi city&rsquo;s skyline with the executive chef, two waitresses and a butler at their beck and call. And of course, there will be unmissable Moet &amp; Chandon free flowing champagne.Other treats awaiting the winner include a one year free admission to the hotel&rsquo;s prestigious loyalty programme, Rosa Loyalty-which comes with a range of added hotel goodies and a whole afternoon of an aphrodisiac Spa pampering at the exclusive Kempinski The Spa.
