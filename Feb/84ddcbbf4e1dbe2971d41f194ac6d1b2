I have been chased away from Ford Kenya and I am unhappy with the decision, Trans Nzoia Governor Patrick Khaemba has said. The governor on Friday said he will leave the party and go to &ldquo;where the door is open for me&rdquo;. Khaemba spoke in Machewa ward.He said he has tirelessly helped the party in his capacity and wondered why some individuals insist that he failed to support the party. Some party officials from Trans Nzoia held a meeting three weeks ago and told the governor he is not cooperative. Branch officials Martin Waliaula and Musombi Munabi claimed the governor was not sponsoring the party. &ldquo;One of those speaking acquired a tender in my government worth millions of shillings. Another one is a liason officer in my government, but believe me they have turned against me,&rdquo; Khaemba said. He said he does not know why party leader Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula is mute about the matter, when junior officers issue statements to belittle him. &ldquo;I thought the party has structures. Why is it possible for anyone to just wake up anytime and announce he is chasing a senior person like me from the party?&rdquo; he asked. The governor&rsquo;s statement has generated heat in the party on grounds that he is the only Ford Kenya governor in the country. It is, however, not clear which party the county boss is likely to join if he makes his threats a reality. &ldquo;Somebody is saying that I&rsquo;m closer to DP William Ruto than Wetang&rsquo;ula. Are they my girlfriends? I deserve respect,&rdquo; Khaemba said. A week ago, the governor attended a meeting of ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi at the home of Kipruto Kirwa.
