Some senators want governors accused of funds misuse by a Senate watchdog committee barred from defending their seats.They have asked the EACC and DPP to arrest and charge the eight governors immediately.The governors are Daniel Waithaka (Nyandarua), Jack Ranguma (Kisumu), Moses Lenolkulal (Samburu), Okoth Obado (Migori), Patrick Khaemba (Trans Nzoia), Salim Mvurya (Kwale), Sospeter Ojaamong (Busia) and William Kabogo (Kiambu).The Senate Public Accounts and Investments Committee recommended that they be charged for unaccounted for expenditure and misapplication of funds.Presidential aspirant and Nyamira Senator OKong'o Mong'are, a member of the committee, said the governors have failed the integrity test.Chairman Anyang' Nyong'o (Kisumu) said the committee had gathered watertight evidence to sustain cases against the eight.Kiambu Senator Kimani Wamatangi said they were "already found culpable of theft of public funds [and] belong to Kamiti."Kisii's Chris Obure and West Pokot's John Lonyangapuo asked why the governors are still walking scot-free.The EACC, chaired by retired ACK Archbishop Eliud Wabukala is under pressure to enforce the leadership and integrity code to lock out aspirants with pending corruption cases out of the election.
