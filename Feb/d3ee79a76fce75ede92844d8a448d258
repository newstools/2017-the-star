The Parliamentary Service Commission is negotiating with the Treasury to secure a Sh1 billion allocation to construct a premier training centre in Nairobi.The money for building the proposed Parliamentary Training Centre was budgeted in the current financial year. However, due to procurement issues, which have delayed land acquisition, the Treasury is holding onto the money. The PSC now wants the resources made available in the supplementary budget.The Treasury has reportedly reallocated the money to drought mitigation initiatives. The commission will this week readvertise bidding for a 40-acre desired site, which must be within 35-40km from the central business district. Of the seven bidders who applied last year, none met the strict procurement requirements.&ldquo;We&rsquo;re on course with the project. We failed to get the best land last year. We will place an advertisement again this week,&rdquo; said a commissioner, who sought anonymity because he is not authorised to talk about PSC internal matters. He denied that one of the PSC commissioners is plotting to sell a parcel in Limuru to the commission.&ldquo;That has not come to our attention, we cancelled the previous process because nobody qualified. None of the commissioners has approached us and informed the PSC that he or she has some land,&rdquo; the commissioner said. &ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t seeking additional funds. We want the Treasury to make the money available in the supplementary budget so we can proceed with procurement.&rdquo;
