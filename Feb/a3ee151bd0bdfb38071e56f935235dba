Jomvu MP Badi Twalib is confident of reelection after rival Karisa Nzai defected from ODM to the Jubilee Party on Saturday. Nzai, the Jomvu Kuu MCA, was perceived as a great threat to Twalib&rsquo;s reelection. Twalib is a Wiper candidate, but a great ally of Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho (ODM). Insiders say this is the reason Nzai bolted from ODM, fearing he would be locked out of primaries. Twalib said Jomvu supports NASA, therefore JP should not waste resources campaigning in the area.
