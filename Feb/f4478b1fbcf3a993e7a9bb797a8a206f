Police officers in Embu are colluding with unscrupulous brokers to block macadamia buyers who are offering good prices to local farmers, Governor Martin Wambora has said.The middlemen want to be able to buy the nuts at throwaway prices, he said.The governor described the practice as retrogressive and said he will take measures to stop it so that farmers get the best price for their produce.He assured farmers that the county government supports them and wants them to get the highest value possible.Wambora said the county will encourage farmers to sell to whoever gives them the best price, whether they are Chinese investors or local processing industries. &ldquo;I am here for farmers to get the best value possible,&rdquo; he said.Wambora spoke on Friday in his office when the director of agriculture Johnston Waithaka, head of Coffee Directorate Kiplimo Meli, coffee taskforce chairman Joseph Kieyah and other senior ministry officials paid him a courtesy call.A few hours earlier, macadamia farmers and Manyatta MP John Muchiri staged a demonstration outside his office to press for inclusion of more buyers.The farmers said that last year they sold their crop to local processors but some did not pay, and when Chinese companies entered the market police started harassing them.The farmers said it is wrong for the government to side with a few individuals who are out to exploit them.Muchiri said cartels of local processors want to lock out multinational companies from reaching the farmers.The legislator said he will mobilise other MPs from macadamia growing zones to repeal the law that blocks export of raw nuts so that farmers sell to anyone offering the best prices.
