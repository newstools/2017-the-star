Governors have repeated they still oppose Health ministry recruitment of workers for the 100 container clinics. Director of Medical Services Dr Jackson Kioko had said the ministry would immediately employ nurses and clinical officers and open the clinics by May. Dr Kioko said this was agreed on during Tuesday&rsquo;s meeting with the Council of Governors. He said the two would sign an MoU.However, Taita Taveta Governor John Mruttu, who represented county chiefs at the meeting, said they will not allow the ministry to recruit staff and send them to counties. &ldquo;CoG states that the move breaches the Constitution. Health is a devolved function, which can only be carried out by the 47 county governments and not the national government,&rdquo; Mruttu said. The ministry received funds from the World Bank to hire about 400 health workers and pay them for two years. The counties would supervise the facilities and absorb the workers after the two years. Mruttu said this would be unconstitutional. &ldquo;The Council of Governors is not against the World Bank providing additional funding to counties, but this must be done in accordance with the Constitution,&rdquo; he said. Mruttu said counties cannot be forced to take up unplanned additional expenses when priority now lies in improving existing facilities and paying health workers. The ministry imported the 100 container clinics last year, but they were kept in the National Youth Service grounds in Mariakani, Mombasa, following concerns that their cost was inflated.
