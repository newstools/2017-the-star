The government has bought 150,000 metric tonnes of fertiliser ahead of the long rains expected next month. Agriculture PS Richard Lesiyampe yesterday said the government's subsidised fertiliser is available in various depots nationwide.&ldquo;The subsidised fertiliser will be sold for Sh1,800 for a 50kg bag of NPK fertiliser. CAN will cost Sh1,500,&rdquo; he said.A check from the local market showed that NPK fertiliser is selling at between Sh1,900 to Sh2,400 for 50kg bag. The top dressing fertiliser or CAN is selling at Sh2,800 to Sh3,300 for the same quantity. This comes as farmers in Kisii, Kitale and Eldoret counties complained there is no fertiliser. But the PS assured Kenyans there is enough fertiliser to cater for the 25 per cent requirement of subsidised fertiliser. Lesiyampe told the Star on the phone the government is also in the process of procuring drought resistant seedlings at a cost of Sh144 million."I urge farmers to get farm input, including certified seeds and fertiliser ready, and to prepare their land early to maximise on the rains,&rdquo; the PS said.The National Cereals and Produce Board yesterday confirmed they started distribution of fertiliser from Mombasa to various depots.early this week, Kenya Meteorological Department acting director Peter Ambenje said the country is not out of the woods yet, as the distribution of the March to May rain, both in time and space, is expected to be poor in most parts of the country.The PS said they have also received Sh3.2 billion in the financial year to procure maize for the strategic food reserve and so far the government has bought 1.4 million bags of maize.He said, however, farmers are not selling their maize to the NCPB, although the government is buying a 90kg bag at Sh3,000.Lesiyampe said traders and millers are buying 90kg bag of maize for between Sh3,400 and Sh3,500.
