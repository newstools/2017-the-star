The court yesterday temporarily blocked the government from approving payment of salaries and allowances demanded by MPs after the August 8 election.The order given by Justice John Mativo also directed that the case be heard on February 21.A lawyer had moved to court seeking to challenge the move by legislators to award themselves salary and allowances without working for it.Dismas Wambola wanted the court to stop any approval or payment of salaries and allowances to MPs after their term expires. He said it is unconstitutional for the MPs to demand payment for a period they will have ceased holding offices and offering any parliamentary services.&ldquo;Payment to MPs for no work done violates the principle that remuneration should be equal to or commensurate with the value of work done,&rdquo; the lawyer said in his suit papers filed under a certificate of urgency. He also said if the salaries are paid, it will set a bad precedent where other public office holders including governors and MCAs ask for cash without doing work. MPs are demanding to be paid salaries and allowances until March 2018.&ldquo;The payment being demanded runs into billions of shillings and will have devastating effect on the national economy,&rdquo; Wambola said. He said the demand amounts to discrimination because there are many sectors of the Public Service whose employees have been demanding &ldquo;well-deserved&rdquo; increments for actual work being done but have not gotten them.
