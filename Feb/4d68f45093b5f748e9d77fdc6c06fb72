The county government has invested Sh133 million in the project. &ldquo;Visitors and residents will no longer access the airstrip from Kitui town on a bumpy and dusty all-weather road. The improvement to bitumen works will be completed by June,&rdquo; said Lands executive Gitonga Nkunda.Nkunda said the tarmacking of the four-and-a-half kilometre airstrip adds to the tarmacking of Kitui town&rsquo;s Mjini to Stadium road and the main road in Mwingi at a cost of Sh53 million.Nkunda briefed the media after inspecting roadworks in Kitui Central, Kitui West, Kitui Rural and Kitui South subcounties on Tuesday.
