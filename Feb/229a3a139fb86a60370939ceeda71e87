The High court has barred the Senate from investigating the legality of the Kiambu County Finance Act, 2014.Justice George Odunga found the petition filed by the Council of Governor has merit and said the Senate cannot scrutinise the process and legality of a county legislation.What provoked the proceedings before court was the decision by the Senate to investigate the legality of the Act.The petitioner said action the by the Senate was unconstitutional, since its powers are limited to oversight over national agencies that manage national revenue allocated to counties.&ldquo;The mere fact that Council of Governors was neither a party to the petition nor a party on whose behalf the petition was instituted does not deprive it of the benefit of the said order," the judge said.Judge John Mativo had delivered a judgement similar to the issues being challenged before Odunga.Odunga yesterday said he adopted Justice Mativo&rsquo;s findings in which the judge said there is no mandate granted by the Constitution to the Senate to scrutinise the process and legality of county legislation.&ldquo;The parties in the case were even in agreement that the said decision be adopted to the instant petition,&rdquo; the judge said.
