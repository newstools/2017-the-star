Madison Group yesterday launched Madison UniPlan, a savings scheme for financing university and college education."We are proud to be pacesetters in critical development sectors such as education and it is in our best interest to equip Kenyans with the ability to help their children attain the highest level of education,&rdquo; the insurance company chairman Samuel Ngaruiya said. Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i, in a speech read by the CEO of Commission for University Education David Some, said the timing is good as it comes at a time when the national education curriculum is being reviewed to improve the quality of education. &ldquo;Madison UniPlan is unique in that it is the first product from the insurance sector to cater for higher education. It&rsquo;s a move that encourages parents and guardians to instill a formal savings culture for their children&rsquo;s education," Matiang'i said.
