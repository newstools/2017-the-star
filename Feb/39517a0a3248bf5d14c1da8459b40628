The Law Society of Kenya yesterday urged the Court of Appeal to make confidential a progress report on negotiations seeking to end the doctor&rsquo;s strike that enters Day 81 today.Doctors went on strike on December 5 last year, demanding the state implement their June 2013 CBA for better pay, hiring more medics and improving their work environment.In December last year, the Labour Court declared the strike illegal.A court also declared the CBA illegal and asked doctors to negotiate a new one.The report on negotiations, which was filed in court, had to be retracted to avoid it being accessed by the public.Lawyer Obura Oraro told Justices Sankale Ole Kantai, Fatuma Sichale and Hannah Okwengu that the mediation talks have been progressive but it is in the interest of the negotiations that the report remains private.The Kenya National Commission on Human Rights and the Law Society of Kenya have been spearheading the talks and the co-chairs of the negotiating team revealed that there was progress in various aspects of the dispute.Obura pleaded for seven more days to allow them reach an amicable solution.&ldquo;The mediation process has continued for the last week. We have managed to reach a consensus on a number of issues but other issues are still pending,&rdquo; he said.Lawyer James Orengo, representing the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists' Union officials, echoed Obura's sentiments.Council of Governors lawyer Eunice Lumalla said the requested seven days is too long.&ldquo;We have not even seen that report. My client is willing to only give them two days. We believe the outstanding issues can be resolved in two days,&rdquo; she said.In a brief ruling, the three judges said they are happy with the progress of the talks.They gave the negotiators seven more days to resolve the remaining issues.The judges also said that to avoid leakages, the report filed in court be handed back to the lawyers.The parties are to report in court on March 2.The union officials who had been sentenced for one month in jail for defying an order to call off the strike were released last week after parties in the case recorded a consent in court.Samuel Oroko, Fredrick Oluga, Titus Ondoro, Allan Ochanji, Hamisi Chibanzi, Daisy Korir and Evelyne Chege were released pending determination of the appeal.
