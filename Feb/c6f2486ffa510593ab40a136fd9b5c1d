Uasin Gishu billionaire Bundotich Kiprop, known as Buzeki, and former Chief Registrar of the judiciary Gladys Shollei have been locked out of a seat-sharing plan by Kalenjin elders.The elders, led by Major (Rtd) John Seii, met in Eldoret and announced that Eldoret North, including Turbo and Soy constituencies, will produce the next governor.Eldoret East, including Ainabkoi and Moiben constituencies, will produce the next senators, the elders decreed.Seii said the woman rep candidate will come from Eldoret south, comprised of Kesses and Kapseret constituencies.&ldquo;This is to ensure these areas are equally represented in top leadership positions in the county,&rdquo; Seii said.This move favours incumbent Governor Jackson Mandago, who is from Soy constituency. His rival Buzeki hails from Ainabkoi and is likely to lose out, although the elders&rsquo; position is not legally binding. Buzeki is within his rights to stand. Supporters of Buzeki and Shollei protested against the elder&rsquo;s decision.Shollei also comes from Ainabkoi and does not have the elders&rsquo; blessing to run for woman rep. It has been reserved for a candidate from Eldoret South. She has already launched her campaigns.
