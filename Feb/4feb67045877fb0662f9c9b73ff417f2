MPs have contested IEBC boss Wafula Chebukati's declaration that next Tuesday's mass voter listing deadline will not be extended.Chebukati reminded them of this during the 7th Parliamentary Leadership Summit in Mombasa on Saturday, but they argued that the constitution allows registration to continue at Huduma Centres and IEBC constituency offices.Eldas MP Adan Keynan said the announcement should have been made when the exercise began on January 16.&ldquo;This is too abrupt. Pastoralists affected by the drought have had no time to register. They should be considered,&rdquo; said Keynan.He called for an extension of at least 14 days.Read: IEBC launches mass voter registration phase 2, targets six millionKeynan's sentiments were echoed by North Horr MP Chachu Gaya who said pastoralists occupy 56 per cent of the Kenyan land mass and are critical.But Chebukati said timelines given for preparations for the August 8 general election did not allow delays.&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have time. We are not extending the period for registration beyond February 14. No registration of voters will occur anywhere [after that date]," he said..Githunguri MP Njoroge Baiya said the constitution permits registration until 90 days before the election, which translates to May 8.&ldquo;I have no reason to believe you should close it,&rdquo; he said.Chebukati told him the same constitution demands that the voter register be cleaned and verified.&ldquo;If we continue to register after February 14, there will be limited time to do the clean-up which is slated for February 14 to May 10,&rdquo; said the chairman.Mumias East MP Benjamin Washiali defended the IEBC saying specific activities must be undertaken at specific times.&ldquo;The deadlines are there to give the commission time to clean up the register and do other activities crucial for the success of the election,&rdquo; said Washiali.Prisoners and people in the diaspora will be registered between February 20 and February 28.Prisoners will have seven days to register alongside those abroad who are about 125,000.The register will then be opened for verification for a period of 30 days, from May 10 to June 10.Read: IEBC moots plans to register prisoners ahead of August 8 pollNational Assembly Majority leader Aden Duale said the announcement caught him by surprise but that he will support the electoral commission's efforts for a credible poll.&ldquo;I thought voter registration would go on at Huduma Centres and IEBC constituency offices. This means we have to ensure all our people register as voters by Tuesday,&rdquo; he said.Regarding double registration, Chebukati said they have also included national IDs as unique identifiers.Some 128,000 names have been registered twice but Chebukati said 50,000 were genuine.&ldquo;The other 78,000 have been found to be of people who have registered more than once in different areas,&rdquo; he said.Chebukati said the IEBC did not know if al Shabaab stole three BVR kits in Mandera, as stated by the government or other people.&ldquo;What we know is that the kits were stolen from the area where they were stored. But the data in the kits had already been removed so there is no damage there,&rdquo; he said.He added that the data had also been encrypted and could only have been tampered with if the thieves had decoding systems.More on this: Data not lost from BVR kits stolen by al Shabaab, says IEBCAlso read: Stop intimidating IEBC over BVR kits, voter registration, Duale tells Raila
