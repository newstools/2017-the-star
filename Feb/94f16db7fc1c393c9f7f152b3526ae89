Former Sabaot Land Defence Force militia in Mt Elgon are afraid to register as voters, leading to low voter registration.Deputy county commissioner Stephen Momanyi yesterday told the Star most of the former militia have been on the run. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m calling on the youths to register because there is nothing linking past criminal records and the voter registration,&rdquo; Momanyi said.He said they are afraid of the biometric voter registration, fearing their fingerprints would expose them to law enforcers . &ldquo;We have this serious problem. Many youths some, who escaped arrest during the Operation Okoa Maisha, fear this could be an easy way for them to be identified and arrested,&rdquo; Momanyi said.The militia caused havoc from 2006-09, killing at least 1,200 people dead. and 10,000 displaced. The SLDF started by asking for &ldquo;fair&rdquo; allocation of land, claiming the state&rsquo;s previous allocation scheme excluded genuine squatters. Its commander Wycliffe Matwakei was shot dead in 2009, alongside most of his top commanders .However, another wing led by former GSU Recce officer Sichei Chemamaik escaped and has been trooping back slowly after peace was restored.They were suspected to have sneaked into Uganda. Momanyi told the Star they refused to register after politicians spread rumours they will be arrested if their data is captured in the BVR devices.
