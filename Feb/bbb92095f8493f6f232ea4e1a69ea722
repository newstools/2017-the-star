The National Bank of Kenya has partnered with the Board of Registration of Architects and Quantity Surveyors of Kenya to drive its payments card as it seeks to grow non-interest income. &ldquo;The BORAQS card will allow members to make purchases at their preferred supermarket, fuel station or restaurant, as well as make payments over the internet in any currency,&rdquo; NBK chief executive Wilfred Musau said. The card is supported by Visa and can be accepted in more than 200 countries worldwide. BORAQS chairman Nathan Kureba said the initiative gives customers ease and convenience in cash transactions. Meanwhile, the government has called on players in the construction sector to comply with the law. State Department for Housing and Urban Development PS Aidah Munano said the government is keen to address &ldquo;loopholes&rdquo; in the sector, through enactment of a new law which will not only guide the sector, but also improve service delivery for development. &ldquo;We have the building and environment Bill which will provide a one stop shop for approvals of infrastructure and other development projects,&rdquo; said Munano.
