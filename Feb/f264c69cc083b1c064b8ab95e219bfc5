Lamu residents have sued to block the Lapsset project on grounds that it is degrading the environment and taking away their source of livelihood.Lamu residents want the dredging of Mkanda Channel in Manda Bay stopped.Dredging is the digging of ocean floor to make it deeper. The dredging is done to start off the Lamu Port-South Sudan-Ethiopia Transport project.The residents say they want to protect their rights to a clean healthy environment and to protect their culture and livelihoods. Majority of the residents rely on fishing to earn a living.Led by Mohammed Ali Baadi, the residents sued the Attorney General, County Government of Lamu, Kenya Ports Authority, National Environment Management Authority, the Lapsset Corridor Development Authority and the ministries of Environment, Transport and Energy.In support of their suit, Lamu County Beach Management Unit chairman Somo M Somo swore an affidavit giving details of the negative impact of dredging.The main complaint of the residents is that the dredging was started without them being consulted and they are now unable to fish.The residents told the court they have been informed one of the conditions from NEMA to the ministry and KPA is to provide fishermen with modern boats and fishing gear before construction begins, to ease the burden of fishing.&ldquo;We have been patient for a number of years since the Lamu Port project was approved, yet this condition has not been fulfilled as the Department of Fisheries has not done anything to provide such gear or equipment,&rdquo; Somo said.Since dredging started in October, the court was told, the locals have not been able to access fishing grounds on Manda Bay near the project site and they have not been provided with alternative sites.&ldquo;We have witnessed a reduction in the population of fish and shellfish in our popular fishing sites on Manda Bay, even beyond the dredging area. This has already started to have negative economic impacts on lobster, prawn and crab fishermen,&rdquo; Somo said. Yesterday, a five-judge bench declined to issue any temporary orders in the case. It comprised justices Pauline Nyamweya, Noel Ngugi, John Mativo, Joseph Onguto and Jaden Thuranira.However, they gave the Attorney General an opportunity to respond to the matter and said they will visit the site.The case will be heard on March 16.
