Agricultural machinery distributor FMD East Africa is preparing farmers for the planting season and has lined up a series of training workshops this year.The firm set up MF Xtra Care Clinics in Ziwa, Kachibora and Kapenguria, where William Caetano, a Baldan technical demonstrator from Brazil, demonstrated to farmers how to use calibrated Baldan planters and ploughs for healthy yields. Caetano said it is important for farmers to know how to correctly calibrate a planter to achieve the recommended inter-row and intra-row seed placement. He said it ensures seeds are properly placed in the soil to promote vigorous root growth and even emergence. Correct plant population at recommended spacing enhances healthy plant competition resulting in higher productivity, Caetano said in Kapenguria last week.The training session was hosted by West Pokot Senator John Lonyangapuo, also a farmer, with more than 30 Massey Ferguson tractor owners and operators attending the event.Owners of the tractors who brought their machines to the clinic benefitted from a free 43-point inspection by MF trained technicians.The workshops are aimed at raising farmers' awareness on how they can reduce frequent breakdown of their machines to reduce repair costs and increase returns on investment. The technicians also educate farmers on the latest agricultural machinery trends and the advantages of mechanisation.
