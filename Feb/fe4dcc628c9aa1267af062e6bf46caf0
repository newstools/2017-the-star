Sports Dispute Tribunal yesterday flexed their muscles and directed that the 2017 Sportpesa Premier League kicks off in a fortnight with a tentative 16 teams including National Super League sides Nakumatt and Zoo Kericho. Sofapaka and Muhoroni Youth as well as Vihiga United and KCB have been ommitted from the list pending further consultations. KPL CEO Jack Oguda recalled that they had received communication to that effect from their lawyer Geoffrey Obura and they would abide by the tribunal ruling.&ldquo;This was a judicial matter and we have to respect the decision that they reached. As KPL, we are ready to move on and start the league,&rdquo; said Oguda.The league&rsquo;s technical team and governing council will now have to redraft and ratify the fixtures to reflect the composition of the tentative 16-team league that will now include AFC Leopards, Bandari, Chemelil Sugar, Gor Mahia, Kakamega Homeboyz, Mathare United, Posta Rangers, Sony Sugar, Thika United, Tusker, Ulinzi Stars, Western Stima, Nzoia United and Kariobangi Sharks.Meanwhile, In a bid to end the stalemate that has seen the start of the 2017 Sportpesa Premier League suspended, Football Kenya Federation have invited Kenyan Premier Leagueclubs&rsquo; chairmen for an urgent consultative meeting at the Kasarani Stadium VIP Lounge, today at 10am. &ldquo;The move has been necessitated by the two failed JEC meetings with KPL stating that have been unable to attend the same due to one of their members being indisposed. This is despite the KPL/FKF MOU clearly stipulating that two members from each side can form a quorum and deliberate on emerging issues,&rdquo; read a statement from FKF. &ldquo;FKF President Nick Mwendwa in consultation with the FKF NEC members has resolved to meet all 2017 KPL chairmen, in a bid to amicably resolve the top tier league&rsquo;s composition, brought about by the failure of both Sofapaka and Muhoroni Youth to meet the 2017 Club Licensing Criteria, which subsequently led to the two being disqualified from the KPL and as a result, being relegated to the second tier league,&rdquo; concluded the statement.The 2017 season according to fixtures released by KPL earlier this week was to start today with an initial sixteen teams. To the ire of th federation, Vihiga United, Nakumatt and KCB were missing.
