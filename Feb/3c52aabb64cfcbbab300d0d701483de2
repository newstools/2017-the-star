A male lawmaker told his peers that Sunday mornings are intended for wives to bring their husbands breakfast in bed - while his colleague complained about his wife's spending habits. North Dakota Representatives Bernie Satrom and Vernon Laning shared their views on marriage last week while fighting the repeal of the state's blue laws, which dictate that businesses should open later than usual on Sundays, or not at all.Satrom described how he thought Sunday mornings should be spent, saying it involved "spending time with your wife, your husband. Making him breakfast, bringing it to him in bed and then after that go take your kids for a walk."His colleague Laning, meanwhile, complained on the House floor that his wife was spending all of his money - and implied that Sunday mornings gave him a much-needed respite."I don't know about you, but my wife has no problem spending everything I earn in six and a half days," he said. "And I don't think it hurts at all to have a half day off."The two men are both married Republicans and each have four children, according to their representative profiles.Their comments came during a session of the North Dakota House Of Representatives, of which Laning has been a member since 2013. Satrom joined the state legislature this year.Congressmen were discussing whether to repeal North Dakota's blue laws, which are among the strictest in the country.They require most businesses that cater to the public to remained closed from midnight to noon on Sundays, with some exceptions for places such as hospitals, hotels and restaurants. Operating one of those businesses before noon on a Sunday is a class B misdemeanor in North Dakota, meaning a person faces a maximum of 30 days behind bars and / or a $1,500 fine, if convicted.The law, first enacted in 1887, initially required all businesses to remain closed on Sundays.But the rules started changing after a blizzard dropped 20 to 30 inches of snow on the state on a Saturday. Residents needed to buy supplies the following Sunday - making it necessary to exempt some businesses from the law.It wasn't until 1991 that all stores were given permission to open at noon on Sundays.Some are now campaigning to repeal the remaining restrictions."It's hurtful, to know that that's the reasoning that they're using," a young woman from Fargo told Valley News Live after learning of Satrom's and Laning's comments."It's frustrating, personally, because when you know those are the people representing you and you don't feel like you're being represented - and when those kind of backwards ways of thinking are still present - it's upsetting."Laning told the network that his comments have been taken too seriously and suggested that those who were offended by his comments lacked a sense of humor.
