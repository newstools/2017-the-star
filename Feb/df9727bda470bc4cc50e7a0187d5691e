The Agriculture Committee is considering a far-reaching legislative proposal to streamline the local sugar industry.The Crops (Amendment) Bill 2016 was proposed by Navakholo MP Emmanuel Wangwe. It seeks to tame rampant sugarcane poaching by having farmers register with miller companies of their choice.Under the Bill, no miller will be allowed to gatecrash territories to harvest sugarcane from farmers recruited by another company, an industry malpractice that face poaching of the crop.To ensure farmers are able to choose the best millers, Wangwe proposes registration be done within five months of planting.The MP also proposes stricter timelines within which millers must pay cane suppliers.&ldquo;Failure to pay as per the specified period, the miller is required to pay a monthly interest penalty equivalent to the prevailing bank lending rate on the value of the crop,&rdquo; the Bill reads.It suggests millers and farmers share the proceeds from the value addition chain, including sugar, molasses and spirits.
