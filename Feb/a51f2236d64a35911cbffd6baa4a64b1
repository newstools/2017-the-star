The majority of Kenyans want the national government to take charge of the Health docket.However, they remain firmly opposed to the doctors&rsquo; strike and their salary increment demands.This is according to the initial results released by Ipsos, from a survey which partly touched on the doctors&rsquo; strike, now on day 65.&ldquo;Support for the counties as the main providers of health services has modestly declined. Only one third or 32 per cent Kenyans prefer the counties should have this responsibility. It is clear, that the strike has affected views about where this responsibility should rest,&rdquo; the report released yesterday said.Only one-third or 33 per cent of Kenyans support the doctors&rsquo; strike. This proportion is even larger among those who either personally or through someone they know are directly affected by the strike in having been unable to obtain medical services.&ldquo;This is given the critical nature of the services much of the public has been missing during the doctors&rsquo; strike, awareness of both the strike itself and their union&rsquo;s main demand is extremely high,&rdquo; Ipsos said.Among those aware, an even larger proportion of 95 per cent correctly identified the doctors&rsquo; main demand of legal registration and implementation of the Collective Bargaining Agreement of 2013 or salary increment.The target population for this survey was Kenyans aged 18 years and above, of whom 2,057 living in urban and rural areas, spread across 42 counties were interviewed.The margin-of-error attributed to sampling and other random effects for the entire sample is +/- 2.15 with a 95% confidence level.Ipsos cautioned that the survey was conducted between January 9 &ndash;26 and some of the views captured may have changed.
