An alcohol beverage company has sued the Kenya Revenue Authority for failing to issue them with a Tax Clearance recommendation.Bispect Limited says KRA has refused to issue them with the recommendation, despite the Inter-Agency Task Force on Control of Potable Spirit and Combat of Illicit Brews inspecting its factory and recommending it get the certificate.This has delayed the process of obtaining a letter of authority to resume manufacture and production of its alcoholic products.The company is a licensed manufacturer of spirits, but operations stalled following a crackdown on illicit liquor in 2015.On July 5, 2015, the plant was looted, destroyed and partly burnt, forcing it to close down. It was reconstructed and new equipment installed.
