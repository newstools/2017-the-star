Kitui leaders have urged the government to hire and arm police reservists to protect residents from armed herders from Garissa and Isiolo and Tana River.The call on Friday came from Senator David Musila and MPs Joe Mutambu (Mwingi Central), Munuve Mati (Mwingi North) and Rachael Nyamai (Kitui South).They want President Uhuru Kenyatta and Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery to intervene and restore order.They want retired police and military officers from the community hired as reservists. The leaders said residents have been attacked, killed and robbed by armed herders from Garissa. Musila said 25 residents have been killed since last year, the latest being Kilungu Musyimi shot dead on January 21 at his home in Sosoma, Mwingi Central.&ldquo;Since we started talking to Nkaissery last year, 20 people have been killed. Five others were killed after we pleaded with the President during his visit on December 6 last year,&rdquo; Musila said.The worst-hit areas include Kathungu, Sosoma and Ndooni in Mwingi Central, Myuuni in Ukasi, Mwingi East and Inyaanzai in Mwingi North, where two people were killed on January 1.Munuve said Administration Police set up a Quick Response Team and deployed 30 officers in Inyaanzai Primary School after the two were killed.&ldquo;We have done our part and we concluded talks at the subcounty and county levels. It is now upon the OP,&rdquo; Munuve told The Star on the phone.Mutambu said the Kamba community are vulnerable to constant raids by armed herders from Isiolo who disguise themselves as nomadic herders searching for pasture.&ldquo;We are not seeking to kill Somalis. They have been our good neighbours and we have coexisted peacefully for decades. All we want is armed police reservists to help our people when attacked,&rdquo; Mutambu said.
