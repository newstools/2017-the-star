Tobacco firms should be forced to pay part of their profits to a central fund to treat cancer patients, lobby groups have said.The requirement is contained in the 2014 Tobacco Control Regulations that came into force last week after BAT lost a case to stop them.&ldquo;We expect the tobacco companies will be mandated to take responsibility and support the government&rsquo;s efforts in curbing the rising effects of tobacco use through mandatory contribution to the Tobacco Control Fund,&rdquo; Joel Gitali said.He is the head of the Kenya Tobacco Control Alliance, which led lobbies to support the Health ministry in the case.The regulation requires tobacco firms to pay two per cent of the value of tobacco products manufactured or imported by each firm every financial year. Cigarette companies are also required to print gory images of sick and dying smokers on packets to discourage smoking.
