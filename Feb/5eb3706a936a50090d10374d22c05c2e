Former Kisauni MP Anania Mwaboza has agreed to be businessman Suleiman Shahbal&rsquo;s running mate in the race for Mombasa governor.The two, who will run on the Jubilee Party ticket, reached an agreement after several meetings.Mwaboza reportedly agreed unconditionally to support Shahbal after Deputy President William Ruto insisted he and Shahbal run on the JP ticket.The plan is to ensure Jubilee defeats incumbent Hassan Joho. &ldquo;The DP has vowed to do everything to ensure Joho is defeated,&rdquo; a senior official who attended yesterday&rsquo;s discussions said.Mwaboza had previously insisted on being given a Cabinet position to step down in favour of Shahbal.Ruto said there will no longer be a &lsquo;Team Shahbal&rsquo; and &lsquo;Team Mwaboza&rsquo;.&ldquo;Team Shahbal will be Team Mwaboza and Team Mwaboza will be Team Shahbal. Now we have Team Jubilee in Mombasa,&rdquo; he said.Ruto made the announcement when he met 300 Coast aspirants in Mombasa.This ends months of fighting between Shahbal and Mwaboza&rsquo;s supporters, which had hurt Jubilee&rsquo;s bid to clinch the seat in the ODM stronghold.The deal, according to sources who were at the meeting, involves a 50-50 sharing of all county government positions.&ldquo;All appointments will be done in consultation between the governor and the deputy governor,&rdquo; a source said.Shahbal said he joined hands with Mwaboza because they have common goals.&ldquo;On August 10, we will have taken over Mombasa and we will begin the journey to create thousands of jobs for youths. We will not overburden small-scale traders with taxes,&rdquo; he said.Mwaboza told the Star, &ldquo;There have been several meetings in Nairobi and Mombasa. All we want is a better Mombasa with jobs created for the youth.&rdquo;The Shahbal-Mwaboza deal improves Jubilee&rsquo;s chances of winning the seat as the Mijikenda are likely to support one of their own - Mwaboza.The community has the highest number of registered voters in Mombasa at more than 130,000.Shahbal commands a significant following among the Swahili Arabs.Other apirants will have to go back to the drawing board.Nyali MP Hezron Awiti, who is also eying the governor position, has also declared his running mate will be a Mijikenda.This means the Mijikenda votes will be divided between Shahbal, Awiti and Joho, who also enjoys a significant following among the Mijikenda.However, Joho&rsquo;s perceived mistreatment of Deputy Governor Hazel Katana - also from the Mijikenda community - will have a significant bearing on the votes he gets from the group.&ldquo;Unless he does something to appease them, which may be too late given the time left to the August 8 election, the situation does not look good for him,&rdquo; political analyst Mwakuja Mrombo said.Governor aspirant and Mombasa Senator Hassan Omar is yet to declare his running mate, but he is likely to choose a youthful academic or a human rights activist, analysts say.In 2013, Shahbal got about 98,000 votes in Mombasa against Joho&rsquo;s 138,000.A month ago, Mwaboza had told the Star the Mijikenda community will not settle for the deputy governor position.But yesterday, he said sometimes people have to make sacrifices for the greater good.&ldquo;Like the late [and former Interior minister George] Saitoti said, there comes a time when the country is bigger than an individual. I say the time has come when the county is bigger than two individuals named Shahbal and Mwaboza,&rdquo; Mwaboza said.Last month, President Uhuru Kenyatta summoned Shahbal and Mwaboza in an attempt to end their rivalry.The two met the President at State House. The leaders, through a text message, confirmed to the Star they were at State House for the meeting with Uhuru.&rdquo;The president had declined to meet them until they resolved their differences. The two are deemed to be crucial for the President&rsquo;s support at the Coast.&nbsp;&nbsp;
