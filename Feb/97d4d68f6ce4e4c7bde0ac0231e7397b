A 34 year old man who attacked a magistrate inside the court on November 22 2016 has been denied bond.In his ruling on Thursday, Chief Magistrate Josphat Burudi said Kuhora is a threat to the public safety. &ldquo;I hereby dismiss the application by the accused through his lawyer to have the accused freed on bond terms. Though it is his constitutional right, the safety of the public is at stake and he is also a potential flight risk,&rdquo; said Burudi in his ruling.Michael Kuhora committed the heinous act after the Resident Magistrate Eunice Kelly sentenced him for three years in prison after he was convicted of assaulting Edith Adhiambo.Kuhora is facing six counts among them attempted murder against the magistrate and police constable Regina Wanjiru.He pleaded guilty of attacking and injuring them causing bodily harm with intent to kill two but denied obstructing the police from discharging her duties according to the law.He also denied charges of intentionally obstructing the magistrate from performing her judicial duties with intent to kill and causing disturbance in court.It is alleged that Kuhora used a screw driver to stab the two as he is an electrician saying he was under the influence of alcohol.He further told the court that he expected a lenient sentence to enable him continue with his job as an electrician.The act was highly condemned by the jury including chief justice David Maraga.Through lawyer Gacheru Ng'ang'a, the accused asked for CCTV footage to be used in his trial.Kuhora will appear on March 2 for hearing while serving his three-year imprisonment.
