Samburu women who held a protest against Raila Odinga have been summoned alongside their sponsors by their elders over the "embarrassment".The women burned the Opposition leader's posters and lit bonfires in a demonstration on February 8 against his criticism of their leaders.Raila accused the leaders of using development funds to acquire private property in the county and in Nairobi. He claimed they have bought huge pieces of property whose costs do not match their earnings. This was during his visits to Maralal and Baragoi towns the previous week.More on this: Samburu residents protest against Raila, says local leaders deserve respectDemonstrator Ann Lenturkan urged Raila to positively criticise the leaders in his search for votes from the region.Resident Joyce Lesilampa said their leaders were not thieves as portrayed by the Opposition leader.But more than 1,000 Samburu elders from across the county met at Yamo grounds in Maralal town and agreed that everyone who participated or sponsored the demonstration should appear before them.They said on Wednesday that a goat will be slaughtered for a cleansing ceremony and that those who skip the ceremony set for next Friday will be cursed.&ldquo;Those who took part in the demonstration have been given one week to appear before the elders for questioning before they are cleansed for the wrong they committed," said elder Joseph Lenanguram.The elders also issued a directive for no activity to take place at Kenyatta Stadium, where the demonstrations began, before the cleansing ceremony.They said the women's actions violated the cultural values of the Samburu community and that the burying of effigies of Raila embarrassed the community and leaders.Elder John Lopokopeny said disrespecting Raila, a national political leader recognised across the world, was embarrassing and should never be repeated in the county.&ldquo;Raila has a right to give speeches to the people in this county. We have met to lift that curse from him,&rdquo; he said.The elders added that Samburu is a democratic county where Cord and ODM leader is respected and can seek votes.
