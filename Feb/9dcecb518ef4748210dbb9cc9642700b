Kiambu Governor William Kabogo yesterday asked the High Court to give him more time to respond to a suit that seeks to order him pay Kabete Mp Ferdinand Waititu Sh 50 million being legal fee claim.The Governor asked Milimani Law Court&rsquo;s Deputy Registrar Sharon Mwayuli to give him at least 14 days to respond to the bill of cost filed by Waititu, saying he was going to oppose it.Waititu want the court to order Kabogo pay him Sh50, 960,422 arise from a suit the governor filed last year questioning his Panjab university degree.He says spent the money from March 14, 2016 when the case was filed in court.&ldquo;We are yet to respond to the applicant&rsquo;s (Waititu&rsquo;s) claim and we are requesting for at least 14 days&rdquo; Kabogo&rsquo;s lawyer Issa Mansour told the DR when the matter came up before her yesterday. Consequently, Mwayuli directed Kabogo to respond to the application and parties to go back to court on March 23 for hearing. Kabogo, in his bid to bar Waititu from contesting in the august 8 general election, challenged his integrity and academic qualifications.The governor had accused Waititu of identity theft alleging that that Mp was using another person&rsquo;s academic papers and did not have any post-primary school education, let alone a degree from the university in India.However in December, Justice Joseph Onguto dismissed the case saying the court lacked jurisdiction to meddle in the dispute.Following the dismissal, Waititu slapped Kabogo with the bill saying he spent over 50 million defending the suit that he now says elicited public interest.The Mp who has announced his interest to dislodge Kabogo from the Kiambu Governor&rsquo;s seat has asked the court to consider the nature of the proceedings and the time he spent.He says the amount sums up the total incurred from the moment he instructed lawyer Harrison Kinyanjui to represent him in the suit.
