Embu Senator Lenny Kivuti is under fire for sending Valentine's SMSs instead of mobilising voter registration as the exercises closes on Tuesday.Youths said Kivuti could have done better than package his message in a less than 20-word text signed off with "TWENDANO MUNO".The youths said Kivuti should have held a party for those who registered as voters, rather than inviting residents to celebrate Valentine's Day at his home.Muriithi Njoka from Mbeere North said Kivuti "is rich enough to assist the needy reach registration centres"."He could have made it his responsibility to go round the county mobilising people to register to vote and to assist those unable to reach centres," Njoka added.Read: Embu county to fast track issuance of ID'sAlso read: IEBC likely to miss target of 6 million new votersOther residents expressed shock at how the Senator had obtained their phone numbers."I have never met the Senator. He is not my friend even on Facebook," Ngari Kanyui said.But some residents had no problem with Kivuti's message, saying the Senator touched their hearts."Though love can't put food on the table nor pay my bills, it feels good to be loved and Kivuti's message made me feel loved," Wawira Ngari said."Happy Valentines Day too my Senator. May the love in your heart for humanity flourish and surpass all shreds of hatred," said Esther Nyarwai.Others believed that the senator is sending the messages as a way of campaigning."If he really meant it he would have used a national newspaper or television to broadcast his Valentine's love," Betty Muthoni said.Winnie Mutune sarcastically said the Senator should have delivered customised flowers to every youth in the county if he really meant love."This is not the first time he is sending us such messages; he sent us a Christmas message, New Year message and now he has sent us Valentine's message," Esther Wanjiku said.Kivuti's personal assistant Ben Mwaniki told the Star that the SMS was a message of love and goodwill to all Embu county residents.He said it was sent to all 300,000 Embu county adults who own mobile phones."Being a day to express love, we decided to send a message of love and goodwill to our people, we feel and love them," he said."It's a good will message on a day the whole world is celebrating love, our clarion call has always been Twendane Muno," he added.
