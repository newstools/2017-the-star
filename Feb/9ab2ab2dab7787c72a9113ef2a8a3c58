THE High Court has stopped the Communications Authority of Kenya from setting up a system to spy on Kenyans' mobile phones.The decision, communicated by CA on January 31 and February 6, was addressed to Safaricom Ltd, Orange-Telecom and Airtel Networks Kenya Ltd.Justice John Mativo certified the matter urgent and said pending the determination of the case, no person or agent claiming to be from CAK will give effect to the said letters.He further directed that parties to file their responses ahead of the hearing on March 6.Activist Okiya Omtatah moved to court on Friday last week to challenge the decision to spy on Kenyans.He claimed CAK retained Broadband Communications Network Ltd as the principal contractor to implement the impugned device management system to spy on Kenyans. The company was allegedly awarded a Sh207 million tender to design, supply, deliver, install, test, commission and maintain the device in September 2016.Omtatah said the devices have the capability to access all information stored by the service providers and transacted on phone owned by individuals, including the times and dates of the communication, the exact location where one is placing the calls and the duration of the calls.The arrangement, he said, will involve Broadband getting hooked up to all routers of Orange-Telecom Kenya, Airtel and Safaricom, effectively opening up private communication data to an entity other than those licensed to hold them and the governmentOmtatah now wants the court to declare CAK's decision unconstitutional.He also sought to have the two letters, in which dates have been set or the plugging of the snooping device beginning Tuesday next week, quashed.Omtatah argued that although the government claims the tapping is to enable it track counterfeit devices, Kenyans will lose their privacy when it starts.&ldquo;Already under the law, the government can listen to private conversations and access personal data, if it convinces a judge that there is a good reason to do so and gets a warrant to execute the same,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;There is no proper legal framework backing such a development and I am alarmed that in the absence of a Kenyan data protection law, nothing stops the hired company from abusing the personal information of members of the Kenyan public upon gaining access.&rdquo;
