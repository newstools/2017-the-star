A politician has funded the transfer of more than 2,000 voters from Ndia constituency in Kirinyaga to Mathira, Nyeri county, Mathira MP Peter Weru has said.&ldquo;This is very wrong, absurd and unacceptable because it is aimed at interfering with voting and nominations,&rdquo; he said. The constituencies border each other. Speaking at Kiawarigi on Wednesday, Weru urged the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission and police to investigate and take immediate action.He said it is foolhardy to transfer one&rsquo;s vote because the politicians funding such people will disappear if they lose the nominations.Mathira MP aspirant Rigathi Gachagua dismissed the claims, saying many women from Ndia who were married by Mathira residents in the last five years are changing their voting stations.&ldquo;This is sensing defeat. He [Weru] should not be worried or panic over the elections. Mathira has more than 100,000 voters. Why is he panicking because of the 2,000 votes?&rdquo; he said.Gachagua praised the Mt Kenya Foundation for mobilising residents to get voter&rsquo;s cards. The number of registered voters has increased due to the mobilisation, he said.
