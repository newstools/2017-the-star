Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka is back at the Coast for the final push in voter mobilisation.The numbers are worrying, according to Wiper, and it fears the opposition might lose to Jubilee again.Coast is poised to play a central role in the election, but its turnout is low compared to Jubilee strongholds. Almost all the six Coast counties have failed to reach half the target set by the IEBCOn Sunday Kalonzo will lead the 'Mass Voter Registration - II' in Mombasa. He will attend a rally in Kadongo Grounds, Mishomoroni.He will also lead the caravan to Nyali and Kisauni.On Monday, Kalonzo, Senator Hassan Omar (secretary general) and Nyali MP Hezron Awiti (treasurer) will hold rallies in Kwale, a county where most of its leaders have defected to Jubilee.On Tuesday, the three will lead other party members to Jomvu and Changamwe constituencies, where Deputy President William Ruto visited last week and urged voters to kick out the Mombasa leadership. Registration ends on Tuesday.Kalonzo is also expected to receive defectors to the party.Omar said they will come up with a strategy to get as many residents as possible registered in the remaining days.&ldquo;We have to give people hope that the despite the failure by the current government, we can still register and vote in new leadership,&rdquo; he said on Thursday. Awiti accused some IEBC clerks of not reporting to work. He said he visited many centres, where clerks were absent. He said he is conducting door-to-door mobilisation.Simon Addala, who is leading the Nyali campaign, said since last week the numbers have started to gradually increase.
