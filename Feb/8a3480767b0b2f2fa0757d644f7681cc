I&rsquo;m confused. Mr N has just left, slamming the door behind him and all because I asked who the fourth target is. This is what we do, we blackmail people. Heck, it was his idea. It&rsquo;s his friends we&rsquo;re doing this to. So what&rsquo;s his problem? He&rsquo;s acting so out of character. First the cuddling, now this. I will never understand that man. I&rsquo;m not too sure what to do with myself, now that he&rsquo;s gone. I should have kept my big mouth shut. I&rsquo;m not sleepy so I warm some milk, put some cinnamon in it and crawl back into bed, cradling my mug. I take a sip and place it gingerly on my bedside table. I switch on the TV and idly flip through channel after channel. Nothing interesting. I log on to my Twitter feed and find it full of news of Beyonc&eacute;. It turns out she&rsquo;s expecting twins. People get pregnant everyday, so why is the world losing their collective minds over her getting knocked up? I touch my belly. There is a baby growing in there. Maybe two. Who knows? Something else catches my eye on my Twitter feed. It&rsquo;s a thread about someone writing about his worst sexual experience. The story is written in a series of tweets attributed to @kevbosire. What a coincidence. Bosire is Eric&rsquo;s surname. I grab my milk, happy that I have something to read to pass the time.The &ldquo;50 Shades of Grey&rdquo; movie that came out in 2015 really got some of you chicks worked up with some crazy BDSM fantasies. I had this girlfriend, now ex, who was always up with this craziness. I used to call her Kabu, short for Kabooby coz...big boobs, it was just those cheeky nicknames you give each other when you are dating. We actually met late 2014, dated through to early 2016. But this BDSM thing from that &ldquo;50 Shades&rdquo; movie was nailed into her head yaani. But I always turned it down because it&rsquo;s just not my thing to be honest. To make it worse, she wanted to dominate me. I don't trust people tying me up and all that crap.I sit up and put my milk down. This is, without a doubt, Eric. I have never mentioned this to you but Kabu was his nickname for me (Now you know why I never mentioned it!). Why is he writing about us on Twitter? And my BDSM obsession? I keep reading. It became a source of arguments. Mara &ldquo;Ooh you always get the kind of sex you want but you always turn down what I want,&rdquo; mara &ldquo;Ooh I don&rsquo;t think you love me anymore.&rdquo;&#8232;I had swallowed a crowbar na hiyo story, no bending. Strong.&#8232;This went on for months, then suddenly, any white male looked like that character Christian Grey. Now I can't forget his name. We are there watching a movie, &ldquo;Babe, si he looks like Christian?&rdquo;I&rsquo;m feeling cold all over and pull my duvet around me. How dare he write about this? How dare he?!And then I was like&hellip; this s**t again. Argument pap! Halafu silent treatment the whole week. We are walking in Village Market, a white guy passes, she nudges and whispers, &ldquo;Aki ona Christian.&rdquo; Ever thought of starting an argument and bringing sense into someone's head and you just feel mentally tired?&#8232;Like trying to plot how to break into Fort Knox even though you know it&rsquo;s impossible. That&rsquo;s how I used to feel.&#8232;Then I would go silent, she goes silent&hellip;date ruined.&#8232;We always patched things up. However, three months before her birthday she had pushed me to the wall.&#8232;&rdquo;Babe, for my birthday me I just want a BDSM session with you.&rdquo; I was tayaaad. &ldquo;Fine then.&rdquo;&#8232;She was taken aback, &ldquo;For real?&rdquo;...&rdquo;Yeah sure,&rdquo; I replied casually. &ldquo;Sawa I&rsquo;ll make arrangements.&rdquo; She was excited.I&rsquo;m afraid to keep reading. Will he reveal all?
