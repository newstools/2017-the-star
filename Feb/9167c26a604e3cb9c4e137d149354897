Thirty per cent of public boreholes in Nairobi have dried up in two months due to the drought and water crisis in the capital.The county government has said out of the 79 boreholes it has, only 56 are working. The remaining 23 have dried-up. The actual number is higher, as the county cannot account for 4,000 privately owned wells in the city. &ldquo;Boreholes, just like human beings, grow old and if you grow old you produce less,&rdquo; Governor Evans Kidero said.Kidero on Thursday said the boreholes have an average depth of 220-320 metres. They produce between five and 23 cubic metres ( 1 million and 23 million litres) of water per hour. He said water at the Ndakaini Dam has dropped from 89 million cubic metres to 37.5 million cubic metres. The level dropped seven per cent in January alone. The drop has been caused by drought in Kikuyu, the Aberdares and Mt Kenya, the main water areas for rivers serving the Ndakaini Dam.Last week, the county and the Water ministry announced partnership to sink 40 boreholes across the city. The boreholes will cost Sh200 million and will be completed in three weeks.Water CS Eugene Wamalwa said the wells will add 20 million litres to the city each day. &ldquo;We will have more than 10 rigs availed from the NYS and the military to ensure work starts as soon as possible,&rdquo; he said.The ministry is also banking on the Northern Water Collector Tunnel, which is 20 per cent complete, and is to provide an additional 140,000 cubic metres of water. Kidero urged residents to use water sparingly. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t have to use water, please don&rsquo;t. You don&rsquo;t need to wash your car every day. Let&rsquo;s not leave our taps running,&rdquo; he said.Wamalwa warned water vendors against taking advantage of the situation to overcharge residents. Some vendors, especially in slums, charge Sh80 to Sh100 for 20 litres of water.
