Nurses in Trans Nzoia have boycotted work since Friday, demanding the county government improve their welfare.The more than 700 nurses on Friday carried placards demanding &lsquo;We want promotions&rsquo; and complained of lack of promotions, delays in salaries and overworking due to shortage of nurses. They also cite lack of drugs in health centres.But Public Service Management executive Gaudencia Malimbe and her Health counterpart Isaac Kogo said they have addressed all but one grievance.Kogo said promotions have not been addressed because nurses have refused to do competency tests as required. He said they want to promote 238 nurses.Malimbe said nurses want a position of county chief nurse created, but it is not in the scheme of service.Negotiations between the county and union will begin today.
