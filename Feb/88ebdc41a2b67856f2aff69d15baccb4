Kakamega MCAs on Wednesday next week will hold a special sitting to debate the proposed Kakamega County Villages and Community Areas Bill.County assemblies are expected to resume sittings on February 14.The MCAs went on recess after they turned against the assembly leadership and threatened to impeach its service board.They accused the board of nepotism and recommending construction of a new assembly chambers on disputed property early this year.Clerk Patrick Kamwesser yesterday said the sitting was requested by majority leader Robert Makhanu.&ldquo;The report ought to have been discussed before the Christmas recess, but members did not. The session is important because the report must be approved by the assembly before recruitment of the village and community heads,&rdquo; he said.The report by the Public Service and Administration Committee chaired by Bukura MCA Reuben Nyangweso sets village units at between 180 and 240 households and community areas between 350 and 400.The report was prepared by the eight-member County Administrative Boundaries Committee appointed by Governor Wycliffe Oparanya in October last year to collect and collate views from residents on suitable boundaries.The committee was chaired by Joseph Kimutai. Its members included Odongo Kabita, Jacob Omumia, Phoebe Muleshe, Bernard Kiprotich, Hannington Munyendo, Silas Ondari and Aziza Rajab.The committee conducted public hearing guided by the size of wards and the 2009 population census, then proposed the number of units to be created.Launching the boundaries committee, Oparanya said creation of the village and community areas would improve services and representation at the grassroots.&ldquo;We want to do it differently from the national government, which turns to the provincial administration for security. The community units will deal with all departments at that level,&rdquo; Oparanya said.The governor said the county will recruit community heads before the August 8 general election.
