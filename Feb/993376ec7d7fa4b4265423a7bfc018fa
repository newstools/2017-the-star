Two Murang&rsquo;a residents have requested the High Court to suspend disbursement of funds to the county until their case challenging an alleged illegal expenditure is concluded. Peter Mwangi and Allan Mburu want the Controller of Budget stopped from approving implementation of the Murang&rsquo;a Supplementary Appropriation Act or authorising release of funds. They also want the law quashed. The two, in their suit papers, expressed concern over the law, which allows the county to transfer funds from development expenditure to recurrent expenditure. They say the fact that these activities are being undertaken in an election year shows there is a high likelihood the county MCAs and executives intend to use it as a ploy to loot public funds. &ldquo;The actions smack of impunity and disregard of the Constitution,&rdquo; the court was told.
