Jubilee Party leaders from Busia county have strongly condemned former Budalang'i MP Raphael Wanjala for allegedly colluding with Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong to reduce the party&rsquo;s popularity in the county.They accused the former legislator of persuading Jubilee supporters from Budalang'i constituency to defect to ODM.Busia Jubilee chairman Vincent Okochil and acting secretary Michael Kongo said Wanjala is claiming to have been discriminated against by the party&rsquo;s top organ.&ldquo;The former MP is using propaganda to claim that it is hard to sell the Jubilee manifesto in Budalang'i and we suspect he is avoiding party nominations for fear of losing to other aspirants with a lot of influence at the grassroots,&rdquo; Okochil said.The two leaders said the defection of Jubilee leaders and the former MP to ODM is inconsequential and will not affect the party as it still enjoys a lot of support.Meanwhile, Busia ODM chairman Patrick Obongoya has congratulated Wanjala and thousands of his supporters who ditched Jubilee for ODM on Wednesday.&ldquo;As the current county ODM supremo, I on behalf of all officials and members welcome you all to ODM with open arms,&rdquo; he said. Obongoya said ODM is the only political outfit that will transform Kenya.
