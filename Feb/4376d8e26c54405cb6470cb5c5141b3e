Opposition leaders are now manufacturing unnecessary excuses to derail the work of the IEBC, Deputy President William Ruto has said.Ruto said on Saturday that the leaders have resorted to threatening the electoral commission's staff.&ldquo;Our opponents have sensed defeat and are now manufacturing all manner of excuses to derail the IEBC from doing its work smoothly,&rdquo; he said.He spoke during voter registration drives in Oloitoktok, Kitengela, Isinya, Rongai and Kimana towns in Kajiado county.The DP said Cord leaders have changed goal posts and are making outrageous demands despite an agreement with government for new commissioners to be hired.Ruto said the government agreed to all reforms required for a free, fair and credible election but that the Opposition is erecting roadblocks.&ldquo;They now want to replace junior staff at IEBC with their relatives and friends. How can elections only be conducted by the people they want? Will that be fair? We want neutral people as is the case,&rdquo; he said.He told the Opposition to stop threatening commission staff with the hope of tilting scales in their favour.Uhuru has said this twice before and asked the Opposition, led by Cord leader Raila Odinga, to let the IEBC perform its duties without interference.&ldquo;You have to choose to either be a player or a referee. You cannot be both,&rdquo; he said in Nakuru county on Friday.More on this: Stop intimidation, let IEBC work, Uhuru tells OppositionRuto further said the Opposition thrives on lies and propaganda but that Jubilee is focused on development.He cited the upgrading of Oloitoktok and Kajiado medical facilities to referral hospitals and electricity supply to 165,000 households in the county, up from 91,000 in 2013.Regarding water shortage in the area, the DP said Kajiado Rural Water Supply Project will construct 40 boreholes.He said another water project for the area, which had been delayed because of a court case, was resolved and that work will soon begin.Ruto asked Kenyans to register as voters saying this was the only way to have a say in the election of leaders who will cater for their welfare.&ldquo;The only way for Kenyans to ensure development-conscious leaders are elected in August is by registering as voters. This will enable you to take part in shaping the future of this nation,&rdquo; he said.He urged the people to support Jubilee and become part of the "dependable team" that is motivated by the desire to develop Kenya.Ruto was accompanied by MPs Katoo ole Metito (Kajiado South), ODM's Mohamed Elmi (Wajir East), Peter Mositet (Kajiado) Moses ole Sakuda (Kajiado West), Peris Tobiko (Kajiado East), Mary Seneta (Women Rep, Kajiado), Yusuf Hassan (Kamukunji) and former Interior Cabinet Secretary Joseph ole Lenku.Metito said the Maasai community had benefited from the government&rsquo;s development projects and urged voters in the area to support Jubilee.&ldquo;The Maasai community is grateful for projects that have been initiated by Jubilee in sectors including energy, water, education and infrastructure,&rdquo; said Mr Metito.Read: Jubilee has done a lot for Maasais, Uhuru tells Kajiado leaders at State HouseAlso read: Raila meets Maasai leaders to quell Uhuru effect
