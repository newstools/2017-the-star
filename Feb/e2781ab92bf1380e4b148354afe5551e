Othaya Coffee Farmers Cooperative Society Ltd has installed a new advanced polisher and bucket elevator for milling coffee at a cost of Sh8 million.Chairman James Nderitu said the machine is able to mill 2,000kg of parchment coffee per hour compared to the previous one which could mill only 700kg an hour.He spoke in Othaya on Friday during the society's AGM.The society has already acquired a computerised commercial roaster and a grader all valued at Sh5.3 million.The roaster has a capacity to roast 70kg of coffee bean an hour while the grader will classify all types of grades.Other value addition machines also acquired include a manual horizon hand sealer, manual barcoding and laboratory hand sealer.&ldquo;All these machines will go a long way in enhancing complete value addition without any waste. The complete chain will improve coffee payments. We will be able to sell our coffee to supermarkets and other destinations,&rdquo; Nderitu told farmers.He said the company will in future build a modern warehouse to serve Nyeri and the neighbouring counties.Last year, President Uhuru Kenyatta toured the area and praised the society&rsquo;s efforts in value addition. He pledged to donate two machines &mdash; a colour sorter and automated packaging machine.
