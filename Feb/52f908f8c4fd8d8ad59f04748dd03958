Protest organisers and Samburu women who recently demonstrated against Cord leader Raila Odinga have been ordered to appear before elders on March 3 with a goat for a cleansing ceremony.Those who do not attend will be cursed, the more than 1,000 Samburu elders said at a meeting at Yamo grounds, Maralal town.The elders have also given a directive that no activity should take place at Kenyatta Stadium before the cleansing ceremony.The women held demonstrations at the stadium on February 8 against Raila criticising Samburu leaders for misusing public funds during a tour of Maralal and Baragoi. They burned and buried effigies of Raila.The elders said the women violated cultural values.Elder John Lopokopeny said the protest was an embarrassment. He said Samburu is a democratic county where every leader is respected and has the right to seek votes.
