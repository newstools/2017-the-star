Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago has dismissed as propaganda reports that he is planning to join Kanu for fear of flawed JP primaries.Through his communications director Silas Tarus, yesterday he blamed his rivals for circulating fake Kanu campaign posters bearing his name and portrait. &ldquo;We know those behind the propaganda but those are sideshows. The governor is firmly in Jubilee, ready for nominations and poised to win,&rdquo; Tarus said.This comes as Kanu inched closer to sealing a deal with former IG David Kimaiyo to join the party and run for Elgeyo Marakwet senator. Kimaiyo is expected to launch his campaign on February 25 in Iten town, where he will announce his party.&ldquo;I will join a party that brings together many Kenyans and is not inclined to any tribe or group,&rdquo; he said. There have been fears some JP leaders in the Rift Valley are considering joining CCM and Kanu.
