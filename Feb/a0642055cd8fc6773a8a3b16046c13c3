Three Nyanza leaders have warned Jubilee against intimidating Auditor General Edward Ouko (pictured) with sack threats for exposing corruption deals in the government.Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga, Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi and Rarieda MP Nicholas Gumbo said Jubilee has resorted to gagging independent institutions through sack threats.Rasanga said it is clear the government is not committed to combating corruption, going by the action it is not taking in the war on corruption.&ldquo;The current onslaught on the office of the Auditor General is a way of covering up massive corruption cases that have been uncovered in the past,&rdquo; Rasanga said. Public Accounts Committee chairman Nicholas Gumbo said the attack on Ouko is geared towards covering corrupt individuals in Jubilee.&ldquo;We will not allow the government to operate on individuals&rsquo; interests in the war on corruption to cover corrupt people at the expense of services,&rdquo; he said.Gumbo expressed concerns that the questioning of Ouko is not genuine, saying it is not the first time the Auditor General, who was cleared by the DPP, is on the receiving end. Speaking in Memba village in his Rarieda constituency, Gumbo said Kenya can only win the war on corruption if institutions of accountability and that of the AG are protected.&ldquo;The pressur being exerted by a certain group of individuals is aimed at pushing Ouko to resign, I want to discourage him from taking such actions,&rdquo; Gumbo said.
