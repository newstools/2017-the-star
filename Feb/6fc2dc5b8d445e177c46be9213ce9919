Kenya Railways Staff Retirement Benefit Scheme has paid out Sh200 million pension arrears to more than 8,500 pensioners.Scheme chief executive Simon Nyakundi yesterday said the last two years have been spent laying a firm foundation and rolling out a strategic plan to ensure the scheme recovers, adding it is on sound footing to better serve its members. &ldquo;We formulated a strategic plan two years ago, which included an aggressive campaign to collect all amounts owed to the scheme and to generate sufficient cash flow from the sale of a limited number of non-strategic properties in order to guarantee uninterrupted payment of monthly pension,&rdquo; Nyakundi said.&ldquo;We have seen this strategy start to bear fruit with the scheme managing to pay out every month as well as pay outstanding lump sums and arrears owed to pensioners. What you are seeing now are the low hanging fruits from a robust strategy.&rdquo;Recovery efforts have been hampered and slowed down by numerous court cases and injunctions, some of which have effectively prevented the scheme from proceeding with the sale of properties.Since its establishment, in 2006, the scheme has faced major challenges including unpaid pension arrears and delays in the payment of monthly pension due to a shortfall in liquidity. Despite being rich in property based assets, disposal of these assets has been slow thus the scheme has had to rely only on rental income, which fell short of the cash needed to cover the monthly pay out.The scheme has been faced by unique challenges since inception as it started operations with 100 per cent property-based assets.Whereas the liability was immediate, rental income from property was not able to adequately cover for pension payment.Nyakundi said by putting in place proper mechanisms and systems, the rental income has increased from Sh26 million to about Sh50 million, enabling the scheme to strengthen its capacity to pay monthly pension.&ldquo;We are not there yet as our pension payroll is Sh73 million while the rental collection is 50 million. The next phase of the strategy is to cover the deficit by realigning the portfolio in order to get over Sh25 million from investment income,&rdquo; he said.While the final phase of the strategy will be to redevelop the estates either for retention or disposal to the general public at competitive market rates. We, management of the scheme, together with the trustees of the scheme are confident that the scheme is firmly on the recovery path and are committed to see it stable,&rdquo; Nyakundi said .&ldquo;A lot of hard work and consultative efforts from corporate and pension trust services, a wholly owned subsidiary of Alexander Forbes, has gone into enabling the scheme to pay out the outstanding arrears for the lump sum and continues to remit the monthly pension.&rdquo;
