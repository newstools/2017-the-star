Dagoretti North MP hopeful Carnicius Meso has urged residents to support Jubilee. He told residents on Sunday to register in large numbers so JP can retain power on August 8. &ldquo;Many people prefer going home during elections. This time I&rsquo;m appealing to you not to go. Stay around and vote for leaders of your choice,&rdquo; he told a gathering in Kawangware. The mass voter listing ends today despite pleas by politicians that the IEBC extend the deadline. The poll agency has said it will not extend it and will not be able to meet its six million target. By last week, only 2.1 million new voters had been listed. &ldquo;Dagoretti North must go Jubilee. I, Meso, am the man for the job. I&rsquo;m doing what no Jubilee aspirant has done and I am going places, where no Dagoretti North aspirant is willing to go. I will deliver this seat to Jubilee,&rdquo; Meso said. The seat is currently held by ODM&rsquo;s Simba Arati. He will defend it.
