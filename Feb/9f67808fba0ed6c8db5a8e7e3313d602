Nyanza hopefuls have been warned against transferring voters en masse.This comes amid a probe of aspirants ferrying voters from Kisumu East to Kisumu Central constituencies. On Thursday, Nyanza Central IEBC coordinator George Oyugi said legal action will be taken against politicians importing voters.He said they will vet all transfer applications to establish whether they are genuine or motivated by politicians keen on increasing potential votes.Kisumu Central MP hopeful Fred Ouda raised the alarm over massive voter importation. On Thursday, Oyugi said, &ldquo;Transfer of voters for political reasons is unacceptable. Citizens have the right to choose where they want to vote, but it must be done within the stipulated election laws.&rdquo;He asked Ouda to avail evidence of politically motivated voter transfer for investigation.On Wednesday, Ouda said two aspirants were transferring voters instead of mobilising eligible voters to get listed.Ouda said he will forward the names of aspirants whom he did not mention to authorities for investigation. Ouda, former Kisumu mayor Sam Okello, former TNA boss Onyango Oloo and Richard Ogendo want to unseat incumbent MP Ken Obura. They will battle for the ODM ticket.&ldquo;It is unfortunate to find that only two or three new voters are listed in a day while voters transfer range between 600 to 700 votes,&rdquo; Ouda said.He urged Cord leader Raila Odinga and Kisumu Governor Jack Ranguma to speak out against voter importation.Ouda named St Paul Kanyakwar, Kondele and Kosawo polling stations where voters from other areas were being transferred to. He said those behind the transfer have taken IEBC forms to villages and hired youths to conduct transfers.
