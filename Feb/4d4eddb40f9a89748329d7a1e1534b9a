The family of the late Makueni Senator Mutula Kilonzo, who have been feuding over his vast estate, have agreed to settle the dispute out of court.Mutula&rsquo;s children and his widow appeared before High Court judge Rose Ougo and agreed on mediation to resolve the dispute.They told the judge they will settle on a mediator in the coming days to resolve the matter.The late Education minister died in April 2013 at his expansive Maanzoni farm in Machakos county and was succeeded by his son Mutula Kilonzo Jnr as senator.When the matter came up yesterday, the family, led by Cyrose Nduku and lawyer Kethi Kilonzo, said they were willing to talk over the issues out of court.Ougo gave them two weeks to agree on the mediator and go back to court on March 21 for further directions.Mutula left a will, but his children from his first marriage moved to court, opposing a decision by their step-mother, Nduku, to single-handedly divide the property.Jnr&rsquo;s siblings want him appointed as a second executor of their father&rsquo;s will.The family is also yet to agree on how to divide some properties they allege were left out in the list of properties owned by Kilonzo, prepared by Nduku.In the application, the children had asked the court to restrain Nduku from disposing or transferring shares of all private companies of the estate until the issues are resolved.In response, Nduku, who was left as the sole executioner of the estate, said she has nothing to hide and will avail a just and true account of the estate and administer it according to the law.Among the properties to be shared by the family include 30 parcels of land in Nairobi and Machakos and liabilities worth only Sh40 million, stocks and shares in more than 30 companies, vehicles, gold, jewelry, watches, parliamentary dues and liabilities.
