The National Land Commission is in the process of reclaiming 33 acres of public land in Juja town.The prime land was allegedly grabbed by former chief Francis Ndung&rsquo;u, now deceased. He subdivided and sold plots to unsuspecting investors. His heir refuses to relinquish it, saying he is the legal owner.The land had been set aside for a market, a polytechnic, a nursery school, public toilets, a church, a police station and deputy county commissioner&rsquo;s office. The NLC is holding a week-long public hearing over lands acquired illegally in Kiambu.Chairman Muhammad Swazuri and Juja MP Francis Waititu toured the land on Monday.Swazuri said residents and the Kiambu government petitioned the commission to authenticate whether the land was acquired lawfully. &ldquo;We invited those claiming to have plots on this disputed tract, but they gave unsatisfactory explanations on how they acquired the land. Documents presented to us by complainants revealed the land was public property,&rdquo; he said.Swazuri said the commission will give the occupants a three-month notice to vacate. &ldquo;On this matter, there are no further discussions and anyone claiming to have plots should vacate by April 30,&rdquo; Swazuri said. &ldquo;If they decline to leave, we will evict them forcibly.&rdquo;MP Waititu said the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology had once volunteered to collaborate with the national government to put up a polytechnic on the land, but were held back by the disputes.The MP said there is no public land to build government offices in the constituency. Waititu claimed the former chief&rsquo;s son, Ken Ngumba, has refused to give back the public property. &ldquo;It has been revealed the land is a public property but the heir has declined to give it back to Juja residents,&rdquo; he said.Ngumba said documents proving ownership are legal and intact.
