As the voter registration comes to an end today, the Luo and Luhya communities living in Kiuu ward, Kiambu county, have accused area chief of denying them IDs.The allegations were made by James Omollo, ODM party representative for Ruiru constituency, during a press conference in Kiambu town on Monday.He said some members of "certain communities" do not have IDs and cannot therefore register as voters."As we are mobilising people to register as voters, someone somewhere is busy chasing members of certain communities from getting IDs. This has been brought to our attention and the communities are scared to report as they fear no one will listen to them," Omollo said.Resident Lawi Otieno said he has lived in Githurai 45 for six years, but when he accompanied his wife to the area chief to apply for an ID, they were chased away.He said they were told that their documents were not in order and they should apply the ID from where they come from."My wife was chased away by the chief who said that her documents indicate she is from the border .... as no Luo or Luhya community will apply in the area. But some people were allowed to apply for IDs after they gave out something small to the chief," Otieno said.Others who spoke said they are afraid to come out and speak out since they fear being victimised, saying the area is a "Jubilee zone".County ODM chairman George Wanyugi said some leaders have been giving youths handouts to transfer their voters cards elsewhere."Our message to Kiambu youths is that your vote is your choice," he said.County party secretary Charles Mbugua requested the youths to register in large numbers as voters.He said ODM Kiambu branch will field candidates in every seat."We have been educating people to register as voters. The party is gaining more members as there are many people who are in support of our party leader," Mbugua said.
