Kisii Governor James Ongwae has dismissed his critics and told them to examine his development record before spreading lies about him.He urged residents to be wary of his rivals, &ldquo;evaluate their track records and ask them what they have done to improve your lives for them to deserve to be elected.&rdquo; Ongwae was addressing mourners in Ogembo, Bobasi constituency, during the burial of chief officer Henry Nyachoka&rsquo;s mother.&ldquo;I urge you to shun leaders who spread propaganda over my development record. Ask them what they have done for you,&rdquo; he said on Friday. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good for you to elect leaders based on their scorecards.&rdquo;Ongwae is facing competition from Chris Obure, Lumumba Nyaberi, Boniface Omboto and Manson Nyamweya. Unconfirmed reports indicate deputy Governor Joash Maangi, who had declared a run for the seat, has dropped out in favour of Obure. Ongwae said he has done a lot in the four years he has been in office and deserves reelection.&ldquo;Some of those who are challenging me have been serving in elected office for over 40 years. I&rsquo;ve been in office for four years, but I&rsquo;ve done a lot,&rdquo; he said.Ongwae said he is in ODM to stay and dismissed defectors as self-seeking. He urged residents to go to the polls with an open mind, saying they should not be wooed by bribes.The county chief said he has fulfilled most of the pledges he made in 2013, but added some projects have stalled because of underfunding.
