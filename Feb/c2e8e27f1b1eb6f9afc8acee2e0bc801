Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago yesterday said NASA, Kanu and CCM have no influence in the Rift Valley.He said NASA will not make any impact in the Rift Valley, even if Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto and Baringo Senator Gideon Moi join it. Mandago said Rutto, Moi and other Rift Valley leaders who support NASA are committing political suicide, because they will not win the election. &ldquo;Rift Valley is a Jubilee stronghold and NASA is wasting time campaigning in this region. We already made our decision that we belong to Jubilee and nothing will change that,&rdquo; Mandago said in Eldoret. He said Rutto and Gideon will not upstage Deputy President William Ruto in Rift Valley politics. &ldquo;We are behind Jubilee, President Uhuru Kenyatta and Ruto. Kanu or the so-called CCM have no place in this region and should not be allowed to confuse anyone,&rdquo; Mandago said.NASA hosted its first rally in Bomet last week, an indication that Rutto may eventually join the opposition. But Mandago told the governor to tread carefully and join NASA at his own risk. He spoke after a meeting between the Kalenjin and Kikuyu elders. The elders were led by Major (Rtd) John Seii and Joseph Keriri,The participants said communities in the region must ensure peace prevails.
