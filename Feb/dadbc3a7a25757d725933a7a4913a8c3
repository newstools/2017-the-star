Sirisia MP John Waluke on Tuesday confronted his archrival ODM&rsquo;s Moses Nandalwe at the Hotel Intercontinental, Nairobi. There has been bad blood between the two since Nandalwe lost to Waluke in 2013. &ldquo;I was having supper with my friends, my personal assistant Onesmus Mukhwana, MP Kabuchai Lusweti, Webuye West MP Dan Wanyama and Trans Nzoia Senator Henry Ndiema, when Waluke appeared from nowhere, ignored my colleagues&rsquo; [outstretched hands] came straight at me and attacked me. It took the intervention of Hon Lusweti to end the chaos,&rdquo; Nandalwe said yesterday. Waluke could not be reached for comment as his phone was switched off. Nandalwe said he will report Waluke to the IEBC if he continues attacking him. &ldquo;As a legal expert I understand my rights,&rdquo; he said. Sources say Waluke, who supports Jubilee, feels threatened by the NASA wave that has swept the constituency. Nandalwe leads the NASA team.
