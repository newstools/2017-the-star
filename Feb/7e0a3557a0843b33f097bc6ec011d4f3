A woman with a three-day-old baby was shot dead on Monday in Natan village, Baringo, by suspected Pokot armed bandits.Josephine Kiptoon had been breastfeeding her baby when the attackers arrived.She was among hundreds of residents fleeing Yatya, Kagir and Natan, which have turned into battlefields. The bandits opened fire at 2pm. This lasted for six hours.&ldquo;People had ran into hiding. The woman was left trying to strap her child on her back when the bandits caught up with her, shooting her dead,&rdquo; resident Richard Chepchomei said.This brings the death toll to four. Six others were injured. The attacks have been ongoing in Baringo North and South subcounties.Chepchomei said tension is high in the area after the armed rustlers also injured one person, torched 10 houses, before fleeing with unknown number of livestock towards Kositei in Tiaty subcounty.He said displaced residents camped with their children and livestock in Kapkomon, Rondinin, Sibilo and Tebengar and are in dire need of food, water, shelter and clothing. More than 800 victims have also camped in Mochongoi and Kabel, Baringo South.&ldquo;I blame all this on politicians from Pokot who incite the illiterate youth to carry out retaliatory attacks on innocent people after the recent murder of Loyamorok MCA Kibet Cheretei and MP aspirant Pepe Kitambaa&rdquo; he said.Baringo North police boss Ndiema Chemongis said more security officers have been deployed to beef up security.He urged residents to calm down as officers repulse the armed rustlers and recover stolen livestock.MP William Cheptumo yesterday urged the government to move fast and restore peace, adding that the attacks have disrupted learning in schools.He said Kagir, Chemoe, Ngaratuko, Kosile, Yatya primary schools remain closed as the bandits have a field day killing people and stealing property.Rift Valley regional coordinator Wanyama Musiambo condemned the killings and said the government is doing everything possible to arrest the culprits.He urged residents to provide information so they can resolve the problem and recover stolen animals.
