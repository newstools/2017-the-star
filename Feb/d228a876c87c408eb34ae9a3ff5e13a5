Schools in the Western Region have been urged to invest and develop students&rsquo; talent in individual sports like the racket games, swimming and athletics.Three counties from the former &lsquo;Nzoia&rsquo; region have been fenced off to form western region. Together with Trans Nzoia, West Pokot and Turkana Counties, Western region had been the leading performer for a long time and the detached trio significantly contributed to the feat.&ldquo;We have been leading nationally as &lsquo;Nzoia&rsquo; region but with the three counties now separated from us, schools in western region have to spread their wings if they are to maintain the feat. With the restructuring of the KSSSA regions, schools in our region will have to diversify and develop talents in individual games,&rdquo; Robert Mukhwana, the region&rsquo;s secretary general said on Tuesday during Western Region&rsquo;s annual general meeting held at St. Peter&rsquo;s Boys Mumias.He said St Peter&rsquo;s Mumias will host the region&rsquo;s Term One games featuring rugby 15s, basketball, hockey and cross country. Due to lack of aquatic facilities for competitions in Kakamega County, swimming will be held either at Mudasa Academy in Majengo, Vihiga County, or Friends School Kamusinga.Term Two &lsquo;A&rsquo; event will be staged in Busia County at three venues including St Mathias, St. Mary&rsquo;s Boys, Mundika and the Busia Municipal Stadium. The Airtel Rising Stars are set for Bungoma County at a yet to be agreed on venue.
