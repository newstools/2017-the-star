The government will roll out a caging project in Siaya county to increase fish catch in Lake Victoria.Culture PS Joe Okudo said traditional fishing methods can no longer be relied on to improve yields.&ldquo;Communities have to adopt large-scale rearing of fish in metal cages to ensure a reliable income, even though it is capital-intensive,&rdquo; he said.Okudo said traditional fishing methods are a one-way extraction technique because there is no effort put into restocking the fish population.He spoke during a meeting with 50 representatives of youth and cooperative societies in Bondo Town on Saturday.Okudo said ovefishing, use of unapproved nets, water hyacinth infestation and failure to observe the fishing embargoes during the breeding seasons are reasons for poor catch.
