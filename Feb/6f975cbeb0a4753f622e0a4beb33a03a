American alto saxophinist and six-time Grammy Award winner David Sanborn delighted fans at a packed Kasarani Training Grounds with a two-hour long set Sunday evening, blasting through his extensive catalogue. Sanborn who was the headlining act at the Safaricom International Jazz festival gave thousands of music fans who were present at the venue a spectacular display. Before he rocked the audience, other major acts on the line-up got their opportunity to entertain the massive crowd with performances kicking off at noon. Kenya's Nairobi Horns Projects collaborated with clarinetist Arun Ghosh from Britain providing a powerful performance. The Kenyan trio then finished their show with an instrumental rendition of old school Kenyan hits including E-Sir's "Boomba Train". Congolese virtuoso Ray Lema and the Saka Saka band got the crowd dancing with energetic performance of Jazz tunes combined with rhumba. Israel's all-girl trio The Hazelnuts, accompanied by their band, delivered stirring vocals to the delight of the festival-goers. The ladies paved the way for the jazz legend and headliner David Sanborn.  Having contracted polio at the age of three, David Sanborn played his saxophone perched on the edge of a stool for most of his performance. The 71-year-old artiste was accompanied by Ramon Yslas on Percussion, Richard Patterson on bass and Nicky Moroch on guitar among other instrumentalist. The entire ensemble offered enthusiasts with a well-organized and brilliantly done performance. Other bands that thrilled fans in the Festival were the TaxiWars from Belgium, Bokani Dyer trio from South Africa, Shamsi Music from Kenya. By the end of the show, the venue was crowded with attendees full of excitement and resounding applause.
