Grammy nominated star Rocky Dawuni is in town.The Ghanaian born hitmaker is a happy man. He is celebrating a big breakthrough in his music career.Speaking to Word Is, Rocky announced, "One of my songs from the Grammy nominated album, Branches Of The Same Tree, the song is called Shine A Light, is in a movie premiering today. The movie is called Fist Fight staring Ice Cube and it is a worldwide premiere. It is an incredible piece of news to share here in Kenya on the eve of another concert i'm doing. I'm honoured and excited about it." He continued saying that scoring in TV shows and movies is no mean feat. " If an album resonates and is heard in different places then it comes to the attention of the producers who always look for a certain type of music," he said, "This song also incorporates various styles, it has reggae but at the same time it is inspired by New Orleans style and Brazillian Samba. It is all part of my ability to be able to fuse different types of music, rhythmically. It was amazing an amazing anthem." Rocky added, "I have also had a lot of music in TV shows from ER to Dexter also on a lot of global video games. It has been incredible to get my music on those platforms.&nbsp;As a musician, you are constantly looking for avenues for exposure and for TV, it is one of the most powerful." The visiting star will be bringing the house down tonight Saturday 18, at Alchemist where he will perform his single, Nairobi, off his Grammy nominated album, for the very first time in Kenya.
