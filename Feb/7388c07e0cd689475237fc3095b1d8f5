Mombasa Court of Appeal has upheld a seven-year jail sentence handed to two police officers accused of murdering 14-year-old Kwekwe Mwandaza in 2014.Judge Asike Makhandia on Friday said the court could not interfere with the High Court judgment issued on February 10, 2016.The judge said the killing of the 14 year old girl was contrary to the National Police Service Act and therefore dismissed their appeal."The National security is to be pursued in compliant with the law and force used must be proportional to the subject," Makhandia said.Kinango DCIO Veronicah Gitahi and constable Issa Mzee were found guilty of committing the offense on August 22, 2014, at Kinango in Kwale county.They were jailed for seven years by High Court judge Martin Muya for manslaughter.Making the ruling, the judge decried the "rampant use of firearms among Kenya police" and said the officers will be jailed for manslaughter.Read: Two officers found guilty of manslaughter in Kwekwe Mwandaza's caseHe said the two officers were "reckless and wanton" in their discharge of duty."I find the two accused persons guilty of the offence of manslaughter and they should be sentenced accordingly. They should have made any effort to avoid using a firearm on a child," ruled judge Martin Muya."There is evidence that this child was shot in the head and chest. The child should have been disarmed either physically or shot in the hand to disarm her."They denied the charge when they appeared in court in November 2015, saying their intention was not to shoot Kwekwe but that she charged at them with a panga.Their version of events differed with the family's testimonies.Kwekwe's cousin told the court that 13 police officers stormed their home in Maweu village and lobbed teargas canisters.They said police opened fire and shot the girl as the family choked in fumes.Read: Kwekwe cousins testify as court visits sceneKwekwe died of a gunshot wound to the head from a high-powered rifle and another shot into the chest.Manslaughter refers to the killing of a person without premeditation or in circumstances not amounting to murder and attracts a prison sentence of at least 12 months, plus fines and probation.Muya also said Gitahi and Mzee did not indicate in their submissions that they saw Kwekwe swing a panga. In their defense, the officers said they went to Maweu during an operation to pursue criminals.Gitahi said they forcefully got into the house after its occupants declined to open the door. He said Kwekwe cut Mzee's AK 47 rifle with a panga, prompting her to shoot twice in the air.Also read: Police officers handed seven years in jail for killing 14 year old Kwekwe Mwandaza
