Survivors of the 2011 Sinai slum fire that claimed more than 100 lives yesterday lost a Sh25 billion compensation case.Justice Edward Muriithi crushed the hope of victims who sued the government over the September 12, 2011, tragedy following an oil spill from the Kenya Pipeline Corporation pipes.The judge said although the court sympathises with the survivors, compensation at this stage is out of question since they did not file a proper suit.To get compensated, the judge said the victims would each have to prove their individual loss as well as establish the liability for the court to grant orders.&ldquo;I am unable to find that the petitioner has made out a case that shows a failure by the respondents (Nairobi county overnment and the AG) to protect the rights guaranteed under the Constitution,&rdquo; the judge said.The judge, however, directed the county government to include Sinai settlement as part of the slum upgrading and prevention programmes to &ldquo;relocate them or otherwise compensate them&rdquo; to clear the Kenya pipeline wayleave.&ldquo;Residents may be removed subject to adequate and reasonable notice,&rdquo; he said.The fire in Sinai broke out after oil leaked from a malfunctioning pipe at the firm&rsquo;s depot into trenches in the densely populated settlement. A number of survivors were hospitalised for long periods and wanted the court to award them damages. On October 31, 2014, the court temporarily stopped planned evictions of the residents after Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko, who was then Makadara MP, filed the suit on behalf of the survivors. Muriithi was of the view that the government took reasonable measures to meet the victims&rsquo; obligations.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not possible on the basis of the material before me to discern any failure on the part of the respondent to fulfil their constitutional obligation,&rdquo; the judge saidHe found no merit in the petition and dismissed it.More than 300 residents drawn from Hazina, Mukuru Kayaba, Tetra Pack and Sinai had sworn affidavits stating how they have lined in the area for more than 40 years and were victims of negligence by the Kenya Pipeline Company.
