Police in Kabete by last evening were yet to establish the identities of four men killed and their bodies left in a vehicle in King&rsquo;eero on Wednesday night.The bodies were found inside a Toyota Probox parked by the roadside.Curious residents peeped through the car&rsquo;s tinted windows and informed police on Wednesday at around 10pm after they noticed there were corpses inside.Detectives did not find any documents that could help to identify the four.They took fingerprints and forwarded to the National Registration Bureau.The dead are, however, estimated to be aged between 25 and 30 years.Last evening, the owner of the vehicle presented himself at the Kikuyu police station and reported that his car had been stolen.He said the vehicle was stolen from a parking yard in Kikuyu town on Wednesday night.It could not be immediately established why the man filed the report close to 48 hours after the alleged theft.Police said the deceased appeared to have been strangled to death and had visible injuries in their necks and faces.One had also nose-bled, an indication of possible torture and beating before death.Kabete police chief Joseph Ongaya yesterday said two victims were stashed in the boot and another two behind the driver&rsquo;s seat.This indicates the vehicle was possibly driven to the scene after the men had been killed.Ongaya, who spoke to the Star on the phone, said investigators suspect the men were killed elsewhere and brought to Gitaru at the Kikuyu town junction on the Nairobi-Nakuru highway.He said the deceased appeared to have been hit using blunt objects.The shocking murder comes barely a week after police commanders were criticised by their seniors for rising crime in parts of Kikuyu and Wangige.Central region police chief Larry Kiyeng toured the police station and met police commanders over rising insecurity. The bodies were taken to City Mortuary for postmortem as investigations continue.No one has been arrested in connection with the bizarre incident.
