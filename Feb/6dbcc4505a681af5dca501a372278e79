Meru Senator Kiraitu Murungi has said Governor Peter Munya&rsquo;s administration lacks ideas and obstructs development. He said once he is elected governor, he will improve local revenue to ensure the county has more funds for development. Kiraitu said he will reestablish cotton zones along the Meru-Isiolo and Meru Tharaka-Nithi borders, which he called poverty zones.&ldquo;We spend over Sh800 million to buy sanitary pads, yet their production is easy and we can produce enough cotton easily,&rdquo; he said. Kiraitu said he has borrowed good ideas from other countries on value addition, especially on bananas.These can be used to make wine, beer and fabric. He said he will partner with foreign investors.
