The man behind a plot to force Auditor General Edward Ouko out of office takes the hot seat today to defend his petition before a parliamentary team.The Finance, Planning and Trade committee will this morning take evidence from petitioner Emanuel Mwagambo.Mwagambo last week submitted to Parliament his petition annexed with evidence, but the committee has the mandate to interrogate if the grounds cited meet the requisite threshold for the removal from office of Ouko.He has accused Ouko of gross violation of the Constitution by failing to submit timely audit reports to Parliament, skewed employment and violation of procurement rules.The committee chaired by Ainamoi MP Benjamin Lang&rsquo;at has its work cut out."We will look at the petition and the evidence objectively. I promise Kenyans that we will be guided by the evidence tabled and nothing less," the MP said.If the committee is satisfied that the grounds meet the merit level, then it will compile a report recommending that Parliament compels the President to form a tribunal to probe Ouko.Ouko will be forced to step aside to pave way for investigations into his alleged crimes, once a tribunal is set up.The Auditor general's term ends in 2019 and he can only be removed from office through a tribunal.Mwagambo has come under immense scrutiny that he could be a hatchet man working at the whims of shadowy individuals, pushing for the sacking of Ouko over audit reports.Some of the audit reports have unearthed massive corruption within government agencies, often making him the subject of sustained onslaught from the state, which has been critical of the reports.However, Mwagambo who will be fighting to be his own man before the key committee, has submitted several grounds, which he wants confirmed to start Ouko&rsquo;s exit from office.
