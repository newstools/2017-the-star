Kitui Senator David Musila has been urged to heed Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka&rsquo;s advice that he drop his bid for governor.Governor Julius Malombe said Musila will face a &ldquo;humiliating&rdquo; defeat if he runs against him. Speaking at Mumbuni trading centre in Mwingi Central constituency on Friday, Malombe said Musila should seek reelection as senator. &ldquo;Personally I want to be reelected and secure my position because of my development record. Musila and former Lands CS Charity Ngilu are still eyeing the seat in vain,&rdquo; he said.Malombe added, &ldquo;Some were tested elsewhere and had top seats which they could have used to develop Kitui but they did nothing. Musila has been in power for over 10 years but what has he done? He is just after staying in power and I wonder if he can make it due to his age.&rdquo;Malombe said he and Musila are both Kalonzos friends, so he should not take offence from the Wiper leader&rsquo;s request that he seek reelection as senator.He said he will win 85 per cent of votes and Ngilu and Musila will share the 15 per cent left. &ldquo;I am very sure I will humiliate them come August,&rdquo; Malombe said.Last week, Musila said he will run for governor with or without the support of Kalonzo.He accused the Wiper leader of meddling. Musila also said he is not too old to run for the top seat.Last week, Mwingi Central MP Joe Mutambu urged Musila to leave Wiper and join Jubilee or risk being locked out of the primaries. Musila expressed confidence he will win the race for governor, adding that residents support him.
