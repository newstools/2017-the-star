Early on a Sunday morning, we awoke before 4am, packed the car and headed to the park. The early start was worth the effort, as we found a lion feasting on a fresh wildebeest kill in the Athi basin near the hippo pools. We sat almost mesmerised as we watched the lion (known as Sirikoi) feasting on fresh flesh less than 10m from the road. Naturally we took many photos and a few short videos.Then a thought occurred to me as many other day visitors and tourists arrived at the kill sight (technology like WhatsApp and Facebook causes info to move quickly). Wow! We humans are kind of crazy in a way. Many of us really enjoy seeing a prime predator like lions in the wild, and find it even more of a thrill when we see a kill, especially if it is quite close. Lions must also eat. People travel to Africa from all over the world in the hope that they can perhaps see lions in their natural habitat. Then it is extra special if they see some lion action as well, as lions are known to be inactive for up to 18 hours a day. Seen from a humorous point of view, imagine if some guests went to a restaurant and ordered a large beef steak cooked, very rare. Then imagine that news of this incident travelled quickly and people flocked to see the person devouring a meal of meat and began taking photos and recording videos of the gastronomic event. Mmm&hellip; That will never happen. However, the real attraction is to go to wild natural places, where lions roam free, in the hope of a brief sighting of a kill thrill!The park is open daily from 06h00 to 19h00.
