The Nairobi county government yesterday issued a number of bylaws to guide the forthcoming general election campaigns. It is good to have bylaws made by the county government, but it should stick to its powers and jurisdictions.Among the things City Hall has banned is addressing rallies in mother tongue. Your first language is the language you were exposed to within the critical formative period of childhood. What City Hall has ordered is an infringement on free speech and thoroughly misguided.A first language is a language that a person has been exposed to within the critical formative period of childhood. The fine of Sh300,000 prescribed by the new bylaws is over the top.Erecting any campaign materials anywhere in Nairobi without City Hall&rsquo;s permission ought not to happen (some posters and billboards actually block road signs or building entrances and shop display windows). This is a good bylaw and within City Hall&rsquo;s jurisdiction.
