[The current governor...he cannot unite people and serve their interests," he said in Msambweni.More on this: Jubilee wins big in Coast as Mvurya ditches ODMAlso read: Joho team trashes Jubilee in Coast after UhuRuto's massive campaignsMwakwere earlier told the Star that his move to join the Opposition resulted from a decision by members of the public."You go where your people are and that is exactly what I did. It is not because I feared Mvurya because even if he did not leave ODM, I would have faced it off with him through a Wiper ticket," he said.But Mvurya dismissed his bid in an address last week."I am told there are people preparing a homecoming from Lunga Lunga but they have no chance in Kwale," he said.Others who have shown interest in the governor seat include speaker Sammy Ruwa, Nicholas Zani, Gereza Dena, Issa Chipera and Mwachai Mwarapayo.
