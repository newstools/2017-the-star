Jamie Vardy overhit his cross and Riyad Mahrez chased it all the way to the far corner in a way that seemed strangely unfamiliar. Christian Fuchs arrived at pace and the pair exchanged urgent passes. Fuchs centred, perfectly, and there was Vardy to head Leicester's third.'Leicester City,' sang the fans, 'we know what we are.' Indeed we do; but the players would get very upset if we said it. For this was a performance that bore as much resemblance to what we have seen from this group recently, as Leicester 2015-16 does to the campaign so far.Bar this game. For here were Leicester back to their best. Claudio's away, and now the mice will play. Leicester defeated Liverpool by an even greater margin than in this fixture last year &ndash; 3-1 instead of 2-0 &ndash; and it could have been more. Vardy looked one of the best goalscorers in the Premier League again, the defence were forceful and tight, even Mahrez put in a shift.
