Nyatike MP Edick Anyanga wants officers from the Kenya Navy stationed at the disputed Migingo Island to quell simmering tension in the area.The legislator asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to order the deployment of the officers as a way of protecting the country's sovereignty.There is disquiet at the tiny island after news emerged of plans by Uganda to station new military officers to man the area.Migingo is endowed with abundant supply of fish, hence the interest between Kenya and Uganda on its location.While Kenya has maintained that the 0.5 acre rock is in its territory, its neighbour says the waters bordering the island is theirs.But Anyanga said a plan by Uganda to withdraw the existing marine officers at the island and replace them with a new batch has sparked anxiety.He questioned the timing of the changes especially with the planned August 8 poll, adding that he suspects a plot by Uganda to interfere with the general election."We have complaints of harassment of Kenyans living along the border with Uganda in Western and Nyanza," Anyanga said.Read: Kenya, Uganda hold security meeting in Migingo "We need a strong statement from Kenya in regard to soldiers crossing over into the country to met atrocities against citizens," the MP said.Anyanga said Lake Victoria is considered an international water body, hence needs to be shielded by Kenya Defence Forces."The request for the Navy is long overdue. We passed the motion during the 10th parliament to the effect," the legislator said on phone on Wednesday.The MP said that the matter needs to be resolved once and for all so that the livelihoods of those who depend on the water is not disrupted.John Obunge, Migingo beach management unit chairman, said the reports of the planned reinforcement has created a difficult business environment for fishermen.Jackson Otieno, a resident, said that Uganda has deployed more police in the island beyond the 12 required of each country."Ugandans security are often intimidating their Kenyan counterparts. We are afraid as we read in Ugandan media that the number will exceed 100," Otieno said.They also complained that the situation has made it difficult for the Island to be gazetted as a polling station.Ugandan Monitor newspaper on Tuesday reported that Uganda security authorities have finalised plans to replace officers who have been stationed at Migingo.The officers, according to the press reports, are being changed on grounds that they have been involved in illegal activities at the island.Migori police boss David Kirui said Uganda's decision to change the police officers was a normal occurrence and wont affect security in the island.In January, month more than 1,000 Kenyan traders and fishermen from the island moved to court to compel the government to remove the Ugandan police.They sued the National Security Council, the Defence Council, Kenya Defence Forces, Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Interior, Director of Public Prosecutions and Attorney General.More on this: Send your rep to court over Migingo Island case, AG directed
