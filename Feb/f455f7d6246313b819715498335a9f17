Jubilee Party has asked Cord leader Raila Odinga to tell Kenyans the truth behind the alleged extortion of an American investor in Siaya.Secretariat boss Raphael Tuju said Raila and his family were adversely named in the 22-page statement by Dominion Farms, owned and managed by Calvin Burgess.&ldquo;Nyanza has been lagging behind due to such behavior. It is time Raila opened up to Kenyans and explained his position. His silence should end tomorrow when he comes back to the city after campaigns,&rdquo; he said.Tuju said the fight on corruption was the responsibility of all Kenyans and that Raila, as Opposition leader and a strong presidential candidate, must clear his name first.He said the press conference by Bergees, which goons allegedly hired by ODM stormed "men in black style", raised serious allegations, and that Raila should explain instead of "using his family members to deflect attention to Jubilee".&ldquo;When Ruth Odinga, the [Kisumu Deputy Governor and sister to the former Prime Minister, is accused of not paying for rice in a business arrangement gone wrong...we recognise the sensational value of that statement but we would not like to be involved in the matter simply because it is a private business arrangement," he said."Madam Ruth Oding, like all Kenyans has a right to engage in legitimate business."Read: Dominion boss grilled over MoU on rice farmTuju noted that there will be consequences when investors are convinced that a region is hostile and full of extortionists."It will have negative impacts Kisumu and the greater Luo Nyanza, and those to suffer the consequences are the millions of unemployed youth,&rdquo; he said at the party's headquarters in Nairobi on Sunday.National Assembly Majority leader Aden Duale said Raila had failed in his capacity as Opposition chief.&ldquo;We have actually demanded Bergees be accorded all privileges when he appears at the Parliament committee, the CID and the Ethics and Anti-corruption commission,&rdquo; he said.Burgess, whos is Dominion Farms Chief Executive Officer, said the leaders frustrated his business.Siaya county leaders defended Raila against claims that he demanded a bribe from Burgess.The CEO accused the Opposition leader of demanding money to fund his campaigns for the 2007 general elections.He also claimed Raila frustrated plans to reclaim and resettle residents of Siaya in the Yala swamp after he sought to gain political support from the businessman which he denied him.But Governor Cornel Rasanga dismissed the allegations as 'ridiculous', saying Burgess was tainting Raila's name. Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo said it was unfortunate that the CEO was depicting Raila as a corrupt leader. He added that Burgess was being used by the Jubilee administration to tarnish Raila's name.More on this: Siaya leaders defend Raila against 'conman' Dominion CEO over bribery claimsAlso read: Midiwo accuses Rasanga of pocketing Sh70 million in Yala Swamp lease deal
