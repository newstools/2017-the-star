Politicians inciting their supporters against their rivals and other communities in rallies ahead of the August 8 general elections will face full force of the law, Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery has warned.Nkaissery told a parliamentary committee on National Security that his ministry has bought recording gadgets for security officers to use in monitoring persons propagating hate speech and incitement to destabilize the country."We will arm our officers with some gadgets to monitor everybody, to tape those who will be abusing and inciting people. We will also deploy some small cameras that cannot be seen to capture those propagating hate speech and incitement," he said.The Interior CS told National Assembly Committee on National Security and Administration chaired by Tiaty MP Asman Kamama that incitement poses a serious problem of tearing the country apart during campaigns and after the polls.Kamama demanded to measures the ministry has put in place to curb misuse of guns by politicians and castigating hate speech."Cases of misusing guns has been rampant across the country from Homa Bay, Mombasa, Nairobi, Kiambu, Embu, Kakamega, Meru to Murang'a. We have seen politicians including lawmakers fight with their rivals in public and guns drawn. Such incidents are very serious and should be looked into as we approach the elections," Kamama said.Homa Bay MP Peter Kaluma is facing assault charge after scuffling with his rival Washington Ogaga, a businessman, in November last year during a fundraiser at Homa Bay Stadium.Kaluma, however, denied the charge on December 1 before Senior Resident Magistrate Paul Mayoya and released on a Sh20,000 cash bail or Sh60,000 bond.The case will be heard between November 23 and 24 this year.Several MPs including Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria, Kimani Ngunjiri (Bahati), Ferdinand Waititu (Kabete), Timothy Bosire (Kitutu Masaba), Junet Mohamed (Suna East) and Machakos Senator Johnstone Muthama are facing charges of incitement. The National Cohesion and Integration Commission chaired by Francis ole Kaparo is investigating incitement claims against National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale (Garissa Town). Duale is linked to an incitement audio recording asking youths ensure the Kamba community does not register as voters in his constituency and vote in forthcoming polls. "Kenyans are brothers and sisters and majority of them don't want peace to be broken, people don't want instability. We have people, a few goons especially from your (MPs) opponents participating in rallies and normally try to disrupt," Nkaissery said."We are going to monitor, we are going to do civic education and we have already directed chiefs and their assistants, county commissioners and their deputies in every county to know the most likely volatile areas to address the issue of insecurity," he added.NCIC has also issued a stern warning against any politician caught propagating hate speech to split the country along ethnic lines and cause clashed during the this election year.. Nkaissery told the Kamama led committee that the ministry will compile a report on security measures undertaken to curb political instability caused by incitement for interrogation and tabled in the House. "This committee should sent this message to Kenyans from the floor of the House because we want this country to be secure. We will brief you so that you impart this message to Kenyans," he said.
