Opposition leaders have failed to explain how billions of shillings released to counties allied to them since 2013 have been used, the DP has said.William Ruto said this at the start of his five-day Coast tour on Friday, adding the Opposition has lied to residents about service by the national government.Ruto said the fact is that counties in the region have been receiving the billions for service to the people. He noted that the constitution is very clear on the roles of national and county governments.&ldquo;Does it mean it was not the right of the Coastal people to be served by governments when Opposition leaders Raila Odinga and Kalonzo Musyoka served as Prime Minister and Vice President respectively? Is it only during the Jubilee's rule that people here have a right to be served?" he asked.&ldquo;It is time you ignored the Opposition&rsquo;s lies and propaganda about development projects initiated by Jubilee in this region. They should tell us what they did for you when they served in government for more than 30 years instead of criticising our development projects."Read: Opposition leaders told to speak out on graft in &lsquo;Cord zonesThe Deputy President reiterated that the leaders have achieved nothing despite once serving as Prime Minister, Vice President and ministers.Ruto also repeated that the Opposition has no development agenda for the country but that the national government has done its part.He said leaders opposed to the government have not questioned misuse and diversion of funds from counties they "control"."It is as if the billions we send to counties should not be used to serve the people. All they keep complaining about is that the national government must do everything. What of the county governments?" he posed.&ldquo;Our development track record for this region speaks for itself. We are tarmacking 250-kilomtere of roads in this county, connected 102,000 residents to power up from 48,000 in 2013, upgraded two referral hospital, started Ronald Ngala Utalii College, solving land problems among other projects."[AUDIO] Cord confused over IEBC, cannot lead Kenya - RutoRead: Opposition clueless, no longer worthy opponent, Ruto says at Jubilee meetingRuto said Raila and his team were yet to come to terms with the fact that politics of propaganda and tribalism cannot help unite and develop Kenya."You cannot do the same thing over and over again and expect different results," he said.The DP asked the people to reject the Opposition as they have no capacity and the willingness to solve the challenges the region is facing.He told youths to take the lead by registering in large numbers as voters so as to participate in electing progressive leaders who are committed to addressing their challenges.Ruto addressed a leaders' meeting and a public rally at Watamu grounds, Kilifi county, during voter registration campaigns. He also addressed public rallies in Gede, Tezo, Kilifi, Vipingo, Kikambala and Mtwapa grounds.The DP was with leaders including MPs Gideon Mungaro (Kilifi North), Mustapha Iddi (Kilifi South), Zeinab Chidzuga (Kwale woman representative), Emma Mbura (Nominated), Harry Kombe (Magarini) and Peter Shehe (Ganze).Mung'aro said Coas residents will not be misled into supporting Opposition leaders, whom he said have failed to solve their problems.He said Kilifi county was among those that receive billions of shillings every year but claim misuse of resources by those in charge of the county.&ldquo;It is time we registered in large numbers and support Jubilee in the August 8 election because it has the interest of Coastal people at heart,&rdquo; he said.The leaders accused the Opposition of criticising Jubilee projects in the region yet they have nothing to compare them with.Read: Raila in a fix over audit of Cord counties, Governors deny financing his campaignsAlso read: Ababu hits at Cord for 'defending corruption' in counties
