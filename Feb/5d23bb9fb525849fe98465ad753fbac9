Deputy President William Ruto&rsquo;s one week voter mobilisation campaign in the North Rift is yet to yield a positive impact in having a high turnout of residents.Ruto&rsquo;s Uasin Gishu home county is performing below expectation in the registration. Only 37,050 new voters were registered in the first two weeks, against a target of 200,000.Governor Jackson Mandago and Jubilee aspirants have said they will meet the target before the last day of registration &ndash; February 14.&ldquo;We are on the ground and within the remaining days, more people will come out to register,&rdquo; he said. Sources say Ruto and the Jubilee leaders are worried that the low turnout is causing jitters within the ruling coalition. The DP met chiefs and village elders to urge them to help mobilise residents, but the impact of the meeting is yet to be seen. IEBC coordinator Bilha Kiptugen says they are targeting more than 700,000 new voters in the six counties.In the first two weeks Elgeyo Marakwet registered 12,896, Nandi had 26,381, Trans Nzoia 28,758, West Pokot 16, 326 and Turkana 15,326. The figures indicate less than 40 per cent of the target.Top civil servants have also been deployed by Jubilee to help mobilise residents to register as voters.
