Wajir Governor Ahmed Abdullahi yesterday winded up his three-day tour of the county with a call for peaceful co-existence among communities in the county.&ldquo;Especially in the face of the upcoming general election on August 8, residents should reject leaders who perpetuate chaos and clan conflicts to ascend to leadership positions,&rdquo; he said.In August last year, five people were killed and several others injured in Wajir North in inter-clan clashes.Wajir North MP Ibrahim Saney at the time threatened to lead residents in seeking refuge in Ethiopia if the national government failed to end the clashes.In November last year, armed men from Eldas and Wajir North clashed over a border dispute, which locals claimed was instigated by politicians.During his three-day tour, Abdullahi initiated several county projects.Among the projects is the Buna box culvert to help in drainage and prevent the town from being cut off during the rainy season.On Wednesday in Bute, Abdullahi told residents, &ldquo;My sincere gratitude and appreciation for the warm reception and unwavering support. I want to thank the locals for their support and vow to continue working with the community leaders in a bid to promote good governance.&rdquo;Speaking to the press in Wajir town yesterday, he said he met local leaders and residents to discuss the implemented projects and other priority projects they need.
