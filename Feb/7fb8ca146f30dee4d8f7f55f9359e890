Politics and corruption have frustrated the Nairobi government&rsquo;s efforts to remove hawkers from the city centre, Trade executive Anne Othoro has said.&ldquo;We will not lose the war. We will fight until the city is cleared,&rdquo; she told journalists at City Hall on Tuesday.Politicians blamedShe said she receives threats from politicians whenever the county launches a crackdown to clear the traders from the streets.&ldquo;Some of them even pay fines for the hawkers when they are charged and the following day they are on the streets,&rdquo; Othoro said.She also blamed corrupt inspectorate officers, whom she said have been receiving kickbacks to protect the hawkers and their wares.County, shops lose cashAbout 12,000 hawkers operate on city streets every day. They do not pay for any licence, denying the county more than Sh200 million revenue annually.The outlawed hawkers had early this month swarmed back into the CBD, selling their wares, including prohibited cooked food.They trade in the presence of city askaris who are supposed to kick them out of the streets.The traders have occupied streets, backstreets and pavements, cutting off access to licensed shops and stalls.Moi Avenue, Tom Mboya Street, Ronald Ngala Street, River Road, a footbridge in Ngara and areas around Tuskys Beba Beba and the National Archives have become marketplaces.The areas are congested, dirty, noisy and unsafe.&ldquo;These people occupy everywhere. They do not pay for any licence. They occupy parking spaces and therefore motorists cannot park their vehicles,&rdquo; Othoro said.They sell toys, second-hand clothes, cosmetics, shoes, fruits and other fresh produce.Leave stalls for &lsquo;free market&rsquo;Othoro said most of the hawkers have designated stalls in the 43 markets in the city, but have opted for the CBD because of the &ldquo;ready and free market.&rdquo;The county, she said, has spent more than Sh2 billion in four years expanding and repairing 33 markets to accommodate the hawkers, but they are still on the streets.Othoro said she has formed a department, Micro and Small Enterprises, to work with the inspectorate officers to bring sanity to the CBD.Last year, hawkers were removed from the CBD following an outcry by businesses and the public. They had taken control of the area and erected tents.They claimed they had genuine licences and sued the county.The county said the licences were issued fraudulently online and cancelled them.
