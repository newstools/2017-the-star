Former Hong Kong leader Donald Tsang has been sentenced to 20 months in prison for misconduct.Tsang led Hong Kong from 2005 to 2012 and was the most senior official in the territory ever to stand trial for corruption.He was found guilty last week of misconduct in public office, in a case related to a luxury flat in China.The case has worried a territory that prides itself on its relatively clean reputation.In sentencing, Judge Andrew Chan said: "Never in my judicial career have I seen a man fall from so high."Tsang was cleared of a second count of misconduct, while the jury failed to reach a verdict on a third charge of accepting an advantage.
