A High Court has upheld a decision to close all Bridge International Academies in Busia for failing to meet education standards.Justice Korir on Friday dismissed a complaint from the school after it sought to contest the decision by the Busia County education board.Korir directed the board to effect its decision in April, which comes shortly after Uganda directed that all Bridge schools be closed.This is to allow the county to secure slots for the affected children at a public school of their choice at the end of the current term.The judge said the order follows an inspection report which recommended the closure of ten out of the 12 schools in the county."The county has 45 days from the date of the judgment to show evidence that another school has been found for the children," he said. The county education board, in November 2014, had decided to close Bridge schools in Busia for non-compliance.In their recommendations, the board said the schools had failed to employ trained and registered teachers.They were also put on the spot for lacking managers, appropriate facilities, as well as an environmental impact assessment.Following the board's decision, Bridge International Academies, filed a suit against the team in March 2016.The school argued that the education board did not follow the adequate process in reaching its closure decision.Read: Bridge International schools in Busia to be closed downAlso read: Sossion wants Matiang&rsquo;i to close Bridge academiesMore on this: Parents, teachers want Sossion onslaught on Bridge schools stopped
