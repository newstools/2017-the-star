The Wiper party has created a special panel that will strike a deal on who between Nyali MP Hezron Awiti and Senator Hassan Omar will run for Mombasa governor.The Wiper panel members are said to be closely guarded to avoid external compromise.Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka will arbitrate.Incumbent Hassan Joho, who was elected on the ODM ticket, has indicated that he will defend his seat, while Jubilee is fronting businessman Suleiman Shahbal. Analysts are divided on the impact the coalition union will have, especially for Joho. Wiper and ODM are both parties in Cord, which are presently transiting to NASA. Wiper has maintained it will front its own candidate, complicating politics for NASA in Mombasa.Professor Rocha Chimera of Pwani University said Joho will be forced to put up a strong fight to repulse a union between Awiti and Hassan.He said upcountry votes, estimated to be more than 50 per cent of the 590,525 registered voters, will be a major factor if Awiti, a Luo, becomes the candidate and Omar his running mate.&ldquo;He should not be underestimated. Remember in 2013 he fought for Nyali MP against native John Mcharo and floored him,&rdquo; Chimera said.Analyst Mwarombo Mkanju said that on the other hand, if Omar becomes the governor candidate the team will have a Coastal outlook.&ldquo;This will prevent Joho from using the &lsquo;watu wa bara&rsquo; [non-natives] tag to drive his agenda,&rdquo; he said.Chimera said the two advantages, irrespective of who leads Wiper team, will steam up their quest to dethrone Joho.However, the foundation set by the incumbent will make it difficult to be shaken.Already the ODM governor has lost Deputy Governor Hazel Katana, a Mijikenda, to Jubilee.Mkanju said Joho will have to ensure balance in his choice for deputy.The Mijikenda are the largest single voting bloc in Mombasa, so his running should come from the community.By picking a non-Muslim and mostly a woman, he will have added a lifeline to his political career.But the Jubilee Party Shahbal- Anania Mwaboza combination will divide the Mijikenda and Swahili-Arab votes. Mwaboza is a Mijikenda. However, there is a religious imbalance in the camp.Wiper wants to have a combined force similar to that of JP.Jubilee will not hold primaries for the Mombasa governor position. Deputy President William Ruto announced that Shahbal and Mwaboza will team up. Announcement on whether Wiper's Awiti and Omar will join hands will probably come at the weekend due to strict deadlines.Wiper is avoiding a situation where the two will have to face off in primaries.&ldquo;You know a nomination will mean three things: win, lose or probably a fallout. The third is what we are avoiding at all costs,&rdquo; an insider said.Chimera said that an Awiti-Omar combination will augur well for Mombasa voters.The team will represent Islam and Christianity and the natives and upcountry community, he said.To solidify the Kamba votes, estimated to be second highest single vote bloc after the Mijikenda, the Kalonzo factor will come to play.If a deal is not struck, these advantages will slip away and the two will have to rush to pick running mates who will have similar appeals.One, who will decide to go as an independent, will have up to May 4, to submit his name and that of his deputy. For one who will cling to any party, he will have until April 12.Just as the Omar-Awiti team, Shahbal&rsquo;s lacks gender balance.The panel is yet to hold its first meeting, though it is slated for this week.There is intense backroom lobbying from supporters from both sides.&ldquo;The first meeting will set the pace of negotiations. It will determine whether the succeeding gatherings will be stormy, tempestuous or even calm and fruitful,&rdquo; a source told the Star.He said the meetings will be held in Nairobi.Both Awiti and Omar will attend some of the gatherings.Kalonzo last week promised to soon name a Wiper candidate for Mombasa governor.His announcement disrupt plans by Cord-Nasa to have a joint nomination in Mombasa and other battle grounds.Anyone who will bolt out will carry numbers with him and this will significantly eat into Wiper&rsquo;s vote bloc in Mombasa.Awiti is the Wiper national treasurer, while Omar is the secretary general.
