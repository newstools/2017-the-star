Health CS Cleopas Mailu has said he will appeal a ruling that jailed doctors union officials for one month over contempt of court.Trial judge Hellen Wasilwa effected the month long sentence on Monday after doctors refused to end their strike that began on December 5 last year and has left at least 20 people dead.[VIDEO] Doctors' union officials jailed one month for contempt of court"I will&nbsp;plead with Appeal Court to free the jailed officials of doctors' union to allow talks continue. The ministry&nbsp;is willing to continue negotiating," Mailu told the Health Senate Committee on Tuesday.Th CS said jailing the doctors was unfortunate but noted that the talks must be done in accordance to the law."It has never been the intention of the&nbsp;government&nbsp;for the doctors' strike to last this long.&nbsp;The union should have softened its position to ensure Kenyans get services," he said."My prayer is that they are released from prison and within two or so days we can strike a deal.&nbsp;We need to resolve this issue for doctors to go back to work," he added.Noting that the&nbsp;CBA is progressive, Mailu said with good will&nbsp;and focus, the documents will be negotiated."By end of tomorrow we will have come up with a framework on how to handle the crisis in counties," he said.When Mailu was asked&nbsp;why he and his PS were not present in the meetings where the document was signed, the CS said the&nbsp;ministry has been cooperating with the&nbsp;mediation teams fully.Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli said last week that there was internal wrangles in the Health ministry between Mailu and PS Nicholas Muraguri.Atwoli said their differences frustrated ongoing efforts to reach a return-to-work-deal with striking doctors."The ministry&nbsp;appointed four officers including the PS to be part of the mediation team," Mailu said.But he noted that Muraguri was nowhere to be seen at the meeting days later."On February 8, I received a memo from Muraguri where he nominated Francis Musyimi to represent him.Since then, Muraguri never attended any talks," Mailu told the committee.Mailu&nbsp;acknowledged&nbsp;that the&nbsp;services in public institutions were terrible but noted that most referral hospitals were functioning."In-patient services are extremely affected as they require specialists... out-patient is working.&nbsp;There is a crisis meeting of all the Health CECs to evaluate the situation," he said.He said the Health CECs will map out what needs to be done to improve services and this will be ready by tomorrow.Cord leader Raila Odinga&nbsp;said the month-long sentencing was&nbsp;"horrifying and disturbing" and that his lawyers would appeal judge Hellen Wasilwa's ruling.Read:&nbsp;Raila asks his lawyers to appeal 'disturbing' ruling that jailed doctorsDoctors and the government signed a Collective Bargaining Agreement in 2013 but it was declared illegal&nbsp;since it was not registered before the Industrial and Labour Court.They took it to court for registration last year, but justice Monica Mbaru ruled that their union had to negotiate a new one with the Health ministry, Salaries and Remuneration Commission and the counties.Doctors are demanding the fulfillment of the CBA that includes a&nbsp;300 per cent pay rise and better working conditions.They have also accused the government of failing to stock public hospitals with basic medicines and supplies of items such as gloves.Read:&nbsp;Oluga explains 'unfortunate' 65-day doctors' strike to Senate[VIDEO] Court suspends doctors' jail sentence, gives 5 days to call off strikeStriking doctors in Mombasa earlier said they will escalate the strike and ask those in the private sector to join them.KMPDU Coast branch secretary general Abi Mwachi&nbsp;added that a team had already been identified to rally the public to support their course.More on this:&nbsp;You have put spark on petrol, striking doctors tell state after officials jailed
