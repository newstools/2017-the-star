Showdown is looming in Migori county assembly today when the couny assembly reconvenes from recess as Jubilee Party affiliated MCAs plan to eject their colleagues who defected to ODM.Those earmarked to be sent packing are Deputy Minority Leader George Omamba (North Kanyamkago), Minority Chief Whip Odoyo Odara (Kwa) and nominated MCA Helen Oyaro both from People Democratic Party.The three share the same party with governor Okoth Obado and are his close allies for his reelection bid.On Monday while addressing the press at a hotel in Migori town, the disgruntled MCA led by Charles Nyange (Isebania) and nominated members Agnes Musembi (TIP) and Susan Mohabe (UDF) said they will push the three out.&ldquo;Tomorrow we will have a Kamukunji to elect our members as Jubilee party and edge out the three who have left us for ODM,&rdquo; Nyange said.Nyange claimed that they have been tolerating the three PDP members for long as they had promised &ldquo;to give us information from opposition to improve our ranks in Migori county which is not forthcoming.&rdquo;Mohabe said the assembly will be informed joined by Jubilee MCAs who number about 10 out of 63 members of the outcome before business of the house commence.&ldquo;Jubilee is not represented in speakers panel, assembly service board, house business committees and other important committee as these three members have refused to tow the Jubilee line,&rdquo; Mohabe said.The two said the three members have defected to ODM by paying nomination fee leaving their PDP party which folded up to Jubilee Party.But speaking to the Star over the phone on Omamba said the threats were null and void as &ldquo;assembly positions are never held through the party, but members elections.&rdquo;&ldquo;I defected back to ODM, and if they think I am holding the position for president Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto then so be it,&rdquo; Omamba said.Omamba said he has never held and brief for Jubilee Party in the assembly saying he was ready to face the faction in the house.&ldquo;The only attack is the belief that the minority posts have been held by our Kuria brothers, and we should make way as Luos. That is just a myth,&rdquo; Omamba said.
