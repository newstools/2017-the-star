Murang&rsquo;a county academic standards have fallen and education stakeholders need to team up to improve them, the Teachers Service Commission has said.CEO Nancy Macharia said, &ldquo;Let us work together for the good of our children.&rdquo;She spoke on Saturday at Kigumo Bendera grounds, Murang&rsquo;a, during the Kigumo Education Day.Macharia said the county recorded an overall decline from a mean score of 5.2 to 3.9 in last year&rsquo;s KCSE exam.The entire county had only one &lsquo;A&rsquo; scored by Juliet Akinyi Juma from Mugoiri Girls High School. Some 206 students got A- out of the 23,363 students who sat for the exam.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m aware that many people have attributed the drop to the &lsquo;KNEC effect&rsquo; and have gone ahead to argue that most schools across the country were affected. The county needs to focus more on quality grades,&rdquo; Macharia said.&ldquo;Only 16 per cent of the students who sat for the KCSE obtained grade C to qualify for admission to universities. The performance is wanting and all stakeholders must focus on this to produce better grades.&rdquo;Macharia, however, praised Kigumo schools for posting better results in last year&rsquo;s examinations.Kigumo MP Jamleck Kamau attributed academic excellence in the constituency to combined efforts among teachers, parents and the students.&ldquo;In 2007, Kigumo was trailing all constituencies in Murang&rsquo;a South district, but we have worked together through the years and reclaimed our leading position in the entire county,&rdquo; he said.Kamau said the CDF has also played a central role in improving grades by sponsoring bright and needy students.During the Education Day, the MP disbursed Sh23 million bursary funds to university, colleges and secondary school students.Other leaders at the function were Murang&rsquo;a Senator Kembi Gitura, woman representative Sabina Chege, Deputy Governor Gakure Monyo and Kigumo deputy county commissioner Moses Mbaluku.
