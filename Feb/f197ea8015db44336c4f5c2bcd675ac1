The Kenya Wildlife Service Lamu has warned of massive wildlife deaths resulting from drinking of saline ocean water in Lamu.County senior warden Jacob Orale said several hippos and buffaloes have died after drinking salty water in the Indian Ocean.Speaking in his office on Thursday, he said ocean water is not safe for wildlife. Orale said more deaths are being reported in Kwasasi, Basuba, Kililana and Mashunduani.&ldquo;We are worried that more animals will perish because the only water available now is highly saline,&rdquo; he said.Orale said most animals are now fleeing to human territories and habitats because of lack of water and they could be attacked and killed by residents.&ldquo;Last week, a hippo entered a house after sniffing water there. When we were called we had no option but to shoot it down in order to save the home owners,&rdquo; he said.Orale appealed to the government and well-wishers to join hands with KWS and put up dams and water pans for wildlife.
