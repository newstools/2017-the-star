The government is on the spot for attempting to interfere with the National Police Service Commission by sneaking illegal clauses into an Act passed by parliamentNPSC chairman Johnstone Kavuludi yesterday dismissed changes to the National Police Service Act seeking to remove the civilian employees such as accountants and engineers from being members of the Commission, among other set of contentious amendments.The state sneaked the controversial changes for passing in the House through a Miscellaneous Amendment Bill 2016, Kavuludi maintains the Commission, the Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet and his two deputies had never met to discuss any changes to the Act."These amendments caught us by surprise because we were not aware where these amendments arose from. At no time did NPSC, the IG na d his deputies sat to agree on proposed amendments. We only learned of them when the House began debating and it was reported in media," Kavuludi told National Assembly Committee on National Security and Administration.Majority Leader Aden Duale tabled the controversial amendments in the House.He maintained that both the NPSC and National Police Service Acts recognize civilian staff as members of the Service, equally provided with terms and conditions of service, procedure of recruitment and disciplinary measures like their counterpart uniformed police staff."The NPSC (Recruitment and Appointment) Regulations,2015 provides that the National Police Service Commission and the National Police Service shall maintain job descriptions and standard job specifications for all civilian and uniformed police as approved by the Commission," Kavuludi said.He said,"The proposed amendment should be shelved since it is contradictory and may bring about unnecessary confusion on the Service membership."The committee presided over by vice chairman Alois Lentoimaga (Samburu North) was also told that other amendments including one allowing the appointment of junior police officers as County Commanders poses a serious threat to proper functioning of the Police Service."If this is not corrected may be susceptible to abuse and may bring about the disregard of the command structure," Kavuludi warned.Nakuru Town East MP David Gikaria concurred with NPSC on grounds the state had "mischief" to sneak the amendments in the Miscellaneous Bills for MPs to pass them without knowing their implications."We should be keen on these Miscellaneous laws brought in the House because the government uses them to sneak in illegal legislation. These laws might have come from the Attorney General," Gikaria said.The committee resolved to talk to Duale to withdraw the amendments until consultations are made as required by the Constitution.
