THE Government notes the court&rsquo;s direction that the Kenya National Commission of Human Rights and the Law Society of Kenya mediate negotiations between the parties.As has been the case throughout this process, the Government will continue to support negotiations in every way possible.To this end, the Ministry of Labour, which has historically been charged with stepping in, as a broker, during contentious negotiations between employers and employees, will be on hand to lend its experience to each and every party.The officials of the Ministry of Health will be also engaged throughout the process, with the aim of adding value and support to driving the negotiations towards a speedy resolution and return to work.As per the direction of the Court of Appeal, we look forward to a viable way forward being agreed upon and presented to the Kenyan people on February 23, 2017.The Government believes that the pending issues in the ongoing negotiations, which centre on matters of remuneration and compensation, can be resolved in this timeframe.The Government takes this opportunity to thank the clinical officers, nurses and other medical personnel who are still working hard to provide public healthcare throughout the country.We have noted with dismay the painful costs that Kenyans, particularly those of modest means, have borne since the the strike commenced on December 5 last year.The Ministry of Health has observed, nationally, that the behaviour of Kenyans seeking medical care has changed, with many now not going to clinics and dispensaries in the belief that there is no care available. Yet we have nurses and clinical officers on duty.Kenyan lives have been used as bargaining chips: The suffering and even death of men, women and children has become a means to apply pressure at the negotiating table.This is wrong, cruel, cynical and it does not speak of the hard work, sacrifice and nobility that those who pursued medicine as a profession embraced at the outset of their careers.Doctors are a special category of public servants alongside the security services. Their jobs are to directly protect the lives of Kenyans.Failure on their part, or the refusal to work, leads to lost lives, destroyed families and a weaker nation.At the end of the day, we should all be on the side of the Kenyans who need access to improved healthcare.
