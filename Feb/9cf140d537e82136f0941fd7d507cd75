Nairobi assembly speaker Alex ole Magelo yesterday denied he will resign. &ldquo;I am still the speaker and I have a lot of work to do. Our schedule has a lot to be achieved and I will only cease being the speaker at midnight on August 7,&rdquo; he said. Several junior officers have been bragging at City Hall that they will clinch the seat once he resigns. &ldquo;I can tell you I will be the next speaker. Wait and see once Mzee Magelo quits,&rdquo; one employee said. In 2013, Magelo ran for Kajiado South MP but lost to Moses Sakuda of TNA.
