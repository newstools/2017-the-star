The Kenya National Examinations Council has tried to allay fearst it may not register the required number of candidates for this year&rsquo;s KCPE and KCSE exams. Knec acting CEO Mercy Karogo said the numbers have started picking up ahead of the February 28 deadline. &ldquo;We are optimistic that by Tuesday next week, we will have the right numbers,&rdquo; she told the Star on the phone. Karogo said 677,121 KCPE exam candidates had registered by yesterday morning, against a target of slightly more than one million. She said of a target of slightly more than 600,000 KCSE candidates, 477,948 have been registered. On Saturday, Basic Education PS Belio Kipsang expressed concern that the council might fail to hit the target due to low registration. He said about 350,000 KCPE candidates had registered by last Wednesday, while the registered KCSE candidates were less than 100,000. Kipsang urged head teachers to speed up the registration, an appeal that was repeated by Karogo.
