After years of getting low returns for their crop, more than 800 sugar cane farmers in East Ugenya have switched to sorghum. They said sorghum is drought-resistant and economically viable. Farmer Maurice Ochieng yesterday said sorghum is readily consumable, as it is easy to turn it into flour. He said for 20 years he would only get Sh25,000 per acre of sugar cane after harvest every two-and-half years. Sorghum surpasses that with just a season&rsquo;s harvest, Ochieng said. &ldquo;We can now comfortably pay secondary school fees for our children, unlike in the past when proceeds from sugar cane were unpredictable,&rdquo; he&rsquo; said. Farmer Alice Ajinja (pictured) said they negotiate prices for their produce, unlike sugar cane farming whose prices are dictated by the millers. The farmers switched to sorghum in an initiative sponsored by International Crops Research Institute for Semi Arid Tropics.
