US First Lady Melania Trump headed down to the nation's capital on Wednesday, where she joined her husband in welcoming Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara to the White House.It marked the first official appearance Melania has made since her husband was sworn into office almost one month ago on January 20, with the 46-year-old mother choosing to stay in New York City with her son Barron rather than join President Trump in the White House. The First Lady stood alongside her husband outside the South Portico of the White House to welcome the Netanyahus at noon.Melania greeted her guests with a kiss and the group exchanged pleasantries while posing for some photos before going inside for the President and Prime Minister's news conference.Once inside, Melania sat next to Ivanka, who attended the early afternoon event with her husband, Jared Kushner. The First Lady and her stepdaughter did not appear to socialize much at the event and barely spoke to one another, though Ivanka did arrive for the news conference just before it got underway.And Ivanka and her husband were left behind after the conference as Sara and Melania spent the afternoon together at the African American History.Melania's smiling appearance at the White House on Wednesday came on the same day a story emerged claiming she was secretly 'miserable' in her new role as First Lady and had spent the past month rarely leaving her apartment in Trump Tower.US Weekly spoke with multiple sources close to Melania who shared details about her life over the past month, and how she is reacting to the big changes in her world. 'This life wasn&rsquo;t her dream. It was Donald&rsquo;s,' said her friend, stylist Phillip Bloch.'Truthfully, it's a lot to cope with.'And another source claims that she does not want to leave her apartment for anything or anyone, choosing to have the Secret Service take Barron to school and pick him up at the end of the day.That however could have more to do with the outcry it would cause in New York City if she did decide to make that trip, as it would require a full motorcade and cause road closures all the way from Trump Tower in midtown to Barron's school across town. Multiple sources also shoot down claims that she is unhappy and say she is 'embracing the role and responsibilities of first lady.'
