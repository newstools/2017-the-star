Governor Salim Mvurya faces stiff competition from five aspirants who have declared their interest in the seat, especially after his defection to the Jubilee Party. Mvurya has had it rough in the past four years.The governor race is expected to be a battle between opposition ODM/NASA and the Jubilee Party in a region perceived to be an opposition stronghold.Those who have announced their bid to unseat Mvurya are speaker Sammy Ruwa, Nicholas Zani, Chirau Mwakwere, who defected from Jubilee at the weekend, Gereza Dena and Mwachai Mwarapayo, all of ODM.In 2013, Mvurya run against Dena, Simeon Mkallah, Kassim Riga, Chidzao Nyanje and Mwarapayo and still won with a big margin.THE ISSUESMinerals and land issues remain at the centre of Mvurya&rsquo;s criticism. His critics claim his defection to Jubilee is a scheme to grab and exploit land and minerals with &lsquo;outsiders&rsquo;, propaganda he has denied in public rallies across the county.In his recent visit to the county early this month, President Uhuru Kenyatta said,&rdquo; Those claiming Governor Mvurya joined Jubilee to grab land in Kwale should know we have no interest in anyone&rsquo;s land. Everyone has the right to live anywhere and own land. If you sell your land it is okay.&rdquo;President Uhuru declared the Makonde, who have lived in Kwale for over 60 years, the 43rd tribe of Kenya and issued them with ID cards. The registration of 2,950 Makondes was seen as a ploy to seek their support in his reelection.MVURYA&rsquo;S ACHIEVEMENTSMvurya has maintained his administration has done everything possible to solve issues such as land, education, food insecurity, health, trade and tourism, which had not been fixed since Independence.He accuses his opponents of spreading rumours that residents will be evicted from their land because mining firms have interests in the mineral-rich areas.In agriculture, farmers have received tractors, seeds and fertiliser, free of charge, to subsidise their farming and increase food production.&ldquo;My administration is determined to ensure that 71 per cent of our people living in poverty benefit from the resources we receive from the national government. We want to ensure equal distribution of these resources,&rdquo; Mvurya said.In education, the county now has 2,310 students in national schools, 502 in universities and 68 others studying in India and graduating this year, all sponsored under the county school bursary programme.&ldquo;My administration has also focussed on early childhood development and education, particularly in infrastructure, instruction materials, nutrition and hygiene and outdoor activities equipment,&rdquo; Mvurya said.Some 160 fully equipped ECDE centres have been built and 450 teachers employed.This, he said, has seen increased enrollment from 63,683 in 2013 to 75,029 last year. The governor says it&rsquo;s the first time in history that ECDE teachers have pay slips.Education executive Mangale Chiforomodo says pupils from 800 ECDE centres have benefitted from a porridge feeding programme sponsored by the county.&ldquo;The new EDCE centres have instruction materials, art, play equipment, water tanks, tables and chairs,&rdquo; he added.By so doing, Mangale said they are setting a good foundation for children joining primary schools, which will eventually transition to those who will join secondary school.&ldquo;The majority of these pupils were either studying under trees,or in mud walled or makuti-thatched dilapidated classrooms. They sat on stones or on the floor. We now have good classrooms, conducive for learning and with enough learning materials,&rdquo; Mangale said.Mvurya has attributed his development record to the support from the Jubilee administration, saying he is happy to continue working with it for the benefit of the people.In health, the governor says 28 new maternity wings have been built. Health executive Athaman Chiguzo adds they have employed 460 health workers since 2013, and upgraded subcounty and county hospitals in the area.&ldquo;Msambweni County Referral Hospital has been upgraded. It now has a renal unit, an ICU and state-of-the-art equipment worth Sh250 million delivered by the national government,&rdquo; Chiguzo said.He said in Kinango Subcounty Hospital, the county has constructed an emergency unit and a drugs store.&ldquo;Lunga Lunga Health Centre was upgraded to a subcounty hospital level, with emergency unit. In Kwale Hospital, we have an emergency unit, X-ray block and a drugs store.&rdquo;The Mvurya administration has also helped fishermen with modern boats put up storage facilities for them and built a granary for maize farmers in Lunga Lunga.It is based on these achievements that Governor Mvurya hopes the locals will reelect him in August.CRITICISMBut critics have accused Mvurya of mismanaging and corrupting county funds and of tribalism in employment, claims he has denied. Allocation of more than Sh16 billion from the National Treasury since 2013 has been at the centre of criticism by opponents.Speaker Ruwa says development in Kwale is not a one-man-show, as Mvurya has always said, because the assembly approves all budgets for implementation.&ldquo;If corruption in his government is still rampant, it is wrong for him to take credit on projects, which are implemented jointly by the assembly and the executive,&rdquo; Ruwa said.The speaker, who has a degree in business and law, says he is the best person to unseat the governor, whose only qualification is in agriculture.&ldquo;There are a lot of things that have gone wrong, and I feel I am the only person who can take this county to another level in terms of development,&rdquo; the speaker said.Zani says Mvurya joined Jubilee for his own interests and not for the people of Kwale.Mwakwere&rsquo;s campaign team describes Mvurya&rsquo;s leadership as a failed one and says it should be changed in August. Mwakwere recently resigned as Kenya&rsquo;s High Commissioner to Tanzania.Kwale is known for its minerals and tourism and is located on the South Coast, bordering Tanzania and Taita Taveta, Kilifi, and Mombasa counties.The majority of residents are the Digo and the Duruma from the Mijikenda, followed by minority groups the Akamba.Most residents in Kwale rely on farming for a living.The region, is among areas that were marginalised and experienced historical injustices before devolution started in 2013. It is rich in niobium minerals worth Sh5.4 trillion in the Mrima Hill, among other minerals such as titanium, which are already being extracted for commercial purposes.
