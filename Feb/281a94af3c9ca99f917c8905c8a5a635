A man in Mwingi seeks financial help to treat his son&rsquo;s strange skin disease. Kitau Kivite said yesterday was his longest day after his 25-year-old son, Savali, was rejected by a private hospital. They had travelled from Lundi, 40 kilometres away. He almost broke down while narrating his story to the Star.&ldquo;The duty nurse only prescribed some drugs and didn&rsquo;t want us to spend more time there. She said she was scared too,&rdquo; Kivite said. He said the nurse told him the disease can only be treated by specialists at Kenyatta National Hospital.&ldquo;The disease started one week ago and we thought it was a poisonous insect that had bitten him, but the condition worsened. My son has bad wounds that bleed continuously after they burst. I am not even sure if he has any blood in his body at the moment,&rdquo; Kivite said.He said the wounds started on the hands and spread to all parts of the body. Kivite said Savali was born with abnormalities and has never gone to school. &ldquo;He sometimes speaks but most of the time he is silent,&rdquo; he said.
