Kiambu Governor William Kabogo has urged county clerics to pray for him to retain the county&rsquo;s top seat even if they will not vote for him.He spoke on Friday at the ACK Church in Kahawa Sukari at a clerics meeting convened by area MP Esther Gathogo.Kabogo told the clerics he will not seek votes in churches but will seek God&rsquo;s intervention in his reelection bid.&ldquo;You will weigh the capacities of all aspirants and if you won&rsquo;t deem it fit to vote for me, just pray for me because I believe prayers will work for me,&rdquo; he said.Kabogo accused his political rivals of taking politics to churches and funerals. He said such people should be barred from misusing the pulpit for their political gains.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my call to all clerics not to allow any politician to use the pulpit to hurl insults at their rivals or discredit their performance. Giving them space will be abetting crime. Politicians should respect places of worship and only seek votes in other meetings,&rdquo; Kabogo said.The county boss will face Kabete MP Ferdinand Waititu, real estate magnate David Kariuki Ngari, James Nyoro and businesswoman Aquiline Njoki Gathendu in the governor contest.Kabogo said his rivals have been tarnishing his name in political meetings by discrediting his development projects. He termed their sentiments mere rhetoric.&ldquo;We are all in the race but only one of us will emerge a victor. It&rsquo;s Kiambu people who will decide who to lead them,&rdquo; Kabogo said.Gathogo urged clerics to pray for peace to prevail and urged all aspirants to be ambassadors of peace.She also urged striking medics to end the suffering of Kenyans by solving their standoff with the state through dialogue.&ldquo;We have witnessed massive loss of life in our country due to the doctors&rsquo; strike. I'm appealing to them to have mercy on the innocent souls facing death for being unattended to in the health centres and return to work,&rdquo; Gathogo said.
