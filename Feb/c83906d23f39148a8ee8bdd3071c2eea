Mombasa woman representative Mishi Mboko wants the incitement case against her closed, citing lack of evidence.Through her lawyer Siaya Senator James Orengo, Mboko said she has no case to answer. Orengo said there are no clear charges against Mboko. He yesterday told chief magistrate Julius Nang&rsquo;ea to get the &ldquo;clear meaning&rdquo; of the charge and render it defective. In June 2014, Mboko appeared before a Mombasa court to answer charges of incitement to violence. Mboko was accused of saying, &ldquo;Kenyans are going to bring a revolution to this country. Enough is enough, we are tired. The revolution is with the people and sovereignty is with the people. The revolution is with the people. People power! People power!&rdquo;She was also accused of promoting ethnic hatred. She denied the charges. Nang&rsquo;ea will rule on March 17.
