We depended on well-wishers. We don&rsquo;t sleep because she is in so much pain. I wish doctors would go back to work and help reduce her suffering," said Wanjiku."I was forced to take her back home but since she was suffering so much, I have been begging people for money. We have used the little amount we got to take her to hospitals including MP Shah and St Mulumba and local clinics for dressing."Wanjiku, who lives in Muthara area Juja subcounty, said it was torturous to see her daughter going through the pain.&ldquo;We require the amount for reconstructive surgery. We are poor and cannot raise it,&rdquo; she said.Donations can be sent via M-Pesa paybill account 572184, name 'Pauline Mugure Medical Funds', or to mobile phone number 0798 662804.
