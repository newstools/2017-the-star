The IEBC vice chairperson Consolata Nkatha yesterday said logistical problems and limited time to adequately prepare for the August election are the major limiting factors that undermine the commission&rsquo;s ability to register voters in the diaspora. &ldquo;We have tried all our best to include other countries, South Africa being one of them. But apparently, the logistics could not allow the commission to go beyond because only six months remain to the election,&rdquo; she said. Speaking at the Nchaure Primary School in Imenti North subcounty, Nkatha said the deadline for voter registration will not be extended beyond today.She said she has toured various registration centres and was impressed by the turnout. &ldquo;There is no need to extend the registration as the IEBC has got a big burden ahead of it &mdash; compiling the data, verification of the data and auditing. I urge people to register within the remaining days so the IEBC can have time to clean the register,&rdquo; Nkatha said. She said many Kenyans have been involved in mobilising others to register as voters and this has made the numbers go up. Nkatha expressed her optimism that the commission might meet the four million target.She said preparations are underway to register prisoners with ID cards and the excise will start on Feb 20-27.
