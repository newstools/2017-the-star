A section of youths in Bomachoge and South Mugirango on Wednesday disrupted Governor James Ongwae&rsquo;s voter registration campaigns. They said they were unhappy that Ongwae has not fulfilled some of his election pledges. When Ongwae stopped to address Kenyenya residents, the youths allied to Jubilee burnt two T-shirts branded with ODM logos. They carried placards bearing the words &ldquo;This area is a Senator Chris Obure&rsquo;s zone.&rdquo; The youths hurled one of the burning T-shirts at enforcement officer Osugo Nyakangi, causing minor head burns. Nyakangi was taken to a hospital in Kisii town, where he was treated and discharged. Ongwae told the youths not to be used by politicians to cause chaos. &ldquo;I am here with the entire team to urge you to register as voters,&rdquo; he said.
