Top flight football is set to return to the famed Sudi Stadium in Bungoma and the lush Kericho Green Stadium after the Kenyan Premier League Stadia Safety and Security Committee (SSSC) provisionally approved three other stadiums outside the traditional venues to host SportPesa Premier League matches in the 2017 season.The two venues now home to Nzoia United and Zoo Kericho respectively were given the green light alongside Narok Stadium in Narok County.The two venues, according to a statement posted on the KPL official portal, were all found conditionally fit to stage low or/and medium risk league matches. However, they require more improvements to become ideal venues for top flight action.&ldquo;SSSC established that Sudi has a good pitch but the changing rooms are sub-standard. The facility can only be used for very low risk matches.Work is ongoing at Kericho Green Stadium including the erection of the inner and outer perimeter and construction of temporary changing rooms while the playing surface needs to be worked on. Medium and low risk matches have been allowed on this venue,&rdquo; read the statement by the stadia safety body.The committee also revealed that Narok Stadium has received a major facelift with the construction of the main stand, new changing rooms, outer perimeter wall and parking among other amenities, and has been provisionally been approved to host both medium and low risk matches. Kenyan giants AFC Leopards have shown a keen interest of playing their home matches there with reports suggesting that Kasarani and Nyayo Stadium may be closed for renovation ahead of the world youth athletics championships and the African Nations Championship to be held in July and next year respectively.The safety committee said Bomet Stadium, which they also inspected is still under construction and work is projected to be completed in May and therefore a new inspection will be required then.Meanwhile, Kipchoge Keino Stadium has been closed for eight months and will thus not be available to the league while Muhoroni Stadium in Kisumu County has been allowed to hold only low risk matches. A full report of all stadiums eligible to host top flight club football matches will be released by SSSC later on.
