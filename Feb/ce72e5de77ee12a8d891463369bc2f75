South Africa has denied reports that its amended visa law and immigration regulations for passengers travelling with underage are targeting Kenyans. High Commissioner to Kenya Koleka Anita says an office has been opened to tackle immigration challenges that have arisen, but remains noncommittal on whether the law will be relaxed.Under the new legislation, children below 18 years are required to produce Unabridged Birth Certificate, in addition to their passport, when exiting and entering South African ports. The certificate provides details of their parents. Minors travelling with single parents will have to produce an affidavit in which the absentee parent gives consent for the child to travel, a court order granting full parental responsibilities, or legal guardianship of the child, or the death certificate for the deceased parent. Anita said the law is meant to curb human trafficking.The South African Department of Home Affairs says 30,000 minors are trafficked through South African borders every year, 50 per cent under the age of 14.South Africa's new regulation set visa processing fee at Sh4,200, and takes five days. South Africans can get a Kenyan visa for free. &ldquo;We have shortened the applications for students,&rdquo; Anita said, adding South Africa has reviewed 10, five and three-year visas for business people.The Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry Mombasa chairman James Mureu said they have made good progress on business matters.He said since the validity period for visas was extended, a three-year one has helped bolster trade between the two nations.In October, President Uhuru Kenyatta hosted his South African counterpart Jacob Zuma at State House, and the two agreed to further discuss requests to relax the rules for Kenyans visiting South Africa.Uhuru lobbied for free visa for Kenyans during his visit to South Africa.Foreign Affairs ministers for the two countries are said to be working on the visa issue.
