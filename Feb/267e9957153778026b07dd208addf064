The wailing of a sick and a frustrated man softed a judge to bring forward the hearing of his Sh150 million land case by seven months. Justice Samson Okong&rsquo;o empathised with the condition of Francis Muturi directed the case to be heard on March 30, instead of October 2.Muturi has sued businessmen Hitesh Morjaria and Vijay Morjaria.Although he is being represented by lawyer William Arusei, Muturi addressed the court himself. He said, &ldquo;My Lord, I do not know whether I will live up to October 2. I have a heart condition and nervous disorder. I urgently need more than Sh4 million to travel to India for specialised treatment as recommended by doctors at the Kenyatta National and Karen hospitals.&rdquo;Muturi said Hitesh and Vijay breached the sale agreement they signed on October 5, 2012 to purchase his land along Mombasa Road at Sh45 million.They were required to complete buying the land within 90 days upon payment of the downpayment of 10 per cent &ndash; Sh4.5million.&ldquo;I do not want to engage with them any further. It is four years now when they paid me 10 per cent of the sale amount then they disappeared. They have breached the sale agreement. They fraudulently transferred the title deed of my land into their names and started frustrating me.&rdquo;Muturi, who walks with crutches and has a neckbrace, told the judge that his land is now fetching more than Sh150 million. "But I cannot even sell it to them,&rdquo; he said.As he emotionally addressed the court members of the public begun to cry as they saw the difficulty he was in.&ldquo;See your client now, he wants me to intervene for him and he deserves,&rdquo; Justice Okong&rsquo;o told Arusei, who is the third advocate to come on record for plaintiffs Muturi and Kennedy Maranga.The two want the court to cancel the title deed issued to Hitesh and Vijay irregularly by the registrar of titles because they breached the sale agreement. Arusei told the judge he will fast track the case.
