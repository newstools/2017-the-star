Tension is high in several schools in Kwale County after the school heads shelved the District Secondary Schools Term One games due to lack of funds.Kinango, Msambweni and Lunga Lunga sub-counties, who were all set for games were informed of the cancellation at the last minute and ordered to go home for half term. Term One games features basketball, hockey, cross-country, rugby 15, heptathlon and decathlon.But Coast Secondary Schools Sports Association (CSSSA) chairman, Rodgers Siasa Mwafungo, who was away attending a Kenya Secondary Schools Sports Association (KSSSA) meeting in Embu, claimed education officers in the three sub-counties were courting trouble with the Ministry of Education and advised them to recall the students from half term and stage the games. &ldquo;The Education Ministry has already disbursed funds to schools and given clear instructions that Sh250 per child be submitted to the sub-counties for the activities. It therefore doesn&rsquo;t make sense that such simple instructions could not be followed,&rdquo; a tough-talking Mwafungo said.Similar sentiments were echoed by the KSSSA deputy secretary, Robert Mukhwana, who said it is unfortunate that some sub-counties had failed to follow the ministerial directives.&ldquo;The ministry has sent a circular clearly stating that head teachers deduct Sh500 from the money disbursed to the schools for free secondary school education and submit Sh250 to sub counties, Sh150 to counties and Sh100 to the regional body activities. These are directives that must be followed by all,&rdquo; Mukhwana said.Mwafungo appealed to the sub counties who failed to hold their activities to find ways of doing aso before March 8 when county games are held.&ldquo;Our sports calendar for this year has been squeezed to ensure all activities conclude by July first week. This leaves us with no time at all to postpone games,&rdquo; he said.Only Matuga sub county of Kwale successfully held their sub county games.
