Embattled Jamaican sprinter Nesta Carter has filed an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sports (CAS) after he was retroactively found guilty of doping at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, his lawyer said on Wednesday. Carter is awaiting a date to come before the CAS for his appeal, lawyer Stuart Stimpson told Reuters after confirming the appeal had been submitted to the Switzerland-based body within the 21-day deadline. "Yes, they were sent electronically today and the hard copies (sent by courier) will get there tomorrow, so they (documents) have been filed," Stimpson said. "We've paid our fees and we met our time line." Carter retroactively tested positive for the banned stimulant methylhexaneamine in 2008 and on Jan. 25 was stripped of his 4x100 gold medal along with team mates Usain Bolt, Asafa Powell, and Michael Frater. The filing of the appeal came four days after the 2013 world championship 100m bronze medallist made his competitive return by anchoring his MVP track Club's 4x100m team to second place at the Milo Western Relays in Montego, ending 17 months of inactivity. That came after clearance was given to him by the IAAF, the world track and field governing body.
