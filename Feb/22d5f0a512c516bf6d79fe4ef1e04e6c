Two people were shot dead and over 1, 000 fled their homes after suspected armed Pokot bandits attacked Arabal, Baringo South subcounty on Sunday.This followed the cold blood killing of Loyamorok MCA Kibet Cheretei and Tiaty parliamentary aspirant Pepee Kitambaa at Petro-Alfa Junction restaurant in Marigat town on Saturday morning.&ldquo;They killed two people and made away with over 300 heads of cattle and escaped to the Chesiririmion Hills in Tiaty subcounty,&rdquo; Arabal chief William Koech told the Star on the phone on Monday.Koech said the killing happened barely four days after Philemon Kemei, a teacher at Kapndasum Primary School in Baringo South was killed on Wednesday last week.He said attempts by the residents with the help of Kenya Police Reservists to repulse the over 200 bandits was futile because they were overwhelmed and because they were armed with AK-47 firearms.&ldquo;Security officers arrived at the scene later after the bandits had already disappeared. The search of the criminals is, however, still ongoing,&rdquo; he said.The chief said the serial attacks since Friday last week have displaced more than 1,000 people from Arabal, Sirata, Kapndasum and Kasiela villages. They have moved to the Kabal, Marigat and Mochongoi areas, which are relatively safer.Meanwhile, residents of Yatya, Chemoe, Loruk and Ng&rsquo;aratuko in Baringo North subcounty have reported that they have spotted the armed bandit,s who might be planning to attack them.&ldquo;We fear these herders might attack us again anytime now,&rdquo; Richard Chepchomei, a resident of Chemoe, said.Tension is still high in Marigat and Tiaty after hundreds of protestors stormed Marigat Police Station on Sunday demanding urgent government intervention to end the banditry killings in the county.&ldquo;After the shooting of the two politicians and now the killing of two people in Arabal we feel unsafe and we now appeal for an urgent government intervention.&rdquo; Marigat-based business man Joseph Rotich told the Star.Tiaty Member of Parliament (MP) Asman Kamama has distanced himself from the blame over the killings saying even himself was also a target with some six individuals marked for assassination by unknown assailants.&ldquo;My life is also at threat like my fallen brothers then how do I have engaged myself in the killing&rdquo; Kamama said on Saturday urging the police to move faster with investigations to bring to book the suspects behind the evil act. Baringo County Commissioner Peter Okwanyo has today(Moday) convened a peace meeting at Lake Bogoria Spar Hotel in Marigat involving 50 elders each from Tugen, Ilchamus and Tugen communities to discus way forward pertaining the runaway insecurity in the county.
