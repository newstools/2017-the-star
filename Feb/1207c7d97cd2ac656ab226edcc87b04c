Opposition chief Raila Odinga yesterday said the IEBC voter&rsquo;s register has been compromised.He said at Lavington Primary School, Nairobi, the database was manipulated so the cell that has ID numbers can take any numbers instead of the eight for national IDs or seven for a passport.Raila accused former IEBC employees of tampering with the software.&ldquo;Our investigation has confirmed that numbers that do not qualify as ID numbers have been used to register voters in parts of the country and that is responsible for what is being presented as high turnout in voter registration in those regions,&rdquo; he said.Raila said a random check shows 0 00 1 2 11 12 231 111 20 21 and 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 40 have been used as ID numbers to register Gitonga Wilson Kimathi, Kanja Julius Ngede, Kihinge Evans Kariuki, Kirinya Victoria Gatwiri, Mu Ko, Mugara Duncan, Muia Mbinya and Wanjiru Caroline Nduta.He said the system was manipulated so single digits such as the ones listed can be used to register foreigners or those without IDs.&ldquo;But it is also possible that the names popping up under the fake ID numbers may be non-existent. These could be virtual voters, non-existent human beings being included in the IEBC register to create room for ballot stuffing during elections,&rdquo; Raila said.He said the doctoring is being carried out in the homes of a senior government official and the office of a former Cabinet Secretary.&ldquo;The numbers above are only a drop in the ocean. The total number of people registered in the IEBC database using different combinations is estimated to be in the thousands,&rdquo; Raila said
