The Sabaot council yesterday endorsed Bungoma Deputy Governor Hilary Chongwony&rsquo;s second term.Chogonwony has been facing rebellion from the Sabaot leaders who have urged Governor Kenneth Lusaka to replace him. Former MP Fred Kapondi and former civic leader Rophas Sioyi have been piling pressure on Lusaka, threatening to withdraw their support, if he does not replace Chongwony.But yesterday, some of the elders said Chongowony has performed well and is loyal to Lusaka.The elders further urged the county and national governments to work with authorities from Uganda to curb the isolated cases of cattle rustling and insecurity.
