Thousands of Kwale residents have unwillingly transferred their votes from one ward to another in exchange for money during the drought. Most of them are paid as little as Sh200 by politicians who have taken advantage of the poverty and hunger. The Star has learnt that most of the transfers have been reported in Lunga Lunga. In Vanga ward, a politician has been blamed for transporting voters from the neighbouring wards. Some residents said they were ferried and lied to.
