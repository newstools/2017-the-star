The Unclaimed Financial Assets Authority has called upon beneficiaries to claim the resources it holds. In a statement yesterday, UFAA reported that the total global value of unclaimed assets received and credited to its Trust Fund account at the Central Bank of Kenya as at the end of December 2016 is Sh25.1 billion.The assets reported in a just-concluded compliance cycle range from unclaimed salaries and wages, royalties, unclaimed client moneys and loan credits to dormant account balances and matured insurance policies.Asset owners&rsquo; names and their last known addresses have been published on the Authority&rsquo;s website for online enquiries. UFAA said 2,160 claims totaling Sh83.5 million had been made and 31 per cent of them paid out.The billions are held without earning interest. If they were on deposit they would generate hundreds of millions of shillings annually, money that could be put to such good causes as being made available at ultra-low interest to entities such as HELB.
