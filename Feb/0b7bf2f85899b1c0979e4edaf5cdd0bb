Former Transport Permanent Secretary Dr. Cyrus Njiru has warned his opponents in race for Embu gubernatorial seat to warm up for a vicious battle for the seat.Speaking to the Star on phone Dr. Njiru on Saturday said his campaign will be based on a platform of change and uniting the various communities residing in Embu. He said that Embu residents were dissatisfied with the current leadership as it has failed to deliver development as they had promised during their last campaigns.Dr. Njiru added that his campaign will be based on how to tackle the pressing issues that have affected the residents of the county over the years."My campaign plus that of my team will be based on issues. Looking forward to your support in this journey," he told the residents on Saturday.He said his leadership style will be driven by the people whom he will always consult on how best they want their needs met."It is my electorates who will be telling me of their needs and together we prioritise with the available resources," he said.Dr. Njiru, who served the country during former President Mwai Kibaki&rsquo;s second term, said some people are already hating him following the "massive approval" of his candidature by a chunk of the region's voters."Some may hate me or my ambition to dream big but one thing is sure. I have been consistent in my zeal for a better Embu and the country at large," he noted.He said he is not scared of the entry of Kithinji Kiragu in the Party of national unity (PNU) adding that he is ready to face him off in the nominations.&lsquo;&rsquo;I was among the brains behind the Thika Superhighway, Lapsset project, Standard Gauge Railway, ports and airports expansions when i served as the PS, this is after President Kibaki poached me from African Development Bank,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said.
