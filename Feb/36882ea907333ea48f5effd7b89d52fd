A nine month old baby died on Monday night while her parents were injured in a fire incident in Nairobi&rsquo;s Mkuru slums.Several other children were rescued but property of an unknown value was destroyed.The fire that started at around 10pm gutted more than 40 structures leaving many homeless. Police are yet to know the cause of the fire that started from one of the houses.Elsewhere in Matopeni slums, 20 others structures were also burnt down. No one was injured during the accident.The two fire accidents occurred just hours after survivors of the 2011 Sinai slum fire that claimed at least 102 lives lost their fight for Sh25 billion compensation.The fire broke out after flammable oil leaked from a malfunctioning pipe at the Kenya Pipeline depot into the densely populated settlement.Those who were hospitalised for long periods after September 12 tragedy wanted the court to award them damages for loss of livelihood.Justice Edward Muriithi said on Monday that the court was sympathetic but that compensation was impossible since they did not file a proper suit.Muriithi said they would each have to prove their loss and establish liability for the order to be granted.Read; Hopes dashed as court declines to give Sinai fire survivors Sh25 billion
