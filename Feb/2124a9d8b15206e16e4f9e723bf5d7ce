Nyeri Senator Mutahi Kagwe has hinted at vying for governor after aspirant Thuo Mathenge asked him to run for reelection and support him for county boss.Kagwe spoke on Sunday at Ngangarithi AIPCA church, Nyeri town, where he and Thuo had attended a service.Thuo had told the congregation that he is one of the biggest employers in the county and deserves to be governor.But Kagwe told Thuo to stop panicking even before he declares his interest and wait until former Governor Nderitu Gachagua is buried so he can face him in the political arena. &ldquo;I will not speak politics in honour of the governor until he is buried,&rdquo; Kagwe said.Gachagua died on Friday in London, following a long battle with pancreatic cancer. Deputy Governor Samuel Wamathai was sworn in as governor yesterday.
