Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry Vihiga chapter has raised concern over double taxation to the business community by various organisations under Kenya Copyright Board.The chamber noted licenses regulated by KECOBO&rsquo;s Collective Management Organisations (CMOs) including Music Copyright Society of Kenya (MCSK), Kenya Association of Music Producers (KAMP) and Performers Rights Society of Kenya (PRISK) amount to double taxation.Chamber chief executive officer in the county, Geoffrey Vukaya, noted the lack of a clear plan of taxation by the CMOs was hurting the business premises that are forced to have many licenses, some that can&rsquo;t be explained.&ldquo;The local investors who have spent much of their investments in setting up these businesses are at pains to understand why these organisations are unable to collect fees under one umbrella and distribute royalties to intended players in music industry,&rdquo; Vukaya said.He noted one organisation charges between five to ten times more the charges of the other thus creating confusion, yet most traders do not understand what all these bodies stand for.&ldquo;The chamber has received many complaints from traders with regard to some licenses that seem to have an element of double taxation and no value for money. People don&rsquo;t understand why they must have up to four licenses all allied to the music industry,&rdquo; he said.He added, &ldquo;These investors spend their hard earned cash to set up business premises yet one organisation comes one day with police to rip off the electronics from the premises without trying to understand and explain to businesspersons.&rdquo;He said they are advocating for dialogue to resolve the matter and called upon KECOBO, MCSK, KAMP, PRISK, KAHC, Bar Owners Associations and other stakeholders to brainstorm on the issue or else the country will have more youths unemployed.He further asked the organisations to make the business community to understand the value for the money they pay as well as ensure the music industry players get their royalties for their hard work.&ldquo;Most music industry players hardly ever get their royalties and it&rsquo;s upon KECOBO to streamline this and not come up with other CMOs to collect for those not catered for,&rdquo; he said.He noted some of the CMO&rsquo;s erects roadblocks on major highways to inspect vehicles without following proper guidelines on how to set up the check points and which vehicles to be inspected in the case.He said the business community feels intimidated when these organisations use police to force shut their premises yet they have some other licenses of operation.Vukaya spoke on Friday at Gisambai.He urged the copyrights board to use the KNCCI that has 47 chapters, to reach out to the investors for ease of payment compliance without harassment.He noted that some major hotels in the county have been charged KAMP licences ranging from between Sh 58,000 to sh 90,000 yet the nomal SBP licence to run the bussinesses is not even sh 20,000.While commending Ministry of Industrialisation through CS Adan Mohamed for a great job in terms of trying to ensure that Kenya has improved its index rankings on ease of doing business, Vukaya noted this hasn&rsquo;t been fully implemented. &ldquo;The number of licenses keeps increasing by the day and this has made most youthful local investors to close shop. Recent survey results released, it was found the number of SMEs that have closed within the last five years are almost 2.2million,&rdquo; he said.He observed if on average these SMEs employed 3 persons then it simply means that almost 6.6million jobs have been lost in the last five years.
