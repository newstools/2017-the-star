The High Court has stopped the prosecution of political analyst Mutahi Ngunyi on charges of hate speech and ethnic contempt.Justice Joseph Onguto ruled on Tuesday that the trial which had been going on at a magistrate&rsquo;s court was "an abuse of the criminal justice system".Onguto prohibited further proceedings saying the NCIC was &ldquo;in a hurry to prosecute without giving the petitioner room to pursue the alternative window of conciliation&rdquo;.This was a core objective for the creation of the commission, with which former Law Society of Kenya chief executive Apollo Mboya filed a complaint.Ngunyi was summoned to record a statement over an August 19 2015 Twitter post in which he described Luos as poverty-stricken.The criminal case had been going on despite his public apology and the offer of a white goat to appease his accusers.Read: I am sorry, Mutahi Ngunyi tells 'poverty stricken' LuosAlso read: Youth rejects Ngunyi's 'poverty striken Luos' apology, demand LSK's Mboya returns goatOnguto upheld submissions by Ngunyi&rsquo;s lawyer Jennifer Shamalla to the effect that the prosecution should not have started its case before the words Ngunyi was accused of tweeting were put into their correct context.Shamalla had also faulted the process of investigations saying her client's rights were being violated.She also noted in her submissions that Ngunyi wrote to the NCIC to notify them of his intended conciliation.Shamalla said a similar reprieve was extended to former minister Chirau Mwakwere, whose case was dropped after he issued a public apology.The DPP and NCIC opposed the petition and wanted the case heard to conclusion.The prosecution was to amend the charges against Ngunyi on Wednesday. But case file number 1672/15 will now be closed unless the DPP appeals and the judge&rsquo;s decision is set aside.
