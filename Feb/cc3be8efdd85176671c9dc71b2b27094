Lawyers handling the trial of five people charged with the cold-blooded murders of lawyer Willie Kimani, his client and taxi driver yesterday rejected an offer to have a &ldquo;paperless trial&rdquo;, saying it is unsafe. The paperless trial would have meant the entire proceedings scheduled to begin on Monday next week and run on a daily basis until conclusion adopt an electronic-based system installed by the judiciary in 2014.The evidence would have then been transcribed after every two days, rather than having Justice Jessie Lesiit, who is handling the case, write down evidence as it has always been.The lawyers said although the technology would speed up the trial, it would be not be wise to rely on it. The lawyers include Cliff Ombeta, who represents AP officers Fredrick Leliman, Leonard Maina, Stephen Chebulet; Fred Ojiambo, who is acting for the victims, Law Society of Kenya, International Justice Mission; and Director of Public Prosecutions.The video conferencing installation of voice recognition technology were installed to speed up delivery of justice but they have never been successfully used although the Commercial Division of the High Court has been running a pilot Project.Kimani was killed alongside Josephat Mwenda and Joseph Muiruri on the night of June 23 at Soweto, Machakos. Their bodies were found in gunny bags at Oldonyo Sabuk river.Lawyers had been called by the court for a pretrial conference to confirm compliance ahead of next week&rsquo;s hearing, when the judge asked them if they would be confortable with the new technology. But they said they would have difficulties assessing the demeanour of witnesses and would have major problems too if the case goes to the Court of Appeal.The court also heard that the Chinese firm Company which was contracted to fix the gadgets did a shoddy job as it did not complete installing cameras.The equipment cannot send voice directly to the server and would require an IT expect to transfer it to a laptop, download it, take it to a transcriber and thereafter safe it in a hard drive.The lawyers suggested to either have the proceedings recorded and at the same time have the judge take notes saying there were apprehensive that the laptops could even be attacked by viruses or even the experts handling the evidence be kidnapped. In her ruling justice Lessit agreed to adopt the manual proceedings.
