Kenya Airways is considering offering higher wages to entice back dozens of engineers who quit the loss-making carrier to join Gulf-based airlines in the past year, chairman Michael Joseph said on Friday.The airline, part-owned by the state and part-owned by AirFrance KLM, sank into the red four years ago after tourism slumped following a spate of attacks in Kenya by militants from the Somalia-based al Shabaab terror group.Its financial predicament caused salary delays and industrial action, with 70 engineers quitting the carrier to join airlines mainly in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.The Kenyan airline has about 600 engineers. &ldquo;We have had an exodus of engineers from Kenya Airways ... We will be looking at some adjustments in packages and things like that to attract them back,&rdquo; Joseph, who was appointed in October, told reporters.He said they were also in discussions with pilots union, the Kenya Airline Pilots Association, to allow them hire foreign pilots on short-term contracts if the need arises.&ldquo;We may have a shortage of pilots as well,&rdquo; he said, adding the firm is seeking to lift the productivity and efficiency of existing pilots.Joseph said he was interviewing candidates to replace outgoing chief Executive Mbuvi Ngunze, who is set to leave at the end of next month.In November, KALPA had threatened an indefinite strike and had demanded the removal of the airline&rsquo;s previous chairman Dennis Awori and Ngunze.The new chairman said he expects interviews for the CEO post to be concluded by the end of this month.In the three months to December, the airline posted a four per cent increase in passenger numbers.A capital restructuring exercise, being led by PJT Partners, is set to be concluded by the end of March, Joseph said, without offering details.Kalpa secretary general Paul Gichinga told the Star on December 6 last year, that about 30 pilots had left the national carrier for greener pastures since August. By last August, Kenya Airways had about 450 pilots flying its fleet of 30 aircraft down from 525 one-and-a-half years earlier, Kalpa says.The airline needs about 490 pilots to operate optimally, Gichinga said, &ldquo;which will cater for annual leave&rdquo;.Kalpa had also claimed that Kenya Airways also has a shortage of more than 150 cabin crew which is affecting flight schedules.&ldquo;These people went ahead to retrench 39 cabin crew yet they already had a shortage. There is no one to fly,&rdquo; Gichinga had said.He had warned that more crew could leave if KQ management fails to put in place proper structures.
