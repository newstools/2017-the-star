The Kenya Airports Authority has said it will negotiate directly with affected families on compensation for the Sh5.6 billion expansion of Malindi Airport.It will not deal with residents as a group, to avoid conflicts, KAA says.Airport manager Walter Agong said on Thursday they will deal with affected families individually and agree on a compensation plan. The airport team met Kwachocha South and Kisumu Ndogo residents separately on February 8 and February 22.Agong said surveyors have been on the ground to map the land and identify those affected. In Kwachocha South, the government has already dispatched Sh300 million for compensating 130 families affected by the expansion. The funds are with the National Lands Commission, which will pay them.On the northern side of the airport, the authority wants 125 hectares to expand the runway from the current 1.4 kilometres to 2.5km. During a baraza in Furunzi on Wednesday last week, Kisumu Ndogo residents disagreed with KAA and complained it had brought surveyors on the ground without consulting them.But Agong said they will not deal with the public, adding that it is easy to negotiate with residents on a personal level. &ldquo;We want to deal with only those who will be affected,&rdquo; he said.Agong said they still have not identified landowners in the area of the project.He said the expansion will proceed as it is a government project and dismissed claims there were plans to relocate it to Lango Baya.Agong urged residents not to politicise the project and assured them due process will be followed and there will be no forced evictions. Residents, however, demanded the survey stopped until pending court cases are concluded. Agong denied knowledge of a court case, saying, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve not received a court order and don&rsquo;t know of pending court cases.&rdquo;
