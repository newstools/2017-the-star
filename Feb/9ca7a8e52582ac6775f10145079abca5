Infrastructure PS John Mosonik has urged Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua to stay away from national government road projects.The PS spoke at Kisukioni market in Matungulu subcounty while inspecting the construction of the Tala-Ol Donyo Sabuk road on Saturday.He criticised a recent Facebook post by the governor suggesting that the road was being done by the county.When inspecting the road last week, Mutua posted on his Facebook account, saying, &ldquo;Under the Maendeleo Chap Chap work formula, Machakos county has more road networks than any other county in Kenya.&rdquo;Mosonik said, &ldquo;I want to make it clear that this is a national government project and not the county government&rsquo;s as earlier alleged. The governor should, therefore, keep off as it is clear which roads are done by the counties and those done by the national government.&rdquo;He warned engineers who supervise construction of substandard roads that they risk being deregistered by the government.Mosonik said the construction of all roads across the country, whether under the national or county government, must comply with the set standards on quality and safety. &ldquo;As a ministry we have rolled out quality standards and sent out to the county governments for implementation and compliance. Anyone putting up a road must ensure they put into the design the safety of road users,&rdquo; he said. He said the ministry has so far forwarded several names to the Engineers Registration Board for disciplinary action against engineers who have been involved in overseeing shoddy work.Mosonik urged the residents of Machakos county to take advantage of the ongoing infrastructure expansion to expand business.&ldquo;This is a demonstration by the national government of its commitment to open up rural roads across the country to create more opportunities for trade and movement of goods and people,&rdquo; the PS said.He said the construction of the 35km road will cost Sh1 billion.
