The High Court yesterday annulled a decision by Sports Cabinet Secretary Hassan Wario to disband the National Olympic Committee of Kenya (NOCK).Justice George Odunga in a judgment said, Wario who took the hasty decision following complaints of mismanagement of Team Kenya during last year&rsquo;s Rio Olympics, had no powers under the Sports Act, to disband the committee.By purporting to do so, justice Odunga said Wario exceeded his jurisdiction. &ldquo;That decision must therefore be set aside,&rdquo; the judge added. The judge was of the view that the CS had not justified his action on any positive law.&ldquo;It is now trite that for an executive decision to be justified, it must be based on some legally recognized provisions or policy.&rdquo; The judge ruled. The suit had been lodged by Nock chairman Kipchoge Keino, Secretary General Francis Kinyiri and Treasurer Fridah Shiroya, who had told the judge that the decision to split the commission was unlawful and in breach of fair administrative action.The three, while pleading with the judge to intervene in the matter, said the move by the CS was in bad faith, unreasonable and which if not permanently stopped by the court, will lead to a ban of the Kenya&rsquo;s Olympic movement by the international Olympic committee (IOC).&ldquo;The CS has embarked on an unreasonable campaign of harassment through unnecessary use of police and security mechanism with the intention of unlawfully crippling the affairs and administration of Nock,&rdquo; they said.The CS had blamed Nock following the mismanagement of Team Kenya in Rio, Brazil last year, prompting public outrage.The CS castigated Nock officials for high handedness and mismanaging Team Kenya affairs, suggesting he had been powerless to stop this confusion from escalating considering the IOC rule book exclusively mandates them to manage the national team&rsquo;s affairs at the games. But in the ruling, justice Odunga said it was unlawful for the CS to purport to exercise powers not conferred on him.&ldquo;Executive power must be properly exercised within the lawful bounds or parameters and ought not to be misused or abuse,&rdquo; the judge said. The judge, also said CS decision was not covered under the Sports Act and therefore cannot be the subject of determination by the sports Tribunal as he had suggested.&ldquo;The respondents decision of August 25, 2016, disbanding Nock is hereby quashed,&rdquo; ruled Odunga.
