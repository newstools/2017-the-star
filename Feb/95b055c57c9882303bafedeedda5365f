Police have asked Kenyans to ignore a video recording of a burning bus claimed to have killed several people in an accident in Molo.The clip, that has been widely shared on social media, shows a bus up in flames after a collision with a trailer.Molo OCPD Daniel Kamanza told the Star on phone that the recording was of an accident that happened in 2015."It is aimed at causing panic among Kenyans. Ignore the rumours associated with the video recording," he said.Kamanza said two people were killed and 15 seriously injured in an accident at Mau Summit on Nairobi-Eldoret Highway on Monday."The accident occurred at around 2.30 am. It involved a Western Express Coach headed to Mumias and a truck which was on its way to Nakuru from Eldoret," he said.Molo traffic base commander Moses Nderitu said preliminary investigations showed the driver of the bus had tried overtaking the truck."The accident is believed to have been as a result of improper overtaking by the bus driver," said Nderitu.He said the two who died were the driver of the bus and his conductor."Well-wishers rushed the injured to hospitals whose names we are yet to establish because of the ongoing doctor's strike," he said.The bodies were taken to Molo hospital mortuary while the two vehicles were towed to Molo police station.Nderitu asked motorists to observe traffic rules to prevent accidents especially on the stretch from Mau Summit to Salgaa.He said freewheeling and speeding were the main causes of accidents in Salgaa, Sachangwan and Kibunja.Read: Sachangwan traffic offenders chose carrying signs over court, NTSA saysAlso read: Salgaa should be a dual carriageway
