Cord principal and Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula has denied claims he will be running for Bungoma governor if he does not clinch the NASA presidential ticket.Speaking to the Star after meeting Bungoma IEBC officials at a Bungoma hotel, Wetang&rsquo;ula said his eyes are firmly set on the presidential race.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to even speak about that propaganda. I want to be categorical that I am not interested in being Bungoma governor,&rdquo;he said.Wetang&rsquo;ula said he is concentrating on squaring it out with the opposition chiefs to become the presidential flagbearer. He added that he is ready to take up any role to remove Jubilee from power.&ldquo;I have told my people that I have gone hunting and they should be ready to accept whatever animal I bring back home,&rdquo; he said. Pressure has been mounting on Wetang&rsquo;ula from his close allies to drop his presidential bid and run for the Bungoma seat. Other sources indicate the senator was considering the option.Some MCAs allied to him have publicly said only Wetang&rsquo;ula can beat Governor Kenneth Lusaka, saying other candidates who had declared the quest on NASA affiliate parties are weak. Those running for the seat include Bungoma businessman Wycliffe Wangamati.
