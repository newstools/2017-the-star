A revolt against the Jubilee Party in Maasai land has compelled President Uhuru Kenyatta to a select a new team to sell the party.The new team does not comprise politicians. A month ago, a delegation visited State House and told Uhuru all was not well with Jubilee on the ground.The President's team is headed by Agriculture PS Richard Lesiyiampe to ensure Kajiado, Narok and Samburu counties do not support the opposition.Others are National Transport and Safety Authority director general Francis Meja, PSs Charles Sunkuli (Environment) and Saitoti Torome (Planning).The team also comprises Geothermal Development Company MD Johnson Nchoe, Kenya Water Towers Agency director general Francis ole Nkako and former East African Portland Cement Company MD Kepha Tande.Sources close to the presidency told the Star yesterday Uhuru and Ruto have been evaluating the performance of elected leaders in Maasai land after several of them decamped to the opposition.&ldquo;The President and Deputy President have been doing some soul-searching to understand why they have tried to appease the region with government appointments and flagship projects, yet the people are still unhappy,&rdquo; said a source.&ldquo;What happened in Narok during Ole Ntimama's burial, when government officials were ridivuled, is said to have offended the President and his Deputy. This is the reason why the two leaders did not attend John Keen&rsquo;s burial in Namanga late last year.&rdquo;The President is said to have been angered by the cold reception, yet the state funded Ntimama's burial.There were reports the government spent Sh170 million to campaign for Patrick Tutui in the Kajiado Central by-election, but he was defeated by Memusi Kanchori of ODM. The seat fell vacant after Joseph Nkaissery was appointed Interior Cabinet Secretary.
