Four Kiambu governor aspirants have denied endorsing Kabete MP Ferdinand Waititu.They are businessman James Nyoro, real estate mogul James Kariuki, trader John Mugwe and businesswoman Aquiline Njoki.During a Citizen TV show on Saturday evening, Waititu said the hopefuls agreed to step down for him to run against the incumbent, William Kabogo.Earlier in the day, Waititu had joined the aspirants for a peace rally in St Patrick&rsquo;s Grounds, Thika. Yesterday, Nyoro said, &ldquo;I never announced anywhere that I am going to unite with Waititu or step down for him. Such reckless statements should be treated with the contempt they deserve. I am in the race for governor.&rdquo;Mugwe said, &ldquo;I have never sat down with Waititu to discuss any merger nor have I told him I would step down for him. It was suggested at the peace rally that we unite to serve Kiambu people, but Waititu, with his usual self-centeredness, went on TV to say we have stepped down for him.&ldquo;He should be ashamed of himself and the people of Kiambu should ignore the remarks.&rdquo; Njoki said she has not formed any alliance with Waititu and will run for governor. The aspirants said they will not be part of any coalition whose main agenda is to unseat Kabogo. They said they are focussed on service delivery. &ldquo;Kiambu residents deserve leaders who are focussed on development,&rdquo; Mugwe said. Kabogo and Waititu are bitter rivals. Last month, Waititu slapped a Sh50 million legal fee on Kabogo.The fee arose from a suit Kabogo had filed, questioning the Panjab University degree that Waititu holds. Waititu won the suit last December after a court ruled it lacked jurisdiction to decide the dispute. The MP filed a bill of costs and is seeking an order compelling Kabogo to offset the Sh50.9 million accrued.
