ODM has dismissed as cosmetic, President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s decree that IDs be provided to residents within three days of application.On Thursday, director of political affairs Opiyo Wandayi said the directive has not been implemented in the opposition&rsquo;s strongholds.&ldquo;Thousands of IDs of Siaya residents are lying in Nairobi despite Uhuru&rsquo;s firm instructions that they be processed and delivered to owners within three days. These people applied for the document in November last year,&rdquo; he said.Wandayi said the directive is only being implemented in Jubilee strongholds. Uhuru had told chiefs to deliver IDs to residents and not wait for them to visit their offices.He accused Jubilee of plotting to disenfranchise voters allied to the opposition. Wandayi urged Uhuru to order Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery to urgently release IDs.&ldquo;If Uhuru meant what he said, he should order the director at the Immigration department to ensure the directive is actualised to end the growing anxiety among Kenyans,&rdquo; he said.Wandayi expressed concern about voter apathy in opposition strongholds.He said a different strategy will be devised to woo residents to register.Raila summons leadersLast week, Cord leader Raila Odinga summoned opposition leaders from Nyanza to discuss the poor turnout during listing.Speaking in Nyakach subcounty, Raila said every elected leader is responsible for ensuring residents in their region register to vote.
