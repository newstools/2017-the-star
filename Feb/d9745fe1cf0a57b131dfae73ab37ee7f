Shareholders of the collapsed Imperial Bank have filed a case to have chiefs at the regulator, Central Bank of Kenya, sent to jail for six months for disobeying a court order.The beleaguered former directors of the mid-tier lender wants governor Patrick Njoroge put behind bars, in a new twist to the ongoing bitter battle between the two parties.The shareholders of the troubled bank are accusing CBK boss, board, and the Kenya Deposit Insurance Corporation of failing to obey an order requiring them to share information on receivership.The details that were supposed to be shared with shareholders included things like whether loans have been collected and how much has been collected.Also to be shared was information on any arrangements entered into with any third party such as NIC bank, Diamond Trust Bank and Kenya Commercial bank in relation to Imperial Bank, according to judgment by Justice George Odunga. The judge had said he can't stop the liquidation if it has been done as per the law, but ordered KDIC to share information about the receivership with shareholders and depositors.And now the shareholders want the CBK boss and board be given a 30-day ultimatum to show up in court to show cause why contempt proceedings should not be instigated against them.The shareholders said the disobedience of the order amounts to ridiculing the authority of the court, and people found culpable should be punished.The compliance of the orders of Odunga will go a long way in saving the bank from imminent liquidation, they said.The CBK closed Imperial Bank on October 13, 2015, following discovery of massive fraud at the mid-tier lender, which at the time held Sh58 billion in customer deposits.The CBK on December 28 announced that depositors of the troubled bank receive a minimum of Sh200,000 and a maximum of 10 per cent of their remaining cash."The Kenya Deposit Insurance Corporation will today commence a third disbursement of funds to depositors," Njoroge had said in a statement.Last July, the KDIC announced that depositors of the collapsed Bank will access up to Sh1.5 million each, a move which was unsuccessfully contested in court by the beleaguered directors."They will access these funds through the NIC Bank as was the case for the second disbursement in July 2016," Njoroge said. "Any new claims should be lodged and processed through NIC Bank."He said Imperial Bank borrowers should continue repaying their loans as required.
