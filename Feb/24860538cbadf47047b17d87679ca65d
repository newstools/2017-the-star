Newly promoted Technical University of Kenya men&rsquo;s team have beefed up squad ahead of this year&rsquo;s Kenya Hockey Union Premier League. The varsity side have so far recruited four players including utility player Alex Nyawira from Bay club, strikers Richard Otieno and Ian Wasike and defender Lamuel Mang&rsquo;ong&rsquo;o from secondary schools.TUK captain and defender Moses Obushuru observed: &ldquo;The good thing is that our squad which won the national league title is still intact and i hope they will gel well with the new recruits going forward.&rdquo;He said they are keen on making an impact in the league on their debut. TUK, who earned a promotion to the top tier after topping the national league last season, are however, aware of the stiff competition which awaits them.Obushuru said they are aware the top tier is as totally different ball game but they are ready to prove that their promotion was no fluke.&ldquo;We earned the promotion on merit and we are keen to prove our worth in the league. We know it&rsquo;s not going to be easy but we have already embarked on pre-season build-up matches. Our participation in the ongoing Kenya University Sports Association (KUSA) games is also putting us in the competition mood already,&rdquo; noted Obushuru.He continued: &ldquo;Last weekend, we played a friendly against premier league champions Strathmore University and lost 3-0. We are not focusing on the loss but the lessons we picked from the match and we keen to make amends before the league rolls off.&rdquo;Obushuru, however, decried lack of training facility at the varsity. &ldquo;We pay to pay at the Railway Training Institute in South C but thew facility is still sub-standard.&rdquo;TUK earned promotion to the top tier alongside Wazalendo Youth but latter have remained non-committal on joining the top tier.
