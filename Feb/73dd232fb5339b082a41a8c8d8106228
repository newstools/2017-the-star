Thika security officers have banned politicians and their supporters from printing placards with inciting messages. Deputy county commissioner Tom Anjere on Monday said hate messages in political rallies have been causing tension between rival politicians and even led to chaos. He warned leaders against using abusive language against their opponents. Recently during President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s visit, chaos broke out when supporters of incumbent MP Alice Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a and those of her fierce rival Patrick Wainaina clashed as they wanted the placards bearing the names of their candidates seen by the President. Uhuru condemned the violence and told the youth to stop putting their lives on the line for politicians who don&rsquo;t care about them and will forget them soon after they are elected.
