Kenya National Commission on Human Rights chairperson Kagwiria Mbogori yesterday criticised the government for delaying implementation of the Public Benefit Organisations Act of 2013.She also faulted the government for moving the NGOs Board from the Devolution to the Interior ministry. Mbogori said the state is applying delay tactics to continue using obsolete laws to annihilate civil society organisations. The civil society sector is regulated by the Non-Governmental Organisations Coordination Act of 1990.&ldquo;First of all, this law was enacted at a period when dissent was frowned upon and the democratic space was limited. Any attempt to create a voice outside government would normally be met with the &lsquo;full force of the law&rsquo;,&rdquo; Mbogori said in Nairobi yesterday. &ldquo;This law though present didn&rsquo;t do much to protect CSOs as they were declared public enemy number one during the single-party state, whilst the law existed.&rdquo; Mbogori said the PBO Act is important legislations for the public and a beam of hope for CSOs, but it has been neglected by the government.
