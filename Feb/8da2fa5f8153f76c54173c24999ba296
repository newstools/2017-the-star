IN such a small world as ours, it is not strange to come across people who bear a striking resemblance to each other. Little-known Jesse Kinyanjui, who works at a hotel in Nairobi&rsquo;s Upper Hill, shares so many similar features with Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka that neighbours and friends in his Kiambu home simply call him Kalonzo. The two have never met, but their uncanny resemblance shows we in Kenya are indeed one big family.***** THERE was a light moment yesterday in the Senate, when Tana River Senator Ali Bule, who was elected on the Federal Party of Kenya ticket, appeared to be undecided on which side of the Senate he would sit.Soon after he entered the House, resuming from a two-month recess, he momentarily walked towards the opposition benches before quickly making a u-turn and heading straight to the government side. Bule, who is known for his humorous moves while in the House, left Kisumu Senator Anyang&rsquo; Nyong&rsquo;o in stiches.***** SOON after Justice Chacha Mwita ruled to extend the final national mass voter registration by two days, MPs from both Jubilee and Cord were overheard along the corridors of Parliament saying that although the extension was a blessing in disguise, the courts had gone too far in rulings that derail the calendar of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission. The MPs feel that Chief Justice David Maraga should intervene and give his opinion on the injunctions that in their view were now too many.***** A legislator from the South Rift is at a crossroads. Reason? He was overheard yesterday at a high-end city hotel telling a member of staff at Parliament that he was divided as to whom he should support between incumbent Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto and National Assembly Deputy Speaker Joyce Laboso, who is keen on dethroning Rutto. &ldquo;Tell me the truth,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;how is the ground? Mama [Laboso] is my friend and I don&rsquo;t know how to go about this thing,&rdquo; the vocal MP told the staffer.***** A senior procurement officer at a medical NGO is alleged to have irregularly awarded Sh583 million equipment to a company that&rsquo;s not qualified to provide software equipment. The World Bank had advanced the organisation a loan to procure and install computer software in selected counties on behalf of the Ministry of Health, as a pilot project to safeguard patients&rsquo; data in the county hospitals. The Ministry advised that the tender be re-advertised because some of the companies being considered were not qualified.
