A witch doctor will use charms to guard Senator Kiraitu Murungi's votes in the race for Meru governor during the August 8 poll.Tigania East MP Mpuru Aburi brought on board the renowned witch doctor from his constituency, introducing him alongside some Njuri Ncheke elders.Aburi said that the witch doctor, known as Kaana ka Njoka, has powers to deal with those who will not vote for Kiraitu."If you don&rsquo;t vote for Kiraitu and he points at you, you are no more. We want to prove to you that in Tigania, we are not supporting that man," Aburi said in remarks viewed to be targeting Governor Peter Munya.Last week, Munya dismissed Kiraitu&rsquo;s confidence of defeating him at the ballot.

When you get close to Aburi, I can bite you and you will not survive," Mugambi said."I talked to him and we agreed to play as defenders of Kiraitu&rsquo;s politics. Whoever plays with him, I will spit on him and he will not survive," he added."As you see my pockets are full. They are not full of money. These are charms to protect and defend the votes of Kiraitu and Aburi," the witchdoctor said.The magician said voters in Tigania East voted for Munya because he was Kiraitu&rsquo;s preferred candidate."At the moment, Munya has lost ground in all Meru constituencies," Mugambi said, further asking those at the meeting to mock Munya.The meeting was attended by more than 2,000 delegates from South Imenti.Igembe South MP Mithika Linturi and Meru County Assembly deputy speaker Gideon Kimathi and a host of aspirants from the constituency were present.The decision is likely to contravene requirements of the Elections Act, 2011 (68)(1) which outlaws any form of undue influence on the voter.The laws states that any candidate who impedes or disenfranchises a voter commits an offence. "Threats to use any force, violence - including sexual violence; restraint, or material, physical or spiritual injury, harmful cultural practices, damage or loss, or any fraudulent device, trick or deception for the purpose of or on account of elections are illegal," the law states.Also read: Alfred Mutua takes campaigns to Meru as Munya tours Kajiado
