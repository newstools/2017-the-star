Politicians have appealed to the electoral agency to extend the national mass voter registration beyond Tuesday. The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission has said it will not extend the listing, which started on January 16.Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula has urged the IEBC to extend the registration by two weeks. Speaking after meeting party aspirants on Saturday in Kanduyi, Bungoma county, he said there are many Kenyans waiting for their IDs.&ldquo;Some Kenyans have already applied for IDs, which have been delayed contrary to President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s directive that they be processed in three days. We want the exercise extended so they are not denied their right to vote,&rdquo; he said.Wetang&rsquo;ula, who was with Tongaren MP Eseli Simiyu and his Kabuchai counterpart James Lusweti, said many Kenyans would be left out if the period is not extended.His appeal comes four days after Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka urged the IEBC to extend the registration. &ldquo;Potential voters are still waiting for their IDs and we hope the government will fast-track the process so they register,&rdquo; he said.Last month, Samburu leaders also called for extension of the period in arid areas, saying drought has affected registration.Samburu West MP Lati Lelelit said it is unfair to group pastoral counties with the rest of Kenyans. There has been poor turnout in pastoral areas, with IEBC records showing only 12,112 people have registered in West Pokot county since the exercise started.United Democratic Movement presidential candidate Philip Murgor said extending the period will ensure Kenyans enjoy their constitutional right.He said ID issuing is not as fast in opposition strongholds as it is in Jubilee&rsquo;s. &ldquo;The government is systematically denying potential voters IDs in opposition strongholds so they do not get voter&rsquo;s cards,&rdquo; Murgor said.He said the National Registration Bureau should speed up the release of new IDs. Murgor urged all Kenyans to register as voters and take part in building the nation.
