The drought situation in Northern Kenya is likely to worsen, as the latest forecast shows it will not rain in the region this month. The February weather report shows there will be light rains around Lake Victoria Basin, the highlands West of and the Central Rift Valley and might spread over to Central Kenya and Nairobi. Most of these areas will have cloudy mornings even when there is no rainfall, which might keep temperatures cool. The light rains could also help improve water supply in Nairobi. On Saturday, acting meteorological services director Peter Ambenje said the rest of the country will be dry. &ldquo;The forecast for February 2017 indicates that the better part of the country will still be generally sunny and dry throughout the month.&rdquo; The ongoing drought and pasture shortage, particularly in Northern Kenya, have led to the death of livestock. Relief food is being distributed. Ambenje said the entire Northern region, including Lodwar, Lokichoggio, Marsabit, Garissa and Wajir, the lower areas of Makindu and Machakos and the entire coastal strip, will be sunny and dry. This is consistent with past weather patterns for this month. &ldquo;February is normally a dry month over most parts of the country,&rdquo; he said. While January started hot and dry, large amounts of rainfall came in the last weeks of the month. Ambenje said the showers stopped because the rain-bearing inter-tropical convergence zone migrated southwards to Tanzania, leaving most parts of Kenya under sunny and dry weather. &ldquo;There was also cooling of sea surface temperatures over the Eastern Pacific Ocean, which led to drier conditions,&rdquo; he said. The current drought is because of poor rains during the 2016 October-December season. Agriculture PS Richard Lesiyampe assured Kenyans there is enough maize to last until June.
