Kisii woman representative Mary Sally Otara has joined the Jubilee Party after ditching ODM. Otara now follows in the footsteps of Senator Chris Obure and Deputy Governor Joash Maangi, who ditched the opposition for the ruling party. Otara was received by JP officials and supporters in Sameta Boys&rsquo; High School, Bobasi constituency. Those present at the meeting included Obure, Albert Nyaundi, Charles Nyachae, Stephen Manoti, Joel Onyancha, Jimmy Angwenyi, Richard Tong&rsquo;i, Zebedeo Opore, Simon Ogari and Elijah Moindi. Otara accused ODM of sidelining her. &ldquo;I have remained loyal to ODM, but the leadership has literally chased me away. They no longer involve me in party programmes. They seem to have preferred candidates,&rdquo; she said. It is believed Otara left the party after nominated Senator Janet Ong&rsquo;era declared her candidacy for the seat on an ODM ticket. Ong&rsquo;era is seen as Governor James Ongwae&rsquo;s favourite.Kisii woman representative Mary Sally Otara has joined the Jubilee Party after ditching ODM.
