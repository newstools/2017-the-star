There is a danger that the IEBC may be unable to work within the remaining five-and-a-half months to deliver the general election.The court ruling that cancelled the contract to print the August 8 ballot papers has just immensely complicated the IEBC&rsquo;s work.Cord challenged the deal awarded to a Dubai-based company, arguing due process was not followed.The IEBC does not have enough time, it seeks permission to single source, a company is hurriedly sought and agrees to print the ballots quickly, but at an exorbitant price, and the taxpayer bears the burden.A lot of litigation goes on in Kenya, with companies that lose tenders immediately petitioning for a review. Unless there is clear misconduct, the losing bidders should not hold important national undertakings hostage in a gamble for profits.And the courts need to raise the thresholds. Why should the entire country be at risk of not holding a scheduled election because of some obscure business rivalry?
