Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria has urged residents to reelect him because &ldquo;my development record speaks for itself.&rdquo;&ldquo;I have only served for two-and-a half years, but managed to do more than MPs who have been in office since 2013,&rdquo; he said. Kuria spoke on Monday after commissioning road projects.He also urged residents to register to vote and ensure President Uhuru Kenyatta is reelected. &ldquo;Ensure Cord leader Raila does not become President because my life would be in danger and I might be forced into exile,&rdquo; Kuria said.&ldquo;He called for my imprisonment when I said boys should be circumcised, yet I was actually talking of my sons. You can imagine what would happen to me if he takes over the government.&rdquo;Kuria said he has developed Gatundu South. &ldquo;All homes have electricity, we have a medical training institute, a Lands office and a cereals board store,&rdquo; he said.Kuria said he will run for MP, despite being urged to vie for governor or senator. &ldquo;For now, I am asking you to give me another term as MP, then maybe later I can seek higher office,&rdquo; the legislator said.Kuria said leadership requires fearless leaders &ldquo;who can go to any length&rdquo; to take services to the people.Kuria has been accused of making inciting remarks on many occasions. In an obscene posting last December, he threatened to insert a broken bottle into Mbita MP Millie Odhiambo for insulting the President.
