The Jubilee Party candidates in the Mombasa governor race have denied they are feuding.Suleiman Shahbal and his running mate Ananiah Mwaboza termed reports there is serious infighting propaganda.Last week, Jubilee supporters, mostly those allied to Mwaboza, summoned him. They were angered by the alleged &ldquo;second-class&rdquo; treatment they receive since he agreed to shelve his governor ambitions. The group said it is not involved in decisionmaking.But during a rally in Mombasa on Saturday, Mwaboza said &ldquo;People need not be angry about the lies. We must work together for our own good.&rdquo; Shahbal said, &ldquo;We are firmly together come rain, come shine.&rdquo;
