The lure of the riches of reaching the group stages of the CAF Champions League will spur Tusker on, when they kick start their campaign against St. Louis ofMauritius tomorrow at Moi, Kasarani, skipper James Situma has stated.&ldquo;Obviously the financial benefits of reaching the group stages are huge for both the club and the players and that is a big motivation factor for us,&rdquo; said the experienced defender, who has now fully recovered from a knee injury that locked him out of the latter stages of last season when the brewers managed to win the Kenya Premier League and cup double&ldquo;I am feeling very alright and I can now train and play normally. We are all looking forward to the match against St. Louis. Very few fans are giving us a chance due the past performance of Kenyan clubs but from my experience, it&rsquo;s all about good preparations and having the necessary mental strength to overcome adversity. I believe if we win in the first leg we can go far,&rdquo; he added.The Kenyan champions have set their sights on a first leg win when they tackle St. Louis in the first leg of the CAF Champions League tomorrow. The brewers, who have set camp at the match venue, have no injury concerns ahead of what will be coach George Nsiimbe&rsquo;s first match in charge of the brewers.&ldquo;We are fortunate that all the players are fit and hopefully, they will all be ready for the match tomorrow,&rdquo; remarked Nsimbe. The Ugandan tactician admitted that his charges were under pressure to end the country&rsquo;s poor run in the lucrative African football competition.&ldquo;We are aware of the tough task at hand but we are very much ready for our opponents and our target is to get a win and try and keep a clean sheet,&rdquo; Nsimbe said.The Ugandan tactician opined that his experience at the continental level with Ugandan outfit KCC will be crucial to the brewers&rsquo; aspiration.&ldquo;At KCC, we managed to do well and hopefully, I can transfer my experiences to Tusker and at least reach the group stages,&rdquo; Nsimbe stated.Despite making nine new signings among them shot stopper Byrne Omondi, defenders Marlon Tangauzi, Vincent Omumbo, Samuel Olwande, midfielders Sydney Ochieng, Moses Ndawula, Abdul Hillary, Evans Ochieng and Victor Ndinya, the Tusker coach revealed he will stick to the &lsquo;tried and tested squad&rsquo; that brought success back to Ruaraka last season.
