Proposed changes to parliamentary rules now make it harder for political parties to discipline errant members by de-whipping them from committees.The Parliament leadership has recommended the Standing Orders be amended to give affected MPs a fair hearing, before they are de-whipped from committees.Recall from House panels, where MPs earn lucrative sitting allowances and benefit from foreign trips, is a dreaded form of discipline for an MP.The 11th Parliament has been marked with controversies over the process and reason for recall of MPs from committees, often bringing to question the intent and motive.The current Standing Orders &ndash; House Rules and for Procedure &ndash; give whips sweeping powers to de-whip members and reorganise committees without giving member a recourse.Affected MPs have often accused their parties of witch-hunt, dictatorship and blackmail in reconstitution of committees.The opposition's move to de-whip 12 MPs from committees in the last session alone allegedly over their dalliance with Jubilee, sparked outrage in the plenary.Among the MPs de-whipped are Ken Obura (Kisumu Central), Samuel Arama (Nakuru Town West), Dalmas Otieno (Rongo) and Zainab Chidzuga (Kwale woman representative).MPs argued that a party should not be allowed to recall its members arbitrarily and called for amendment to the rules to give the plenary a say.Critics have explained that recalling MPs from committees, the engines of parliamentary business, is unconstitutional as it denies affected members their mandate for representation, oversight and legislation. Under the current Standing Order 176 the parliamentary party that nominated a member to a select committee, may give notice, in writing, to the Speaker that the member is to be discharged from a select team. The discharge of a member shall take effect upon receipt by the Speaker.But under the proposed changes, the House will now have the final say in the discharge of any member from a committee regardless of request from a political party.&ldquo;Review the current procedure in Standing Order 176 on de-whipping of members to allow for a process of fair hearing and fair administrative action for those affected, as envisioned under Articles 47 and 50 of the Constitution,&rdquo; reads the resolution by the National Assembly leadership.ODM has already backed the amendments to reduce parties&rsquo; authority to de-whip, discipline or remove members from House committees, without plenary approval.&ldquo;If one morning, a whip wakes up, he has the power to de-whip everybody in his party and they can go home,&rdquo; opposition Whip Thomas Mwadeghu said. The Wundanyi MP said it&rsquo;s necessary to prevent chief whips from punishing members whenever they feel like, even without consulting their parties.
