Lamu residents living in the vast Boni forest could miss out in the mass voter registration, which ends on February 14.Most residents abandoned their homes after the government started the Linda Boni Operation to flush out al Shabaab militants after terror attacks in 2014.Those affected are residents of Basuba, Milimani, Mararani, Kiangwe and Mangai.Reports indicate some of them fled to Kiunga, while others went to Faza, Mkokoni and Lamu. They fear returning home due to security reasons.On Sunday, the residents urged Governor Issa Timamy to help them to register.Yusuf Chitete, a former councillor of Basuba, said most residents fled the ward.Speaking during a meeting with the governor in Miririni village, Chitete said voter transfer is also difficult because they are unable to travel to Lamu East constituency headquarters at Faza.He said the residents are willing to travel to their villages but they do not know how to get there because they rely on security vehicles.Chitete said 30 families from Mangai and Basuba enrolled their 150 children in Miririni schools.The Awer is a forest community as it relies on honey, herbs and traditional fruits.Their economic lives have been affected the movement.Chitete said the IEBC should reach out to the residents and register them.&ldquo;Our economy has gone down. People have been tortured by Kenya Defence Forces and travelling is difficult for them,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said.Timamy said voter registration is a concern for Boni Forest communities.&ldquo;Due to the ongoing security operation, many residents of Boni or the Awers, who fled to Kiunga, Madina and Mkokoni have not been sensitised on voter registration. They do not intend to go back to their homes and transfer their stations," he said.Timamy said the Boni people are poor and cannot travel to Faza to transfer their votes.He said the turnout is still very low.
