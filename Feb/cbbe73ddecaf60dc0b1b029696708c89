Before devolution, Lamu was one of the orphaned regions, completely shunned by doctors. Others included Mandera, Pokot, Turkana and Wajir.Today, the county is positioning itself as an employer of choice by offering superior terms to its health employees.Health chief executive Dr Mohammed Kombo says the county allocates 40 per cent of its budget to health.&ldquo;I am a medical doctor and I worked in Lamu before devolution. I can tell you things have now changed. We are building new hospitals, refurbishing the old ones and buying medical equipment. We are lucky because Governor Issa Timamy has a heart for health,&rdquo; he says.Fully operational Nurses and clinical officers working in Lamu did not go on strike in December last year, when the rest of their colleagues across Kenya downed their tools.The county has 127 nurses, a consultant doctor, nine medical officers and 38 clinical officers.Some of their doctors are not on strike and are still offering much-needed health services in public hospitals.Dr Kombo has also left his office and now works full-time at King Fahd County Referral Hospital.&ldquo;Our success started with the nurses,&rdquo; he says.Lamu branch divorced itself from the Kenya National Union of Nurses last year, accusing the national office of mismanagement.Lamu county signed a recognition agreement with the local branch and now remits members subscriptions fees directly to them.Other counties remit the fees directly to the Knun national office, which then sends a part of the money back to branches.The Knun national office is accused of failing to remit the money to about 10 branches.Lamu's clinical officers also did not join the national strike in December.&ldquo;We have promised them whatever national government will offer the nurses, we will also give it to them,&rdquo; Dr Kombo says.Services at the county hospitals are now fully operational.Dr Kombo says before the doctors' strike on December 5, they were in the process of hiring three new doctors.&ldquo;Two have already reported. One is stationed at King Fahd Referral Hospital and the other one at Mpeketoni Hospital,&rdquo; he says.Dr Kombo has also left his office to fully work at the hospital until the national strike ends.&ldquo;I am working at King Fahd. This is how we have managed to survive,&rdquo; he says.Dr Kombo regrets that about nine of Lamu's other doctors decided to join the KMPDU strike.He fully supports the demands by the KMPDU, but argues that leaving patients for dead is not right.&ldquo;Doctors are professionals and must be compensated well. They are very disciplined and when I was in medical school, we never went on strike, even though the main campus students were always on strike,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;However, there is no reason to kill people because of money. Money will never be enough.&rdquo;History of national strike About 3,000 doctors working in public hospitals countrywide went on strike on December 5, demanding implementation of their 2013 CBA.The 27-page document was signed on June 27, 2013 by KMPDU officials and the Health ministry.The agreement suspended the proposed salaries and allowances until the Salaries and Remuneration Commission sets out guidelines for remuneration of doctors in public service.The union then moved to the Labour Court in June 2015, seeking registration of the CBA.Doctors also insisted they are not county employees, but of the national government.In her ruling on October 6 last year, Lady Justice Monica Mbaru termed the 2013 CBA invalid, saying it does not comply with the law and cannot be registered.&ldquo;Without such registration, the collective bargaining agreement has no legal effect and cannot be enforced,&rdquo; she said.Mbaru asked doctors to embrace the reality of devolution and the fact that most of them are now employed by county governments.&ldquo;It will aid justice, fair labour practice and effective administration of the CBA to include major stakeholders &mdash; county governments,&rdquo; she said.She directed the union, the ministry, county governments, and the salaries and remuneration commission to prepare a new CBA in 90 days.The union did not appeal the ruling. They called a strike within the first month and refused to negotiate a new CBA.Labour Court judge Hellen Wasilwa last month declared the strike illegal and ordered doctors to return to negotiations.The old CBA, which doctors want implemented, raises their salaries by nearly 300 per cent. The lowest paid medic, an intern, would earn Sh325,000 every month, up from Sh127,000. A consultant would earn close to Sh1 million every month.Public Service Commission chair Prof Margaret Kobia says such salaries will distort the public service pay structure and burden Kenyans with an additional Sh12 billion every year.The government has since offered the 5,000 doctors in public service an additional Sh4 billion, pushing the monthly salary of an intern to Sh208,000.
