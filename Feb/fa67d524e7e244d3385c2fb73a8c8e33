Budalang&rsquo;i parliamentary aspirant Leonard Obimbira has told MP Ababu Namwamba to brace himself for a bruising battle.&ldquo;I have rolled up my sleeves and will vie on the ODM ticket,&rdquo; he said, during his farewell and dinner party at Hotel Itoya on Friday night.Obimbira was Busia county Finance executive. He said poverty has reached alarming levels, with people queueing for bursaries beyond the expected limits.&ldquo;There is no conducive environment for doing business in Budalang&rsquo;i. Misuse and theft of CDF funds is the order of the day. We need to stop this worrying trend,&rdquo; he said.Obimbira said crime and harassment of fishermen have taken centre stage in the area. The area MP has left the situation unabated instead of using the assembly to move a motion that would force the national government to ensure fishermen&rsquo;s security, Obimbira said.He narrated the challenges he faced as the Finance executive, saying inadequate funds and piecemeal release by the national government marred his four-year tenure.Busia county assembly speaker Bernard Wamalwa delivered Governor Sospeter Ojaamong&rsquo;s apologies and described Obimbira as a man of character. He thanked him for the bold decision of jumping into the political arena. &ldquo;Painful decisions have to be made. ODM leader Raila Odinga took more than two decades to realise the country&rsquo;s second liberation and about three decades to perfect the system,&rdquo; Ojaamong said. Busia ODM chairman Patrick Ombogoya described Obimbira as good, quiet and a go-getter.
