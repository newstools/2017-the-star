A white US Navy veteran has been arrested for allegedly killing an Indian immigrant engineer and wounding two others at a crowded sports bar.Adam Purinton, 51, was taken into custody at a bar in an Applebee's in Clinton, Missouri, after telling an employee he had just shot 'Middle Eastern' men and needed a place to hide. He was arrested about five hours after police say he opened fire at Austin's Bar and Grill in Olathe, Kansas.The deadly confrontation began unfolding inside the lounge at around 7.15pm on Wednesday and later spilled out into the parking lot.Police say Purinton shot and killed Srinivas Kuchibhotla, an engineer at Garmin, wounded his colleague Alok Madasani.He then fired at a third man, identified as Ian Grillot, who had tried to intervene.At least one witness said Purtinton yelled 'get out of my country' and claimed he heard him screaming racial slurs before opening fire, according to Kansas City Star.The 51-year-old veteran apparently thought Kuchibhotla and Madasani were Middle Eastern, although in reality both men were of Indian decent.Kuchibhotla died at an area hospital and Alok Madasani and Ian Grillot were hospitalized, the latter suffering from wounds to his hand and shoulder. Garret Bohnen, a bartender at Austins, confirmed to the Star that Kuchibhotla and Madasani worked at the Olathe-based GPS maker Garmin and would come the bar for a drink once or twice a week.'From what I understand when he was throwing racial slurs at the two gentlemen, Ian stood up for them,' Bohnen said. 'We're all proud of him.'The shooting happened while people were watching the University of Kansas-TCU basketball game at Austins, said Olathe Police Sgt. Logan Bonney.Purinton was taken into custody just after midnight on Thursday morning at an Applebee's about 70 miles to the southeast in Clinton, Missouri, authorities said.Assistant Clinton Police Chief Sonny Lynch said an Applebee's bartender summoned police to the bar where the man was drinking because he said he'd been involved in a shooting.
