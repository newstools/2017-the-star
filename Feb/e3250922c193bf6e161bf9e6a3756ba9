Elgeyo Marakwet Woman rep Susan Chebet publicly clashed with a governor aspirant over the construction of Sh24 billion dam in Keiyo South.Former Sasini Group of Companies MD Moses Changwony told Soy South residents, where the Talal Dam will be built, to reject the project until the government clarifies on how they will be compensated.Changwony claimed the Kerio Valley Development Authority was planning to construct the multipurpose dam without consulting the locals.His remarks come in the wake of resistance of other dams - Arror and Kimwarer multipurpose dams in the county.The gubernatorial aspirant asked locals to reject construction of the dam without proper consultations, lauding locals of Kipsaiya location, Marakwet West, who have vehemently rejected construction of proposed Arror dam without consultation on compensation and resettlement of locals.&ldquo;Am told KVDA is rushing to construct Talal dam in Soy after facing resistance in Marakwet because they think Keiyo locals are easy to manipulate. I urge Keiyo locals to firm as they demand for they right for compensation,&rdquo; Changwony said.His remarks were dismissed by Chebet who asked locals to welcome the project, saying they will benefit from the water supply.&ldquo;We have suffered for a long time because of lack of water. Some of these leaders should not mislead residents,&rdquo; Chebet said.Soy South MCA Gilbert Kaptugen faulted Changwony, saying his criticism may lead to suspension and even relocation of the project to another county.&ldquo;This project is our fair share of state resources. How can any leaders oppose such a massive project?&rdquo; Kaptugen said.The leaders were speaking at a meeting in Kimwarer in Kerio Valley at the weekend.Police in Marakwet were forced to use teargas to disperse angry locals who disrupted a public awareness meeting conducted by KVDA near the proposed Arror dam.The locals accused the authority of attempting to start construction of the dam without proper consultations with the local community.
