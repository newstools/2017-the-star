Nominated Senator Janet Ong&rsquo;era has officially joined the Kisii county woman representative race. She is the eigth aspirant to declare her interest to unseat the incumbent Mary Otara.The aspirants are Brigid Ombati, Evelyn Ogendo, Isabella Mose, Judith Miruka, Linet Onsare, Norah Nyamwamu, Ong&rsquo;era, Otara and Vicky Onderi. Ong&rsquo;era and Otara both seek the ODM ticket.Political analysts say ODM may favour Ong&rsquo;era over Otara because the latter has not been at the forefront in championing party interests. The party says, however, it will not play favourites.&ldquo;I foresee a situation where Ong&rsquo;era will face an uphill task because she comes from the same constituency as Senator Chris Obure, who is seeking to unseat James Ongwae,&rdquo; Omato said.He said residents may not want to vote for two county leaders from the same constituency.
