Stiff political competition and the need to capture the presidency necessitated formation of the National Super Alliance, NASA. This new coalition brings together the four opposition co-principals: Raila Odinga (ODM), Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper), Musalia Mudavadi (ANC) and Moses Wetang'ula (Ford-Kenya).This united front will face the Jubilee Party spearheaded by President Uhuru Kenya, its flagbearer.Political coalitions coming together to form government have definite advantages.A coalition government in its structures represents the smallest and at times marginalised communities and gives them a stage to work and be represented in government.It also creates a mix of ideologies and ideals including economics, education, healthcare, foreign policy, capitalism, secularism, leftism and non-corruption. Thus, it is fertile soil for democracy.A united coalition checks monopolistic parties and individuals and breeds intellectualism and versatility in decision-making and policy formulation, generating all-round solutions.On the other hand, and based on the Kenyan context, the challenges of coalition governments outweigh the benefits.Such a government may be inefficient due to differences in opinion by the key principals. Decision-making can be protracted and delayed due to bureaucracy and unnecessary consultation.Analysis of Kenyan political parties demonstrates ineffectiveness and little consolidation of democratic principles and values.Parties are bedeviled ethnicity, personalisation and excessive focus on power rather than policy engagement and service.They are often overly manipulated to address short-term goals rather than inculcate enduring democratic culture.Party leaders are not committed to party ideology and are driven by a greed for power and control of resources.There is great mistrust among party leaders, no seriousness about ideologies and principles are often disregarded in pursuit of personal political interests.This renders political outfits &lsquo;parties for politicians&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;parties for politics&rsquo;.And so, when coalition governments are formed, these vices are replicated in coalition structures, rendering them ineffective and not beneficial to the people.An example is the coalition run by President Mwai Kibaki and Prime Minister Raila Odinga. Their coalition under the Narc government formed in 2002 faced daunting challenges.These included divergent orientations, maintaining party discipline, disagreements in public appointments, disregard for the Memorandum signed by coalescing parties and differences in policy and financial appropriation.Though coalitions have proved sustainable in democracies such as India, Germany, Italy and France, coalitions in Kenya are formed for all intents and purposes as unions of convenience. Jubilee and NASA are no exceptions.
