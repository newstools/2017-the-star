Bungoma Governor Kenneth Lusaka has said the August election will be a two-horse race between NASA and Jubilee. He said other parties are merely playing an escort role. Lusaka spoke on Monday in Nabingenge Secondary School, Tongaren constituency, where he launched a library and two classrooms built through the support of woman MP Reginalda Wanyonyi. Lusaka said Jubilee is ready to take on NASA. He said NASA is likely to break when its flagbearer is chosen. Lusaka said Bungoma has registered 50,066 new voters and he will ensure they are all kept intact for Jubilee. &lsquo;&rsquo;We want to plead with those who have registered that on the Election Day, ensure you vote early and go home to wait for results,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said.
