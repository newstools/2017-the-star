Businessman Bundotich Kiprop, popularly known as Buzeki, has denied claims he is being sponsored by Deputy President William Ruto to run against Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago.&ldquo;Mandago is not even my competitor. I am competing against the problems of the people of Uasin Gishu. Other people are also free to vie for the seat and let the people decide,&rdquo; he said.Bundotich spoke in Eldoret town on Friday last week. He said he has succeeded in business and can do the same in politics.During the funeral of former nominated MP Mark Too on January 9, Baringo Senator Gideon Moi said Bundotich is being sponsored.Bundotich said, &ldquo;No amount of propaganda will derail me from my ambition to lead Uasin Gishu.&rdquo;He accused Mandago of promoting tribal politics. Bundotich urged the Kalenjin Council of Elders not to allow themselves to be used by Mandago to promote tribalism. He told them to apologise for trying to block him and other aspirants from running because of subtribe politics. &ldquo;This subtribe agenda being pushed by the incumbent is just a one-man thinking. He is trying to make others buy into his narrow-minded agenda and that cannot work. I will always seek to extend my unity agenda to all people of Uasin Gishu,&rdquo; Bundotich said.Two weeks ago, the CoE proposed that political seats be shared out among constituencies. Led by John Seii, the elders had suggested the governor should come from Eldoret North constituency, the senator from Eldoret East and the woman representative from Eldoret South.This favours Mandago and locks out Buzeki who is from Eldoret East and former judiciary registrar Gladys Shollei - also in the race for governor - who also comes from the same region. Bundotich said elders should not control politics.
