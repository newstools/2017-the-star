Negotiations between doctors and the government were on the brink of collapse last night after doctors insisted that the entire CBA agreement be implemented.Sources said although both parties had agreed on most of the contentious issues, they disagreed on doctors salaries.Documents presented to the mediation committee show that doctors will pocket Sh33 billion in a single payout if their collective bargaining agreement is fully implemented and paid in arrears.In one memo, the calculations show each doctor will take home at least Sh6 million immediately the CBA is implemented.The amount is half the budget of the ministry of health, based on the 2016-2017 allocation.The figure is calculated from the arrears that would be paid to an intern, which is the difference between the current Sh140,000 minimum salary and the Sh325,000 that doctors are demanding.The difference of Sh185,000 is then multipled by 36 months to yield Sh6.66 million.&ldquo;That's an average calculation based on the lowest paid doctor. The figure will be higher because of specialists,&rdquo; a document presented to the mediation team by the ministry of health says.The ministry said it is still hopeful that the ongoing unrest will come to an end and service delivery in public health facilities, especially hospitals, restored.Kenya Medical Practitioners Pharmacists and Dentists Union chairperson Samuel Oroko, who was among the seven unionists jailed last week, said they will demand the full implementation of their CBA plus arrears."We will dictate the terms of negotiations in the ongoing doctor's negotiations, it is not our fault in years that the government has not been able to meet the doctor's demands and improve health care and services," Oroko said in a brief to all doctors."I want to make it clear that we want the CBA implemented in full and we will stop at nothing or settle for nothing less"Kenya has about 5,000 doctors working in public and mission hospitals, and other government institutions.Only the issue of salaries and allowances, and training of doctors remain unresolved in the strike, now on 80th day.Doctors are demanding close to 300 per cent pay hike, raising the salary of the lowest paid intern to Sh325,000 and nearly Sh1 million for consultants.&ldquo;To implement the CBA an additional 10.4bn needs to be factored in the budget every year,&rdquo; the ministry says.However, the government has offered a maximum salary of Sh208,000 for interns fresh from university.The doctors are also demanding a &ldquo;a doctors only&rdquo; medical research fund, but the ministry says there already exists bodies that are handling similar initiatives, including the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) and National Commission for Science, Technology and Innovation."Nevertheless, doctors employed by government are always prioritized for research fellowships including those offered by foreign countries through their development agencies working with the Ministry," the ministry said. It also explained it could not assure doctors of the 400 scholarships they want every year.The ministry's statement was unsigned. It however said such training depends on the availability of training positions at public universities."Being autonomous institutions, it is the prerogative of universities to offer residency. However, the Ministry can propose to enter Memoranda of Understanding with respective Universities with regard to opportunities for residency," said the statement.Doctors accuse the government of mishandling their strike and say it need not have lasted this long."It is unfortunate...it was never our intention... The strike has been mishandled. We are being frustrated at whatever cost and the issues we present are not important to them," KMPDU boss Ouma Oluga told the Senate Health committee two weeks ago.Oluga said the path they took was to allow the Health ministry to discuss their 2013 Collective Bargaining Agreement.But he told the committee that the ministry headed by Dr Cleopa Mailu "vehemently refused" to negotiate the deal.The secretary general said they submitted new proposals in June last year but did not get any feedback from Mailu and his team."The ministry did not want to bargain. If the ministry could deliberate on this we would take two or three days to return to work," he said.Oluga says they settled on the strike with a clear conscience but added that they considered other ways out of the CBA.The union boss said the doctors have not asked for anything but the agreement. He noted it took one and a half years of serious negotiations for the document to be signed in June 2013."We have always engaged based on the CBA. We are willing to compromise based on engagement on the CBA, not any other process," he said.
