Embu Senator Lenny Kivuti and other politicians who defected to Maendeleo Chap Chap have been cautioned against &ldquo;bringing the chaos you left in Jubilee to the party&rdquo;. Embu governor aspirant Leonard Muriuki, his advisers Njagagua Murage and Hussein Kinyua said they welcome Kivuti to Maendeleo Chap Chap, whose leader is Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua. They said the party values discipline, transparency, democracy, peace and tranquility. Muriuki said nominations will be free and fair. Mbeere North MP Charles Njagagua, Embu Deputy Governor Dorothy Nditi and 23 MCAs joined MCC on Saturday. Muriuki urged Kivuti to campaign peacefully. &ldquo;If Kivuti was running away from nominations when he quit Jubilee, he should expect to face the same exercise here,&rdquo; he said. The three were speaking in Embu town when Muriuki launched a football tournament and donated uniforms for the teams.
