Small parties in Nyanza and Western are banking on the defection of politicians from big parties to expand their membership.They are receiving defectors whom they plan to field in all positions, except the President post.There is fear of shambolic nominations in ODM, Ford Kenya, ANC and Jubilee Party.Some of the small parties to benefit from defections include the Federal Party of Kenya, the Citizens Conventions Party, the Farmers' Party, the Green Congress Party of Kenya, and the Movement for Democratic Growth.CCP leader Grace Akumu and Farmers' Party vice chairman George Weda said they will supporter ODM leader Raila Odinga for presidency.Akumu said her party is rooting for a national outlook and will welcome more members.This comes as Raila&rsquo;s ODM is focused to win majority of seats with some aspirants considering joining smaller parties to evade being locked out of the August election.Already, some ODM members have ditched the party for fear of shambolic primaries.Sources said ODM, JP and Ford Kenya elected leaders are quietly lobbying for tickets from other political parties to help them retain their seats.The lobbying started after the enactment of the law barring party-hopping after nominations. A number of aspirants have applied for nominations in smaller parties that did not sponsor them for election in 2013.Ugenya MP David Ochieng and former Rangwe MP Martin Ogindo ditched ODM for the MDG and GCK parties, respectively.Ochieng said he will defend his seat on MDG, a youth registered party, currently with 28 branch offices nationwide.He said he will support Raila as the presidential candidate.&ldquo;I ditched ODM because of divisive politics by some members,&rdquo; the MP said.Ogindo, while launch GCK party, said he will compete with Homa Bay Town MP Peter Kaluma for the post. He said his party will support Raila for President, but field candidates in all other positions.Sirisia MP John Waluke, an ODM sponsored MP, decamped to JP on which he plans to defend his seat.Labour Party leader Ababu Namwamba is also banking on defections to strengthen his party.Political analyst Jared Okello said smaller parties will give well-established parties stiff competition.More defections are expected as some aspirants and elected leaders are fearful they might be rigged out at the nominations, he said.Okello said defection will only be minimal if parties are able to conduct credible nominations which reflect the will of the people.&ldquo;For ODM party, the leadership has learnt from past mistakes and therefore we are unlikely to witness many defections,&rdquo; he said.In reference to the 2013 poll, Okello said ODM lost crucial seats to other parties because of poor nominations.He said Raila is determined on his fourth attempt on presidency and would not want trouble in his backyard, and therefore is keen to have credible primaries.The People&rsquo;s Democratic Party, the Progressive Party of Kenya, the Kenya Social Congress Party and the Kenya National Congress are also planning to sponsor candidates.They also expect to gain from defections to compete for various seats.South Mugirango MP Manson Nyamweya ditched ODM for the KSC party, on which he will use to run for Kisii governor.Kisii Deputy Governor Joash Maangi ditched ODM for Jubilee and intends to run for governor.ODM chairman John Mbadi said they are not shaken by the emergence of other political parties because Kenya is a democratic nation.Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi said the smaller parties cannot be compared with ODM.The two said assured aspirants that ODM will conduct credible nominations.
