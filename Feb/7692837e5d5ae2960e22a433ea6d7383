Private sector credit growth had already started falling at the end of 2015 after the central bank toughened supervision. It worsened from April when mid-sized lender Chase collapsed, the Purchasing Managers' Index indicated yesterday.Year-on-year credit growth was 4.3 per cent in December, compared to 17.8 per cent a year before, central bank said.But the central bank said the drop in credit growth had bottomed out, with growth hovering near the 4.3 per cent level for three months. Governor Patrick Njoroge forecast this week the economy would grow by 5.7 percent in 2017.Njoroge also said the impact of slower credit growth to firms had been factored in that growth forecast, in part because farming which accounts for a quarter of Kenya's $62 billion (Sh642.9 billion ) gross domestic product did not rely on credit."The areas where credit moves GDP much more is areas like trade and credit in trade is growing," he said.The government says the cap aimed to stop banks charging excessive rates on smaller businesses, but economists say smaller firms that are vital to create jobs cannot secure loans."It exerts a needless cost on the Kenyan economy, for very little gain, and further complicates any poverty alleviation effort," Razia Khan, head of Africa research at Standard Chartered in London, told Reuters.The International Monetary Fund said in a report on January 25, that Kenya's economic outlook was positive but rate controls were a drag."It is essential to remove these controls, while taking steps to prevent predatory lending and increase competition and transparency of the banking sector," it said.On Thursday, Britam Asset Managers said Kenya&rsquo;s economy is expected to grow at between five and 5.6 per cent in 2017, supported by increased government spending and resilient performance in transport, trade and tourism.However, unfavourable weather and subdued credit growth which underscores the soaring macro space will remain a risk to the country&rsquo;s growth.The government needs to grow its expenditure by the targeted 16.4 per cent this fiscal year and to achieve the expected 17.6 per cent increase in revenues, in order to meet the projected economic growth, Britam said.The government must, therefore, spend to sustain gross domestic product growth above 5.0 per cent in 2017.&ldquo;Kenya has one of the most dynamic and well-diversified economies in the Sub-Saharan African region, helping it weather many of the shocks that have beset the region. We expect GDP growth of five per cent &ndash; 5.6 per cent in 2017,&rdquo; Britam Asset Managers CEO Kenneth Kaniu said.
