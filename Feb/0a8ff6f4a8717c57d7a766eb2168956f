Plans to privatise or sell the New Kenya Co-operative Creameries have been put off by the government until further notice.Chief executive Nixon Sigei says the firm will remain a full parastatal, urging farmers to ignore rumours of an alleged plan by the government to sell the company.&ldquo;The president spoke about the status of the new KCC when he visited the North Rift region recently and what he said remains the position,&rdquo; Sigei said. He said farmers should not be worried as they will be involved in any plan affecting the future of the New KCC. Sigei said registration of farmers in Rift Valley who will be paid Sh500 million arrears is ongoing. The company owed them the dues before it collapsed in 1998, but it was revived by the government in 2003.A fortnight ago, controversial lawyer Simon Lilan said he had instructed his lawyers to file a case in court seeking to have the dairy company directly transferred to farmers, its original owners. &ldquo;I have learned that some people are secretly planning ways to grab the New KCC which is a company owned by farmers,&rdquo; Lilan said.But Sigei dismissed Lilan&rsquo;s claims, saying the New KCC is a government parastatal that cannot be taken over &ldquo;by some individuals secretly&rdquo;.During his tour of Nandi last month, President Uhuru Kenyatta said the New KCC will not be privatised, reassuring the farmers that they will be paid.Lilan is demanding that the money should be paid along with accrued interest. He said the government should have handed back the dairy firm to farmers after repossessing it from individuals who had taken over its operations during former President Moi&rsquo;s regime.He insists the firm is not the government&rsquo;s property. &ldquo;You cannot sell what does not belong to you. So there should be no question of privatisation,&rdquo; Lilan said.The CEO said about 90 per cent of the farmers owed money have been listed in some counties. &ldquo;The farmers have to produce evidence and once it&rsquo;s confirmed and the process completed, the farmers will be paid,&rdquo; Sigei said.
