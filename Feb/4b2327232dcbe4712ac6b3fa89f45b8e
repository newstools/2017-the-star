Auditor General Edward Ouko may not be off the hook yet over irregular acquisition of the Sh100 million audit vault software until the National Assembly dispenses with a petition seeking his removal.This comes as Director of Public Prosecutions Keriako Tobiko cleared Ouko of the charges that included abuse of office, failure to comply with procurement laws and engaging in the project without planning.The grounds for the removal from office of the Auditor General are based on a report by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission that recommended his prosecution, a fact National Assembly clerk Michael Sialai recognised, saying it may have implications for the petition&rsquo;s progression.He said the House legal department is scrutinising petition allegations filed by the International Policy Group to determine whether they meet the requirements before the speaker makes his pronouncement.&ldquo;The Standing Orders are clear that the petition must raise substantive grounds on the claims made,&rdquo; Sialai said yesterday, adding that, &ldquo;The Speaker will be advised based on what the legal department will recommend.&rdquo; Among the claims raised in the petition is that the DPP had taken too long to act on the EACC file, a ground that may change the flow of the petition.The top executive management committee at the office of the Auditor General has agreed not to extend the contract of Deputy Auditor General John Kagondu.Claims have been abound that Kagondu, who turns 60 in a few months and whose contract is expected to end this month, was being groomed to replace Ouko in an acting capacity should the DPP have proceeded to prosecute him.However, the Star has established that the executive management committee meeting chaired by Ouko met on Thursday and made the decision, given the tension, divisions and crisis at the office.&ldquo;So as not to give credence to the alleged plot that he was being groomed to succeed the auditor general, the committee thought it wise not to renew his contract,&rdquo; a source told the Star. The Star has also established Kagondu expressed his willingness to leave just before the meeting was held and that the auditor general has been a subject of a &ldquo;wild goose chase&rdquo; and a &ldquo;gangsterism&rdquo; target by those not impressed by his recent audit revelations, including the impending outcome on the Sh250 billion Eurobond scandal.
