A human rights activist in Baringo has appealed to the Kenya Red Cross Society to rescind its decision to suspend all operations due to harassment, attacks on convoys and looting.The Red Cross suspended operations last Saturday.Activist Amos Olempaka said more than 30,000 people in the region are in dire need of humanitarian assistance and the decision by the Red Cross would expose them to more suffering and even death.&ldquo;We are pleading with the Red Cross to revoke its decision lest we lose our people to hunger. We have more than 10,000 people in camps, especially women and children and we can only rely on the Red Cross to assist them,&rdquo; Olempka said.He said that due to violence thousands of displaced people are living in camps in Baringo North and they urgently require blankets, water, medicine and food.He said the government should provide adequate security to Red Cross staff, and give clear orders to security personnel to end the violence.&ldquo;We have so many security teams deployed in Baringo but its seems their operations are not well coordinated,&rdquo; Olempaka said.The Red Cross said it took the decision after attacks, harassment and looting of supplies for Turkana on Friday at Kambi Samaki. &ldquo;It is with a heavy heart that the Kenya Red Cross Society announces suspension of its activities in Baringo county, as we can no longer guarantee the safety of our staff, volunteers and resources,&rdquo; the Red Cross said in a statement.
