Lamu residents in areas prone to wildlife attacks should kill the animals, Hongwe MCA James Komu has said.On Sunday, he accused the KWS of being unable to contain wildlife, which terrorises residents as they search for water and food as the drought persists.&ldquo;Wild animals, especially hippos and buffaloes, have been loitering allover the place. They are now entering homes and killing people. We are telling people to take up their weapons and defend themselves from these animals, after all there is no one else to do it for us,&rdquo; Komu said.Elsewhere, residents of Hindi have issued a 48-hour ultimatum to the KWS to deal with the wildlife menace, failing which they said they will start killing the animals.
