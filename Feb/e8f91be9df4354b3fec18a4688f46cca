Egypt has praised US President Donald Trump's criticism of Western media for what he said was their limited coverage of some militant attacks around the world."The Foreign Ministry hailed the US administration stance in this regard, referring to Egypt's repeated calls upon the international community to adopt a comprehensive, coordinated and non-selective strategy to combat terrorism at all levels; security, political, cultural, media and others," the statement said. Trump accused the media of under-reporting terror attacks, and produced a list to back up his claim. Is he right?While on a visit to US Central Command, a wing of the Department of Defense, he warned of the danger posed by the Islamic State group."You have seen what happened in Paris and Nice. All over Europe it's happening," he said."It's gotten to a point where it's not even being reported. And in many cases the very, very dishonest press doesn't want to report it."They have their reasons, and you understand that."Later in the day, the White House published a list of attacks "executed or inspired" by IS. Before the list was published, press secretary Sean Spicer said there were "several instances" of attacks that had not gained sufficient media coverage (without specifying which fell into that category).BBC reproduced the list and explained what happened in each case and whether it reported on it.Just because the BBC covered an attack does not mean that incident was not under-reported, although it is unclear whether Trump was referring to US or global news organisations.Some terrorist incidents do get more coverage than others, a point hotly debated on social media.Most of the atrocities listed by the White House were committed by religious extremists, and the killing of nine black worshippers by a self-avowed white supremacist in South Carolina is notably absent.Absent too is the 2016 bombing of a shopping centre in Baghdad that killed some 300 people, and last week's deadly assault on a mosque in Quebec City.Read the full story on BBC
