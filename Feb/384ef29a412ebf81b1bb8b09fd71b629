Former Mt Elgon MP Fred Kapondi has recorded statements over remarks he made implying he might recruit young men to cause violence.Speaking to the Star yesterday on the phone, Mt Elgon regional commissioner Stephen Momanyi said the statements have been forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions.&ldquo;Police have already recorded his statements and investigations over his conduct are being carried out,&rdquo; he saidThis is after the ex-lawmaker was captured on tape issuing threats against his opponents at a funeral.Kapondi in a video that has gone viral on social media, warned his critics of dire consequences after the crowd booed him two weeks ago.Trouble started at the funeral in Cheptais, after parliamentary aspirant Evans Kiprotich claimed Kapondi occupied land that was purchased using the CDF cash when he was in office."Kama ni kupanga vijana, hakuna mtu anajua kupanga kushinda mimi. Na nikiamua kupanga mtajikolea (If it is planning with young men, no one who knows how to do it better than me. If I decide to do so, you people will urinate on yourselves," Kapondi is heard saying on the video.Mt Elgon MP John Serut and his Sirisia counterpart John Waluke were present at the funeral.Yesterday, Kiprotich told the Star he will seek the help from the National Cohesion and Integration Commission to bring Kapondi to book."We are giving police one week to take action against Kapondi. If they don't, we shall go to the NCIC for help," he said.The Sabaot Land Defence Force militia caused havoc between 2008 and 2009, causing the death of more than 1,200 people and 10,000 displaced.Many people were arrested and charged, including Kapondi.The group was crushed through a joint military and police operation in 2009.In the past two weeks on diverse dates, three people have been killed in the area in the same style the militia used during the days they caused mayhem.
