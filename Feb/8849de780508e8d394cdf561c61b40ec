The Kenya Vision 2030 Delivery Secretariat has come out to encourage Kenyans to register in large numbers to vote for results-oriented leaders. Director general Julius Muia yesterday said Kenya will only achieve Vision 2030 if there is political goodwill from a sitting government. He said the delivery of the blueprint is well on course and ahead of schedule because of many ongoing flagship projects. Muia cited the standard gauge railway, construction of the Dongo-Kundu bypass that connects the west and south of Mombasa and expansion of the Port of Mombasa. He, however, expressed concern over voter apathy,saying the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission might not meet its target. The IEBC targets at least six million Kenyans, but only 2.1 million have registered. Many Kenyans have shied away, saying they do not see the benefits of participating in political affairs. Muia said, &ldquo;For Kenya to continue growing, every person has to participate in voting for the right people.&rdquo;
