Political rivalry between various leaders in Nyanza and Western is expected to resume after the countrywide mass voter registration ended yesterday.Listing began on January 16.Some leaders embroiled in political wrangles put aside their differences to campaign for voter registration.In Kisumu county, for instance, governor aspirants Anyang&rsquo; Nyong&rsquo;o (senator) and Hezron McObewa put aside their campaigns and differences with incumbent Jack Ranguma to spearhead voter listing.This, however, did not last long as Nyong&rsquo;o, Nyando MP Fred Outa and Deputy Governor Ruth Odinga, also gunning for governor, accused Ranguma of sabotaging voter listing.Previously, Nyong&rsquo;o has been involved in a political spat with the governor, accusing him of mismanaging county resources.The Kisumu senator and McObewa have strongly criticised Ranguma&rsquo;s leadership, alleging poor governance and runaway corruption in the county.At one point, Nyong&rsquo;o apologised to Kisumu residents for making Ranguma the governor, claiming he has failed to develop the county.In Siaya, governor aspirants seeking to unseat incumbent Cornel Rasanga were separately mobilising residents to register to vote, despite calls by Cord leader Raila Odinga that leaders work together in spearheading the process.Those vying against Rasanga include Senator James Orengo, Rarieda MP Nicholas Gumbo, William Oduol and Carey Orege.Attempts by the incumbent to bring the leaders together to strategise on voter listing were thwarted, as most of his opponents skipped the meeting.In Homa Bay county, Kasipul MP Oyugi Magwanga and rival Governor Cyprian Awiti put aside their differences to champion for voter registration.Magwanga, a strong critic of Awiti, wants to run for governor.Earlier, he said, &ldquo;Reelecting the incumbent will be a disaster. Despite the county receiving Sh25 billion since devolution started, there is still nothing to show. Even the basics such as addressing the water shortage.&rdquo;Other aspirants include ex-National Intelligence Service Finance boss Sammy Wakiaga, Technical University of Kenya administrator Ochieng&rsquo; Kanyadudi and Enosh Bolo, a management consultant and strategy expert.In Kakamega, the rivalry between Governor Wycliffe Oparanya and Senator Boni Khalwale, who wants to be county boss, has fuelled an acrimonious relationship between the two.Khalwale has accused the governor of poor governance and mismanagement of public resources.In Busia, the same trend could be witnessed between incumbent Sospeter Ojaamong and Funyula MP Paul Otuoma, a fierce critic of the county boss. Otuoma wants to be governor.The two leaders met when Raila visited the area for a voter listing drive.
