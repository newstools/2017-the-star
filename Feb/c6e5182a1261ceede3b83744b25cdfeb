Religious leaders from lower eastern have said they will actively campaign against politicians who fuel violence. Speaking when they met elected leaders and aspirants at a Machakos hotel on Saturday, the clerics urged the politicians to ensure peaceful campaigns. National Council of Churches of Kenya deputy chairman Archbishop Timothy Ndambuki said they will organise seminars and rallies to promote peace. &ldquo;This time round, religious leaders will not sit back and watch as things happen. Through our churches and mosques, we will carry out civic education to ensure our people make informed choices,&rdquo; he said. Ndambuki urged all political sides to be prepared to accept the outcome of the August 8 election. If they are dissatisfied, they should challenge the results in court, instead of fanning chaos, he said. Ndambuki said 2007-08 PEV is a frightening example of something that should never be repeated. &ldquo;Our hope is to see Kenyans resume their normal life, regardless of which faction loses or wins on August 8,&rdquo; Ndambuki said. He urged the judiciary to handle justly any election petition that may arise. Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana, who attended the forum, praised the clerics and said the church. He said the church is an integral part of the society. Kibwana said it is time the country organises its politics to achieve development.
