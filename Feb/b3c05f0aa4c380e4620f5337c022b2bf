Kilifi woman representative Aisha Jumwa has accused county self-proclaimed ODM chief campaigner of being a Jubilee mole. She said Nominated MCA Anderson Ngombo is being funded by the Jubilee Party to spoil votes. Jumwa said if action is not taken, Ngombo will cause serious negative repercussions for ODM in the general election.Speaking in Malindi on Tuesday, Jumwa said she has evidence Ngombo is also funded to tarnish her image because she is eyeing the Malindi MP seat.&ldquo;We know Jubilee is funding him to spoil ODM votes and Jumwa in particular. I will fight and prevent anyone who has ill intention against ODM,&rsquo;&rsquo; she said.But Ngombo dismissed the allegations, saying he is an ODM diehard and he will not leave the party.He said Jumwa is the only person known to have served different parties before joining ODM.Ngombo said it is him and Kilifi Senator Stewart Madzayo who helped her during her campaigns.&ldquo;I am not a Jubilee mole. Even the ODM officials know I cannot work with Jubilee," he said.Jumwa and Ngombo broke ranks after the latter declared his support for Malindi MP Willy Mtengo.Ngombo, a close ally of Governor Amason Kingi, said he became ODM chief campaigner after campaigning for Kingi.&ldquo;I was first the chief campaigner of Kingi in Magarini constituency until he won the elections and became MP. When he declared he would vie for governor, I rose to the rank of county chief campaigner and everyone knows it," he said.Jumwa urged Kingi to take action against Ngombo.
