The Environment ministry is concerned with the conflict in Laikipia pitting ranch owners against illegal herders.Director of wildlife conservation Stephen Manengene yesterday said even though no wildlife have been killed, many have been displaced.&ldquo;The Laikipia matter is complex as people from Samburu and Baringo are bringing their livestock in search of water and pasture,&rdquo; he said.Manegene said herders believe lawlessness is an opportunity to reclaim ancestral land.The conflict is believed to have been fuelled by the scramble for pasture and water due to drought, availability of illegal weapons and politics, which area leaders deny.An estimated 10,000 pastoralists with 135,000 cattle have invaded ranches in Laikipia North in four months.The herders, composed mainly of morans, have been accused of indiscriminately shooting at wildlife as they attempt to scare them off, especially at water points.There have been fears that criminals interested in poaching might take advantage of the ongoing invasions in Laikipia.Manegene said the matter has attracted the attention of the President and Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery.However, Laikipia Farmers Association last week said the government has not done enough to control the situation.But Interior ministry spokesperson Mwenda Njoka dismissed the association, saying a lot has been done.&ldquo;There are socio-economic issues in the conflict. The Inspector General of Police was on the ground to access the situation on Monday, where he met with the troops,&rdquo; Njoka said on the phone.He added that there is a lot of security personnel composed of Rapid Deployment Unit, Administration Police and the Anti-Stock Theft Unit.
