The late William ole Ntimama&rsquo;s daughter Lydia Masikonte is among politicians who have defected to Governor Isaac Rutto's Chama Cha Mashinani party.Masikonte who defected alongside eight Narok MCAs said she settled on CCM as the party shared her ideas."My late father held my hands and took me to Jubilee Party. But they have proven that they already have their preferred candidate," she said on Monday."My manifesto is to ensure that the devolved system of governance is strengthened and we found that CCM is the only party fighting for the devolving of resources to the counties," she added.Masikonte made good her threat to leave Jubilee after raising concern over the credibility of party nominations.Prior to his death, Ntimama had led a Maa community delegation to State House. The leaders pledged to support President Uhuru Kenyatta's re-election in the August 8 polls.This information was countered by opposition leader Raila Odinga who claimed Ntimama called him after the State House meeting to assure him he was still in ODM.During the Monday event, Masikonte was welcomed by Rutto in an event attended by Kanu's Gideon Moi (chair) and John Lonyangapuo (secretary general).[VIDEO] Ntimama to be buried with ODM flag, says RailaRead: Maasai to remain in Jubilee as Ntimama wished, says NkaisseryMCAs also received by Rutto are Narok Stephen Kudate (Naroosura), Bob Maren (Ololulunga), James Kiok (Nkareta), and Francis Rono (Kapsasian).Others were Joseph Barusei (Ilmotiok), Nenkai Karkar (nominated &ndash; Jubilee ), Mercy Keiwa (nominated &ndash; KNC), and Jackson Kapei (nominated &ndash; Jubilee).Narok West MP Patrick Ntutu also officially joined CCM from Jubilee Party and announced his bid for Narok governor.The former ODM Narok County chairman Jackson Kamoye is another politician who defected to Rutto's party.The move comes at a time when Narok North MP Moitalel ole Kenta defected to ODM from Jubilee three weeks ago.
