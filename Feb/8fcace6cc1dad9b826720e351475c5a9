Kisii Senator Chris Obure wants Governor James Ongwae to step in and address the county&rsquo;s striking health workers. Addressing the press at Parliament Buildings, Obure criticised the governor for his poor response, three days since the workers downed their tools. Obure accused Ongwae&rsquo;s administration of not giving employees a chance to air their grievances.The workers went on strike on Monday over poor working conditions and salary demands. They have been camping outside the governor&rsquo;s office seeking audience.&ldquo;Surely this is a shame! The health workers deserve an audience with the governor, even if he may not be in a position to make the changes they are calling for,&rdquo; Obure said.He said it is ridiculous and irresponsible on the part of the governor and his government to &ldquo;treat citizens in this manner - let alone staff of the county government.&rdquo;
