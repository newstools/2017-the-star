The High Court has rejected a bid by a father and his son seeking to stop the Director of Public Prosecutions from probing their construction company.Justice Edward Murithi said Shivji Jadva Parbat and Paresh Shivi Jadva did not prove that their rights were being violated.He also faulted the two businessmen for failing to disclose to the court that they had been charged with a criminal offence.The two are also restrained from transferring or disposing of properties of the company.In the case, complainants Vinod Varsani, Kunverji Varsani and Shivji Pindula said that when their father died, the two men forged documents and transferred shares without lawful authority.However, Parbat and Paresh, the directors of Mistry Jadva Parbat &amp; Co limited, argued that the basis for investigations was made by three complainants who have no relation to the company.They had told the judge that the planned probe into their accounts at Middle East Bank had no basis and was in breach of their constitutional rights.The DPP argued Parbat and Paresh applied to stop the probe with the aim of defeating the cause of justice and interfering with his mandate. Justice Muriithi said, &ldquo;Without prejudice to the finding of the criminal court in the pending criminal trial and any subsequent charges preferred against the petitioners upon investigations, I consider that the respondents and the interested parties have demonstrated a reasonable ground for the suspicion of the petitioners as having committed the offence of forgery and fraud.&rdquo;The judge, however, said the status quo be maintained and allowed the two to remain legal owners of the shares and to continue operating the bank accounts.The judge directed the police to only use the documents for purpose of the criminal investigations and prosecution of the case. He said they should not be shared with third parties.
