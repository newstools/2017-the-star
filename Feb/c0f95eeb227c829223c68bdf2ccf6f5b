Othaya MP Mary Wambui has denied reports she is involved in drug trafficking.An article in the Sunday Standard newspaper listed her as one of the people linked to drug trafficking in a 2010 report by the US Embassy.On Tuesday, Wambui said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a God-fearing woman who cannot do such things. Let me not comment further.&rdquo; She spoke in Kagicha, Othaya constituency, after disbursing CDF funds to community groups. Wambui later toured the four wards in Othaya and disbursed Sh22.6 million to local women&rsquo;s groups.She also urged residents to register to vote before the mass listing drive ends next Tuesday.It was reported that the US has renewed the push against Kenyan drug lords and turned the spotlight on prominent citizens previously accused of links to the narcotics trade.A week after the Akasha brothers were extradited to New York, investigators were reported to be looking afresh at the files of Kenyan big names cited in the embassy report.The report, which was handed to then Internal Security minister George Saitoti, not only triggered high-level investigations into the Akasha brothers - who are now awaiting trial - but also listed well-known Kenyans who have risen to powerful positions.They include Kiambu Governor William Kabogo, Mombasa&rsquo;s Hassan Joho, Senator Mike Sonko, former Assistant minister Harun Mwau and former Kamukunji MP Simon Mbugua.
