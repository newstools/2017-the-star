Wiper wants President Uhuru Kenyatta to withdraw KDF soldiers from Somalia. Secretary general Omar Hassan yesterday said it is untenable for KDF to continue staying in the neighbouring country. He said Somalia has had successful transitions after three elections and Kenya should learn her. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve seen two elections rigged in Kenya, while Somalia has held several credible elections and enjoyed peaceful transitions,&rdquo; Omar said during the party&rsquo;s NEC meeting in Nairobi. &ldquo;The President is taking for granted patriotic citizens who are out there to protect and defend their nation,&rdquo; he said. The Mombasa senator accused Uhuru of not listening to Kenyans when developing policies. Omar blamed this for poor services in the public sector, which he said have created room for theft of public funds. &ldquo;KDF is in Somalia for commercial reasons. A few people are making money,&rdquo; Omar said. He said the government has failed to give Kenyans information on attacks in Somalia. &ldquo;Kenyans want to know what is happening.&rdquo;
