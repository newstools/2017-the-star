Dagoretti North residents have urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to visit the area.The President cancelled a tour to the area last Sunday. Jubilee MP aspirant Carnicious Meso said residents had on Sunday prepared to receive the President and they were disappointed when he failed to go. "We are the true residents of Dagoretti North. There are others who purport to be representatives of the community living here, but are only lying," Meso said on Tuesday. He said that Luhyas in Jubilee want to feel included in the party.Meso said it will be unfair to give the ticket to nominated Senator Beatrice Elachi, whom he said does not originate from Western and "cannot represent the people of Dagoreti North and Kawangware fairly"."We want the President to come and assure us that the Jubilee ticket will not be dished out to Elachi just because of her position," he said.Simba Arati is the current Dagoretti North MP.
