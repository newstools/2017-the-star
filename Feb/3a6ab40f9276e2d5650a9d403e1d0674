Confusion is threatening to mar Jubilee&rsquo;s rally in Mombasa set to be addressed by Deputy President William Ruto on Sunday evening.The event, labelled as a Mass Voter Registration Rally, was first set to be held at Mvita grounds within Mvita constituency at 2pm.Jubilee members and supporters were invited via text messages to the rally.The text seemed to have come from the Anania Mwaboza wing of the Mombasa Jubilee brigade as it was signed by a K. Weni on behalf of Mwaboza.But shortly after, another set of text messages was sent saying the venue has been changed to Changamwe Social Hall in Changamwe constituency.A spot check revealed that both venues had already been prepared for the meeting, with tents erected and Jubilee colours on display.&ldquo;[Chamgamwe] is however not the most appropriate place to hold the meeting,&rdquo; Jubilee&rsquo;s Ali Mwatsahu told the Star on Sunday.Mwatsahu said the meeting ideally should be held in Kisauni constituency, where he said there are the highest number of registered voters.&ldquo;Kisauni has the highest population and the highest number of registered voters. That is the place to take such an important meeting. Let the people of Kisauni also feel appreciated and loved by Jubilee,&rdquo; said Mwatsahu, who is allied to Mwaboza.Read: Support Jubilee&rsquo;s reelection, Ruto urges coastal residentsBut Matano Chengo maintained that the meeting will be held in Changamwe at 4pm.&ldquo;The problem with Mombasa is that everyone knows, even those who are not involved. They are know-it-all people,&rdquo; said Chengo on phone.&ldquo;The meeting will be in Changamwe Social hall. The DP will be having lunch at Voyager Beach Hotel and later proceed to the venue at around 3pm,&rdquo; said Chengo, who is allied to Mombasa governor aspirant Suleiman Shahbal.&ldquo;He will be accompanied by leaders from Kilifi and Kwale counties led by the Shahbal,&rdquo; said Chengo.The Deputy President has been on a five-day tour of the Coast to mobilise and sensitise voters as the mass exercise enters its final leg.More on this: Ruto roasts Opposition at start of Coast tour, says it is time to ignore liars
