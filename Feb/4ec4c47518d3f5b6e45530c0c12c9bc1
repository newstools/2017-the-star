Kitui MCAs are being used by outsiders to sabotage the recruitment of elders for the 247 villages, Governor Julius Malombe has said.&ldquo;Outside powers think the elders can campaign for sitting MCAs and the incumbent governor. Outsiders have infiltrated the place and are trying to control the county assembly&rsquo;s agenda,&rdquo; he said.Malombe spoke in Nairobi on Monday during the first day of the annual consultative meeting between the Kitui executive and assembly. Speaker George Ndotto was present.Malombe said the assembly has refused to approve the hiring of the elders five weeks after receiving a memo.&ldquo;I urged the assembly not to allow itself to be controlled by outsiders. I have been taken aback by the development,&rdquo; he said.Ngomeni MCA Nzungi Ngwelle backed Malombe, saying some representatives are being used.He cited MCAs&rsquo; failure to approve the Public Service Board secretary. &ldquo;Puppet masters are busy at work,&rdquo; Ngwelle said.Ndotto said the delay is not deliberate.He said the assembly wants to seek legal advice first to ensure it follows the law.&ldquo;We do not want to do anything illegal and find ourselves on the wrong side of the law. We want to do things the right way so we don&rsquo;t end up in court,&rdquo; Ndotto said.He urged the Public Service Board to develop regulations on the hiring of the administrators and present them to the assembly.&ldquo;If this is done, the members will be approved. The assembly is not sabotaging recruitment,&rdquo; Ndotto said.Elders help coordinate, manage and supervise the general functions in the village, including participation in governance.They also help develop administrative capacity.
