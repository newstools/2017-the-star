Poor former MPs who have been, hovering about Parliament for handouts, have every reason to smile after a key House panel recommended that they receive Sh100,000 monthly pension.They will receive the money for their lifetime.The Finance and Planning Committee wants the 370 former lawmakers who served between 1984-2002 paid a total of Sh8.4 million as accumulated pension from July 2010.Read: Bid to give Sh100,000 monthly pension to former MPsThe pension has been calculated from 2010 because that is the time Parliament debated and approved the Akiwumi report which recommended the monthly pension.This means taxpayers will be forced to cough a staggering Sh3.1 billion as pension for former lawmakers living miserable lives..The current monthly pension for MPs who served between 1984 and 2002 is between Sh2,700 and Sh40,000.The Committee observed that the current pension for the MPs largely mismatched their general economic circumstances.The number of former MPs who served during the period was estimated to be 500 but others have died, lowering the number to 370.Read: Ex-MPs want pensionParliament will have to budget for Sh37 million monthly, going forward, as stipend for the MPs.The recommendations by the committee followed a public petition on implementation of the 2009 Akiwumi tribunal report on minimum living pension for former MPs.The tribunal was appointed by Parliament on January 2009 to review terms and conditions of service for MPs and Staff of the National Assembly.Parliament debated and adopted the report on June 30, 2010 but its implementation has been pending for seven years.Read: Taxpayers to incur Sh37 million monthly for former MPs pensionFollowing the delay in the implementation of the crucial report, the former Parliamentarians Association of Kenya (Fopak) petitioned Parliament to have the recommendations effected.Their petition was presented by Rarienda MP Nicholas Gumbo in October last year.To give legal effect to the payout, the panel chaired by Ainamoi MP Benjamin Langat has proposed amendments to the Parliamentary Pensions Act, Cap 196."Notwithstanding subsection (2), a former MP who, having served in Parliament between the year 1984 and 2002 is entitled to pension under this section, and whose monthly pension amounts to less than Sh100,000, shall be entitled to, with effect from July 1, 2010, to a monthly pension of Sh100,000," reads the proposed amendment.The committee wants the National Treasury to avail funds to pay the former MPs within the 2017/18 financial year.
