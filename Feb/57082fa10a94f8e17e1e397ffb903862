Sirisia MP John Waluke (pictured) yesterday denied claims he is ferrying Ugandan citizens to register as voters in his constituency.The allegation was made by ODM MP hopeful Moses Nandalwe. Waluke termed it baseless. He spoke when he met Jubilee aspirants in a Bungoma hotel. Waluke accused Nandalwe of pursuing cheap media publicity, adding he is unpopular and is a known perennial loser.&ldquo;It is unfortunate that such statements are coming from the likes of Nandalwe, who, in the last election, only managed 36 votes. He is a nobody as far Sirisia politics is concerned,&rdquo; he said.Nandalwe had said he had evidence about the claim. Sirisia constituency borders eastern Uganda. Many residents have relatives in the neighbouring country.Waluke said only people who have Kenyan national identity cards are being registered as voters in Sirisia. He said Nandalwe hardly travels in the constituency and doesn&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s happening. Instead, he campaigns only on social media, Waluke said.&ldquo;How can one Nandalwe purport to know what is going on in Sirisia, yet he stays in Nairobi and only communicates through social media,&rdquo; he said.Waluke urged Nandalwe to visit residents and ask for votes, instead of engaging in theatrics to get media attention.This comes barely a day after Teso South Mary Emase escaped police arrest in Uganda. Her bodyguard was arrested for trying to give Ugandans Kenyan ID cards to come and register as voters.The IEBC has denied the possibility of Ugandan citizens registering to vote in the August 8 polls.Speaking on the phone, the Upper Western region IEBC coordinator said his officers are using proper procedures.
