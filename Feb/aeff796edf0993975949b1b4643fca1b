The teachers went on strike seeking a pay rise. The witness said the words by Muthama on September 23 were meant to cause harm to the public. Muchai who was at the time attached to Langata police station, told trial magistrate Francis Andayi that he had been deployed in Uhuru Park on the day to maintain law and order.
