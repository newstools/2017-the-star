The Kenya Defence Forces did not lose anything significant in the semi-derelict building partly destroyed by a fire at the Department of Defence headquarters, Nairobi, yesterday. KDF spokesman Colonel David Obonyo said the building is used to store used items, pending disposal.  No one was injured in the fire.  Obonyo said the store structure houses mostly old tyres and used papers. "It is an old structure at the end of the compound. There was nothing of value to KDF in it. It is used to keep stuff awaiting the disposal procedures. Even if you asked the Nairobi fire brigade, they will tell you most of what was in the structure were old tyres," Obonyo said told the Star on the phone. He said the fire was noticed at 5.30am and the Nairobi fire fighters were called in to help the KDF personnel put it out.  The fire was put out by 7am.  Obonyo said they suspect the fire was caused by an electric fault. He said, however, investigations are going on to establish the cause.  KDF officers were seen manning the scene near Argwings Kodhek Road past midday.
