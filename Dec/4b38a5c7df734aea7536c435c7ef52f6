American singer Ty Dolla Sign and South Africa's Nasty C were in the country last weekend, where they brought Nairobi to a standstill at this year's Jameson Connects held at the Uhuru Gardens. Talking to the press, Nasty revealed that he is about to drop a collabo with Kenya's very own Camp Mulla. "I met with Camp Mulla the last time I was here, we're definitely gonna work together." Ty on the other hand is excited about his album, which was launched about a week ago. "It's one of my favourite projects, shout out to everybody that bought it or has been streaming it. I'll be performing some of the songs." Talking about his hit song Particular, Nasty said he enjoyed working with international act Jidenna. "It was so dope, everything feels so genuine because he's just like a cool guy, he'll never make you feel like you are a small guy. Shooting with him felt like somebody I've known for like sometime, when it wasn't." The two were saddened by the slavery in Libya. "If there was something I could do, I'd definitely do it, like aside from posting on social media," Nasty C said. Ty added, "Raising awareness on my platform is definitely a good thing. We should raise awareness and make sure everybody knows what is going on. It's up to us, let's stick together to change the world." The American singer explained why he has worked with Wizkid in a
couple of projects, being the only African he has worked with. "He's just a real one, I met him with Chris brown, and he's just one of the realest people I've ever known in the industry," Ty said. And they only had one sentence as a peace message for Kenya." "Violence is not the way to go. Let's stick to positive energy."
