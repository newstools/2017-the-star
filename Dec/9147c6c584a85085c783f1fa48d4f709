The Garissa Water and Sewerage Company is on course to end the water crisis in Garissa town. Speaking in Garissa town, Water executive Issa Dubow said ongoing water rehabilitation works will improve supply. He said changes like reshuffling the company’s top management will end the crisis. The company has a new MD, Yussuf Futol. In his manifesto, Garissa Governor Ali Korane promised to restore water services in the town in his first 100 days in office. Dubow said the water company will open four zonal offices in Waberi, Iftin, Galbet and Garissa Township with technical and complain response teams to ease congestion at the head office. “The management which is supposed to deal with policy issues and ways to improve critical services are using most of their time solving problems meant for technical staff,” the executive said. Dubow said the offices will be operational from January. It will deal with registration of new connections, updating the register and addressing other complaints from customers.
