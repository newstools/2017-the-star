Forty teachers were involved in KCSE exam irregularities and must be punished, TSC boss Nancy Macharia has said. Speaking during the release of exams at Nairobi School on Wednesday, Macharia said the teachers will be de-registered. "If they are found capable, we will deregister them and make sure they don't set foot on public or private schools," she said. Macharia also put private schools on notice saying they will be de-registered for abetting cheating in exams. "Private school will also be de-registered for trying to cheat. This is to ensure quality education," she said. She said proprietors who will be found engaging the de-registered teachers will also face the law. "As we put on notice teachers we are telling proprietors of our private schools that should they engage any deregistered teachers there is a law against this and they can be sued in court," she said. "When going on quality assurance if any is found guilty we are asking the ministry to deregister such schools." Macharia said  there will be sanctions on those who do not follow the stipulated regulations.  Education CS Fred Matiang'i will release the exams shortly at Nairobi School. This year, 615,773 candidates sat KCSE exam in 9,350 centres, a five per cent increase from last year’s 577,253 candidates. Of this year's candidates, 1,404 were special needs students.
