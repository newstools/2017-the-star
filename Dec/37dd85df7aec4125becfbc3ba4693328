Police in
Iten, Elgeyo Marakwet county are holding two French nationals found in
possession of bhang of unknown value in a hotel.
 Rondel Florent, 43, and Tllie Ayun, 19, who identified themselves as athletes, were apprehended on Thursday
evening at Kilima Resort near Kamariny stadium. Keiyo North
police boss Mwenda Meme on Saturday said they received a tip-off from members of the public who discovered the two had the banned substances. He said
police raided the hotel and interrogated the two men who turned violent during
questioning, prompting a search. "They were
interrogated and could not explain what they were doing in the hotel. Police officers
searched them and recovered bhang in their pockets," Meme said. "When our officers arrived they found the suspects smoking illegal
substance outside the hotel. The Frenchmen turned violent."  Meme said it
said foreign drug peddlers may be visiting the high altitude training
area in the pretext of training athletes only to engage in illegal
trade.  "Criminals
look for areas where they can not be suspected. They mix with athletes, making
it difficult to detect them," he added. He urged
residents to inform the police when they spot foreigners exhibiting suspicious behaviours. The police
boss further called on locals to monitor their children to stop them from
accessing illicit substances from drug peddlers. He said
investigations will establish whether the two suspects are athletes as they
claimed, or drug peddlers posing as sportsmen. The arrest
came three weeks after parents raised concern over raising cases of bhang
smoking among teenagers in Iten. Click here for the latest political news
