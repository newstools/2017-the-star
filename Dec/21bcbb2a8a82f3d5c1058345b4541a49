Some 2,000 boys will be
circumcised for free in a programme initiated by the Murang’a government.
 The programme, which started on Sunday,
targets boys from disadvantaged families who cannot afford to pay private facilities. Governor Mwangi wa Iria yesterday said the initiative
is part of a youth mentorship programme started in
2013. The programme guides young boys as they transition into
adulthood. Speaking at his office, Iria said the county has partnered
with local churches and elders to implement the nine-day programme in 13 centres. The county started the initiative
to stop criminals from initiating boys from poor families into
crime. “That is
how young men used to be introduced into crime and drug abuse, and their lives
destroyed at a tender age,” Iria said. He said the mentorship programme will go a long way into turning boys, especially from single parent
families, into responsible adults. Iria attributed the rise of illegal
gangs such as the Mungiki sect, which wreaked havoc in the county a few years ago,
to the lack of proper mentorship. The programme, he noted, was
purposely started after others had concluded theirs to ensure only needy boys
benefit.
 He
dismissed residents who have criticised the county for starting the programmem saying the prime role of devolution is to empower
the lives of locals.  “This programme is aimed at helping
the less fortunate in the society and guiding them towards become responsible members of the community,” he added. Boys with special needs have been given
a priority in the programme. At Kabati Academy centre in Kandara, five boys living with disability aged between 13 and 18 were among 173 initiates. Another
set of 2,000 boys was circumcised last year.
