He said some state officials have developed an insatiable urge for several advisers, who end up gobbling up a huge chunk of taxpayer money in remunerations.

There is need to strengthen a culture of competence, reward high performers and sanction nonperformers so the economy grows and more jobs are created for the youth,” he said during the exit ceremony for the first commissioners of  the Salaries and Remuneration Commission. “We have those who perform with commitment. Some are freeloaders, romourmongers who just gossip. We have some with over five advisers. Those advisers also have advisers. These are people who don’t know what they are doing and should leave.” More on this: Wage bill to hit Sh650 billion in 2018, Sarah Serem says as term ends Ruto expressed concern that about 40 million Kenyans pay taxes, but more than 52 per cent of the revenue is consumed by two per cent of public servants, leaving a small percentage of resources for development.
