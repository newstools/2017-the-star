Mwangaza Rehabilitation Centre, an NGO, on Saturday held a 10 KM walk to create awareness on drugs and substance abuse in Machakos County. Director John Ombasa said the high use of drugs and alcohol by school teenagers especially the boys had led to poor performance in the 2017 KCPE. "With KCPE examinations results showing girls performed more than boys, Mwangaza Rehabilitation Centre today organised a 10Km charity walk in Machakos County to raise awareness on effects of drugs and substance abuse which are some of the factors blamed for the dismal performance in academics," Ombasa said.

"Many children especially boys are abusing drugs, the unsuspecting parents think drug abuse is done only by street children with more emphasis on the girl child. The boy child is feeling neglected making them engage in criminal activities," he said. He said the NGO has been rescuing, rehabilitating, training and reintegrating street boys into the society since 2008. The rehabilitation program takes six months and each cohort comprises 32 children rescued from Nairobi and Machakos Counties streets. "More than 100 children have been rescued so far, on December 15, at least 32 boys will be graduating from the rehabilitation centre," Ombasa said. Ombasa said the graduands will join primary, secondary or vocational training centres of their choices.
