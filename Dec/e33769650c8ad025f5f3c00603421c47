A family from Kihumbu-ini village in Gatanga subcounty, Murang’a county, got a reprieve after Nairobi Women’s Hospital waived its Sh4.8 million after a relative died in the hospital. The family of 30-year-old Jeffitner Karanja has suffered for six months since he passed away on June 22. According to his brother John Wanjau, Karanja, who was a father of two, was attacked by robbers in Ngong on his way home from work in March. Karanja was hit on the head with a blunt object which raptured a ventricle and caused internal bleeding. He was rushed to Nairobi Women’s Hospital by well-wishers and put in the High Dependency Unit and later transferred to the ICU. Wanjau said his brother was in hospital until June, when he succumbed, leaving the family with a bill that ran into millions of shillings. Speaking to the Star yesterday, Wanjau said the hospital detained the body because the family was unable to clear the bill. “We were only able to raise Sh50,000 through a fundraising,” Wanjau said. He said the family has been living in sorrow, wondering how to raise the money. Wanjau said the family is yet to come to terms with the death.  As a last resort, the family enlisted the help of a lawyer, who is an acquaintance, in a bid to try and compel the hospital to release the body. But Justice John Mativo said the family was liable to pay the bill. The family approached the management of the hospital seeking the release of the body for burial. In a meeting held on Monday with the family, the hospital agreed to waive the entire bill, including mortuary fees. The hospital’s chief business development officer, Johnson Mwithi, confirmed the hospital has agreed to waive the bill after the family expressed its plight. However, the family will have to submit a letter from their chief confirming they are needy.
