Kisumu NASA supporters have told Raila Odinga not to relent in his plans for swearing-in as the People’s President. They said they are behind Raila and promised to patiently wait for him to announce a new date for the oath taking ceremony. Led by Kondele ODM chairman George Anayo, the group Raila should remain determined to ensure he is sworn in, no matter how long it takes. Anayo said they were optimistic NASA would announce a new date for the swearing-in. The ceremony had been scheduled for last Tuesday, before it was called off on Sunday. “We know the journey to Canaan has been full of ups and downs. But we are not giving up. We urge 'Baba’ to soldier on,” Anayo said. Manyatta bunge la wananchi speaker Harrison Ombore asked supporters not to lose hope.
