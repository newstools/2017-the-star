Graduates have been urged to be job creators and not jobseekers. Education CS Fred Matiang’i yesterday told 5,000 graduates they have acquired the necessary skills to be employers. These remarks were in a speech read on his behalf by Commission for University Education chairman Chacha Nyaigotti-Chacha during Kisii University's fifth graduation ceremony. Matiang’i said the Education ministry is committed to expanding institutions' infrastructure to enhance quality. Good infrastructure will enable institutions produce graduates who will compete globally. The university's current enrolment stands at 22,000, who all require good facilities to perform well in their studies. The graduation was attended by chancellor Godfrey Muriuki and vice chancellor John Akama. Chacha said the commission is committed towards providing quality education. He urged students to do more research to help spur development. “I am encouraging you to be job creators and not jobseekers, that is why the CS is insisting on the same,” Chacha said. “Universities are encouraged to invest in research because it is through the same that we can achieve positive development and at the same time handle future challenges.” Chacha said he was glad the land conflicts between the university and Nyamage Primary School, which is situated in the campus, has been resolved. Muriuki said universities are forced to hire unqualified lecturers due to low capitation from the government, compromising the quality of education. “There is need for the government to release money to universities in lump sum to enable the institutions to hire qualified lecturers as opposed to unqualified ones,” he said.
