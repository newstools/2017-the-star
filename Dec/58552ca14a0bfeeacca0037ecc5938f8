The government has planned a major health summit next year to discuss the sector’s problems. These include discord over the new Health Act. Council of Governors chairman Josphat Nanok yesterday said the meeting will take place before March. “We have planned this conference with the Health ministry and all these issues will be discussed,” he said. He spoke when CoG signed an agreement to recognise the Kenya Union of Clinical Officers. President Uhuru Kenyatta signed into law the controversial Health Act in June, despite protests from clinical officers and nurses. The law reserves all administrative jobs in the health system for doctors. It bars nurses and clinical officers from managing any facility bigger than a dispensary and health centre, even if they acquire management degrees. KUCO chairman Peterson Wachira said they oppose most provisions of the law and will present a memorandum at that meeting. “Now that we have signed a recognition agreement, we will try to solve those problems through the CBA in January. We will then seek amendments to that Act,” he told the Star. He said the summit is timely, because of “unacceptable” discrepancies in health services, pay scales and management. “For instance, the highest-paid clinical officer, with a degree, still earns less than half the salary of an intern doctor,” he said.  Maurice Opetu of the Kenya National Union of Nurses told the Star the meeting is timely.
