A rogue principal who drowned several mobile phones in water to destroy evidence of exam cheating is among the 40 teachers who might be sacked. Teachers Service Commission CEO Nancy Macharia said most of them were caught red-handed. Macharia said the list includes teachers who opened the exam material before set time and sent snapshots of the questions to students. “If found culpable we will dismiss and deregister them so they will never work any school, public or private,” Macharia said. She spoke yesterday at Nairobi School during the release of the 2017 Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education.

Education minister Fred Matiang'i said the rogue principal who drowned phones came from a public school in the Rift Valley, which he did not name. The phones were confiscated from students but he took them and dipped them in a bucket of water. “We have dissolved the board of that school and TSC is proceeding with disciplinary on the head-teacher and the teachers involved,” he said.

All these cases must be dealt with before the exams in 2018,” he said. Click here for the latest political news
