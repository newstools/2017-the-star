Kenya and DR Congo clubs renew their handball rivalry as the first edition of the JustBeMaster event gets underway today at the Moi, Kasarani. Kenya teams—Black Mamba, Strathmore University and National Cereals and Produce Board—succumbed to Police of Congo during last month’s East and Central Africa club tournament in Tanzania. Another Kenyan team Kenya Defence Forces will also have a chance to challenge for the trophy after they failed to participate in the club championship. Rwanda men’s handball team will also participate in the event. Mamba finished third behind compatriots Strathmore University and eventual winner Congo and coach Martin Abunde said the event will give them a chance to return the favour. “We are ready for the competition. Not only are we focusing on Congo but also on other Kenyan teams. It’s going to be a competitive event but we want to be among the best teams when the event comes to an end on Saturday,” said Abunde. Women’s teams have attracted Kenya league champions Nairobi Water, NCPB and fast-rising Divas. The event will also feature Kabaddi with Iraq and Tanzania among the nations already in the country. Sevens aside women’s football will feature Astroturf, Hammers AFC, Unlimited and Kayole Starlet ‘A’ and ‘B’. Event’s patron and Denmark-based player Brian Mathews said all the logistics are in place ahead of the event. Mathews said: “It’s the first event we are conducting and we hope to stage a success competition. At the end of it all, we hope to pick positives and make it even better next time.”
