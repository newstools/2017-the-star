Education scholars have asked the government to put more focus on the 87.79 per cent who completed the KCSE exam this year, but did not qualify to join universities. Led by Technical University of Kenya vice chancellor Francis Aduol, the scholars said the government can achieve this by putting priority on Technical and Vocational Education and Training Authority institutions offering technical skills. “This year, we have seen the results and it is evident [almost] 90 per cent have not qualified. What should be of concern is how to help this lot get slots to acquire technical skills through vocational training,” Aduol said. He spoke during a graduation ceremony at the university’s main campus where 1,400 graduands were conferred with degrees. Aduol said, “KCSE exam should not be regarded as a means by which you qualify for university, but a basis for general education to channel you towards a particular cause in life.” Aduol said the government should resume sponsorship of students pursuing diploma courses at TUK institutions. He said there’s need to promote science-related subjects in secondary schools .
