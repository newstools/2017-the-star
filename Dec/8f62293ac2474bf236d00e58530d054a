Sing’ore Girls’ High School, which topped the 2017 KCSE in the country, did not produce any straight A. The girls from the school, commonly known the Green Angels, produced 15 A- minuses, 165 B+ (plus), 83 B plain and eight B- minuses. Joyce Murisha, who scored an A-, said she did not expect her school to emerge top in the country. “The teachers and parents accorded us the required support as we prepared for our exams,” she said. The school has a mean score of 69.9 average mark to beat the country's academic giants including Light Academy (69.1), Alliance Girls (68.7), Kenya High and Loreto High schools. Principal Rose Koech said she was surprised for the top position in the country, but was not surprised with the former students sterling grades. “The girls lived up to our motto: Unique sacrifice, unique results. They upheld discipline, hard work and trust in God led to achieve these results,” she said.
