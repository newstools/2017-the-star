Families of the two victims whose bodies are yet to be retrieved from Lake Nakuru have been camping on the shores.  It has been 47 days since the helicopter crashed into the lake, killing all the five on board. The families have been hoping for a successful recovery. The families and friends have been camping in Lake Nakuru National Park, praying that the bodies will be retrieved and given a decent burial.  The occupants were Nakuru Senator Susan Kihika’s bloggers Sam Gitau, John Mapozi and Anthony Kipyegon. The others were pilot Apollo Malowa and a lady friend, Veronica Muthoni. The chopper crashed moments after take-off from Jarika Hotel, Nakuru. The chopper was said to have been headed to Narok for Jubilee campaigns. The bodies of Malowa, Kipyegon and Muthoni were retrieved and buried. A combined force of Kenya Navy, Kenya Police, Kenya Wildlife Service, Kenya Forest Service and divers from Naivasha has been conducting the search since the incident happened. “We have been camping on the shores of the lake hoping our loved ones’ bodies will be rescued. We are helpless. We can only wait and see if the recovery will be successful,” said Gitau’s father William Mwangi.  He said he has been watching the recovery teams comb the lake without success. Mwangi said he lost his only son and an important pillar in his extended family. Gitau was the firstborn in a family of four. The team of divers that has been leading the search seemed discouraged by the failure to retrieve the remaining bodies. National Disaster Operation Centre officer Jonathan Kertich yesterday said the divers are still searching the waters and searching along the shores. “We have searched all the waters. We are still searching, hoping for a successful recovery of the two remaining bodies. We would like them to give a good send-off to their loved ones,” Kertich said.
