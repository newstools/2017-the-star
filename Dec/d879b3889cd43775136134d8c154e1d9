On Wednesday, the company’s started producing power to support its internal requirements. Company CEO Nashon Aseka said they will start selling electricity to Kenya Power. “After producing the eight megawatts used as captive power, we can sell the rest to Kenya Power,” Aseka said. The miller is producing 18 megawatts. Eight is used in the company with the rest exported to the national grid. Factory manager Josphat Asira said the current production is only half of the company’s maximum capacity.
