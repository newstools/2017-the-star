Kisumu youth have demanded inclusion in Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o’s government or they will take legal action. The Kisumu County Youth Movement accused Nyong’o of failing to appoint a youth in his cabinet. Led by convener George Abwajo, the more than 50 youths said Nyong’o ought to have considered regional balance, equity, youth and marginalised groups in the constitution of his cabinet. Addressing the press in Kisumu yesterday, the youths praised Nyong’o for his hard work but asked him to engage them in the management of county affairs.  “As youths, we missed out in the executive appointments. We therefore demand that we be given an opportunity in the running of county affairs,” Abwajo said. Nyong’o, who is yet to name his chief officers, has promised an inclusive government.  “We want a third of the position of chief officers in the coming appointments,” Abwajo said. Nyong’o is also expected to constitute an 11-member city management board, where a number of leaders are lobbying for seats. Abwajo said they will move to court or resort to mass action if the governor fails to address their grievances. “We have sent emissaries to the governor without any feedback. We hope he will address our issues,” Abwajo said. He also demanded that 30 percent of contracts be preserved for the youth and women.
