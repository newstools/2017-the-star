Kajiado Governor Joseph Lenku has fired his top water county official for failing to address a long-standing problem of salty water in taps.  The Star on Wednesday learnt that Lenku sent home Olkejuado Water and Sewerage Company CEO Joshua Tapataiya after years of supply of water unfit for domestic use.  “Hotels in Kajiado cannot give free water to customers after meals. Residents cannot wash their clothes without risking discolouration,” Lenku said in a statement.  Most of the water in local taps is salty, with traders forced to buy drinking water from merchants who operate boreholes.  The governor said the water firm failed to address water scarcity and he needs a new and fresh team to tackle the problem.  Water executive Florence Waiganjo on Wednesday said the company failed to give the county government any strategy on how it would supply clean water to residents.
