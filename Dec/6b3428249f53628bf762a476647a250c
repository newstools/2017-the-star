The Kenyan and French governments have launched a solar power project at Kenyatta University. The pilot project, funded through a grant by the French government, will produce 100 kw that will be connected to the national grid. French Minister of Ecological and Inclusive Transition Nicolas Hulot during the commissioning on Monday said the project is a milestone in the two countries’ battle against climate change.  He said the French government is willing to support Kenya in promoting use of renewable energy to combat climate.  Energy Cabinet Secretary Charles Keter said with the help Kenya is receiving from the French government and other development partners, the country will be able to achieve the objective of universal electrification by  2020.
