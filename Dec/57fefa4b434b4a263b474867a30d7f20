Starring:  Claire Foy, Matt Smith, Vanessa Kirby, Jeremy Northam, Victoria Hamilton, Alex Jennings Genre: Drama / Biopic Created by: Peter Morgan Season release: December 8   December 8 was probably the most-awaited television premier day this year. Whilst the first season of The Crown dazzled us with the romance and heartbreaks, the second season takes us through treacherous and testing periods.  Thanks to Netflix’s full season streaming ability, the whole season can (and was) binged watched by many in the span of one weekend. This season chronicles the queen’s life from 1957 to 1963, of course, with the occasional flashback to previous years. After the war, Elizabeth finds herself a fading symbol of a great monarchy as the country’s dynamics have changed and most of the elites have been replaced by the working class. She is determined to find a way to preserve the monarchy before the institution is replaced by a republic. She also faces internal struggles of her failing marriage, the birth of her two children, as well as the pressure of losing control in most of the British Empire.               The show highlights important issues that took place within this time frame whilst hinting at some sensitive things, such as a scandalous affair between Price Philip and a Russian ballerina.  Another interesting part about this season is that we got to dig a little deeper into some of the other characters’ lives. For instance, the creator developed Prince Philip’s character profoundly, so that we got an insight into his ‘mysterious’ past. The show has recently revealed its plan in having the main characters change every two seasons to represent the different ages. So this is the last season of the show starring Claire Foy. The role of a middle-aged Queen Elizabeth II will be played by Olivia Coleman.     Star Rating:
