Owners of idle land will have to pay tax or agree with the government in a plan put the same commercial use for food production to feed the surging population. Agriculture CS Willy Bett said the ministry has already identified over 60,000 acres of unused public land which will be put to use for farming under a public-private partnership arrangement. "Over and above utilising the idle public land, the government will work with relevant authorities in charge of land in the country with a view to developing and enacting new laws that will also allow private idle land to be converted into agricultural production centres," he said. Bett said as the country struggles to feed itself, it is regrettable to note that there are huge chunks of arable land lying idle in various parts of Kenya. "We are going to commercialise all the public land which is not in use. Let the concerned make them available to commercial investors to produce food for the country starting from January." He spoke during a national small-holder commercialisation meeting in Nairobi on Wednesday. The CS said they will work with the lands ministry to enact laws so that even private landowners will be compelled to either use their parcels or lease the same to commercial entrepreneurs who are willing to use the land. "Anyone owning, for instance, 10,000 acres of land, and not using it will either pay taxes on it or make the same available for commercial use," Bett said. "I think this is not too much to ask because if you have land which you are not using, and we need to use it so that we can feed Kenyans, it is only fair that we compel you in one way or another to avail that land for production." Bett said the ministry will be looking at the law under which the directive will be implemented. Click here for the latest political news Â
