As they look to build up on the strong finish they enjoyed towards the end of the 2017 Sportpesa Premier League campaign, AFC Leopards have once again made an early move in the transfer market that ended last week by snapping up Ezekiel Otuoma from relegated Western Stima. Otuoma, a former Muhoroni Youth and Ulinzi Stars forward, has signed a two-year contract with Ingwe. He becomes the fifth player to be signed by Ingwe so far after Nakumatt goalkeeper Ezekiel Owade and Ugandan winger Baker Alukoya, who was scouted from Soana FC by coach Robert Matano during his two-week long visit to Uganda in November. Earlier Leopards had completed the signing of former Gor Mahia and Nairobi City Stars forward Ezekiel Odera and enterprising Western Stima midfielder Robert Achema, each on two-year contracts. Leopards’ chairman Dan Mule said on the KPL official portal that he was delighted that the technical bench had started working in good time, as they plan to give a good account of themselves next year when they take on their African opponents in the Confederation Cup and locally in the SportPesa Premier League. “The technical bench is doing all the recruitment work. They gave us a list of the players they want and we are working very hard to ensure that we have them in the team before we break for the Christmas festivities,” Mule said. He added: “Otuoma is a good winger with enough Premier League experience, and the two Ugandans (Achema and Alukoya) are definitely bound to bring some competition within the team,” he said. Matano has been on record saying Leopards needed quality players to challenge for top honours next season. The Ingwe camp indicates they need two more strikers and one defender. The club had a troubled 2017 season that saw them summarily change coaches three times before eventually finishing eighth.
