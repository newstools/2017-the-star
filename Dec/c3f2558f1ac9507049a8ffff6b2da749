The manner in which a former GSU officer escaped from Siaya GK Prison last week showed laxity by officers on duty, the regional commander has said. Francis Musyoka, a former General Service Unit officer who had been on death row, escaped last Thursday and is yet to be found.

If the six officers are found guilty of laxity, they will have to pay the ultimate price." Misiki said on Monday that all prison staff will be investigated. “We suspect the inmate may have had the help of some staff," he said, adding they will involve the CID department. Among the six are the sergeant in charge of the shift, gatekeeper, sergeant in charge of the compound and two officers who were manning the watchtower. Misik said Musyoka was among four prisoners who cut the grills at the prison in 2014. He said three escaped at that time while the former GSU officer was left behind. The prisoner was to appear at Siaya Law Courts today over a case in which he was sentenced to life in prison. Misik cautioned Musyoka is "very dangerous and could be planning another robbery". He asked the public to give information that may lead to his arrest. Click here for the latest political news
