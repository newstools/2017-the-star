Gem MP Elisha Odhiambo has said they will summon Education CS Fred Matiang'i to Parliament to explain the mass failures in this year's KCSE exam. He said the CS should  be blamed for the more than 80 per cent of candidates who failed to meet university entry requirements of C+ grade and above. "Matiang’i is so irrational and should not be allowed to hold state office especially after it has been proved that he has failed the entire education system." This year, 87.79 per cent of the candidates — 540,428 students — scored between grade C and E. Only 70,073, roughly 11 per cent, can join university.

I believe our students did better than what we are made to believe." He questioned what will happen to those who will not join universities in 2018, a matter that has been raised by many other leaders and education stakeholders.  "What will happen to the 545,700 students? I know they exceed the middle level and technical colleges," he said. He added that this years results is clear indication that Matiang'i is not competent to run the affairs of the ministry.  Read: Mass failures: What happened? Did all schools cheat?
