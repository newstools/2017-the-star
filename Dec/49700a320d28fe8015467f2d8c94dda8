Residents in Laikipia county want President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto to visit the region and have first-hand information on the destruction caused by migrant herders. County assembly majority leader Peter Thomi said the two have an obligation to listen to them now that they have assumed office. The MCA said the region has experienced a lot of insecurity and want assurance from the two. Addressing the media yesterday in his Nanyuki town office, Thomi said local leaders have in the past urged Uhuru to particularly visit Laikipia North and West subcounties. He said the loss caused by herders amounts to billions of shillings. Thomi urged the opposition to accept that elections are over and that Uhuru won. Thoi told opposition chief Raila Odinga to set a good example to the upcoming leaders that once a candidate is defeated in a democratic election, they should accept the results. He added that the region expects a lot from Jubilee, including restoration of security, building of roads and setting up water reservoirs to end the perennial shortage.
