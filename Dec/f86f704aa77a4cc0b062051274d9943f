Former Belgut MP Eric Keter died at a Nairobi hospital on Sunday after reportedly suffering a heart attack. He owned Milimani Grammar Schools in Kericho and Bomet counties. Keter won the Belgut seat on a KANU ticket during the 2013 general election. Before his death, he fought hard to defend the seat on a Jubilee Party ticket but lost the nominations to current MP Nelson Koech. Dissatisfied with the way Jubilee conducted the primaries, Keter opted to defend the seat as an independent candidate.  Click here for the latest political stories
