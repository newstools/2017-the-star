President Uhuru Kenyatta has mourned three Bishops of the African Independent Pentecostal Church of Africa (AIPCA) who lost their lives in a road accident along the Embu-Mwea road. Bishop Philip Kubai, chairman of Bishop's synod from Ntonyiri Diocese, Bishop Moses Ntoreruri of Igembe Diocese and Bishop Stanley Kalulu from Igembe Central Diocese were killed in the crash at Mutithi last night. The President said the death of the clergymen was a big loss not only to their families but also to the larger Kenyan society.  He urged motorists to observe traffic laws, which are key to road safety. The clergy perished on the spot after their saloon car collided with another at Wamumu area. Witnesses said the accident occurred at around 8:30 pm as the ministers were travelling to Nairobi after attending a church function in Embu.
