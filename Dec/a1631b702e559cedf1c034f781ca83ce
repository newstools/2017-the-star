The volume of tea exported during the first 10 months of this year declined in 80 per cent of Kenya’s top 10 export destinations, data by the Tea Directorate show. Afghanistan reduced its tea imports by 75 per cent to 8,471,605 kilos, Egypt cut its tea imports by 35 per cent to 52,796,402 kilos, while the United Arab Emirates and Sudan sliced imports by 20 per cent to 24,568,203 and 17,657,174 kilos. Tea exports in eight of the leading markets reduced by 73,546,583 kilos during the period, while Pakistan and Poland reported a cumulative growth of 15,032,008 kilos, bringing the total reduction to 58,514,575 kilos. Other markets which reduced their tea imports include UK, Russia, Yemen and Kazakhstan. The total quantity of tea sold during the period under review declined by 15 per cent, or 63,393,293 kilos, meaning that the top 10 markets accounted for at least 92.30 per cent of the reduction. The directorate has attributed lower export rates in most of its destinations to reduced production as a result of irregular weather patterns experienced throughout 2017. “Our production is significantly lower year to date compared to last year and this will naturally affect all our exports compared with last year,” the directorate told the Star. This, the directorate said, has ultimately led to an increase in tea prices, with some destinations opting out to seek cheaper markets. “As production decreases, the export price of Kenyan tea increases, pushing away some destinations that prefer cheaper teas and can no longer afford Kenyan teas,” the directorate said. “This explains why some markets will not buy from Kenya until weather patterns change.”
