Many are called but few are chosen. This gospel producer, who has walked away with numerous gospel awards, is turning out to be a notorious con artist who has perfected his skill in conning unsuspecting talents. After he made his name as one of the most-sought-after producers in the gospel arena, the producer got a lot of business from hopeful upcoming acts, who wanted some of his magic to propel them in the music world. He took advantage of them and promised to record their music at a ridiculously low fee. To entice them further, the producer sweetens the deal by promising to shoot a music video for them. As the Raverend, I can tell you for free that for Sh40,000, the most you can get is a music video shot with a phone. But the producer would lie that the amount was sufficient for a world-class production. The gullible artistes would fork out the cash, hit the studio for an hour or so and them wait to be called for the video shoot. When the day never reaches, they call the producer, who then takes them round and round. One college student narrated how he did the same thing to her.  “I trusted this person because he had a name in the music industry. Little did I know that it was just a name. Nilitapeliwa,” she told me. “I’ve used so much money, time and energy to get the audios from him, I was almost giving up on music altogether.  “It was so bad till God shone his light on me. Now, I have an honest and talented producer who has redone the songs and they are doing better on the music charts.” Another singer took a loan to finance an album produced by the same producer, and once she had paid him the full amount, she hit the studio for three sessions, where she recorded two songs and then the producer started playing hookie. The poor woman gave up on music altogether and has since refused to revisit the episode because she is still pained by how he conned her in the name of producing music. And the worst part of it all is that she has nothing to show for it.
