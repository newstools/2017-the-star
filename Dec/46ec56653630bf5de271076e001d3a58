Strathmore Gladiators have erased their relegation fears following their two wins in the Kenya Hockey Union Premier League over the weekend. By clobbering Nakuru yesterday and Chase Sailors (on Saturday), the varsity side, who have been a pale shadow of a former champion. After losing 0-2 to Western Jaguars on December 10 at home, Meshack Senge’s charges’ have improved to register a draw and two wins in seven days. Strathmore beat Chase Sailors 2-1 and Nakuru 2-0 after a 1-1 stalemate against Kenya College of Accountancy University in their mid-week duel to hop into the 30-points on the standings. In an entertaining match yesterday afternoon, both Gladiators and Nakuru mounted water-tight defence to register goalless 45 minutes before the visitors conceded two successive goals in the last period. Paul Machin gave Strathmore the lead when he sounded the board in the 50th minute. And even before Nakuru regrouped, Jerry Ogaso slotted in the winner for the students three minutes later. “It has been about acknowledging where we were and knowing that it wasn’t a pleasant position. We knew what we are capable of so the boys fought to restore our winning ways,” said Senge. “We are in the process of creating a formidable team and strengthening the leadership units within the playing unit. We are also striving to achieve synergy of mentality going forward.” Though Nakuru shared spoils on Saturday (against Parkroad) and surrendered maximum points to Strathmore, they still maintain their mid-table status. In the Nationwide Men’s division ‘A’ league, Wazalendo Masters clipped visiting Mombasa Sports Club 1-0 to stamp their leadership as they draw closer to end of the season. Telkom’s unbeaten streak got another boost after the University of Nairobi down-played the women’s premiership tie to honour Kenya Universities Sports Association’s annual tournament fixtures in Nyeri. Telkom were awarded three points and five goals.
