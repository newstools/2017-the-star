Samburu residents have been urged to donate blood to help in the treatment of locals. The Samburu County Referral Hospital needs blood to treat many cases of anaemia, poor nutrition and those admitted with complications arising from caeserean section deliveries.  Speaking at Kenyatta Stadium in Maralal town yesterday,  Lilly Beatrice, a recruiter from the Kenya Blood Transfusion Services, said Samburu hospitals ask for more than 100 units of blood from the Nakuru blood bank every month. “That is why residents need to donate blood to save lives of those in critical conditions,” she said. KBTS had organised a blood donation drive in Maralal to mobilise residents to donate blood. Beatrice said she was happy with the turn up. Samples of the blood collected will first be taken for testing at the Nakuru lab before being sent back to Samburu for use.  Health chief officer Lydia Letinina said they will continue with the donation campaign. “We will be inviting residents to donate blood every two months to ensure we have enough stock,” she said.
