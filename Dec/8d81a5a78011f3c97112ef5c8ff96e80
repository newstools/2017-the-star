After taking over the reigns at Tusker from Uganda George Nsiimbe, Francis Baraza was taking up a challenge that not many would have given a chance to rigour through. However, Baraza ­— in acting capacity — went on to prove a crucial figure in rescuing the immediate former champions’ ship and this has come with a prize. The former Chemelil has been named the October Fidelity Insurance Coach of the Month with three victories and a draw.  He launched his interim spell with a scoreless draw at home to high-flying debutants Kariobangi Sharks before overcoming Muhoroni Youth, Nakumatt and Posta Rangers. The 10 points saw Baraza easily scoop the Sh75,000 cash prize and a personalised plaque with he fingers crossed that the feats of the last few months will secure him the head coach role. The former Kenyan international defender confounded many when he quit his head coach position at Chemelil Sugar to take up Tusker FC’s assistant coaching role at the end of 2016 season. However, his ambitions to win the championship with the Ruaraka-based side never materialised as Tusker surrendered the title to Gor Mahia. “I had a good time at Chemelil Sugar and we performed well as a team, finishing in the highest position ever since the club was promoted. So when many people thought and wanted me to stay, I saw fresh and bigger challenge at Tusker and that is why I decided to join the brewers albeit as an assistant coach,” said Baraza. “I had the chance to learn under a more experienced coach and even though things did not turn out so well for the team we managed to salvage what we could.” While at Chemelil, Baraza had won the August 2016 Coach of the Month, joining Western Stima’s Henry Omino as the only tacticians to have won the more than once since its inception at the beginning of 2016.
