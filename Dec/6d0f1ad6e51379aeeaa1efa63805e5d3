Planning and Statistics PS Irungu Nyakera has asked the government to prioritise youth employment in its 2018 agenda. Nyakera yesterday said it is unfortunate that despite the tremendous economic growth witnessed in the country, youth still constitute an overwhelming majority of the unemployed. The PS said besides retarding the nation’s potential and economic growth prospects, disenfranchised youth are highly likely to engage in crime. As witnessed over the last few months, idle youth will be used as a tool of aggression and political unrest, the PS added. “As the population expands and more young people join the job market, the consequences of youth unemployment, if left unresolved, can be detrimental,” Nyakera said in a statement.

The PS said although President Uhuru Kenyatta’s manifesto underscores focus on job-creating sectors, many youth still continue to suffer. “These growth oriented sectors will offer initiatives, projects, and programmes that support youth employment,” Nyakera said. Youth are set to be the greatest beneficiaries of the 6.5 million targeted jobs in five years. The PS said it is important to ensure youth have the right education and skills to take on future employment. Some of the significant interventions to be rolled out include upskilling Technical Vocational Education & Training.
