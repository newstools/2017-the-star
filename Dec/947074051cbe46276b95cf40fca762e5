Nandi Governor Stephen Sang (pictured) wants an immediate end to timber logging in all government forests in his county. Sang said the wanton destruction of the forests under the cover of Kenya Forest Service had seriously contributed to environmental degradation in Nandi. The governor questioned the sincerity of the KFS in issuing licences for the harvesting of indigenous trees that have taken over 300 years to mature. Speaking at the Kapsabet showground during Jamhuri Day celebrations, Sang said the ongoing logging has far-reaching implications on the forest cover in Nandi county. He asked KFS director to suspend licensing until an agreement was reached with his government on the mode of harvesting for mature exotic plantations and total ban on cutting indigenous trees. “We cannot sit back and be spectators and allow a cartel of millers and KFS officers out to wipe out our forest cover in Nandi, a resource given to us by God,” Sang said. He warned that the trend at which trees were being felled by loggers had reached a dangerous point that required his to move in.  Sang also differed with Nandi Senator Samson Cherargey over the appointment of chief officers, saying the duty to do that was legally bestowed on him and the county representatives.
