Muslims in Garissa have called on their fellow worshipers who do not observe Mawlid-al-Nabi - Prophet Mohamed’s birthday - to read the Koran and understand its importance. Muslims generally celebrate the birth of Prophet Mohamed on the 12th day of the third month of the Islamic calendar, called Rabi’ al-Awwal. Because the lunar calendar advances 11 days each year, the prophet’s birthday changes year-to-year, and falls on Wednesday this year.  It begins Tuesday at sunset, and Shiites generally celebrate a few days later.  Not all Muslims celebrate the day because its observance lacks a basis in Islamic teachings.  Mawlid al-Nabi (the prophet’s birthday), as it is called in many countries, is often associated with Sufi strains of Islam.  Some countries, including Saudi Arabia, do not publicly recognise the holiday, viewing it as an unnecessary religious innovation.  Mohamed is believed to have been born in Mecca in the year 570 in the tribe of Quraysh.  Speaking at Garissa Primary School on Thursday after holding a procession to mark the day, Hassan Ngarawa, a cleric of the Ahlsunna Waljamaa community, called on those who do not observe it to read the Koran.  He said those who oppose the celebration are ignorant.
