Nyamira Majority leader and Township MCA Duke Masira has said the assembly will call a special sitting to pass the People’s Assembly Bill. He said the Bill was not passed because MCAs (pictured) had not received official communication from the NASA secretariat to do so. Masira spoke on Friday. He said Nyamira, which is a NASA stronghold, will not be left behind in passing the Bill. The county assembly adjourned for a long recess on Thursday without passing the Bill as had been expected. Sittings will resume on February 12. The majority of MCAs in Nyamira are allied to the opposition NASA and passing the bill would be easy.
