Individuals who operate their private cars as PSVs will be prosecuted, the road safety agency has warned. National Transport and Safety Authority director general Francis Meja said officers will work closely with traffic police to arrest the offenders. “We are also working with the Public Service Vehicles that operate within the law to help us identify the culprits,” he told the Star on the phone. The owners of private vehicles operating illegally line up in the CBD to cash in on passengers travelling upcountry for the festive season. Meja said these will be charged. “Everyone must obey traffic rules,” he added. Statistics from the NTSA show 2,605 people have died on Kenyan roads this year, compared to 2,722 last year. This is according to comparative statistics as at December 5. According to the NTSA, 981 pedestrians have perished, compared to 1,018 in 2016, while 286 drivers have died, compared to 323 in 2016. Six hundred and twenty-three passengers have died, compared to 648 in 2016. Some 206 pillion passengers have perished, compared to 201 in 2016. Fifty-three pedal cyclists died compared to 68 in 2016.  Meja condemned the Homa Bay incident where boda boda operators torched a Nairobi-bound bus whose drive they accused of hitting one of their own. The attack, under investigation by the police, was an act of hooliganism. “That is a security issue and police are following up,” Meja said. The bus had stopped at a petrol station in Homa Bay town on Sunday to drop a passenger when a boda boda operator rammed into it from behind. Witnesses said luggage was being offloaded when the operator hit the bus and was injured. Boda Boda Association of Kenya chairman Kenneth Onyango condemned the attack. He said he is still collecting information on the incident.
