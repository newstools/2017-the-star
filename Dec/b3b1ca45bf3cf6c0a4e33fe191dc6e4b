Kisii Governor James Ongwae (pictured) yesterday said the county’s development plans have been hampered by financing delays from the national government. Ongwae said the county had not received its share of development money by the end of last month. “Our programmes have been hurt by the delays. We have not received our share of revenue,” the governor said. Ongwae spoke at Gusii Stadium where he attended this year’s Jamhuri Day rally. The governor said last week, President Uhuru Kenyatta signed into law the County Allocation of Revenue Amendment Bill, expressing optimism the money will be disbursed to facilitate development projects. The county has allocated Sh315 million for construction of additional county roads and a further Sh316 million for maintenance of existing ones as provided for in the Road Maintenance Policy. Present at the fete were Deputy Governor Joash Maangi, county commissioner Godfrey Kigochi, county assembly speaker David Kombo, county executives and MCAs. Ongwae said his administration is committed to fulfilling the pledges he made to the people during campaigns. “On August 8, residents voted for my deputy and me for the second term in office, re-affirming their faith in our leadership,” he added. The governor said even though Kenyans celebrate Independence, they must ensure unity. Ongwae said there is a need to teach children where the country has come from and the virtues of peace.
