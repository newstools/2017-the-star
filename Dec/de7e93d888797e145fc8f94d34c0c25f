â€‹Knut has hinted at either a nationwide strike or court battle if the teachers’ employer and Ministry of Education  enforce “uncolsulted” polices. Yesterday, Knut secretary general Willison Sossion rejected all the recent policies announced by the Teachers Service Commission and Education CS Fred Matiang’i, whom he termed a “dictator”. Sossion dismissed substantive appointments of head teachers, principals and their number twos. He said no boards of secondary and primary schools will be merged for ‘merely’ sharing a compound. The ODM nominated MP said the government will not supply textbooks to schools and force them on teachers because “it is a major scandal in the offing”. Sossion said the new curriculum will not take effect next year, adding teachers will not support it.  “Foreigners are pushing it and the government has been held captive,” he said. Sossion said head teachers and deputies will not be forced to acquire Bachelors of Education degree to retain their positions. The same will apply to principals and their assistants told to get Masters of Education degrees to be secure. The fiery activist announced teachers will serve in their home counties and the TSC will not succeed in delocalising them. These pronouncements set the stage for a battle. These polices, the TSC and Ministry of Education said, are aimed at “reforming the education sector”. They said they are “unstoppable” because they are long overdue. But Sossion said some of the policies are a trap to sack teachers. He cited substantive appointments and scrapping of demotion by the TSC, which he said targets to layoff nonperforming teachers. “When they tell you that there will henceforth be no demotion and your appointments will be substantive, what do they mean?” he posed. Sossion said, “It means, if you fail to deliver they will just write your sack letters because thy have no altrenative.”
