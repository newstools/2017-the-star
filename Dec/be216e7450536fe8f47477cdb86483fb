Stanley Munene, the investigating officer, said they were yet to record a statement from key witnesses. According to court documents, Kioho murdered his son aged 7 years and 2-year-old daughter by stabbing them. The case will come up again on January 15. Kioho stabbed his son and daughter in their chests before taking poison. Neighbors who spoke to The Star on Wednesday morning said Kioho's inhumane act was triggered by a quarrel with his wife, whom he had left at their rural home in Naromoru in Laikipia county. The neighbours said the man, whom they described as sociable, called the woman last evening to inform her that he would kill their children and then himself. “He left on December 23 for Christmas only to return with the kids on December 26. I met him while he headed to the shops. He greeted me and wished me happy holidays," said neighbour Julius Mullei. "The children were in his house playing and laughing. No one would have suspected he would commit such a heinous crime." Click here for latest political news
