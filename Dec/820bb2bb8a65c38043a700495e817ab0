Aden Duale has scoffed at a plan by two NASA MPs for Parliament to be recalled for discussions on mass failure in KCSE tests. The fiery Garissa Town MP and National Assembly Majority leader hit out at Saboti MP Caleb Amisi and Uriri's Mark Ogolla for "attempting to usurp powers preserved for House leaders of majority and minority parties". Duale said that under Standing Orders, the House can only be recalled by Speaker Justin Muturi on request, by either he or Minority leader John Mbadi who is Suba South MP. “It is ridiculous that they can purport to have any powers to write to the Speaker to recall the House. It’s only the leader of minority or majority who can write to the Speaker on recalling Parliament on a matter of national importance,” he told The Star from Cairo in Egypt on Wednesday. “The two MPs must read and understand the Standing Orders.” Amisi and Ogolla earlier said they had written to Muturi asking for the recall of the National Assembly to discuss what they termed “shockingly serendipitous massive failures by candidates.” The bicameral House is currently on a long recess until mid February. In their letter to Muturi, the MPs said: "We implore you to recall Honourable Members of Parliament from recess, for a special sitting of the House pursuant to Standing Order number 29, to debate the 2017 KCSE results." They also hinted at sponsoring a motion to censure Education CS Fred Matiang’i whom they accused of messing up the sector through hurried reforms. "The Impeachment of [Education Cabinet Secretary Fred] Matiangi is among the cards on the table," they said.
