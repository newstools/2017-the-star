Embu ambulance drivers and nurses have demonstrated against what they call harassment and manhandling by police. They also protested against the refusal by miraa pickup truck drivers to give way to them in emergencies when their sirens are blaring. On Thursday the drivers and the nurses marched to the area Traffic base commandant’s office and said they were being stopped and mistreated by police while they were rushing patients to public and private hospitals. They demanded police intervention. The ambulance crews said sometimes miraa drivers cause accidents, endangering the lives of patients already in critical condition. Sometimes ambulance drivers have been charged with alleged reckless driving after the miraa drivers refused to give way and accidents occurred, they said. At times they have been forced to transfer patients into ordinary vehicles to take them to hospital. This is because they are forced to wait until police arrive to investigate.   Driver Eric Joseph Ndwiga told reporters that on Wednesday, he was charged in connection with an accident along Kiritiri Embu road after a speeding miraa vehicle struck his ambulance. He said he and the crew had to ask a motorist to carry the patient to Embu Level 5 Teaching and Referral Hospital after the miraa driver forced them to wait for police. Driver Solomon Musyoka complained motorists take advantage of the ambulances responding to emergencies and follow them. Musyoka said instead of helping them, police have been turning against ambulance crews. Nurse Nesate Weveti sometimes they have "lost" their valuables during police stops?
