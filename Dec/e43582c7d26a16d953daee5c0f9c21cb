The government has released an extra Sh1 billion to the National Cereals and Produce Board to pay maize farmers. CEO Newton Terer said farmers will be paid in all its depots. There are long queues in depots, especially in high maize producing areas such as Eldoret, Moi’s Bridge and Kitale. “We are happy the government released the money. Farmers can now be paid ahead of Christmas festivities,” director of Kenya Farmers Association Kipkorir Menjo said. Farmers had asked the government to release all the Sh6 billion set aside for maize purchase. The board has already bought more than 700,000 bags “Farmers want to be paid as soon as they deliver their produce to plan early for next year,” Menjo said. Three weeks ago the government paid farmers Sh600 million. So far, the government has released Sh1.6 billion. NCPB officials have denied claims by farmers that it is buying imported maize from influential traders pretending to be local producers. Last week, farmers protested at the board’s depot in Eldoret, saying the importers are given priority. “There are two queues for those delivering maize at the depot in Eldoret. One for genuine farmers, and another one for importers,” Menjo said. But NCPB spokesman Titus Maiyo said they are still processing the subsidised government maize bought from Mexico. “We still have a quantity of the subsidised maize at the port. The NCPB is processing it and forwarding to the millers,” he said. The process has however now been suspended and there is only one queuemade up of farmers. The NCPB is expected to buy more than 1.5 million bags of maize by the end of the month. President Uhuru Kenyatta directed the board to buy all the maize from farmers. The NCPB is buying the maize at Sh3,200 per 90kg bag.
