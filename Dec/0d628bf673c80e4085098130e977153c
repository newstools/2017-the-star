Lexxy Majira — real name Alex Esau — says his songs are out to bring behavioural change to youngsters, and create an image and a message never to be forgotten. His recent release talks about Africa’s unity, which can be accomplished through practicing good morals. Lexxy can, however, celebrate his victory as he has released four videos and eight music audios. With the political uncertainties that have faced the country, Lexxy says his songs are mainly advocating peace and coexistence. “This year ,I attended the African Youth Forum in Nairobi to discuss peace of this country by involving the most affected, who are the street kids,” Lexxy said. Speaking to Word is, Lexxy said he has straggled a lot as he was once a street kid, with no place to call home. Losing his parents at eight years completely changed his life, as he was forced to move from town to town around the country to look for a place to call home. “There was a time I was beaten up by a police officer close to death just because I was sleeping on the street,” Lexxy recalls his past struggles. Joining a children’s home in Nakuru back in 2014 was what helped him in life. Through the hardships he has encountered, Lexxy said he was forced to do drugs. With other street children, he formed Kenyan Street Family Art, a group where they fought for the rights of the homeless through campaigns. He is also determined to be a voice of the street families as he has experienced and has the knowledge on how these families survive in the street. “It is not the will of someone to be a street kid, you just find yourself in the situation," he said.
