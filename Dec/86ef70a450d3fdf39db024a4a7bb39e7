Fifty-one youths from St Patrick’s Catholic Parish, Burnt Forest, yesterday were involved in a road accident in Sachang’wan, on the Nakuru-Eldoret highway. A witness said the driver was trying to avoid a private car that was overtaking when he lost control and the bus overturned. The youths, who have been attending a one-week conference at the church, were headed to Subukia shrine in Nakuru. Two were rushed to Nakuru Provincial General Hospital in critical condition while six sustained serious injuries. The rest received first aid. “We were headed to Subukia when a private car sped towards us prompting our driver to swerve and lose control,” Nancy Cheptoo said. The accident came barely a week after 37 people lost their lives on the Salgaa-Sachang’wan stretch and a little over a week after seven musicians died in an accident in Kamara. On Saturday night 10 people perished in Makutano on the same highway.
