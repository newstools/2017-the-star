Kenya Livestock Marketing Council chairman Dubat Amey wants the list of EALA candidates withdrawn and a new one reconstituted. Amey yesterday said the names presented to Parliament by Jubilee and NASA were mainly party loyalists and close relatives of party leaders.  He said in Garissa town that criteria used to arrive at the nominees does not augur well for efforts being put in place to end deep-seated political differences, following the protracted election period. “Don’t we have Kenyan technocrats with fresh ideas that can propel this country, rather than recycling old leaders with the same old mentality and who, in the past, have added no value to the politics of this country?” Amey asked. “The list consists of leaders whose background and past are questionable. They’ve been in government and other institutions, which they did little to transform. We’re tired of seeing the same faces and individuals over and over again.” Kenyans expect that going forward, appointments to key positions in the country will be filled based on ideas, regional balance and aspirations that unify the country, he said. ODM submitted the names of former MP Oburu Oginga, Fatuma Ali, Abubakar Zein, Abubakar Aden, Beth Syengo and Loy Maviala, while wiper fronted Kennedy Musyoka (Kalonzo Musyoka’s son), Angela Munyasya and Winfed Mutua. ANC settled on NASA CEO Norman Magaya, Jane Marwa and Justus Mochoge. JP’s list largely consists of former MPs and civil servants — among them Charles Nyachae and Simon Mbugua. Amey said at Independence, President Jomo Kenyatta picked technocrats, irrespective of their colour, religion or political affiliations. “He picked people of Arab descent, Europeans, Indians and minority ethnic groups. Nowadays, you rarely see these faces when it comes to public appointments,” he added. He said Kenyans must “retrace our steps. If we have to unite this country, we should start with appointments to key positions so all Kenyans feel included in government.”
