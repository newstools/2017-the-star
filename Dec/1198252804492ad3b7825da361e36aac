NASA leader Raila Odinga will be arrested if he will be sworn in as ‘the people’s assembly president’ tomorrow. Devolution CS Mwangi Kiunjuri said it is against the Constitution and treasonable to swear in another President since the country cannot have two leaders. “There comes a time when one cannot cross the red line. We want to remind Raila that he has crossed the red line and since he has decided to go against the Constitution, the police shall have no option but to arrest and lock him up,” he said.
