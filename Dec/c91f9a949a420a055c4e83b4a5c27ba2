Primary school heads have opposed a directive by Education CS Fred Matiang’i for schools that share a compound to have one principal and two deputies.  On Monday, Matiang’i said primary and secondary schools in one compound will have one board. Each of the schools will have a deputy head teacher.  Kenya Primary Schools Head Teachers Association said the move may not be practical. The association said there was no consultation nor official communication. Matiang’i said in cases where schools share a compound, there are squabbles and turf wars which tend to compromise teaching and performance. “This will bring harmony and synergy. There will be better use of resources and infrastructure,” he said. Matiang’i said TSC agrees with the plan. But Kepsha officials yesterday said there has been no feud between schools as claimed by the CS. Secretary David Mavuta said 80 per cent of primary and secondary schools in Kenya share compounds and exist harmoniously. “The TSC has said we are head teachers for life. The PS was here and did not raise such an issue,” Mavuta said on the sidelines of 13th primary heads annual meet in Mombasa. Head teachers are apprehensive if the directive is enforced, their jobs will be sacrificed for their secondary school counterparts to lead. But this will go contrary to an assurance by the TSC about job security of head teachers. TSC chief executive officer Nancy Macharia and chairperson Lydia Nzomo have said the commission will not demote head teachers. â€‹Mavuta said if it is a must for Matiangi’s directive to be followed, secondary heads should be subordinate because all primary schools donated land to secondary schools.      “â€‹â€‹We have given them land, how can you come and make me your deputy?” He asked.
