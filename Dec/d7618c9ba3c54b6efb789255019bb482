Kisii TSC director Nimrod Kimathi on Friday  said the handing over by transferred
secondary school principals in the region has been smooth. “The region has not
experienced any problems since the ministry and the Teachers Service Commission implemented the transfers,” he told the Star on the phone. His remarks comes
three days after teachers' unions and sponsors claimed they were not
consulted.  Kisii
Catholic Diocese Bishop Joseph Mairura said the Church sponsors 145
secondary schools, but the ministry and the TSC did not bother to consult them. He said he learnt
about the transfers of principals from the
media. Knut secretary general
Wilson Sossion has said he will rally teachers to down
their tools if the ministry and the TSC will not rescind the decision. Kuppet national secretary
for secondary schools Edward Obwocha said it was wrong for the ministry
and the TSC to effect mass transfers without consulting major stakeholders.
