Sex for fish has been identified as the root cause of the high HIV and Aids prevalence in Budalang’i, which currently stands at 8.2 per cent above the national rate of 5.0 per cent. The remark was made by Busia county Trade director Ashikoye Abwalaba speaking to Bunyala North ward residents during a public participation forum held at the Mudembi trading centre on Thursday. Present was acting Bunyala subcounty administrator Monica Obinda.  Ashikoye said the high HIV prevalence in Budalang’i constituency is a cause for concern in the entire county. He said there is an urgent need for stakeholders to embark on a marathon sensitisation programme for youths at the grassroots level on the effects of HIV and Aids. “Sex for fish on major beaches along the shores of Lake Victoria in Port Victoria is the root cause of the high HIV-Aids prevalence rate in Budalang’i. I want to appeal to civil society organisations and other stakeholders to volunteer and sensitise the youth on HIV and Aids,” Ashikoye said.  He appealed to the youth to refrain from engaging in irresponsible sexual practices. Ashikoye said irresponsible sex is a major challenge which, unless urgent action is taken to sort out, “is likely to send many people to the grave prematurely”. In 2015, fishermen in Nyatike subcounty called for more efforts to stop the alarming HIV prevalence. They said fishermen and traders should get civic education to help reduce high infection rates among themselves. Peter Gwengi, the executive director of Lake Victoria Initiatives, said projects started to stop the menace had failed. He said it is unfortunate that women are forced to “exchange sex for fish”. Speaking to fishermen on Muhuru Bay Beach, Gwengi said the “sex for fish” culture is deeply rooted in the area.
