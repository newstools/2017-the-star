The Mombasa County Assembly has shifted its focus to the swearing-in of NASA leader Rala Odinga as the People’s President. This follows adoption of the People’s Assembly motion on Wednesday. Yesterday, MCA Moses Aran, who moved the motion, said many residents will be part of a one-million-supporter march during Raila’s “inauguration” on Tuesday. Governor Hassan Joho’s spokesperson Richard Chacha (pictured) said the constitution of the People’s Assembly would take effect. “Members of this assembly will be tasked to swear in Raila,” he said on the phone. Aran said they fear nothing. This comes after the government warned the action amounts to “high treason punishable by death”.  AG Githu Muigai said Raila and those who will give the oath will face the repercussions. But Aran said nothing will be done outside the Constitution, so “there is nothing to fear”.
