 Do you have any idle land? If you do, prepare to pay tax or agree with the government’s plan to use it to produce food.  The government targets idle public and private land to boost food production in the next five years. Agriculture CS Willy Bett yesterday said they have identified more than 60,000 acres of public land to be used under a public-private partnership arrangement. “The government will work with relevant authorities in charge of land, with a view to developing and enacting new laws that will also allow private idle land to be converted into agricultural prodiuction centres,” he said. Bett expressed concern that the country struggles to feed itself, yet there is a huge chunk of arable land lying idle in various regions.
