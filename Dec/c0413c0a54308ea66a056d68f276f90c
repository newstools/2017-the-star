Parents have been asked to closely monitor their teenage children after reports of bhang peddling in parts of Elgeyo Marakwet. The peddlers are said to be selling the bhang to schoolchildren and those who have completed KCPE and KCSE exams. Keiyo North police boss Mwenda Meme said he will investigate the drug peddling racket. Meme said investigative agencies have been put on high alert to arrest culprits selling the banned drug in Iten. The county government raised the red flag on Wednesday after parents complained of bizarre behaviour by teenagers. They promised to work with police to bring to book suspected bhang peddlers. Elgeyo Marakwet Governor Alex Tolgos on Thursday said the youth will be educated on the dangers of using drugs.
