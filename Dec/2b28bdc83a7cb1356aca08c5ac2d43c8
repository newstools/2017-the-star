Athi River deputy county commissioner Geoffrey Omoding yesterday urged the Machakos government to urgently address Mavoko residents’ complaints on dilapidated roads. He said the public outcry on the roads are genuine, hence the need for immediate intervention. “The county government should intervene to end the stalemate between truck drivers and residents,” Omoding said. Residents of Kamulu in Mavoko have barricaded most of the roads used by trucks from quarries in Muthwani ward. They complain of poor state of the roads, which have been destroyed by the heavy trucks, and too much dust. The residents protested on Saturday. They demanded all the roads tarmacked before they reopen them. The trucks now pass on private land, whose owners charge between Sh50 and Sh200 for each trip per lorry.
