Former Kirinyaga Senator Daniel Karaba on Friday suffered a major blow in his quest to have the election of his successor annulled. A court rejected his application to have votes recounted. Justice Abigail Muchila ruled that there was no evidence adduced to warrant a recount. She said Karaba, his witnesses and JP’s agent did not request a recheck or recount when the votes were counted and tallied. The court also observed that the margin between the petitioner and Senator Charles Kibiru was so huge it would not make any difference even if a recount were allowed in selected polling stations. Muchila said the application lacked merit and dismissed it with costs. In Ndia, results of 33 polling stations were disputed. Kibiru beat Karaba by more than 3,000 votes. The court found that there were no bases for recounts in four constituencies, as the petitioner’s concerns had been addressed when the case was heard. Karaba’s lawyer Kibe Mungai said the ruling put the case into jeopardy because the petition hinged on a recount. He said he did not see the need to do a final submission because the court had already pronounced itself. Mungai said he would appeal the decision. It’s hypocritical to tell the petitioner to file a final submission when the ruling is like a final judgment, he said. Muchila directed the parties to file their final submissions on January 8. The last submission has been scheduled for January 10.
