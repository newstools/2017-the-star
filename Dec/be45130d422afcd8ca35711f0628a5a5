The opposition’s push to establish a People’s Assembly in their strongholds is a recipe for chaos, a Jubilee legislator has said. Kuria East MP Marwa Kitayama said assemblies that have approved the motions, including Migori, risk creating trouble in their counties. Including Migori, 12 other assemblies have passed the motion, with Machakos and Mombasa being the latest entrants. Kitayama told the Star in Migori town on Friday the assemblies may turn against the county leadership. “The assemblies will not only hold the national government and Jubilee Party to open criticism but will precipitate chaos and confusion in the counties, hurting development,” he said. Kitayama said NASA leader Raila Odinga (pictured) has created confusion as assemblies which have passed the motion do so to please him, not to help the public.
