Subsequently, mobile penetration rose 1.7 percentage points to reach 90.4 per cent, from 88.7 per cent recorded during the previous quarter. The authority attributed the rapid growth of Telkom subscribers to the customer acquisition campaign they carried out in mid-2017 following its rebranding from Orange Kenya to Telkom Kenya.
