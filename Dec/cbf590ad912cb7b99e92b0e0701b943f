NASA’s motion to form a People’s Assembly suffered another setback yesterday after the Nairobi assembly refused to allocate time for debate. Minority chief whip and Makongeni MCA Peter Imwatok now has twice failed to give a notice of motion. The House Business Committee, which allocates time for debate, cited an injunction issued on November 20 by the High Court in Kitui. It temporarily restrains all county assemblies from passing or implementing motions on formation of People’sAssemblies. This is pending determination of a case filed by the Counties Development Group lobby. Some assemblies have disregarded the order and adopted the opposition-driven motion. “They [House Business Committee] have told me to give them time to verify the authenticity of the court order we were served with,” Imwatok said yesterday. He also said, however, that he would not allow debate, even if there were no court order. In the draft motion seen by the Star, the People’s Assembly is described as a remedy to electoral and other injustices suffered by Kenyans. “A People’s Assembly will be formed to discuss and determine affairs of the country and recommend a path to achieve the promise, aspiration, objectives and rights and freedoms provided by the Constitution,” it says. The Makongeni MCA argued President Uhuru Kenyatta was not validly elected on October 26 because of the low voter turnout. NASA chief Raila Odinga withdraw and called for a boycott by his supporters.  Imwatok will have troubleconvincing the Jubilee-dominated House to approve the motion. “We hava strategy to ensure this goes through,” he said. Jubilee has 65 members, NASA has 58.  The MCAs are to break for recess today and resume sittings in February.
