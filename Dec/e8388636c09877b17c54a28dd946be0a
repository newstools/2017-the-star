Starring: Adam Scott, Craig Robinson, Ally Walker, Adeel Akhtar, Amber Stevens West Directed by:  Tom Gormican/ Kevin Etten  Premier date:  October 1   Max is a disgraced theoretical physicist who was fired from Stanford University when he claimed his wife was abducted by aliens. Max end up working in a book store until one day he’s also abducted by someone. Leroy is also a disgraced former police officer whose partner was killed in the line of duty. He is fired from the force as he is held responsible for his partner’s death.  Leroy ends up working as a mall cop and he also gets abducted. As it turns out, because Leroy and Max have had brushes with paranormal activities, they are recruited by an organisation called the Bureau Underground, which investigates paranormal activities. The two are partnered up by the Captain of the Bureau to find a missing agent. When the agent is taken by the aliens into their spaceship, the duo decide to stay and work for the bureau. In short, Ghosted is like a fusion of Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Men in Black and Parks and Recreation. Which says a lot because Craig Robinson plays a recurring role in Brooklyn Nine-Nine and Adam Scott was a series regular in Parks and Recreation. So take those characters from their shows, put them together add a supernatural plot and voila! You have Ghosted. That is to say, the show is not really bringing anything new to the table in terms of story and comedy.  However, the one thing they got right was to bring together these amazing comedic artistes. Scott and Robinson have an amazing on-screen chemistry; which seems to be the only thing saving the show at the moment. The show is steadily finding its footing — after the disastrous pilot. Hopefully within these 16 episodes, the show will be worthy of Scott’s and Robinson’s performances.   Star Rating:
