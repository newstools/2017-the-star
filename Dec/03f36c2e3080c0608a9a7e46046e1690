We thank former Prime Minister Raila Odinga for withdrawing from his dangerous scheme of being sworn in as Kenya’s 'People’s President' by the so-called 'People’s Assembly' in Mombasa county. Raila finally listened to the voices of reason of religious leaders, diplomats and other assorted peacemakers. Swearing oneself in as president has a tragic history in Africa. In 1994 Moshood Abiola declared himself the lawful president of Nigeria shortly after a trip to win the support of the international community. Two hundred police vehicles took him into custody for four years and he died under suspicious circumstances on his day of release. In 2011, Étienne Tshisekedi was a candidate for president of Congo that he officially lost to incumbent Joseph Kabila. Tshisekedi declared himself the “elected president” of Congo. He was placed under unofficial house arrest. Raila raised a number of fundamental and genuine issues about presidential elections in Kenya that must be addressed well before the next election cycle in 2022.
