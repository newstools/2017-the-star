 A court in Kwale on Thursday acquitted two foreigners charged with the murder of a British soldier in Diani in 2013. Kwale chief magistrate Doreen Mulekyo said there was not enough evidence to convict Thomas Sollacher and Edardo Vasta - both British nationals - for the killing of John Marley.  Marley, who was serving in the British army training unit in Nanyuki, died in the Diani Marine Park after touching a faulty switch in his hotel room on April 26, 2013.  Sollacher was CEO of the hotel and Vasta was the diving instructor.  They were both charged with causing the death of Marley. Sollacher was charged with unlawfully neglecting to repair a bedside lounge at the hotel room where Marley stayed. 15 witnessed testified in the case.  “The prosecution failed to prove the charges against the accused persons beyond reasonable doubt and acquits them of the charges,” Muleyko said.
