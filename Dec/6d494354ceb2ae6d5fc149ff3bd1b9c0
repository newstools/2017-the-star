President Uhuru Kenyatta should vacate office as NASA prepares to swear in Raila Odinga as the head of state tomorrow, Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu has said. She said Uhuru lost fair and square square to Raila during the August 8 General Election. "Whoever lost the election should go home, and whoever won should occupy State House and run the country. On the December 12, the winner will be be sworn into office," Ngilu said. The governor said she would be a key speaker during the swearing-in. Ngilu spoke on Saturday in Nthongoni, Kitui, during the burial of Jeremiah Kisangau. He is the father of the Kitui county assembly Minority leader John Kisangau. She said Kenya was hurting because Uhuru, who was sworn in on November 28, did not win the election. "The country is hurting because we know that the person who took the Bible and swore (as President) did not win the election. He should not have done that. For that reason, we should continue reminding Uhuru Kenyatta that he was defeated by Raila Amolo Odinga," Ngilu said. She praised Raila as the man who has the capacity to take Kenya forward. Ngilu said he is justified to be the President. She said calls for peace were useless since Kenyans are suffering. They lack food, poverty is rampant and quality education is inadequate. "We do not want be told about peace. What kind of peace? Peace without food, peace in poverty, peace without education, peace with women trekking fr long distances in search water. How can we be told of peace when the high and mighty are eating while the lowly are suffering? That is a big No. Keep that peace to yourself. God will help us all," she said. Ngilu said time has come to put the country first and not one or two people in power. "How can it be possible for two people can lead a country of 42 million people, excluding other leaders? They are leading badly," she said.
