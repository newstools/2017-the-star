National Olympic Committee of Kenya( Nock) president Paul Tergat has called on gederations to select their best sportsmen during the trials ahead of the next year Commonwealth Games to be staged in Gold Coast, Australia.  Tergat said for the country to surpass their last performance in Glasgow, Scotland in 2014, where Kenya won 25 medals in total (10 gold, 10 silver and fivebronze), the federations must pick their best. The legendary long distance runner said their mandate is to ensure the country bags as many medals as possible. Tergat said they will not be going to Gold Coast for holiday. “I call on all the federations to conduct competitive trials and come up with outstanding sportsmen who will do the country proud. We all are aware and know how sports bring this nation together and therefore let the federations field their best participants,” said Tergat.  He noted that they are doing everything possible to avoid similar events of the 2016 Summer Olympic Games. “For now, we are working on logistics. We want our participants to have everything in place before the event unlike Rio Olympics,” noted Tergat. For this to happen, Tergat said various federations should work in unison for the betterment of the sport and more so for the Commonwealth Games to be a success. Tergat also called on the athletes to shun performance-enhancing drugs, saying the vice has really killed the morale in sports across the world. He said: “I shared the same sentiments on drugs during the recent International Sports Press Association (AIPS) event in Nairobi tand I want to reiterate the same.I am glad the Government through Anti Doping Agency Kenya are being robust on the issue and within no time, we will start afresh and win titles free and fair.”
