Ten people died on Saturday night after a matatu and truck collided in Makutano near the Eldama Ravine junction. Three people sustained serious injuries and were rushed to Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret. Eldama Ravine subcounty medical officer Sheila Mwaruka said despite efforts to respond to the situation, the lack of a CT scanner made treatment difficult. “We don’t have a CT scan [machine] to check the damage. So, we referred victims to the MTRH,” she said. About 150 people have died in road accidents this month. More than 30 people died on Jamhuri Day after a multiple crash involving 15 vehicles in Sachang’wan. The night before, a family of 19 died in another multiple crash at Mfupi Bridge in Bungoma. The NTSA dismissed claims its officers were to blame for the Sachang’wan accident. Director general Francis Meja lastTuesday said his officers were being crucified for their diligent work. It was said NTSA officers were pursuing the driver of a trailer that lost control. The driver reportedly refused to stop at a roadblock before the trailer’s brakes failed, resulting in the accident. Eighteen people also died in a grisly road accident on the Marigat-Loruk road in Baringo on December 9. The accident involved an AP truck transporting police and civilians to Kapedo from Marigat town. Baringo North subcounty police boss Sheh Mohamed said the lorry overturned as the driver attempted to avoid hitting some goats crossing the road at Sibilo Lions, about two kilometres from Loruk trading centre. “Those who died on the spot are 10 women, three male adults and one child below 10 years. About 18 were seriously injured,”  Sheh said.
