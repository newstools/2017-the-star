Greensharks have a chance to topple second-placed Butali Sugar Warrior when they face Kenya College of Accountancy University in a Kenya Hockey Union Premier League match at the City Park Stadium, tomorrow. Sharks are third on the standings with 49 points from 25 matches and a win against the students will move them to second with 52 points one better of Warriors who are not in action this weekend. At the same time, on-form Kenya Police will seek to extend their lead at the top of the standings when they tackle sixth-placed Nairobi Sikh Union.  The law enforcers have 67 points from 24 matches having lost just one match against Western Jaguars last weekend. However, the 2013 champions recovered to comprehensively whip relegated Technical University of Kenya 7-0 and inch closer to reclaiming the title.  Police coach Kenneth Kaunda said only six points stand between them and the title and called on his charges to finish on a high. “It is our trophy to lose with only four games left. We just need to win two of our remaining four ties to clinch the 2017 title. But for now, we want to remain focused and ensure we are at our best,” said Kaunda.
