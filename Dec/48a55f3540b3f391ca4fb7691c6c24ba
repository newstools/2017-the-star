Two suspects who were importing illicit brew into the country were arrested on Wednesday night by police and KRA officials in Eldoret. They were found transporting the liquor from Uganda to Eldoret and Nakuru. Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago said the return of illicit brews and alcohol is ruining the lives of many youths in the North Rift. Eldoret West police boss Samwel Mutunga said the two were arrested on the Busia-Eldoret highway. Police also impounded two Probox cars ferrying illicit alcohol valued at more than Sh600,000. Mutunga said the suspects are part of a group that had planned to distribute the alcohol in Western Kenya during the Christmas season.  The impounded consignment labelled “Uganda Waragi” was packaged in sachets. “The suspects are dangerous because they operate without identification and they have been trying to kill our officers whenever they are stopped. They have been on the run,” Mutunga said. He said owners of wines and spirits outlets have been colluding with the smugglers. KRA official Daniel Wanyoike on Thursday said they are working with police to stop supply of the alcohol in the Rift Valley. Wanyoike said KRA officials will increase patrols along the highways.
