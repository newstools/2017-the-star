Kenya National Paralympic Committee (KNPC) will host the World Para swimming Championships from February 8-11 at Moi, Kasarani. The event will run alongside a training camp for 50 athletes and coaches from various African countries in ahead of the bonanza. The camp has attracted International classifiers, educators and technical officials. Event organiser, Joe Muniafu said: “This is a very unique opportunity for the athletes and citizens living with disabilities in Kenya and who have to not only live with the stigma of disability but also bear with the many disadvantages and lack of privileges that other able-bodied athletes and citizens enjoy.”  He said the event is a blessing for swimmers with disabilities who have been greatly disadvantaged for their inability to travel to far-flung countries due to the huge financial outlay that is required for such trips.  “ This also presents an opportunity for various government agencies, corporates and private citizens to partner with KNPC to support athletes during the event on home soil and for our nation to showcase the Kenyan legendary hospitality and sportsmanship,” he said. Muniafu revealed that Chandaria Foundation has been very generous and have come on board as co-sponsors. “We hope the other partners will step up to provide the support required to deliver a successful event. The Rotary Club will host a swim marathon on February 4 at Kasarani Aquatic Centre.  The fund-raiser event will serve as the launch of the week-long activities leading up to the championships. Funds raised from the swim marathon will be shared between various Rotary Club charities.
