Three time London marathon champion Mary Keitany asserted her dominance in marathon running by setting a new world record in a vintage year for Kenyan athletes. Keitany clocked 2:17:01 in London, slicing one minute and 36 seconds off her previous PB, also set in London for a win five years earlier. The 35-year-old Kenyan was 41 seconds faster than Paula Radcliffe’s previous record from her victory in 2005. In her second marathon of the season, the 2009 world half-marathon champion was beaten in New York where Shalane Flanagan grabbed the first win by a US woman since Miki Gorman’s victory in 1977. Edna Kiplagat was recently crowned as world marathon majors winner adding a remarkable feat to the World Championships silver medal she won in London in (2:27:18), losing out to Kenyan-born Bahraini Rose Chelimo (2:27:11). Kiplagat, 38, had earlier won the titles in 2011 and 2013. USA’s 33-year-old Amy Cragg just lost to Kiplagat in a sprint finish, but earned her first major medal, a bronze, timed at 2:27:18. Joycline Jepkosgei also rose to prominence in a stellar year. The 24-year-old had personal bests of just 1:09:07 for the half marathon and 31:08 for 10km at the start of the year, meaning the African 10,000m bronze medallist was still relatively unknown heading into the season. But after the Prague Half Marathon in April, everyone in the athletics world suddenly became aware of her. Jepkosgei led through 10km in the Czech capital in a world record of 30:04 before going on to set world records at 15km (45:37) and 20km (1:01:25) before crushing the half marathon world record with 1:04:52, the first sub-65-minute performance in history by a woman. Later in the year, Jepkosgei headed to Valencia and shaved a further second off her world half marathon record. Her opening pace was more conservative than it was in Prague, but only slightly; she passed 10km in 30:07, 15km in 45:57 and 20km in 1:01:28. By the finish line, though, she was back on world record schedule and won in 1:04:51. Olympic marathon champion Eliud Kipchoge attempt at breaking the world record in th event failed to materiliase but ended the year as the man to bat in the 42 kilometer event. Kipchoge won this year’s Berlin in a world-leading 2:03:32, he was shadowed almost all the way to the finish line by unheralded marathon novice Guye Adola. In May, Kipchoge with sponsor Nike had attempted to break the two-hour barrier at the Monza racetrack but came up short, posting 2:00:25 In other notable events, Geoffrey Kirui who won the Boston marathon in May bagged the World championship in London edging out Ethiopia’s Tamirat Tola over the last third of the race.  At the World cross country championships in Kampala, Uganda, defending champion Geoffrey Kamworor retained his title after posting 28:24 with Leonard Barsoton second in 28:36 and Ethiopia’s Abadi Hadis third in 28:43 In the women’s category, Irene Cheptai (31:57) led Kenyan 1-2-3 with Alice Aprot (32:01) and Lillian Rengeruk (32:11). Kenya got the two top medals individually while Ethiopia took the team title by one point (21 vs 22) thanks to a more compact team. The overall East African domination was as strong as ever with 31 of the top 32 – Australian Pat Tiernan in 13th being the only exception – born in that region.
