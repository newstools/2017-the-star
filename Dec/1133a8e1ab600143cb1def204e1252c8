Sirisia MP John Waluke says the Luhya community has identified a running mate for Deputy President William Ruto in 2022. He said the community is working on a plan to unify under Jubilee before the next general election. Although Waluke did not name the candidate, sources said it may be Water CS Eugene Wamalwa or former Budalang'i MP Ababu Namwamba. "We are sure Ruto will be the next president and as Luhyas we are targeting the number two slot," he said on Saturday.

Waluke said he is aiming to be Bungoma governor in 2022 after serving as MP for two terms. Separately, a section of Gema leaders said they will front Devolution CS Mwangi Kiunjuri as Ruto's running mate. "He has also proved to be an effective servant of the people, considering how he has performed since he joined the cabinet," said organising secretary Paul Kinyanjui. He said Kiunjuri is the senior most politician in Mt Kenya region capable of taking over the leadership mantle from Uhuru. Kinyanjui said the CS has represented the interest of Gema community members. "We are asking Ruto that God-willing, he should consider Kiunjuri as a possible running mate," the secretary said. Kiunjuri has in the recent past faced criticism from a section of Central Kenya leaders who say that the CS should not be retained in Uhuru's cabinet. But Kinyanjui has defended the Cabinet Secretary's performance, saying those opposed to him are "envious that he is a rising star".
