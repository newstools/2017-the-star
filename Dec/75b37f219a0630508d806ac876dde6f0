Hopes for two families whose kin perished in the lake Nakuru chopper crash continue to diminish as teams gradually pull out of the recovery operation. More than 40 drivers who have been combing the waters have been slowly pulling out of the exercise leaving two KWS boats at the scene. National Disaster Operation Centre officer Jonathan Kertich confirmed the divers had left the Lake . Families of Sam Gita and John Mapozi, whose bodies are yet to be retrieved from Lake Nakuru have been camping on the shores. It has been 61 days since the helicopter crashed into the lake, killing all the five on board. The families and friends have been camping in Lake Nakuru National Park, praying that the bodies will be retrieved and given a decent burial. Other occupants were Anthony Kipyegon, pilot Apollo Malowa and a lady friend, Veronica Muthoni. The chopper crashed moments after take-off from Jarika Hotel, Nakuru. The bodies of Malowa, Kipyegon and Muthoni were retrieved and buried. A combined force of Kenya Navy, Kenya Police, Kenya Wildlife Service, Kenya Forest Service and divers from Naivasha has been conducting the search since the incident happened. “We have been camping on the shores of the lake hoping our loved ones’ bodies will be rescued. We are helpless. We can only wait and see if the recovery will be successful,” said Gitau’s father William Mwangi.
