Among contentious issues expected to be highlighted in the new CBA will be Education CS Fred Matiang'i's directive to put lecturer's and other university academic staff on contract and non-pensionable employment. The matter has been criticised by the union, citing it was ill-informed. Speaking to the Star, UASU secretary general Constantine Wasonga said the meeting is one of the agendas set out during the crafting of the return-to-work formula that marked an end to the 38-day strike on December 8. “We will be engaging the IPPUCF on a number of issues, among them the push for the implementation of the pending internal 2013-17 CBA for individual universities, which we agreed will be completed before end of February next year,” he said. The meeting will further deliberate on the payment of the accrued pension, which stands at Sh4 billion. The university pension scheme is contributory with the employer contributing 20 per cent and the employee contributing 10 per cent to the scheme. Wasonga said most universities have failed to remit the money. "We want to streamline the higher education sector so we will not be burdened with the frequent strikes as witnessed in the last few years as we demand better pay or working conditions," he said.
