All aspirants in the Kitui West by-election must have a degree. The seat fell vacant after MP Francis Nyenze died on Wednesday morning. The requirement that MPs should have degrees had been suspended in the Election Laws until after the August General Election. This means aspirants in any by-election that will be held between now and the 2022 must be university graduates. Afterward, all must hold degrees. This requirement sparked widespread protests, as quite a few lawmkers hold degrees. Previously, the law only required the President, Deputy President, governors and deputy governors to hold degrees from recognised universities. The Constitution and County Government Act do not specify academic qualifications for MCAs. But the law says in case of a by-election, MCA aspirants need a post-secondary school diploma and a degree for the 2022 poll. Meanwhile, Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka and his National Assembly counterpart Justin Muturi yesterday paid tributes to Nyenze. The leaders described him as a peacemaker who spoke his mind on any matter. Muturi said Parliament has lost a vibrant member. “On behalf of all Members of the National Assembly and the Parliamentary Service Commission and indeed on my own behalf, I take this opportunity to condole with the family of the late Francis, the people of Kitui West Constituency and his friends for the loss of this great legislator at this trying moment,”Muturi said. On his part, Lusaka said Nyenze was a gentleman and an astute leader who will always be remembered for his sound development record, hard work and good demeanor .  National Assembly Majority leader Aden Duale and his Minority counterpart John Mbadi said Nyenze’s contributed alot in the last Parliament.
