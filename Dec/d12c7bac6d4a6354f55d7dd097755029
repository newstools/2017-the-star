Technology firm Google has unveiled a new mobile application to help internet users understand, control and save mobile data. This is after a global research that revealed user concerns on data consumption on their smartphones. “Not only are smartphone users constantly thinking about data balances, they do not understand where their data is going, nor do they feel like they can control allocating data to the apps they really care about,” Google Kenya country manager Charles Murito said.  The app includes a data saver that controls data on an app-by-app basis, so that data only goes to apps users care about, and a data saver bubble that appears when a user goes into an app. Whenever that app uses data, the data saver bubble will show the current rate of data usage, and users can easily choose to block that app’s data use if things start to get out of control. Other features are personalized alerts that tell users when apps start consuming a lot of data, and it allows them to see how much data they’ve used on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis, and a Wi-Fi finder that reveals the networks nearby, rated by the Datally community. Once connected, users can rate the Wi-Fi networks themselves based on their own experience.
