Mount Kenya University students and other officials on Christmas Day visited inmates at the King’ong’o Prison in Nyeri and cooked more than 2,000 chapatis. MKU marketing coordinator Daniel Mwangi said the students and other stakeholders contributed Sh130,000 to ensure the prisoners join others Kenyans in celebrating the festivities.  He said the university also donated 300 rolls of toilet papers, 120 pieces of toothpaste and bar soaps to the inmates. Mwangi was accompanied by Margaret Wamuyu, a counselor and a lecturer. “The inmates should know they have been physically jailed, but not their brains. Authors like Ngugi wa Thiong’o and John Kiriamiti became wealthy after writing their books inside prisons,” Wamuyu said. Meanwhile, Nyeri Town MP Ngunjiri Wambugu, politicians Wambugu Nyamu, Wachira Keen and Eric Makara joined Nyeri street families on Christmas Day, where they shared a meal. Ngunjiri promised to ensure the children are rehabilitated and accommodated in children’s homes in the constituency. In Gataragwa ward, Kieni West, MCA Clement Warutere visited more than 50 families and donated food.
