Kenyan professional golfers will be returning to the South African Open Championship slated for early next year. South Africa-based Stefan Andersen and long-hitting Mumias professional, Dismas Indiza are among those expected to grace the championship, one of the oldest national open golf tournaments in the world. It is also one of the principal tournaments on the Sunshine Tour, co-sanctioned by the European Tour since 1997. The duo will be using the event as part of their preparations for the 2018 Barclays Kenya Open. Indiza, however, called on sponsors and well wishers to help him realise his goal of gracing the event. “I have an invitation already but I will truly be banking on sponsors to help me attend the event. I intend to do a few rounds of the Sunshine Tour if sponsorship comes through. This will be my build up ahead of the 2018 Kenya Open. Considering that the Kenya Open features some very tough and refined pros, it’s always a pleasure approaching it with a positive mind and indeed some good form,” said Indiza, who made the cut in the 2017/edition of the local open. Meanwhile, Kenyan pro Nelson Mudanyi has landed an invite to play in Seychelles. Mudanyi who couldn’t divulge the details of his invite said he is keen to make a cut in the Kenya Open next year hence prior overseas preparations. “I will definitely not be traveling to the South African Open but I’m overly excited and indeed enthusiastic of the Seychelles invite. I received a call from Seychelles a few days ago and hope to establish finer details of the tour in a few days. But for every aspiring golfer, it’s always a pleasure going out there on a golfing tour,” said Mudanyi, elder brother to Edwin Mudanyi, who won the Kenya Amateur Golf Championship (formerly the GOTY).
