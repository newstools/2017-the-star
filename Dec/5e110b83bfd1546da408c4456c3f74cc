A group of women in Kilifi county has urged the government to protect them from land-grabbers in the event their husbands’ die. The women said they are denied their right to own land because of their culture, which states they are not supposed to inherit property when their spouses die. Widows end up being kicked out of their homes with their children. The women raised the issue during a presentation to the county assembly Committee on Lands in Malindi on Sunday. A delegation of 100 women attended the conference. Terevenia Mwamburi, the chairperson of the Malindi Rights Forum, said the problem is rampant in Magarini subcounty. She said this has contributed to an increase in the number of squatters as women are forced to abandon their husband’s homes and begin their lives afresh.
