Police are mapping out zones perceived "dangerous" as international and local tourists flock the Coast for Christmas festivities. Guests attending various conferences, including the ongoing primary heads annual meeting in Mombasa, have been assured of safety. On Saturday, regional commissioner Nelson Marwa said “security will be doubled” and “intelligence gathering stepped up”. Terror threats and any form of violence have always remained a reality during the festivities, because of the huge number of people. Targets have been beaches, restaurants, clubs and places of worship. “The region has been peaceful during the electioneering period. The only challenge now is how to maintain it,” Marwa said. “We must not allow anarchy in this region.” Last December, IG Joseph Boinnet said terror threat is still alive after al Shaabab threatened a retaliatory attack. Marwa said tourism has picked and hotels are full, owing to the zero attack or upheavals. “We want to sustain that. Tourism is the economic backbone of this region. Hotels are reinstating the sacked staff,” he said. The administrator said the government will invest on security, because without it, “investment will not thrive”. He said no tankers will be seen on the streets as expected by many. Police tanks, water cannons jammed major streets during electioneering period. They were meant to curb violence. “This month will be the busiest for Coast. Visitors worldwide and locally will be trooping and we must guarantee them that they will be secure,” Marwa said. Most public facilities have been on the spot for relaxing security alertness.
