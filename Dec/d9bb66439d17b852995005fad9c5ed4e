Farmers in Kambu county have complained about the poor quality of animal feed sold to them.  Deputy Governor James Nyoro yesterday warned the
government will make impromptu visits to the local manufacturers to inspect how they make the feeding. Farmers, especially dairy ones, are frustrated as they are making losses. The costly feed do not increase production. “Our aim is to ensure the farmers feed their animals the
best quality feeds that will increase production. Without an increased
production, our farmers will never enjoy their hard work,” Nyoro said. “We shall check the ingredients, especially the nutritive
value, and ensure they sell it at an affordable price.”   He was speaking at Gikambura Dairy Farmers' Society Ltd
in Kikuyu constituency where he handed over a 2,000 litre milk cooler. Nyoro was with Karai MCA Samuel Mugwanja, society chairman Henry Ndung’u and shareholders.
