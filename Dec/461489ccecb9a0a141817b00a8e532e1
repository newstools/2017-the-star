It was all colourful on Tuesday last week as Uhuru Kenyatta was
sworn in at the Kasarani Stadium for his second
term. Top artistes, including award-winning
singers Rufftone, Emmy Kosgei and Size 8, entertained those who
had attended the inauguration function. The Mateke
hitmaker Size 8 took to the stage to entertain the crowd, and she had just
started singing her second song, Tam Tam, when all hell broke loose. Before
the crowd could even join in the singing, her performance was cut short, leaving her followers' tongues wagging and thinking she was not
entertaining or rather she had chosen the wrong song for the day. Speaking to Word Is, she defended her choice of song. She said, "I did not perform, I ministered to the people. And God was there and the people were happy. Sikuona
coz I have been busy," she said. Adding: "Everyone is entitled to speak what
they want, but for me, I engaged the crowd. My purpose was to engage with
my fans and if people found it funny or whatever, my intention was to
engage and celebrate the good doing of the Lord. I can't judge people
vibaya, I guess it's because they had not seen my earlier performance.
Anyway I had fun and I was so happy."
