 Former Governor Evans Kidero has said his successor Mike Sonko is claiming credit for projects he initiated at City Hall. Speaking on the phone yesterday, Kidero said the Sh1.3 billion data centre at City Hall that President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto launched on Monday was his brainchild. “Actually, by the time I was leaving City Hall, the data centre was complete. I negotiated in 2014 with the World Bank, which agreed to fund it,” he said. Kidero cited the automation of revenue collection, setting up of the data centre and development of the Integrated Development Plan as some of the projects he initiated. “Now he has embraced eJijiPay, but during his campaigns he stated categorically that he would terminate contract with JamboPay,” he said. Kidero contracted JamboPay in 2014 who automated 14 of 136 revenue streams, among them parking fees, rates and single business permits.
