This was not the vintage performance that fans have come to expect from Paul Put’s Harambee Stars but at least it was good enough to seal the host a place in the last four of the ongoing Cecafa Senior Challenge Cup.  The 1-0 victory over already ousted Tanzanian Mainland was not pretty in the eyes of the fans at the Machakos Stadium but it was enough for Kenya to sail to the all important knockout stage of a competition that they must win.  Vincent Ouma’s strike 20 minutes into the do-or-die encounter for Kenya was enough to seal a berth against either Uganda or Burundi as Put’s decision to start with a largely experimental strike force paid off. Kariobangi Sharks live wire Ovella Ochieng was the man of the match with his darting runs and ability to take advantage of opponents in small spaces nothing short of amazing. It was his cross that led to Kenya’s opener as the dangerous left foot of Ouma did the magic. Despite the host enjoying most of the possession, Kilimanjaro Stars landed a couple of chances with the best chance ensuing from a cross by Himid Mao on the half-hour mark. In a rather balanced affair, Tanzanians created more chances but none bore fruit. Dennis Sikhayi could have doubled matters for Stars in the 39th minute with a long range shot but his effort veered off target in the last piece of action before the match took a break.  After the breather, a rejuvenated Kilimanjaro Stars came back with more intent in the second half with Ibrahim Ajibu landing the first chance to draw his side level, but Ernest Wendo kept him in check, clearing the danger in the nick of time before he could take a decent shot. It was then George Blackberry Odhiambo with a ferocious shot just outside the box but the Tanzanian keeper kept out the danger. Stars head coach Paul Put made his first change in the 55th minute, bringing in Whyvonne Isuza in place of Chrispin Oduor.
