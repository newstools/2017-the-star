Kisumu Governor Anyang Nyong’o’s political adviser Abala Wanga has accused Senator Fred Outa of playing politics by making ‘nonexistent corruption allegations’ against the current administration. This follows Outa’s allegations against county secretary Olang’o Onudi and Wanga, the former director of administration, concerning the award of Sh200 million road tenders without proper procedure. But in a press conference yesterday, Wanga accused Outa of spreading lies to tarnish the administration’s name. He said the focus should be on uniting the county. Wanga said the national government has not released funds to the county and Outa should focus on pushing for the money to spur development. Disastrous “We have established Outa has formed a belief the administration of Nyong’o is a passing government. He is held hostage by the politics of 2022 with the dream that peddling lies will give him an edge or political mileage for his governorship ambition,” he said. Wanga said the ‘non-factual and baseless attack’ on Nyong’o’s technocrats is an indication of him indirectly declaring his candidature for the governor race in 2022. On Monday, Outa alleged the two officers awarded the tenders at Barcadia Club to their cronies. He urged Nyong’o to take action against them. Outa said the two should step aside for investigations. He said the officers ignored the Public Procurement Act, which requires open tendering to allow qualified people to build roads. Outa said that it would be “disastrous” for the new administration to continue carrying out the ‘corrupt deeds’ witnessed in the past administration. He said Kisumu should be corruption-free.
