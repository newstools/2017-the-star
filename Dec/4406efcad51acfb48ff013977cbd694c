The
controversial Kenya Gazette notice by Labour Cabinet Secretary Phyllis Kandie has triggered adversarial politics in
the union that could lead to a split along political lines.  This
fresh confrontation could augur ill in the union sector early in President
Uhuru Kenyatta’s second and final term. President
Uhuru’s first term featured serial strikes by teachers, lecturers, nurses and
doctors. A number
of questions: Was Attorney General Githu Muigai right in his advisory to the
government, or is this yet again another dubious and questionable opinion? There is
need for the teachers and their leaders – the country’s largest single
workforce – to abide by the law and seek proper interpretation.  Does an
elective union position fall under the "employment" classified and
prohibited by the Constitution, or is it public service? In other
countries, labour and other special interests are represented. Wasn’t Wilson Sossion
in fact nominated to cater to teachers’ special interests? Should
the other elected leaders step down from holding positions such as secretary
general of a football club, if they earn from it? What about a cooperative
society?
