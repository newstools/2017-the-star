Kenya’s chances of reaching the 2019 World Cup qualifiers were dealt a major blow after an eight-wicket loss to Scotland at the ICC World Cricket League Championships in Dubai yesterday. With the win, Scotland clinched a place at the World Cup qualifiers set for Zimbabwe in March next year. The result means Kenya will need to dig deep in their second match against Scotland tomorrow, and hope that Hong Kong lose to Papua New Guinea to see their campaign back on track. Put in to bat, Kenya were bowled out for 146 and watched their opponents bash through to the target with 132 balls to spare. The Kenyan batting once again struggled with none of the batsman showing any sighs of being competitive against the Scots. Collins Obuya was the only batsman in Thomas Odoyo’s lineup to stand the Scottish test with 26 runs from 50 balls. Fast bowler Safyaan Sharif vindicated Scotland’s decision to field at the toss by picking up a wicket in the very first over. Opener Rushab Patel was the first of the procession as four of the top six batsmen were restricted to single digits. Obuya got in the crease in the 10th over with the board on 31 for 2 and get the scores to 95 for 6 in the 32nd by the time he was being dismissed.  The tail did its best to play out the full quota of overs, but they couldn’t handle Sharif ( 3 for 33 ) and Chris Sole ( 2 for 20 ) when they came back in the death overs. Left-arm spinner Mark Watt had a fine day as well, finishing with figures of 10-2-17-1. Half-centuries from captain Kyle Coetzer ( 52 ) and Calum MacLeod  ( 56* ) put the finishing touches on a game Scotland dominated from start to finish. The winners of the World Cricket League Championship also claim the 13th spot in the ODI League, with the Netherlands leading the way.
