An Embu legislator, union boss and county executive have said farmers are unable to produce high quality coffee because of a Sh100 million debt.  Runyenjes MP Erick Muchangi, Embu county Agriculture executive Ann Nyaga and Coffee Mills chairman Muriuki Maruku said most farmers’ earnings go towards paying the loan they took for the construction of a coffee mill in 2014. Muchangi and Maruku, who is also the chairman of the county coffee farmers’ union, and Nyaga said farmers are unable to buy adequate inputs to improve the quality of their coffee. The three said the reason for borrowing the loan to construct the Murue Coffee Mill was to enable farmers add value to their raw beans before selling it to fetch higher prices at the market. They urged the state to waive the debt.
