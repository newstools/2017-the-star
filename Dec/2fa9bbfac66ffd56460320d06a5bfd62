Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi has promised tough times for the Jubilee government in his new job as the PAC chair in a bid to tame corruption. Speaking in Ugenya yesterday, Wandayi said it will not be business as usual for corrupt cartels in government. He blamed the cartels for the country’s slow development. Wandayi said the committee will restore sanity in the use of public funds. “With the government’s attitude towards watchdog institutions, it is a must that we remain vigilant, otherwise devolution and other independent institutions will be killed,” Wandayi said.

Wandayi warned the government against delaying county funds. “If they think that things will remain the same during my tenure, then they are in for a rude shock,” Wandayi said.
