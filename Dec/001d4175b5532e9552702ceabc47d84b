Hotels in Watamu, Kilifi county are expected to be fully booked from December 20, operators have said. They said Italian tourists are among the highest number of visitors to the area. Guido Bertoni, general manager of Garado Beach Resors, said tourists have gained confidence in the sector as elections have ended. "Tourism is picking up ... after election, re-elections and there has been no bad press or riots," he said. He said they have had two Indian weddings in the past week, which are a major attraction.

"If it's expanded, we can have tourists throughout the year," he added. Watamu has over 20 hotels that have a high number of visitors in the festive period. Roberto Macri, general manager of Seven Islands Resort, said investors shifted to Watamu because it is safe, the beaches are clean and people can walk freely. He also noted concerns over the airport's expansion, adding that the distance on road is long.
