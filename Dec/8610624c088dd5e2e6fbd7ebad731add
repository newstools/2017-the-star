Diamond Platnumz' mother, Sanura Kassim, has told off a Kenyan woman, identified as Gladys, who claims she's the singer's baby mama. The 39-year-old mother of two claims to have sired a child with the Utanipenda hitmaker and she wants him to take full responsibility. "I became friends with Diamond Platnumz in 2011 on Facebook. By then, I was working in Saudi Arabia. We met on Facebook and met three years later. He had a show at Sports Club, Eldoret, Kenya, and we had a one-night stand. We didn't use protection and he gave me Sh50,000," she said. In a video that has gone viral, Gladys says she travelled all the way from Eldoret to Tandale, hoping that Diamond Platnumz would accept him and take responsibility of her seven-month-old child. She says she, however, met Sandra, who chased her away, saying her son would never bed a woman like her. The Tanzanian crooner has been involved in scandals for the better part of this year, forcing him to release a song bashing all the women he's been involved with. Well, Diamond Platnumz' mother has told Gladys to keep off her son, claiming she's insane. "Huyo dem ni chizi. Ashakuja hadi nyumbani kwangu," she said during a phone call interview with Ubuyu. Adding, "I can’t talk to a mad person, you will be bewitched if you keep coming for my son."
