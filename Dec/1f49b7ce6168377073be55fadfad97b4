Baringo residents want the government to ensure constant security patrols along the porous Tugen-Pokot borders so they can enjoy a peaceful Christmas. This comes after suspected armed Pokot bandits attacked residents of Yatya and Chemoe in Baringo North on Sunday and stole 38 cows belonging to three Tugen families. “We have never had sleep since then. We are not safe this Christmas season,” politician Joseph Makilap said during Jamhuri Day celebrations in Kabartonjo town on Tuesday. He urged the government to deploy more security officers to patrol the borders to keep off the armed bandits. The bandits fled towards Katikit and Kositei in Tiaty subcounty. Also at the function was Baringo North deputy county commissioner John Tanui, police boss Chemongis Ndiema and subcounty administrator Luka Aengwo. Tanui blamed the Pokot bandits’ cattle rustling on the need for dowry. This is linked to increasing FGM and early marriages. He assured that his security team will ensure the safety of residents. Security officers will pursue the bandits to their hideouts, Tanui said. Click here for the latest political news
