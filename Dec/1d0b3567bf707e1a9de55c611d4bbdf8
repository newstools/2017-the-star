Governor Mike Sonko on Tuesday evening dismissed claims that members belonging to Sonko Rescue Team have not been paid for eight months. Sonko termed the allegations as fake news, saying the team has been paid up all their dues and the genuine volunteers are still working day and night to get the city rid of the garbage menace. There were claims that on Tuesday a section of youths working under Sonko Rescue team staged a demo within the CBD to demand payment for salary arrears. “I want to set the record straight, the Team has no permanent staff but over 4,000 volunteers who do not earn a salary but allowances,” said Sonko. He said some criminals in the team’s uniform, posing as members to commit crime like robbery, extortion and rape might be the ones stage-managing the protests as blackmail. He said volunteers are paid on weekly or daily basis, and documented evidence of all payments.
