Wajir Department of Water Nominee Yussuf Dayib, yesterday told the vetting committee that the county needs to be more innovative in provision of the precious commodity. Dayib said the county needs mega piping projects if it is to end the perennial water problem. "There are over 400 settlements in the county with over 157 of them depending on truck water. It is time we engage in new innovative methods like investing heavily on mega piping projects from boreholes, with ample yield and water harvesting projects for it to be sustainable", Yussuf said. Dayib who has worked at Kenya Bureau of Standards says he is passionate about service delivery especially for Water Department, having been brought up in Tarbaj town, an area which to date has full blown water scarcity with countless boreholes drilling exercise yielding no fruit.  Last week,a group of women from the county moved to court seeking to nullify the nomination of chief officers and their subsequent vetting, citing failure by Governor Mohamed Abdi to meet the two-thirds gender rule. So far the Adhoc committee has vetted over 8 chief officers and has an intention of seeing through the remaining 25 chief officers in the stipulated 3 days scheduled to kick start service delivery. The court issued a directive which bared the Assembly from vetting the nominees until the case is heard and determined. The assembly has however defied the order. Â
