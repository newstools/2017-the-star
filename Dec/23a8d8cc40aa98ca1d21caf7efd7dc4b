The High Court has ordered scrutiny and a recount of votes in 11 polling stations in an election petition against Mandera Senator Mohammed Maalim Mohamud This is after a successful application by Hassan Aden Osman, who lost the race. Justice Francis Tuiyott ordered a recount of votes at Ado Saden, Lanquara, Al-Hidaya Primary School, Olla Primary School and Kubi Primary. Other locations are Olla Primary School, Garsey Primary School, Morothile Primary School, Kalicha Primary School, Korma Adow polling station and Sarman Primary School. The judge said in some polling stations logs and KIEMS kits will be examined to establish whether voting took place. “ICT officers from IEBC will assist under the direction of the deputy registrar,” Tuiyott said. The judge further ordered recounts to be supervised by the deputy registrar of the commercial and Tax Division of High Court in Milimani Law Courts. Each of the parties would appoint a minimum of three agents. The deputy registrar will file her report by January 15. Osman, who garnered 62,769 against Mohamud’s 71,890, claims the election was marred by massive irregularities. He wants Mohamud’s election nullified and a fresh election be held by the IEBC. The petitioner claims there were discrepancies in figures entered in Forms 38A and 37B. Osman filed the petition soon after Mandera Governor aspirant Hassan Noor filed a petition against Governor Ali Roba. He is seeking a repeat of election. Noor argues the governor’s election was marred by irregularities as most of the voters. He said a majority of the voters are illiterate and were misled during voting. Noor claimed some residents were turned away without voting.
