President Uhuru Kenyatta on Satruday urged Kenyans to register as members of National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF) so that they can be able to access medical services.  Uhuru said that through this, Kenyans will not have to worry about hospital costs when they fall sick.  “There is no person who knows when they will require medical services. It would be prudent for all citizens to register themselves with the scheme,” Uhuru said.
