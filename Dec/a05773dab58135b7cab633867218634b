Providing a clean, healthy and secure environment for citizens whose livelihood depends on Lake Victoria should be a priority, Environment PS Charles Sunkuli has said. He said the counties should allocate resources to mitigate pollution in the basin. Sunkuli spoke on Wednesday at Tom Mboya Labour College in Kisumu, where he flagged off five exhausters that cost Sh57million. The exhausters were distributed to Siaya, Nandi, Kericho and Busia counties. Sunkuli said the Lake Victoria Basin is an important and strategic zone for Kenya. “Counties should only engage in projects that reduce the environmental strain in the Lake Victoria Basin and improve the livelihoods of the riparian communities,” he said. Sunkuli said the lake plays a major role in the socioeconomic and ecological stability of the basin. He said the national government in collaboration with counties are committed to addressing pollution.
