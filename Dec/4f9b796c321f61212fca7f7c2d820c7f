Public and private institutions and companies will henceforth be required to employ 70 per cent of locals or face losing their licences. The decision was passed unanimously by the county assembly yesterday. The motion was moved by leader of majority Anthony Ikonya (Kiambu Town). Section 65 ( 1 ) (e) states that in selecting candidates for appointment, the County Public Service Board shall consider the need to ensure that at least 30 per cent of the vacant posts at entry level are filled by candidates who are not from the dominant ethnic community in the county The MCAs said companies and industries violate the law by hiring more outsiders while many locals are unemployed. “I have noted with a lot of concern that Kiambu has been generous to people from outside this county to the extent that we do this at the expense of our very own,” Ikonya said. “An example is Quickmart Supermarket on Kiambu-Thindigua road. There are many youths idling there but those employed are from outside the county yet we provide infrastructure.” MCAs were teargassed when they went to compel a Chinese contractor building a road to employ locals. “We have to legislate to the effect that we do not have to compel people to employ our people, but the law should be followed and [we should] make sure employers comply,” Ikonya said. Ndeiya MCA Gideon Gachara, who seconded the motion, said, “Our people should come first since they stood by us and we need to stand by them by making sure they have jobs which are well paying and are favourable.” Nominated MCA Emma Wanjiku said many companies do not employ women. “Women are working in construction sites, industries and other male-dominate fields. It is time they also get a stake,” she said. Click here for the latest political news
