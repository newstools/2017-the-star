Mbeere South MP Geoffrey Kingangi yesterday threatened to block construction of a mega solar power producing plant in Embu if residents are not provided with piped water. The Seven Forks Solar Power Plant will be put up by the Kenya Electricity Generating Company in Machanga, Mbeere South constituency. It will be put up on 100 acres. Kingangi said they understand the importance of the project, but constituents have to benefit directly from it. He said the company should provide neighbouring residents with piped water. Kingangi said his lawyers have written to KenGen about it, failing which he will seek legal redress. The plant is expected to produce 45MW of power to be fed to the national grid. Kingangi said the plant will completely block about 50,000 residents from accessing Kamburu Dam and the Tana River, which they rely on for water. Kingangi said in the preliminary environmental and social impact assessment report, the company did not indicate how it will remedy the problem. He accused the company of not involving the community in the plan. “The whole of Mavuria ward and the whole of Kiambere ward will be affected, because that is the only area through which they access water from Kamburu Dam and Tana River,” Kingangi said. “We have said no until they provide an alternative water source.” Speaking to the Star at the Canan Guest House and Hotel, Kingangi said the Seven Forks hydropower dams in his constituency blocked all the traditional watering points, and only Machanga was left. The dams are Masinga, Kindaruma, Kiambere, Gitaru and Kamburu. Kingangi said KenGen could be hiding other impacts from residents. Piped water could be supplied from Masinga Dam, which is in an elevated position, Kingangi said. He said he has tried to talk to the KenGen management, but they did not pay attention.
