Lack of a legal obligation to register marriages in Kenya means there is no safeguard to prevent child marriage, a report by Unicef shows. The agency said lack of a formal record means individuals still get away with marrying children. “Marriage before the age of 18 is a fundamental violation of human rights. In at least 10 sub-Saharan African countries, there is no legal obligation to register a marriage,” Unicef said in its State of the World’s Children 2017 report released yesterday. Although Kenyan law prohibits marriage before 18 years, there is no requirement that unions must be legally registered. The Marriage Act notes chiefs can consider ‘come-we-stay’ affairs that last more than six months as marriages and register them.
