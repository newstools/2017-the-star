A war of words continues, even as staff at Moi University wait for the government to name a new VC. The interviews were carried out last Monday and Prof Isaac Kosgey emerged top. Uasu has rejected the results, saying they demean the university’s status. Supporters of acting VC Laban Ayiro published his qualifications online and so did Kosgey’s. Ayiro tied with Prof Ann Nangulu at second place with 70 marks. Kosgey got 76. Word at the university has it that three interviewers were biased against Ayiro and deliberately gave him “very low marks” to lock him out and pave the way for Kosgey.  The panelists were David Rono, J Koshal, Isabel Kosgei, Vincent Chokaa, Samuel Otieno, Hamisi Dena, Elizabeth Obel and Hilda Muchunku.
