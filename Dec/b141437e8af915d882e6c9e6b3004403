The High court has dismissed an application by two petitioners to file more affidavits challenging the election of Governor Mike Sonko. Justice Msagha Mbogholi noted that the application cannot be granted at this stage, adding that the petitioners failed to lay a basis for it. “The petitioners have cited irregularities in the forms that were used in the elections. However, I find no jurisdiction for granting the prayers, “ Justice Msagha ruled. In the case the two petitioners, Japheth Muroko and Zacchaeus Okoth, wanted the court to allow them file further affidavits saying that IEBC failed to supply them with copies of all the statutory forms. Sonko and IEBC in their defence, said that allowing further admissions of further affidavits would be tantamount to amending the petition.They said no reasonable explanation was given for the failure to file affidavits at the time of filing the petition. IEBC said that KIEMS kits were submitted for reconfiguration for use in the repeat presidential election. Sonko is represented by lawyers Cecil Miller and Harrison Kinyanjui
