Leaders from Garissa county yesterday urged Kenyans to respect the rule of law and co-exist peacefully now that the electioneering period is over. Led by the national chairman of the Livestock Marketing Council, Dubat Amey, they emphasised that no Kenyan is above the law and the interest of the country supersedes that of any individuals, irrespective of their social status. They said the path chosen by NASA in addressing their grievances ‘will surely destroy this country’. “The NASA coalition concerns are genuine, but the manner in which they want them addressed is wrong. Kenyans are losing lives because of a few selfish leaders who have put their interest above that of the common mwananchi,” Amey said. “President Uhuru Kenyatta, being the figure of national unity, should start bringing Kenyans together, irrespective of whether they voted for him or not,” he said. He noted this cannot take place when NASA claims they don’t recognise President Uhuru as the legitimately elected leader. “How do you demand electoral justice when you don’t recognise the government in place? I want to advise Raila Odinga to cool down and recognise President Uhuru if he surely has the interests of the nation at heart,” Amey said. Garissa county Supkem chairman Abdullahi Salat cautioned the youth, especially those who lost in the August 8 polls, against using social media platform to abuse elected leaders. They urged Raila to join President Uhuru in building a cohesive and united country.
