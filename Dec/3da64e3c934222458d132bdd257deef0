NASA leader Raila Odinga has congratulated South Africa's African National Congress Cyril Ramaphosa after being selected to succeed President Jacob Zuma as the party leader. Ramaphosa defeated former cabinet minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, Zuma's ex-wife, after a marathon voting process.  He smiled and hugged other party officials as the results were read out. Zuma sat stone-faced as Ramaphosa's victory was announced. He is in a strong position to become president in 2019 polls.

In a statement on Monday evening, Raila said Ramaphosa’s background will give new energy to Africa’s economic dynamism. "Ramaphosa’s background as democratic liberationist, trade union leader and high-level business executive, and his lifelong Pan Africanism, will also give new energy..and the restored democratic transformations that are indispensable to it," he said.
