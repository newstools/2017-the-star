Starring: Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell, Kathryn Hahn, Cheryl Hines, Christine Baranski, Susan Sarandon Directed by: Scott Moore & Jon Lucas Running time: 104 minutes Premier date: 1st November 2017 Sometimes we just want to watch films that live out our fantasy of being bad. When responsibilities and adulthood has taken its toll, all we ever want to do is let loose and feel young and alive again. That’s the feeling I got watching the original Bad Moms. The sequel A Bad Moms Christmas is basically a holiday themed version of the original. Amy, is now in a relationship with Jessie, plans on spending a nice quiet Christmas with her kids, Jessie and his daughter. Her plans are come to a crashing halt when her overly-critical mother Ruth comes to spend the holidays with her. Meanwhile Amy’s friends Kiki and Carla are also surprised when their own mothers come to visit them for Christmas. Amy, Kiki and Carla feel that being a mom is an extremely stressful job during the holidays and that they do not even get to enjoy Christmas at all! They decide to just have fun this holiday and not stress about having the perfect holiday. But with their own moms in town, the three women soon realise that being bad moms is not what their own mothers have in mind for them. Perhaps adding in the ‘mothers of the moms’ plot was inspired at the beginning but in the end the concept turned into an inter-generational tragedy. Don’t get me wrong, Christine Baranski, Susan Sarandon and Cheryl Hines are legendary actresses whose performance can do no wrong, but the script did not give their performances justice. All in all, the film is not bad per se, it’s just a whirlwind of quirky scenes and unwitty attempt at comedy.
