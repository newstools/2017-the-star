 The implementation of the 2-6-6-3  curriculum is not being rushed and will not cause a fiasco, the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development has said. CEO Julius Jwan said the curriculum is being implemented in phases starting next year and by 2019, pre-primary and lower primary will have been covered.  This is the category of class three and below. It will take seven years to totally roll out the new programme and abolish the 8-4-4 system, Jwan said.  “In 2019, we will roll out standard four and five. In 2020, we shall move to class six. By the time we are finishing the current system, we shall have reached seven years,” he said.  Jwan said the KICD  is using a cascade model to train teachers, who complained they have not built enough capacity and are unprepared.
