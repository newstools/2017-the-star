The Kisii County Government has embarked on a program aimed at producing future athletes. The county’s sports minister Duke Mainga said the program targets primary school pupils. “In the next five years, we want to dominate junior championships. An elaborate program will be rolled out next year,” said Mainga. Mainga spoke when he visited Mogonga mixed secondary school, where 50 athletes are camping for training. He said the county will purchase training kit for selected centres and also sponsor training of coaches. “I’m happy with what I saw at Mogonga. They are doing some good job and should be supported so that they continue producing international athletes,” said Mainga. He congratulated World under-18 silver medalist in 400m Mary Moraa for her feat in July. “We have a lot potential and my main focus is to restore our lost glory,” added the youthful minister. Moraa, a form three student at the institution is among athletes the school has nurtured. Others are US bound David Saruni who captained Team Kenya during the World U-18 and sprinter Elijah Matayo among others.
