 The Kenya National Farmers’ Federation has urged stakeholders at the national and county levels  to support a forestry policy which seeks to regularise commercial farming of trees. The policy is in line with the Kenya Forest Service policy which includes 147 management plans countrywide to help communities living near forests engage in commercial activities and conserve trees. The management plans aim to ensure communities bordering forests benefit through commercial activities including farming, beekeeping, fishing and wood harvesting. Kenaff chief executive officer Daniel Mwenda on Thursday said, “The benefits would be the improvement of their enterprises as trees are good for enhancing soil productivity and improve the environment.” He spoke during a workshop with farmers in Thogoto.
