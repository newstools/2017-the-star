Former Kajiado Senator Peter Mositet on Thursday criticised leaders pushing President Uhuru Kenyatta to appoint their clansmen to government. He said he is particularly irked by a remark attributed to nominated Senator Mary Seneta, who reportedly said the President should reward the Orokiteng’ clan for voting for Jubilee. “She better watch her mouth, because her utterances are aimed at dividing a united Kajiado into clan clusters. She should behave like a mother that she is,” Mositet said. The politician told the legislator not to shame the Kajiado Maa community by dictating who the President should appoint and from what clan.  “This is a shameful approach to issues in the 21st century. Leave the President and his deputy to work and appoint those they deem qualified,” Mositet said. Mositet, who is from Odomong’i clan, said it is wrong to assume only the Orokiteng’ clan voted for Jubilee. “MPs Katoo ole Metito, George Sunkuyia, Janet Teyiaa and Senator Philip Mpaayie come from Odomong’i and they campaigned for Jubilee. I also campaigned for UhuruRuto,” he said.
