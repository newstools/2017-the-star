The High Court yesterday temporarily suspended the Election Amendment Laws 2017 pending the determination of the case challenging their legality. Justice Chacha Mwita issued the orders after hearing both the petitioners and respondent in the case filed by two lobby groups against Attorney General Githu Muigai and the Government Printer. In his short ruling, Mwita said he will deliver the judgment on March 16, but, in the meantime, he was temporarily suspending the laws. “To avoid confusion on the laws which are in force, I exercise my authority and do suspend the election laws pending determination of the case on March 16,” he said. Mwita further granted leave to the respondents in the case to file supplementary submissions on the Supreme Court decision in relation to the amended laws. engineered to regulate event In the case, Katiba Institute, AfriCog, activist Okiya Omtatah and David Ochieng want a determination on whether it was proper for Parliament to pass laws engineered to specifically regulate an event the majority party is unhappy with or opposed to. Through lawyer Waikwa Wanyoike, they argue the amendments significantly confuse the relevant laws on elections, including regulation of some aspects that relate to the ongoing petitions challenging the August 8 polls. They further want the court to determine whether Parliament can pass a law to give effect to the minority opinion of the Supreme Court as a means to circumventing the findings on the majority of the apex court. According to them, it is not proper for Parliament to amend laws to defeat legal actions pending determination before courts or exonerate a person from criminal liability to overthrow tenets of good governance, prudent use of public resources and accountability.
