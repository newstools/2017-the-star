Leaders Kenya Police and Telkom took their 2017 Kenya Hockey Union favourites’ tag to the break after convincing results over the weekend. The league took a break for the Christmas festivities and is expected to resume on January. Police came from a goal down to beat Nairobi Sikh 4-2 to take their points tally to 70 from 25 matches. On other hand, Greensharks leapfrogged former champions Butali Sugar Warrior to second position thanks to a 2-0 win over Kenya College Accountancy University. Sharks have 52 points from 26 matches, while Butali are just a point poor after 21 matches. Telkom were awarded three points after University of Nairobi were a no-show, opting to honour the Kenya University Sports Association (KUSA) games instead. The free three points helped Telkom move to 51 points from 17 matches. Telkom are seeking to defend the title, their 20th, in unbeaten run. They feel the local championship all but over and have already set sights on next year’s Africa Club Championships to be staged in Ghana between January 20 and 28. Coach Jos Openda said their focus is to defend the title they won last year at home. “We are using the league matches as a build-up ahead of the continental championships. Teams in Africa have improved and that’s why we want to be at our best when we head to Ghana for the nine day event,” said Openda, who has been nominated ahead of next years SOYA award ceremony as among the best coach Strathmore University, who played to a 1-1 draw against Sliders are a distant second with 37 points from 17 matches, while Chase Amira complete the top three positions with 34 points from 17 matches.
