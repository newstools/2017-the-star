After a long tussle in court, Ushuru face host Thika United today in the first leg of the promotion/relegation playoff at Thika sub-county Stadium. The playoff received a nod from the Sports Disputes Tribunal (SDT) on Tuesday, dismissing a petition by filled by Thika United to have the two-legged playoff called off. Thika had sought the intervention of the court in challenging the decision by Football Kenya Federation (FKF) after introducing a playoff between the third finisher of the National Super League and the 16th finisher of the SportPesa Premier League. This was contrary to the 2015 Memorandum of Understanding between KPL clubs and FKF which stipulated that only two teams will be relegated and two will earn a promotion. With the long battle in the sports court now solved, the two will meet for the first leg today at Thika before honouring the return leg on Sunday at Narok County Stadium.Thika finished 16th in the Kenyan Premier League whereas Ushuru were third in the National Super League. The winner of the two-legged clash will book a place in the country’s elite football league. Ahead of the clash, Ushuru’s head coach Ken Kenyatta believes it’s time for them to return to the top flight. Kenyatta pointed out fatigue in his squad as the main challenge facing playing unit ahead of the match.  “There is a lot of fatigue in my squad as a result of the long National Super League campaign. We have been holding our training sessions waiting for court’s verdict and I hope the boys will deliver today. I feel it’s the right time to get back to the Kenyan Premier League,” he noted. The two teams were set to honour the playoff on December 6 and 10 but Thika moved to court seeking an injunction to stop the duel. Should they United emerge victorious in the playoff, they will seal their position in the top flight while victory for the tax men will guarantee them a return to the Premier League after spending a year in the second tier.
