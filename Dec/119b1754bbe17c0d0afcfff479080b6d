Fourteen marginalised counties are set to receive more than Sh12 billion Equalization Fund from the Commission on Revenue Allocation in 2018-19. This will help put them at par with other counties. Commissionâ€™s CEO George Ooko yesterday said the CRA is using parameters, such as historical marginalisation and access to basic amenities to consider deserving counties. The counties to benefit are Turkana, Lamu, Mandera, Wajir, Marsabit, Samburu, West Pokot, Tana River, Narok, Kwale, Garissa, Kilifi, Taita Taveta and Isiolo. He spoke to journalists in Narok town. Ooko was accompanied by commissioner Maimuna Mohammed. He said they are going round the 14 counties on a fact-finding mission on the exact areas where the funds will be channelled.
