A 43-year-old man yesterday was charged before a Nakuru court with defiling a 14-year-old boy. Appearing before principal magistrate Joe Omido, Cirus Makenzi was accusedof committing sodomy at Soko Mjinga estate in Nakuru West on December 6. He denied the charges, saying the offence he is being charged with is an allegation from a case already before another court. Makenzi faces similar charges of sodomising five minors and is out on bond. “It’s not true your honor, I was the one who was sodomised and I reported the matter to police but was arrested and charged,” Makenzi told court. According to the prosecution, Makenzi lured the minor into his house and ordered him to commit the act. The boy raised alarm and the neighbors came to his rescue, court papers said. State prosecutor Sandra Kosgey told the court the accused was almost lynched by a mob on the day of arrest. She urged the court not to release him on bond, but remand him until a social inquiry report is availed to the court. “The investigating officer is telling me that the accused person was almost killed by a mob at the scene of the crime. The ground is still hostile and it is not a good idea to release him on bond,” Kosgey said. The accused opposed remand and said he would be safe. Omido ordered the suspect remanded at Nakuru GK Prison until December 27, when a social inquiry report will be availed. “The safety of the accused is paramount to the court, hence, he cannot be released on bond,” Omido said.  Makenzi is also charged with indecently touching the boy.
