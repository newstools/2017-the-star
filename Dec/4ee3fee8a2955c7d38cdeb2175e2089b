Speaking on Tuesday during 54th Jamhuri celebrations at Moi International Centre, Kasarani,Sonko highlighted that with the digitization of revenue streams at City Hall, his administration will next year prioritize infrastructure development and solid waste management. “My desire is to ensure our people enjoy the fruits of independence, as well as devolution by bringing services closer to the people. We have prioritized infrastructure development throughout the 17 subcounties,” Sonko said. Sonko pointed out that there will be a lasting solution to the problem of solid waste which has been a menace within the county.

The city will continue to promote innovation and entrepreneurship, especially for young people.” he added. Sonko highlighted that in the first quarter of 2018, the county will host “The Nairobi we want” convention to review its priority for the next five years. He emphasized the need for Kenyans to embrace the vision of the country’s independence heroes and heroines.
