A last ditch goal line clearance form Joakins Atudo spared Kenya’s Harambee Stars defeat against Libya as the two sides played to a goal less draw in the Cecafa Senior Challenge Cup Group ‘A’ match played in Machakos. Goalkeeper Patrick Matasi, who had been exemplary throughout the match when called into action, dithered on the line, only coming out late before Saed Al Jabal lifted the ball over him, towards an empty net only for Atudo to bail out his Posta Rangers team-mates. Had Libya scored, it would have been great injustice for Stars who had dominated much of the encounter. In fact ten minutes into the game, Masoud Juma forced a save form Ahmed Akazza in the Libya goal. Wyvone Isuza and George Odhiambo were impressive in supporting Masoud up-front but despite their best efforts, their final passes were not good enough to create clear-cut chances for the Sharks’ strikers. Libya were struggling to contain Kenya by fair means and resorted to underhand tactics to keep the home team at bay. Libya’s best effort of the half fell to Khaled Al Maryami, who dragged his shot wide with Matasi beaten. Paul Put replaced Masoud at halftime with Kepha Aswani but chances from open play remained scanty. Atudo forced a save from Ahmed following a set piece just outside the box after Al Jabal had fouled Odhiambo. Miscommunication between Musa Mohammed and Matasi then nearly allowed Khaled to steal in but the Kenyan custodian redeemed himself. Chrispin Oduor, who was the only new face in the starting eleven, was taken off for Ovella Ochieng as Stars searched for winner .The Sharks’ winger first real contribution nearly resulted in a goal as his cross fell to Isuza who rattled the bar from just outside the box. Soon after, Duncan Otieno trademark long range strike just sailed over the bar with Ahmed beaten. Odhiambo, who had come into some rough treatment from the Libyans, was replaced by Vincent Ouma, who barley touched the ball with the few minutes he had on the field.
