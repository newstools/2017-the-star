An Embu magistrate yesterday reprimanded traffic police officers even as he unconditionally released an ambulance driver who had been charged before the court. Erick Ndwiga was arrested and charged in the court following an accident that occurred as he ferried a patient in critical condition to hospital. Ndwiga, an ambulance driver at the Siakago Level Four Hospital was ferrying a patient to the Embu Level Five Hospital for an urgent surgery when the accident occurred on December 11. His ambulance was hit by a pickup truck transporting miraa. Ndwiga asked a motorist to take the patient to the hospital as he waited for police to arrive at the scene. Meanwhile, the miraa vehicle driver harassed him and left the scene. Police blamed Ndwiga for the accident. Embu senior resident magistrate Vincent Nyakundi said police wronged in arresting Ndwiga. “How can he be charged with a traffic offence yet ambulances are exempted from traffic rules? It’s like detaining a police vehicle or a military vehicle. I can’t allow this case to continue. The accused is hereby released unconditionally,” Nyakundi said. He ordered for the immediate release of the ambulance and directed Ndwiga to appear in court on January 3, when his case will be officially terminated.
