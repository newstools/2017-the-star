Job sites remain popular than LinkedIn or social media job advertisements, a recent survey conducted by Trends and Insights for Africa has shown. The findings showed that most job seekers use online platforms, especially online job sites with 60 per cent respondents in the positive, followed by LinkedIn at 23 per cent and social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter at 17 per cent.  “This is a young generation that has access to the internet on a daily basis and even with social media, most of them are looking for jobs on platforms such as brighter Monday while other social media platforms are not so high,” TIFA research chief executive officer Maggie Ireri said. She added that the online job sites appear to be safer and secure for job seekers compared to social media advertisements. Over two thirds of the total sample, (77 per cent), fall between the age of 18 to 34 years with a higher proportion of those aged 18 to 24 years being unemployed.  In addition, the report showed that 89 per cent of the total sample have tertiary education, an indication that the jobs seekers are most likely looking for white collar jobs online.  Other job search platforms used are word of mouth at 14 per cent, traditional job advertising platforms like newspapers used by 12 per cent of the job seekers and recruitment agencies at 9 per cent. The TIFA report showed the three factors unemployed job seekers consider most when job hunting include renumeration and benefits at 62 per cent respondents, career progression at 74 per cent respondent and conducive work environments at 62 per cent respondents. “Most young people are looking for money and career progression to become managing directors in six months and other benefits they can gain from their jobs, other than seeking after the opportunity and experience they will gain," Ireri said.
