Mhasibu Sacco plans to increase its membership from the current 19,000 to 44,000, or 45.7 per cent, by 2020, the management said yesterday. “With many Kenyans being urged to join saccos, we are hopeful that we will achieve our target because, for the last three years, the registration has been shooting up,” the chairman, Andrew Bulemi, said during the inaugural exhibition for the general public in Nairobi. The exhibition will go together with the members’ education and children’s fun day events.  The events aim to bring together the finance and accounting fraternity to explore sustainable trade and entrepreneurship.  The sacco was registered over 30 years ago by the Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Kenya driven by the need to provide a savings and investment platform for members.  Mhasibu, meaning ‘accountant’ in Swahili, has seen exponential growth from a paltry 37 members in 1986, to over 19,000 members and has ambitious plans to grow and provide holistic financial services to its members with the potential member landscape estimated at over 500,000.
