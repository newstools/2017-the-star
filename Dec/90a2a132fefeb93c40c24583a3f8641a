 Two Kitui West MCAs have opposed a proposal for the widow of the former MP Francis Nyenze's widow Edith to succeed her husband. The proposal was floated during Nyenze’s burial at Kyondoni village in Kauwi ward on Tuesday. Kauwi MCA Jane Mutua, while addressing the mourners, said that Edith was fit to inherit her husband’s position as MP. Kitui governor Charity Ngilu and her Mukueni counterpart Kivutha Kibwana backed
the suggestion that the widow should take over.  But Felix Baridi Mbevo of Mutonguni ward and Munyallo Kitheka of Matinyanitwo said locals had not been consulted on how the seat will be filled. They said in a statement that the proposal should be considered null and void adding that it was dictatorial and unconstitutional for leaders to impose an MP on Kitui West constituents.  "The seat should be left for anyone who is interested to contest. As elected leaders, we disassociate ourselves from the public statement." Nyenze died on December 6 from lung complications.
