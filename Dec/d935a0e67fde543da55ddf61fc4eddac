 Samburu Central farmers have been cautioned against selling their maize at low prices. County deputy director for agriculture Stephen Engesa yesterday said the farmers must use the harvest to sustain their families until the next harvest. The farmers received more than 70,000 bags of maize. Engesa said Samburu Central is the only part of the county that had better yields. He spoke to the Star on the phone and urged the county and national governments to help farmers dry and store their maize. Engesa said most farmers sell their maize when it is still green because they have nowhere to store and dry their harvests. “Middlemen take advantage of the situation and buy the maize when it is still on the farms,” he said. Engesa told farmers to wait until mid-January, when maize prices are expected to rise, so they can make profit. He also urged them to use the produce to educate their children. They can take their maize to schools so it is valued and the amount reflected as fee payment, Engesa said. “Some have their children joining form one and colleges. They can talk to the schools and supply maize,” he said.
