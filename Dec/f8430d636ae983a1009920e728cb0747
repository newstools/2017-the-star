World 10,000m bronze medallist Agnes Tirop is keen to upgrade her medal to gold at the Commonwealth Games next year in Gold Coast, Australia. Tirop said she has laid out her training programme with the focus on the Commonwealth Games. Tirop was speaking after winning the Ziwa Farmers 10km race in Eldoret on Saturday, where she beat strong athletes including the world youth 2000m steeplechase silver medallist Sandra Chebet and world steeplechase record holder, Ruth Jebet of Bahrain. She clocked 31:06.2 with Barcelona Marathon champion Valery Ayabei second in 31:07.1. Chebet placed third in 31:18.2 with Stacy Ndiwa (31:27.4) and Jebet (32:01.4) completing the top five places. Tirop intends to use the local and international races as build up for the Club Games in April. “Next season, I will not take part in the cross country because I want to feature in Commonwealth Games. I am happy that I settled for a bronze in London but my next assignment is to upgrade it to gold,” said Tirop, a former world cross country champion. She said she will run a 5km race in Italy later this month before taking part in local races for build up purposes. “I learnt a lot in London worlds this year and I will be working on improvements. I have line up some races for build up,” she added. Two-time Lagos City Marathon winner Abraham Kiptum won the men’s category race in 27:44.0, beating world 10km leader Bernard Kimeli to second in 27:46.0. Josphat Kipchirchir closed the podium in 27:48.0. Kiptum said he is keen to feature in the Africa Cross Country Championships in Algeria. “I am preparing for the cross country season and I hope this time round I will make the cut,” Kiptum, who placed third at this year’s Amsterdam Marathon said.
