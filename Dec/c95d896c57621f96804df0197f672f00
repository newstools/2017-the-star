Primary school heads have opposed the total implementation of 2-6-6-3 curriculum, citing lack of adequate preparation. They said the new curriculum should be implemented in phases to allow learners and teachers to adjust. Teachers said the Ministry of Education cannot successfully implement the syllabus without proper capacity building, infrastructure development and adequate learning materials. Further, the heads called for the hiring of more teachers, saying most schools are too understaffed to execute the requirements of the new curriculum. The headteachers, who are meeting in Mombasa for their annual conference, said the 8-4-4 syllabus was rushed. The government wants to replace the 8-4-4 syllabus with the 2-6-6-3 system of education. The latter will be implemented from January, after a six-month pilot programme.  Kenya Primary School Head Teachers Association chairman Shem Ndolo said rushing the new programme would be a fiasco. "Even the 8-4-4 is not bad. Only that the manner in which it was rushed led to a fiasco," Ndolo said yesterday. He said the government is yet to employ more teachers as promised. He said capacity building for teachers is key to the success of the new curriculum. "You cannot start a programme in school without putting teachers into the picture. Key persons in these reforms are the teachers and students," Ndolo said. He said they will ask Education CS Fred Matiang'i to elaborate on the ministry's preparedness in the programme roll-out. Matiang'i is expected to officially open the conference today. "We want to ask him which classes the ministry wants to start with. We don't want it to fail like the 8-4-4 system," Ndolo said. Ndolo warned against politicisation of education matters. "Politics will make the whole thing collapse. What we want is an explanation on the loopholes we have cited," Ndolo said.
