The High Court in Machakos has dismissed an application by five nominees for executive positions, who were rejected by the county assembly vetting committee. Faith Wathome, Ruth Mutua, Ali Maalim, Naomi Mutie and Kimeu Mbithi had moved to court to seeking orders to prevent Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua and the assembly from filling the positions with new appointees. The nominees argued their fundamental rights would be violated. “Unless interim orders are granted, interested parties will nominate new people to the positions,” the petitioners’ lawyer Wilfred Nyamu told the court. They had urged the court to ensure their rights to hold public office, reasonable and fair administrative action and right to fair trial were not curtailed.    Justice DK Kemei ruled that unless the governor introduces new people or presents the names of petitioners for a second time for vetting, the issue of whether the petitioners’ legitimate expectation or rights violation would not be said to crystallise.  The judge  said from the vetting report of November 8, all the petitioners never made the cut.
