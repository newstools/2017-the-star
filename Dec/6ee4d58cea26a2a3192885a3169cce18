Form One selection begins today for pupils who sat the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education examination.  The government has promised that every student will know by December 12 which school he or she will be joining.  The selection will involve head teachers from public and private primary schools, a milestone in the sector headed by Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i. The selection comes as the government is preparing to roll out the Free Secondary Education programme in January. Radical reforms in the administration of exams — which led to zero cases of cheating and exam cancellation — should ensure selection is transparent and based purely on merit. Cases of influential or rich parents canvassing for their children or relatives should be resisted at all cost. The government is to be commended for its undertaking that all students who attained 400 marks and above will get slots at the national school.  The CS should ensure this is adhered to and all the 9,846 eligible pupils get an equal chance.
