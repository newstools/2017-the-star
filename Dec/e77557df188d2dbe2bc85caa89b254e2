Secretary of UASU at the University Professor Jack Abok said Acting Vice-Chancellor Professor Laban Ayiro is a clear favourite to head the college. Ayiro and Professor Ann Nangulu were tied second with 70 marks. "It's shocking that there are people in the university who can stoop too low in that manner and mess up with such a vital process of a national University," Abok said. Professor Maurice Amutabi got 66 points, Isaac Kibwage got 64 and Joseph Chacha scored 61. The results have been forwarded to Education CS Fred Matiang'i who will appoint one of the top three. He said Matiang'i should go ahead and confirm Ayiro to the position of VC. “His work is open for everyone to see and he has been working very well with the entire university community. His tribe should not be a reason to deny him a chance to serve this country the way he has been doing,” Abok said. Abok said reforms initiated by Professor Ayiro at the university should not be interfered with because the institution was on the path to full recovery.
