The Kitale High Court will on December 22 rule on whether there will be a scrutiny of ballots in the Sirisia parliamentary race. Justice Anthony Murima will also rule on whether the case will be heard in Kitale or transferred to Bungoma. Petitioner Levi Makali had asked the court to transfer the case to Bungoma for residents to attend hearings. Sirisia MP John Waluke, through lawyer Katwa Kigen, opposed the application. Kigen said goons are likely to storm hearings in Bungoma. Makali, who vied for the Sirisia MP seat on the Ford Kenya ticket, lost to Waluke. He petitioned Walukeâ€™s win. Makali told Justice Murima that Waluke was not genuinely elected, alleging there were incidences of bribery, violence and intimidation of voters and IEBC officials during the election. Makali wants the votes recounted, saying there are discrepancies between the results entered on forms 35A and 35B.
