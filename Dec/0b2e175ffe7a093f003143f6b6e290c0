Khwisero All Stars booked a semi final date with Emulunya Chelsea in the fifth edition of the annual Sir Charles Oppong Buchere tournament after eliminating Misango Red Stars 4-2 in the quarterfinals. Khwisero had their noses in front in a well attended match at Emulunya Primary School in Kakamega through their talisman Isaiah Nandwa, who looped the ball over an onrushing keeper. It was a record man of the match performance by Nandwa who was in the best form of his life as he would hit the second, third and fourth goals of the match to become the first player to score four goals in a single match in the history of the tournament. The four goals elevated him to the apex of the scoring charts with six, having netted two in the previous matches. Misango Red Stars managed two consolation goals.  In the other quarterfinal encounter Bafana beat Emuruba 4-3 on post match penalties after a barren draw in regular time.  Bafana now sets a new milestone in the tournament as the first team to have qualified into the semi finals of all the competitions since the tournament was started.  Bafana FC will now meet Olympia in the semi finals.
