AfriCOG can now continue operations after the High Court barred the NGOs Coordination Board from closing it. In a judgment delivered yesterday by Justice George Odunga, the court further ordered the CBK not to freeze AfriCOG’s bank accounts. Odunga also stopped the DPP from instituting any criminal proceedings under the NGOs Act relating to activities and operations of the lobby, or arresting any of its directors. “I have said enough to show that the Notice of Motion dated September 28, 2017 is merited. I, however, agree the Central Bank of Kenya ought not to have been dragged into these proceedings. It is, however, clear that it was the NGO board misplaced letter that provoked that course of events,” he ruled.
