ERNEST CORNEL/ The Mombasa county assembly has approved Governor Hassan Joho’s three executive nominees. They are Devolution’s Seth Odongo, Agriculture’s Hassan Mwamtoa and Trade’s Fawz Ali. The assembly said the three are overqualified after undergoing vetting on Monday. On Friday, the secretary of Committee on Appointments, Rules and Procedures, Salim Juma, said they have communicated to the appointing authority. “It is up to them to set the swearing-in date,” said Juma, who is also the assembly clerk. Joho’s spokesperson Richard Chacha said the three will take the oath of office next week. Six executives have been sworn-in at the Treasury Square. Water’s Fatma Awale missed the November 6 inauguration despite being vetted and approved by the assembly. But Chacha said she was out of the country. “She will take the oath with the three,” he said. Mwamtoa was former Governor candidate Hezron Awiti’s running mate and there was speculation he had spied for Joho. Three weeks before the August ballot, information was leaked that the banker was being considered for a position in Joho’s administration. Joho, who is the ODM deputy party leader, dismissed the claims. He said Mwamtoa is fit for office.
