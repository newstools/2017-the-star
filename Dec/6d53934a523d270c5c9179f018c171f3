 Farmers in the North Rift are using 200kg of fertiliser per acre instead 100 kg per acre. An agriculture expert warns this contributes to high acidity in the soil and low production.  Dr Milton Ayieko, the director of Tegemeo Institute, on Friday said farmers have increasingly been applying a lot of fertiliser to enhance productivity. However, he said too much fertiliser is not good for the soil. He was speaking during the closure of a two-day conference on Transforming Agriculture for Inclusive Growth and Sustainable Livelihoods.  “There is inadequate information on proper agricultural practices. Farmers either use too much or less fertiliser and manure. They hardly do soil tests,” he said. Oyieko said soil testing needs to be done before fertiliser is applied.  Kenya produces at least 40 million bags of maize.  There has been a food crisis this year because of prolonged drought, erratic rainfall and invasion of fall armyworms. This happened late 2016 and early 2017.  Timothy Njagi, a senior research fellow at the institute, said both the national and county governments prefer investing in big projects like irrigation and dams.  Little attention is given to soil testing, data collection and training of extension service providers.
