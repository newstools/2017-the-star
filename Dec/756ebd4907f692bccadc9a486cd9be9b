University managements have been urged to mobilise resources outside the public sector. Anne Nangulu, Kenya’s Commission for University Education deputy secretary for quality audit and standards, yesterday said financing higher education has become a problem. Nangulu briefed the media at Karatina University, Nyeri, on Tuesday during a four-day training workshop for deans and directors of universities on leadership and change. She said universities have been relying on the government for finance, but the sector has really expanded. Nangulu said if the administrators come up with qulity proposals, they may get funding from the European Union, The Dutch and Nuffic. “We are, for instance, doing a mobility scheme in the African continent where we came together at continental level. There are five universities in the project,” she said. “This was a European Union call for mobility scheme, where you can move masters and PhD students, including staff.” Nangulu said the project was written in partnership with the University of Beirut in Germany and they were able to get 1.2 million Euros. She added that the money will make it possible to train masters and PhDs in the five African universities. Nangulu said they are looking towards African Union to sponsor them in sustaining the scheme. “This is what Kenyans have been calling credit transfer. But we want to have quality credit transfers recognised internationally,” she said.
