Police are investigating the brutal murder of a couple by unknown people in Likoni Shell beach area, Mombasa county, on Wednesday. Their three children, aged four, six and nine, were found unhurt. Likoni police boss Benjamin Rotich said the couple was killed on Wednesday night, although their bodies were discovered in their house yesterday. Rotich said the bodies were found in separate rooms after the children alerted neighbours about their missing parents. Rotich said the two were tortured before they were strangled in separate rooms in their home. The attackers did not steal any valuables from the homes. "They only took away their mobile phones. We are yet to establish their motive. But it is clear their intention was to kill the couple," Rotich said. The husband, 47, and his wife, 27, had their hands and legs tied before they were killed. Police said they were also blindfolded. The rooms were locked from outside by the attackers. Police said they gained access to the home without breaking in. A team of homicide detectives have lined up several people for interrogation, police said. "They died a painful death after being tortured," an officer who visited the scene told the Star. The rooms have been sealed off. Neighbours said the man was an engineer, working with a government parastatal. Their bodies were taken to the Coast General Hospital, awaiting autopsy. The killing comes on the backdrop of runway crime in Likoni by knife wielding youth. Rotich said it was too early to link the couple's murder with local criminal gangs. At least four gangs, with more than 200 juvenile members, terrorise residents. They have raided many homes and business despite police warnings. The National Intelligence Service had warned that the knife-wielding gangs could degenerate into more dangerous groups.
