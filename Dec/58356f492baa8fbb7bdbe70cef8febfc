Deputy President William Ruto yesterday urged leaders from the pastoral communities to work together to fix problems undermining their development. He said problems such as insecurity, FGM, school dropouts and early marriages can only be resolved if leaders worked together, irrespective of their political affiliations. “People are viewing pastoralists as people who have denied their children the opportunity to go to school, people who are riddled with poverty or conflicts. We need to change this perception,”  Ruto said, during the closure of a two-day Pastoralists Parliamentary Group meeting at Nyali Sun Africa Beach Hotel, Mombasa.

Ruto (pictured) told the regions’ MPs, MCAs and opinion leaders to dedicate their time to tackling such issues with a view to catching up with the rest of Kenyans. “What is clear is that all those children who are not in school are those from the pastoral areas. We must not deny our children the chance to go to school. We must be forthright about such issues,” he said.  The government and the World Bank have set aside Sh8.5 billion to assist the pastoralist communities, the DP said. He said the money will be used to build water pans, sink boreholes, construct markets, buy hay, establish slaughterhouses, insure livestock and improve animal health.
