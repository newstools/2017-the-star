New HIV infections among children have decreased dramatically from a high of 16,000 in 2009 to about 6,000 in 2016 — a 63 per cent reduction. “Kenya is indeed on track to eliminating new infections among children by 2021,” National AIDS and STIs Control Programme head Dr Bartilol Kigen said on Friday. This is due to a recently launched framework for elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV and syphilis, he said. “Cuba was the first country globally to be validated for elimination of mother-to-child transmission and Kenya can now dare to dream of the same by 2021,” Kigen said. He also said at least 75 per cent of condoms are being used by commercial sex workers and gays as part of a HIV-Aids control measure. It is a combined figure. Condom use remains the number one protection tool.  It protects not only against HIV-Aids, but also against other sexually transmitted infections and unintended pregnancies. NASCOP recently rolled out nation-wide HIV control measures for key populations, such as sex workers, men who have sex with men, intravenous drug users, fisherfolk and long-distance truck drivers.  The measures include condom promotion, STI screening and treatment, and HIV testing and treatment.  This is expected to reach more than 135,000 female sex workers, 24,000 male sex workers and 13,000 intravenous drug users. More than 150 million condoms are distributed annually to the public. In a statement, Kigen said there is more than 75 per cent condom use and more than 90 per cent HIV testing rates among the key populations. The IDU programme also led to the commencement of Opioid Substitution Therapy in 2015, through the Methadone Assisted Therapy in seven specialised clinics in major towns. Kenya has more than methdone users in rehabilitation therapy.
