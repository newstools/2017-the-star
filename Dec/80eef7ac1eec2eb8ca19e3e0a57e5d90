Police on Friday
arrested two women for possessing and circulating fake money in
Marakwet West.
 The two, aged 20 and 22, were arrested at Cheptongei trading centre after using the
fake Kenyan currency to buy goods at a retail shop. Area police boss Apollo Onyonyi said the women had the fake notes in Sh1,000 and Sh500 denominations. He said
the two suspects had purchased various commodities using the fake notes as they
kept the genuine change from unsuspecting traders in the area. "Members of the public alerted the police after a trader detected the
fake currencies. We recovered for Sh1000 fake notes and two of Sh500." The
suspects, who are detained at Kapsowar police station, said they got the fake monies in Nairobi. "We highly suspect
that this is a racket spearheaded by fraudsters in Eldoret," the police boss told journalists. He urged
traders to be cautious and scrutinise notes. Click here for the latest political news Â
