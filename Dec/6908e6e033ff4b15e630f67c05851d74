NSSF on Friday evicted Nakumatt from its premises at Hazina Trade Centre over rent arrears accumulated for the past four months. The pensions body shut Nakumatt Lifestyle and clamped the retailer's vehicles after obtaining a court order.  "These premises have been closed. All enquiries to be directed to the landlords' managing agents," NSSF said in a notice on Friday. The agents are Tysons Limited whose offices are located at the  first floor of the Jubilee Insurance house. Wycliff Ongwae, an agent, told the Star that they cannot disclose the exact amount of money the retail chain owes NSSF. "The shop has been closed over substantial amounts that I cannot disclose," he said. Nakumatt Holdings reached an agreement with Tuskys to take over its management in a deal expected to see the troubled retailer remain afloat. The agreement will see Nakumatt access stock from suppliers using the Tuskys supermarket goodwill and value chain. This will go a long way in helping the chain restock as suppliers had shied away from supplying them due to mounting debts.
