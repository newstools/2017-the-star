Wajir Governor Mohamed Abdi has urged local leaders to stop politicking at the expense of development. Speaking during 53th Jamhuri Day celebrations held at Wajir Stadium, Abdi challenged residents to actively participate in county projects and programmes. . Abdi said his administration is engaging the national government and donors to support major infrastructure and water projects. He said his key objectives include supply of water for people and livestock and increasing the acreage of land under irrigation agriculture. Abdi said the national government in partnership with donors will soon begin construction of four dams in Bute, Wajir North, Eldas, Tarbaj and Diif in Wajir South. The governor said his administration will ensure ward-based development projects have enough resources for them to be implemented swiftly. He said residents will be involved in monitoring the projects. Abdi said Sh750 million has been allocated to the 30 wards - each will receive Sh25 million. He urged communities to identify projects that need to be prioritised. Abdi said his administration has began preparation for the second Generation County Integrated Development Plan 2018-2022 in line with the Constitution and County Government Act 2012. The county has planned public participation forums from December 13 -17 to collect views. Abdi urged MPs and MCAs to use their time during recess to mobilise communities to participation in large numbers. He directed the department of finance and economic planning to ensure the county’s 15-point Plan Transformational Manifesto is mainstreamed into the CIDP. “Once finalised and implemented, we envisage Wajir will return to its lost glory. It will be food secure, peaceful and progressive. We want to create a secure and competitive county,” Abdi said.
