The use of drugs in schools and colleges has reached “explosive levels”, the National Authority for the Campaign Against Alcohol and Drug Abuse has said. Acting Nacada CEO Victor Okioma on Thursday said Kenyans are sitting on a “time bomb”, considering the rate at which young girls and boys were engaging in drug abuse. “We did a research recently on the use of drugs in high schools and colleges of all levels and found that the use of drugs by our children is real,” he said. Okioma urged Kenyans to assist Nacada in the campaign against drug abuse. The agency will sponsor another survey in January to assess the impact of drugs in private and public primary schools. Okioma was speaking in the Kajiado KCB grounds during the unveiling of early childhood development education teachers by Governor Joseph Lenku. Some 593 teachers, who were on contract terms were formally employed. Lenku said teachers should be appreciated because of their noble calling. “These young children are looking up to you for their future,” he told the teachers.  “Consult with us. We are always ready to help. As you report to your respective stations in January, I wish you the best of luck.” The county enrolled 6,196 pupils in standard one in 2017 and the number will increase in 2018. “I am aware that this enrolment should go hand-in-hand with infrastructure,” Lenku said.  He said the county has built 396 classrooms. “We now have 1,119 ECDE centres up from 707 in 2016.”
