"Don't kill us," victims of the Baringo AP lorry accident pleaded with rescuers, mistaking them for bandits. The lorry overturned on Saturday as the driver attempted to avoid hitting some goats crossing the road at Sibilo Lions, about two kilomtres from Loruk centre. Six people have been shot dead at Kapedo and Nadome, on the border of Baringo and Turkana counties, since last Monday. “When we approached the victims, some were unconscious while some pleaded with us not to kill them and demanded to know who we were and where they were,” a rescuer told the Star yesterday. "They thought the accident happened as a result of attack by armed Pokot bandits." The rescuers reassured them and the victims relaxed enough to allow the team to get them out of the wreckage. “We also assured them the place was Loruk, Tugen land, but not Tiaty,” the source said. Most of the victims were Turkana residents heading to Kapedo from Marigat town. Some 23 were killed and 15 injured. Most of the AP officers in the lorry escaped unhurt and helped to rescue the injured. The victims boarded the officers’ vehicle for safety, following attacks between the Pokot and Turkana at Kapedo and Lomelo, on the border of Baringo and Turkana counties.  “Following attacks in Kapedo and Nadome last week in which six people were killed, Pokots decided to block the road connecting Lomelo and Kapedo, leaving Turkanas no option but to travel in police officers vehicles,” the source said.  Ameyan market in Tiaty subcounty has been closed, while Pokots are not allowing Turkanas from Kapedo to cross their borders to Marigat in Baringo South. On Sunday, Turkana Governor Josphat Nanok and his Baringo counterpart Stanley Kiptis visited Kabarnet Hospital to comfort the victims.  Fourteen died at the scene of the accident while nine succumbed at Baringo County Referral Hospital, Kabarnet OCPD Eliud Njeru said.
