The DPP has rejected a plea bargaining request by Dr David Muchiri accused of killing a Kenya Revenue Authority lawyer. When the case came up for mention yesterday before High Court judge Jessie Lessit, the DPP, through senior state counsel Alloys Kemo, said the case should proceed to full hearing. Muchiri, through his lawyer Vincent Nyangayo, said the defence has written to the DPP to consider plea bargaining. He is detained at the Industrial Area remand prison (pictured). Muchiri denied killing lawyer Jared Ratemo on July 11 at Fig Tree Medical Centre, Ngara, in Nairobi. He is also on trial alongside former Imenti Central MP Gideon Mwiti in another case, where they are accused of sexual violence. The case is pending before the Milimani chief magistrate’s court. A postmortem on Ratemo’s body revealed he had been tortured, injected with an unknown substance and strangled. The 46-year-old doctor is accused of killing Ratemo at his clinic, where he was undergoing treatment. His body was found dumped near JKIA on Mombasa Road. The lawyer’s death is allegedly linked to an investigation he was carrying out. Mokua, 35, and a father of three, was a supervisor at the Kenya Revenue Authority’s Customs and Border Control Department, Consolbase Container Freight Services, Mombasa. He travelled to Nairobi to solve a tax matter when he met his death.
