Kisii county commissioner Godfrey Kigochi has raised concerns over whether the large number of foreigners in the town are in the country legally. He said, “There must be a reason why they are coming here. There is an urgent need to establish the reason.” Kigochi spoke at the Gusii Stadium on Tuesday during Jamhuri Day celebrations. Present were Governor James Ongwae (pictured) and Deputy Governor Joash Maangi. Kigochi said he will work closely with Ongwae to ensure the issue of foreigners is addressed, adding some might have ill motives.  He assured residents of their security during the festive season. “Patrols have been beefed up in all corners of the county,” Kigochi said. He said his office will convene a meeting with Ongwae to discuss ways to ensure boda boda operators obey the law. There has been a rise in accidents involving boda bodas.
