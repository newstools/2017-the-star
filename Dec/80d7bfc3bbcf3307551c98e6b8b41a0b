Residents of Kibagare village in Lari constituency are worried they might not enjoy Christmas due to lack of water. Residents from the less than 2,000 homesteads said they get water from a borehole located at Kibagare primary school and, which is managed by the Limuru Water and Sewarge Company. Led by Peter Ng'ang'a, they said the problems started in early November, when a fuse at a local Kenya Power transformer blew up. They say the water pump was affected and they do not get enough water. “We do not know what to do. When we go to the Limuru Water company, they refer us to the Kenya Power,” he said yesterday. “We pay for the water every month.” Residents appealed to President Uhuru Kenyatta, Water CS Eugene Wamalwa, Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu and area MCA Joseph Karichu to intervene. The MCA confirmed receiving complaints, saying they have organised a meeting with residents on Wednesday to discuss the issue and get a way forward. “We need to know what is happening,” Karichu said.
