A seven-year-old boy was killed by a snakebite in Baringo North subcounty on Saturday. Sammy Kipsang said his firstborn son Nicolas Kipruto died at Kabartonjo Subcounty Hospital. The standard two pupil at Borsiso Primary School was herding cattle on a farm in Kapkoiwo village, when he was bitten at 10am. “I was doing chores when I heard someone scream. I rushed down to the farm and found my son crying for help,” Kipsang said. The nearby Poi Dispensary had no antivenom. Kipsang trekked 15km to Kipsaraman Dispensary, where he was referred to Kabartonjo. “Some minutes after noon, he just jumped over my chest, got hold of my neck, vomited and died,” a sobbing Kipsang said. Saimo-Kipsaraman MCA John Aengwo criticised the county government for not equipping health facilities, lack of ambulances and poor roads. He said the only available ambulance at Kabartonjo was being serviced. Aengwo said KWS took too long to visit the scene
