The High Court has directed the Office of the Attorney General to constitute an agreement into settlement of payment by the permanent Secretary, Office of the President as compensation to a man who was hit by a government motor vehicle. Judge George Odunga gave the directions following a consent where the Interior PS Karanja Kibicho was wanted in court for contempt following an order directing the PS to compensate Patrck Mutua a sum of Sh223,625 for injuries caused. “The AG’s office will constitute an agreement to settle Mutua’s pay since the first judgement was delivered in 2008 to have him compensated for injuries and all costs he incurred during the accident and the ministry has taken so long “, Odunga said. Odunga had previously issued a warrant of arrest in May when Kibicho failed to honour court orders in compensating Mutua, who was knocked down by an employee of the Office of the President while driving on Mbagathi road in 2007. Mutua said he was driving his motorcycle doing his business when the vehicle veered towards him and he sustained injuries and went to the hospital.  He wrote to the ministry and the Attorney General asking for compensation but he was ignored.
