Mwingi Central MP Gideon Mulyungi has said Wiper will support its leader Kalonzo Musyoka as its presidential candidate in 2022, with or without NASA.  He said the party does not care whether Kalonzo will have the blessing and support of ODM leader Raila Odinga.  Mulyungi told ODM to stop dictating what happens in NASA if it does not want Wiper to leave the alliance.  He said ODM has taken up all top leadership seats in House committees and this has angered its affiliates.  “Kalonzo has asked for this seat for a long time. We’ll support him to be the flagbearer in a coalition that will be formed. If there will be no coalition, Kalonzo is man enough to run alone. He will win. All Kambas will definitely support him — even those who defected — as there will be no option,” he said.  Mulyungi said he has a premonition that NASA is headed for a major split if swift action is not taken to end internal grumblings.
