One person has been shot dead and another is nursing gunshot wounds after suspected remnants of the Sabaot Land Defence Force terrorised a village in Kopsiro, Mt Elgon. The attack took place on Friday midnight. This is barely two weeks after eight people were killed by suspected SLDF militants. But Mt Elgon MP Fred Kapondi has denied claims the perpetrators are SLDF remnants, saying those involved are “just a few criminals on a revenge mission”. Confirming the killing, Cheptais deputy county commissioner Stephen Momanyi said the midnight attacks seem to be targetting certain people. “We have many guns in the wrong hands. These people are not willing to hand them over to the security agencies. They buy them from a neighbouring country,” he said.
