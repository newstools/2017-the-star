Lawyer Nelson Havi wants the court to stop elections at the Law Society of Kenya slated for February 12. Havi was disqualified from contesting for the president's seat in the society on December 13. LSK chief executive officer Mercy Wambua said Havi is ineligible as he has not been a member of the LSK council as required in
its statute. She said Havi will not have attained 15 years of
service as a legal practitioner by the
time LSK is holding elections. "You shall have attained at least 15 years' experience as a legal practitioner ... on June 12, 2018, which is over three months after the election date," Wambua said in a letter. More on this: Nelson Havi barred from contesting LSK presidency But Havi has disputed the decision and termed it unlawful. The lawyer wants the court to declare Section18 (1) and Section 2 (a) and (b) of the LSK Act, 2014
unconstitutional as it discriminates on the basis of age and status for
the election of president, vice president and council member. He argues that he is qualified to vie for the seat since he has 15 years' experience as a practicing lawyer. Havi says he was admitted to the bar in June 2003 but has had "an illustrious career with tremendous service to the public". He says he is also pursuing a Masters degree at the University of Nairobi. The lawyer wants the election halted until the case is heard and determined. Click here for the latest political news Â
