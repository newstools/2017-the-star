 Second-half substitute Olivier Giroud rescued Arsenal with a late equaliser in a 1-1 draw at St Mary’s yesterday after Southampton had looked like holding on for all three points. The France international, who replaced compatriot Alexandre Lacazette in the 72nd minute of a lively game, scored two minutes from fulltime with a glancing header off an Alexis Sanchez cross.  Southampton had made Arsenal sweat until then with Charlie Austin grabbing a fourth goal from his last three league starts with a third-minute shot past Petr Cech after being fed through by Dusan Tadic.  It was the 17th time Giroud has scored as a substitute for Arsenal, equalling Norwegian Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s record with Manchester United for most goals scored off the bench for a single club. If the draw remained a lost opportunity for the Gunners, the goal at least staved off a second successive league defeat after a stinging 3-1 loss to Manchester United at the Emirates last weekend.  “Last week had an influence on today’s game,” Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose side played in the Europa League on Thursday, said “They wanted to start strong but it took us time to get into the game again,” added the manager, who criticised the amount of time-wasting in the match. “I think he (Giroud) has come back into a very good shape, he’s shown that today again. He’s mentally extremely strong as well.,” he said.
