The Kiambu government has announced plans to repossess grabbed road reserves. Roads executive John Mugwe yesterday said traders have built kiosks along the road reserves, making it difficult for vehicles and pedestrians to use them. He also said many residents have neglected their live fences, allowing them to overgrow and in the end squeezing the roads. Mugwe said whenever an emergency arises, ambulances and firefighters find it hard to access some areas. “The roads are too squeezed and yet they are supposed to be wide enough,” he said. Mugwe spoke in Limuru town. He said there are roads which are six meters wide and nine meters wide, but they have been squeezed too much, leaving them without a drainage channel. Mugwe warned traders who have built kiosks on road reserves to move, before the government evicts them. “We want to achieve good roads that are wide enough, with drainage so that we can construct culverts. If they were six meters or nine meters wide, they will remain like that, then we improve them so that we can improve mobility,” he said. Click here for the latest political news
