Young people aged 15-24 are leading in HIV infections in Kiambu county. Health executive Joseph Murega on Friday said the age group is the worst-hit because young people explore the changes that occur in their bodies during their teenage years. He said some seek love and a sense of belonging and they end up falling into traps. “Young people of between the ages of between 15 and 24 are getting infected too much. Their number is still rising, while that of the middle-aged people is stagnant — meaning they have controlled the spread,” Murega said in Limuru during a World Aids Day event. He said many people don’t go for tests. They visit hospitals when they have been infected with opportunistic diseases, only to be found they are suffering from Aids, he said.
