President Uhuru Kenyatta has promised to work with Parliament to ensure more funds are allocated to the Judiciary. Speaking on Friday at the Supreme Court in Nairobi, Uhuru said the funds will be used to relocate the Court of Appeal (pictured) to create a conducive environment for effectiveness of judicial officers. He spoke during the official release of the report on the state of the Judiciary and administration of justice by Chief Justice David Maraga. Uhuru was the chief guest. He urged judges to be mindful of the effects of their decisions on ordinary citizens. “Any decision that negatively affects the desire of a better and prosperous life for the average Kenyans or their safety and well-being should be carefully interrogated before being undertaken,” Uhuru said.

Uhuru also asked judicial officers, including Maraga, to grow thick skins and be open to criticism of all nature. “I speak from my experience as a politician. You ought to accept that criticism comes with the office. Whether in media, in the journals or on social media. Kenyans will have their say, and little enough of it will be flattering, or even sensible,” Uhuru said. Maraga emphasised the independence of the Judiciary but also underscored its interdependence with other arms of government. “It is my belief that if the heads of the three arms of government resolve to fight corruption with unfaltering zeal, we will significantly reduce it, if not eliminate it altogether,”  Click here for latest political news
