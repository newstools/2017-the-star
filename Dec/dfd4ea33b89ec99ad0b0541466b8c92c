 An Embu man who last year separated from his wife of 20 years yesterday declared publicly that he is seeking another wife to “take care of me and my daughter”. Bedan Njiru, 46, from Kivwe Village, Embu West subcounty, yesterday said  he does not want to engage in extramarital affairs. An interested woman must be serious to enter into marriage — jokers are not invited, he told the Star in Embu town. She has to be a devoted Christian aged at least 35 years. The labourer said he is a committed Christian and abhors “wayward relationships”.  Njiru (pictured) can be reached through his mobile phone number — 0790523026. He expects many calls, but says he will have the final decision. Those who contact him will have to be vetted to determine if they have “the best qualities” that befit a staunch Christian, Njiru said.         He has an eight-year-old daughter with special needs. He finds it difficult to take care of her because he has to work to feed her and provide other needs. He took custody of the child when they separated. Njiru said he loves her so much and wants somebody who will be committed to “living with us permanently” and sharing in his aspirations. He said after separating from his wife for reasons he did not want to disclose, he has no hope of reuniting with her. “I’m looking for a housewife who will be ready to commit her life to me so we can live together as husband and wife. I have marital needs and the daughter needs a lot of care,” Njiru said. Villagers said his decision to go public, “instead of looking for one quietly”, surprised them. They said people should not make public their marriage decisions. Some said this was “weird”. But Njiru defended his approach. He hopes to succeed.
