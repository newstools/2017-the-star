A storm is brewing in Jubilee after a section of Rift Valley MPs yesterday came to the defense of four other JP lawmakers who were dewhipped from House committees. The meeting at Parliament Buildings was convened by Cherangany MP Joshua Kutuny. It was attended by Senate Majority leader Kipchumba Murkomen, Silas Tiren (Moiben), Alfred Keter (Nandi Hills), Kangogo Bowen of Marakwet West, among others. They resolved that should Jubilee Party effect the dewhipping, they will sponsor a motion to impeach National Assembly leader Aden Duale. “Rift Valley members are concerned because of the misunderstanding arising following election of committee chairpersons and their vice chairpersons,” Kutuny said after the meeting yesterday. “It was important for the MPs to meet and seek a consensus on how the matters should be resolved.” Tiren, Keter, Kangogo and Alex Kosgey of Emgwen were on Wednesday recalled from committees. This came after they defied President Uhuru Kenyatta’s directive on his preferred lineup. The so-called rebels are said to have colluded with NASA lawmakers to contest committee leadership. In surprise victories, Keter and Tiren were elected chairpersons of the Labour and Social Welfare and Agriculture committees, respectively. Keter defeated Ali Wario of Bura, who had been preferred by Uhuru. Kangogo was also elected, against Uhuru’s wishes. He defeated Sophia Abdi of Ijara to become chairman of the Environment committee. Uhuru had endorsed Abdi. Kosgey unsuccessfully challenged Kieni MP Kanini Kega, elected chairman of the Committee on Trade. The more than 10 Jubilee MPs also complained no member from the Rift Valley was placed in the committees on Administration and National Security and on Public Investment. They said membership of the committees was “skewed”. Murkomen is said to have assured the MPs he would organise a meeting with DP William Ruto to sort out their concerns.
