Men siring children out of wedlock will have to cater for 50 per cent of the children’s needs if a bill set to be tabled in Parliament becomes law. The Child Support Bill sponsored by Thika Town MP Patrick Wainaina seeks to ensure all children are raised and their needs catered for by both parents. Once the bill becomes law, parents, whether wedded or not, will contribute 50 per cent each for their child’s upkeep. “This bill is not meant for men only. It’s for child support and targets both parents. Whoever lives with the kid gets paid by the other parent,” Wainaina said on Saturday at Madaraka market.  “The 50 per cent is for the needs of a child. Each parent contributes 50 per cent until the child is employed or hits 21 — whichever comes first.” The bill also tasks the state to fund DNA testing for parents seeking to prove paternity or maternity. Wainaina (pictured) said the bill will protect against abandonment and neglect. He urged parents to be responsible.
