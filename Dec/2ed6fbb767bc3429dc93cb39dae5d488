 Two ANC MPs from Kakamega county have said the party is being sidelined by ODM in NASA. Lugari’s Ayub Savula and Matungu’s Justus Murunga yesterday said ANC is being treated as a lesser partner yet party leader Musalia Mudavadi founded NASA. Savula said the coalition had sidelined ANC’s representation in the Parliamentary Service Commission. He protested last week against the exclusion of the party from representation in the National Assembly leadership. While ANC demanded it be given the deputy Minority leader position in the National Assembly, NASA CEO Norman Magaya presented names that exclude ANC members. The list presented had Suba East MP John Mbadi (ODM) as Minority leader, deputised by Robert Mbui of Wiper. Suna East MP Junet Mohammed (ODM) was named Minority whip with Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa (Ford Kenya) as his deputy. Murunga said ODM was engaged in the shenanigans that led to the breaking of the original Ford party ahead of the 1992 first multi-party elections. He said the ANC helped the opposition present a formidable force against Jubilee at the August 8 polls.
