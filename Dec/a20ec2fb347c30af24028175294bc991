The other six were admitted to the hospital with injuries. The interns were going to Gatundu from Juja when the accident happened. Gatundu Level 4 Hospital Medical Superintendent Anne Wairagu said those admitted were in stable condition and were under observation. Speaking on Friday during a memorial service for the three Wairagu said the CT facility at the hospital has also not been operational due to lack of a power stabilizer. She lamented the loss of the young medics which she described as not only a loss to their families but the country and the medical profession at large. Thika Medical superintendent Dr Patrick Nyaga said though medics are used to death on almost a daily basis, it becomes traumatic experiencing the death of their colleagues.
