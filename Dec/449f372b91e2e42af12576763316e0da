The gospel music industry in Kenya has had some of the most controversial moments in the past few years, from Bahati marrying an older woman to Willy Paul's lavish tendencies.  Society expects artistes, especially those peddling the good word, to be authentic. After all as 'wahenga' say 'Wasanii ni kioo cha jamii'. On the hypocrisy in the industry - artistes pretending to spread the word of God when they are only in it for business - Pascal Tokodi had something interesting to say.  "I don't mind if they sing about love...or if they sing about God. As long as you're sending a positive message out there, I am happy about that."  On the state of the Kenyan music industry, he urged his fellow artistes to support each other instead of racing for success while beefing.  "I am not here to compete though. You know, when people say, 'co-ompetition'? We are helping each other but we are growing at the same time. We need to have a sound. Like when you hear Bongo, you know it's from Tanzania. Same for Kwaito, it takes you to South Africa."  Pascal is currently topping charts with his single Songa.
