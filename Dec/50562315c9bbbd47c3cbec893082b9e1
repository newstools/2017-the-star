West Pokot leaders and elders yesterday held traditional prayers to bless county projects and welcome the New Year. The elders slaughtered two bulls, then held prayers before roasting the meat and feating. The occasion, which was conducted under a tree beside the River Saum, was also to “bless” the national government for setting up dykes along the river in 2012. The river used to burst its banks during downpours, disrupting transport between Kapenguria and Kacheliba constituencies. Those present included Governor John Lonyangapuo, Senator Samuel Poghisio and MCAs.  Lonyangapuo said the dykes were constructed in 2012 after the river flooded and disconnected the two regions. “We could not have celebrated immediately the dykes were set up because we never knew the outcome. For over five years, we have not experienced floods. That’s why we have decided to hold special prayers,” he said. Resident Rose Abulot said, “We used to migrate every year due to floods, but we have never migrated since the dykes were built. Many patients died and pregnant mothers suffered as they could not reach hospitals during rainy seasons,” she said. Lonyangapuo said the prayers will enable the county to experience “good things such as rains, good health and peace. The prayers are held annually before Christmas to ask God to bless our land and the prayers are not meant to curse anybody.” He urged the youth not to incite each other. Elders who led the prayers were picked from the county’s clans. Residents informed them of the blessings they wanted from God so that they are considered during the occasion. Poghisio said women are not allowed to feast on the meat. He said they decided to slaughter two bulls because they expected many guests, “as the ceremony brings together residents of two constituencies”. The legislator urged residents to plant trees along the river to help control soil erosion.
