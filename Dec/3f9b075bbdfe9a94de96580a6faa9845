Thika Town MP Patrick Wainaina has objected to the construction of a section of the Thika Bypass from the Del Monte shop off the Nyeri-Nairobi Highway to the River Chania. The section is part of the 25km bypasses project funded by the state through the Kenya Urban Roads Authority in Thika and has been included in the first phase of the project. The government has set aside Sh1.5 billion for the project. Wainaina said the section of the road is in Murang’a county, yet the money was allocated for roads in Thika Town constituency. Speaking during a stakeholders’ meeting called by Kura officials on the Kamenu Estate, Wainaina said he will meet Murang’a Governor Mwangi wa Iria and agree on how the stretch will be constructed. “The money was meant to serve Thika Town constituency not Murang’a county. I’ll seek audience with Governor Iria and see if he can construct the stretch to Chania River and then we take up the construction from the bridge on our side to BAT-Kiganjo-Athena-Witeithie and connect it to the superhighway,” Wainaina said. He said the cash meant for the stretch can be diverted to other routes within the constituency. Wainaina said he is not against the tarmacking of the road in Murang’a county. He said what he is against is the use of funds meant for Thika Town constituency in another region. Kura’s chief sociologist Josiah Mwangi said he will deliver Wainaina’s sentiments to his seniors for consideration.  Wainaina said Thika Town is steadily regaining its status as an industrial hub.
