Nairobi MCAs boycotted a plenary session on Tuesday to protest a requirement that they provide security for loans.  They said they have been asked to surrender logbooks or title deeds for them to secure mortgage and car loans. They converged outside the chamber and pledged not to attend sessions if their grievances are not addressed.  They said most of them are first- time MCAs and do not have logbooks or title deeds for collateral. “Most of us here are poor. We have never owned a car or land.  And now someone tells us to provide logbooks, where will we get them?” Karura MCA Joseph Wambugu, said.  He said their payrolls can act as collateral. MCAs are entitled to Sh3 million for a mortgage and a Sh2 million car loan.  But Majority leader Abdi Guyo and Minority chief whip Peter Imwatok said loans and mortgage regulations approved by the assembly requires that the members should provide security for their loans.
