An AP officer yesterday appeared in a Nanyuki court. Michael Chege is accused of shooting dead his 27-year-old uncle Peter Njoroge. No formal charges were preferred against the 32-year-old since police applied for more time for further investigations. The suspect could be charged with murder. Investigating officer Joseph Indeke told chief magistrate Lucy Mutai the AP officer, based in Taita Taveta, is the prime suspect in the Saturday night shooting. Njoroge died in hospital. Indeke said the AP officer was visiting home for a family gathering in Kariguini village, Laikipia Central, when the two started fighting. Chege was armed with his official firearm since earlier in the day he had driven his boss to Nairobi for official duty. Â
