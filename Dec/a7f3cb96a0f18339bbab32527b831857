Divers and experts whose equipment was used in the recovery effort in the Lake Nakuru chopper crash are crying foul.  They are accusing the county government of failing to help them ferry back the equipment.  Lake Naivasha Boat Owners Association chairman David Kilo said they have been forced to make their own plans to transport their boats back to Naivasha.

They have made several requests for help to county officials, but they have not received any response.  A senior county officer, who declined to be named, admitted that there was confusion over the issue of funding due to the many parties involved. “During the recovery operation we had Sonko Rescue Team, the navy, the Naivasha team and even locals. It was a challenge to deal with all these groups,” said the officer. The helicopter crashed into the lake a few minutes after take-off from Jarika Hotel on October 21 with five people on board.
