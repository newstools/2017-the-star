The ODM is treating other NASA affiliate parties as junior partners, two MPs from the Abagusii community have said. Richard Onyonka (Kitutu Chache South) and Ben Momanyi (Borabu) said Wiper, Ford Kenya and ANC were both shortchanged by ODM in the sharing of Parliamentary leadership positions. “We shall reconsider our position in NASA if ODM continues to mistreat us. We are equal partners in the coalition and we should be treated as such," Onyonka said. He said NASA had been fighting for fairness and equity in the distribution of national resources and should practice the same within its ranks. Onyonka was eyeing the chairmanship of the committee on Implementation. He was up against ODM’s Simba Arati. Onyonka said he was unhappy with Arati's bid because the seat was preserved for Ford Kenya. He criticised both Jubilee and NASA for giving the Abagusii community a raw deal in House leadership positions and the East African Legislative Assembly election. “Jubilee shortchanged Charles Nyachae in the EALA elections. As a community, we are not happy with the way we are being treated," Onyonka said. He said it was the first time in 15 years that the community was left out of the regional assembly. "It is time Abagusii leaders thought of having their own party,” Onyonka said. Momanyi criticised ODM for taking all NASA's three slots in the Parliamentary Service Commission."What ODM is doing is wrong and unacceptable. It ought to have taken two slots because of its numeric strength and leave the other for Wipe," Momanyi said.
