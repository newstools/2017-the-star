City Hall has explained 27 ‘questionable’ banks accounts it operates in various commercial banks. A report tabled in the county assembly chamber last Thursday revealed City Hall runs 31 banks accounts — four at the Central Bank and 27 at different commercial banks.  According to Budget and Appropriations Committee chairman Robert Mbatia, only four of the 27 accounts at the commercial banks were approved by the assembly.  The law requires the House to approve opening of the county’s accounts. But Governor Mike Sonko yesterday clarified that most of the accounts were opened long before devolution and said they were not secret.  “Most of these accounts were opened long ago for our developers who were channeling money to them [accounts] for the projects they sponsored,” he said. Sonko said his administration will close unnecessary bank accounts.
