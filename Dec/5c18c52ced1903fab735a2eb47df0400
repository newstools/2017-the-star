Primary school heads, secondary and college principals will not serve in one institution for over nine years, the Teachers Service Commission has announced. Chief Executive Officer Nancy Macharia further said on Tuesday that deputy heads will not work in the same institution for more than six years. TSC has also banned localisation of teachers. "The sole aim is to avoid conflict of interest," Macharia said in Mombasa during the 13th annual meeting of primary school heads. The CEO said head teachers and their deputies will henceforth be required to hold a Bachelors degree in Education. "For principals and their deputies, they must hold Masters degree in Education," she said. There are 23,000 head teachers and 8,500 secondary principals. Technical training institutes and teacher training colleges are headed by 105 principals. On Monday, Education CS Fred Matiang’i dissolved boards of primary and secondary schools sharing a compound and said they will have one principal and two deputies. “The move will occasion harmony and synergy in the utilisation of resources and infrastructure facilities, some of which lie defunct because resources are duplicated, and institutions compartmentalised, creating non-functional facilities," he said.
