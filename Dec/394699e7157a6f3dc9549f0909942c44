A woman claiming to be the second wife of former Belgut MP Eric Keter has now moved to court to stop the burial of the legislator. In her sworn affidavit, Rosemary Koros wants the court to stop the family from moving ahead with the burial preparations until the matter is heard and determined. In her application before Bomet resident magistrate Maurine Nyigei, Koros said she got married legally, under Kipsigis traditions, to Keter in 1996 as a second wife and they have four children. Charles Cheruiyot, who is son of the first wife, has been named the first respondent while his mother Rebecca Chebii is the second respondent and Lee Funeral Home, where the body is, as the third respondent. In the directions certified as urgent issued on Monday, the magistrate granted temporary orders to the applicant restraining the respondents jointly from removing and transporting the body from Lee Funeral Home. The matter has been set for inter partes hearing on Friday. Koros in her application further claims she learned of the burial arrangements through the media as if she had no relations with the deceased, who was her husband which she notes was unusual and unacceptable in Kipsigis customs.
