Early one morning after driving into the park through the East gate, I drove down towards the Athi basin. It was a beautiful day and the air was crisp and clear with no dust, after some time I came to the edge of where the road drops into the Athi basin. It has always been a good point to view the entire valley, with the Athi dam on the left and the riverine forest below and very often much wildlife visible on the plains below. Then just as I drove up to the viewing point, suddenly I saw 2 black blacked jackals in the road, they seems to be distracted by something on my left, then, wow!!! it was a lioness with three small cubs just a few meters from the roadside, the cubs were hiding in the long grass. Perhaps they did not like the sound of the vehicle. After waiting and watching them for about 15 minutes, the cubs began to relax and started being adventurous, suddenly they ran across the road in front of me as the jackals ran away from them. The lioness stayed next to a fresh Kongoni  (Cokes hartebeest)  kill that looked fresh, the cubs looked like they had already had a good feast during the night. They were now in a joyful mood and played many games, however many of the games that cubs ‘play” prepare them for hunting skills as they mature. Eventually the lioness began to call them with a soft roar, within seconds the little leo trio responded and came running back to the relative safety of their mother. The sound of another vehicle approaching seemed to scare the cubs and they ran across the road again to seek refuge in the dense shrubs.
