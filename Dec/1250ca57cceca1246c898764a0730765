Adelle Onyango is making major moves in London, trying as hard as she can to represent her country and show people what Africa is made of. She has been in London for a few days now, as she was chosen to be part of the panel at the Children's Media Global Summit (CGMS) for the 2017 edition, which was curated by the BBC. One of the topics she was covering was about the impact of social media on future generations. Apart from the serious issues, she also had the privilege of meeting the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Middleton. She took to social media to express her joy as she shared with her fans what she had talked about with the Duchess. She wrote: "So this happened today. I met and had a conversation with the Duchess (of Cambridge) - Kate Middleton! Gaaaaa!!! We spoke about cyber bullying, cultural differences between Kenya and the UK, content creation for digital platforms and how young Africans are reclaiming & redefining the African narrative!" Other invited speakers she got to interact with were Botswana writer Siyanda Mohutsiwa, Sam Walker, Prof Sonia Livingstone, Susan McLean and Tessy Ojo. Adelle has been an inspiration to many young women who are hungry to make it in life, and she has proved that women can make it in a male-dominated world.
