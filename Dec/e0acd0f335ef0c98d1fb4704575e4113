 Jubilee politicians were on Tuesday booed by hostile mourners during the funeral of 16 people who died in a road accident in Vihiga. Water CS Eugene Wamalwa was unceremoniously forced out of a Maragoli festival in Mbale while Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi had to cut off his speech at the funeral because of hostile mourners. Sudi had been sent by Deputy President William Ruto to represent him at the funeral of 16 people who perished in a road accident at the Kamukuywa Bridge along the Kitale -Webuye road early this month.  The MP irked the mourners when he asked residents to ignore NASA leader Raila Odinga. Raila and NASA co-principal Musalia Mudavadi had addressed the mourners and left for another function when Sudi spoke.  Mourners started shouting at him. Sudi said he had Sh500,000 for the bereaved families. The money was given by Ruto. “I did not see ‘Baba’ giving any help,”Sudi said.  “No matter how loud you shout, Jubilee is in control. Nothing is going to change.” The mourners’ hostility grew, forcing Sudi to exit the podium.  “How do you give Sh500,000 to 16 families that have lost their loved ones yet you buy a few goats at an auction for millions of shillings? Isn’t that mockery?” Emuhaya MP Omboko Milemba said.
