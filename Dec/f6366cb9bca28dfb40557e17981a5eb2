A KCPE candidate living with albinism has sent a passionate plea to well-wishers to enable him to join the Maseno School. Abraham Barasa overcame odds and scored 380 marks in the exam that earned him a place in the prestigious school. Another candidate with albinism, Goldalyn Kakuya from Kakamega, was the top student in the country after scoring 455 out of a possible 500 marks. Barasa said he had hoped to score over 400 marks but faced some challeges that hindered his dream. “ I come from a poor background. I am appealing to any good Samaritan to support my education to enable me to achieve my dreams of becoming a lawyer,” he said. Barasa’s mother, Christine Nafula, said she is a vegetable seller at Kemodo market and her husband is a bicycle rider whose daily income is Sh150.
