A man has been convicted of killing his father at Bulukhombe village, Vihiga, after a quarrel over gold deposits in their farm. Anthony Khanyaha was found guilty of murdering Thomas Salala on July 6, 2014. High Court judge Ruth Sitati said she was satisfied that having known the drunken state of his father, Situeti must have known that the beating he gave him was likely to cause death or grievous harm to him. “The prosecution has proved that Khanyaha assaulted Salala with malice aforethought and his conduct was reckless,” Sitati said. The judge said she was satisfied that Joseph Sabara was a truthful and candid witness, whose testimony had not been displaced by sworn evidence given by the accused. “I am aware of the fact that the only person who witnessed the incident was Sabara, a brother to the deceased, and as a court there is need to exercise caution when basing a conviction of an accused upon such evidence,” she said. Sabara testified that he saw Khanyaha beating his father with a spade until it broke. The witness pleaded with him to stop but was warned of dire consequences. He then went to the village elder to report him.  The village elder said it was late and promised to act the next day.  “I went back to the village elder the next morning and she promised to visit the scene,” he said. “The accused also went and reported to the village elder that his father had died.” The chief and police were called to the scene and they collected the body. It came out during cross examination of Sabara that both the accused and the deceased were drunk and that there was some disagreement over gold deposits on their farm.
