 Natural Resources PS Margaret Mwakima has urged investors to follow environment rules to ensure peaceful coexistence with locals.  Speaking on Thursday during a three-day forum in Diani, Kwale, Mwakima said investors had ignored environment laws because of ignorance. “Many investors don’t conduct environmental impact assessment before setting up a firm and this had led to many environmental effects to people and animals,” Mwakima said. “If all of us adhere to proper procedures, we will minimise the adverse impacts on the environment and reduce risks, hazards and vulnerabilities at all stages of the projects,” she said. The forum was attended by representatives from World Wide Fund, National Environmental Management Authority, Base Titanium and county governments.  Mwakima asked county leaders to develop plans consistent with the conservation management strategy.  “These plans will guide our investors in the county. Those going against them will face penalties,” Mwakima said.  She said the government was working on a wildlife conservation strategy that will be finalised in three months.
