Next year’s women’s Football Kenya Premier League will revert to a unified system of play. The league, which came to wrap over the weekend at Camp Toyoyo grounds, has been running on a zonal format for the last two seasons with leaders Zone ‘A’ and ‘B’ leaders battling for the top accolades in a one-legged playoff final. On Sunday, Vihiga Queens, who topped zone ‘B’ out-shined former champions Thika Queens with a well deserved 2-1 win to bag the 2017 bragging rights. Speaking at the event, FKF vice person and women’s committee chairperson, Doris Petra, said plans are underway to ensure the 2018 league is unified. Petra noted the move is to make the league competitive, adding that Division 1 will continue to run on zonal format. “Plans are underway to ensure that next year’s league is unified. It’s unfair, for example that some teams in zone ‘A’ don’t get to play teams in zone ‘B’ and therefore they don’t a chance to gauge themselves against their rivals,” noted Petra. “Having all these teams play against each other we will give them equal opportunity and at the end of it all, the best team will carry the trophy.” Vihiga coach, Alex Alumira, welcomed the move for the league to be unified. He also revealed that they are not going to make additions to the squad since there are many fringe players who were mostly unused during the just concluded campaign. “I am extremely happy that we are the 2017 champions, we had our work well cut out when the season begun. Having all these teams play against each is the best thing that will ever happen to women football because competition will definitely improve,” said Alumira. Vihiga were awarded Sh100,000, Thika bagged Sh70,000 while Oserian received Sh50,000.
