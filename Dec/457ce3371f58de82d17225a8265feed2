School fees for all Kwale students set to join national schools next year are ready and will be paid on January 10, Governor Salim Mvurya has said. Speaking on Tuesday during the Jamhuri Day celebrations in Matuga, Mvurya said all students joining national schools will be 100 per cent sponsored by the county. “There are 3,051 Kwale students in national schools and I have directed the county executive for education to ensure their fees is fully paid for four years,” Mvurya said. The governor praised Ruth Chaka of Bethany Christian Academy, after she emerged the fourth best student nationally in the KCPE exams. “It was a big achievement for the county,” Mvurya said. He attributed the success to the hard work by the county which he said had boosted students’ morale. Mvurya asked residents to coexist peacefully and refuse to be divided along tribal lines. “Everybody is your neighbour irrespective of their tribe. You will need them for help,” he said. His words were echoed by county commissioner Karuku Ngumo. He said they will collaborate with the county for efficient service delivery. Click here for the latest political news
