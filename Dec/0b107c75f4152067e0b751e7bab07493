Leaders from West Pokot county have urged the government to address historical injustices against the community. Led by Deputy Governor Dr Nicholas Atudonyang, they said the region’s communities are marginalised. Speaking in Kapenguria, the leaders said most communities in the Rift Valley suffered during the colonial period and after Independence. Atudonyang said historical injustices aggravated hatred and animosity among communities with border disputes. He said the conflicts have derailed development. “There are many land disputes in this region, yet the government is not committed to address them,” Atodonyang said. He said reconciliation will only come if historical injustices are addressed and justice done. “Pokots have many land problems which need to be addressed ,” Atodonyang said. He urged the government to compensate residents for atrocities committed against them. “Residents are still living in abject poverty. West Pokot region lags behind. We want this to end. We want our peole to be treated like other Kenyans,” he said.
