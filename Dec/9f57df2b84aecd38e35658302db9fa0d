Between
July 2016 and June 2017, 378,397 adolescent girls aged 10-19 were pregnant in
Kenya. This is a
phenomenal figure for schoolgirl pregnancies anywhere, even in much larger
populations such as the United States.  Teenage
pregnancies are defined as pregnancy before the age of 20 years. It is becoming
a huge problem in Kenya and will feed into many other huge problems like the
bad health of the mother and the child inside a bad economy, overpopulation,
disturbed mental health and unemployment.  Primary school pupils are engaging in
sex at an alarming and disturbing rate, the Ministry of Health has said. The
Kenyan girl-child is in trouble from many sides – beginning with her fellow
pupils, the boda boda men who take many to and from schools and a wider variety
of sex pests and predators. What is
to be done? The Kenyan system needs to re-look at the sex education question.
Curriculum textbook education must be supplemented by parental and older sibling
advice in a vast concerted effort. And
impregnators of teenagers should be given extraordinarily swift and stern
justice.
