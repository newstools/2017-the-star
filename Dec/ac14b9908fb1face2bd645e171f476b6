Kisumu Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o has told the High Court in Kisumu that he was unaware of any uncast votes in the August 8 polls.  He said his election was carried out in accordance with the Constitution. Testifying in a petition filed against his victory by former Governor Jack Ranguma, Nyong’o said he was not aware and could not verify why forms 37C of some polling stations showed uncast votes. He added that he did not find out why, but assumed the streams could have been collapsed and joined with others. Ranguma’s lawyer Richard Onsongo had asked Nyong’o whether he was aware that he was declared winner, yet some votes were uncast. Nyong’o said he did not look at forms 37B from the constituencies, hence did not know the entries. He said there were results in relation to the polling stations, as indicated in forms 37A, even if they did not appear in forms 37C. The case resumes on December 20.
