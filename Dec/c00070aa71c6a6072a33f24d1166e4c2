NASA lawmakers advised their leader Raila Odinga not to go ahead with his inauguration as the People’s President because they feared repercussions, a Kiambu MP has said. Raila was to be sworn in today, but the plan was postponed indefinitely. Limuru’s Peter Mwathi (pictured) yesterday said the MPs blamed Raila’s advisers for misleading him to engage in acts that break the law. He said the legislators realised Raila might find himself in trouble and some quietly withdrew from National Resistance Movement’s activities. “ They smelt a rat. They feared he would be arrested and other issues follow,” Mwathi said. “The move to accept engaging in the House business tells you everything. They came and started saying they had seen the light. They need to serve the people who elected them. “Initially, they had rebelled against the House when they were called. Today, they don’t speak of resistance movement or NRM. It’s like they are avoiding it silently.”
