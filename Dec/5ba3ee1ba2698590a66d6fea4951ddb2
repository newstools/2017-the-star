The closest I had come to guns was seeing them in the hands of police on patrol, or breaking up demos — and, of course, in the movies. But last Saturday a pistol was brandished in my face — by a former altar boy. My two-hour drive from Nakuru to Nairobi turned into an eight-hour nightmare of an odyssey with two kidnappers-carjackers. My cousin and I were headed to Nairobi in his car when we stopped in Kinale Forest to answer a call of nature. It was 7pm. I was returning to our car when two men called for help with their car. “Hey, do you guys have a spanner?” one asked. Before I could reply, one lifted his shirt and revealed a pistol. My knees trembled, I raised my hands in surrender. “You need to cooperate and everything will be okay. Walk towards your car and act like everything is normal,” one said. We approached our car, one of them ordered my cousin out. They ordered us into their car (They had placed a hazard nearby.) They emptied our pockets. Inside, the driver was already seated. Earlier he had bent over the bonnet, pretending to fix the car. One of the goons — actually, they were nice — got into our car drove ahead of us. Our car disappeared. They were young and well-built. One noticed I was wearing a rosary and asked if I was Catholic. Not true, but I said yes. “I used to be an altar boy,” he said. I resisted asking how he got into crime. Another asked if I voted in the presidential rerun. I lied and said no, I didn’t have a voter’s card For hours we were driven to Nairobi via feeder roads. At Eastleigh they demanded my cousin’s ATM Pin and forced me to withdraw Sh20,000. We were then driven to Mathare, Ruaraka, Kasarani, Githurai and Kahawa where we stopped. Here they forced my cousin to send them all the money in his M-Pesa account. They took his phone. Shortly before 3am we arrived at Roysambu and, to our relief, they ordered us out. “Go and don’t look back.” A good Samaritan selling coffee helped us home. Click here for the latest political news
