 The Teachers Service Commission has abolished demotion of teachers. Making the announcement yesterday, chairperson Lydia Nzomo (pictured) said the commission will henceforth only focus on progression. She spoke at Sheikh Zayed Children Welfare Centre, Mombasa, during 13th annual primary heads meeting. “Nobody will be reduced from headteacher to classroom tutor. There will be no demotion,” she said. Nzomo said relegation demoralises heads and lower their self-esteem. “How will you address others, walk around knowing you have been downgraded and effectively teach?” she posed. Unlike before when politicians and opinion leaders wielded immense powers in deciding who should be hired or fired, TSC said the role will purely lie with them. “No one will influence your sacking. Headteachers should do their job knowing they are protected,” Nzomo said. Over 10,000 teachers are attending the assembly whose theme is, “Reengineering the Teaching Profession in the 21st Century for Effective Curriculum Implementation”. Nzomo said in the event a teacher excuses himself from his-her current post, they will be deemed to have exited the profession. “In police service, when a corporal becomes OCPD, he will never go back to be a corporal,”  she said. “All these are aimed at professionalising the teaching fraternity,” she added.
