The NCIC wants some sections of the County Government Act changed to allow imposition of hefty penalties on governors who fail to meet the ethnic balance requirements in hiring of county staff. Commissioner Roba Sharamo (pictured) yesterday said governors must be held accountable in their work. The Act provides that 70 per cent of the employees can come from the dominant ethnic group in a county, while 30 per cent must go to the minorities.  Some counties violate the law. For instance, Kirinyaga has 97.3 per cent of Kikuyu employees. “If a governor violates the law and uses public funds to enrich members of one ethnic community or region, he or she will be liable to a penalty of up to Sh10 million,” he said at White Rhino Hotel, Nyeri town, after a training of County Service Board members from 14 counties.  He said some sections of the Act are “very weak” and need to be strengthened. Sharamo said the hefty penalties will also apply to the chairpersons of the County Public Service Boards, “as they also have a role in ensuring the law is complied with”. There have been complaints from the counties concerning bias during recruitments, he said. Similar problems are being experienced in parastatals and public universities and they are a threat to national cohesion, he added.
