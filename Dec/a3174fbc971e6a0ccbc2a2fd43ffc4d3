Octopizzo is clearly making moves in the music industry as he has just revealed that he has been invited to attend the 60th edition of the Grammy Awards 2017. Speaking exclusively to Word Is, Octopizzo revealed he submitted three of his songs for consideration, but unfortunately, he didn't make it for the nominations. "The invitation is very legit. I submitted my songs for consideration in the academy but I didn't make it to the nominations, but I got invited and I will try next year again. I was almost there. I only submitted three songs and I was supposed to submit an album, but I didn't submit it in time and there is a span of time when you are supposed to submit. So you can't submit anytime," he said. Octopizzo mostly shoots his videos abroad and he has managed to work with top talent in the field while there. When asked if any of his songs have been used in movies, he said, "My track 'Black Star' was used in a documentary called Giants of Africa. There is another movie that was shot by a Belgian on refugees and two of my songs were used as soundtracks in that movie."
