The transfer of secondary schools' principals by the Teachers' Service Commission has sparked a huge furore, pitting it against the teachers' unions, politicians and stakeholders. Sober discourse has been replaced by near catcalls across the breadth of Kenyans interested in an efficient and productive education sector.  Coming on the heels of what has been described as "mass examination failure", the "mass transfer" of heads of schools without a clear explanation has raised eyebrows. Ulterior motives are being associated with what should be a smooth and routine exercise. What is going on here?   The Kenya National
Union of Teachers is crying foul. Whose apple-cart has been upset? Is there something unusual in the transfers that the public is not being told? Who is being punished or rewarded and whats the end game? Transfer of teachers and principals is not new in the education system. It is the scale that appears unprecedented and unacceptable. The Ministry of Education must walk hand in hand with stakeholders in its decision-making to reduce the cacophonous friction and feuding over
exam results, employment, transfers, policy formulation and implementation.
