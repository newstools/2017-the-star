North Imenti MP Rahim Dawood has urged DP William Ruto to pick Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi to be his running mate in the 2022 presidential race. He said Kiraitu is a development-oriented leader and his ability is recognised by many people in Meruland and Kenya. Meru residents will be glad and grateful if the Mt Kenya leaders and residents rally their support behind Kiraitu, Dawood said. “When DP Ruto will be seeking the Presidency in 2022, we want you [Kiraitu] to deputise him,” he said. But Murungi steered clear of 2022 politics.  Dawood also praised NASA chief Raila Odinga for shelving his “swearing-in”. In apparent reference to Raila, he added, “Go now and rest and come again in 2022 to compete alongside DP Ruto for the presidency. I’m confident and believe you will not win against Ruto.” Dawood said Raila would have been the president of an association — not Kenya — had he been inaugurated. He also said he has changed his mind and will run for MP again in 2022. Dawood had said he would table a motion in Parliament to lock out two-term MPs from seeking a third term.
