 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been in Europe seeking to have Jerusalem declared the capital of Israel. President Trump did that last week and said the United States will move its embassy to Jerusalem. However Jerusalem is under a separate Special International Regime according to the 1947 United Nations resolution that recommended the creation of independent Jewish and Arab states in Palestine.  If the world community no longer recognises that special status of Jerusalem, the UN resolution will effectively be invalidated and the legitimacy of Israel itself thrown into question. The Middle East peace process will implode. A right wing government in Israel is not worried about that risk of confrontation, nor about the long-term consequences of annexing further Palestinian territory through continuing new settlements. The European Union should advise Netanyahu that they cannot move their embassies from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem until there is a two state solution that recognises Jerusalem as a shared capital for both Israel and Palestine. And Kenya should adopt the same position if Israel asks.
