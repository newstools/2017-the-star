Six women and their six daughters were arrested in Chekomos, West Pokot, after the girls were forcibly circumcised.  However another girl, who was also cut, escaped when Kenya Police Reservists raided their homes on Thursday morning. The girls are below 15. Sook division assistant commissioner Brian Njue said he received intelligence reports about the circumcision.  “In the Pokot community not everyone supports female genital mutilation. The few people who don’t support the practice brought the report,” he said. Njue said FGM is prevalent in West Pokot county at 75 per cent. He said three out of four girls undergo the cut. Njue, together with the reservists and the assistant chief, ambushed the parents and arrested them.  The women were taken to Kapenguria police station. The girls are at Kapenguria Referral Hospital receiving treatment. Njue said they have been conducting barazas and holding dialogue in the community to educate people on the hazards of the outlawed practice. He warned parents against forcing their girls to be circumcised.  “If found guilty the suspects face a jail term of seven years. This will serve as an example to parents who force their girls to undergo the cut. If deterrent measures are not taken, we will not win the war on FGM,” Njue said. He expects more perpetrators to be arrested. There is rampant circumcision of girls, especially during the school holidays.  West Pokot OCPD Anthony Wanjuu said the suspects would be taken to the Kapenguria law courts to face charges. He said the girls are in stable condition. They will also appear in court as evidence.
