 Tax chief John Njiraini has termed baseless a suit that seeks to have him sent on compulsory leave pending retirement. Njiraini also told the court yesterday he has not sought an extension of his contract as the Commissioner General of the Kenya Revenue Authority beyond the stipulated expiry date, contrary to claims by activist Okiya Omtatah. Omtatah accused the taxman of failing to send Njiraini on terminal leave pending his retirement, further claiming the commissioner is quietly scheming to have his tenure extended. But Njiraini has dismissed the claims, saying his appointment to the office is well founded in law and that his term will come to an end in March 2018. He said the case by Omtatah is speculative as he has not applied for any extension, neither has the KRA board made any public pronouncement of its intention to renew his term. “This court should not countenance false allegations made without any basis to embarrass and demean me,” he said. Njiraini was appointed on March 4, 2015 for a term of three years. “According to the contract that I signed with the KRA board of directors, it is expressly provided that my engagement with the KRA is for a period of three years commencing March 4 , 2015 and that period is set to expire March 3 , 2018,” he said. Njiriani also said whereas Omtatah is entitled to access justice in the courts, he has failed to demonstrate and particularise how his appointment has infringed on anyone’s right.
