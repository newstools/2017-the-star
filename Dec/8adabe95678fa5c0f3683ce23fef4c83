The National
Cereals and Produce Board has denied claims by farmers it is
buying imported maize from influential traders pretending to be local
producers. The farmers
yesterday protested at the board's depot in Eldoret. They said the importers are given priority by the board in both delivery and payment. "We are
surprised that there are two queues for those delivering maize at the depot in
Eldoret. One for genuine farmers and another one for
importers," Kenya Farmers Association director Kipkorir Menjo said. He said
importers are delivering maize in containers and their queue is being cleared
faster than that of local farmers. But board spokesman
Titus Maiyo said they are still processing the subsidised
government maize brought in from Mexico. "We still have
small quantities of the subsidised maize at the port and that is what the NCPB
is processing and forwarding to the millers," he said. He said the
lorries ferrying the maize are only allowed into the depots for clearing of
documents, after which the maize is not offloaded but redirected to millers. Maiyo said farmers
should not be worried of any unscrupulous business at the board. But Menjo and
other farmers' representatives met with the Uasin Gishu Agriculture executive Samwel Yego and asked him to ensure there is only one queue for
farmers at the board. “We don’t want to
hear of two queues at the NCPB. Those with any other maize should take it
elsewhere and stop frustrating farmers,” Menjo said. Yego said the
county would take up the complaints from the farmers and forward the same to the
relevant authorities.
