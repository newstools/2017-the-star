Rogue Public Service Vehicle operators have been warned against hiking fares during the festive season. Coast region Matatu Owners Association cordinator Saalim Mbarak asked passengers to report saccos that have increased fares. Mbarak said they have received complaints about hiked fares, some more than doubled. "We are asking commuters to resist saccos that have increased fares," Mbarak told the Star on the phone yesterday. PSV operators are minting millions of shillings from raised fares as people travel to link up with relatives during the Christmas holiday. In some places, fares have been tripled. Mbarak said the excess proceeds do not end up in the pockets of vehicle owners. "What vehicle owners get is their ordinary day's share or even less," Mbarak said. There has been an influx of visitors in Mombasa as tourists flock to the Coast. Most of them are unaware of fares. PSV operators capitalise on their ignorance. Residents caught up in the mess have protested. "We have been informed that fare from Mombasa CBD to the Pirates Beach is now Sh200 from the normal Sh60," Mbarak said "We urge travelers to record the vehicles' registration numbers together with their saccos and report the matter to the nearest police station." Mbarak said police will summon the sacco and order it to present the driver and conductor for punishment. Mbarak urged police to help passengers traveling over long distances, saying inter-county PSVs were also exploiting travelers. He cited the Mombasa-Kilifi route where fares had been increased from Sh200 to Sh700. "This and Mombasa-Pirate route are the most notorious," Mbarak said. The matatu operators said they hike fares in readiness for the low season that follows after December. They say the profits will cushion them during the low season.
