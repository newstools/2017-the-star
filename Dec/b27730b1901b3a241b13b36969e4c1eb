Four Jubilee lawmakers have moved to court to challenge the party's decision to revoke their committee positions. They are Alfred Keter (Nandi Hills), Silas Kipkoech (Moiben), David Bowen (Marakwet East) and James Gakuya (Embakasi North). The four argue that Chief Whip Benjamin Washiali's decision was unreasonable, irrational. They further say the decision was without notice and that it infringed on their constitutional rights to fair action and hearing. Tiren, Keter, Kangogo and Alex Kosgey of Emgwen were recalled from committees after they defied President Uhuru Kenyatta’s directive on his preferred lineup. The so-called rebels are said to have colluded with NASA lawmakers to contest committee leadership. A storm is brewing in Jubilee after a section of Rift Valley MPs came to the defense of the four.
