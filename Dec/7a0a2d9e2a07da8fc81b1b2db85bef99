Rapper Timmy Tdat is saddened by the fact that he doesn't get the money collected by MCSK (Music Copyright Society of Kenya) for his music. Talking exclusively to Word Is, Tdat, who is currently ruling the airwaves with the song We'll Be Ok, expressed his feelings: “MCSK wanacollect pesa hadi saa hii but we never get it. Straight up, hatuipati na watu wanalipa, na wasipolipa tunapigiwa simu ati wameshikwa na makarao.” Dela added: “Wanajua sana kucollect but sisi kutufikia haitufikii.” The Dus Nyau hitmaker says we should celebrate our own and feed Kenyans with music close to home. “The other thing is what we feed guys. Kitambo nilikua naambiwa submit your video. But when does Wizkid submit his video? People should just support their own. If you play Kenyan and tell fans that it is hot, they will know this is hot. The same fan akikam na aambiwe Dela ndio dem mkali saa hii, forget Beyonce, watajua huyu ndo mbaya.” Dela on the other hand pointed out countries that have been playing their own, as Kenya struggles with western music. “Hiyo kitu ya 70 per cent inafaa i-happen juu ukienda Tanzania, Uganda and Nigeria, that is what happens.” Tdat, who seemed really angry, urged those who wanted to see Riri to just head to YouTube. “If you want to see Rihanna, go to YouTube, you are a Kenyan. This cake is big.”
