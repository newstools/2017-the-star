Some 12 youth graduates of the KCB 2jiajiri program have clinched jobs with Toyota Kenya after graduating from the one year learning program. “Rise above the ordinary and now that you have got into the academy, you will be able to benchmark and create world class enterprises for yourselves and other generations to come," group chief executive officer and MD, KCB Bank group Joshua Oigara said during the graduation program. The 2jiajiri Initiative is a program that gives young people the opportunity to acquire skills that they can use to build and better themselves and be able to create job opportunities for other young people. They have partnered with the Toyota academy to give the engineering students first-hand experience into the market. "I would call it the Africa for Africans initiative and I hope the partnership will continue so that we can keep growing the youths to be better and to be able to help them establish themselves and develop their SMEs at large in the long run,” vice chairman Toyota Kenya limited,Toyoki Kuno said. 2jiajiri program has 10,000 beneficiaries across the country. Since last year 2,234 students have graduated and 518 of them have benefitted by being able to start their own businesses from the skills they acquired while others got absorbed into other organizations.
