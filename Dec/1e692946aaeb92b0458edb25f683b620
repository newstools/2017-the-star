Amani National Congress has settled on Lugari MP Ayub Savula (pictured) for the Kakamega governor position in 2022. Governor Wycliffe Oparanya (ODM) is serving his second and final term in office.Pressing Savula’s bid by the party is seen as early plans by ANC, headed by NASA co-principal Musalia Mudavadi, to snatch the county stewardship from ODM. During the hotly contested August 8 polls, ANC won 11 of the 33 parliamentary seats. ODM and Jubilee tied at eight seats each, while Ford Kenya managed five seats. Bumula elected an independent candidate. Speaking during the burial of Patrick Sambula in Mumias West on Saturday, Matungu MP Justus Murunga (ANC) said party-elected leaders endorsed Savula as their candidate to replace Oparanya. “As ANC we have decided that Savula is the best suited among all that have shown interest to replace Oparanya and that is why I am marketing him here,” Murunga said. Other politicians eyeing the top county job include former Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale who lost to Oparanya in the August 8 polls. Shinyalu MP Justus Kizito has also declared an interest in the seat even as he battles a petition challenging his August 8 victory. Surgeon Stanley Khainga is also interested in the post. Observers say 2022 campaigns are premature and those already on the campaign trail will burn out before the real race.
