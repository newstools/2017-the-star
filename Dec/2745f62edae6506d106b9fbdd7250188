Primary school head teachers trooped to Mombasa on Saturday for their annual convention which will go on until Thursday next week. KPSHA chairman Shem Ndolo said the theme of the meeting will be "Re-engineering 21st Century Curriculum Reforms". The meeting comes in the wake of state's plan to abolish the 8-4-4 system of education which was established in 1985. This will be replaced by 2-6-6-3 education curriculum framework starting next year following pilots in selected schools since May. Over 10,000 teachers will converge at Sheikh Zeid Hall to discuss the prospects of this change. The meeting was initially set for August but was rescheduled to November due to the national elections. November being an examination month, Kepsha leadership pushed the convention to December 2. "The country has stabilised from the election uncertainties. We believe the meeting will be a success," Ndolo told journalists on Saturday. "We have been assured of maximum security in Mombasa for the week-long sessions." The KPSHA chair commended head teachers for the good management of the KCPE examination whose results were released recently. "The head teachers did the country proud," he said. A total of 9,846 pupils scored 400 marks and above, a major improvement from last year where only 5,190 candidates scored reached the 400-point mark. A total of 993,718 students sat the exams in various schools. Goldalyn Kakuya, this year's best candidate, scored an impressive 455 out 500 marks.
