Lenana School has invited applications from 2017 KCPE pupils who scored 380 marks and above and wish to be day scholars. Principal William Kemei on Saturday said this is in line with the Ministry of Education’s directive for selected national schools within the city to open day wing classes. “We were given 45 slots. There are so many who have already applied even before we put out the notice,” he said. Applicants must live in the city, preferably in Dagoretti, Westlands, Kibra and Lang’ata subcounties or any other accessible area within Nairobi county.
