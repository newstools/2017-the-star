Commercial Bank of Africa, the operators of the M-Shwari mobile banking platform for M-Pesa customers, has apologised to customers over last weekend’s system failure. In a statement on Friday, the group’s managing director Isaac Awuondo said the M-Shwari services were restored on Monday. “We would like to take this opportunity to sincerely apologise to our customers for the M-Shwari service outage, which started on Saturday, December 23 at 11.30pm to Monday, December 25 at 10 pm,” he said. Awuondo said the bank values customers and recognises the importance of the M-Shwari service.  He said on December 23 at 4 pm, CBA noted technical problems with the M-Shwari service. "After comprehensive consultations, we resolved to undertake emergency maintenance activities to our systems," Awuondo said. “Due to a high volume of transactions, the maintenance service ended much later than previously planned.” CBA said during the process, it was noted that 17,700 M-Shwari customers’ who opened new Savings and Lock Savings Accounts on December 22, were assigned new account numbers, different from the ones set up when they initially opened their accounts. “This has raised understandable concerns in both the media and on social media, and I would like to assure our customers that we are resolving this issue as a priority,” he said.
