The ruling in a petition against Kisumu Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o will be made in January, the High Court in Kisumu has said. During the hearing yesterday, justice David Majanja said the court will rely on the submissions before it to arrive at a final determination of the case. He said he will give notice of the judgment date. Former Governor Jack Ranguma filed a petition challenging Nyong’o’s victory.Several witnesses testified in the case. In his affidavit, Ranguma wants the victory overturned, arguing the governor election was conducted, administered and managed poorly by the IEBC. He accused Nyong’o of conspiring with the electoral agency to rig him out in the polls. He claimed there were a myriad electoral malpractices during voting and transmission of the results.  Nyong’o through lawyers James Orengo and Antony Oluoch maintains the election was done according to the Constitution. Ranguma told the court his agents were denied access to various polling stations and the tallying centre.
