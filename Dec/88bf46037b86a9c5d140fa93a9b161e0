More snow is hitting the UK with an amber weather warning issued across large parts of the country. The Met Office says there will be heavy snow across Wales, the Midlands, northern and eastern England, warning that rural areas could become "cut off". It predicts around 10cm will fall, with up to 20cm on higher ground. Warnings are also in place for snow in Scotland and Northern Ireland, and for high winds in the south. Southern parts of England and Wales face heavy rain and gale force winds of up to 70mph (112km/h), the Met Office said, with icy surfaces likely to be an "additional hazard". Temperatures are also likely to reach lows of -10C (14F) in some parts of Scotland and Wales, falling to as low as -14C (6.8F) in isolated rural areas. Highways England has asked drivers to prepare for "any eventuality", making sure to have warm clothing, food, drink, required medications, boots, a shovel and a torch if venturing out. Traffic Scotland also advised drivers to increase their stopping distances in the icy conditions and take a de-icer and scraper with them. In the Midlands, many motorways are already covered in snow, with local police forces asking people to only travel if absolutely necessary. In north Wales, some hospitals have drafted in 4x4 drivers to get staff to and from work and the Red Cross have been asked to help move blood supplies and other medical equipment.
