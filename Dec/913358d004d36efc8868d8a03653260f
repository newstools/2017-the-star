A section of opposition MCA's have vowed to work with governor Sonko to ensure service delivery to the people. This is after a group of over 20 MCA's affiliated to the NASA coalition were accorded a VIP treat at governor Sonko's Mua home. The MCA's were hosted to a dinner on Saturday before they were awarded with food stuffs, clothing and other social amenity items to deliver to their wards. After the dinner, the MCA's said they will bury their political discord with Jubilee government and join hands with Sonko to better lives of Nairobians. "Sonko is a godly person who does not fear individuals but has respect human life and has no boundaries in terms of service deliver why can't we give him the support he needs to deliver leadership that Nairobi deserves," one of the MCA's who sought anonymity said. The MCA said, "For me am willing to work round the clock in my ward to change the political misconceptions between NASA and Jubilee politics. It is jubilee that is has the majority in Nairobi, all we can do is shelve our ambitions as a party and focus on collaborating our efforts to service delivery," she said. Sources closer to the governor told the Star that he has vowed to embark on a door to door political re-alignment especially among the opposition leadership to ensure that Nairobi is a 100+1 percent Jubilee. According to the source, Sonko said he has no political wars with any individual including those in opposition. This move is to ensure that all leaders within Nairobi are tasked to deliver in accordance with the governors manifesto," the source said.
