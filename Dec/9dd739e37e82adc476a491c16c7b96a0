The Kenya Urban Roads Authority has ordered traders along Outer Ring Road to vacate to allow smooth flow of traffic. The Sh9.3 billion expansion project is currently at 87 per cent, with the main carriageway completed and opened. Kura director general Silas Kinoti said notices have been issued to the traders. Demolitions “Sections of the service roads, including the left-hand side of Mutindwa Market and right-hand side section between Taj Mall and Pipeline Estate, are being finalised to accommodate service lanes,” he said. Operations next to Mutindwa Market commenced at the weekend and stalls erected on land meant for service lanes demolished. Completion of outstanding work, including footbridges, street lighting, landscaping, construction of fresh produce market at Kagundo Road Junction and construction of service roads is ongoing. Value for money “The contractor is set to start working on footbridges in January and is expected to [have] completed by April 2018,” Kinoti said. “We have observed with concern that motorists park along the road, including the median section initially preserved for development of Bus Rapid Transport.” Kura is installing guard rails to prevent vehicles from accessing the BRT. In addition the BRT corridor is being landscaped to make it neat and discourage dumping. Grass has been planted. Kinoti said the project is designed to have bus stops for efficiency. He said once completed, the road will be a masterpiece that will give the public value for its money. The contractor is also putting up bicycle lanes and footpaths for pedestrians.
