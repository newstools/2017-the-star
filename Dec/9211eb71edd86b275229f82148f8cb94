The ASA co-principals should chart their own political course because coalition leader Raila Odinga will stand for president in 2022, Lugari MP Ayub Savula has said. Raila is largely expected to sit out the 2022 race and instead endorse one of the coalition’s co-principals.  But Savula, on Wednesday, said he had credible information that the former Prime Minister will make a fifth attempt for the presidency in 2022, with Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho as his running mate. “As Luhyas, we must begin early preparations to front ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi for the presidency in 2022, instead of waiting for Raila to hand over the mantle to him. Joho’s brother has told me that Raila and Joho will be on the ballot,” Savula said. He did not give the name of Joho’s brother who made the disclosure. He was speaking during a meeting at Jaminda Hotel in Kakamega town.  Savula said Luhyas had decided to back Mudavadi for the country’s top political seat in 2022.  “We resolved that Mudavadi should immediately delink from Raila and start preparations for his own bid.  We  will meet in January to chart the way forward,” Savula said. He told Mudavadi to move fast and initiate his own presidential bid, failing which they will rally behind another person. “We have decided to go for power ourselves in 2022,” Savula said.
