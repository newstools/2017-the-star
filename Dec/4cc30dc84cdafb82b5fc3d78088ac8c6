Petitioners challenging the election of Governor Mohamed Mahamud on grounds he is not qualified for the seat have demanded explanations for his failure to testify in court. This was raised by lawyer Ombati Omwanza after the court concluded taking testimonies from all the witnesses on Friday. "Why is the governor not turning up in court and defend his election victory. Is it because he will be embarrassed before court on his questionable academic qualification?" The governor swore an affidavit in response to the case where is represented by lawyer Tom Macharia who said it was not important because the county's boss' agents represented him. "Section 57 of the Election Regulations creates the position of chief agents in all constituencies. Since the chief agent has testified, there is no need for the governor to appear in court and testify even though he swore an affidavit," Macharia said. Following the governors failure to appear, the court directing the parties in the case to file their submissions on December 13. During the proceedings, a Jubilee agent told the High court that ex-Wajir governor Ahmed Abdullahi lied that elections in the county were not free and fair. Mohammed Abbas said there was no voter bribery as alleged by the former county boss adding that he monitored voting throughout the day. The agent, in his testimony, said his work was to monitor the voting process and the results transmission. He said forms 37B were being used to announce the results. Abdullahi, with another petitioner Mahamed Abdi, want the court to nullify Mahamud's victory in the August 8 general election on grounds the governor is not qualified.
