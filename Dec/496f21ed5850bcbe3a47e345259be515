Safaricom has launched Mpesa services for the visually impaired customers as part of celebrations to mark the International Day of Persons with Disabilities.  A world first, the new service will mean that customers can now access the mobile money services by dialing 234, then selecting the “Mpesa services” option, followed by the “Mpesa balance” option. This will then allow customers to enter their PIN and have their balances read out to them. Previously, visually impaired customers transacting on the service have had to depend on the assistance of other persons to make transactions. This has exposed them to the risk of being defrauded in the process, and also meant that they sometimes have to reveal their PINs to other people. “Tremendous gains lie in being able to enhance the ability to integrate persons with disabilities into every aspect of political, social, economic and cultural life,” said Joseph Ogutu, director of strategy at Safaricom. The platform will initially allow customers to query their Mpesa balances, with additional services gradually being introduced in coming months. By accessing M-PESA through an interactive voice response platform, customers can now ascertain their M-PESA balances before and after making transactions. Safaricom involved a focus group consisting of visually impaired customers in development and review of the service. The service has been made possible through Safaricom’s investment in a voice biometric platform. The new platform will allow the firm to innovate around a number of its services by enabling customers to voice–interact with a number of services.  Safaricom is also implementing a number of programs that will allow visually impaired customers to access smartphones at more affordable price points.  The devices enable customers to access mobile services and applications through voice recognition software. This empowers visually impaired smartphone users to further unlock the value of mobile technology.
