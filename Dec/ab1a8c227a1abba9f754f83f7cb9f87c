 Laikipia county is offering incentives to students to raise the enrolment in technical and vocational training institutes. Some institutions face the risk of closure because of poor enrolment. The county has set aside Sh16 million for bursaries for at least 2,000 students who will join the colleges next year. “The eight Vocational Training Institutes are expected to imparting meaningful and sustainable skills for employment to our youth,” a statement from Governor Ndiritu Muriithi’s office said yesterday. He said the institutions will be refurbished, their workshops equipped and hostels build to improve learning conditions.  “We are recruiting trainers and tutors for these institutions and are linking them with industries for relevant skills uptake, internship and technology transfer. All these are aimed at bringing their quality of training to a world class level,” Muriithi said. The county government will conduct a market survey to identify what skills are in demand to align the institutes’ courses accordingly.
