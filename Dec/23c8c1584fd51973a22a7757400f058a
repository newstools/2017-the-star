Tension is high in Chemoe, Baringo North Sub-county after suspected Pokot bandits raided and made away with 38 cows on Saturday. Tuluk Sub-location Assistant Chief Moses Kaptum said the stolen animals belong to Tugen residents Abraham Chelal, Kaiwale Chesaket and Elijah Chepkunur. “They also exchanged fire with the ASTU officers but overpowered them,” Kaptum said.

Chemoe resident Richard Chepchomei regretted the incident urging the government to tighten security patrols along the Tugen-Pokot border to prevent the aggressors, especially during the December holiday. “We had earlier alerted the police over the Pokot threats to attack anytime, but they neglected it, so you can now see the outcome,” Chepchomei said. The attack comes a week after Baringo County Commissioner Peter Okwanyo held a peace meeting at Chemoe bringing together the warring Pokot and Tugen communities. During the meeting, Okwanyo ordered Pokot Assistant Chief for Kositei Sub-location Jackson Ronei to produce the stolen livestock and the names of the armed bandits behind frequent attacks. “I am giving you only two weeks to produce the names else tough action shall be taken against you,” warned Okwanyo. The raid also occurs amid the ongoing clashes between the armed Turkana and Pokot pastoral communities in Kapedo and Nadome along the border of Baringo County and Turkana East Sub-county.
