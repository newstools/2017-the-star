Mount Kenya Youth Caucus has urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to retain Lands CS Jacob Kaimenyi in the Cabinet. Led by chairman Linford Mutembei, the leaders said Kaimenyi has been unifying leader. "We want a unifying leader and we are supporting Kaimenyi as he fits the credential," he said. Mutembei spoke to the Star in Meru town on Friday. He opposed a proposal that former Meru Governor Peter Munya be given the slot. "We all know the squabbles that were witnessed in Meru because of Munya and Governor Kiraitu Murungi rivalry. We do not want a repeat," Mutembei said. Munya has filed to withdraw a case challenging the election of Kiraitu as governor, triggering talks he could have been promised a Cabinet Secretary post. Munya also seems to have buried the hatchet between him and Kiraitu. The two embraced each other after Munya filed an application to withdraw the case on Monday. Mutembei said Kaimenyi is the best bet for Uhuru as a Cabinet Secretary. He said Kaimenyi has issued more than three million title deeds to Kenyans and has brought reforms in the Lands ministry. "He has also helped solve disputes between Meru-Isiolo and Meru-Tharaka Nithi counties," Mutembei said. He also proposed that the President appoints a Cabinet Secretary from Nyambene or Tharaka Nithi if possible. President Uhuru Kenyatta has told Cabinet Secretaries to prepare for changes as he reconstitutes his Cabinet in January. Uhuru promised Munya a state appointment if he withdrew his petition against Kiraitu.
