Gospel singer Nicah The Queen is one beautiful woman who has given men sleepless nights with her banging body. For such a beauty, her DMs must be crazy, but apparently that's not the case. In an interview with Word Is, Nicah said that as much as she is beautiful, she has never
received anything freaky. "I think people
who view your page and see how you are dressed and what you post, that's
when they can start DMing you crazy stuff. When all you are quoting is the
Bible, encouragement stuff and posting decent photos, I don't think
people will DM you those things. The only thing I get is like: you are
very beautiful, some want to take me out for lunch, but sijawai pata
extreme things. If you pose naked you will get sexual attention." Nicah
also talked about how people have always attacked her songs, saying that
they are encouragement songs not gospel. She acknowledges that she is
not perfect and she sins like everyone else, she is just saved by grace.
People just assume she doesn't get hurt. Nicah recently released a brand new song called Naringa, which already has over five thousand views on YouTube.
