Malindi fishermen and fishmongers operating in Mayungu have disagreed on the presence of fishermen from Pemba, Tanzania, in the area. A group yesterday accused security officers of harassing the Tanzanians. They said the officers hurt their businesses. The more than 500 fishermen and fishmongers protested against arbitrary arrests of their counterparts. They alleged that KDF, Regular Police and AP officers have been searching for foreign fishermen and have arrested more than 50 Tanzanians and some locals in two operations. Another group want the Tanzanian fishermen to go back to their country. It supports the security officers for arresting the “foreigners”. They are involved in illegal fishing, the rival group said. It accused the Tanzanians of taking over the industry through their large vessels, despite lacking work permits. Tension remains high as the feuding parties seek to have their way. Leaflets warning the Tanzanians to leave or “face dire consequences” have been circulated. They are reportedly from the Mayungu committee. The Pembas usually travel to Kenya for fishing once or twice a year for about three to four months.
