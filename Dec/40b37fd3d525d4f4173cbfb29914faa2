The government will spend Sh500 million to make Nakuru-Eldoret highway a dual carriageway. Roads Principal Secretary John Mosonik said the construction will begin in January or February and will take six months. "We will have to divert the Sh500 million meant for other projects for construction of a dual carriageway to minimise the number of accidents at the deadly spot." He addressed the press on Wednesday after touring the Sachangwan spot where at least 60 people died in a grisly accident of more than 15 vehicles on Tuesday. He was with Kenyan National Highways Authority officials and Nakuru Governor Lee Kinyanjui.

The PS asked all road users to avoid speeding and overtaking, especially in danger zones. "I appeal to all drivers to help prevent accidents " he said, and added more road blocks will be erected by police and NTSA so cars are checked thoroughly. Mosonik said the ministry will also consider diverting vehicles bound for Kericho to the Njoro-Molo route, and those heading to Eldoret to Kabarak-Ravine road, to ease congestion during the festive season. He recommended that an older road bypassing the main one be opened soon. Click here for the latest political stories
