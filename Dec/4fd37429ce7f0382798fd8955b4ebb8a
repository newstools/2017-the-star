Police in Ol Kalou are holding a 34-year-old man for
allegedly killing his wife. The man from Gichungo village is said to have smashed his
wife’s head with a piece of wood on Sunday evening. The victim is 28-year-old and a mother of three.
The oldest child is 11 years, while the youngest is three months old.  Her name
could not be revealed as her parents have not been notified. The husband was rescued by police from a mob that wanted to lynch him. Nyandarua
Central police boss Wilson Kosgei yesterday said the motive of the murder is
not yet known. He said the man quarrelled with his wife on 6pm on Sunday. She
was rescued by neighbours who rushed her to JM Memorial Hospital, where she was referred
to the Nakuru General Hospital for specialised treatment.  “Unfortunately she died,” Kosgei said. He said the couple has been having disputes and the
area assistant chief and village elders have been involved in solving their
feuds several times. Kosgei said this is the second incident a man has killed
his wife in Ol kalou in less than two weeks.  Two weeks ago, a Nyandarua county
employee was arrested after his wife was brutally murdered. Kosgei urged residents to learn to solve their differences without
resulting to violance.  “There is no reason to go that far. If
couples are fed up with other, the prudent thing is to separate,” he
said.
