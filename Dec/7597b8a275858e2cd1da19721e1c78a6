KURGAT MARINDANY/ Members of the Keek-Onyokie clan have asked for President Uhuru Kenyatta’s intervention as they intensified their demand for the ownership of Ngong veterinary land in Kajiado to be reverted to them On Thursday, a charged meeting attended by clan elders was told that the government was “dragging its feet” on the matter. Led by the elders’ chairman, Stephen Mbaringoi, the elders said Parliament had approved the reversal of the land ownership to the community. The meeting took place at the 1,850-acre land. Mbaringoi said the Lands ministry was delaying the reversal. They said cartels are eyeing the Sh300 million-worth property. There are competing interests in the land from members of the Kaputei clan and another from Kajiado North, the elders said. “There is a likelihood that land cartels will push the clans to fight over the land so that they take advantage and grab it,” Mbaringoi said.  County officials, led by Lands executive Hamilton Parseina, attended the meeting. He said he was aware of the history of the land and appealed to the wrangling clans to be patient as the government looked into their grievances.  “We want to address this issue in a manner that will work for the good of the public,” Parseina said. He denied claims that he was favouring the Keek-Onyokie clan, of which he is a member. “I am here as a county official. Everyone, including the Kaputiei clan and others laying claim to this land are welcome to talk to us on the way forward,” Parseina said.
