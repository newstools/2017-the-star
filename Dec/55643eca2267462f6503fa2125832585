Siaya residents might wait until February before they have a new county cabinet in place. This is following a standoff between Governor Cornel Rasanga and the county assembly. In October, MCAs rejected Rasanga’s cabinet nominees, saying they were not fit to head the dockets for which they were proposed. The assembly also said the list did not have youths or people living with disabilities. On Monday, Rasanga told journalists that he had submitted a “restructured” list of nominees for vetting. But assembly speaker George Okode said they will not vet the nominees until the governor submits accompanying information about them.  “The list cannot be considered to have been submitted until the required information is provided,” Okode said. The MCAs are on recess until February. Okode said MCAs will decide whether they can go ahead with the vetting.
