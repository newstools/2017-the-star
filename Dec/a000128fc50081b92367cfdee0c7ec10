Flora Mutegoa, mother of the late bongo star Steven Kanumba, has spoken out after actress Elizabeth Lulu was convicted this year. Lulu has been jailed for two years for taking part in the actor's death without intending. Kanumba's mother told Millard Ayo: 'Ni hukumu ya kesi ya Lulu. Kwa sababu imechukua mda mrefu miaka mitano sasa hatimaye haki imetendeka kweli kwangu sitasahau.' She says a documentary on the life of Kanumba will soon be released. "Sasa hivi tunaandaa documentary yake ya historia ya Steven Kanumba." Last weekend, Nigerian actor Ramsey Nouh visited Kanumba's grave, where he described him as a great man. "Kanumba left a mark and a growth of the film industry, and I'm sure you have a lot of things to say about him. I met him once in my life and it was cut short. He was a great man and a great personality to behold and unfortunately, here we are crying over his grave. It's really sad. I don't know who to blame for his demise, but we will just leave it to God."
