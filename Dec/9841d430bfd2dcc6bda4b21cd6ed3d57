Kikuyu singer Ben Githae was among those many Kenyans didn't think should have been awarded top State honours. Speaking to Word Is, Ben said his affiliation to Jubilee is his democratic
right. "Well
tangu nilipokua sijajulikana nilikua naona hizo awards zikipatiwa akina
Esther Wahome, Eric Wainanina na Kamaru. Mara yangu ya kwanza niliingia
kwa ofisi ya Kamaru nilipata hiyo picha ya award imewekwa kwa ukuta and
when I asked mzee hii nayo inaitwa nini he told me its an award that he
was given by former Kenyan President Daniel Arap Moi for his
contribution to the country and at that time, no one complained. "So
my contribution in this artiste world has been recognized by the
President. What I would like to tell them is that favor is very unfair.
Me kwanza ni msanii wa Gospel sana ata kuliko vile nilifanya hiyo ya
'Tano Tena'. "Kuna kitu in gospel, unaeza ona

but favour isipokufuata hutapata kitu yeyote but kuna mwingine anaambiwa
anakunywa pombe ako na wasichana but akitoa wimbo watu wanakua kwa
foleni wakinunua ngoma yake. "It is called
unmerited grace yani ukipata kibali kwa king ata mwingine akuje afanye
somersault but God akisema Ni Ben Githae amepata favor that is how it
will be. "I got it because I deserve it before the eyes of God, but some people may feel I do not deserve it, it's before their own eyes." Â
