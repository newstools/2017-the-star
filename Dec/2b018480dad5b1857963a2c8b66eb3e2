The year 2017 was generally a bad one for Kenya as the political climate, economic conditions, employment prospects, cost of living and security incredibly deteriorated, a new survey shows. The survey by research firm TIFA shows that 75 per cent of Kenyans feel that 2017 was worse than 2016. Only a paltry 12 per cent said this year was better than the previous year, while 10 per cent said 2017 and 2016 were the same. But in what may lift the lid on the economic hardship Kenyans have endured, the poll shows that 81 per cent say that the cost of living escalated in 2017. With only two days to the New Year, the poll is perhaps the clearest signal of the fatigue that characterised 2017 and many Kenyans could be looking forward to better tidings in 2018.

The prolonged election period coupled with drought impacted negatively on the economy and this resulted to high inflation and reduced employment prospects,” TIFA Research CEO Maggie Ireri said. The end year poll, was conducted between 12-16 December. A total of 1,005 respondents were sampled. It has a margin of error of +/-3 and 95 per cent confidence level. Top on the list of the main challenges that faced Kenyans is the cost of living at 64 per cent, political tension at 52 per cent and unemployment at 25 per cent . The record 100 days doctors strike comes fourth at 17 per cent. But according to the poll, the economic difficulty and reduced employment prospects was felt across the country. In Northeastern for instance, 100 per cent of the respondents said the cost of living escalated in 2017 compared to 2016. Ninety-two per cent and 90 per cent of Nyanza and Coast residents, respectively, said the cost of living escalated. Eighty-nine per cent of those living in Nairobi and 83 per cent of those in Central also said 2017 was worse than 2016. However, the Rift Valley had the least of those saying the cost of living had skyrocketed at 60 per cent. In May, Kenya was hit by acute food shortage and the number of those in need of emergency food aid doubled to almost five million. The opposition capitalised on the food crisis to mount a massive campaign against Jubilee, forcing the government to introduce a 2kg maize flour subsidy at Sh90.

At the time, the cost of maize flour, Kenya's staple food had risen sharply by more than 200 per cent. “2017 was the year when food prices became the yardstick for Kenya’s economic performance in the eyes of the ordinary mwananchi,” Ireri said. The end year poll indicates that 71 per cent of Kenyans felt that employment prospects worsened in this year. Nyanza had the highest mentions for employment prospects worsening at 90 per cent, followed by Eastern at 82 per cent. However, in the Rift Valley, only 47 per cent of respondents said 2017 was worse in terms of employment prospects. The sentiments on employment prospects are an indication of the reality as the Kenyan job market experienced a major shakeup. There were massive layoffs in various sectors including the media, banking and even government institutions such as Kenya Airways. With two tightly fought general elections in one year, 81 per cent of Kenyans say the political climate is worse than last year. The poll findings also show that 62 per cent of Kenyans felt that internal security worsened in 2017. The worst sentiments pertaining security was from Nyanza at 85 per cent, followed by Nairobi at 80 per cent. Nyanza and Nairobi were the epicentre of anti-IEBC demonstrations that led to bloody clashes between protesters and the police.

These could be contributing to the negative sentiments on internal security,” the poll states. However, nearly half of the respondents in the Rift Valley had a contrary view with 48 per cent, saying their security was better in 2017 than in 2016. Click here for the latest political news
