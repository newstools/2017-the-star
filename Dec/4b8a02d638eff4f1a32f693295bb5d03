Knut has warned that transferring head teachers of schools that excelled in the just released KCSE exams will affect the stability of the institutions. West Pokot branch secretary Martin Sembeleo said the union will defend teachers who are transferred without valid reasons. He warned politicians against interfering with teachers' affairs saying such actions will not help develop the secondary schools. "Let us keep politics out of our schools. Those who interfere with the education sector risk being sued," Sembeleo said. "Kenya National Union of Teachers will protect its members from any interference in the management of schools." Sembelo revealed that politicians instigated the transfer of several head teachers who were moved to new schools. The Knut boss urged the political leaders to work with all education stakeholders toward improving education standards in the region. "We value the politicians as major stakeholders in education matters but they should follow the laid down procedures if they have any issue with school heads." The official spoke at his home in Lityei village during celebrations for his two children Laban Chumba, who got an A minus in KCSE and Nancy Cheruto of Moi Girls Eldoret who scored a B plus of 71 points.   Read: Maranda principal Boaz Owino transferred as TSC effects major reshuffle Click here for the latest political news
