I was a kenyan affair as Cosmas Kmuitai and compatriot, Pamela Rotichs swept the titles at the Standard Chartered Marathon yesterday. Kimutai was the fastest man over the 42.195km course with a time of 2:22:48, finishing ahead of compatriots Justus Kimutai (2:23:07) and Paul Matheka (2:23:25). Rotich was took the women’s after clocking 2:38:31. Last year’s champion Rebecca Chesir had to settle for second (2:38:48) while Peninah Arusei was third (2:39:07). A total of 12,500 runners took part in the full marathon with 23 elite runners, of which 15 were past champions, forming the leading pack. Both the men’s and women’s champions received $50,000 each in prize money. The fastest times for the Singapore Marathon are held by Kenyans - Luke Kibet (2:11:25 in 2009) for the men’s and Salina Kosgei (2:31:55 in 2006) for the women’s. Meanwhile, Norway’s Sondre Nordstad Moen won the 2017 Fukuoka Marathon in a European record time of 2:05:48 yesterday. “I was confident that I could run 2:07, and on a good day perhaps even 2:06, but I did not expect 2:05,” said Moen,who set a Norwegian half marathon record of 59:48 in Valencia in October. “Today the weather was good and the pacers did a very good job. I had lots of energy in the closing stages of the race.” Moen’s performance is the second-fastest time in Fukuoka, just 30 seconds shy of Tsegaye Kebede’s course record. The 26-year-old also became the first European winner of the Fukuoka Marathon since 2005. With the pre-determined pace of 3:00/km kept well by the pace makers, the race of attrition reduced the lead pack to five runners – Moen, Stephen Kiprotich, Suguru Osako, Bedan Karoki and Amanuel Mesel – by 30 kilometres (1:30:08), at which point the pace makers left the race. As planned, Karoki then made his move, but to his surprise, Moen went with him. Osako – who was contesting just the second marathon of his career – was making a valiant attempt to stay close to the leaders and was followed by Kiprotich and Mesel. Unable to keep up with 2:55/km pace for much longer, Mesel fell away between 30 and 31 kilometres. Karoki and Moen ran in front for the next few kilometres, followed by Osako and Kiprotich. Moen then made his move at 36 kilometres, leaving Karoki in his wake. Within the space of a mile, Moen had opened up a 12-second gap over the world half marathon silver medallist and the gap kept on increasing all the way to the finish, eventually winning in 2:05:48. “I knew that the European record was about 25 seconds faster than three-minutes-per-kilometre pace,” said Moen. “Between 36 and 37 kilometres, I felt some side-stiches and so did not feel very confident, so I tried to keep an even pace. At 40 kilometres (which he reached in 1:59:23), I felt confident that I could break it. “The marathon is the race against yourself,” he added. “One must control intensity.  Karoki hit the wall in the closing stages and was passed by Uganda’s 2012 Olympic and 2013 world champion Kiprotich and Osako. Kiprotich took second place in 2:07:10, the second-fastest marathon of his career, while Osako was third with 2:07:19, moving him to fifth on the Japanese all-time list. “I gave my all to this race,” said Osako after breaking his PB by three minutes. “The first and second place guys are better runners today, but I now know my training is correct. If I continue to train this way, I can continue to improve. I felt that I found a coach I can really trust. In Japan I did not find anyone like that.” Portugal’s Antonio Pinto set a European record of 2:06:36 in 2000 and it was tied three years later by Benoit Zwierzchiewski of France. Turkey’s Kaan Kigen Ozbilen clocked 2:06:10 last year, but Moen’s time eclipses all of those marks. “I ran 2:05 today,” said Moen, “but I am not sure if people back in Norway realise how good a 2:05 marathon is.”
