Two children in Kilifi were burnt beyong recognition after their makuti thatched mud house was razed down by fire. The incident occurred on Tuesday night when the children was asleep. Khamis Chengo, an elder brother to the deceased Moses Chengo, 9 and Babalo Chengo, 4 said the two were fast asleep when the house caught fire. “I was sleeping in my house when I had my sisters who were sleeping outside calling out my name aloud. I dashed out to find the house where my brothers were sleeping was on fire. We tried to put off the fire but they had already died. We removed them from the rubbles at around 11pm,” said Khamis. Kilifi police boss Alexander Makau confirmed the incident and said police are still probing the cause of the fire. It is reported that the mother of the kids had gone out to drink palm wine when the fire started. Kitsao Tsofa, an uncle to the deceased claimed that a lantern that had been lit in the house could be the cause of the fire. “They slept early and later Moses woke up and took supper before going back to bed. Moments later the fire broke out. We suspect that the lantern fall and lit the mattress they were sleeping on. We do not suspect any foul play because it was the only house that caught fire,” said Kitsao Kitsao further said the Kilifi fire brigade team arrived at the scene after an hour despite the fire station being barely a kilometre from the scene. The two are the last and second last born in a family of eight siblings. Their bodies were taken to the Kilifi county hospital mortuary.
