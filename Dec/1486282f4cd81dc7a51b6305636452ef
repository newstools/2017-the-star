Homa Bay Woman Representative Gladys Wanga has urged area politicians to unite and work together for development. She said elected leaders should fulfil the promises they made to residents during the campaign period ahead of the August 8 General Election. Wanga said Homa Bay is still lagging behind in development. “Let’s put the election matters behind us and work together for the sake of development,” she said. Wanga spoke on Wednesday in Kanyamwa Kosewe ward, Ndhiwa constituency. She urged residents to attend public participation forums so their views can be incorporated in the development agenda. “Leaders would have an easy time in prioritising projects if you give your views at public forums,” she said.
