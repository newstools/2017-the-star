The Parliamentary Committee on Roads and Infrastructure will summon transport stakeholders when the House resumes on February 13 in an attempt to end road carnage. Vice chairman Moses Kuria on Sunday said the team will summon the NTSA, Kenha and Kerra officials. He spoke during a service at Kingdom Seekers Fellowship Church, Nakuru. Kuria was with Nakuru Senator Susan Kihika and Njoro MP Charity Chepkwony. “We will do all it takes to have a dual carriageway developed,” he said. “I have lost a number of friends along the route [Salgaa] and as a member of the committee I will strive to end the menace. I promise the blood spillage experienced will come to an end.” Kihika urged the Church to pray for an end to the road accidents. At least 178 people have been killed in road accidents since the beginning of December. Last week 37 people were killed in a 10-car pile-up on the Sachang’wan-Salgaa stretch after a trailer overturned. Kihika said although a number of accidents are attributed to human error, the state of the roads is also to blame as well. She urged passengers to speak out when their driver is speeding or is drunk. Last Tuesday, Roads PS John Mosonik said the government will spend Sh500 million to make the Nakuru-Eldoret Highway a dual carriageway. Construction will begin in January or February and will take six months. The authorities have started erecting bumps and marking the highway between Kibunja and Ngata in Nakuru county as a temporary solution to the carnage. The contractor has deployed four teams to Sobea in Salgaa, Sachang’wan, Mukinyai and Kibunja. Residents have urged the Transport ministry to speed up construction of the dual carriageway.
