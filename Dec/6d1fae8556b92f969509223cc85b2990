Governor James Ongwae yesterday told the High Court that he was fairly elected with a big margin. He said that IEBC conducted the August 8 polls in a fair and transparent manner. Ongwae said a few transpositional errors of results in forms 37A and 37B will not change the final outcome. He urged the court to dismiss the petition against his victory. The petition was filed by voter Joel Makori. On Tuesday, Justice Hellen Omondi dismissed one of the two petitions filed by Lumumba Nyaberi. She said it was defective. Ongwae said the margin between him and Chris Obure, who came second, cannot be disputed. He is serving his second term, having won with 206,164 votes. Obure had  100,760 votes. Ongwae’s lawyer Okong’o Omogeni, said the petitioner, who was JP’s chief agent, accepted the results by signing form 37A.
