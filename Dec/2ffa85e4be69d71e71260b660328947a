An assistant chief in Kitisiru, Marsabit has been remanded for allegedly defiling his 13-year-old
daughter. Emmanuel Lengolei, alleged to have defiled the minor twice in March, was charged at Moyale
Magistrates court on Thursday and denied bond. Moyale senior
magistrate Kimani Mburu was told that father committed the incest in March 26
and 28, this year. The minor was taken to Gertrude's Children's Hospital where she was
examined. Mburu denied
the suspect bond on grounds he may interfere with further investigations into
the case. The case
will be heard in January 3, 2018.
