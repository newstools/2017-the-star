The National Cohesion and Integrated Commission has arrested a 17-year-old Embu boy. Erick Munyi has been charged with posting a hateful message on Facebook. Police officers attached to the NCIC tracked Munyi, alias Sudui, in Embu town before he was charged yesterday before chief magistrate Maxwell Gicheru. Munyi allegedly committed the offence on November 9. His statement is said to have threatened to cause ethnic hatred. He wrote, “Luo and other 46 counties are not to stay together as Kenyans, because of bad things Luo has done. So the good thing is to build a boundary between Kenya and Luo, so that Kenya stays with love and peace #jubili.” The charge sheet indicates the NCIC understood the words were calculated to stir ethnic hatred against the Luo and other communities. Munyi was not allowed to take plea. Instead Gicheru ordered an assessment of his age be conducted at the Embu Level 5 Teaching and Referral Hospital. However, he told the magistrate he is 17 years old. Munyi told Gicheru he dropped out of school. The magistrate ordered that he be produced in court again to take plea. In July, the NCIC warned the public against spreading hate on social media as the August 8 general election approached. Commissioner Joseph Nasongo said the agency is monitoring WhatsApp, Facebook and Twitter platforms to rein in hate mongers. He cited propaganda for war, incitement to violence and hate speech as some of the issues on their radar.
