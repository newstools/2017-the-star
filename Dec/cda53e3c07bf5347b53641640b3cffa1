Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho has denied allegations by former Senator Hassan Omar that he colluded with the electoral agency to be declared the winner. Omar filed a petition against Joho asking the court to nullify his election, adding Joho’s election was unfair. Joho (pictured) said the IEBC is a free and independent institution which carried out its mandate without interference or orders from anyone. “The IEBC did a wonderful job in the Mombasa elections, especially for the governor seat,” he said. Joho testified before judge Lydia Achode and said he was declared the winner and issued a certificate after beating his rivals, including Omar, by a large margin. He said he was present during the declaration at the Bandari College tallying centre, but he could not remember whether he signed the declaration forms. “I cannot remember whether I am the one who signed the declaration form or my chief agent did,” he said.
