One of Kenya’s leading female DJs has been banned from ever stepping into Nairobi’s hot entertainment joints after she physically assaulted a female reveller who talked to her hotshot boyfriend. The female deckmaster has been rising up in the entertainment ranks to secure a spot as a talented DJ, but her temper and violent outbursts seem to be her biggest downfall. This is sad, especially because the hot, sassy DJ has gained as much prominence in the entertainment arena as the voluptuous Pierra Makena. As we speak, the female DJ has been blacklisted by other corporates by the simple virtue of attacking and injuring a corporate bigwig who dabbles in events management. The incident went down on Friday night at a popular, high-end club in Kilimani.  What happened was, the DJ watched with anger as the marketing manager walked up to her boyfriend and started catching up with him. She lunged at the marketing boss and started raining blows on her without any provocation whatsover. It is not clear why the sassy turntablist turned ballistic over the marketing executive’s banter with her boyfriend.  After the unwarranted attack, the marketing boss’s colleagues and the club security intervened and rescued her from the vicous jaws of the DJ. The DJ was then quickly carried out of the club by the security and was not allowed back… A source has confirmed the DJ has serious insecurity issues and has in the recent past been involved in altercations, with her previous male friends not to mention ladies who she sees as a threat!!!
