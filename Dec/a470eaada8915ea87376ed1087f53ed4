Nyashinski has come out to rubbish rumours that he asked for money to appear at a local Friday night show. “It’s not true. Going for interviews helps my brand and my music. I can’t shoot myself on the leg, it doesn’t make sense, someone was given the wrong information. I’ve never asked for even a shilling. I’ve never asked for money to do interviews, those are just stories.” He said he will shut down rumours around his relationship when he gets married, saying it won’t be a secret anymore. “Kuna rumours that I’m dating and that I have a baby mama, but when I get married, I’ll post it for everyone to see, I won’t keep it a secret.” And why had he committed social media suicide? “Sikutoka Instagram, nilikua nataka nislow down frequency yangu ya kupost. Ni kitu tu ya marketing, saa ingine I have too much fun nasahau hata kupost.” The MTV nominee of the Best African Act then thanked fans for their support in voting for him. “First of all, Kenyans coming together to vote for me was so much love, I can’t express it, I’ve never seen something like that, I was happy. I was really happy, that was a really good thing for me in my life, thank you so much guys.” In his new song, Hayawani, Nyash has pointed out a couple of things, among them poverty and violence. “The inspiration is how people are becoming inhuman in the society. We’ve reached a point where there is so much greed, as long as you and your family are ok. I thought I had to say something about that.” He added: “I think there was a time where we were doing it ourselves but we’ve started learning, we’ve shown we can’t do it as one person. For example, Sauti Sol, they have a manager, director, production manager, stylist and all those things combined to make a brand that can stand with other international brands. Now that we are working with teams, we are learning and moving. For sometime, we were importing more than we were exporting, but now we are exporting.”
