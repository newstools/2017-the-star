Ninety-eight adolescents and young people are infected with HIV-Aids every day, an NGO has said. The Aids Healthcare Foundation in Kenya wants new ways introduced to curb the spread. “It is on this background that AHF will be rolling out an HIV prevention program targeting adolescent and youth next year,’’ AHF director Wamae Maranga said. She was speaking on Sunday during the celebration of World Aids Day at the University of Nairobi. Maranga said HIV-Aids spread has increased among adolescents, despite recording a decrease among other age groups. The National Aids Control Council has also raised concerns on the increase in new HIV/Aids infections among adolescents. Maranga said adolescents and young people contributed to 46 per cent of all new HIV infections.
