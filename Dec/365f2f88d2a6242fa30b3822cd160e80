Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga and Alego Usonga MP Samuel Atandi have dared the police to make true their threat and arrest Raila Odinga on Tuesday. The two said the police will have to arrest “the more than 10 million Raila supporters” before reaching him. “I am waiting to see how the paltry 2,000 police officers will arrest 10 million of Raila’s supporters that will attended the inauguration then finally arrest Raila,” Atandi said. Addressing mourners at Ngura in Siaya during the funeral of Caroline Oduor who was allegedly shot by police in Baba Dogo, Rasanga said Canaan is real. NASA said Raila will be sworn in as the people’s President tomorrow. Envoys and religious leaders had urged Raila to cancel the event.
