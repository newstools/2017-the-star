It is back to school time across Kenya in a few days. The
Ministry of Education did well to release the primary and secondary
examinations results early enough, giving parents the time to prepare. There are a number of issues that require urgent attention,
clarity in communication and action.  The transfer of head teachers by both the ministry and the
Teachers’ Service Commission is one such issue. It is a good idea to transfer
teachers from their home counties to other areas. The TSC should listen to the
objections being raised and respond. The issue of set books and their distribution has also
raised concerns. The ministry will supply the books directly to the schools.
This is a positive move, eliminating middlemen and vested interests. But the government is taking too long to release the new
list of textbooks parents should buy. Thirdly, and sadly, there is the issue of school fees. Some schools
continue to defy the government guidelines. This is unacceptable and CS Fred Matiang’i should sort it
out before the schools re-open.
