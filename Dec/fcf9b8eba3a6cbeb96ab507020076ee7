The battle for Kenya’s nine slots at the East African Legislative Assembly has intensified as 25 Jubilee and NASA nominees woo MPs ahead of Thursday’s crucial vote.  The candidates have been busy selling their agenda to the lawmakers. The lobbying is expected to go a notch higher tomorrow when Parliament holds its second last sitting before breaking for a long recess on Thursday.  President Uhuru Kenyatta (Jubilee) and Raila Odinga (NASA), through their coalitions, have fronted 14 and 11 nominees.  The Arusha-based EALA’s third Assembly concluded its sittings on June 4. The fourth Assembly is expected to begin sittings early next year.  Election of Kenya’s representatives could not be concluded as scheduled during the 11th Parliament.  The Joint Parliamentary Select Committee on EALA has pushed the 12th Parliament to speed up the process.  “The Assembly cannot be inaugurated without representation from any of the partner states, Kenya should not hold the Assembly,” committee co-chair Katoo ole Metito said. Top on Jubilee’s nomination list is former Kamukunji MP Simon Mbugua while Raila Odinga’s brother Oburu Oginga tops the NASA list. “I have delivered before when I was an MP. The race is competitive, but I am confident of being picked,” Mbugua told the Star yesterday. Former Vice President Kalonzo Musyoka’s son, Kennedy, is also in the running. Former MPs Abdikadir Aden (Balambala), Fatuma Ibrahim (Wajir), Wanjiku Muhia (Nyandarua), Mpuru Aburi (Tigania East), Abdilaziz Ali Farah (Mandera East) and Mohammed Noor (Mandera North) are also in the list of nominees.  Ex-Clerk of the National Assembly Justin Bundi is also eyeing a slot.
