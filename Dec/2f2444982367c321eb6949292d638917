  Wrangling leaders of the AIPCA have begun talks to heal the sharp divisions that have rocked the church. Chairman Paul Ngichu and secretary general Stanley Mwangi Monday convened a meeting in Murang'a where talks on reconciliation began.  The divisions led to the consecration of both Fredrick Wang'ombe and Julius Njoroge as archbishops. The consecrations followed the retirement of Archbishop Amos Kabuthu who rose to the position in 2013 in a ceremony witnessed by former President Mwai Kibaki. Kabuthu stepped down in January, following a High Court court order to hand over the mantle to Wang’ombe. Church members however conducted elections on January 9 during which Njoroge was elected archbishop in a process that was widely criticised. President Uhuru Kenyatta is among leaders who tried, in vain, to end the wrangles. Deputy President William Ruto attended the ordination of Njoroge as the archbishop in
a ceremony held at the Kasarani Stadium in March. National leaders of the African Independent Pentecostal Church of Africa, who met in Kenol, said they want to end wrangles and unite the church. They said infighting has hampered the
operations of the church. Ngichu blamed failure to adhere to the church's constitution for the divisions. “I believe it is now time for all church leaders to come together and help us move forward in unity,” Ngichu said. He said all ordinations of bishops have been stopped until a
meeting of all diocese leaders is help. The meeting will held tomorrow, at the church’s headquarters in Bahati, Nairobi. He said many bishops had been ordained illegally, and that the meeting is
expected to come up with proper structures for consecration. “We have invited 6 leaders from every diocese who are expected to attend the meeting,” Ngichu said. The meeting will also seek to unite the church under the leadership of
one archbishop.= “We are asking all our followers to remain calm as we work towards solving
all our issues,” Ngichu said.
