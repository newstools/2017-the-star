Motorists will pay more for petrol from midnight following an upward review of pump prices by the ERC. In the review that takes effect until January 14, super petrol will go up by Sh1.47 to retail at Sh103.14 per litre in Nairobi. Diesel and kerosene have increased by Sh0.03 and Sh0.19 respectively. Diesel will now retail at Sh88.74 per litre, while kerosene will go at Sh66.37 per litre in Nairobi. The ERC attributed the changes to the average landed cost of imported super petrol, which it said increased by 4.21 per cent from Sh63,144 per ton in October to Sh65,804 in the month of November. Landed weighted cost for imported diesel and kerosene went up by Sh 0.55 per cent from Sh55,920 to Sh56,227 and 3.58 per cent from Sh57,877 to Sh59,952 per ton in the month of November respectively. "The free on board price of Murban crude oil lifted in November was posted at US$63.65 (Sh6,583) per barrel, an increase of 9.55 per cent from US$58.10 (6009) per barrel in October," ERC said in a statement.  The new pump prices in Mombasa are Sh99.86 for super petrol, Sh85.47 for diesel and Sh63.61 for Kerosene. In Kisumu, diesel has been caped at Sh105.11, diesel at Sh90.92 and kerosene at Sh68.3.  In last month's review, super petrol went up by Sh3.37 per litre to retail at Sh101.67, while diesel and kerosene increased by Sh1.85 and Sh1.82 to retail at Sh88.71 and kerosene at Sh66.18 respectively.
