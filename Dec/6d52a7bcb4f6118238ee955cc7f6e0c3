More than 100 Environment ministers from across the world have confirmed they will be taking part in the third United Nations Environment Assembly. Environment CS Judi Wakhungu yesterday told the Star on the phone that Kenya is ready to host the assembly. “We are expecting four heads of state,” she said. Set to be held at UN Environment’s headquarters in Nairobi, the assembly will be themed “Towards a Pollution Free Planet”.  Wakhungu said Kenya is the only developing country hosting the United Nations Environment Programme and the United Nations Human Settlements Programme. She said plastics ban will be a major discussion. The CS banned the production and use of certain plastic bags through a notice dated February 27. Wakhungu said the ministers will discuss the status, trends and actions needed to be taken to address pollution in all its forms. The CS said Kenya does not have proposals to table during the assembly. The assembly will come up with resolutions and a global call to action to address the critical environmental challenges facing the world today. The UNEA forum will be attended by astronauts from NASA and the Indian Space Agency, heads of state and environment ministers. Others set to attend are leading scientists, CEOs of multinational companies, NGOs, environmental activists and celebrities to discuss and make global commitments to environmental protection. The CS is expected to brief the media before the event starts on Monday. On December 3, hundreds of international and local cyclists will descend upon Nairobi’s Central Business District taking over the streets with their bikes in a race to #BeatPollution. The race is a leisurely bike ride that involves high-level participants and hundreds of Kenyan residents to show how the world is ready for more sustainable transportation methods and share-the-road initiatives. The ride will be flagged off by Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko.
