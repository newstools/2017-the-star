Two Ugandan lawmakers were
dragged away and detained when they tried to enter parliament on
Wednesday, as a divisive debate on extending President Yoweri
Museveni's rule was marred by violence for a second day. Police blocked some legislators from entering the building,
and live television footage showed two of them being driven away
in security vehicles. Both oppose the bill that would remove an age cap of 75
years on presidential candidates, thereby allowing Museveni to
extend his 31-year rule of the oil-rich East African nation. It was unclear why the lawmakers were detained, and police
did not immediately respond to calls seeking comment. The legislators blocked by police were attempting to enter
parliament to serve court documents on House speaker Rebecca
Kadaga, who was presiding over the debate. The document called on her to appear in court at 2:00 PM in
respect of "the irregular suspension of our members of
parliament," independent lawmaker Wilfred Niwagaba told a local
television station minutes before he was detained. Six MPs -- all opposed to removal of the age cap - were
suspended from parliamentary proceedings on Monday for alleged
disorderly conduct and refusing to heed the speaker's
instructions. A debate on the bill was adjourned for several hours on
Tuesday after some legislators said soldiers had entered
parliament. Uganda's next presidential election is scheduled for 2021. Click here for the latest political news
