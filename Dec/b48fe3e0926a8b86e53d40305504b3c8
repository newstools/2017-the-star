NTSA officers on Friday night arrested more than ten drivers who were found drunk along Eldoret-Kapsabet road. Mohammed Hassim from NTSA said most of the drivers were also found to have overloaded matatus. Hassim said such drivers are among those contributing to increased accidents on the roads.

This is unacceptable,” Hassim said. He said those arrested would be detained until Tuesday when they would be taken to court. “We have now deployed many teams on the roads to crack down on those disobeying the law but we urge drivers and Kenyans to stop this carelessness that is killing many people on the roads,” he said. The NTSA also impounded several unroadworthy vehicles during the crackdown. Passengers were ordered out of the vehicles to seek alternative means of transport after the drivers were arrested. Meanwhile, CEO of the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital Dr Wilson Aruasa has said that the hospitals in Rift Valley are now overburdened by a high number of accident victims. Dr Aruasa said the orthopaedic and trauma units along with several other wards are now full off people injured in accidents especially along the highways. “As a hospital, we receive a very high number of accident victims and this is a worrying trend which we have to deal with urgently”, said Dr Aruasa who was speaking at the hospital on Saturday.
