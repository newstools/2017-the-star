Nyeri county should first start with Rural Health Training facilities in three subcounties before upgrading them to Kenya Medical Training College campuses, an official has said. KMTC chief executive Peter Tum (pictured) said the rural facilities will only be transformed to fully fledged campuses if equipment is available. He said Nyeri requires expansion as the demand for medical courses in the country is growing daily. “This year we had more than 35,000 applications for various programmes in KMTCs,” Tum said on Friday. KMTC has 67 campuses countrywide. The number increased from 42 to 67 in five years. But Tum said as KMTC grows, it has to ensure it has the right people to teach, the right equipment and adequate teaching facilities. He said KMTC is partnering with the county government to provide infrastructure. Earlier, Nyeri Governor Mutahi Kahiga said there were plans to start KMTCs in Mukurwe-ini, Mweiga and Karatina towns. These colleges already exist in Nyeri and Othaya towns. “We are thinking of ensuring that we expand within Nyeri, because of the population. Nyeri has hospitals that are key in training our students,” Tum said. Other than Nyeri, KMTC is also working with the Kakamega and Mandera county governments to start similar facilities there. He said the government is focusing on KMTCs, as it’s necessary to ensure universal healthcare. There’s a huge gap in resources in the health sector.
