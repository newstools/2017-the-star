About one in 10 medical products circulating in Kenya could either be substandard or falsified, according to new research from the World Health Organisation. WHO made the conclusion after analysing studies on substandard medicines from 88 developing countries, including Kenya. The figure is higher than the three per cent often given by Kenya’s medicines regulator - the Pharmacy and Poisons Board. WHO said the affected countries have agreed to work together to reduce the problem. “Imagine a mother who gives up food or other basic needs to pay for her child’s treatment, unaware that the medicines are substandard or falsified, and then that treatment causes her child to die. This is unacceptable. Countries have agreed on measures at the global level – it is time to translate them into tangible action,” Dr Tedros Adhanom, the WHO director general, said in a statement. The organisation said antimalarials and antibiotics are the most commonly counterfeited drugs across the world. Most of the counterfeits - 42 per cent - have been found in Africa, 21 per cent from the the Americas, and 21 per cent from the European region. The WHO report was released yesterday.
