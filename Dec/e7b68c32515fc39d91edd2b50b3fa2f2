Professional footballers should be screened for exercise-induced asthma, researchers say, after a study found three in 10 could be affected. University of Kent scientists used lung tests to identify players with symptoms and improved their fitness after treatment. Elite athletes are known to be prone to asthma-related problems because of their high-intensity breathing. Experts said screening made sense and could prevent later problems. In the study, presented at a meeting of the British Thoracic Society, 97 footballers in England from two Premier League clubs, one Championship club and a League One club had their lung health tested during pre-season. Twenty-seven players tested positive for airway or breathing problems, also known as exercise-induced asthma. Ten of those had no previous history of asthma or airway problems. When they were treated with appropriate medication, their symptoms - such as tightness of the chest, wheezing and coughing after playing - reduced, and their lung function improved over time. The researchers also found that their aerobic fitness and performance on the pitch improved.
