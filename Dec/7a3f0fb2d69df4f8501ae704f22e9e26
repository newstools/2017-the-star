Laikipia Governor Ndiritu Muriithi on Monday instructed the county treasury to black list six suppliers and contractors who were found have sent bills for phantom projects. An audit of pending bills has uncovered several gaps and lapses in the procurement process of the previous administration. “One glaring lapse is the origination of procurement where in many instances purchase requisitions are missing, suggesting that the procurement process was initiated verbally,” Muriithi said. The governor said the audit has so far reviewed 184 cases, involving Sh273.42 million spanning 2016/17 financial year. These include 71 projects amounting to Sh 239.78 million of development expenditure bills.  Auditors have also reviewed 113 cases of supply of goods and services amounting to Sh33.64m million in the recurrent expenditure bills.  The bills to 12 projects and 40 for supply of goods and services have been approved for payment.  Muriithi said he wants to streamline procurement.
