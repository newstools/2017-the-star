The hearing yesterday of a rape case against former Central Imenti MP Gideon Mwiti could not proceed since his co-accused was not present. Mwiti allegedly raped the woman in his Nairobi office on March 21, 2015. He is charged alongside Dr David Muchiri, who allegedly screened her for HIV against her will. Both denied the charges. Muchiri is currently remanded over the murder of a KRA lawyer. Milimani chief magistrate Francis Andayi ordered Muchiri to appear before the court on December 19. Prosecutor Daniel Karuri applied for Muchiri to be summoned so new hearing dates can be fixed. Earlier, Mwiti applied to have the case terminated. Mwiti, through lawyer Dr John Khaminwa, said the charge sheet is defective. He said that the section under which Mwiti is charged does not disclose a sexual offence. The trial magistrate rejected the application, saying it has not merit. The prosecution had opposed the defence application, and instead asked the court to allow the prosecution to amend the charge before the hearing of the case. Mwiti is facing charges of rape, assault and intimidation. He is accused of raping a woman at Tana Club, Westlands. He denied the charges and was released on Sh100,000 bond. Dr Muchiri alone is charged with aiding and abetting the offence of rape and failing to prevent a felony. Muchiri allegedly conducted an involuntary HIV test on the complainant, whose identity cannot be revealed for legal reasons. According to the Sexual Offences Act, a person found guilty of rape charges faces imprisonment of a term not less than 10 years, which can be escalated to life imprisonment.
