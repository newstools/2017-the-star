Majid Al Futtaim has announced plans to open a fourth Carrefour hypermarket after taking up the anchor tenancy at the Junction Mall on Ngong Road. The new hypermarket will be opened in January 2018 and will initially operate a section of the total selling partial area, offering a selected product range. “We are excited to mark yet another milestone in our ambitious growth and expansion plan. The Junction is a highly strategic location for Carrefour Kenya, and is significant in our ongoing quest to serve a growing urban population yearning for a wide range of high quality products at great value prices, and backed up by excellent customer service," Franck Moreau, the country manager, Majid Al Futtaim said in a statement. “In the short-term, we will start with a select range of the most popular day-to-day products and eventually increase this to a full range of more than 30,000 items, including a wider selection of fresh produce, and an onsite fresh bakery and butchery, when we start full operations later in 2018,” Moreau said. Majid Al Futtaim currently operates over 210 Carrefour stores across 15 markets and continues seeking opportunities to open stores in Kenya and the rest of the greater East African region. The Junction store will boost staff employment count at Carrefour in Kenya to 1100, all within two years of operation in the country, a majority being Kenyan nationals.
