A standard two schoolgirl aged nine from Funyula constituency in Samia subcounty was swept away by the raging waters while bathing in the River Nzoia. She was with her grandmother. Speaking to the Star at the scene on Monday, her parents Gladys Origi and Kennedy Oniego said Imelda Neema was at Busembe Primary School in Samia. She had gone to visit her aunt Angeline Diang’a, a resident of Makhooma village in Budalang’i constituency.  “My daughter had gone to visit her grandmother during the holiday. The two went to bathe in the River Nzoia (pictured), but, unfortunately, the young girl slipped and fell into the waters,” her mother said. The distraught parents are appealing to well-wishers, among them Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong, to help them retrieve the body.  They do not have the necessary equipment. Bunyala police boss Fredrick Kaggai joined the family in search of the missing body. He confirmed the incident and appealed to residents living along the River Nzoia to be on high alert. Kaggai urged the residents to report to him at once should they spot the body of the missing girl. On May 20, three children of Eldoret MCA aspirant James Ratemo Nyambane were found murdered and their bodies dumped in the River Nzoia five days after they went missing. Clifford (seven), Glen (three) and Taya (five) were reported missing. They did not return home after leaving for Eldovil SDA Church. Taya was a standard one pupil of Shalom Academy while Clifton attended Highlands Academy. Their father was vying for the Kapsoya ward representative seat on a Kanu ticket. He lost.
