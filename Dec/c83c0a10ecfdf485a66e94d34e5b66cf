Ledama Kina's election as Narok senator should be annulled due to irregularities and massive discrepancies in IEBC forms, the High Court in Naivasha heard yesterday.  Petitioner Nkoida Lankas, the former Narok South MP and current Narok speaker, was the first to testify at a petition challenging Kina's election. Kina was the ODM candidate and Lankas Jubilee's. Lankas, through his lawyer Marete Kithinji, produced election forms showing the discrepancies. He told judge Christine Meoli that the differences between the total votes cast and the valid ones was 84,956, with Narok South constituency leading in terms of the discrepancies. “Your honour,
data contained in forms 38A and 38B is totally different from the one in form
38C, and I believe that this cost me my victory,” he said. Lankas was taken to task by the IEBC and the senator’s legal team for failing to file
an affidavit over the tallying. “I had agents in
all the voting and tallying centers and they gave me information that the ballots
were not displayed during the counting exercise,” he told the court. During the court
proceedings, the former legislator expressed his concern over the manner the
current senator registered for elections exercise. He said that the
senator Ole Kina used his national identification card to register for the ODM
nominations but later used his passport while handing over his documents to
IEBC. “I have in my affidavit
expressed this anomaly which caused a major delay during the vetting period
before the elections kicked off,” he told the court. The hearing continues.
