Depositors of the defunct Imperial Bank Limited want Central Bank of Kenya to release their Sh100 billion held since 2015 when it was put under receivership. In a class action suit filed at the High Court in Nairobi against the Central Bank of Kenya and the Kenya Depositors Insurance Corporation (KDIC), the depositors contend that the actions of the CBK and KDIC have violated their right to property as protected under Article 40 of the Constitution and the right to fair administrative action. "As a state organ, the CBK has the obligation to observe, protect, promote and fulfill the rights guaranteed in the constitution. Additionally, the CBK and the KDIC are also bound by the national values and principles of Article 10 which include transparency, accountability and good governance,'' Imperial Bank said through its lawyer, Edward Muriu of MMC Africa Law. Depositors have also blamed the regulator for neglecting its mandate, leading to the collapse of the bank in October 2015. 'Owing to the requirements under the Banking Act and the prudential guidelines, CBK is deemed to have known the activities in the banks even before the collapse. Had the CBK diligently carried out its statutory obligations of vetting bank officials, auditing, and inspection to ensure compliance with the law, the bank could not have collapsed,'' depositors submitted in a suit filed on Sunday.
