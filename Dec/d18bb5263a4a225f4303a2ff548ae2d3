There was bitter fallout between coast regional coordinator Nelson Marwa and former Mombasa police commander Peterson Maelo before the latter’s retirement, it has emerged. Maelo was replaced by Johnston Ipara shortly before the October 26 fresh presidential election. On Saturday Marwa accused Maelo of doing a 'pathetic' job during his tenure. “We have a new police commander. Huyu alifanya kazi, wacha yule maziwa lala tulitoa hapa (this guy really worked unlike his failed predecessor),” Marwa said. Marwa said he could not entertain a failed officer in his administration. “I don’t want ‘maziwa lala kwa serikali’ no matter who you are,” he added. The administrator said further accused Maelo of serving political party interests. He called on everyone to deliver failure to which there will be dire consequences.  He noted that serving residents should be priority and non-performers will be edged out. “Nobody is pushing you to do your work, you signed for it,” he said. The changes in the Police Service that saw Maelo retire came a few days after NASA’s anti-IEBC protests turned violent in different parts of the country including Kisumu.
