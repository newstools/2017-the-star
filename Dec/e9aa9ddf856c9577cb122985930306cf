She said that the children department was reporting at least one case every week terming the trend as worrying.  “The suspect who is in custody has in the past been arrested on similar offences and we hope that this time he will face the law,” she said. Speaking in Gilgil, Sakina noted that a couple of weeks back they had rescued another minor who had been sexually abused and seriously injured by a KDF junior officer.  Gilgil OCPD Sera Koki confirmed the latest incident adding that the suspect would be charged in court once police were through with their investigations.  “The only case of defilement regarding the suspect is the one we have and action will definitely be taken if there is ample evidence,” she said.
