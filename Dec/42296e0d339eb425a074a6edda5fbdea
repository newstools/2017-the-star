A family in Mwingi has demanded justice for their 14-year-old girl who was reportedly defiled by a man released under unclear circumstances. The claim is that the class seven pupil was sexually assaulted by their 40-year-old house help on November 21 at their home in Maiyuni village. The family reported the matter at Mwingi and Nguutani police stations but the suspect was not charged. An assessment at Mwingi Level Four Hospital indicated the girl was not defiled but another from Nairobi Women's Hospital showed the crime took place. "We are unhappy with the circumstances under which the suspect was arrested and mysteriously released," said the girl's mother. She said they suspect officials at Mwingi hospital colluded for the suspect to be freed. The mother said officials at Mwingi Law Courts also told them the suspect had no case to answer as the medical reports conflicted. Click here for latest political news Â
