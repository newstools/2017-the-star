Governor Cornel Rasanga on Monday left the High Court in Siaya in stitches when he insisted on giving more information when asked yes or no questions posed by aspirant Nicholas Gumbo’s lawyer. Rasanga (pictured), who was being cross-examined in the petition challenging his victory, was asked to confirm with a yes or no whether the election was free and fair. Immediately after saying no, Rasanga tried to explain his answer further, but Gumbo’s lawyer interjected, telling him to ‘keep the explanation’. Rasanga, who would not keep silent, told the court “even a slaughtered hen is allowed to make noise, why do you deny me the right of response?” When asked if he agrees with the petitioner that the election was not free and fair, Rasanga said he will never agree with Gumbo inside or outside court. When asked if Gumbo commands a large following, Rasanga agreed, but added they were only after his ‘leso and money’.
