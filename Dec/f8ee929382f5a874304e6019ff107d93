Politicians have agreed to unite to revive the Mumias Sugar Company and encourage farmers to go back to sugarcane farming. Matungu MP Justus Murunga, his Mumias East counterpart Benjamin Washiali and five MCAs said they will put their political differences aside and work together to revive the miller. On Saturday, more than 200 farmers met local leaders and the Mumias Sugar Company management, led by CEO Nashon Aseka. During the event in Matungu constituency, farmers voiced their concerns about the company and sugarcane farming. Sugarcane growing is the main economic activity in most parts of Kakamega county. Murunga, who was elected on the ANC party ticket, invited Washiali of Jubilee to talk to the farmers. “We have discussed with my friend Washiali, Mumias West MP Johnson Naicca, Navakholo’s Emmanuel Wangwe and other MPs from the Mumias zone to help our farmers and the company,” he said. The leaders condemned other millers that have been poaching sugarcane from the Mumias zone. “The issue of people stealing sugarcane should stop, there is an Indian who has been poaching our cane. We ask him to stop immediately,” Murunga said. Washiali said the national government is committed to reviving Mumias Sugar. He also asked the company management to investigate and report any cases of corruption at the miller. Aseka promised to reach out to the farmers, saying he is always ready to listen to them. “I have talked to the managers and told them to prioritise paying farmers,” he said. “We have reduced the farmers’ debt from Sh900 million to Sh600 million.”  The CEO said the company has a debt of Sh23 billion and this can only be offset if the firm resumes full operation. Farmers have complained of being neglected and mistreated by the previous management at the miller.
