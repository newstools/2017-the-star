Two legislators from Homa Bay are pushing for better terms for farmers who will supply sorghum to the Kenya Breweries Ltd plant in Kisumu. The Sh15 billion plant will begin operations next year. President Uhuru Kenyatta launched it in July. The brewer is currently seeking to contract at least 15,000 farmers to grow sorghum. Speaking to the Star yesterday, Karachuonyo MP Adipo Okuome and Ndhiwa’s Martin Owino said they want both the farmers and the firm to develop economically. “The appeal is to have the brewer offer better prices that encourage farmers to grow the crop,” Okuome said. Owino urged the company to cushion farmers against losses by insuring their crop. and providing farm inputs. The two urged the company to avoid too many middlemen as they are likely to interfere with the supply chain. “Some middlemen may turn unscrupulous and exploitative if given the chance. We shouldn’t be involved in issues that would discourage farmers from growing cash crops,” Okuome said.  About 12,000 farmers grow sorghum in West Karachuonyo for subsistence and commercial purposes. The plant will initially produce Senator Keg, made using locally grown sorghum.
