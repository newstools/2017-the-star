An Australian MP has proposed to his partner during a parliamentary debate on legalising same-sex marriage. Tim Wilson's moving proposal to Ryan Bolger, who was sitting in the public gallery, was a reaffirmation.  The pair have been engaged for nine years. The bill to legalise same-sex marriage was introduced into the House of Representatives on Monday, after sailing through the Senate last week. It may be the first proposal during an official sitting, local media said. "In my first speech, I defined our bond by the ring that sits on both of our left hands. They [the rings] are the answer to the question we cannot ask," an emotional Wilson. "So there is only one thing left to do. Ryan Patrick Bolger, will you marry me?" The question drew cheers and applause, before Bolger responded with a resounding "yes" - a reply noted in the parliamentary transcript. The government MP said the protracted national debate on same-sex marriage had been the "soundtrack" to their relationship. Earlier, Wilson spoke about his own experience growing up as a gay teenager and struggling with a stigma surrounding homosexuality. "This bill rams a stake into the heart of that stigma and its legacy," he said. Conservative politicians are expected to suggest amendments to the bill, such as additional exemptions for celebrants who refuse to marry same-sex couples. Â Last month, Australians decisively supported same-sex marriage in a national vote.
