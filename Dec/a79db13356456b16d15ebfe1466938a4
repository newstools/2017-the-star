Mwakio said the two men had extended an electric connection from their house to a stream, 500 metres away in a bid to pump water for domestic use. “A relative thought the teacher and his son were stuck in the mud and rushed to the scene to rescue them and was unfortunately electrocuted,” Mwakio said. He continued: “they connected electricity to the power pump and called someone in the house to switch on the power because the main switch is in the house, and upon switching on, the two men got electrocuted and died.” The OCPD said Kenya Power officers have begun investigations to establish the cause of the electrocution. “We suspect that there were naked electric cables during the connection. We have asked Kenya Power to investigate,” Mwakio said. He said the bodies have been taken to Moi Teaching and Referral hospital for postmortem.
