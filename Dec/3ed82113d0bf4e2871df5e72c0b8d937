Kajiado West MP George Sunkuyia on Friday dismissed claims he was arrested by police for “disturbing” President Uhuru Kenyatta on the phone. There had been claims on social media that he was arrested on Wednesday on arrival from Mombasa. Sunkuyia is said to have called Uhuru during “odd hours” and that the “incessant” President informed a local administrator to warn him against “calling me at night”. It was said Sunkuyia was released on Thursday morning, after he was taken to the Ongata Rongai police station, before being ferried to an unknown destination. But Sunkuyia accused a Kajiado NASA politician, who petitioned his August 8 election, of spreading the lie on social media. “I’m in constant touch with the President and if it’s true he’s offended by my calls, he should have told me verbally — not using the police,” the agitated legislator said. “It’s true I have a petition in court, but I can’t be so naive as to ask for the President’s favours. It’s my case, not a state case.” Ongata Rongai police boss Silas Ringera also dismissed the claims the MP was arrested. He said they did not interrogate Sunkuyia. “I should have known of his arrest had he been brought here. We don’t have his name in our occurrence book,” he said.
