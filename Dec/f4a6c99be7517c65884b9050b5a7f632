A community living near the Konza Techno City have asked the government to allocate them an adjacent idle 32,000-acre piece of land. The locals on Saturday said that the parcel, which was initially allocated for livestock research, has not been in use for over 65 years yet they have remained landless. They said that the research being conducted at the site by the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) does not benefit the community in any way. "The benefits of the purported research had not been experienced by the local residents since 1952," Shadrack Muli, a representative of Makonza Society, said. "We are not even aware of where they sell the milk produced from the dairy cows being reared here." Muli claimed that the cattle found on the piece of land were not for research but are owned by individuals who had leased the land for grazing. He urged the government to revert the land to the community who can them put it into a more productive use. The hundreds of members also took issue with the Kenya Wildlife Service saying that its officers were harassing them on poaching claims. Harrison Ngui, the chairman of another society trading as Konza South, said most of their members have been arrested and charged with poaching. He asked the KWS to relocate the few wildlife animals in the area as that land is not demarcated as a game reserve. "This is not a game reserve and we will not allow the Kenya Wildlife Service to continue harassing our members," Ngui said. "If they donâ€™t relocate the few wildlife animals in here we will actually sue them in Court," he added.
