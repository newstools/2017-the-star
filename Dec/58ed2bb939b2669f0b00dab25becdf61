The government should consider employing professional child psychologists for schools, an NGO has said. Equality Now noted this will help children suffering sexual and gender-based violence by their parents to share their traumatic experiences. The human rights organisation added they will do so in confidence and without fear of consequences. “Professional child psychologists will immediately raise the red flag when they notice a child is always withdrawn. This is because children fear opening up to their teachers as they will stigmatise them,” Africa director Faiza Mohamed said in an interview with The Star on Friday.

They will protect the girls and ensure justice. Safe spaces do not only involve structures but the environment where children are." The recommendations came amid the 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence Campaign and a day after children spoke of harrowing experiences in the hands of their caregivers.  At the child protection forum on Thursday, victims said they were raped continually, mostly by their stepfathers and uncles. Children from nine schools in Nairobi and Busia counties also said their biological mothers did nothing to help them. “When I told my mother what was happening to me, she claimed I was highly sexed and that I wanted to engage in indecents act with my stepfather," a 17-year-old girl told the panel during the forum. As enshrined in the constitution, the government must ensure children are protected and put in place structures for victims of defilement to report the crimes without victimisation.
