Luo CoE chairman Opiyo Otondi has accused a section of elders of attempting to split the community. Otondi said the elders, led by Nyandiko Ongadi , who on Saturday approved of President Uhuru Kenyatta’s reelection, are fighting for their own interests. He said there is no way bona fide members of the Luo CoE could have met and agreed to approve Uhuru’s reelection. Speaking to the Star yesterday, Otondi said elders are waiting for NASA leader Raila Odinga to give the community direction. “As bona fide elders of the Luo community, we’ve not endorsed Uhuru Kenyatta’s presidency. The other group wants to use the commuinty’s name to serve their own interests,” he said. Otondi warned Ongadi and his against disintergrating the community. “Elders have been perceived as those at the forefront of bringing people together. It’s unfortunate Ongadi and his team are out to disintegrate the unity our community,” he said. Otondi said elders support the call for national dialogue. Ongadi said the Luo elders back Uhuru and urged him to include the community when making key appointments.
