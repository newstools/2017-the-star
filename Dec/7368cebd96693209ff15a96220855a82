Football giants AFC Leopards are considering contracting Ghanaian national Isaac Oduro for two years to replace long term leftback absentee Marcus Abwao. The Ghanaian will be assessed in training before being handed a contract at the country’s Caf Confederation Cup representatives. With Abwao set to be sidelined for a length spell after undergoing a knee surgery, the club turned for the services of the former Hearts of Oak player, who parted ways with his immediate employers at the expiry of his contract this year. Leopards, through chairman, Dan Mule, confirmed their interest in the West African should he impress coach Robert Matano in training. “Oduro is with the team already and we will offer him a contract if he impresses in training. The coach proposed we give him a chance to train with us for three or four days and if he is content with his qualities, we shall give him a two-year contract. If we miss on him, we will initiate talks with other leftbacks as Abwao has undergone a surgery and will be out for a long spell. We are also on course in bringing in a Cameroonian forward, who is already in the country,” said Mule. Leopards have captured the signatures of foreigners Henry Uche from Nigeria and Prince Papa from Ghana. The two were handed their debuts against Kakamega Homeboyz during the opening ceremony of the Bukhungu Stadium where they passed Matano’s test.
