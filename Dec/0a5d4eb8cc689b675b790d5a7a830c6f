Thirty-six people have perished in yet another grisly road accident at the notorious Salgaa blackspot on Sunday morning after the bus they were travelling in collided head-on with a trailer. At least 30 died on the spot while six others lost their lives while undergoing treatment at the Nakuru Level Five Hospital and Molo Sub-County Hospital. Preliminary reports said the accident occurred at around 3:30 am after the bus which was travelling from Busia collided with the trailer at Migaa area, some 3 kilometres from the notorious Salgaa on the Nakuru-Eldoret highway. The bus, which was reportedly speeding, was being driven on the wrong lane. The latest accident comes just a day after three bishops died on Friday night on the Embu-Makutano road after their saloon car collided head-on with another vehicle. The accident brings to well over 200 the number of people who have lost their lives in road accidents in the month of December. NTSA is considering converting the 20km stretch between Sachangwan and Salgaa to a dual carriageway to minimize the unending accidents along the stretch.
