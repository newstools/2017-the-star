Unregistered traditional herbalists walking around with jerrycans of a red concoction a panacea for all ailments will soon be rounded up. The Pharmacy and Poisons Board yesterday said most of those who sell the concoction in towns are unregistered. This threatens the lives of the public, it said. “We don’t encourage it. For that product to be out there, there have to be standards,” Coast region boss Paddy Agoro said. “Somebody walking with the product all over means the standard of the product is also being compromised.” He spoke in Mombasa, where the board issued a report on the progress of their crackdown on illegal pharmacies in the Coast region. Since Sunday, 40 quack pharmacists have been arrested and charged and more than 30 chemists closed in Mombasa. “We are warning them. In case they are found, they will be prosecuted,” Agoro said. He also cautioned Kenyans against buying the concoction, but added, however, that they will bring the herbalists on board so the products can be clinically tested before they are approved for sale. “If found fit for consumption, they will be registered,” Agoro said. “We can’t say all herbal products are bad.”
