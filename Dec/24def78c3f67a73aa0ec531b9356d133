Three witnesses have so far testified before the High Court in Eldoret in the petition seeking to nullify election of Marakwet East MP Bowen Kangogo.  Petitioner Sammy Kemboi before Justice George Kimondo, said the IEBC illegally used Ketmongunget Health Centre and Embokala as polling stations yet they were not gazzetted as polling stations. Kemboi also said violence marred the tallying process at Chesoi center, leading to the shooting to death Nancy Kipchumba, 15 by police.  Four other people were injured during. A vehicle belonging to Linah Kilimo was shot at by police. Kangogo however wants the petition dismissed, insisting that the election was free and fair.  He said claims of irregularities by the petitioner were baseless and that the IEBC declared the correct results. The IEBC declared Kangogo the winner with 14,812 while Kilimo who was vying an independent candidate got 13,845.  This was a difference of 966 votes. Hearing of the petition is going and Kangogo is listed as one of the witnesses. IEBC officials will also testify.
