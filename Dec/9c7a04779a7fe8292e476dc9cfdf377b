 The World Bank and the national government will build a permanent dyke in Budalang’i in February, a senior irrigation official has said. Social development officer Dan Adino on Thursday said the dyke is meant to stop perennial flooding, which destroys crops and displaces residents. He was addressing residents affected by the Lower Nzoia Irrigation Project at Mudembi trading centre, Bunyala East. “We are carrying out a 90-day mobilisation to identifying the actual number of people affected by the project ahead of kick-off scheduled for February,” Adino said. China’s Sino Hydro Corporation was awarded the Sh10 billion tender to build the project and rehabilitate River Nzoia dykes. The works are to be completed in three to four years. The project will double the area under irrigation.
