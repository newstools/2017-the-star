A violent teenager was seen laughing and grinning after he was freed on a suspended sentence despite threatening to throw a toddler out of a window. Joshua Ingram left his ex-girlfriend and her child terrified in an attack at her home in Grimsby in May. The town's crown court heard Ingram shoved the boy's head into a wall, put a knife against the mother's face and tried to smother her with a pillow. But despite apparently mocking his victim in messages posted online during the court proceedings, he avoided a jail term and emerged from court laughing with friends. Ingram - who admitted making threats to kill, assaulting the woman and causing criminal damage - could still be locked up after prosecutors announced they are appealing the sentence. The 18-year-old told his victim: "You watch. I'm going to go mad" during the attack. He then smashed up her son's rocking horse and the boy looked on screaming, a previous court hearing was told. Ingram told the woman: "I'm going to throw him down the stairs. I'm going to throw him out of the window... I'm going to kill you both. You're both going to die," prosecutors said. But Ingram appeared unrepentant in messages posted online on the day of a previous court hearing. Apparently mocking his victim, he wrote: "Hahaha what a trampy liarr, still laughinggg like alwaysss [sic]." He later added: "She was a sick in the head freak. I can't believe she's gone and said this but at the end of the day I know the truth and that's all that matters [sic].' Of photos of him laughing outside court, he added: "Was sat in court for hours thinking a was gonna get sent down for something that didn't happened wouldn't anyone be smiling [sic]??" His suspended sentence, seen as "unduly lenient" by the Attorney General, will now come before the Court of Appeal, where three judges will decide whether to jail Ingram. Â
