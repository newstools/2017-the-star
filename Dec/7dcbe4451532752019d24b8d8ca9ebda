Three Chinese firms have collectively invested more than Sh54 billion over the past two years, showing strengthened Kenya-China relations in trade and economy growth. China Wu Yi Company Limited invested Sh10 billion to build the Kenya Construction Industrialization Base that offers industrialisation research, development and production and building materials warehouses which, from next year, will have annual capacity to produce 50,000 cubic meters of structural components to meet the ever-increasing demand for new buildings for Kenyan people. A Chinese private enterprise, Twyford Ceramic Company, launched last year in Kajiado county which, within the last one year, has become the largest building ceramics factory in Eastern Africa and has localised its raw materials supply and now has hired 1,500 local employees. “In one year it has become the largest building ceramics factory in Eastern Africa, now it produces 30,000 square metres of floor tiles every day,” Economic and Commercial Counselor Guo Ce said. He added that the second production line will be put into operation next January, which will double the production capacity. “The company plans to invest $70 million (Sh7.21 billion) in its expansion plans and has so far invested Sh3.09 billion ($31 million),” he said. The Chinese manufacturing giant AVIC international has also made an investment worth more than Sh41.18 billion ($400 million) in the construction of the Global Trade Centre, which will be a landmark building in Nairobi after completion. “China has become the largest trading partners, the largest creditors and main source of contractors. It has created 42,468 jobs for Kenyans by the end of last year and we hope to open more doors for China in trade and economy development,” KenInvest managing director Moses Ikiara said.
