Only 70,073 candidates have attained university entry mean grade of C+, with 142 candidates getting As. Last year, 88,929 attained university entry grades, while 141 got As. Speaking when he released KCSE results on Wednesday, Education CS Fred Matiang'i said there has been a decline in candidates who got A-.  Only 2,714 candidates got A-, compared to 4,645 A- in 2016. But he noted that female candidates have performed better. "In six subjects female candidates performed way better than the men and also the bulk of schools that have done well are girls schools," he said. Matiang'i mentioned three schools that have done well: Alliance Girls, Kenya High and Pangani Girls. "Pangani Girls is the most improved this year," Matiangi said, noting that the top three candidates are from Pangani, Moi High School Eldoret and Alliance High School. Candidates should send their index numbers to the number 22252 to get their scores. Earlier, TSC boss Nancy Macharia said 40 teachers involved in KCSE exam irregularities and must be punished. "If they are found capable, we will deregister them and make sure they don't set foot on public or private schools," she said.
