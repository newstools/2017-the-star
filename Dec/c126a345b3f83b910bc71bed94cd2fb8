Meru County Assembly’s Implementation Committee wants the contractor to finalise renovations at the Kinoru Stadium in the next six months. During an inspection tour of the stadium on Monda, committee chairman, Elijah Kirimi (Kibirichia Ward MCA) and his deputy Ruth Kananu urged the contractor to ensure the project is delivered within the stipulated time.  Kirimi said they are satisfied with the pace at which the facility is progressing.  “Some sections are almost complete such as the changing rooms, terraces and the laying of the pitch. We are very happy with the progress,” Kirimi said.  The initiative was started 2014, under former Meru Governor Peter Munya’s administration at a cost of Sh200 million. However, the facility has been taken over by the national government for completion at a tune of Sh892 million.  The venue played host to Kenya Premier League matches involving former champions Tusker FC. The chairman assured that the facility was on course despite Kenya being stripped off the right to host the 2018 African Nations Championship. Kenya was stripped off the rights to host Chan in September after the venues for the extravaganza failed to meet the required international standard threshold.  Meru governor Kiraitu Murungi and Sports, Arts and Culture Principal Secretary Kirimi Kaberia earlier this year signed an MoU allowing the national government take over the project from the county government.
