A man yesterday denied killing a nurse early this month at a medical facility in Nairobi. Joseph Mungai denied killing Faustine Mwadime on December 6 at the Chiromo Lane Medical Centre in Parklands. This was after the prosecution told the court that Mungai was fit to stand trial. The report produced in court shows Mungai had gone to the hospital for alcohol detoxification and mental issues. Mungai had earlier been remanded by the court so he could undergo a mental examination to enable police to complete their investigations. His medical report had to be produced in court before he could take a plea. Mungai, a licensed gun holder, is accused of shooting the nurse who was attending to him when he went to the facility. Reports show that Mungai insisted on keeping his gun after refusing to surrender it to the hospitalâ€™s security personnel. Mwadime died on the spot after he was shot in the head. The case will be mentioned on January 15 for directions on bail application.
