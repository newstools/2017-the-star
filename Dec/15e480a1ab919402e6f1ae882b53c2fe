Embu leaders have differed on the list of presidential awards given out on Jamhuri Day. Embu Chambers of Commerce and Industry boss Samuel Kanyi and Knut executive secretary Josphat Kathumi criticised the committee that came up with the list of those honoured with Head of State Commendations. They said some beneficiaries not deserve it. But Embu Senator Njeru Ndwiga, Mbeere North MP Muriuki Njagagua and Eastern region commissioner Wycliffe Owallo supported the committee that developed the list. Ndwiga yesterday told the Star on the phone that a lot of work goes into the selection and proper vetting is done. “If the whole country is left to decide, nobody can get one because criticism will be everywhere. It’s good for the President and the committee in charge of the honours to be left alone to do their work and decide who should be given the medal,” he said. Njagagua said recipients deserved the awards.
