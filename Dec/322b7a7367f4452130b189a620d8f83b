Kajiado governor Joseph Ole Lenku has fired  Olkejuado water and sewerage company CEO Joshua Tapataiya for failing to stop supply of salty water. "Hotels in Kajiado cannot give free water to customers after meals. Residents cannot wash their clothes without risking discolouration," Lenku said in a statement. Most of the water running in Kajiado taps is salty with traders forced to buy water for drinking from merchants who operate boreholes in the county. The governor said the firm had failed to address the scarcity of the commodity adding that he needed a new and fresh team to tackle the problem. Water CEC Florence Waiganjo said the company failed to furnish the county government with a strategy on how they would change the situation for the better. "They did say how they will effectively supply clean water to residents thus provoking the governor to take action against them." "The governor has given a lot of water promises to the county. He feels the team at Olkejuado water firm is not up to the task,"  Waiganjo said. Lenku's action came hot on the heels of his declaration last week that he would not allow water from Loitokitok to bypass county residents on its way to neighbouring counties.
