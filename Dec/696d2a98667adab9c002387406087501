A High court in Kitale has ordered for the scrutiny and recount of votes cast in 16 polling stations in Sirisia constituency. Judge Anthony Mrima, in the petition challenging MP John Waluke's re-election,  directed Kitale deputy registrar Dorcus Wangeci to oversee the recount ahead of the January 16 mention. The case was filed by Ford Kenya’s Levy Makali on grounds of electoral malpractices he argues affected the results declared after the August 8 polls. Makali, through his lawyer Simiyu Makokha, accuses Waluke of instigating violence in various polling stations on election day, a situation he said saw many stay away from the vote. The recount follows allegations that Waluke was issued two certificates bearing different dates and ID numbers. "This means that the first certificate was prepared and issued before the announcement and declaration of the winner," the petitioner said. Justice Mrima also said the recount will reveal whether there was a problem with the tally following a blackout experienced when the votes were being counted at various polling stations. The judge dismissed an application by Makali that the petition be transferred to Bungoma High court. Waluke was declared the winner with a total of 18,077 votes against Makali's 9,669. The court also banned the use of mobile phones during the scrutiny. "Let parties warn their agents against sending information of the ongoing process to the public," the judge said.   Click here for the latest political news
