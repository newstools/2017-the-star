We will share whatever information required to unearth improprieties in Murang'a," Kiru Mwangi said at Integrity Centre. Mwangi said they had gone to Kinyanjui's office to ask about the budget for KICOSA games in Machakos and the members' medical cover procured from Britam.  He said the assembly wanted to establish the amount allocated for the games as well as for the insurance.  The MCA said the scheme is suspicious because the clerk has declined to show documents specifying terms and payments made for the same. "One of us fell ill and was admitted to Nairobi Hospital where he incurred a bill of more than Sh1 million but the company only paid Sh300,000," Mwangi said. "We wanted to find out because the Salaries and Remuneration Commission has recommended inpatient medical cover of Sh3 million for an MCA."   He denied claims that they stormed the clerk's office adding that they had gone there officially to exercise the duty of oversight and audit.  "We were surprised to see armed police officers with teargas storm the office to eject us. There was a disagreement but no one stormed any other's office," the lawmaker said. The lot accused the Kinyanjui of being disrespectful to them adding that the official has ignored their grievances. Click here for the latest political news
