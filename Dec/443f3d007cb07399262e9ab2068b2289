At least 50 orphaned children from Gatundu children's home will have their school fees catered for by the NG-CDF, MP Moses Kuria has said. Kuria said those in form two to form four will benefit from the fund as the government will offer free education for form one students. He spoke on Saturday when he led university students from Gatundu South and North constituencies during a visit to the school. The home has 13 students in high school, 9 girls and 4 boys. The legislature also donated foodstuffs worth Sh 50,000 and a cash donation of Sh 40,000. This year, five students four girls and 1 boy qualified to join various County secondary school. The Home's vice chairman Dominic Marangi while thanking the MP and the university students called on other well-wishers to assist the home to erect a perimeter wall for the school for security purposes. "We would also appreciate if we would get a donor to assist us in starting poultry farm to boost the home's income and to provide the children with eggs, " he said.   Click here for the latest political news
