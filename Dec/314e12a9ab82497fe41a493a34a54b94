US President Donald Trump on Friday restored trade benefits to Gambia and Swaziland under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), the US Trade Representative's Office said.  The AGOA trade program provides sub-Saharan countries duty-free access to the United States on condition they meet certain statutory eligibility requirements, including eliminating barriers to US trade and investment and making progress toward political pluralism.  Gambia lost its eligibility in 2015 due to human rights abuses and the deterioration of the rule of law, USTR said in a statement. It said Gambia had made progress in strengthening the rule of law, improving human rights and supporting political pluralism. Swaziland lost AGOA eligibility in 2015 due to concerns over restrictions on the freedoms of peaceful assembly, association, and expression, USTR said.  It said Swaziland had met a series of benchmarks on political freedom, making it eligible to regain the preferential trade status.  In another facet, Trump said he
will suspend some of Ukraine's benefits under a preferential
trade program in four months unless Kiev improves its protection
of property rights. He said Ukraine's suspension from the Generalized System of
Preferences program "stems from its failure to provide adequate
and effective protection of intellectual property rights despite
years of encouragement and assistance from the US government." GSP provides duty-free treatment for goods from poor and
developing countries. Trump decided to provide 120 days' notice because Ukraine
"has a viable path to remedy the situation, including improving
the current legal regime governing royalty reimbursement to
right holders' organizations," USTR said. The USTR statement and a proclamation signed by Trump did
not indicate what part of the GSP program for Ukraine would be
suspended. Click here for the latest political news
