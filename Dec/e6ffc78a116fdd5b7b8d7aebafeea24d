The High Court in Kisumu yesterday struck out a petition challenging the election of Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malalah. The petition was filed by Seth Panyako against the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission as the first respondent, the Kakamega county returning officer as the second respondent and Malalah as the third. Judge Thripsisa Cherere dismissed the petition on grounds the petitioner failed to comply with requirements of the election petition rule by not filing an affidavit supporting his plea over the poll results declared by the returning officer. Cherere said, “The petitioner has not availed all that is needed in a clear and easily discernible manner, leaving the court and the respondents to employ time in second-guessing what the results, which formed the mainstay of this petition, are”. The judge also said the petition could not stand because the petitioner did not observe election petition rules that stipulate petitioners shall deposit security for the payment of costs not more than 10 days after the presentation of the petition.
