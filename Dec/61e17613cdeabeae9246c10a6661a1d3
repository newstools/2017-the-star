Business community in Bungoma County have said that their businesses have been largely affected by the political stalemate in the country. Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry Bungoma Chapter Chair, Herman Kasili, said that many businesses have seen reduced activity during the period from August 8 to the swearing of President Uhuru Kenyatta last week. Rev Kasili said many businesses were forced to scale down their activities as the stalemate in the country continued to the fresh elections. “We have witnessed reduced activities during the campaign period for about three months and this was as a result of politics. We are glad that the politics is slowing down and businesses can now pick up,” he said. Kasili said there were no direct investments to the county from foreign investors who were wary of the political state. He said that many investments are usually pegged on the political stability of a country and any issues usually scared away potential investors. “We know that political stability creates an enabling environment for investors. With the stalemate that we witnessed in the country it was hard for even counties to have direct foreign investment and we are glad that this is slowly changing and we will see an increase in investments,” he said. Kasili said that the country needed to move forward and have a proper development agenda instead of focusing on politics all the time. He said President Kenyatta should now extend an olive branch to the opposition and have constructive dialogue on how best to move the country forward. He said the two leaders need not to put the country on a political path through out but should also seek ways of improving the livelihoods of the people. “We want President Kenyatta now that he is sworn in to unite the country. He should have a talk with the opposition leader Raila Odinga and ensure that we have peace and develop the country to uplift the lives of the people,” he said.
