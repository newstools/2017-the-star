Nairobi Hockey Association has nominated six individuals to vie for positions in the Kenya Hockey Union elections slated for January 13 in Nairobi. They include Inderjit Matharu for presidency, Doreen Otieno (first deputy president), Tom Olal (secretary), Wangechi Gachuhi (treasurer), James Akweri (match secretary) and Kalpesh Solanki (public relations). Apart from Solanki, the other five will be seeking for fresh mandate. NHA believes the candidates they’ve presented are capable of restoring Kenya’s glory of the 1980s and propel the country to attain a permanent status at the world stage. Olal, the executive director of NHA said: “Our nominations is a blend of youthfulness and professionalism which will help steer Kenyan hockey back to the world arena.”  He added that the NHA leadership is looking forward to other branches to nominate candidates for positions in the national federation too to achieve inclusivity in the sport’s administration. The NHA candidates envision to strengthen domestic programs and events, develop permanent calendar for league and tournaments to end on time. They have also promised to make hockey attractive at all levels — minors, juniors, schools, colleges, universities, clubs, masters and expatriates. In addition they have vowed to embrace transparency and accountability, financial stability, partnerships, and (financial) allocation to counties and clubs for the development of the sport at the lowest levels. Successful local events and competitions, player development, training of teams and officials in line with the FIH Hockey Revolution is also part of the sextet’s long time goals.
