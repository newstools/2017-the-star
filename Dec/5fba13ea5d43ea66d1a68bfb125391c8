Fourteen Kisii chief officers signed the EACC Code of Conduct and were ordered to get down to work and deliver services. Kisii Governor James Ongwae demanded services and total dedication in his reorganised administration. The ceremony was presided over by Ongwae and Deputy Governor Joash Maangi. “You have been given an onerous responsibility as authorised officers and accounting officers for your departments. All I need from you is effective service delivery. You must deliver on our development priorities. I will not entertain excuses,” Ongwae warned. He asked officers who have been acting as chief officers to hand over to the new officials immediately. A circular detailing duties and responsibilities for the new officers will be released. “Even if you’re not loyal to me as governor, at least be loyal to the county and the people of Kisii who have given you a job. As you come, I expect you to take care of the government resources and your first task will be to scrutinise pending payments to ensure we don’t pay for ghost projects,” he said. Maangi urged the officers to adopt virtues of competence, hard work and be loyal.
