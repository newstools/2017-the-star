Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Victor Wanyama returned to training for the Premier League club on Monday as he recovers from a knee injury sustained at the start of the campaign. The 26-year-old Kenyan international, who missed just two league games last season, featured in the north London club’s first two matches before picking up the injury ahead of the home match against Burnley in August. “Victor Wanyama joined part of training today as he continues his rehab,” Tottenham said on their official Twitter account, along with a picture of the player in action. Eric Dier, Moussa Sissoko, Harry Winks and Mousa Dembele have deputised in Wanyama’s absence with the former also being utilised in defence following Toby Alderweireld’s hamstring injury last month. Tottenham beat Stoke City 5-1 last weekend to remain sixth in the league and host 13th-placed Brighton and Hove Albion at Wembley on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Crystal Palace defender Mamadou Sakho has sustained a muscle tear in his calf and is set for a lengthy spell on the sidelines, the Premier League club’s manager Roy Hodgson has said. Sakho, who returned from a serious knee injury in September, has captained Palace in their last four league games and suffered his latest setback in last Saturday’s 2-2 draw with Bournemouth. “He’ll be out a long time, how long a time?, I don’t know, they won’t put a time on it, but it’s a serious muscle tear in his calf so I don’t know, but it’s weeks not days, I couldn’t say if it was months,” Hodgson told reporters. “We’ll miss him, in this period he’s played a decisive role, been captain, shown his qualities and when you lose a player like that you can’t be anything other than disappointed and sad.” Fellow defender Joel Ward has also sustained a calf injury and will miss bottom-placed Palace’s game against Watford later on Tuesday.
