Nominated Senator Getrude Inimah (pictured), representing people with disability, has faulted the national and county governments for neglecting her constituents. Speaking in  Kanduyi  on Friday, she asked the governments to explain why they mistreat her people. Inimah said people living with disability are not well represented in the national or county governments as stipulated in the 2010 Constitution. Disabled people are supposed to be given 30 per cent of procurement or employment opportunities, but this has not been realised. ‘’Instead of PLWDs getting their 30 per cent share in government, they were being mistreated by only being awarded three  per cent,’’ Inimah said. She said out of the 47 counties, only 17 have employed people with disability. Inimah said the problem should urgently be resolved. “We don’t want to be a burden to the government and other institutions, so let them increase procurement and employment to PLWD.”
