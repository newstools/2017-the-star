Minority leader John Mbadi was on Thursday ejected from Parliament for failing to withdraw a remark he made that Kenya has no president. Speaker Justin Muturi ordered Mbadi to withdraw the remarks, but the Suba South MP remained adamant. "There is no president in this country to make appointments. I would rather withdraw from the chambers than withdraw the remark," he said. Muturi then ordered Mbadi out of the chambers, saying he "will not allow politics to come at play in the House". "I will not allow that under my watch," he added. Mbadi stood on a point of order to oppose a motion by Majority leader Aden Duale to approve a procedural change on how the Speaker should communicate in case President Uhuru Kenyatta submits cabinet nominees to Parliament.   Story updated Click here for the latest political news
