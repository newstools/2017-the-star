A group of female intercessors from different churches in Nakuru held prayers at Sachangwan black spot following a series of fatal accidents in the area. Led by Rohda Chepchirchir, they said the Holy Spirit revealed to them the accidents on Nakuru-Eldoret highway are caused by the devil and can only be stopped by prayers. "Our intercessory group was told by the spirit to visit the black spot for divine prayers," she said. The group started five years ago and have been praying over contentious issues among them an end to NASA protests. "We have been praying for the nation and God has been speaking to us directly through visions," she said  They warned motorists against drunk driving saying "the devil have been enticing them to do so so as to cause accidents." Chepchichir said the interdenominational group needs support from government to visit where spirit sends them. "The government should not only support the big names but should consider our welfare because God at times sends us to places we cannot afford to pay fare."Â   They poured salt, water and anointing oil along the black spot saying the series of accidents will come to an end.
