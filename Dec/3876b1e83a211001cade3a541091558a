World and Olympic steeplechase champion Conseslus Kipruto will drop the barriers in favour of the boards on February 25 when he competes at the Müller Indoor Grand Prix Glasgow, the sixth and final stop on the 2018 IAAF World Indoor Tour. In what will be just the third indoor race of his career, the 23-year-old Kenyan will contest the 3000m flat at the Emirates Arena in a bid to improve on the indoor PB of 7:55.76 he set at the same venue in 2016. Given his steeplechase PB of 8:00.12, Kipruto should be capable of also rewriting his outright 3000m flat PB of 7:44.09, set outdoors when he was 17 years old. He will take on USA’s Olympic 5000m silver medallist Paul Chelimo and Olympic sixth-place finisher Andrew Butchart of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. “Having competed at the 2016 Grand Prix in Glasgow, I know that the noise made by the fans inside the arena is incredible,” said Butchart. “With the field I will be up against, they play such an important role for me, and I’m determined to kick off my 2018 with a bang on home soil.” Meanwhile, Irolán Echevarría, a decorated coach in Cuba and the region, died after a long disease on last week on his 74th birthday. Echevarría ran the 110m hurdles for Cuba at the 1962 and 1966 Central American and Caribbean Games. He took a coaches course in the former Soviet Union and co-led the men’s and women’s 4x100m relay teams with his friend and former sprint hurdler Lazaro Betancourt to two historic silver medals at the 1968 Olympic Games in Mexico City. Four years later, he coached the women’s 4x100m relay squad and his wife Silvia Chivas to bronze medals at the Olympic Games in Munich. He also led Andres Simon to the 1989 60m world indoor title in Budapest. “On behalf of the NACAC and APA, we would like to extend our condolences to the Cuban athletics family on the passing of our friend Irolán Echevarría,” said NACAC and APA President Víctor López. “More than a friend and colleague, he was like a brother. We shared lots of experiences on sprint coaching and celebrated his athletes’ successes together,” he added. Echevarría also coached in México. Health problems forced him to retire from coaching in 2005. He is survived by his wife and three children.
