Swearing-in Raila Odinga and Kalonzo Musyoka as President and Deputy President will plunge the country into anarchy, former IG David Kimaiyo has said. Kimaiyo on Monday called on Raila to recognise Uhuru as the duly elected President and seek legal redress if he feels aggrieved. He said the swearing that was to take place at an undisclosed location in Mombasa on Tuesday but indefinitely postponed on Sunday, should be completely called off to allow the country to heal after the prolonged election period. “In Kenya, the President is sworn after he is declared winner by the IEBC. Any other swearing-in will lead to anarchy. Leaders should respect the constitution,” Kimaiyo said. The former police boss told the opposition chief to show a good example to Kenyans by respecting the Constitution by resisting attempts to be sworn-in and seek to engage in dialogue with Uhuru. “It is good if the two leaders engage in a round-table dialogue so that the country moves forward after the elections,” he said. “But meaningful dialogue can take place when people stop talking about treasonable actions such as a swearing-in of a president not declared winner by the IEBC,” he added. Kimaiyo said calls to have Raila sworn-in will divide the country along tribal lines, adding that there was need for dialogue to unite Kenyans. “It is my advice to the opposition to have trust in our courts. They should seek redress if they feel there are injustices meted against them,” Kimaiyo said. He urged President Uhuru to initiate development projects that will reduce youth unemployment, saying idle youth is a threat to security and that such youths are misused by politicians for selfish political interests. “The electoral campaign period has ended and I appeal to all Kenyans to coexist and focus on developing the economy,” Kimaiyo said.
