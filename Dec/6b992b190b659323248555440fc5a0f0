An International NGO from the United Arab Emirates has launched a programme to sponsor weddings for young poor locals in Malindi, Kilifi county.  The programme entails facilitating dowry, buying household items and giving capital to the young couples.  The NGO organises a mass wedding for the beneficiaries.  It is believed by helping the youth to marry it will be difficult for them to engage in radicalisation and drug abuse.  Those behind the idea, a first in East Africa, include UAE AID, Sharjah Charity International and Kenya Humanitarian and Charity.  On Saturday, 20 couples took part in a colourful mass wedding at the Tahdeeb Muslim academy in Malindi town.  Ahmed Aboud, the chairman of Malindi Tawfiq Muslim Youth, said they took time to select the couples out of a list of 36 who applied to get funding for their wedding.  The couples were given beds, household utensils and capital to start a business.
