At least two people died yesterday at dawn and several others were injured when a 4am fire razed the Dream City nightclub and lodging in Kondele, Kisumu. Three rescuers, including two firemen, were injured. The cause of the fire was not immediately established. Firefighters and residents rescued people who were trapped inside. By 9am, they were still battling the flames. Residents had said more people might still be inside but by 4pm, offcials said the debris had been cleared and there were no more casualties. Boda boda rider Cedrick Otieno, who operates near the club, said he had ferried customers and when he returned he saw the fire. Two people were outside the building putting on clothes, he said. Called police, firefighters He alerted his colleagues, but the fire was huge and they were unable to enter the building to rescue people. “I called the police and firefighters immediately, because from the ground we could see a woman screaming. She was in one of the burning rooms and when the firefighters came, we decided to go up to first floor to help them fight the fire,” Otieno said. He said two other people in one of the rooms were screaming for help. The injured were taken to Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital. A waiter at a club next to the burnt club told the Star people were celebrating a birthday in one of the rooms. Since there was no light, they were using candles. “I think they might have passed out and since the floor is made of wood, a burning candle might have caused the fire,” she said. County communication officer Aloice Ager said the proprietor told them there were nine guests in the lodging. When the fire broke out, the night guard woke people, he said. Ager said they could not confirm how many people might have left the building at that time.
