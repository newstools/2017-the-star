Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko yesterday defended his working relationship with his deputy Polycarp Igathe. He dismissed the Star report that he had been relegated to a bystander in the running of city affairs by intervention from the Office of the President. “I’m in very good books with my deputy Polycarp Igathe. The national government owes us over Sh80 billion and already they’ve started releasing this money to us in bits,” Sonko posted on his Facebook page. Instead, he hit back at Star writers, accusing them of blackmail for “refusing to prequalify (your) proxy companies to do supplies in Nairobi county corruptly.” The Star has written to Sonko to substantiate his claims.

State House was also reported to have had a hand in the appointment of the county executives as part of its strategy to control the county, which accounts for around 60 per cent of Kenya’s GDP.
