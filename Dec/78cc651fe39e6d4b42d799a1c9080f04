The Kenya Dairy Board will open a Sh110 million
national referral laboratory for milk testing next year. According to Philip Cherono, technical services manager, tender
for the construction of the laboratory has already been issued, and only approvals
from the Nairobi County are standing in the way. He said the industry has posted impressive growth in milk
collection over the years, moving from 10 per cent to 31 per cent in only a
decade. This translates to some 700 million litres of milk delivered every
year. Milk consumption has also increased in the country with 110
litres per person per year consumed every year. This is the highest in the East
Africa region. “Dairy co-operatives are very critical in sustaining the
dairy industry. More than two million Kenyans derive their livelihoods from the dairy industry,” he said during the launch of the Brookside Dairy Fresh kids’
range of milk products. The milk processor has entered into a strategic collaboration
with Disney to provide a range of milk products targeting children. The new range, dubbed Fun-tastic goodness,  is using cartoon characters such as Mickey and
Minnie Mouse, Sofia the first, Frozen, Lightning McQueen and Spiderman to sell the new kids’ brands. The milk products will be sold in 150 and 250 millilitres,
in vanilla and strawberry flavours, white milk as well as flavoured milk. Marketing director of Brookside Oliver Mary said the new
range of products is targeted to bring in a further 20 per cent market share,
to add to the present 30 per cent share so far for their products. Cherono said although the drought experienced this year
dealt a huge blow to farmers, milk production is picking up after the seasonal
rains experienced across the country.
