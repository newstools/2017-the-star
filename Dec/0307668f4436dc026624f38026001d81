Kenya Commercial Bank rugby tactician Curtis Olago is among the top coaches nominated the category ahead of the 2017 Safaricom Sports Personality of the Year Awards. The 36-year-old guided KCB to three major titles this season including their fifth Kenya Cup victory and their sixth Enterprise Cup title. KCB also won their fifth Impala Floodlit title, beating Impala Saracens 18-17 in the final last month. Olago will be up against national Under-19 cricket team coach Jimmy Kamande, Jos Openda (Telkom, hockey), Edward Manoah (Vihiga United) and Kevin Wambua (Lioness, rugby). Kamande was behind team’s qualification to the 2018 U-19 World Cup. To qualify for the global show, Kamande led Kenyan juniors to victories against Ghana, Botswana and Uganda. Through his guidance Kenya’s dream to return to world stage after 16 years became a reality. Manoah, on the other hand, steered the National Super League (NSL) side to the Kenyan Premier League on their second attempt. They won the nail-bitting NSL competition on the final day amassing 80 points from 36 matches and the feat guaranteed them a promotion to the KPL for their first time in history. Despite financial difficulties that saw them surrender their run away lead after the county government stall their support for the team, Manoah steadied the ship and ensured they made a dramatic comeback. Openda has ensured Telkom hockey team maintain their top spot locally and internationally. He led Orange to their ninth Africa title and is on the verge of capturing the 20th women’s league trophy. Kenya Lionesses coach Kevin Wambua is also in the mix. Wambua guided Lionesses to book a slot for next year’s Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast Australia. He also steered Kenya Lionesses to second place in Africa Cup Sevens after losing 17-12 to South Africa.
