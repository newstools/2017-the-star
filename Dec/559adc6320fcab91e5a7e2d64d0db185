Maua residents want Ipoa to investigate increasing police shootings of innocent people and want the officers transferred. This follows the death of a 25-year-old miraa driver, who was shot dead by Traffic police in Maua town, Igembe South constituency, at the weekend. Dennis Mwenda was shot dead under unclear circumstances. He was the driver of a Toyota Land Cruiser belonging to miraa businessman Mwilo Araja, who ferries miraa to Northeastern. Igembe South MP John Paul Mwirigi yesterday accused the Maua town officers of extorting residents and demanding handouts. “The police were demanding Sh5,000 from the driver, but he said he could only offer Sh2,000,” he said. Residents said they have suffered. Two months ago, Elias Kobia from Katheru was shot as he went to sell miraa. He later died at the Maua Methodist Church. On May 23 last year, 14-year-old Christine Ntinyari from Gacurua village was allegedly shot by police. Igembe South police boss Jane Nyakeruma dismissed claims police were involved. She said Ntinyari was shot by robbers. In August last year, police are said to have shot Joseph Kamoo and Lena Kathure at a trading centre. Kathure said she was shown the cartridge of the bullet used and was told she would get it to help in her follow-up of the case. Doctors later said they had misplaced it, she said.
