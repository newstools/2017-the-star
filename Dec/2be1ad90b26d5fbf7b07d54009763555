Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua plans to use modern technology to build roads. He said the technology Kenya has been using derails projects. It takes too long to tarmac a kilometre, hence increases costs, he said. “We take forever to complete projects mainly due to poor planning, logistics and laxity,” Mutua said when he launched the tarmacking of the new 20km Kivandini-Masinga road. The road is being built by applying bitumen and tarmac on a one-kilometre stretch in a record 10 minutes, instead of the average one-hour. Mutua said the process is an example of how his MCC party intends to prove that it is possible to speed up development through efficiency. The road will link Mutwamwaki, Kalundu, Musingini, Mikimari, Masinga and Kivuthi markets to Masinga town.
