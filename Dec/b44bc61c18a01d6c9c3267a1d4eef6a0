Rejuvenation of the Luhya community and its longed path to State House will be outlined in a summit in Kakamega next Wednesday. The Obulala Movement, a new Luhya lobby, will meet for several hours at the small Jamindas Hotel to make a declaration on the way forward for the community. Obulala is Luhya word for unity or cohesion. Leaders from Kakamega, Vihiga, Bungoma and Busia counties are expected to attend. Luhya unity has been elusive, much sought-after and talked about but never forged. There have been meetings before that amounted to nothing. The nature of the Obulala Movement and the people behind it were not immediately clear. Obulala chairman Richard Ekhalie said the summit will focus on “the much needed paradigm shift in Luhya leadership.” The event is the beginning of a generational change in Western Kenya leadership, Ekhalie told the Star. “The young Turks will be stepping up to provide progressive, brave and visionary leadership to improve the lives of the community in the succession battle,” he said. The theme is Luhya Renaissance. “It will mark the rediscovery or rejuvenation of the sleeping giant that is the Luhya community — with a view to making it take its rightful place on the main national stage,” Ekhalie said. The meeting is to make the Shieywe Declaration on the community’s socio-economic and political well-being and generational change in leaders. ANC and Ford Kenya leaders in NASA are grumbling over what they call bullying by ODM in the National Assembly leadership. They said they have been sidelined in critical decisions. Lugari MP Ayub Savula, who has been advocating generational change, has said his aim to unite and rally the community behind one of their best choices for President in 2022. He said the region has be shortchanged by ODM.
