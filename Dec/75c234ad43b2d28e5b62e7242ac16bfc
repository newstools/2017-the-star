Give more people from Bomet key positions in the government, Bomet Central MP Ronald Tonui has urged President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP WilliamRuto.  Tonui on Friday said Bomet is one of the key Jubilee zones and should be rewarded through appointment of individuals to head key dockets in the government. “During the duo’s previous term, we were not treated equally as other regions. Weonly had one position of a Principal Secretary, while others had up to four. We wonder how that happened, yet we have always voted for Jubilee with hopes of getting rewards,” he said.  Tonui said Bomet has many professionals who can head top state offices and it would be wrong for Uhuru and Ruto to ignore them. “We have many individuals who are learned, but with no jobs. If we continue looking down on them, we shall be painting a bad picture of Jubilee in the region,” he said.
