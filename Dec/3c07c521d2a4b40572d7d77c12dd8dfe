Vihiga county governor Wilbur Otichilo has confirmed that his first one hundred days in office has been marred with a lot of challenges. Otichilo who was reading his own score card  on why he did not score 100% said he inherited a government that had billions of pending bills, bloated staff, lack of proper government structure  and unfriendly staff among others. He said he was forced to bring in Kenya National Audit Office (KNOA) to carry out audit on the pending bills . Otichilo confirmed that he had received KNOA’s report that he said it was “disturbing.” Otichilo gave himself  a score card of scored 65% on what he promised to do for his people in his first 100 days in office. He said there was no official handing over after he won the election hence forcing himself embark on a discovery journey to find out what was happening in the county. In his 100 days in office he has received over 50 court sermons and court orders from creditors Otichillo pointed out this as one of the factors that made him not score 100%. He said he inherited a county government which had a bloated staff of 4500 instead of the required number by the transition Authority of 1320, and to make it even worse the staff had not been paid their salaries for three months. He pointed out that the staff he found in the county had a lot of affection and affiliation to former governor Moses Akaranga therefore his job in the last 3 moths has not been a walk in the park. Howeever, Otichilo believes after bringing in the Directorate of Personnel from the office of the president to evaluate the staff audit will help him stream line the staff.   Otichillo said he will keep on giving him self score cards after every other 100 days. he added that he has gone through a lot of challeges but he has made progress.
