This year's festive season seems to have been a good one for local celebrities. Akothee celebrated it with her Swiss baby daddy. The ageing baby daddy, who is Oyoo's father (Akothee's lastborn child), spoilt them with gifts on Christmas Day. Akothee showered him with praises, saying most men his age spend Christmas with young girls (or rather slay queens), but being the great man he is, Baba Oyoo chose to be with them over Christmas. Akothee has five children with three different men. Akothee revealed she plans to have her sixth child with her manager Nelly Oaks - who will be baby daddy number four. "While men your age be rolling and changing women like clothes on festive season! Popping champagne and painting tables black to fulfil their lust, you are here making sure our children feel the fatherly warmth, wuon Oyoo Daktari, I will let you have the children anytime of the day, hata huyu nitazaa nikuletee France apate passport ya huko tikiti babake Nelly atanunua," Akothee wrote.
