The future of one of the country’s most recognizable institution clubs, Kenya Commercial bank, hangs in the balance following their heartbreaking failure to return to the Kenyan Premier League for a second season running. The bankers had looked all set for promotion back to the top flight but faltered in their last half a dozen matches to miss out on the coveted berth. Now, inside sources allege that the management may be pondering washing their hands off the club that joined the elite league way back in 1997. “We don’t know what the future holds for KCB as a team and for us as players. Ever since the season (National Super League) ended, we are yet to hear from the management,” said a leading player at the club. “Most teams have resumed pre-season training because the NSL begins in just six weeks. There are also issues that the technical bench need to look at like recruitment of players and other contractual obligations with players who are already here. All that goes to show that the future of this great club is on the line,” the player concluded. It is not the first time the bankers have been dogged by an unpredictable future. Following their relegation in 2015, the management was believed to have considered folding the club up citing the massive resources they injected there yet results were dismal compared to the other sports like rugby. They had a turnaround and took part in the 2016 Nationwide league. It is now another time when fans of the club, who prided in nurturing players capable of regularly featuring for Harambee Stars, will be crossing their fingers hoping that the banks’ management continue to support football.
