A hundred acres of Nairobi National Park and 40 acres of Oloolua Forest will be chopped off for construction of Phase 2A of the standard gauge railway. This is after the National Land Commission put out an intention to acquire land on behalf of the Kenya Railways that will unlock the construction that had stalled for months over court injunctions and land ownership disputes. Apart from the park and forest land that is yet to be degazetted, the NLC wants to acquire more than 1000 parcels of private land in (bordering the Nairobi National Park) to Suswa. “In pursuance of sections 112 and 162 ( 2 ) of the Land Act, 2012, the NLC gives notice that the government intends to acquire the following parcels of land on behalf of Kenya Railways Corporation for the construction of Standard Gauge Railway (Phase 2A) in Kiambu, Kajiado, Nakuru and Narok Counties for public purpose,” Muhammad Swazuri, the NLC chairman, said in a December 22 edition of the Kenya Gazette. “Plans of the affected land may be inspected during office hours at the office of the National Land Commission, Ardhi House, 3rd Floor Room No 305, 1st Ngong Road Nairobi and County Coordinators Offices Kiambu, Kajiado, Nakuru and Narok,” he added. This means owners of the affected parcels have 15 days to inspect and put in their claims for compensation, failing which, the government can take over ownership of the land in public interest without compensation, this is as per last year’s amended land laws.
