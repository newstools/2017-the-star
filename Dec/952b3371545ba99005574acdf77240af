Mumias Sugar Company has started a farmers’ outreach programme to entice them back to cane farming. The company is in dire need of raw materials. It has launched the programme that aims at getting more farmers on board. During a farmer education day on Saturday at Musoli in Ikolomani subcounty the company projected they would get the area to farm 350 hectares of cane, up from the current 100 hectares. More than 50 farmers showed up for the education programme attended by company CEO Nashon Aseka. Brown Makosti, a farmers’ representative, said most of them have a hard time believing the company can pay them on time. “We have been encouraged by the new management and today they have given us assurance that our cane will have a market,” Makosti said. The CEO said the company owes farmers Sh700 million dating more than two years ago for sugarcane delivered. “The company management has promised to pay those they owe money from previous years gradually and promptly pay for fresh delivery,” said Makosti. The farmers have urged the county government to provide extension services like ploughing and providing fertiliser. The company acknowledged it cannot offer all extension services to farmers in their current status. “We will be offering the normal farming services to some extent, but we are encouraging our farmers who can afford the input to meet the service,” Aseka said. The CEO said they will be meeting farmers face-to-face to assure them the company is up and running. Mumias sugar reported a net loss after tax of Sh6.8 billion in the year ended June 30. The company has attributed the loss to the tremendous lack of raw material. Many farmers in Mumias had taken up alternative farming. The sugarcane zone reduced after the incapability of the company to pay farmers on time.
