An NGO, Kanco, has trained Informal Service Providers to identify and refer TB cases to hospitals in Mombasa.

In October, Kanco mapped out ISPs in Mombasa. Some 192 ISPs were found in the worst-hit zones — Likoni, Mvita, Ganjoni, Nyali, Kisauni, Mlaleo, Changamwe and Mikindani. Kanco invited 100 ISPs for training, but only 85 showed up. They were trained on how to identify TB patients and refer them to health facilities.
