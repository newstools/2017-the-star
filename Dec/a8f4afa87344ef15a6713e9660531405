Residents of Rongo town are reeling in shock after a primary school teacher committed suicide after thieves stole her 20 chickens. Farmhands found Ruth Muga, a teacher at Nyarach Primary School in Rongo subcounty, dangling from a rope tied around her neck in her poultry house on Wednesday evening. Workers at her farm said Muga had been stressed after thieves stole 20 layers and only left seven birds behind. “The chickens were stolen on Christmas Eve. She tried to look for them in vain,” a worker said. Her husband, a secondary school teacher, had tried to comfort her and told her to accept the loss and move on as they would buy others. Yesterday, Rongo police boss Jonathan Kisaka said the woman left and told her family to prepare supper before she committed suicide.  “The body was found as workers went to look for her to eat supper,” Kisaka said.
