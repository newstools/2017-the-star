The Pop-Up Art Gallery was held on October 4 at Dusit D2. The gallery offers artists a chance to sell their work at more affordable rates and spurs art-buying to people who may have always thought it was out of their reach.  The monthly event is spearheaded by Google Kenya country manager Charles Murito.  Top artists who displayed their artwork include Mr and Mrs Geraldine Robarts, Adrian Nduma and Teddy Mwae.
