Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu has sent all eight subcounty administrators on compulsory leave. Others also sent on the 45-day leave are Kitui administrator Nathan Vungo and Mwingi's Hesbon Kang'e. The officials served in former governor Julius Malombe's administration. Ngilu has ordered deputy subcounty commissioners to act in the positions until advised otherwise. The County Public Service Board wrote letters to the suspended officers notifying them of restructuring. Ngilu is making changes to the administration, which may lead to some transfers. Â "We must agree we are going to provide leadership that is measurable. Five years from today, I want to show the people the change I have brought them," she told administrators in a past meeting.
