Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago has ordered security officers to round up, identify and remove more than 3,000 street children and beggars from Eldoret. Those with parents will be taken back to their homes. Mandago said on Wednesday many beggars are from a neighbouring country and are being misused by individuals to make money. They will be repatriated, he said. Mandago urged men to be responsible and take care of their children, instead of abandoning them to suffer in the streets. This is not the first time the county chief has ordered a crackdown. Two years ago, he sparked a row when he ordered that street children be rounded up and taken back to their counties. Some children were bundled into a truck and dumped in Busia, prompting an outcry from human rights groups. “When we take away the children from the streets, a section of leaders makes noise and accuses me of mistreating them. If they have their children in the streets, they should take them home,” Mandago said.
