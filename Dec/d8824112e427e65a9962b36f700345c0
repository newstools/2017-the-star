Embu Governor Martin Wambora has said he fairly beat his opponents during the August 8 election. Testifying on Tuesday, during the hearing of a petition challenging his victory, Wambora admitted IEBC officials made some alterations on election forms. "The alterations affected candidates across board. It did not affect the results," Wambora said. He said there were stations where votes were added to candidates, while the ballots were deducted from the same candidates at other polling stations. "Those were minor human errors which did not affect the outcome of the vote. They were not deliberate," Wambora said. Wambora's election has been challenged by former Senator Lenny Kivuti. Kivuti wants a recount and scrutiny of votes. He also wants forms 37As and 37Bs verified. Wambora has opposed the application. Wambora beat Kivuti by 96,760 against 96,775 votes.
