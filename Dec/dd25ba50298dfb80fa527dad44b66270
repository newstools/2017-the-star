Seven people have died and several others injured in an accident involving a hearse and truck at Sultan Hamud on Nairobi-Mombasa highway. Makueni county commissioner Mohammed Maalim said the truck collided with the hearse killing the seven instantly. "Those who sustained injuries have been rushed to various hospitals in the region," he said on Saturday. The county commissioner said police are yet to establish the cause of the accident but cautioned road users against flouting traffic laws. The bodies were taken to Machakos Level Five hospital mortuary. On December 19, the government said it will deregister all driving schools and list them afresh to curb road accidents. This followed the incident where 17 people died in a grisly road accident at the Thika-Garissa highway near Kilimambogo area last Sunday. "We need to know who is qualified. We are giving licences to
murderous [people]. How is it that we don't review their health every
year?" acting Interior CS Fred Matiang'i said.
