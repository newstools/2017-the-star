Kiambu Woman Representative Gathoni wa Muchomba yesterday urged residents to report bars and restaurants that break the Mututho laws. Speaking in Limuru town, she said residents still get drunk every day from morning till evening in the villages. Muchomba said the residents are energetic and are supposed to be working to earn a living.  Instead, society is worried sick about them, asking who will save them from bondage. “We feel bad when we see our energetic men and women being wasted by
alcoholic drinks. Something must be done very urgent. It must be backed
by people,” Muchomba said. A bar owner who didn’t want to be named said some outlets have
24-hour licences, yet they sell cheap alcoholic drinks that go for as little as Sh35. “[The] bars do not qualify for a bar and restaurant licence.
They operate 24 hours in the villages. The problem is what they stock.
It is cheap” he said at Nyambare trading centre, Lari constituency,
yesterday. The operator said Samuel Ndung’u who died away on Monday, was drinking in one of the bars licensed as a 24-hour joint. “When he was drunk and the operator noted all was not well, they pushed him outside,” he said. Alcoholics will be rehabilitated by Mama Care Initiative, set up by Muchomba. “My
initiative will be rolled out in all wards. We shall have counsellors
who will address problems facing the society, including alcoholism," she
said.  "We want the alcoholics to know they have a role to play at their homes and within the society.” Muchomba said many women have suffered for lack of support from their alcoholic husbands. “Our aim is ensuring the society has progressed, achieve responsible families,” she added.
