Murang'a executives will go through an appraisal in six months and non-performers fired, Governor Mwangi wa Iria has said.  This is his last term and he is keen to live behind a good legacy.  “...which means my team has to
perform. We have to hit the ground running and those who drag us behind will be
done away with,” Iria said. He spoke on Wednesday during the swearing-in of three executives.  Iria will every year review the executives' performance and sack underperformers. Many CEC members
countrywide sought court injunctions to stop governors from sacking them, but the courts ruled governors have the authority to
terminate their contracts. “CEC members work at the pleasure of governors and
their contracts should be renewed every day depending on their performance,” Iria added. He has retained seven members of his first county executive
committee and replaced Finance executive George Kamau who ran for
Kiharu MP but lost. Kamau has been replaced with George Waweru, who was in the communications docket. Health executive Susan Magada was replaced with
Health chief officer Joseph Mbai, while Environment executive Thirwam Githirwa
was replaced with environmentalist Cecilia Kibe. “I decided to retain 70 per cent of my committee
because I also received 70 per cent of all registered votes during the elections,” Iria said. Cooperatives executive Edward
Maina has not been vetted, but his name has been forwarded to the
county assembly together with the list of chief officers. The first seven executives were sworn in on August 25. Iria said he had
delayed the swearing-in of the others to give them time to reflect on their
performance. The governor said his county government
will establish seven irrigation projects worth
Sh3.5 billion in five years.
