Mwingi Central MP Gideon Mulyungi has threatened that Wiper will desert NASA if ODM will not end its dictatorship. He said the party will take the decision if the Raila Odinga's party doesn't equally share House committee positions among NASA partners.Â  Mulyungi said he is riled that ODM has reserved all top leadership seats in parliament and in all committees. "With or without the coalition, Wiper will support Kalonzo for the presidency in 2022. We will not care if NASA leader Raila Odinga will support us or not." "Kalonzo has asked for this seat for a long time and we are going to support him whether he vies through the coalition or alone," Mulyungi said. "All Kambas will definitely support the Wiper party leader even those who defected since there will be no option." He spoke at his Kalisasi home when he addressed a group of church leaders for a thanksgiving prayer.  Mulyungi said that he has a premonition that NASA is headed for a major split if action is not taken immediately to end the wrangles.  "Many members are dissatisfied completely," the legislator said. He called upon the Kamba nation to be ready to support Kalonzo in large numbers so that the community can as well clinch the seat.  Click here for the latest political news
