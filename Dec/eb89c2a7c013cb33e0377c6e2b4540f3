President Uhuru Kenyatta yesterday said the government will set aside about Sh140 billion for research at universities. He said, “We will have to create stronger research by allocating this financial year two per cent of our gross domestic gross product to support research in our universities.” Kenya’s GDP last year was $70.53 billion ( Sh7.2 trillion).  That would mean about Sh140 billion would be set aside.
