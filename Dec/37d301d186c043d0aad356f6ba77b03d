Mumias Sugar Company will survive its current troubles, MP Benjamin Washiali has said. Washiali said the company was under a new management that will turn around its fortunes. “We want to tell the farmers and all players that leaders are committed on making the company profitable again. We are on the right path and they should not lose hope,” Washiali said. On Thursday, the company said it had suffered a net loss of Sh6.8 billion in the year ended June 30. "The loss came from the previous management who ignored farmers and cane development to focus on transporters and contractors," Washiali said. "The government has also reconnected electricity to the company. It will be cheaper that a generator," added the Mumias east MP. Nashon Aseka replaced Johnson Errol as Mumias CEO is June to take over the cash-trapped miller's turnaround plan. "The fact that the management has already started paying farmers after a week of cane delivery means there is a lot of hope," Washiali added. Washiali, who is also the Chief Whip in the National Assembly, said President Uhuru Kenyatta will commit more resources to the revival of the miller. "The President is keen on this issue," he said.
