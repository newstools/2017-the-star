London Marathon pacemaker Pauline Njeru’s three-year unninterupted reign as the Safaricom Imenti South 15km queen came to an abrupt end after being dethroned yesterday morning at Nkubu in Meru County. The Embu-based Njeru finished second in 58:01.06 to surrender the title to training partner Miriam Nakter who clocked 57:47:04.  Following the win, Nakter, who is also the Nanjing Marathon winner, pocketed Sh100,000.   “ I’m happy to have won the race. It wasn’t easy as Njeru kept fighting till the end but I was able to hold her off,” added Nakter.  Nakter eclipsed a rich field of elite runners including the Kenya Police’s Nakuru-based, 2006 Melbourne Commonwealth Games 10,000m gold medalist Lucy Kabuu who timed 58:28.03 in fifth place.  The 2011 Africa cross country junior bronze medalist Mary Munanu was eighth in 59:28.03 as the Mombasa International Marathon champion Shelmith Muriuki completed the top ten list in 1:00.02.  Njeru blamed her loss to fatigue after taking part in a road race in Poland two weeks ago and vowed to reclaim her title and improve the Imenti South race course record she holds next year. In the men’s category Stephen Kiprop stopped the timer in 48:12.07 to emerge new South Imenti road race king as the defending champion Isaac Kipkoech was relegated to fifth place in 49:53.06. Rock ‘N’ Roll marathon pacer, Emmanuel Bor from Nandi, settled for second spot in 48:58.09 as Makueni’s Alexander Mutiso completed the last podium finish place in 48:16.02. The senior category races were flagged off at Igoji (Kanyuuruko) by the Meru Sports minister Daniel Kiogora and finished at Nkubu stadium while the junior and fun races took place inside the stadium. The race had six main categories including the 15km senior race for men and women, 6km and 8km cross-country (boys and girls), 4km for boys, girls and veterans, 800m boys and girls and a 2km VIP race.  This is the seventh and penultimate race in the 2017 Safaricom Athletics Series with Kisumu Marathon rounding off this year’s series.
