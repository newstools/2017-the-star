The Council of Governors has said it will remain apolitical in the dialogue initiated to end the political standoff between Jubilee and NASA. Last week, governors formed a 10-member committee to spearhead reconciliation, dialogue and healing of the nation following the disputed presidential election and a highly divisive electioneering period. Speaking to the Star, Migori Governor Okoth Obado (pictured) yesterday said the committee had begun its work. Obado said they are hoping to start seeing positive results soon. “For any sector in the country to develop, there must to political stability and calmness. This is the reason behind governors’ intervention to reconcile the country. Remember the counties are the backbone of development,” Obado said on the phone. Obado dismissed claims that NASA postponed Raila Odinga’s planned swearing-in on Tuesday because of cowardice. He praised the decision, saying it will allow for negotiations. “The narrative that the postponement of Raila’s planned swearing-in was a betrayal to his supporters is hogwash. Consultation and talks are more important to us all,” Obado said. He said the governors are keen on ensuring peaceful coexistence among Kenyans. The reconciliation committee is chaired by CoG chairman and Turkana Governor Josphat Nanok. Members include Kiraitu Murungi (Meru), Kivutha Kibwana (Makueni), Salim Mvurya (Kwale), Wycliffe Oparanya (Kakamega), Jackson Mandago (Uasin Gishu), Charity Ngilu (Kitui), Joyce Laboso (Bomet), Cornel Rasanga (Siaya) and Francis Kimemia (Nyandarua).
