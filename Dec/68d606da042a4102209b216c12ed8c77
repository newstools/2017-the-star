Dominion Farm workers yesterday blocked tractors from ferrying sugarcane to West Kenya Sugar Company to force the company to pay their Sh350 million salary arrears. The 350 workers waved twigs and placards, and barricaded the road leading to the farm. “We will not allow sugarcane to be transported to Western yet our accrued debts have not been settled,” the workers said. Fredrick Oloo asked where the money from the sale of sugarcane and cows is deposited yet management told them all the company's accounts had been closed. The workers received termination letters on November 10 in which the company explained it plans to close due to tough economic times. The workers said they will keep 24-hour vigil as they had received information that some equipment is secretly sneaked out at the night. They asked CEO Calvin Burgess or director Chris Abir to convene a meeting to end the stalemate. “We will not listen to anybody apart from Burgess or Abir,” the workers said. Burgess is said to be away in America, while Abir's phone was switched off. A few weeks ago, former Alego-Usonga MP Sammy Weya and other leaders criticised Dominion for negating an MoU signed by the defunct Siaya County Council on behalf of the local community. Weya said the company had not honoured its social corporate responsibilities as agreed in the deal and had instead frustrated the community. He urged the community around Yala Swamp to form a sacco and take charge of the management of their natural resource. Weya, who has expansive investments along the swamp, was addressing the press in Yala Swamp. He said the local community has expertise to grow rice and undertake numerous commercial agricultural activities. If they take over the management of the swamp, they can improve their lives through outgrower schemes. Weya said Dominion has not been remitting statutory deductions.
