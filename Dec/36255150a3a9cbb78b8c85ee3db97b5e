A section of politicians from Kisii yesterday told NASA chief Raila Odinga to respect the Constitution and stop his planned swearing-in. They said Kenya has a President. They said when the Supreme Court annulled the victory of President Uhuru Kenyatta at the August 8 election, Raila was happy. Nyaribari Chache MP Richard Tong’i, Kiogoro MCA Samuel Apoko and his former Bokimonge counterpart George Bibao said Raila should “tone down his greed for the presidency”. Tong’i said,“I urge Raila Odinga to respect the will of the people.” Apoko said Raila is misleading his supporters, saying the “people’s president” is a call for anarchy. Bibao said Raila should honourably retire from active politics because his time to clinch the presidency is over.
