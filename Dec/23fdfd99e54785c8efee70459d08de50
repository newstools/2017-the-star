Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati has kicked off the first-ever public vetting of would-be beneficiaries of the County Bursary Fund in Bokoli - Webuye West Sub-County and in Kamusinga - Kimilili Sub-County.  Speaking at the two events, Wangamati said that through the open forum, only the most deserving cases would benefit.  "I have intended that as residents, you participate in identifying which of your neighbours' children are most deserving of County bursaries," Wangamati said.  Governor Wangamati has increased the County Bursary Fund from the previous Sh180 million to Sh400 million this financial year.  The increase is as a result of massive reallocations realised out of severe austerity measures that have seen the County save up to Sh100 million per month or an estimated Sh1.2 billion per year.  The increase in allocation will see 1,000 students per ward or 45,000 students across the County each getting Sh10,000 minimum in bursary fund.  Under the kitty, all needy students who will make it to National Schools will be fully sponsored.  "To guard against underhand deals that have seen needy cases miss out in the past, I directed that vetting must be an open affair with members of the public taking part and here today, I have come to follow up," he said.  In the past, application forms were used to determine needy cases. This posed serious challenges including locking out the most deserving cases largely due to lack of transparency. At the end of the vetting process, successful candidates in each sub-location will be issued with serialized forms to fill and submit to the ward bursary committee.   Click here for latest political news
