The High Court will on Thursday rule on whether an election petition challenging Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko’s victory will proceed to full hearing or be struck out. Presiding judge Msagha Mbogholi yesterday heard arguments from Sonko. He urged the court to dismiss the petition and petitioners.  Sonko said the petition is defective and the court ought not to entertain it any longer. His win is being challenged by Japheth Muroko and Zacheus Okoth. His two lawyers Harrison Kinyanjui and Cecil Miler said the petitioner’s failure to include Deputy Governor Polycarp Igathe as a respondent in the petition is fatal to the case. IEBC’s lawyer Nani Mungai supported the bid to have the petition struck out, saying a deputy governor is a critical defendant in a petition. In an affidavit to support the application, Sonko said his election cannot be separated from that of his deputy. “I believe that by omitting my Deputy Governor as a respondent, then this court is being invited by the petitioners to act in vain, and it ought not to do so,” he said. But the petitioners say Igathe is not a necessary party.
