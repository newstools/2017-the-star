Chief Justice David Maraga has asked IG Joseph Boinnet to beef up security to judiciary staff after thugs carjacked Kwale chief magistrate Doreen Mulekyo. The magistrate was attacked by unknown persons at Diani shopping centre on Thursday night. She was not hurt during the ordeal. "I call upon the police to ensure the culprits are arrested. We want to see better security for all our staff, and indeed all Kenyans," Maraga said in a tweet on Friday. "Last night’s carjacking of Mulekyo was a shocking incident to the entire Judiciary. We thank God she wasn't hurt," Maraga added. On October  24, unknown gunmen shot and injured Deputy chief justice Philomena Mwilu's driver.  The suspected thugs opened fire on the DCJ's official car.  Constable Titus Musyoka was shot three times on Ngong Road near Marsabit Plaza at about 5pm. Mwilu was not in the vehicle as the driver had dropped her at her home in Karen and was heading to Kilimani.
