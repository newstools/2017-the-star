Lamu is expecting to host 20,000 Muslim pilgrims from around the world for Maulid Festival from December 12 to 15. Organising secretary Idarus Muhsin said locals from Faza, Kizingitini, Ndau, Tchundwa, Matondoni, Kipungani, Kiwayu and other places of the archipelago will take part. "We shall also be hosting visitors from Tanzania, Comoros Island, Yemen, UAE, UK and others," he said on Monday. Coordinator Sheikh Mohamed Khitamy of the Riyadha Mosque said this year marks the 130th edition. "All are welcome," he added. County commissioner Gilbert Kitiyo said security had been beefed up for the event to run smoothly. "We have added more officers on our roads and at sea to ensure we don't have any reason to worry," he said. He  asked residents to be on the lookout for suspicious activities and keep police informed. The festival is marked annually by a section of Muslims in remembrance of the birth of Prophet Mohamed (S.A.W.) in the holy city of Mecca in 570 AD. It is marked on every third month of the Islamic calendar. The event in Lamu will feature a variety of activities and competitions including the donkey race, Jahazi and Kasa races, dhow races and poetry. Click here for the latest political news
