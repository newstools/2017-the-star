Four Kakamega MCAs say the county is on track to form the People’s Assembly. Led by Mumias Central MCA Charles Odanga, the ward reps said the fate of the People’s Assembly with the people of Kenya. “The people we represent have sovereign power, they will decide where we will go next with the motion,” Odanga said. The High Court in Kitui issued orders barring county assemblies from passing or implementing the National Super Alliance’s motion to form the People’s Assembly. Kakamega was among the first counties to adopt the motion. NASA leader Raila Odinga was to be sworn as President by the People’s Assembly, but the swearing-in was postponed. Odanga said Raila is still strong and Kenyans should not write him off. “Raila is a wise man and a statesman. He will never let this country plunge in chaos. He has always been a liberator,” he said. Marama South William Opuka said it will be sad for the ambitions of millions of Kenyans to go down the drain under the Jubilee administration. Opuka said postponing the swearing-in should not mean the journey for liberation is over. Isonga Malaha MCA Lucas Radoli backed his colleagues. He urged Raila’s supporters to maintain the peace and wait for direction from the party leadership. Radoli, the chairperson of the health committee in the house, said the current regime can’t guarantee citizens proper services. Speaking separately, Marama North MCA Edwin Nandwa said any motion moved in the county assembly seeks to change resident’s lives. “I am not a lawyer but I know formation of the People’s Assembly is not going overboard,” he said.
