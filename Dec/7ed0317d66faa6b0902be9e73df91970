The defender at the same time conceded that their stay in the top tier is as good as over and they will have start a fresh once they are relegated.

These are things that we hope to make amends in future,” said Obushuru. He added: “Since we are in the final lap of the season, we hope to register some wins here and there in the remaining matches and increase on our points tally.” Click here for more political news
