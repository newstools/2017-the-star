Owners of unapproved structures in Kitengela town woke up yesterday to find them razed.  The county government had warned owners of illegal and unplanned structures to bring them down voluntarily.  Instead, the traders on Saturday held demonstrations against the warning.  They accused the county government of not giving them ample time to move after the expiry of the 21 daysâ€™ notice.  More than 100 inspectorate officers destroyed the kiosks and containers carrying valuables.  By 4am, the operation was complete and the officers left to avoid confrontation with the traders.  At around the same time, looters are said to have stolen what was left.
