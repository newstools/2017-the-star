Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati has warned corrupt officials in his government, saying they will not be spared. He addressed residents at Webuye Rai Paper Stadium on Tuesday at a Jamhuri Day rally. Wangamati said the previous regime under Kenneth Lusaka, currently the Senate speaker, robbed wananchi of their right to development. He asked all county staff to unite and work together to foster development. In September, the governor suspended protocol officer Joseph Kubende for allegedly attempting to defraud someone out of Sh400,000. The county boss told his executives they have an opportunity to serve residents, not exploit them. Wangamati said he is not afraid of firing anyone who wants to derail his administration. Wangamati said he has received reports of graft cases at the Nzoia Water and Sewerage Company from the public and he is looking into it. He promised to take firm action against anyone in the water agency found to have embezzled taxpayersâ€™ money. The governor said he will form committees to vet students who want bursaries. Wangamati has been criticised by county staff unhappy with his bid to block unapproved allowances.
