Kenyan duo of Ryan Randiek and Albert Njogu crashed out of the third leg of the ITF East Africa Under 18 tournament at the Nairobi club. Randiek lost to Zyan Ahmed of Great Britain 6-4 , 6-2 while Albert Njogu lost to Erick Vanshelboim of Ukarine 6-3,3-6 and 6-1 in the third round respectively. Despite the disappointing loss duo vowed to come back strong in the Karen Open which is set to commence on Saturday Randiek found the going tough in the hands of Britain national Ahmed who advanced to the quarters  The opening set was evenly contested between the two players with Randiek giving a good account of himself before failing in the final two games of the set. In the second set set, Randiek led 2-0 but his game fell apart with Ahmed rallying from behind to win four games consecutively to win He praised his opponent for the resilience he had throughout the game and pledged to train for the forth coming Karen Open. “He was strong in the entire game where he returned my serves with ease.In most of the times I was defending and made me lose points. I did not make good use of the short balls and I feel that’s where I got it wrong. My focus now shifts to Karen Open where I aim to reach the final and probably win the crown.” said Randiek  His counterpart Njogu suffered a 6-3, 3-6 and 6-1 defeat to top seed Erick Vanshelboim to bow out  Njogu had levelled the set he had conceded but poor handling of volleys and scattering of serves in the final set saw him manage a single game in the decider  .He termed the top seed as an experienced and a tactical rich player “My opponent had outstanding tactics today and it was hard to break his serve in the final set. I scattered returns and made mistakes in handling volleys a tactic he thrived in.I will embark on serious training sessions for the Karen Open where I want to rectify the mistakes my coach identified in the circuit.”noted Njogu
