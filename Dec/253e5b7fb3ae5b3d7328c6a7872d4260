A 77-year-old widow from Nang’oma village in Matayos subcounty has been living in a crumbled grass-thatched hut that collapsed in March. Leonida Ajiambo is crying out for help from well-wishers. She has to crawl to get into or out of the hut. Pastor Phaustine Ogolla of the Embassy Christian Church has bought five iron sheets, but appeals for well-wishers to help so Ajiambo can have a decent house. Yesterday, Ajiambo said, “ I’m happy to see reporters. I’ve never had peace since my hut crumbled. I’m left to ponder hoping that a Good Samaritan may come to my rescue.” Ajiambo got married in Munami, Kakamega. Her husband and four children died, leaving her at the mercy of her in-laws. They neglected and frequently tortured her. Ajiambo’s brother, Michael Makokha, could not bear her suffering. He took her back to her parents’ home in 2015 and built her the one-room hut. Anthills destroyed the house. He is unable to build for her another house. “I hope local leaders will come to the rescue of my sister,” Makokha said.   Click here for the latest political news
