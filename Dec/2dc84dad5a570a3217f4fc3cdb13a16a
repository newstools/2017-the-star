Kyuso Knut branch boss Agnes Kambua has denied abandoning former Kitui Governor Julius Malombe for current county boss Charity Ngilu. Kambua was Malombe's running mate in the August 8 general election. The pair lost to Ngilu.Last week, Kambua visited Ngilu at the Governor's office in Kitui. Political analysts and residents say the move signaled Kambua's political stance. "Nothing can be further from the truth. I visited Ngilu as a teachers union representative," Kambua said.She spoke to the Star on phone on Sunday. She said Malombe already challenged Ngilu's win. She said teachers had gone to the Governor to ask for her financial support ahead of a Knut NDC in Mombasa this week. "We are in opposing political camps, but whenever need arises, I will always visit the Governor as the teachers' representative," Kambua said.
