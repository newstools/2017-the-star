Nandi Governor Stephen Sang has defended a list of 18 nominees for chief officers' positions. He told those dissatisfied to present their petitions to the county assembly.  He said as required by the Constitution, the list includes representatives for minorities, the marginalised and persons living with disabilities. Sang said the nominees underwent rigorous interviews by the county public service board before the names were forwarded to the assembly for vetting. He spoke at Ngechek village during a homecoming for Education executive Stanley Baliach. “One thing I know is that corruption fights back. After breaking the cartel that had derailed Nandi development agenda, I expect a backlash,” the governor said.
