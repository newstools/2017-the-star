Matayos MP Geoffrey Odanga and the Busia branch of Knut Saturday clashed over the poor performance in KCPE by schools in the constituency. Speaking during the burial of his niece Florence Mubweka in Bugeng'i village, Odanga called for urgent need to address "deteriorating performance standards" saying schools had slipped. "Out of 51 schools, 29 recorded drops in performance. In general, the subcounty registered a drop of six. We need to urgently know where we went wrong," Odanga said. He asked education officers to wake up and regularly visit schools and give reports. "It is time for action. We cannot continue to bury our heads in the sand when things are going wrong," Odanga said. Busia Knut official Lydia Nabwire told the MP to appreciate the efforts teachers put to achieve the results they did.  "Sometimes people underscore. It doesn't mean that our students will fail every year. Our schools will register better results next year," Nabwire said. Constituency Knut representative Joseph Wesonga said teachers tried their best. She said 2017 was a difficult year because of political campaigns.
