Police officers who were absorbed into National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) have complained of unpaid allowances. They said the perks have dropped from Sh35,000 when they were absorbed into the agency to Sh14,000 that most of them are currently paid. "We need a proper payment structure even it means all of us get paid Sh10,000. The variations, together with a 'shamble contract', is discouraging," an officer who sought anonymity for fear of reprisals said. More than 100 police were absorbed into the transport sector. A section of them accused their seniors of intimidation and harassment in the execution of their duties. "We work round-the-clock running after drunk divers at dangerous zones but get nothing in return. What we write are statements which have no basis," the officer said adding that the matter should be sorted in the wake of more work with the beckoning festive season. NTSA director general Francis Meja said he has not received any complaint from any of the officers attached to the regulatory body. He added that cops have and know the right procedures to follow in the event they have a grievance in line with their work. "I have not received any complaint from any cop. If they have any grievances, they know the channels to follow." Click here for the latest political stories
