A Nakuru court has declined to compel the Teachers Service Commission to reinstate a teacher accused of having a love affair with his student. Employment and Labour Relations Judge Steven Radido said the TSC did not violate Hezron Silunya’s rights in suspending him from Moi Girls’ High School-Eldoret and later transferring him to another school. “The court is satisfied that the process undertaken by the TSC was in compliance with the law. Silunya’s rights were not violated,”he said. Read: Why principals were transferred The TSC had received several anonymous letters dated January 17, 2014, from people signing off as parents’ representatives and students about the claims against Silunya. The commission proceeded to send a team of two investigators who found that Silunya had a case to answer. In March, Silunya was served with a letter of interdiction. One of the allegations, as outlined in the interdiction letter, was that Silunya was of immoral behaviour by having a love relationship with his student. It said, “On several occasions during the year 2013, you enticed her by buying her foodstuffs and gifts and on October 18, you had bought her a birthday cake and chips, leading to her sneaking into your house on November 10 at around midnight while you were a teacher at Moi Girls’ High School-Eldoret” Silunya denied the allegations and once the disciplinary hearing was concluded, the TSC found him guilty and suspended him for four months without pay. He was later posted to a new school, but he never reported. He sought an order to bar the TSC from transferring him and a declaration that his constitutional rights were violated.  Related: 2017: The year Education sector went through radical changes Click here for the latest political news
