A man who shot and killed a nurse at the Chiromo Lane Medical Centre in Nairobi’s Westlands area has been remanded for 14 days at Industrial area prison pending medical exam and further investigations. Justice Jesse Lessit ordered that Joseph Njoroge be taken for mental treatment before pleading to murder charges after the prosecution asked for more time to also investigate him. He is accused of killing Faustine Mwandime on December 6 2017. Njoroge has not pleaded to murder charges. His Cliff Ombetta however had asked the court to grant the suspect bail as he had earlier been admitted to bail at a Magistrate court on December 8. Lessit however however ruled that the suspect need to be taken for mental exam and the claims by counsel of being released on bail was dismissed. "As far as i know in this case, the suspect has not been released on any bail and can not be granted the same with this court unless he was bailed in another matter", Lessit ruled. Last week Njoroge appeared before court but was taken to hospital after he said he was feeling unwell. According to police, the suspect who is a civilian licenced firearm holder went to the hospital at around 7am to seek treatment. He looked intoxicated when he arrived and the security guards asked him to leave the gun but he refused. Police allege the suspect mishandled the firearm at the hospital where he shot Mwandime after consultation. It is said that Njoroge was to be admitted after consultation but ended up shooting Mwadime before his admission. The deceased is alled to have been shot in the eye and forehead.The case will be mentioned on December 27
