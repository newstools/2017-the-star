The country’s apex court is today afternoon expected to deliver its full judgment on the dismissal of two petitions that challenged the October 26 presidential election. Six judges of the David Maraga-led Supreme Court will share their detailed judgment on why they upheld President Uhuru Kenyatta’s disputed victory. The judges had promised the country they would, within a period of 21 days, give justification for their unanimous decision to uphold the repeat presidential poll. On November 20, the judges threw out two presidential petitions and paved the way for Uhuru’s inauguration for a second and final term in office. The President was sworn in on November 28. However, opposition leader Raila Odinga has insisted he won’t recognise Uhuru’s presidency, vowing to ‘swear himself in’ as the People’s President tomorrow. The court found petitioners Harun Mwau, Khelef Khalifa and Njonjo Mue failed to show the poll was so fundamentally flawed to warrant a nullification. “The court has unanimously determined the petitions are not merited and the final orders are that the petition by Mwau versus the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission and two others as consolidated is hereby dismissed,” said the judges in their unanimous determination. Today, the six judges - Chief Justice Maraga, Njoki Ndung’u, Jackton Ojwang’, Smokin Wanjala, Isaac Lenaola and Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu will explain at length their decision. Unlike in the August presidential petition, this time no judge dissented. They must deliver the full judgment not later than today as provided for in the presidential petition rules.Mwau had accused the IEBC of acting in contempt.
