Kenya Hockey Union ( KHU) Premier League side, Kenya Police face another hurdle tomorrow against Greensharks at City Park hoping to bounce back with a win following last weekend 1-0 loss to Western Jaguars.  Police watched their 21-match unbeaten run come to an end at   the hands of Jaguars who mounted a bullet proof defence to pin Police to a 1-0 defeat. Kenneth Kaunda’s charges face another test when they confront third-placed and on-form Greensharks in the highlight match of the weekend.  Sharks trail Police by 12 points and reducing the gap to nine points will be a perfect recipe in resuscitating their dream of winning the premiership. A win for Police will take their points tally to 64 while a win for Sharks will move them second with 52 points—one ahead of Butali Warriors. Today, outgoing men’s champions Strathmore University Gladiators play relegation-bound Technical University while Nairobi Sikh welcome Western Jaguars. A win for sixth-placed Sikh will move them a place high while a win for 13th ranked Jaguars will see them go two places up.  Jaguars stand a chance to move five places high if they record straight wins in their double weekend fixture. The two men’s duels will later pave way for Mombasa Sports Club who face University of Nairobi in the women’s Premier League.  Eighth-placed Nakuru Hockey Club host ninth-ranked Parklands SC tomorrow at their backyard as Jaguars complete their weekend double against Strathmore Gladiators.  Mombasa Sports Club wrap up their Nairobi tour against ninth-lodged Multimedia  as third-placed Chase Amira face seventh-rated Vikings in a women’s Premier League affair.
