Nakuru Woman Representative Liza Chelule on Friday launched a campaign to "restore the dignity of boy child". This follows the dismal performance in academics and rampant prosecution of boys. Speaking to more than 200 initiates aged between 12 and 15, Chelule said she will not sit and watch as boys are prosecuted in courts. "Reports indicate that the largest percentage of rape and defilement cases in Nakuru involve boys. I decided to intervene and educate them on the implications of such behaviours," she said. Chelule asked parents to monitor their children's behaviour and counsel them. "I have started this campaign in the county's 55 wards to ensure our society doesn't run short of real men," she said. If boys are neglected, Chelule said, educated girls will in future lack good husbands. At the event, Boy Child Kenya chairman Samuel Karanja talked to the boys about the legal implications of sexual offences and harassment of female teens. "We have today taught more than 200 initiates of defilement-related behaviours that have led many of them to be jailed for years," Karanja said. The training was held at Keringet AGC Church. Kuresoi deputy county commissioner Emma Kibara warned parents against allowing boys to gamble, saying some of them drop out of school. "Most boys are failing because of the high rate of gambling. My chiefs are looking for businesspeople who allow boys in their premises," she said. Kibara urged parents to encourage their children to go to school since the government is offering free primary and secondary education. Â  Click here for the latest political news
