The hearing of an appeal by DPP Keriako Tobiko seeking to quash the acquittal of former Foreign Affairs PS Thuita Mwangi and two others in the Tokyo Embassy scam was yesterday adjourned until January 30. Mwangi jointly with former PS, former chargé d’affaires at the embassy Allan Mburu and former deputy director of administration in the ministry Anthony Muchiri had been accused of graft in authorising payment in the Sh1.3 billion scandal. This is after it emerged the building was bought at an inflated cost. Kenya allegedly lost Sh185.5 million in the purchase. The three were acquitted by Milimani Anti-Corruption Court chief magistrate Kennedy Bidali of graft charges for lack of evidence. However, the DPP later, through senior state counsel Daniel Karuri, filed an appeal in the High Court challenging the lower court decision. In his renewed bid to have Mwangi, Mburu and Muchiri held liable over the illegal purchase of the Kenyan Embassy in Tokyo, Tobiko said the decision to clear them was wrong and should be reversed.
