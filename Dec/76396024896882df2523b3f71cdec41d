The ruling on the election petition against the victory of Kisumu Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o will be made next Wednesday. This is according to a notice dated Friday December 29. “Take notice that the judgment in the High Court in Kisumu election petition of Jack Ranguma verses IEBC, county returning officer and Anyang' Nyong'o shall be delivered on Wednesday January 3, 2018,” the notice states.  Judge David Majanja had earlier said the court would give a notice of the ruling before January 30. He said the court will rely on the submissions made before it to make a decision.  Ranguma filed a petition before the court challenging Nyong’o victory at the August 8 General Election. Early last month, the court dismissed Ranguma’s application, seeking order for scrutiny and recount of votes. In his petition, Ranguma wants the court to overturn Nyong’o’s victory on grounds that the August election for Kisumu governor seat was not conducted within the confines of the Constitution. The former governor told the court the election was marred with irregularities. He accused Nyong’o of conspiring with the electoral agency to rig him out. But Nyong’o through his lawyers, James Orengo and Antony Oluoch, said the election was free and fair.
