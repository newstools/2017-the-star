Families of seven Kenyans being held in Uganda have called on President Uhuru Kenyatta to intervene and have their relatives released. This comes after last week’s intervention in which four Kenyans, jailed for life in South Sudan for alleged fraud against the Juba government, were freed. The seven — Habib Suleiman Njoroge, Muhammad Ali, Idris Magondu, Hassan Hussein Agade, Omar Awadh, Muhammad Hamid and Yahya Mbuthia — were renditioned to Uganda for alleged involvement in the 2010 bombings in Kampala. In May last year, the Uganda High Court handed down a life sentence to Magondu, Agade, Njoroge and Ali. Mbuthia, Hamid and Awadh were acquitted but were later rearrested. “As a family we have knocked on every door, reached out to everyone in government but the help has not been forthcoming. If I wasn’t a Muslim, I could have run out of patience and given up but will not,” Zeinab Hamid, mother of Hamid said. “Our sons were illegally taken to Uganda. We have been reaching out to the government for intervention so that they be brought here either to face trial or jail. They have been there for over six years. Others have been acquitted and now rearrested, but the quiet in government on the cases is appalling,” Aisha Suleiman, sister to Habib said. “These are sons of this country and there should be no double standards. We appeal to him to intervene the way he intervened in South Sudan issue,” Zeinab said. She said that sorting the issue legally is no longer tenable and it isonly political engagement that can bring a breakthrough. “All I pray is that the President can help, even have a prisoner swap so my husband can be brought and jailed here. So as his children can get a chance to visit him and get the fatherly love that every child yearns for,” Saida, Magondu’s wife said.
