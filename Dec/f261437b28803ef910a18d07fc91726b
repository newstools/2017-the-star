2017 is drawing to a close. It is time to celebrate Christmas with its tidings of peace and goodwill to all men. This year has been fractious. A disputed election and the subsequent run-off have divided the country rather than unified it. Opposition leader Raila Odinga is still threatening to swear himself in as president although there appears to be little popular appetite for this. We want 2018 to be a year of peace and harmony. For that to happen, the opposition needs to work through the democratic channels on Parliament, devolved government and civil society. But government also needs to demonstrate goodwill. Our divisions will not heal if government tries to crush civil society, roll back devolution, and illegitimately undermine opposition. There will be no coalition government but government and opposition should still respect each other. Government cannot function properly without an effective opposition to monitor it, while the opposition needs to accept government to ensure its relevance. Best wishes for a Merry Christmas and a Prosperous 2018 to all our readers. Â
