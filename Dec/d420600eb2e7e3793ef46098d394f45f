A Kenyan has been deported from Israel over suspicions of obtaining visa fraudulently into the country. Francis Kimani, who calls himself 'Yehudah Kimani', was denied entry into the Israeli airport by the Interior Ministry on Monday night. Kimani, 31, had gone to the Jewish state for a three-week study program, a move that was seen by activists as part of the ongoing discrimination by Israel against Jews. According to the Times of Israel, after Kimani’s first visa application was denied, he was able to obtain a visa on his second attempt, in time for the Conservative Yeshiva’s winter break program. When he arrived at Ben Gurion Airport, officials at the passport check said his visa was not valid. The Immigration department said Kimani was deported for fraudulently obtaining a visa to the country. He was placed on the next flight to Ethiopia where he lost his bag but he said he is still hopeful he will be able to return to Israel at a later date. "They just told me to go back, I feel like I’m not a human," Kimani said from the Addis Ababa airport. It is believed that Kimani is a leader of the 50-member Kehilat Kasuku. This is a small group of families in Kenya who decided to leave Messianic Judaism in the early 2000s. A retired judge Justin Philips, invited Kimani as a guest to study at the Conservative Yeshiva in Jerusalem for a short program. "There was no question on the visa form asking for that, and if they want that information they should ask for it.This is naked racism," Philips said. Kimani, who studied tourism and hopes to run a kosher safari company in Kenya in the future, is overseeing the final stages of building the library. Click here for the latest political news
