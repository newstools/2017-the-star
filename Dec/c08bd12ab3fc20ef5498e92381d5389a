Some 20 senior officers in Embu county were sworn in on Friday night after the Assembly hurriedly approved them in the wake of a suit blocking their appointment. MCAs unanimously approved of Governor Martin Wambora's nominees after which they were sworn in at 7pm on Friday. Ex-Kiambere MCA Martin Mwangi asked the High Court to block the approval of the 17 chief officers. He argued in his application that Wambora discriminated against Mbeere subcounties when selecting officials. He wants the court to compel the Governor to review the appointments so that he complies with regional balance. Judge Florence Muchemi asked Mwangi to serve Wambora, the County Assembly and Public Service Board with suit papers for an interpartes hearing on Monday. MCAs dismissed claims that they rushed to approve the names because of Mwangi's suit. Majority leader Michael Njeru said they were trying to beat the 14-day deadline for vetting and approval of officers. Click here for the latest political news
