Masinde Muliro University (MMUST) is in the process of setting up a Sh30 million gymnasium for Sports Science, Paramedic Science, Cosmetology and Beauty Therapy students. Vice chancellor Fredrick Otieno disclosed this during the ground breaking ceremony last week. He said they have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Body Flex GYM for the project expected to be complete by April 2018. "Students need to practice a wide range of skills including instruction, rehabilitation and assessments." "The facility will also be used in preparation of university teams participating in football, rugby, and netball," Prof Otieno said. The varsity boss claimed they spend at least Sh29 million annually on treatments of staff "for conditions that could easily be prevented through regular exercise." "The gym will also offer rehabilitative programmes critical in prevention and management of lifestyle health complications among staff, students and the community at large." Issah Kweyu, health and sports science chairman at the university, said the local community will benefit from the facility. Body Flex Gym director Adolf Shihemi said once complete, the facility will host a studio, cafeteria and changing rooms as well as a swimming pool.   Click here for the latest political news
