One person was shot dead and another injured after more than 40 suspected Turkana bandits raided the Nadome border of Baringo and Turkana counties on Sunday. The Turkana bandits broke into four homes that belong to Pokots around 2am. They made away with more than 50 head of cattle. A source told the Star that upon being alerted by the shots, Pokot gunmen responded and killed one Turkana youth. “One Pokot youth sustained a bullet injury in his left leg during the fire exchange,” the source said. Amid the battle, Turkana gunmen threatened to prolong the attacks against their neighbouring Pokot pastoral community. “The battle will continue … we will utilise the moonlight throughout this December holiday to attack you further, so you should prepare and buy yourselves more guns,” one Turkana member told the Pokots. Baringo county police commander Smollets Munyanzi denied claims of attacks, saying the gunshots were caused by the GSU officers patrolling the area. “The problem with the residents is that they are living in fear, so if they hear any gunshot they think the enemy has attacked,” he said. Tension is still high in Nadome and Kapedo following renewed enmity sparked between the Pokot and Turkana. On November 19, armed Turkana youth killed three Pokots near Kapedo while returning home from Ameyan market. On November 21, angry Pokots fought back and killed one Turkana. On the same day, the Turkana shot dead two Pokots in Kapedo. Ameyan market has been shut down since Sunday last week. Transport has been disrupted between Chemolingot and Kapedo heading to Lomelo and Nadome in Turkana East. Tiaty subcounty politicians have called for urgent peace talks to end the clashes.
