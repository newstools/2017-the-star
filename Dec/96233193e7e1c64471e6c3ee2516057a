Doctors at the Thika Level 5 Hospital were on Friday left in shock after removing 13 needles lodged inside a 10 month-old baby. The mother, Jacinta Ndunge, said she did not know how the needles got into her daughter's body. The pins were found in the girl's buttocks and thigh. Two weeks ago, Ndunge rushed the baby - Jane Wairimu - to hospital. She suspected a Pneumonia attack. The girl was then admitted. It was at the hospital that she noticed a sharp object on her daughter's thighs. She alerted nurses on duty who later called a doctor. "The doctor discovered that my daughter had a needle inside her buttocks. He performed a surgery to remove it but later realised there were more needles lodged inside the baby," Ndunge said. The 31-year-old mother of four said doctors discovered 14 needles. They removed 13. The last one was said to have penetrated the hip bone. "It requires special attention," Ndunge said. Kiambu county chief officer for health Joshua Toro confirmed the incident. He said the child was stable. “Removing an object like that from the child’s body is dangerous and can damage blood vessels and nerves. It can also trigger infections and even lead to death," Toro said. Doctors could not tell how the needles got into the baby. “I’ve never seen a case like this. Seeing the X-Ray was very scary," Ndunge told the Star at her home in Kiganjo estate. She thanked the doctors and expressed hope that the last needle would be removed.
