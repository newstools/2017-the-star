A family is seeking justice for their son, who was allegedly beaten to death by matatu crew. Joseph Kiarie, a former Maseno University Student leader, died at the Neema Uhai Hospital after he was attacked by touts and drivers of Zuri Genesis Sacco and Marimba Investment Sacco following the accident in Zimmerman on December 24. Police are yet to arrest the killers of 33-year-old motorist who was beaten to death by matatu crew, three days later. He was driving out of a car wash in Zimmerman when his car was grazed by a matatu. Kiarie and the matatu crew are said to have differed over cash payment for the incident and the touts and drivers are reported to have attacked Kiarie. According to witnesses, Kiarie was outnumbered by drivers and conductors of the saccos, when he tried to demand compensation for the damage caused to his vehicle. The matatu which killed the man was involved in a minor accident and has since been towed to Kasarani police station, but the crew is yet to be questioned.
