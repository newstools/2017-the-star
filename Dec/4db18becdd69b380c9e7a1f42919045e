The High Court has temporarily barred Interior CS Fred Matiang’i from renewing NGO Coordination Board executive director Fazul Mahamed’s tenure. Employment and Labour Relations Court judge Hellen Wasilwa further certified as urgent the case filed by activist Okiya Omtatah. “An interim order is hereby issued restraining the CS Interior and Coordination and his agents from renewing, reappointing or in any way whatsoever extending Fazul’s contractual tenure as the executive Director of the NGO board which expired on November 23 pending the inter partes hearing of this application,” the judge ordered. In the petition, Omtatah faulted the CS for failing to begin by July 24 the process of competitively re-appointing or replacing Fazul. He argued Matiang’i ought to have sent Fazul on terminal leave and appointed an acting executive director on or about June 23. Omtatah said he is aggrieved that in defiance of the law, Fazul continues to be in office. “It will be irregular and contrary to both the Constitution and statute to retain Fazul in the Public Service after the expiry of his contract.” Omtatah said. He wants the court to prohibit the respondent from extending Fazul’s contractual tenure and order the recruitment of a new NGO boss according to the law. The court declined to issue orders prohibiting Fazul from accessing the offices of the NGO Coordination Board and from carrying out his functions. The matter will be mentioned on December 18.
