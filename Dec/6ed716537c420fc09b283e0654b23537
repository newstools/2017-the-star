Uasin Gishu has adopted a mobile money payment system for parking fees following the theft of Sh5 million by revenue staff. Forty two staff from the revenue department were suspended two weeks ago. The county will now use Safaricom's M-Pesa platform to seal loopholes that have led to revenue loss. ICT, Trade and Industrialisation executive Emily Kogos is leading a team in teaching vehicle owners about the new system. "This plan offers parking rights to only those who have paid," she said on Tuesday. Persons wishing to pay are required to go to the M-Pesa menu on their phones, enter Paybill number 646464, their vehicle's registration number as the business number and pay Sh100 for parking daily. Kogos said investigations were ongoing to reveal details of the theft believed to have occurred in July, August, September and October. The suspects allegedly presented fake banking slips to the county, claiming to have deposited the parking fees they had collected. Chief finance office Peter Chesos confirmed the officers were sent home to facilitate investigations into the theft, mostly in the parking department. "The workers were given letters and asked to show why they should not be disciplined over the financial malpractices," she said.Â "We suspect they took advantage of the elections period to engage in diversion of revenue." Governor Jackson Mandago warned that the county will not tolerate misuse of public funds or resources. Click here for the latest political news
