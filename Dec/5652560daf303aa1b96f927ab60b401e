Deputy President William Ruto should reconcile with former President Daniel Moi before the 2022 presidential election, Kajiado politician David Sankori has said. Sankori, who was an assistant minister in Moi's administration, said Ruto needs the former head of state's
blessing before asking Kenyans to give him votes in the next presidential
election. He said the Kalenjin community should remain
united to be able to go to the next general election as a bloc. "The Maa community are concerned about the need for
Ruto and Moi to reconcile. We are ready to support a Kalenjin president
in the next election but we should be told if Gideon Moi will oppose Ruto in
2022," Sankori said Rift Valley is not united
like during former president Moi’s era because his son and Ruto have never sat
together as brothers. "I am ready to be part of the reconciliation
team. We need a serious team of elders from Rift Valley to travel to Kabarak to
meet with Mzee Moi. Ruto needs Moi more because the former president has
nothing to lose." The politician said Kajiado Maasai supported
Jubilee in the last election because they had full confidence with the
president and the DP. "We also believe Ruto can make a good leader
and this is the reason we are asking him to seek Moi's blessings which he badly
needs," the politician, who is representing South Rift in the national
council of elders, said. Sankori spoke barely a day when President Uhuru
Kenyatta told the nation he has no interest in politics anymore because he will
not be vying for presidency in 2022. The President spoke at KICC on Friday evening
when he appealed to politicians to shun politics and direct their energies in
developing the country. Read: Gideon Moi seeks influence in new Uhuru Cabinet Click here for the latest political news
