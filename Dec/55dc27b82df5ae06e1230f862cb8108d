The government has started converting Kenol-Murang’a-Sagana road into a dual carriageway. The Kenya National Highways Authority has started designing the highway. Kenha has hired a private company to design the 41km stretch passin through Murang’a town from Kenol town to Sagana town. The government announced it would construct the dual carriageway in February last year. This followed complaints by leaders that another one, which is to be constructed on the Kenol-Sagana highway, would hurt Murang’a town. The President directed the dual carriageway rerouted to Kenol-Murang’a-Sagana-Marua, saying he had heard the pleas of Murang’a leaders. The leaders said most people travelling from Nairobi to lower parts of Nyeri county prefer to use the Murang’a-Othaya route, which is shorter by 10km. But the directive sparked protests in Kirinyaga county.Then-Governor Joseph Ndathi said many towns on the Kenol-Sagana road would be reduced to ghost towns if the dual carriageway were diverted to Murang’a.
