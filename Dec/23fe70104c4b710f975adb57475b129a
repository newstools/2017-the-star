Â  Director of Public Prosecutions Keriako Tobiko Thursday withdrew the Sh8 billion Karen land corruption case against former NSSF boss Josephat Konzolo and five others. Milimani Anti-Corruption Court senior principal magistrate Lawrence Mugambi allowed the withdrawal, saying the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission was not properly constituted when the suspects were investigated and charged. "After consultation with EACC and DPP, my boss is of the view to have the matter withdrawn following an appellate court ruling where a graft case against former Transport CS Michael Kamau was terminated on grounds that the EACC was not properly constituted during the period of investigation and prosecution," senior state counsel Fredrick Ashimosi said.
