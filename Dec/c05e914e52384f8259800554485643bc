The EACC has summoned 35 MCAs  over the fracas that occurred in the Murang’a county assembly last week on Monday. The MCAs have received individual letters asking them to go to the Integrity Centre to record statements on different dates. The letters indicate the commission is investigating allegations the MCAs attacked assembly clerk Chris Kinyanjui on November 27. “The commission has reason to believe that you are in possession of information that can aid in the investigations and would like to interview and record your statement on the matter,” the letters read in part. The MCAs stormed the clerk’s office in an attempt to eject him over claims he had flouted procurement procedures by overseeing the procurement of substandard sports uniform during the Kenya Inter-counties Sports and Culture Association games held in Machakos county two weeks ago. The MCAs also wanted Kinyanjui investigated over claims he has travelled out of the country many times. Kinyanjui said the bone of contention between him and the MCAs stems from his refusal to approve their mortgages and car loans without security. He also claimed the MCAs demanded allowances for two extra days for the sports event which ran for five days. Speaker Nduati Kariuki confirmed the MCAs have been summoned, adding he is investigating claims from both parties. “We are investigating claims the assembly is being mismanaged and the alleged misappropriation of money during the Machakos sports event,” he said. Nduati was on a personal visit outside the country when the incident occurred. He said he held a meeting with MCAs on Friday during which they denied storming into the clerk’s office and attempting to eject him.
