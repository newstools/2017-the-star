The Migori government loses Sh800 million annually, more than entire county health department budget, due to poor sanitation. Tom Odhon’g, deputy public health officer, said 36 per cent of residents still defaecate in the open. “Improving sanitation and hygiene not only generates considerable economic benefits, but makes better living environment,” he said. Odhon’g spoke on Thursday at Getong’anya Centre, Kuria West Sub-county, during World Toilet Day. The event was hosted by Chuodho Women's Group. The day is celebrated on November 16, but the celebrations were postponed because of uncertainty over the November 26 repeat presidential election. John Okeyo, the group's director, said 75 villages in Kuria West are open defaecation-free as each homestead now has a latrine. Some 4,800 handwashing facilities have been installed in the villages, four schools and four health facilities. “We have targeted 4,339 households and 24,794 people in the villages with proper toilets including people living with disability,” Okeyo said.
