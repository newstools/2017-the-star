A Homa Bay court yesterday ordered a recount of votes for MP in 53 polling centres in Nyatike constituency. Judge Joseph Karanja, who heard the petition filed by Fredrick Odiso challenging the victory of MP Tom Odege, made the decision after lawyers in the case agreed to a recount. Odiso had initially wanted the court to nullify the election of Odege on grounds it was marred by irregularities. But Odiso’s lawyer Steve Biko, IEBC lawyer Fredrick Orego and Odege’s lawyer Kennedy Okong’o agreed on a recount before concluding the case. “We hope the recount of the votes in the queried polling centres will help in fast-tracking the case to its conclusion,” Okong’o said. Aonge Dhiang, Wang’e Long’o, Thimlich, God Bim and Got Kachola are some of the areas a recount will be done. Biko said, “The recount of votes in the disputed polling centres will enable us to know the irregularities committed by the electoral commission in the election.” Karanja agreed with the lawyers and said, “The petitioner will abide by the outcome.” The recount will be done at the IEBC warehouse at Macalder between Wednesday and Saturday. The lawyers argued there is not enough space in the IEBC offices in Migori town.
