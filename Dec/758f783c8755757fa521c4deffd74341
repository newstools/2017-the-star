NASA’s motion to form a People’s Assembly suffered another setback on Wednesday after the Nairobi assembly refused to allocate time for debate. Minority chief whip and Makongeni MCA Peter Imwatok has failed twice to give a notice of motion. The House Business Committee, which allocates time for debate, cited an injunction issued on November 20 by the High Court in Kitui. It temporarily restrains all county assemblies from passing or implementing motions on formation of People’s Assemblies, pending determination of a case filed by the Counties Development Group lobby. Some assemblies have disregarded the order and adopted the opposition-driven motion; Mombasa is the latest one.

But he said he would not allow debate even if there were no court order. In the draft motion seen by The Star, the People’s Assembly is described as a remedy to electoral and other injustices that Kenyans have suffered. “A People’s Assembly will be formed to discuss and determine affairs of the country and recommend a path to achieve the promise, aspiration, objectives and rights and freedoms provided by the constitution,” it says. The Makongeni MCA argued President Uhuru Kenyatta was not validly elected on October 26 because of the low voter turnout.  NASA chief Raila Odinga withdrew and called for a boycott by his supporters. IEBC reported a victory of 98 per cent of total votes cast and a turnout of 38.84 per cent. Imwatok will have trouble convincing the Jubilee-dominated House to approve the motion. Jubilee Party has 65 members and NASA 58. But he said: “We have a strategy to ensure this goes through." The MCAs are to break for recess on Wednesday and resume sittings in February.
