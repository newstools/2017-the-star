Two Catholic priests have asked Kenyans to use the love of their family for better relations that will lead to the unity of Kenyans following divisions over the recently concluded election. They spoke on Saturday at Consolata Shrine in Westlands, Nairobi where former Vice President Moody Awori led the faithful in celebrating family day. Families drawn from the larger Nairobi parish gathered at the church for a get together. There were games before food was served. Awori only greeted the congregation before proceeding to cut the cake. The ex-VP did not make a statement.   During the evening mass, Father Daniel Bertea said: "Family day should bring hope to the hopeless and bring peace to Kenya." He preached the message of hope and self-renewal in the wake of political tensions brought by a gruelling divisive election process.
