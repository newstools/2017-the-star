Governor Alfred Mutua has called for faster disbursement of funds by the national treasury. Speaking to the media on Friday, Mutua expressed disappointment, saying that cash in county governments has been delayed, hindering running of important activities. He said this has led to disruption of projects and delay in payment of staff. "We have not initiated any county project since we were elected," he said. The county boss asked other politicians in the counties to give governors time to implement devolution fully without interference. "County governments have scored above average despite not getting sufficient funds from the national treasury. There are still development projects that we have done with the little funds we get," he said. He proposed for a cooperation among leaders to spearhead development in counties saying its the only way to reap fruits of devolution. "There are some politicians who lost elections and now they want to destroy the work other leaders are doing," he said. Mutua said he is ready to strike good relationship with other Governors for the sake of unity. "Its time we stop the unnecessary fights we have had amongst ourselves and work to serve the people," he said. He added that, he will welcome any idea of development for the betterment of his county.
