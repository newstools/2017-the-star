Competitors in the Miss Tourism contest in Kitui shocked the audience with their lack of knowledge of the new government structure. Many of them failed all the questions on the county government structure at Mwingi subcounty offices at the weekend.  “They don’t know their ward administrators. Not even Mwingi Central subcounty administrator Stephen Salee, who was the first to introduce himself,” Mue Maluki, who attended the contest, said. One of the contestants told the media the questions caught them unawares.  “The structure is confusing. I’m sure I will still fail the same questions if I don’t cram,” she said.  Subcounty administrator Stephen Salee urged contestants to learn about the national and county government structures for their own benefit. He said ignoranrance is not good.
