Pastor Douglas Mutua of the Global Ministries, Langas estate in Eldoret, surprised residents when he recorded a statement, pleading with the police to help him find his wife. Margaret Mutua, his wife of 16 years and a mother of two, left a week ago after they argued over a text message from another man. “She is my lovely wife and I need her back. I have forgiven her and she should forgive me. The family needs her and we are suffering”, Mutua said. He did not give details of the text message but insisted that all he needs now is for his wife to come back to the family. “We differed but we did not fight and after that she just disappeared from the house. Our child is suffering, please come back home because I love you”, he said. He said he was ready to receive back his wife unconditionally.
