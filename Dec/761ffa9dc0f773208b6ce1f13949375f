Betting and gaming firms suffered a major blow after the High Court dismissed their legal bid to nullify a law that will raise the tax rate on gambling. The tax hike that imposes a tax of 35 per cent of gross profits on all gambling, is now set to take effect on Monday 1st January 2019 But how exactly does this affect sports in Kenya and more so, the biggest sports sponsor in the country, SportPesa?   Here are a few questions that you may be asking:   1. Will SportPesa pull out of Kenya completely? Absolutely not. It can be confirmed that SportPesa has no intention of leaving the country. Kenya will remain their base of operations for the foreseeable future.   2. Will SportPesa scale down operations, at least? The operations of the company remain unchanged for the time being.   3. Is the rumor that SportPesa is now withdrawing all their sponsorship true? Following the court ruling upholding the 35% tax to be imposed on all betting, lotteries and gaming activities, SportPesa has today communicated to all its local partners its intent to withdraw the full value of our sponsorships as of 1st January 2018. While it is sad news that the company has to scale down its measure of participation in local sports, it must be appreciated, understandably, that no business can sustain operations under the conditions of this heavy tax burden. The confirmed withdrawal of sponsorship includes the following entities: 1. Gor Mahia Football Club  Gor Mahia FC celebrate with the SportPesa Super Cup trophy after beating arch rivals AFC Leopards.
