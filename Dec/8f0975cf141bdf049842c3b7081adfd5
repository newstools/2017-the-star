Sirisia MP John Waluke has dismissed NASA leader Raila Odinga's planned as inconsequential because the presidency is already occupied. He told journalists in Eldoret on Sunday that the swearing will only be an attempt by the Opposition chief to remain politically relevant. "It will not help him in any way. He should end this year by quitting politics for younger generations to take over in the opposition," Waluke said. "Odinga (Raila) will be taking oath as who or to be what. May be as president of Gor Mahia or AFC Leopards. The teams also have their leadership in place." Waluke said the NASA leader has outlived his political "sell by" date and that it is time he exits the political scene. The MP said some of the former premier's close allies were misleading him to stage an oath ceremony that would end up being an embarrassment to him and the opposition. "The whole world knows that Uhuru won two elections in which Raila was a candidate and lost. There is no way he can claim to have won." He said the Luhya community stands to benefit more from the Jubilee administration and not through supporting the opposition. "Soon, we expect so many government appointments and we know President Uhuru Kenyatta will consider all Kenyans including my community." The MP said he is ready to serve in any other position including that of Cabinet Secretary should the president decide to appoint him. "The most important thing is that we should support Uhuru and DP William Ruto so that they serve Kenyans with the mandate they got through the ballot."
