It is a good thing that the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education examinations results have been released before the Christmas holiday.  Parents and students will have ample time to celebrate or prepare for the transition in the New Year, whichever way they receive them. But just like the KCPE last month, the KCSE results were announced abruptly without advance notice to the public or the concerned parents and candidates.  At a time when the country is getting used to predictable timelines, such an ambush is not to be celebrated.  It is important that the education ministry sets clear calendar dates by when results of all examinations will be known to avoid unpredictable stunts that shudder, shock or keep families on tenterhooks. This rhythm of predictability should extend to the unpredictable graduation fares in our universities, so that students and their families are not exposed to undue anxiety. Similarly, the reforms initiated under Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i’s watch, which have raised standards and eliminated cheating, should be institutionalized as part of the education sector regulations.
