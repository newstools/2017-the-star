Hundreds of KCSE candidates from 10 schools did not receive their results yesterday following suspected malpractice in the institutions. Education CS Fred Matiang'i said a team will scrutinise results and release its findings on January 18. "Our examiners noted clear evidence of collusion. I know people will ask us to prove this allegations and that is why we have asked for more expertise," he said.

In 2015, results of 5,101 students were cancelled - a figure deemed the highest in the history of examinations in the country. This translated to a 70 per cent rise in the number of cases of irregularities compared to the 2,975 cases reported in 2014.  Yesterday, Matiang'i narrated how one school in the Rift valley engaged them in frustrating behaviours during the 2017 exams. "They have engaged in frustrating malpractice. Every senior officer went to that school because of the problems we had," he said. "The principal of this school took the cell phones and put them in a bucket of water. It indicates their desperate efforts," he said. Matiang'i said the board of the school will be de-registered and did not name the schools affected. Click here for the latest political news
