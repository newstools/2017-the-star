Bus companies plying the Mandera-Nairobi route, who two weeks ago refused to carry non-locals for fear of being attacked by al Shabaab, may soon resume operations. The three bus companies allegedly refused to carry non-local travellers following previous incidents. In 2014, suspected al Shabaab militants attacked a bus plying the route. They shot at the non-locals, where 28 were killed. Most of them were teachers travelling for the December holidays. Since the incident, most bus companies still have the fear that during the festivities the same might happen. Al Shabaab militia know most non-locals use buses to travel to their rural homes. Non-locals who could not afford alternative means, like flying, were caught in the stand- off. But Northeastern regional commissioner Mohamud Saleh said security escort has not been withdrawn as alleged by the bus companies. “The two security vehicles that escort buses along the route were burnt down but we have replaced them. The terrain is rough and we could not dispatch used vehicles,” Saleh said.  He added: “We expect normalcy to return. We are aware of the fact that al Shabaab may use this festive season to attack. We shall step up patrols along the border, major government installations and areas prone to attacks.” Saleh said although there has been a major improvement of security in the last two years, threats by the Somalia-based al Shabaab group are still a genuine concern. “As long as Somalia remains unstable, al Shabaab will remain a threat to the security of this country. We urge residents to continue volunteering information on suspicious people so that appropriate action can be taken,” he said. The Star has learnt that one bus company now uses the Mandera-Moyale route, which is relatively safer.
