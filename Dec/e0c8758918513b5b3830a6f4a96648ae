Taxi and boda boda operators took to the streets of Maralal town on Wednesday in protest against high fuel prices. They said petrol station managers in the Samburu town refused to lower prices in line with recommendations by the Energy Regulatory Commission. All the stations in the area were closed down, operators saying they could not sell petrol at Sh107 and diesel at Sh97. Mohammed Sadik of Bhola filling station said sticking with ERC prices would get them out of business. "We can only sell petrol at a minimum of Sh125 and diesel at Sh116," Sadik said on Tuesday. In response, the taxi and boda boda operators marched to the county commissioner's office and demanded audience. Commissioner Alfred Kinyua promised to engage all the stakeholders for a solution. But the demonstrators asked the regulator to crack the whip on petrol stations charging higher prices. "We want ERC to close down these petrol stations. They can be operated by business people who have the people's interests at heart," said taxi driver Erastus Nkong. The business people noted they have to refuel in Nyahururu town, about 250 kms away. Justus Jumbe, a boda boda rider, said a group of transporters will open a petrol station. He asked stations to cut their "hunger for more money" so their businesses wouldn't suffer.
