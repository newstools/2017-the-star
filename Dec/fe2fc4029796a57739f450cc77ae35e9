Lack of political goodwill, bureaucratic red tape and conflicts of interest are to blame for entrenched corruption in the country, a People’s Anti-Corruption Summit was told yesterday.  University of Nairobi don Patrick Asingo said corruption is rife because there were less risks for those involved. He said governance institutions had failed to punish those implicated in graft. In preliminary findings of research on corruption, Asingo said incompetent people have been appointed to key positions, allowing looters to exploit opportunities to engage in graft.  “At times, there is a deliberate move to appoint those with the baggage so that when they want to do the right thing, they are reminded how they were not the best option,” Asingo said. He called for sincere commitment to fight the war on corruption.He spoke at the antic-corruption summit in Nairobi. The summit was organised by the Kenya Human Rights Commission to commemorate International Anti-Corruption Day.  “There is need to profile and classify corruption and those involved in the embezzlement of public resources as ‘thieves’ who deserve societal ignominy and dishonour,” Asingo said.
