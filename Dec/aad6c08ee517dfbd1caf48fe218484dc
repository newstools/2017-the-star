Thika MP Patrick Wainaina has said action will be taken on police officers dragging their feet in stemming crime.  The MP said there have been many incidents of prominent traders being killed and the cases not solved.  Wainaina cited the murder of businesswoman Joyce Wambui. She was found murdered at her home in Maki Estate on February 27. Trader Paul Kiarie, the second victim, was shot dead while entering his home in Kiganjo Estate on November 9.  The MP spoke on Saturday at Kihiu Mwiri at the burial of a renowned taxi driver in Thika town, Francis Kariuki. He was killed last week.
