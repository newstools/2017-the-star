Our examiners noted clear evidence of collusion," Education CS Fred Matiang'i said. Speaking at Nairobi School on Wednesday, Matiang'i said an team has been setup to scrutinise results that be released on January 18. "I know people will ask us to prove this allegations and that is why we have asked for more expertise," he said. Matiang'i narrated how one school in the Rift valley engaged them in frustrating behaviours during the exams. "They have engaged in frustrating malpractice. Every senior officer went to that school because of the problems we had," he said. "The principal of this school took the cell phones and put them in a bucket of water. It indicates their desperate efforts," he said. Matiang'i said the board of the school will be de-registered and did not name the schools affected.
