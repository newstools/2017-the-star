The National Cereals and Produce Board owes farmers more than Sh800 million for maize delivered to depots, mostly in Rift Valley, in the last month. The farmers have asked the government to release to the NCPB all the Sh6 billion set aside for maize purchase. “Farmers want to be paid instantly for their maize, especially now that Christmas is here and they have to plan early for next year,” said Kenya Farmers Association director Kipkorir Menjo. Two weeks ago the government paid farmers Sh600 million for maize deliveries. Currently, there are long queues at the NCPB depots as farmers continue to deliver more maize. The board has so far purchased more than 500,000 bags. Menjo says they have asked the board not to buy maize from importers because local farmers still have a lot of cereal. Officials of the board denied farmers’ claims that it buys imported maize from influential traders pretending to be local producers. Last week, the farmers protested at the board’s depot in Eldoret. They said the board gives the importers priority in both delivery and payment.
