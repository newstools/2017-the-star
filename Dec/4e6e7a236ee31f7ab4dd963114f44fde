Kenya cricket team coach Thomas Odoyo believes the 2018 Under 19 ICC World Cup provides the country with a chance to rebuild the sport at the lower levels. Odoyo, who was the captain of Kenyan team to the maiden ICC CWC in 1998, then known as ICC Junior World Cup, said the experience he got then formed the basis of his lengthy career. “My foundation is the U19 World Cup. We finished 11th but got an idea of how international cricket is played,” said Odoyo. “The earlier you get that experience, the better. There was a lot to learn for us — David Obuya, Francis Otieno, Andrew Mboya — as we went on to play for Kenya. There were also others who could not play for Kenya but did very well in domestically.” Kenya will be making their return at the event for the first time since 2002 in New Zealand this month and Odoyo is confident the Jimmy Kamande-led players will get a lot of experience needed at the international stage. “The under-19 Cricket World Cup is a great platform for youngsters as they get an early feel of international cricket. The tournament provides players the opportunity to not just iron out their flaws but also understand how things pan out in top tournaments,” observed Odoyo Kenya are pooled in Group ‘A’ alongside defending champions West Indies, immediate former champions South Africa and hosts New Zealand. Even though the Kenyan opponents look favorites due to their vast experience at the event, Odoyo has asked the players to work themselves in learning and not stressing themselves into winning. “I’d advise all players in the team to go out, enjoy the tournament and try to do their very best. At this age, the experiences that you gather are never forgotten. That kind of experience does not come again. Players learn a lot, which can’t be done from any other source,” he observed.
