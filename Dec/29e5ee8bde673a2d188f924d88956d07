 Benard Tungus and Hellen Chepkut are the winners of the 13th World HIV/AIDS Marathon staged in Kisumu yesterday. Tungus clocked 2:20:42 to clinch the men’s title while Chepkut won the women’s category in a slow time of 3:14:56 followed by the Jody Brodsky at 4:25:56.Brodsky is the wife of the founder of the marathon Richard. 27 year-old Tungus, from Kericho, said he was elated to have won his first race, although in hot and humid conditions and inspired to try his luck in more in future. Tungus participated in the Kilimanjaro Marathon in Tanzania in February, where he finished third but saw his ambitions to run at last month’s Chartered Nairobi Marathon go up in smoke after suffering a leg injury.  He was followed by another individual runner, Gideon Kipsang, who timed 2:23:54 while Bernard Nyakamba sealed the podium places in 2:24:45. Johnston’s Asige and Daniel Nyandigisicompleted the top five placings in respective times of 2:27:59 and 2:30:51 respectively. Chepkut said it has been three years since she participated in any race and was happy to have won.  “This is like a comeback because the last race I did was the 2014 Kilimanjaro Marathon where I finished third and after facing various challenges, I moved to Saudi Arabia to work as a house help,” she said. “The journey has not been easy for me but am now back and will participate in other races in the coming months.”
