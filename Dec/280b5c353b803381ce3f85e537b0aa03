A 16 percent increase in Bungoma county’s bloated 2016-17 wage bill has slowed development, a report has shown. The County Budget Implementation Review Report for the first three quarters shows the bill increased from Sh2.08 billion in the first half of 2015-16 to Sh2.41 billion in the last financial year. The report by Controller of Budget Agnes Odhiambo said the rising wage bill slowed development activities.  It says Bungoma spent Sh994 million on growth projects — only 26.7 per cent of the annual development budget of Sh3.37 billion. The expected spending/absorption rate should be about 75 per cent. “The county should identify and address issues causing delays in implementation of development projects,” the report recommends. In Busia county, the CoB raised concerns over the declining internal revenue collection.    PROBLEMS IN BUSIA TOO The report said revenue collection declined by 20.1 per cent from Sh256.6 million in the first nine months of 2015-16 to Sh205 million last year. The county has not established an internal audit committee to oversee financial operations, the report says. Odhiambo also said the two Western counties have not been channelling collections to the Revenue Fund Account at the Central Bank. This makes it difficult to ascertain the amount collected from internal sources. “An analysis of reports submitted to the OCoB indicates that while Sh205 million was collected locally, Sh189.2 million was banked into CRF [County Revenue Fund at CBK] during the reporting period,” it says of Busia. Section 109 of Public Finance Management Act, 2012 requires counties to deposit all their collections in their revenue accounts at the Central Bank. This makes it easier to audit and promote financial transparency and accountability.
