The Simbas new head coach will be unveiled in February. Sources familiar with the story indicate that the Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) board have started talking to friendly nations and World Rugby on a successor to South African Jerome Paarwater who was fired on Monday after a five-year stint. Interviews for the position will start next week and shortlist is expected by January before the holder of the office is announced. The source said that assistant coaches Dominique Habimana, who handles the forwards and Charles Ngovi, who handles the backs with team manager Wangila Simiyu will retain their roles as the new head coach arrives to familiarise himself with the systems and the players already in the set up. The selection process is set to be tweaked with Kenya Cup coaches also identifying new talent from the matches they will be involved, starting this weekend . Previously, the Kenya Simbas had four selectors, who used to scout for talent before giving the names to the technical bench for purposes of training and selection.  Paarwaterâ€™s sacking, the source said, will not damage relations between the union and his employer Western Province rugby union as the outfit had already been told of the impending decision by KRU board to severe ties with the coach. However, the proposed training camps Jerome had slated for January to April will remain, according to the board. Rugby enthusiasts have termed the sacking ill-advised and suspect especially with Kenya playing the Rugby World Cup qualifiers in June next year. They open the campaign against Morocco away in Rabat on June 23 before playing Zimbabwe a week later. They host Uganda on July 7 before the championship takes a four-week break occasioned by the Rugby World Cup Sevens from July 20-22 July in San Francisco, USA.
