Deputy President William Ruto forked out Sh12 million during the Kimalel Goat Auction in Baringo county on Thursday. The DP paid for 1,000 goats, which he will share with President Uhuru Kenyatta and their other friends. He sold 2,080 goats in a record 15 minutes. “Bring the money and take the goats. it is strictly cash. I don’t want to hear my name in the media with people saying some of us have gone with debts, like was the case the previous year,” Ruto said. In 2015, the Star published a story indicating that the DP and other politicians, among them ElgeyoMarakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen, Baringo North MP William Cheptumo and former Baringo Woman Representative Grace Kiptui went for close to a year without settling their over 2million debts, leaving farmers in a dilemma. “Check inside that bag over there, there is Sh12million…so arrange for 1,000 goats then you can sell the remaining to the other guests” the DP said  Each goat was sold for Sh12, 000, translating into Sh25 million. During last year’s auction farmers earned Sh28million. The remaining 1,080 goats were sold randomly to other guests.
