Britam Insurance Company (Uganda) Ltd has unveiled their new offices located in Nakasero suburb in Kampala. The offices, which were acquired from AIG, will host both Britam Insurance Company (Uganda) Ltd - the insurance arm of Britam Holdings Limited and Britam Asset Managers Company (Uganda) Ltd. Britam Asset Managers (Uganda) offers investment management and advisory services to pension funds, insurance companies, corporates, government-owned entities and retail investors. The company was launched on July 27, 2017. Allan Mafabi, the CEO, Britam Insurance, Uganda, said; “We are excited about our new spacious offices, which give us an opportunity to serve our customers better and offer the full range of diversified financial services to our customers under one roof.” He said that Britam, which entered Uganda’s insurance market in November 2010, has since grown to become the number three biggest insurer by premiums out of the 21 insurance companies operating in Uganda. Benson Wairegi, the Group Managing Director, said Britam would continue to further invest in the Ugandan market because of its great potential made possible by a conducive business operating environment. “Over and above our recent opening of an asset management company in Uganda, we are considering opening a property division as well in order to bridge the property and real estate gap in the country,” he said.
