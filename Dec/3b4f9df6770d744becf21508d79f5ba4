Fake information and hatred among residents are hampering the fight against insecurity in Kiambaa, police have said. Deputy county commissioner Peter Gicheha said residents were spreading malicious information against each other because of hatred. "Individuals only want to implicate each other with information that end up being fake after police investigations," Gicheha said. He said residents had formed Whatsapp groups where security information was shared. Gicheha said they had enhanced security patrols in Kiambaa. He asked residents to volunteer information about criminal gangs and stop blaming police for inaction. "We are doing our best to apprehend criminals. We need the support of residents," he said. He spoke on Monday, following Sunday's stabbing of a woman in Kiambaa. It was the latest case of stabbing after a man died of knife wounds in a local hospital. Edward Ndung'u was stabbed by unknown assailants on Friday last week, outside his home in Kabutu village, Muchatha. The woman was treated and discharged. "We are appealing to residents to cooperate with police. The gang doesn't steal anything from victims, a fact that points to a bigger picture," Gicheha said. Furious residents had taken to social media to mobilise themselves for a demonstration to condemn rising insecurity in the area. "It is time we demonstrated and blocked roads to demand an answer from Boinnet," David Ngugi posted on Facebook. Nyumba Kumi Initiative chairman Joseph Kaguthi, who toured the area yesterday, asked for the reconstitution of clusters for effectiveness. There are 526 Nyumba Kumi clusters in Kiambaa. "We can only have security by knowing each other," Kaguthi said.
