The tarmacking of roads in Ol Kalou town will be complete by June next year, officials have said.  Construction of the roads began late last year and was anticipated to take two years. Ol Kalou is the headquarters of Nyandarua county. The four-kilometre project is being undertaken by Don Woods Construction Company. Works manager Chris Wamugunda on Tuesday said most of the work, including formation, building sleeves and laying of culverts, was complete. He spoke when the contractor started laying bitumen on the roads. Governor Francis Kimemia had on November 14, accused the contractor of delaying the work.  Kimemia threatened to cancel the tender and give it to another contractor that was ready to deliver the work faster.  Wamugunda defended the contractor and attributed the delay to heavy rains which forced them to readjust their schedule.  Electricity poles and traffic have also posed challenges to the contractors. “We hope residents will be more patient with us,” Wamugunda said.
