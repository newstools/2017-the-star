Sports Journalists Association of Kenya (SJAK) President Chris Mbaisi has been elected as one of the four Vice Presidents of AIPS Africa. AIPS-Africa president Mitchell Obi of Nigeria retained his post unopposed alongside first vice Mourad Moutaoukil of Morocco.  In the other vice presidents’ vote, Mbaisi garnered 19 votes to headline the list alongside Amadou Dioulde Diallo of Guinea (18), Mufti Mohammed Saeed of Sudan and Yonas Teshome Getaneh of Ethiopia, who amassed 13 votes each. Kabulo Muanna Kabulo (Democratic Republic of Congo) lost out in the rerun after tying with Mofti and Yinas. “It’s a great honor to join the AIPS-Africa committee and I am looking forward to working hand in hand with Obi and the new team in making a difference in Africa,” said Mbaisi. William Dodzi Ezah of Ghana was elected the secretary general beating incumbent Emmanuel Gustave Samnick of Cameroon 13-9. Deputy secretary general is Anthonio Goncalves Ferreira of Angola who also went in unopposed alongside treasurer Felix Sohounde of Benin retained his post unopposed. Executive Members are Amadou Dioulde Diallo (Guinea)and Oumar Babba Traore (Mali). Meanwhile, the International Sports Press Association (AIPS) has asked its members to adopt the one third gender rule in the sharing of posts. President Giani Merlo said the association was under represented by women making the body seem to a male members club. He said it was unfortunate that there were no women in the AIPS Africa executive committee which was dominated by men. “I appreciate that the tenets of democracy dictate that you vote for the candidate of your choice but if having an all-inclusive executive then you have to be compelled,” he said.
