A special commemoration will on Saturday be held for former Kitui mayor Martha Mwangangi who was crushed to death by a county fire engine last December. Mwangangi had joined Governor Charity Ngilu is a demonstration in Kitui town when the speeding vehicle ran over her. Ngilu narrowly escaped. They were protesting the demolition of hawkers' kiosks by former Governor Julius Malombe's administration. The driver of the vehicle has since been charged with murder in a Kitui court. A statement from Ngilu's spokeperson Martin Masai said the governor will lead Kitui people in commemorating the first anniversary of the death of Mwangangi. "Ngilu will lay wreaths, amid prayers at the spot where the former mayor was killed," Masai said. Mwangangi's eldest son Mutia has distanced himself with the commemoration. He has asked the procession not to proceed to their home, saying the family was not consulted. "I need to be recognised as the head of the family. My sister cannot operate behind my back and purport to plan the event without our input," Mutia told journalists in Kitui town on Thursday.
