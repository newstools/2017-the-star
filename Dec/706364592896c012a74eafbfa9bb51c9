A musician who went missing over the weekend died in Thika Level Five Hospital on Monday. Steve Kamau went missing on Saturday night and was found dumped in Gaitumbi, Kiambu county on Sunday morning. The Nisisi band leader had dropped other musicians in town on Saturday after a gig in Rongai before heading home. He was found unconscious alongside an unidentified body. Area MCA Philip Mwihoti rushed Kamau to the nearby dispensary after which the musician was transferred to the hospital. The unidentified body was taken to City Mortuary. Kamau's car KCC 918F is still missing.  The band had earlier performed in KPA, Embakasi, where President
Uhuru Kenyatta launched a Sh22 billion Upgraded Inland Container Depot
on Saturday before heading to Rongai for a performance.  "He dropped us in town and proceeded home but when we called him the following day because we were to perfom in Githurai, we were not able to reach him. We later contacted his wife who told us he didn't get home," said bandmate Juvenalis Amonde. Family spokesman David Kangethe said Kamau had a deep cut on his head
possibly inflicted with an axe, while the other body had been
strangulation marks and a cut on the neck. "He could have been saved if he was found much earlier before bleeding excessively," Kangethe said. Kangethe said the family will file a formal report with police on Tuesday. Click here for latest political news Â
