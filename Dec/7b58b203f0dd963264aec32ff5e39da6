After helping his side to retain their status in the Sportpesa Premier League, Thika United’s talismanic captain Dennis Odhiambo has urged the club’s management to make improvements to the squad to avert the possibility of another relegation scrap. Thika beat Ushuru in a two-legged KPL promotion play-off, winning the first match 2-1 in at the Thika Sub county Stadium before settling for a 0-0 draw in Narok over the weekend. “I am aware the club had made contacts with several players who were non-committal as they wanted to await the outcome of our playoff match. Now that we have retained our status, I hope they will be convinced to join us because we really need to improve our squad,” Odhiambo remarked. Thika’s struggles in the last three seasons have been attributed to lack of experience within the squad with Odhiambo ­— now approaching 30 years ­— being one of the more mature heads of in the squad. Though coach Nicholas Muyoti managed to bring the best out of them enroute to survival, he will be acutely aware that bringing in players who have been tried and tested at the highest level will be of utmost priority if they are to stay clear of another relegation dogfight. Muyoti has often preferred discipline and hard work over mere talent, a mantra he posted in his social media page in the wake of their 2-1 aggregate win over the dogged taxmem. Onwudu Chibueze, their playoff hero fits in well with that philosophy and it is players like those that he will be looking for. But finances might undermine their quest for players with those qualities as majority demand six figure sign on transfer fees and salaries that exceed Sh50,000 per month, money that is in short supply at Thika right now.
