The Ministry of Education has approved literature books to be used in secondary schools between 2018 and 2022. In a directive to school heads across the country, Pius Mutisya, the director for Quality Assurance said the new books will replace those that have been in use since 2013. “The books for the period 2018-2023 have a running footnote on every page stating “Approved by KICD 2017 Edition” and “Kimeidhiniwa na KICD Tolep 2017” for English and Kiswahili respectively,” he said.
