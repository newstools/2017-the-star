  The government has been
urged to start counselling programmes for young couples and the youth to end
domestic violence. Thika-based
psychologist Gladys Chania said the rising cases of domestic violence
has many families grieving. She said children suffer when their parents quarrel. Chania spoke to the Star in
her Thika office on Thursday She spoke following
Tuesday' s incident, where a 32-year-old man at Kiganjo Estate in Thika stabbed
his two children to death after a domestic dispute with his wife. James Kioho also tried to commit suicide by taking
poison. Chania said the
country has many counsellors, whom the government can engage to help families solve disputes. "The state must
take up the matter seriously, because we cannot continue losing Kenyans to
domestic rows. The state should partner with private counsellors to avail vital services, especially to the young couples and the youths intending
to marry,"  she said. Chania said most
cases of domestic rows involve young
couples. She also called on
lawmakers to come up with a policy that will ensure children in
families where there are wrangles are rescued are catered for. "Innocent children
should be protected by the state from being tortured or even murdered by their
parents, because of their differences," she said.
