A group under Nairobi Informal Settlements Youths Movement have appealed to Jubilee Party to nominate former Kamukunji MP Simon Mbugua to the East African Legislative Assembly. Speaking in Nairobi at the weekend, the youth, led by Samuel Aluda said Mbugua shelved his ambitions in favour of Kamukunji MP Yusuf Hassan. They said President Uhuru Kenyatta asked him to allow Hassan to represent the Northeastern community in Nairobi. “Mbugua complied with the President’s request for the greater good and harmony of Jubilee. He did that out of respect and Hassan won the seat,” Aluda said. Hassan got the Jubilee ticket after Mbugua stepped down following “consultations”. The youth said Jubilee should reward the former MP. They said he was instrumental in the presidential campaigns in the city. “He wooed many young voters to vote for the President, DP William Ruto, Governor Mike Sonko and Senator Johnson Sakaja won,” they said.
