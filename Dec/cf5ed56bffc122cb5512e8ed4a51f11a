A refugee woman who returned to Dadaab refugee camps after voluntary repatriation has vowed never to step to war ravaged Somalia. Jamila Hassan Abdi, a mother of eight, narrated her heartbreaking story to the Star on Friday at Ifo 2 camp where she has called home. She said the October 14 Sobe junction terrorist attack that killed more than 400 people has completely changed her perception towards her country of birth. "I will never go back to Somalia even if all camps are closed. I will stay where there is peace and sounds of explosions are unheard," she said. She said her husband, Ayub Abdullahi Abdi, is completely traumatized following the event of mass killing of Sobe junction when track loaded with explosive went off. Jamila says she has to watch over him because he sometimes wanders out of their home without notice because of the devastating impact. "I stay five houses from where the attack happened, I saw mutilated bodies being taken away from the scene, a memory that has refused to go away. I do not wish to remember the incident," she said, amid sobs. She registered to travel back to Mogadishu on April 2016, a place she had initially fled in 2010 due to civil war, since they were told that security has improved. Jamila, who was assisted to sneak back to the camp early November, claims she is also facing discrimination among refugees. She said she now lives under the mercy of well-wishers since she has not registered fully by the UNHCR. Denis Alma Kuindje, UNHCR's senior protection coordinator at Dadaab sub-office, acknowledged that some refugees who have sneaked back to the camps after voluntary repatriation. He agency is not taking lightly on the return of refugees, adding there are areas with security concerns.
