Garissa Governor Ali Korane yesterday thanked former Governor Nathif Jama for withdrawing an election petition against him. He spoke during Jamhuri Day celebrations. Korane was commenting on the issue for the first time since a deal was struck last week by elders from his clan and those from Nathif’s clan. He welcomed the move, saying it will help unite communities that had been divided along political lines because of the protracted election campaigns. Although Nathif has not come out to publicly deny or acknowledge he had withdrawn the case, elders said they had his blessings during the negotiations. Korane said contrary to what is being peddled on social media that Nathif was under intense pressure to drop the case, he did it in his own wisdom in the interest of the people of Garissa. Korane did not, however, say if he had spoke to Nathif. “I want to make it clear there was no inducement from me or any quarters, nor was there any pressure for Nathif to drop the case,” Korane said. He said after the polarising campaigns that divided residents on political and clan lines, he would strive to bring people together. Korane said next week, he would hold a major conference that will bring together all communities in Garissa. The agenda is promoting peace and co-existence. “We want to focus our energy on bringing residents together irrespective of their political persuasions. “We will bring on board sultans of major clans, elders, women, clerics, the disabled and the youth,” he said.
