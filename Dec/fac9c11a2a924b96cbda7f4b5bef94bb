Tetu MP Gichuhi Mwangi has promised to ensure there will be transparency in CDF bursary fund allocation. He said the fund has been benefitting even
undeserving children in the constituency in the past. Mwangi said thorough scrutiny will be done to ensure only deserving students benefit. “We should adhere to the law and give priority to needy children,” he said. The MP spoke on Wednesday during the prize giving day at Kangaita Primary
School in Tetu. He was accompanied by Nyeri Woman Representative
Rahab Mukami. Mukami said Nyeri leaders have put in place measures to
ensure education is improved in the county. She also advised students not to be misled by others
in schools through peer pressure. “Many students leave secondary schools while disciplined,
but change when they join universities due to peer pressure,” Mukami said. She also advised schools heads to
ensure there is counselling and motivational talk programmes to ensure students
improve. The leaders also promised to improve the school infrastructure
in the area.
