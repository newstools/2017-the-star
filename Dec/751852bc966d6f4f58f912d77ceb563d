Eight people, among them a KDF officer and a policeman, were on Sunday injured after a matatu they were traveling in rolled along the Ol Kalou-Gilgil road. The matatu's tyre burst in the Simba area during the 8pm incident forcing the vehicle to roll. Nyandarua Central police boss Wilson Kosgei yesterday said the accident could also have been caused by speeding. "The tyre that burst was clearly worn-out. The vehicle must have lacked service for sometime," Kosgei said. Four people were seriously injured. They are fighting for their lives at the Kijabe Mission Hospital. Kosgei attributed the injuries to lack of seat belts. He asked the National Transport and Safety Authority to enhance vehicle inspection.  â€œPassengers should also be responsible for their safety while traveling. If the seat belts had been fastened, the injuries would have been minimal," Kosgei said. He said avoidable errors committed by the driver could not be ruled out. "Investigations will reveal more," Kosgei said. The matatu, belonging to MML sacco, had its number plate smeared with mud. Police read mischief in the act.
