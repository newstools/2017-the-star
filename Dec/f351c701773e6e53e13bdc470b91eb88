An agent of Embakasi East MP Babu Owino has defended him against accusations that he assaulted his opponent Joshua Obiende. Dancun Odundo told justice Joseph Sergon he was at the tallying centre and did not see any violence. Returning officer Nicholas Butuk told the court he did not see Babu rearranging ballot boxes at the tallying centre. On Tuesday, he said his mandate was to receive results from presiding officers working under him, announce and declare the same from polling centres. He did not make any changes in the results. Butuk said Babu became impatient when he misplaced a form, but announced him as the winner. â€œDuring the final stage of the tallying, I realised that Form 35c, which is used to declare the winner, was missing. I had to look for it, however, Babu Owino got impatient and went crazy. Butuk said he noted an error in the final tally, which was a result of wrong tallying.
