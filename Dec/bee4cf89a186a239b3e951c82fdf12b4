Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) Championship leaders Menengai Oilers travel to face hosts Kisumu today at Mamboleo Showground, hoping to continue with their impressive run. Oilers have so far won their two matches while Kisumu have won one and lost one. The Nakuru-based side lead the log with 10 points after two bonus points wins.  Oilers beat Moi University’s Arsonists 63-14 at Nakuru Showground on Saturday.  Kisumu team manager Shellan Nyaera said: “We expect a tough match. Oilers are a very good team but we are targeting a win. We want to end their unbeaten run.” Oilers will be without Sam Muregi, who will make his debut in the World Rugby Series in Cape Town this weekend. However, Oilers coach Gibson Weru said the two will not be missed.  “We have a big squad. We have built on our depth and we keep rotating our players to give everyone a chance. For example, we made 10 changes from the team which played our first match,” said Weru.  On their game against Kisumu, Weru said: “We want to maintain our consistency and keep improving. Our aim is to develop players so that when we get to Kenya Cup, we have players whose game awareness is high.”  Second-placed former Kenya Cup side Mean Machine visit newly promoted Ngong RFC at Kibiku secondary school grounds.
