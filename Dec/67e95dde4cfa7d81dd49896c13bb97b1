About 150 farmers in Kwale county will adopt commercial farming, instead of subsistence, to boost food security. This comes after the county Agriculture department partnered with the Food and Agriculture Organization to implement a project that is meant to boost production. Increasing small holder productivity and profitability through good practices will have farmers use improved planting technologies and seeds. The project will sustain crop yields, saving production resources, maintaining or improving soil fertility and conserving water and the environment to attain sustainable output Agriculture director David Wanjala on Wednesday said farmers from Matuga, Msambweni and Lunga Lunga subcounties have already received seeds, fertiliser, animal-drawn implements and tractors to start implementing the project. “We’ve issued farmers under the project with necessary technical support to do farming. In a year’s time, we hope the project will start bearing fruit,” he said. Wanjala said the project started in 2015 and is expected to run until June 1, next year.
