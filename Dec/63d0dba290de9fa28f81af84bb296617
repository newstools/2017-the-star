Fredrick Omondi Oduor went against all odds to emerge top KCSE candidate in Kakamega county with an aggregate A plain. Omondi of Kakamega high school got an A minus in English, A in Kiswahili, A in Mathematics, A in Geography, A in Physics, A in Chemistry, B in Biology, B+ in Christian Religious Education and A- (minus) in Business Studies. The soft spoken boy said he will study medicine in order to give back to the community which was very handy for him in time of need. Omondi was brought up by a single parent Celina Awino after his father died while he was in class two. Celina, a peasant farmer, said she did not rest until after her son was admitted in Kakamega High school - hailed as one of the best schools in western. "My Mother did everything to make sure I got the best education. I want to appreciate her very much. Were it not for her, I wouldn't have even joined high school." "I promise that I wont let her down. Her tears will be over soon," Omondi said. He added that he got all the support he needed at the school thanking all the teachers and the principal Oliver Minishi who understood her situation and kept him in school throughout. Principal Oliver Minishi said he was so impressed with this years' results adding that the school didn't have any A last year. "We are happy about this class of 2017. They have worked very hard to give us very impressive results. Next year, we are hoping that it will be even better than this year."   Read: Girls top KCSE as 90 per cent fail to qualify for university Related: Sing’ore Girls' star performance is in honour of Bishop Korir - principal Click here for latest political news
