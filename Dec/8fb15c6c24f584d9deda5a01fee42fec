Kenya is
rated as a powerhouse in the region for its high human resource, and our
representatives must reflect our standing. Anything we take part in or are called
to must expose us to be the best and excel, just as we do in sports. We must
take the leadership of East Africa politically at this critical point in the
East African Community. The East
African Legislative Assembly is a strategic institution for horse-trading,
legislation, and is where our national interests must be safeguarded. But we
cannot do so if our processes or nominations are compromised by vested, or
partisan, political interests and nepotism. Regrettably,
the situation we are in, given the absence of Kenya in the last sitting,
because of the failure of the last Parliament and attempts to bend the law, we
have become a laughing stock. Our protracted political battles have put the
national interest at risk. The law
as it is on nominations should be changed. It is heavily biased against
independent applicants.
