Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho, alias 001, is known for his unique fashion sense. When it comes to fashion, he is always on top. From designer sunglasses, caps, clothes and shoes, worst-dressed politicians should borrow a leaf from Joho. Well, the Mombasa county boss was recently spotted rocking Louis Vuitton run away sneakers in a mix of Monogram canvas, technical lining and a rubber hand-crafted outsole worth Sh92,000. That's your salary for three months if you're earning Sh30,000 per month or your nine months' rent if you are paying Sh10,000 a month.
