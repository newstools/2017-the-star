There has been an increase in gender-based violence in Migori during this festive season. Migori county police commander Joseph Nthenge said there are increased cases of sexual assault. “Most cases are reported in Migori town. Several defilement and assault cases have been recorded compared to other areas in the county,” he said. Nthenge appealed to lobby groups to help bring the culprits to book, adding that most victims are afraid to report the matter to police.  He spoke to the Star on Wednesday after a family in Milimani estate complained of police  laxityin arresting a suspect identified as Patrick, whom they accused of being a serial sex offender.  But Nthenge said the man has been arrested and police are investigating.
