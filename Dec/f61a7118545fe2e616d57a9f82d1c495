Uasin Gishu has adopted a mobile money payment system for parking fees following the theft of Sh5 million by revenue collection staff. Two weeks ago, some 42 employees in the revenue department were suspended for allegedly diverting parking fees they collected to their pockets. Parking charges will now be paid through M-Pesa to seal loopholes often blamed for revenue loss. ICT executive Emily Kogos was leading a team inducting motorists about the use of the new system. “This plan offers parking rights to only those who have paid,” Kogos said on Tuesday. Kogos said investigations were ongoing to reveal details of the theft believed to have occurred in the four months from July. The suspects allegedly presented fake banking slips to the county, claiming to have deposited the parking fees collected. Chief finance office Peter Chesos confirmed the officers were sent home to facilitate investigations into the theft. “The workers were given letters and asked to show why they should not be disciplined over the financial malpractices,” Chesos said.
