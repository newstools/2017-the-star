Mt Kenya University has condemned the Kiambu county assembly for passing a motion that makes it mandatory for companies and institutions to employ 70 per cent of residents. The assembly passed the motion on Thursday. Founder and chairman Prof Simon Gicharu on Friday said the motion is ill-advised and a hindrance to the pursuit of national integration. The assembly should have come up with policies that will improve national integration and cohesion among locals and non-locals, he said. “The motion will only hold us back from achieving what we have been struggling to achieve – national integration. Our leaders must be careful and mindful of the upshots of the motions and policies they pass,” Gicharu said. Leaders should work together to end stereotypes. Gicharu told the university’s employees the motion will not affect them. “We are lucky to have a President who strives to unite the country and bridge gaps among communities and regions. Our leaders should back him,” Gicharu said. Read:Kiambu MCAs pass motion compelling firms, institutions to hire 70 per cent locals Click here for latest political news
