The matatu, belonging to Namukika Sacco, was ferrying passengers from Kiria-ini town to Murang’a town, when its brakes failed when going down a hill. Residents watched helplessly as matatu driver Peter Kimani struggled to control the vehicle while avoiding to hit people on the streets. The matatu hita saloon car that was joining the street from parking, hurting two adults and an infant that were in the car. It finally stopped after mechanics put stones on the road at the end of the street, forcing it to come to a halt. Mechanic Michael Maina appealed to the county government to divert the road from Kiria-ini town through the Murang’a Mortuary Road.
