Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong took the witness stand in Busia High Court on Wednesday in a petition by ex-Teso South MP Mary Emaase against MP Geoffrey Omuse. Ojaamong, one of the three witnesses lined up by Omuse, was in the dock for at least 40 minutes. Both lawyers for Emaase, Omuse and the IEBC will now give their final submissions on January 8 before justice Kiarie Waweru fixes a judgment date. He will deliver a ruling on an application for recount and scrutiny of votes on the same date. While being cross-examined by Emaase’s lawyer Evans Ondieki Ojaamong denied he used his influence to have Omuse declared winner by ‘manipulating’ results at Amukura.
