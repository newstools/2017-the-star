Shujaa head coach Innocent Simiyu believes his side must improve on various aspects of the game if they are to leave a mark in the remaining World Sevens Series, starting with Sydney Sevens next month. Kenya face Argentina, France and Wales in Pool ‘B’ and Simiyu said they will prioritise skill and condition in their training for the next one month. “There are little areas in our game that we need to tighten to ensure we finish games strongly and be in a position to challenge for the Main Cup,” said Simiyu. One area of concern for the tactician is skill execution and mental strength. “A good example is the France game, where we led 14-7 but could not close out the game and win. If you look at our performances against New Zealand and Australia in Dubai, we were dominant but could not convert possession into points. It’s something we will address in training in the next couple of weeks,” added Simiyu. He was, however, pleased with the overall performances which saw Kenya sit 11th with 13 points after two rounds. “The two tournaments were challenging but we’re quite impressed with how the players performed. However, there are a couple of areas that need fine-tuning,” said Simiyu. He observed that the new players will have to adapt quickly. “We need to get more players exposed to the pressure on how to manage the game in that critical time,” added Simiyu. Elsewhere, Resolution Insurance have renewed their sponsorship to Impala Saracens to the tune of Sh15million. Resolution Insurance said the sponsorship will see the team benefit from medical insurance, training and game allowances for players on match day squads, winning bonuses, pre/post training, meals and direct payment of stipends to the team management. The sponsorship renewal will see Resolution Insurance remain headline sponsor of the team as it has been for the past 10 years with annual sponsorship renewals throughout the time period.
