Opposition leader Raila Odinga has told foreign envoys that he is ready to face treason charges if that is what it requires to achieve justice. He said unless President Uhuru Kenyatta reaches out to him in person, he will go ahead with his swearing-in ceremony next Tuesday. "Let them charge me for treason. I am ready," he told envoys led by US ambassador Robert Godec on Friday. The NASA leader met with them a day after telling the US off for interfering with Kenya's affairs. He told the US on Thursday that the country and its citizens can solve their own problems and need not be told to abide by the constitution.

"I stress the need to uphold the constitution. We urge the government, Opposition and all Kenyans to engage in open, transparent national conversation," he said. Raila has refused to recognise Uhuru as president and made the coalition a resistance outfit. He has so far called for a boycott of products linked to the Jubilee administration after the October 26 repeat election. Attorney General Githu Muigai has warned that treason is punishable by death. "High treason" is what Muigai used earlier on Thursday to refer to moves for a parallel government. “The criminal law of the Republic of Kenya, in Article 40 of the penal code provides or stipulates that that sort of process, is high treason,” he noted.
