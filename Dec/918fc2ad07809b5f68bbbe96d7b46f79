The ruling yesterday by the Supreme Court that the mandatory death sentence is unconstitutional should be commended (see P6). The mandatory sentence applies to such cases as robbery with violence, murder and treason. The death penalty is controversial and its supporters and opponents are locked in massive disagreements that will not be resolved any time soon, if ever. The Court found that the "trial process does not stop at convicting the accused person" and includes "sentencing" before which submissions are heard and a judge decides. Depriving a judge of discretion by making a sentence mandatory would therefore occasion injustice. The mandatory sentence is an extreme punishment and judges should consider all extenuating circumstances. Sentencing should depend on the severity of the offence committed and what the law prescribes as punishment. Removal of the sentence will give judges much more room to be careful and to deliver justice and not to automatically put people to death.
