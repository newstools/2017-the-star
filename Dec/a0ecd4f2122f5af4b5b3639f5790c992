Read: Three cops injured after al Shabaab attack buses in Lamu More officers were deployed on Saturday early morning to pursue the attackers. On November 28, three police officers sustained serious injuries after a convoy of buses they were escorting was attacked by al Shabaab in Lamu. The militants shot at the five vehicles, which were heading from Lamu to Mombasa, from a bush at Lango la Simba area on the Witu-Garsen highway.  "The suspected militants emerged from the bushes and began shooting randomly at the escort vehicle. Three of us were shot," an officer who was part of the team said. Passengers in the two Tawakal, Tahmeed, Simba, and Mombasa Raha buses said the heavily armed attackers wore full combat and waved al Shabaab flags. They said the militants, who numbered to more than 50, forcefully entered buses and distributed propaganda leaflets with the message: "We wont retreat. Our target is the government."   Click here for the latest political news
