 Acting Public Works PS Paul Maringa (pictured) has urged youths in Lamu equip themselves with skills and seek employment once the port under the Lapsset project starts operation. He urged them not to be lazy and told parents and guardians to guide their children. Speaking when he led a delegation from the Lapsset board on a tour of the port site in Kililana at the weekend, Maringa said only those with the required skills will get jobs. He said most projects are at the infant stage and this gives parents ample time to send their children to school so they are ready to take up jobs. Maringa said Lamu stands to benefit from the Lapsset project in Kililana as well as the Sh200 billion coal-fired power plant, the proposed Sh21 billion wind harnessing project in Baharini and the ongoing oil and gas exploration project on Pate Island by the Zarara firm in Lamu East. He said thousands of youths could be employed. Maringa said, “The Lapsset project is huge and has the ability to employ thousands. As for me, I would recommend 70 per cent of the jobs be given to the Lamu youth, but first they should be armed with the required skills. I am aware the problem with most of the local youths here is laziness. People are not willing to take on hard tasks and chores here at the Lapsset. I advise the youth and even the parents to be educated well enough to take the jobs.”  Lapsset Corridor Development Authority chairman Francis Muthaura said it would be unwise for parents to claim their children have not been employed if they do not equip them with the necessary education and skills. He said education is the key to end poverty.
