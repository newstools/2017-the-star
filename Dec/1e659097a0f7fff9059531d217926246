Zari is still pissed at
Diamond for taking her love for granted by getting Hamisa pregnant. Speaking to Sanyu FM, the mother of five said: "Diamond
is on probation and is managing well so far. I can even date 100 men
because I love being loved, even if I leave Diamond today, I will date
someone else tomorrow." Zari called out her husband for his carelessness. "Why
cheat with a low life? Why cheat from my bed? Why not wear a condom?
Diamond is still fighting to live up to my standards," she said. Zari is currently preparing for her all-white party that is set to take place on December 21.
