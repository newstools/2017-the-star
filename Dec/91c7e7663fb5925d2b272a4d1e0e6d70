Kilifi plans to upgrade Malindi sub-county hospital to ease congestion and improve services from 2018. Governor Amason Kingi said key projects include building two modern wards so there is enough space to admit patients. Kingi added on Monday that the county was looking for
radiologists to operate machines at the facility.  Speaking after visiting patients on Christmas Day, he said the posts were advertised so they can stop hiring experts from other areas. “We have been forced to take some of our officers for specialised radiology training so as to bring services closer to the people. We are
still waiting for applications." The Governor further said the the construction of a new mortuary had neared completion. During the visit, Kingi distributed milk, biscuits and pampers to patients in the pediatric wing. Some patients in other wards confronted him, saying services had been delayed and that they had been forced to pay for medicine the hospital did not have. Others complained of lack of services and poor maintenance of some wards. Kingi said the hospital needed streamlining for proper service delivery. Regarding cleaning, he said a private company had been contracted but that locals took over but were doing a poor job. “We may be forced to give the job to a private company
because locals are failing us. They normally ask for jobs but cannot meet standards." The Governor said plans were underway for a drugs storage centre so there is enough for all patients. Click here for the latest political stories
