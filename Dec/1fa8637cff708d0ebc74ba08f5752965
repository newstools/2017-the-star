About 40 per cent of the beneficiaries of top state honours came from President Uhuru Kenyatta’s Central Kenya backyard. Those loyal to Jubilee seemed to dominate the list. Twenty-four of the 59 civilians who won the Head of State Commendation were all from one ethnic community, raising concerns on the criteria used to identify top achievers. NCIC chairman Francis Kaparo was unavailable for comment on the composition of the list. The HSC is a coveted honour conferred by the President to individuals for their exemplary achievements and are highly regarded as prestigious and distinguished. However, Tuesday’s beneficiaries have triggered an uproar, with Kenyans pouring cold water on the list that left out distinguished Kenyans who have excelled in different fields. On the spot are state honours advisory committees, which have been accused of doctoring the final lists and substituting names with those not initially submitted. The National Honours Act, 2013 provides the procedure and mechanism for conferring national honours. An awardee should be a person who has brought honour, glory or pride to the republic. “A person shall merit the conferment of a national honour if the person is a person who exhibited or exhibits exemplary qualities, actions or achievements of heroism, sacrifice, bravery, patriotism or leadership for the defence, benefit or betterment of the country or a county,” reads Section 4 (a) of the Act. Others who can be conferred the honours include those who have made exemplary contributions to the country or a county in the economic, social, scientific, academic, public administration, governance, sports, journalism, business, security or other fields.
