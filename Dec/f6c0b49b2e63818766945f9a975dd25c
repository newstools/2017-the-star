Laikipia Woman Representative Catherine Waruguru has defended her polygamous marriage, saying she is comfortable being the second wife. Waruguru congratulated President Uhuru kenyatta for signing into law the Marriage Act on Wednesday last week. Addressing a women’s conference in Nanyuki town on Saturday, the former nominated MCA at the Laikipia assembly said she had no apologies to make. “You saw the President signing into law the Marriage Act the other day. As women, we must refrain from being distracted by societal decisions,” the legislator said. Waruguru is married to Nanyuki-based lawyer Kiprotich Kiget. The mother of two said it was her decision to move in with the lawyer. A statement from the presidency confirmed that the Bill, which it said “consolidates various laws relating to marriage”, had been signed into law. The Bill, which amended existing legislation, was passed by Parliament last month to formalise traditional practice regarding marrying more than one person. “Marriage is the voluntary union of a man and a woman, whether in a monogamous or polygamous union,” the presidential statement added. The initial bill had given a wife the right to veto the husband’s choice, but men Members of Parliament overcame party divisions to push through a text that dropped this clause. Waruguru faulted the county assembly for failing to nominate a person living with disability.
