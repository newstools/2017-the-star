They have threatened to hold demonstrations if he is reappointed. The elders said the CS has been ineffective. Addressing journalists on Tuesday at Nchiru shrine, chairman Linus Kathera and secretary general  Josphat Murangiri said Kaimenyi has nothing to show for his time at the Education docket. The elders accused him of causing divisions in the council by supporting a splinter group led by Paul M’ithinkia and secretary general Phares Rutere. They declared the two outcasts. The Njuri Ncheke has cursed the CS twice. The first time was in May 2015 after he failed to honour summons over comments he made about the elders.  He paid a fine of a white, spotless bull and Sh100,000 in July that year. The curse was lifted. In May this year, Kaimenyi was in trouble with the elders again. They  placed a curse known as ‘Mirongo ithatu’ against him, accusing him of fuelling divisions among them. The elders said there are qualified people from Meru and Tharaka Nithi whom the President can appoint in his place.    Rutere They said no one should dictate to Uhuru because he knows the people who have performed well. The Rutere group on Monday urged Uhuru to retain Kaimenyi, saying he has done a good job. Rutere urged the President to reserve another CS post and Principal Secretary position for someone from the community. He said Kaimenyi did a sterling job in the Education ministry before he moved to Lands. “He has brought a lot of reforms. Getting title deeds has become easy,” Rutere said. “Kaimenyi created a good working relationship between the ministry and the National Land Commission.”  Rutere also praised the CS for getting rid of cartels by disbanding land boards. But Murangiri said Rutere is an illegitimate leader, who should not speak on behalf of Njuri Ncheke.
