Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala has urged ANC members to remain calm and stick with NASA, despite differences concerning the distribution of leadership positions at the National Assembly. He said the wrangles are unfounded and are being propelled by those with selfish ambitions. Malala addressed the press in Kakamega on Wednesday. ODM has been accused of sidelining partners ANC, Wiper and Ford K. “We have had several complaints that ODM party has been bullying the affiliate parties, but I would like to tell our people that it’s important to strengthen our party by electing many leaders in our own party so that we can get many elective leadership positions in Parliament,” Malala said. He said ODM has the numbers and was justified to win seats.
