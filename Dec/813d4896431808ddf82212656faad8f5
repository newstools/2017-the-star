A remote village in Mwingi was stirred last Saturday after a flamboyant city businessman accompanied by several MPs arrived in four choppers to pay dowry for his bride.  Nairobi businessman Henry Waswa shocked the sleepy Nzatani village in Kitui county, after landing in style to pay bride price for Moreen Tabitha. A fleet of high-end vehicles was on standby to pick the guests.  The groom, from Bungoma county, was accompanied by youthful legislators, led by area MP Charles Nguna (Mwingi West), Babu Owino (Embakasi East), Caleb Amisi (Saboti) and Alfred Keter (Nandi Hills).  Waswa was in the news last year after he offered a free air ticket to Saleh Wanjala, aka Bungoma's 'James Bond', who hit the headlines after hanging on a helicopter in Bungoma carrying the body of Jacob Juma. The trader, who has interests in the entertainment and real estate industry, hosted Saleh and his family to a luncheon at his home in Lavington. And true to his philanthropic spirit, Waswa, who donned West African regalia and flashy ornaments on Saturday, threw a whole night party for the villagers. All hotels and guest rooms in Kitui on the day he was in town were fully occupied by his guests. According to a budget of the event seen by the Nairobian, Sh5 million was spent on the event, with a ring the couple exchanged costing a whopping Sh1.6 million.  Details are scanty as to how much bride price was paid, though the heavy presence of security could be a pointer that a hefty amount of money exchanged hands. The lovebirds are said to have been flown to an unknown destination outside the country for the main wedding.
