Family Bank has approached the DPP for an out-of-court settlement in a Sh1.6 billion case against its eight senior managers. The case relates to alleged money laundering involving the prime suspect in the NYS scam, Josephine Kabura, a trial court has been told. When the matter came up for hearing yesterday, defence lawyer Cecil Miller representing the bank told Milimani chief magistrate Francis Andayi they have officially written a proposal for an out-of-court deal to the DPP. “We have initiated talks with the DPP to explore an out-of-court settlement which may bring the matter to an end,” Miller said.  The prosecution informed the court they have not received the alleged proposal letter and they were ready to proceed with the hearing. Besides approaching the DPP, the bank has filed an application at the Court of Appeal to have the criminal case quashed. It says the case amounts to double jeopardy to the bank since it has been black listed by the CBK. Miller said they are not ready to proceed with the case since he is engaged in a petition involving Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko before the High Court. However, the magistrate allowed the defence application for adjournment and fixed the case to be heard on March 15,and to confirm the DPP’s decision on the out-of-court settlement proposal.  The accused are Family Bank chief executive John King’ori and former CEO Peter Munyiri are charged alongside KTDA branch manager Robert Nyaga, Anti-money compliance manager Charles Thiongo, Head of Risk and Compliance Raphael Ndunda, Operations Supervisor Nancy Njambi, Relationship Platinum manager Meldon Onyango and Customer Service supervisor Josephine Wairi.  They are charged with failure to report significant transactions carried out by Kabura’s three accounts at the bank. All the accused person have denied the charges and are all out on a Sh1 million bond. The charge sheet says bank officials knew about the suspect dealings in Kabura’s accounts and failed to report it.
