The county government is set to take legal measures on advertising firms defying city by-laws. Advertising firms risk being blacklisted for disregarding the county by -laws on erection of billboards. Acting county director for Urban design, outdoor advertisement and public space management Patrick Akivaga said some billboards are put up illegally without their consent. Akivanga told the Star some the billboards are erected without their approval, and that the companies might be blacklisted as a result of disobeying city by-laws "The draft Nairobi City County Outdoor Advertising and Signage Control and Regulation Bill, which was passed and signed in 2014, states a minimum distance of 100m must be maintained between advertising signs or advertisements on the same side of a public street, including any motorway," Akivaga said. "Some of these companies put up the adverts during the night. Also, knowing the county government does not operate during the weekend, they take advantage and put their adverts," he said. On Monday, the county pulled down some of the billboards, which were erected illegally in Westlands and Lavington areas. "The billboards were pulled down were put up against our content which means the adverting firms did not follow the right procedure in order," Akivaga said. The acting director urged adverting firms to consider ethics while erecting bill boards, saying some of the content was immoral and unethical. "We had to recently pull down a billboard which contained an advert on condoms. The language used was indecent, and was not good advice to our children who are still in school," he said. Patrick urged the advertising firms to be sensitive to the type of content used in the adverts. Content regulation is however not done by City Government but it is regulated by the Kenya Film Classic Board.
