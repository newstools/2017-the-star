Ngong police released the 26 herders they arrested on Saturday on claims they trespassed on government land with their livestock. This is after politicians intervened. “We released them after they assured us they will not put up structures on government land and graze on it. The same was also confirmed by their elected leaders that the herders must respect private property,” a senior police officer told the Star yesterday. The 26 Maasai herders, among them two minors, were rounded up on Ngong land used by the veterinary department for research on livestock. Saturday’s arrest was one of the many police had carried out on herders who illegally graze livestock on the 1,850 acre-land belonging to the government. Kajiado Senator Philip Mpaayie said he had to intervene.
