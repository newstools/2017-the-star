Environmental conservationists are worried that reclamation at Makupa Creek and the Kibarani dumpsite will destroy marine life. On Monday, they said the reclamation by big logistics and transport companies does not meet international standards. “We have not seen the Environment Assessment Impact reports by these companies before the construction and reclamation was done,” Bosco Juma said. He is a director at Big Ship, a community based organisation in Mombasa. Juma said the companies that have reclaimed part of the ocean at the Makupa causeway did not care about marine life. Big Ship has released an 18-page report on the degradation of mangrove forests in Mombasa, especially in the Makupa and Tudor creeks. Ibrahim Hassan said the dumpsite is an eye-sore and a health hazard. The garbage dumped in the ocean has depleted fish yields, threatening the livelihoods of 50 fishermen who depend on Makupa Creek. Juma said there is need to balance the development of infrastructure and environment conservation for future generations. Click here for the latest political news
