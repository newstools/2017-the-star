NASA has written to 10 counties that have approved the People's Assembly motion requesting a venue for leader Raila Odinga's inauguration. Raila has carried on with his push for electoral and other reforms and is now the leader of a national resistance movement. He announced he will be sworn-in on December 12 while President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William were being inaugurated at Kasarani stadium on November 28. The idea has been opposed and termed treasonable but the Opposition has sent invitation cards. It said the venue will be communicated after attendees are vetted.
