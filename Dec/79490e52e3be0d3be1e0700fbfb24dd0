National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi was yesterday forced to suspended the motion on the constitution of the Parliamentary Service Commission. The speaker made the decision after MPs from both Jubilee and NASA raised concerns on the proposed nominees and the criteria used to pick them. The legislators opposed the list immediately Majority leader Aden Duale stood to move the motion for the approval of seven MPs to the commission. Jubilee has nominated Senator Beth Mugo, Kericho Senator Aaron Cheruiyot, MPs Adan Keynan (Eldas) and Naomi Shaban (Taveta), while NASA has nominated Gladys Wanga (Homa Bay), Aisha Jumwa (Malindi) and Vihiga Senator George Khaniri. Read:Standoffs in Jubilee and NASA as MPs differ on PSC nominees Kangema MP Muturi Kigano (JP) kicked off the storm after he questioned the constitutionality of the list. Kigano, who interrupted Duale with a point of order, argued that the NASA list was in violation of the Article 127 ( 2 ) of the Constitution. “This motion smacks of an unconstitutionality. Wiper is a parliamentary party, and, according to the Constitution, being a party not forming the government, it has a right to have a nominee to the PSC. The whole of this appointment stands vitiated,” he said, amid cheers from Wiper members. Kigano told the House that considering Wiper commands more than five per cent, it had been denied its constitutional right to have a nominee in the PSC, a point that was supported by Borabu MP Ben Momanyi. Momanyi said there was no consultation among NASA affiliate parties before the list was brought to the House. Jubilee MPs also had issues with the names. When Muturi read out the names of Mugo, Keynan and Wanga, the MPs shouted “No”. The three legislators served in the commission in the last Parliament.
