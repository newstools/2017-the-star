Nakuru Town West MP Samuel Arama has denied allegations of voter bribery and electricity outage during the August 8 election. Testifying before Justice Mumbi Ngugi, Arama said he won fairly and did not bribe voters nor switch off electricity at the constituency tallying centre as alleged by ODM aspirant Isoke Ochoki. "My agents were sending me text messages of the results from all centres," he said. The Nakuru legislator also told the court the allegations that he and Nakuru West subcounty administrator gave voters money in the August 8 morning "are lies generated by the loser". Ochoki filed a petition at the High Court, challenging the election of Arama. In his application, he says the electoral process was marred with irregularities and inconsistencies in favour of Arama. He wants the court to order scrutiny and recount of votes cast in Nakuru Town West. Ochoki also wants the court to declare him the winner if he is found to have garnered more votes. Arama garnered 29,682 votes against Ochoki’s 25,071.
