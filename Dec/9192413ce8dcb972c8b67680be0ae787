The grapevine is rife with news of a new celebrity baby. Our sources who are close, like thisclose, to J Blessing and Avril whispered that the two are expecting a beautiful bundle of joy early next year. "Dude, here is a scoop," the source said, "Avril is paged with J Blessing. She is paged daddy. 100%." Another source added, "Yes, Avril is expecting her first child and she is keeping everything hush hush because this matter is private and she wants it to stay out of the limelight." Commenting about the matter, J Blessing flat out denied the allegations, saying, "But for real, it is news to me as well." Adding with a threat, "I cannot get into that because I will file a case for defamation immediately they mention me without any facts because I'm sure of my position."  Avril was more demure about the topic, saying, "I'm immune to controversy." Adding that she will not fuel the fire of the rumour because society and the industry have "double standards" when it comes to women. However entertainment pundits claim that if this news is true than Avril, being the music power that she is, is most likely to bag huge endorsements during and after her pregnancy. She will join other celebrity mums who have cashed in big like Size 8, Janet Mbugua and DJ Pierra Makena.
