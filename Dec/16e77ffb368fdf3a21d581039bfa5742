ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi has been given 24 hours to apologise to the Bukusu or risk the wrath of rowdy crowds should he set foot in Bungoma and Trans Nzoia counties. Two Jubilee MPs from Bungoma and a section of MCAs from the county have accused Mudavadi of orchestrating the heckling of Water CS Eugene Wamalwa in Vihiga on Tuesday. Wamalwa was forced to flee after rowdy youths chased him away from a Maragoli festival in Mbale. Mudavadi presided over the ceremony. Addressing the press on Wednesday at Satellite Hotel in Webuye, MPs John Waluke (Sirisia) and Mwambu Mabonga (Bumula) said Wamalwa’s heckling was planned to portray him as a rejected leader in Western. “The heckling was an act of shame and cowardice,” Waluke said. Mudavadi belongs to the Maragoli subtribe of the Luhya while Wamalwa is a Bukusu.  Bukusus are mainly found in Bungoma and Trans Nzoia counties. Residents and analysts said the two subtribes have had a long history of rivalry between them. The MPs’ demands could stoke new hatred. “We never expected a leader of Mudavadi’s reputation to do the things we saw. Classifying Luhyas as Maragolis, Tirikis and Bukusus has denied us progress for a long time,” Waluke said. “As Jubilee leaders, we want Mudavadi to apologise or he is not going to set foot in Bungoma and Trans Nzoia.”  Waluke said he will avenge the heckling of Wamalwa if Mudavadi fails to offer a public apology. Mwambu said the heckling was uncalled for.
