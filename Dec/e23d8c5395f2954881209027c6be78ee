The opposition was working behind the scenes to cause chaos during the August 8 and October 26 elections, a senior government official has said.  Interior PS Karanja Kibicho said it is only through the grace of God that the country has remained united. He urged Kenyans to view each other as equals and move on. “Elections come and go, but Kenya and its people remain. Let us come together as we dialogue on common issues and take this country to the next level,” Kibicho said. Karanja spoke at the Kibiru Anglican Church in Kirinyaga county on Friday. He said time for politics is long gone.  “Immediately President Uhuru Kenyatta was sworn in last Tuesday, this brought to an end the many months of politicking. Now that period is behind us. We must embark on serious nation-building to recover the time we lost,” Kibicho said. Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru said those who have started planning for the 2022 election should give her space to deliver on the promises she made to residents. “The dust is yet to settle after the gruelling electioneering period and we must now start working for the people,” she said.
