Minority leader John Mbadi (pictured) was yesterday ejected from Parliament for failing to withdraw a remark he made that Kenya has no President. Speaker Justin Muturi ordered Mbadi to withdraw the remark, but the Suba South MP remained adamant. Read:John Mbadi ejected from Parliament after 'Kenya has no president' remark “There is no President in this country to make appointments. I would rather withdraw from the Chamber than withdraw the remark,” he said. Muturi then ordered Mbadi out of the Chamber, saying he “will not allow politics to come to play in the House”. “I will not allow that on my watch,” he added. Mbadi stood on a point of order to oppose a motion by Majority leader Aden Duale to approve a procedural change on how the speaker should communicate in case President Uhuru Kenyatta submits Cabinet nominees to Parliament. The motion that was finally approved by the House states if the President will communicate to Parliament on the nominees to the Cabinet and the Principal Secretaries among other state officers, Muturi should refer the matter directly to the Committee on Appointments, instead of calling a special sitting. “Notwithstanding the provisions of Standing Order 42 relating to the reading and relaying of messages from the President, and in furtherance to provisions of Articles 152 (2) and 156 (2) of the Constitution, this House resolves that during the period before commencement of the second session... the speaker shall forthwith refer the messages communicating the names to the relevant committee for consideration,” Duale said.
