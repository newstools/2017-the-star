After missing on promotion to the Kenyan Premier League, Ushuru head coach Ken Kenyatta will embark on a strengthening project in a move aimed at clinching one of the two automatic promotion places come the new season. Ushuru blew their chance to rejoin the top flight after suffering a 2-1 defeat to Thika United in the promotion playoff and their head coach highlighted three areas to bolster ahead of the February 18 National Super League kick off. Kenyatta believes a leftback, an experienced holding midfielder and an extra gloveman will be all that he needs to increase his chances of playing top tier football next season. “It was a great season for us. We had strengths and weaknesses. I need to bring in a left back, a holding midfielder and a goalkeeper to beef up for the upcoming season. The National Super League is tough and we need depth and quality in the side,” said Kenyatta. Kenyatta will however face an uphill task of keeping his two priced stars, Nelson Marasowe and Benson Amianda, who are hotly sought by Kenyan Premier League clubs with Thika United reportedly on their radar. The tactician believes the two will extend their stay with the former KPL side despite approaches from other clubs. “The two have contracts with us and I believe they will stay. Letting them go will jeopardize my plans of strengthening my playing unit.” Ushuru will kick off their 2018 campaign against Administration Police at Camp Toyoyo.
