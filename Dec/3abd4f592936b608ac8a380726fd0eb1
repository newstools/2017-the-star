Lamu residents have been asked to adopt the Nyumba Kumi initiative as a way of combating terrorism, crime and drug use. County commissioner Gilbert Kitiyo yesterday said the initiative is the easiest and surest way of identifying terrorists and other suspicious characters. “Nyumba Kumi works if well executed. It has the ability to end crimes and sweep away any terror elements," Kitiyo said. He was speaking to the Star in his office. Kitiyo asked residents in villages to get to know their neighbours, saying some people could be unknowingly hosting criminals. He attributed the recent security raids that led to the arrest of 30 drug dealers in Lamu to the Nyumba Kumi initiative. "Members of the public raised the alarm and gave police tips," Kitiyo said. "We are urging hotels and restaurant owners to know their customers because terrorists can easily hide in such places," he added. The Nyumba Kumi initiative was launched by the national government in October 2013, to encourage Kenyans to know their neighbours and help identify criminals hiding among them.   suspicious persons in their midst. easily pick out any peculiar persons or situations that could pose a risk to the security of a given place. It was also to flush out criminals hiding amongst unsuspecting members of the public. Ends…photos attached
