The formation of a new vigilante group in Naivasha consisting of pupils and secondary school students has sparked outrage in the town. The group has been linked with robberies and bullying. Parents and community leaders want swift action against those behind it. The group, identified as Maundu, is active in Karati and Naivasha East. Its members do not wear belts and do not tie shoe laces. This emerged during a Nyumba Kumi meeting organised by Jamii Thibiti organisation at AIC Hall. The meeting was attended by local leaders. Naivasha subcounty commissioner Isaac Masinde, who chaired the meeting, said they are searching for the group’s leaders. He told parents to work with the police and warned that those luring teenagers into the gang will face the full force of the law. “We managed to deal with other vigilante groups like Mungiki. I can assure you we’ll equally deal with this emerging group,” Masinde said. Meanwhile, police were investigating cases of drug abuse among area youths. They have told chiefs and their assistants to be on the lookout for drug peddlers.
