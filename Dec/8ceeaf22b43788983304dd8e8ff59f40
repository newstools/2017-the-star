 Embakasi West MP George Theuri, wants the issue of land grabbing in Mowlem ward to be investigate. Speaking in the National Assembly on Thursday, Theuri said residents have been residing on the same parcel of land since 1990. "The same land last year was allocated to a group refered to as Kiambu Dandora group.The group claims to have title deeds land," he said. He said in the past, petitioners have lost their property due to conflicting orders issued by the National Land Commission and courts. Efforts to resolve this matter with relevant agencies have been futile over the years. The Embakasi West Mp said residents have allegedly witnessed harassment and brutality from land grabbers.  Theuri urged the department committee on lands in the national assembly to look into the matter urgently. In August 2016, residents blocked Kangundo Road for three hours , protesting against grabbing of of the 818 acre piece of land.  They claimed to have gone to the police with documents only to be told that ownership of the land belonged to Kiambu Dandora group. In 2014 there were also protests over the same.  Members alleged to belong to the said association pulled down stalls and businesses build on the land claiming to be legal owners.
