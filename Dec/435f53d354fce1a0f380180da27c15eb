Busia residents have asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to intervene and help hasten the construction of the Busia-Malaba Road which is being upgraded to bitumen standards. The residents who included boda boda operators and traders said the contractor tarmacking the 28-kilometre road should have his contract terminated if he cannot hasten the work. "The Chinese contractor working on the 35-kilometre Malaba-Angurai-Kawalun road has tarmacked more than half of the work yet this one has done nothing," Malaba resident Ernest Wafula said. President Kenyatta commissioned the tarmacking of the two roads on December 18, 2016. He assured residents that he would return to launch them after 18 months. The two roads will be the first to be tarmacked in Teso when complete. A kiosk operator Harrison Oyumbu said the poor state of the road has caused many boda boda accidents where women and children have broken their legs. "The situation is worse during the rainy season with waterlogged trenches," Oyumbu said. Â
