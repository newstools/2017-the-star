Bungoma MCAs have finally approved the 10 county executive nominees. The names were approved yesterday. This comes after an unsuccessful attempt on Tuesday. There were complaints most of the executives do not reside in Bungoma. Governor Wycliffe Wangamati had been unable to appoint executives and chief officers three months after taking office. MCAs on Tuesday afternoon delayed attending a special sitting that had been convened to pass the list. They were said to be holed up at the governor’s home in the Ndengelwa area, discussing the list. Speaker Emmanuel Situma was forced to adjourn the sitting. “We have come in late and as we had earlier planned, we were supposed to discuss the report and be able to vote on the same, which can’t happen now,’ he said. Situma continued, “Since the report is bulky, this House will give members soft copies and hard copies for them to read and consume and come back later on notice for debate and approval.” The MCAs walked out of the House chanting in loud voices ‘Mutaki must go! Mutaki must go!’ Led by Mukuyuni ward MCA Meshack Museveni (pictured), the MCAs denied Mutaki’s claims they had received cash from the governor to carry out their duties. Museveni said MCAs should carry out their oversight role without any influence because that is what they were elected to do. “We wanted to pass the names of the CECs to get into office and begin serving residents, but this man called Mutaki has been spreading lies,” he said.
