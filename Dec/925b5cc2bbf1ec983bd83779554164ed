Little-known Al-Azar High School in Garissa broke into cheers on Wednesday after it produced the county’s best student in the KCSE exam. Abdi Barre, 18, scored a mean grade of B+ to emerge tops in the drought-stricken county. His parents were forced to register as refugees in the expansive Dadaab camps after losing their livestock to the 1992 drought. They are Kenyans. Many residents were forced to register as refugees to get food rations. Al-Azar manager Ahmed Sambur said Abdi had at one point dropped out of school as he struggled to raise fees. Abdi’s mother died 10 years ago. He stays with his grandmother at the camp. His father stays at the Hagadera refugee camp. “We saw the potential in him early enough and went for him. We could not allow him go to waste,” Ahmed said. Ahmed said they enrolled Abdi at the private school and bought him stationery. “We are proud because has hasn’t disappointed us. We appeal to our leaders to support him further,” Ahmed said. A visibly delighted Abdi narrated his struggles.  “It was sheer determination that gave me hope to continue. There were low moments when I lost my mother and when I temporarily dropped out of school,” Abdi said. The first born in a family of five said he wanted to study medicine. He encouraged students to focus on their studies, saying it doesn’t matter which school or what circumstances they were in. “Most students look for scapegoats when they don’t perform well. But with hardwork and discipline, any candidate whether from Mandera or Nairobi — can make it,” Abdi said. Ayale Abdi, who scored B- (minus) from the same school thanked his teachers and parents for his achievement. “They supported and encouraged us a lot,” Ayale said
