Two suspects were charged at Voi Law Courts on Monday with destruction of infrastructure and sabotage of the Standard Gauge Railway. Anthony Katembo and Mwarabu Makoji were arrested on Saturday near Voi station in connection to the theft and vandalism of SGR batteries.  They denied the charges before chief magistrate Ann Karimi.  Katembo was released on Sh200,000 cash bail or Sh300,000 bond.  The court turned down a request to release Makoji on bond as he is facing a similar case in a Mombasa court.  The case will be mentioned on December 22 and heard on January 18, 2018. On Saturday, Mwatate deputy county commissioner Kenneth Muriungi warned residents against engaging in vandalism.
