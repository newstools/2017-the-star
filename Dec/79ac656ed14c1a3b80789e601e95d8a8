Two men on Thursday night died in separate accidents as the death toll of the Nairobi-Nakuru highway continued to rise.  In the first incident, a man died in an accident involving three vehicles near the Gilgil weighbridge. Five others were seriously injured. Witness Amos Kibe said a truck heading to Nakuru from Nairobi caused the crash. He said it was overtaking a number of cars, when it swerved back to its lane to avoid a head-on collision with an oncoming matatu. “The driver of the truck lost control and hit two cars. An occupant of one the cars died and others were seriously injured,” he said. The injured were rushed to Gilgil Subcounty Hospital. The cars were were towed to the area police station. In the second incident, a man was killed by a speeding car in a hit-and- run accident at Karai centre, 10kms from Naivasha town. He did not have any identification documents. The deceased is reported to have been crossing the road. This brought to six the number of people who have been killed on the road in the last four months. Residents have raised concern over the frequent accidents and loss of lives. According to Joseph Kabono, a local leader, hit-and-run accidents along the road on the rise. He blamed speeding for the accidents. In the latest case, residents on Friday found the man’s body on the road and reported to the police. “The man’s identity is not known. Police took the body to Naivasha Subcounty Hospital mortuary,” he said. Kabono said bumps should be erected along the highway to control speed.
