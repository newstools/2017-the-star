Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati has praised the county assembly for sending home the six members of the Public Service Board. He said the board, which was appointed by former Governor Kenneth Lusaka, was plagued by corruption and nepotism. Wangamati the assembly’s move will allow creation of a new board. “I did not send the board home. It’s the members of the assembly, who were dissatisfied by its work," he said on Sunday at Kimaeti Catholic Church in Bumula constituency. A board member has filed an application at the Labour Court in Kisumu to stop their dismissal. The court directed the members to continue in office, pending a ruling on February 5. The board’s tenure was expected to expire next year. The board and the county chief have been feuding over county appointments. Wangamati accused the board of demanding a Sh50,000 bribe from job applicants. It denied the claim. Last month, the county assembly’s Public Administration Committee, led by Naitiri Kabuyefwe MCA Joan Lukatiri, investigated the board.
