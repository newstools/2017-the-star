The planned swearing-in of NASA leader Raila Odinga is illegal, Mumias East MP Benjamin Washiali has said. Speaking in his constituency on Sunday, Washiali dismissed the planned swearing-in as child's play, saying it will lack the instruments of power. Last week, Raila declared he will be sworn in by the People's Assembly. "It is wishful thinking,"
Washiali said. "To be
sworn in as President, you need to be declared as a winner of a presidential election by IEBC and then be
sworn in by the Chief Justice,” Washiali added. He criticised the opposition for the formation of the People's Assembly, saying they are not recognised by the Constitution. The People's Assembly motion has already been passed in 13 counties. "The People's Assembly that NASA is forming won't go far because it lacks foothold in
law-making," Washiali said. He asked the opposition to instead raise their concerns through Parliament. He urged Kenyans to ignore the opposition and support the government. "We had divergent views during
the campaigns. It is now time to come together and
remember we are all Kenyans," he said.
