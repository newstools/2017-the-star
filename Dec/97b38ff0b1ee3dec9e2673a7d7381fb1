An online shopping website has invented a way to end scamming for shoppers via the internet which is the biggest setback for the modern day shopping. Africawares.com which is the latest shopping site in Kenya protects the shoppers' payment until one has confirmed receipt of the goods. “Since they were established, Some of the largest classified websites in Kenya have grown to become a place where Scammers and robbers reside. After so much outcry from the public over the increase of online scammers, we came up with a very clever solution. We started a company ‘Africawares’ that uses technology to keep customers safe. It’s 2017, we don’t have to succumb to online fraud," director Kipngeno Enock said. Read: Online shopping craze 14% up since 2014 Enock said the company came up with ways where a shopper is able to use Merchant Assurance or Secure Payment services giving him control of his money until the product is delivered. He said that there is no cash transaction even for deliveries to ensure there is no possible scam or criminal exchange between the company employees and customers. "We use Mpesa or Airtel money to secure your money. This way details of the buyer, seller and the transaction is captured by the system and you’re sure to get your money if you’re the seller. If you’re the buyer, and you go meet a seller, no cash will be exchanged. You will know exactly who you’re meeting. If you don’t like the product or is not as described, you will get the money back directly to your phone." This comes as online retailers are about to open and offer huge discounts during this holiday period making Kenyans likely to fall prey to cyber attacks.   click here for the latest political news
