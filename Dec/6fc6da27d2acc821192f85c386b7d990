An Embu court has urged a petitioner to withdraw a case he filed to stop the approval of Governor Martin Wambora’s 20 nominees of various county jobs. Former Kiambere MCA Martin Mwangi filed the petition last Thursday to stop the approval of the county secretary, 17 chief officers and two county public service board members. The officials were sworn in on Friday night after the county assembly gave its approval. Resident judge Florence Muchemi said Mwangi’s application had been overtaken by events as the officers had already been approved and taken the oath of office before interim injunction orders were issued. Through lawyer Charles Kamunde, Mwangi had sought to amend the application to seek orders to stop the gazettement of the officers. But the court said amending the application is “ill-advised”. Muchemi told Mwangi he could withdraw the suit and file a fresh one to stop the gazettement of the officers. The hearing was set for today. Mwangi says Wambora has discriminated against the Mbeere subcounties and gave them fewer county positions.
