One person has died, while 29 others are fighting for their lives in hospitals in a suspected cholera outbreak in Kianjai ward and Mbeu ward, Tigania West, Meru county. Mainda Mathina, 95, from Lairang’i village, died on Tuesday afternoon, while his son, Mugambi Kirigo, and wife are admitted to an Isiolo hospital with symptoms of cholera — vomiting, abdominal pains and diarrhoea. But Meru county public health director Ephantus Kariuki ruled out cholera. He said their laboratory report showed the victims suffered from ameobiasis — a bacterial infection transmitted through contaminated food or water. Kariuki said most of the victims are adults aged 30-70. He said the deceased may have died because of dehydration “after he refused to take water or eat”. “At that age, the mzee could pass on easily,” he said. “Some of those affected are drunkards. Most cases started on Friday, when the Chritsmas holiday began.” Kariuki said 21 cases had been reported at Ruiri Mission Health Centre, five cases at Chaaria Hospital and two at Meru Referral Hospital. Residents want the county and national health officers to act swiftly to contain the outbreak. They have called for door-to-door vaccination in affected areas. They blamed the problem on lack of clean water and added it should have been prevented.  Lairang’i sublocation manager Norman Mwiti said most families cannot access clean water for drinking and domestic use. This has made them helpless and vulnerable to infections, he said. Mwiti said water from Mburanaro stream in Buuri constituency and boreholes is contaminated. The villagers are adamant they won’t use the water, fearing it could lead to more infections. Subcounty health officials, Mwiti and assistant chief Kawira Mwenda visited the affected families. Local administrators have warned residents against visiting their friends, relatives or sharing belongings or food in gatherings. They urged households to boil water for drinking.
