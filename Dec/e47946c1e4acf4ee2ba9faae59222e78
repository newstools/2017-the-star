Former
Lamu Woman Representative Shakilla
Abdalla has asked the national government to compensate those displaced
after their lands were acquired for the expansion of the Lamu-Garsen
road. Abdalla yesterday criticised the government for delaying the compensation. “It is surprising that the government hasn’t
said a thing about compensating those displaced by the road construction. We appreciate good roads but justice to the people is key," Abdalla said. The construction
of the 135-kilometre road was officially launched by President Uhuru Kenyatta when
he toured Witu town on March 9. Uhuru said the government had set aside Sh10.4 billion for the
expansion of the road. Abdalla questioned the slow pace at which the construction was
taking place.She asked the government to speed up the process. She
said it will be best for the government to speed up the road so as to reduce
the increased cases of insecurity which is precipitated by the constant
presence of Alshabaab on the road.   She
said the road will open up Lamu to more trade,industry and economic
opportunities. Shakilla
criticized Lamu governor Fahim Twaha and other leaders for going silent on the
matter instead of pushing for justice for their people. “Our
leaders can do better than just keeping mum and acting like they have no
idea.They should push for the speedy construction of the road in as much as
they will push for the compensation of those affected.The road was launched
more than seven months ago but nothing has yet to come out of it,”said
Shakilla. The
main Lamu-Garsen has been in dilapidated condition for over 50 years.
