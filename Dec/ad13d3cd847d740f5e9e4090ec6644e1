Kimilili residents living in grass-thatched houses will soon be all smiles as MP Didimus Baraza has promised them iron sheet housing. Baraza noted many residents are poor so he will work hard to improve their lives. He said he had set aside Sh800,000 for the project which will begin in May next year. “I have set up a committee to identify 10 families in the four wards in my constituency, whose members are still living in grass-thatched houses so I can construct iron sheets houses for them," he said. "This is the only way I can help my people who trusted me with their votes." Each house in Kibingei, Kimilili, Maeni and Kamukuywa wards will cost between Sh30,000 and Sh40,000. Baraza said the project will take place in phases, the first being demolishing the grass-thatched houses and the second involving homes widows homes. “Such houses will be demolished and new ones constructed if need be so we can raise a community whose health is a priority." Speaking in Kimilili during Christmas Day celebrations on Monday, the legislator said poverty will be a thing of the past in the next five years. "I am planning to launch mass development projects to benefit all residents," he added, noting he promised to fully represent the people at the National Assembly.
