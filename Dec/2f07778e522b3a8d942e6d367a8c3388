Minister Fred Matiang’i has dissolved boards of primary and secondary schools sharing a compound and said they will have one principal and two deputies. The Education Cabinet Secretary made the announcement on Monday, during the launch of the Form 1 selection exercise at Kenya Institute for Curriculum Development. "Performance where both primary and secondary sections [are] in the same environment has often been beset with legitimacy squabbles and turf wars which tend to compromise teaching and learning programmes," he noted.  “The move will occasion harmony and synergy in the utilisation of resources and infrastructure facilities, some of which lie defunct because resources are duplicated, and institutions compartmentalised, creating non-functional facilities." Matiang'i said the Teachers Service Commission was in agreement and that the change would be immediate. “With immediate effect, we are dissolving the boards and creating one, so that if a primary school and a secondary school are in one compound they will have one board,” he said. The CS said the Education ministry and the TSC will consolidate the management of such schools effective 2018, so they have one board of management. One of the deputies will be in charge of the primary school and the other of the secondary school, he noted.
