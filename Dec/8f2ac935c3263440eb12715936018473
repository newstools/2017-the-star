Outgoing St Patrick’s High School-Iten principal Wilson Yego has welcomed his transfer to St Joseph’s Boys’ High School-Kitale, saying it is a promotion. He said on Tuesday St Joseph’s High has a higher enrollment compared to St Patrick’s High. Yego said a transfer from a school with low enrollment to one with more students means advancement. “I was the principal of St Patrick’s High until Thursday last week. I’m now the new principal of St Joseph’s High,” he said. Yego spoke during a students’ mentorship programme in Tuturung, Marakwet East. He said he is ready to leave the Elgeyo-Marakwet-based school to take over as the new head of the Kitale-based school when schools reopen on Tuesday next week. St Joseph’s School outgoing principal Peter Obwogo will be the new head of St Patrick’s High School. St Joseph’s High was ranked 23rd nationally in the KCSE exam results released last week. It had a performance index of 63.66. St Patrick’s Iten had 60.75 at 37th nationally. Teachers’ union officials have protested against the decision by the TSC to carry out countrywide transfers of head teachers.
