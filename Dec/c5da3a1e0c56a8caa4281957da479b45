Police in Homa Bay have seized 16 motorbikes in connection with the burning of a bus on Sunday. Boda boda riders have also been banned from operating past 8pm. “The ban will be implemented with immediate effect to avoid cases of insecurity in the town,” county police commander Marius Tum said yesterday. He continued, “We are keenly investigating this matter to ensure the suspects are arrested. The motorbikes will help us apprehend the suspects.” Boda boda riders torched the bus that belongs to Otange Bus Service when one of their colleagues was injured after ramming into the vehicle.  He later died. The bus driver had stopped the vehicle on the road as he waited for a passenger to alight and remove his luggage from the boot. The boda boda rider identified as Felix Omondi, 26, rammed into the bus. Minutes later, a group of boda boda riders set the bus ablaze. “Omondi died on Sunday evening at Homa Bay Referral Hospital where he was undergoing treatment,” Tum said. He said police have met leaders of boda boda operator associations and directed them to provide a list their members. “We want to ensure they are regulated within the law,” Tum said. He said police are pursuing leads to help pin down the culprits. “The arson was uncalled for and we must condemn it. We have crucial leads which will help us apprehend the suspects,” Tum said. Homa Bay Town East MCA Juma Awuor and the Homa Bay Giant Traders Association secretary general Jack Nyambega condemned the arson. They said such incidents will scare away investors. Awuor said, “It was the deceased who hit the vehicle that was parked before he got injured. The riders did not have to burn the vehicle.”
