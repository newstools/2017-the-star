Murang’a county commissioner John Elungata has directed police to shoot those found breaking into coffee factories to end stealing of the crop. Elungata has also directed factories to install CCTV cameras to protect their berries from thieves. He said factory break-ins had become rampant. “Police should not hesitate to shoot those found breaking into coffee factories," Elungata said. Elungata said some factory leaders had have been colluding with thieves to defraud farmers by stealing their coffee. He said the CCTV cameras will help capture those involved and ensure they are prosecuted. “We have realised that most coffee thefts are organised by factory managers who work with criminals. They normally get away with it because there is no evidence,” Elungata said. He said factories had deliberately ignored putting up stringent security measures because they were part of the theft cartels. "One wonders why the managers would install CCTV cameras in their residences and not in the factories where coffee worth millions of shillings are kept," Elungata said. Elungata said the theft is rampant during harvesting seasons. He decried the lack of conviction in the more than 10 cases that have been filed in court. He blamed wealthy businessmen, saying they are interfering with the prosecution of suspects. Last year, at least six coffee factories incurred losses after thieves broke into them and stole coffee worth millions of shillings. Two more factories have been broken into this year. Elungata asked the factories to reinforce their security by qualified and youthful guards to man the premises. “Most of the guards employed in the factories are too old and are not trained on security matters,” Elungata said. He said police had heightened their surveillance ahead of this season's harvesting. He urged farmers to cooperate with police.
