The government will spend Sh500 million to construct a dual carriage road along the Eldoret-Nakuru Road. Speaking yesterday at Sachangwan where several people died in a grisly road accident, Roads and Infrastructure Principal Secretary John Mosonik said the construction with begin either in January or February. "We will have to divert Sh500 million meant for other projects for construction of dual carriage way to minimise accidents along this deadly spot," he said. Mosonik said the road will be completed between six to eight months. At the same time, Kenyan National Highways Authority officials will begin marking the road for bumps to be erected. The PS cautioned motorists to avoid speeding and overtaking carelessly. He said there would be more road blocks by the police and NTSA. Mosonik said the ministry will consider diverting vehicles heading to Kericho to use the Njoro-Molo route, those bound to Eldoret to use Kabarak-Ravine road so as to ease congestion during this festive season. He further recommended that the use of older road bypassing the main road be opened soon. He was accompanied by Kenha officials and Nakuru governor Lee Kinyanjui.
