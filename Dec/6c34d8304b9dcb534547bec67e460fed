The number of votes cast in 130 polling stations in Narok exceeded that of registered voters by more than 20,000, the High Court in Naivasha has heard. This came up during the ongoing petition against Narok Senator Ledama ole Kina (pictured). Judge Christine Meoli heard from two witnesses that the IEBC allegedly bungled the August 8 election, leading to the petition. The petition has been filed by former Narok South MP Nkoidila ole Lankas, who ran on the Jubilee ticket, and Andrew Kiplagat, who ran on the National Vision Party. Kiplagat said 84,958 votes were cast in the 130 polling centres against the IEBC records that had 59,765 registered voters. The petitioner said data contained in forms 38A and 38B was different from the one in Form 38C. He further told the court that Kina used his national ID to register for the ODM nominations, but later used his passport while handing over his documents to the IEBC. Sirere ole Kaikai, who was the chief agent of Lankas, accused the IEBC of keeping the party agents in darkness over incoming results. He said poor network coverage in parts of the county affected the flow of results. “Agents at the tallying centre were not updated on the results and all we saw were unconfirmed figures on the electoral agency portal,” he said. Narok county returning officer Anastacia Kimeu admitted that form 38C had some errors. She said the error was corrected and the other discarded. She accused the petitioners of using the discarded form in the petition and IEBC had the correct document.
