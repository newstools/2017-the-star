Governors in Nyanza have been urged to streamline employment to reduce the bloated wage bill. Homa Bay Senator Moses Kajwang’ said the counties are grappling with structural development due to high recurrent expenditure. He said the counties have received more than Sh120 billion since the inception of devolution but have little development to show for it. Kajwang' was speaking in a morning talk show on Ramogi FM. He urged governors Anyang’ Nyong’o (Kisumu), Cornel Rasanga (Siaya), Cyprian Awiti (Homa Bay) and Okoth Obado (Migori) to prioritise economic growth. “We acknowledge a good number of our people are still jobseekers but my appeal to the area governors is to work within their CIDP to ensure economic growth,” Kajwang' said. He urged the county chiefs to reorganise their employment sectors to avoid being accused of spending public funds on ghost workers. “It’s true these counties lagged behind in development in the past regime but we should ensure the salaries people earn are commensurate to services they give to residents,” Kajwang’ said. “Most people ask where funds generated locally go. They should be utilised appropriately for the benefits of locals,” he said.
