All stalled vehicle on the roads must be removed within one hour, National Transport Safety Authority has said. In a notice on Tuesday, NTSA said stalled vehicles that are not removed within the hour will be towed to the nearest police station at the owner's cost. "Motorists and motor vehicles owners are further advised that immediately upon stalling of a vehicle cautionary measures are taken to alert other road use." Motorists are expected to place clearly visible legal signage and notifying NTSA on 0718555999 or the national police service on 999/911. "This notice takes effect immediately," it added. Traffic jams in most of the country are caused with stalled vehicles that can take more than two hours even days on the roads. Previously, there was no specific time as to when a stalled vehicle was to be towed. According to the Traffic Act, the vehicles were to be removed as soon as possible. “The driver of any vehicle shall, in case of a break-down, remove the vehicle from the road as soon as possible, and until so removed the vehicle shall be placed as close to the side of the road as possible; and as the vehicle remains on the road between the hours of 6.45pm and 6.15am," the Act reads.
