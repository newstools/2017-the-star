Embu Education executive John Ngari yesterday warned principals of day secondary schools against exploiting parents by charging high fees for feeding programmes. Ngari, a former secondary school head, said some principals charge as high as Sh19,000 for the programmes, when Sh10,000 is way enough for a whole year. He is also in charge of youth empowerment and sports. “Let’s be merciful to parents to assist our children,” Ngari said during a meeting with eight Wings to Fly beneficiaries at Canan Guest House in Embu town. He said unscrupulous school heads take advantage of parents to make a killing. The county will form a committee to harmonise fees for feeding programmes in day schools, he said. Ngari said the majority of the county’s students are in day schools. The national government plans to offer free day secondary education when the schools reopen next week.
