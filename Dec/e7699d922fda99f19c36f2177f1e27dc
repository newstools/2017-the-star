Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru on Wednesday stormed Kianyaga Subcounty Hospital after residents complained of being turned away and forced to buy drugs from private chemists.  Earlier she had been lectured by angry residents when she said all hospitals are fully stocked with drugs. One elderly woman took Waiguru to task. "Last week my grandchild was taken ill with pneumonia and had
difficulty in breathing. We visited Kirinyaga hospital and after
consultation we were informed that there are no drugs. The only option
was to go and buy at a private chemist. I spent Sh2,000 on drugs," the woman said. Waiguru learnt of this at a public participation meeting to discuss the county's Vision 2035 After the meeting Waiguru drove straight to the hospital where residents complained they are forced to buy drugs.
