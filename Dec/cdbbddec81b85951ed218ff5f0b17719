he Matatu Owners Association is demanding an audit of bank accounts of traffic police officers. The association claims the officers are demanding  bribes to enrich themselves and have neglected their mandate to ensure law and order on roads.  Chairman Simon Kimutai, meeting with the EACC, said the anti-graft agency should move swiftly and investigate all accounts owned by the officers.  Kimutai alleged they are colluding with some officers of the Judiciary to mint money from the matatu sector.  “They  have the audacity to establish kangaroo courts and demand hefty fines from our members. They have agreed that every Sh3,000 they collect, they share equally. This must stop,” Kimutai said.  The MOA chairman said members of the saccos that have refused to pay the officers have been harassed and intimidated.
