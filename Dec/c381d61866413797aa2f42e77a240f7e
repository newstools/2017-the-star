The race to replace sacked Ugandan head coach George Nsiimbe at Tusker FC has attracted more than 100 applicants with renowned Kenyan tacticians and their overseas counterparts tendering their applications. The job fell vacant in October after Nsiimbe was asked to step aside by the management of the club before being axed a month later. The club confirmed over 100 coaches are seeking the job.  Earlier on, sources had indicated that the top brass of the Ruaraka-based club had settled on former Sofapaka tactician Sam Timbe, claims that were dismissed by club’s chairman Daniel Aduda. He said Timbe was just among the top applicants. Aduda made it clear that the new coach to steer the Breweries to their 12th Kenyan Premier League title will be known on Monday next week. There were also rumours linking AFC Leopards head coach Robert Matano to the job but the latter dismissed them. Known for their financial muscle and the ability to lure high quality players to the club, the board is understood to be keen on a high profile coach who will guide the club in reclaiming their past glory. The radical change in the playing unit saw eight senior players being released, notably the 2014 Most Valuable Player and midfielder of the year Anthony Ndolo. Tusker finished in a unusual sixth rank with 50 points and Aduda confirmed that the club is on course to hire a reputable coach who will contest for next season’s Premier League, KPL Top eight and the under-20 championships.  “Its true that Timbe is part of the applicants of the coaching job but we have not settled on him. I can not guarantee he is a favorite too. We have received more than 100 applications from coaches within the country and outside but I can not reveal their names for purposes of confidentiality. Even our caretaker coach Francis Baraza has shown great interest in the job. We will be announcing the new head coach on Monday.”
