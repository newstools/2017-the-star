Pastors, residents and officials in Kilimambogo, Thika East, have ‘cleansed’ a notorious blackspot where 18 people died on Sunday night. In the prayer ceremony on Thursday they blamed the devil and evil forces. Bishop Paul Ngarama said evil forces are on a revenge mission after Kenyans maintained unity and refused to shed blood after the elections. “The accidents are unusual. It’s not because of road users’ recklessness, but the devil is on a blood-hunt. We rebuke all his plans during this festive season and pray that God protects His people,” Ngarama said. The accident involved a Kitui matatu from Kinatwa sacco and a lorry ferrying sand. The matatu driver tried to avoid hitting a boda boda rider and ended up in the opposite lane. There he collided with an oncoming lorry. Ngarama was joined by Bishop Moses Mbugua. They were joined by residents and local leaders. They prayed on the busy Thika-Garissa highway. Ngarama said the rash of recent accidents across the country is no longer a physical, but spiritual problem. Resident Joseph Mungai said there are evil spirits who pretend to be beautiful human women and confuse drivers. “We’ve heard of elegantly dressed women being spotted in the area, especially at night. “We suspect they are agents of doom who are sent to spill blood,” Mungai said. Mbugua of Redeemed Gospel Churches said concerted efforts should deal with road carnage that has so far claimed more than 200 lives in December. Mbugua said matatu operators should take responsibility for their lives and those of their passengers. All saccos should come up with stringent measures to ensure the crew does not violate traffic rules.
