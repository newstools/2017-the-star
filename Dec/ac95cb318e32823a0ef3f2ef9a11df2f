Samburu residents have accused the government of being reluctant to arrest and prosecute those cutting down red cedar trees.  The residents want the relevant authorities to join them in protecting Pura Forest from destruction.  They accuse business people of cutting down the red cedar trees for posts and timber.  The residents say the government has ignored the ban on red cedar logging.  More than 40,000 posts and pieces of timber were found hidden in the forest this month.  Resident Jacob Lekorpeter said part of the community has taken the initiative to protect the forest from exploitation.  “We have agreed, as leaders and the community, that we should protect our forest,” Lekorpeter said at a meeting on Tuesday.  The memers resolved that more than 10,000 of the 40,000 red cedar posts kept at Pura AP camp should be used to build social amenities to punish the owner, who has since fled.
