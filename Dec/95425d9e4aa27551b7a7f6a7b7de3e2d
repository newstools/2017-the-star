The Nyandarua government will deliver on its manifesto, despite limited resources. "We actually promised Wanjiku that we will deliver. We have no choice,
whether we have resources or not. We must look for resources," Finance and Economic Planning executive Mary Mugwanja said. She spoke on Monday in Ol Kalou, where staff from various
county departments met to draft the County Integrated Development Plan
2018-2022. Mugwanja said residents want the right infrastructure, especially roads, value addition for agricultural produce and access to markets. She said more emphasis will be given to agriculture as it is the backbone of the Nyandarua economy. Electricity connection is another key area. Governor Francis Kimemia's
administration will work with the national government and energy
parastatals such as Kenya Power to improve connections. Â
