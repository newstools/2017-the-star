Mvita MP Abdulswamad Nassir is positioning himself to take over from Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho in 2022. Sources close to the lawmakers told the Star that Nassir will use his position as the chairman of the Public Investments Committee to fight for prudent use of funds, with the hope that it will endear him to residents. He has set his eyes on education funds, which he says must benefit students in the long run. “We will ensure that money set aside for public use is accounted for. That is our responsibility as Parliament and my
mandate as per the Constitution,” Nassir told the Star on Thursday. The MP has already earned a huge following among teachers, parents and other education stakeholders in Mombasa. But he will have to contend with the threat posed by Kisauni MP Ali Mbogo. Mbogo is also keen on taking over from Joho. Being an educationist, Mbogo's threat to Nassir cannot be downplayed, considering the fact that Kisauni is also the biggest constituency in Mombasa. “He will still use his position to fight for education. His
vision is to see education standards in Mombasa improve remarkably,” Nassir's aide
said.
