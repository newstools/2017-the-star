National Olympic Committee of Kenya president Paul Tergat has unveiled a high-profile team to serve in the marketing and fundraising commission.  The Central Bank chairman Mohamed Nyaoga will serve in the commission alongside senior counsel Donald Kipkorir and Patrick Obath, an associate director at Adam Smith International-Africa.  Others in the commission are Barclays Bank of Kenya marketing director Caroline Ndung’u, Architectural Association of Kenya chairperson Emma Milayo and IMG communications chief executive Peter Gicheru. The chairman of the board will be appointed in subsequent meetings among themselves. The board replaces the previous one that was chaired by Ndung’u Gathenji.  The team has been tasked with soliciting for funds to run Nock programmes which include Team Kenya’s preparation for next year’s Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast, Australia. Tergat said he went into a hunting mission to recruit eminent members of the society with proven track record upon his election as Nock boss. “As we launch our marketing and fundraising commission, which consists of the finest and eminent distinguished ladies and gentlemen of this country, the team will now shoulder Kenya’s national aspirations.” He said the board’s role will be to assist the Olympics umbrella body to mobilise resources to fund Nock programmes.  Nyaoga said the new team intends to put in place systems and structures to mitigate against non-accountability and misuse of funds. Nyaoga: “We shall come up with a resource mobilization strategy and have an execution matrix and develop a threshold on which to execute their mandate.”
