Segamian has become the first ward to be declared open defecation free in Narok. County deputy director of Health Edward Tankoi said all the 36 villages in the ward have met the World Health Organization standards. Speaking during a ceremony to award the ward at Sagamiani Primary School yesterday, Tankoi said only 73 villages out 1,500 in Narok county had been declared open defaecation free.  “Thirty-six are in Sagamian ward, 28 in Narok West subcounty while eight are in Trans Mara West,” Tankoi said. He urged residents to use toilets for proper sanitation to prevent diseases like cholera and diarrhoea.  “We want this ward to act as a role model to the other 29 in the county. It can only be possible if the rate of water borne diseases is minimal,” Tankoi said.  He said they will work with local NGOs and Amref to sensitise residents to build toilets. Area MCA Wesley Koech praised the residents. He said those defaecating in the bush will be arrested and charged in court.
