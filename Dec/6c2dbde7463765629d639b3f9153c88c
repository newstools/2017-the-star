 An advocate of the High Court, Ham Langat, has filed an application at the Milimani Law Courts seeking orders restraining the police from harassing him. Through lawyer Obat Wasonga, Langat claimed his woes started after he testified at the Machakos Law Courts in an election petition challenging Governor Alfred Mutua’s (pictured) win. Langat said on September 5, he testified in a case challenging Mutua’s win after he was commissioned on oath. The petitioner is Wavinya Ndeti.  “After the session, Jonah Kirui, alias Persius Hunter, and armed Flying Squad officers from Chumvi police station stormed my residence and harassed me,” Langat said. He said they blocked his wife, went into his bedroom and took pictures. Langat said his family was warned of dire consequences. He said since yesterday he and his family have suffered a lot of psychological torture. “He has not been able to attend to his client’s case since he testified,” Wasonga said. Langat said unless the court intervenes, he faces great danger.  He said every person has a right to freedom and security and it is unconstitutional to be detained without a fair trial.It is illegal to subject anyone to any form of violence , Langat said.  “One should not be subjected to torture of any kind, whether physical or psychological or punished in a cruel, inhuman and degrading manner,” he said.
