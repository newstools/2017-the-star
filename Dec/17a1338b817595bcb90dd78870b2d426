The directive by Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i stopping universities from opening satellite campuses has hurt smaller institutions. Rongo University vice chancellor Samuel Gudu yesterday said institutions that were chartered recently have been hard hit by the directive, which will cut off enrolment.  “The move has affected administration and revenue from private students, who pay more money,” he said. The university is among those that had planned to open satellite colleges only two years after being given a full charter. The directive, however, was in good faith as it will streamline the quality of education, Gudu said. Smaller universities have embarked on internal expansion to build more infrastructure and enrol more students.  4 PHD graduands Gudu said Rongo University has 128 acres, which will be developed in expansion plans to run between 2017 and 2022. The university has 6,300 students and plans to increase enrolment by at least 1,000 annually.  Gudu said universities are waiting for an official directive from the government on laws governing contracts, instead of permanent and pensionable schemes used before the ban. The VC spoke ahead of today’s second graduation since the university was awarded a full charter from Moi University.  Some 1,080 students will graduate in a ceremony to be presided over by chancellor Mohammed Yusuf and university council chairperson Joyce Mutinda. The university will for the first time have four PhD graduands, three from Education and one from Arts and Social Sciences. They received part of Sh100 million grants for research from the national government and donors.
