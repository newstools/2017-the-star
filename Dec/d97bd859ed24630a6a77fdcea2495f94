Mwingi Central MP Gideon Mulyungi has accused area Equity bank manager Philip Nthumo of bias in selecting needy students for the 'Wings to Fly' scholarships. The MP claimed he is supposed to be in the selection committee to identify students in need of funding. "Your work is to sit in the office and you cannot know the needy pupils better than us. Some parents have complained to me on the corruption issue as well," Mulyungi said. He said they will reject students selected if they feel they are not among the needy. But Nthumo denied the claims, saying the MP is accusing him before they have even begun selections. "None of the parents complained. How could I take money from such needy and poor parents," he said. The Mwingi branch manager said the 46 students shortlisted on Friday were contacted in an open and transparent manner. "Out of the 46, we are only taking eight from the larger Mwingi. If anything, the MP is represented by the CDF chair and he cannot be included in the selection committee," Nthumo added. Miriam Kyalo, Mwingi subcounty Education director, said there is no bias and such claims should be raised immediately and appropriately. She said there are plenty of opportunities for needy students even if they fail to receive the 'Wings to Fly' scholarship. Muusi Kilonzi, a parent to one of the shortlisted candidates, said the interview was good and transparent, and she hopes her daughter is selected to join Muthale Girls'.
