A Nairobi school has challenged its deregistration by the Ministry of Education over cheating in this year's
KCSE exam. Compit Education Centre moved to court seeking to reverse the ministry's decision. In a case filed at the high court ,Compit Education Centre
wants the court to reverse the decision saying that their rights have been
violated. Through lawyer David Muthama, the school said it rights have been violated. It said it was duly registered on January 26, 2013. Muthama said the deregistration was communicated to the school on December 6. It has since been evicted from its premises in
Pangani. Muthama said the eviction was malicious and against the rules of the natural justice. He said they were not given a chance to defend the school from the allegations. The school said all students who sat KCSE at the centre received their results.
 “It is clear that TSC acted unlawfully in
deciding to deregister and subsequently evict the school from
its premises," Muthama says. He asked the court to urgently hear the matter. Justice John Mativo certified the case as urgent and granted
the school leave to file and serve the suit papers to all the respondents, before they appear
in court next week for inter-parties hearing. The Ministry have de-registered several schools for allegedly
engaging in exam cheating and instructed the affected schools to inform the parents
of the said decision. Matiang’i also gave warning to the schools found engaging in
the malpractices that the Ministry and TSC will take action against the said Centre
Managers or officials involved in the misconduct. The case will be mentioned on January 4.
