The stiff competition at Gor Mahia striking front has forced Timothy Otieno to seek playing time at Tusker FC as a free agent after his contract with the champions expired. Otieno failed to dispense either of the preferred duo of Jacques Tuyisenge and Meddie Kagere, forcing him to a super-subs status. The former Talanta forward penned a three-year contract with Tusker, where he is poised to muscle for a starting berth alongside his fellow signee, Robert Achema — from Western Stima. Otieno will inherit a huge task of proving the management of the club right in retrenching the experienced Allan Wanga, who was axed alongside nine other experienced players. Otieno played an integral part for Gor Mahia in clinching the 2017 SportPesa Premier League and the SportPesa Super Cup where he netted five goals, 10 shy of the number posted by Kagere and Tuyisenge. Gor had acquired the 2010 Copa Coca Cola Most Valuable Player (MVP) from Talanta in 2014 before loaning him to Posta Rangers in 2016 where he spiced his goal-poaching skills for a recall in April 2016. Club chief executive officer, Charles Obiny, confirmed the arrival of the duo in Ruaraka while calling for Football Kenya Federation (FKF) to reign on players fond of double-signing. “We have signed Otieno and Achema from Gor and Stima for three years respectively. They are quality additions to our side and we hope they will bring the change we are seeking. On players who have double-signed, the law is very clear and we are confident justice will prevail. They (Stephen Waruru and Lawrence Juma) were our players. They had penned contracts with us but opted for other clubs.” Tusker had earlier on signed Erick Ambunya from Kakamega Homeboyz, Apollo Otieno from Chemelil Sugar, Paul Muchika from Muhoroni Youth and Kevin Okoth from Western Stima.
