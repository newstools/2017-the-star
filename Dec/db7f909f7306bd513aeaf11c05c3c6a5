The transfers of school heads by the TSC has caused such a ruckus in the education sector. A close analysis of the transfers shows that the principals and institutions affected are spread across all regions and counties of the country, and from all communities and genders.  The Commission says it is implementing the policy of de-localisation, which was drawn up with the participation of the public and professional stakeholders over the last four years. While the transfers have been welcomed by the professional body — the Kenya Secondary Schools Heads’ Association — from which the principals are drawn, the Kenya National Union of Teachers has led an array of bodies and individuals stridently opposed to the exercise. Ulterior motives have also been ascribed. While it is clear that significant changes are happening in the education sector that will culminate in the new curriculum beginning next year, these noble initiatives will suffer immeasurably if the ministry and its agencies continue to fudge, mumble and bumble in explaining the motives behind its actions and plans. It boils down to communication.
