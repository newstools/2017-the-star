Data generated from the implementation of programmes in the Lake Victoria Basin should be harnessed to inform future programming and policies. Lake Victoria Basin Commission executive secretary Ally Matano said they have conducted a regional scientific conference, media training and a PHE symposium over the last one year as a way of creating knowledge platforms for free exchange of information for many players. “Of significance is that these platforms provide opportunities for players to jointly dialogue, and eventually come up with acceptable recommendations that contribute to programming and policy formulation,” said Matano. He spoke at Imperial Golf View Hotel in Entebbe, Uganda, when he opened an LVBC Knowledge Management Strategy for 2017-2022 validation workshop.
