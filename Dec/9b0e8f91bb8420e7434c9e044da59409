Ten people died after a matatu and lorry collided at Makutano near the Eldama Ravine junction on Saturday night. Three people sustained serious injuries and were rushed to Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret. Eldama Ravine subcounty medical officer Sheila Mwaruka said despite efforts to respond to the situation, the lack of a CT scan machine made treatment difficult. "We don't have a CT scan [machine] to check the damage and so we referred victims to MTRH," she said. Close to 150 people have died in road accidents in the month of December. More than 30 people died on Jamhuri Day after a multiple crash involving 15 vehicles in Sachangwan. The night before, a family of 19 died in another multiple crash at Mfupi bridge in Bungoma.
