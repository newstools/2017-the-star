Let’s be honest here. Khaligraph Jones sports perhaps the most dexterous flow ever witnessed in Kenyan mainstream scene. The high-speed rapper could only rely on his side-splitting verbal agility to get him as many hits as he would like.  It took him a long time to influence the masses, but his reputation since he released his first hit has essentially been the same. He has been somewhat reliant on his Olympic speed and even more on the innumerable scandals  to keep him in the headlines.  Khaligraph understands that orchestrating publicity stunts can be absolutely necessary to a rapper trying to get his music played, to get people talking or instant fame. This year, he has employed a number, with his latest being last weekend’s Jameson Connects Kenya concert, where fans got to witness him rise from a coffin just before he started his performance. And considering his career highlights this year, we are all too familiar with Jones’ cringe-worthy move to want to join the likes of Vera Sidika by ‘lightening’ his skin just to get people talking and to listen to his unoriginal version of Future’s  “Mask Off”.   All publicity is good publicity, and to an admirable extent, it has earned Jones quite the much-needed traction in the recent years. He is probably the most-sought-after rapper at the moment and that has earned him tremendous airplay and shows. But is this what music is all about? Now that he has the numbers, shouldn’t he be working towards creating masterworks? The truth is, his music lacks in several key elements. He subscribes to the notion of quantity over quality. He doesn’t inspire artistic freedom because half the time he is trading bars on other artistes’ beats.  Until today, we are yet to witness any solid, full-length release from the rapper. He needs to exhibit maximum potential if he wants to be crowned king.
