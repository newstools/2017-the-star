A Nairobi mason Joseph Owino struck it big after investing only Sh50 in Betway Jackpot draw. Owino won Sh900,000 after placing a multi bet of 12 matches and parting with Sh50 a week ago. The Chelsea FC fan and fringe gambler plans to invest the money in his children’s education and a business venture. The visionary Kahawa West man is not even excited by the fast approaching festive season to go holidaying and spending the cash with family. “I thank God for the win. Everyone has his own lucky day and it was my time. But you have to act for luck to come your way. I encourage everyone to bet,” Owino said as he received his cheque at Betway offices in Nairobi on Monday. “The win came at the right time, just when my son is set to join high school. It is a relief, given that I also have orphans under my care. I’ll also spare some coins to invest in a business,” added Owino who hails from Migori. His first born child has been admitted to a national schoolwhich he declined to disclose. After winning big, many people tend to shun betting but Owino has decided otherwise. “I have won tens of thousands in several instances, so this will not my last attempt at betting. It is a morale booster as I look forward to winning much more. I follow football and do my own personal predictions. I do not go with group frenzy on placing bets at all. The much I do with friends in terms of football is just little banter here and there,” he continued.
