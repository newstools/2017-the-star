Fifteen Shisha traders and smokers have moved to court to challenge the decision by Health CS Cleopa Mailu banning its consumption. They have filed an urgent application at the Milimani High Court accusing the CS of making an irregular decision. The traders argue that the decision banning the importation,sell advertising and even promotion of Sisha smoking in the country is detrimental to their business.

According to them, the notice by the CS is erroneous and it contravenes the constitution. The applicants also say it is discriminative. They want the court to suspend the ban pending hearing and determination of the case. The file is before justice John Mativo. On Thursday, the government banned smoking of shisha.  Health CS Cleopa Mailu, in a gazette notice, said they had banned the importation, manufacture, advertising and sale of shisha in this country. Anyone found contravening the new rules will be liable to a fine not exceeding Sh50,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or both. “No person shall import, manufacture, sell, offer for sale, use, advertise, promote, facilitate or encourage shisha smoking in Kenya,” the notice reads.
