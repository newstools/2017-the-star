Kieni MP Kanini Kega wants Jubilee Party to take disciplinary action against legislators who went against the party agreement during the formation of the parliamentary select committees. “If they have started opposing President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto this early, what will happen in future?” he asked. Kega said he supported their dewhipping. He spoke to the media on Sunday at Mlima Kenya PCEA Church. The Parliamentary Trade, Commerce and Industries chairperson said there were only 20 positions available and regional balancing had to be considered. Kega said in Nandi county, where Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter comes from, some of his colleagues have been appointed in various committees. He said Tinderet MP Julius Melly is the Education chairperson while Cornelius Serem of Aldai is the vice chairperson of Trade, Commerce and Industries committees. Kega said Kirinyaga county did not produce a single chairperson of any Parliamentary select committee and MPs from the area are not complaining. Last week, a section of MPs from the Rift Valley threatened to push for the impeachment of National Assembly Majority Whip Ben Washiali, if the party fails to heed their demands. They have also have threatened to resign en masse from the parliamentary committees if the punishment by the party against three of their colleagues is not rescinded. The move comes after Washiali wrote to MPs Keter, Silas Tiren (Moiben), Kangogo Bowen (Marakwet East) and Alex Kosgey (Emgwen) informing them that the party had discharged them from their respective committees. The list was endorsed during a Jubilee Parliamentary Group meeting at State House, where Uhuru directed Jubilee MPs to stick to it when electing House committee chairs and vice chairpersons. However, some MPs defied the order, saying it was not binding.
