More than 100 people living with disability in Nyandarua on Wednesday held protests in Ol Kalou town over what they termed exclusion from the county assembly and discrimination. They also accused Nyandarua elected leaders, except Senator Githiomi Mwangi, of ignoring them and not fighting for their rights. "We voted for them just like other able-bodied people," they said. They assembled at Nyandarua senator's office on the Ol Kalou-Nyahururu road, before going to the streets. They waved placards and chanted "haki yetu!" They said during the election, they were ferried on motorbikes and vehicles to go and vote for "these leaders". "After that, they stole our slots for nominations. Is it that our votes were disabled too?" Ol Kalou Disabled People Organisation chairman Peter Mbogo asked. Mbogo said people living with disability in the area will never associate with the Nyandarua assembly until they get a representation. Of the 39 MCAs in Nyandarua – 25 elected and 14 nominated – not a single is disabled. Mbogo said Nyandarua speaker Wahome Ndegwa is a God-fearing lawyer, who defend both the strong and the weak.
