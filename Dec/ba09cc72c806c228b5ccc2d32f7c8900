More than 800 people, including fifty bar operators, have been arrested and prosecuted in a fresh crackdown on increased sale and consumption of illicit alcohol in Eldoret. Uasin Gishu county commissioner Abdi Hassan on Friday said police have also impounded alcohol imported from Uganda for distribution in the region over the Christmas season. “We will not relent. Those involved in illegal alcohol sale and consumption will be sternly dealt with,” Hassan told the Star. He spoke at his office in Eldoret town. County alcoholic drinks licensing board director Sila Boit said the crackdown will be extended to other towns. Bar owners who operate beyond the stipulated hours are among those arrested and charged. “We will intensify the crackdown throughout the Christmas season when many alcohol traders tend to violate the law,” Boit said. Police were also cracking down on vehicles ferrying illicit alcohol along the Eldoret-Busia highway. Hassan said two people had been arrested and their vehicles impounded after being found with illicit liquor.He said the alcohol, imported from Uganda, was poisonous and harmful to human life. “A few years ago, we lost more than thirty people in Eldoret because of harmful alcohol. We won’t allow such brews back into the markets,” Hassan said He said police had been given orders to strictly deal with perpetrators. Hassan said some unscrupulous traders had planned to sell banned alcohol during the December festivities. Elders in Rift Valley have expressed concern over the return of poisonous alcohol imported from Uganda. Spokesman Kamunu Kabari asked the government to intensify the crackdown. Governor Jackson Mandago said he will lead a crackdown on illicit brews. He said illicit alcohol was ruining the lives of youth.
