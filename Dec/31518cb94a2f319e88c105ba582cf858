MCAs from Mandera have warned Governor Ali Roba against arbitrary sacking of county employees without following laid down procedures. Led by majority leader Abdi Hassan, they said they would not sit down and watch as the rights of the county staff are violated. Two months ago, the governor appointed a committee to go around all the six subcounties of Banisa,Takaba, Rhamu,Elwak,Lafey and Mandera East, and come up with a detailed report of county staff and ghost workers. The report revealed existence of hundreds of ghost workers, majority being unearthed in the health sector. Several staff have since been either sacked or sent on compulsory leave, among them health CEC and director, the chief officer health, the payroll officer, human resource officers with their deputies and the county revenue officers from all the six subcounties. “We are representatives of the people. The governor should have subsequently handed over the report to us before recommending action to should be taken,” Abdi said. MCA Hassan Hillow, who is the assembly chair of health committee, said it is the PSB that could have taken action or advised them on way forward. “We are telling the governor to stop rushing things. He needs to follow the law even as he goes about performing his duties and know that the assembly was created for a purpose,” Hillow said. MCA Kulow Ario said when they resume sittings in February, they would dissolve the PSB and engage the services of an independent audit firm to get the right picture on the ground. Roba who was elected on a jubilee ticket has had a frosty relationship with MCAs allied to the Economic Freedom Party, who are the majority in the house. They have accused him of making decisions without consulting them. On the other hand Roba has urged the MCAs to stop the squabbles and join him in developing the county.
