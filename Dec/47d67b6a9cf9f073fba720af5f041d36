The Presidency spent Sh2.7 billion, that cannot be satisfactorily accounted for, on confidential expenditure in the last three financial years.  Auditor General Edward Ouko said Sh2,729, 192,010 was spent in 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16.  The amount is broken into Sh685.6 million, Sh937.4 million and Sh1.1 billion spent respectively.  The report for the year ended June 30, 2016, showed queries raised over the expenditure were not satisfactorily explained.  The Presidency provided certificates to support the expenditure and explained that the purpose and particulars of the expenditure cannot be made public.

The audit revealed weak controls over confidential expenditure. The payment vouchers were not supported by necessary documents that could be subjected to audit tests to verify whether expenditure was for the intended purpose.  Examination of records revealed Sh165.5 million was paid to some companies for supply of motor vehicles in 2015-16 but it was not posted to the IFMIS ledger. “Verification of IFMIS ledger shows that these payments were not posted, an indication that they could have been unexplained cash withdrawals,” the report said. After examining the general ledger for 2015-16, confidential expenditure of Sh105 million was charged to the general suspense account without verifiable documents. “I am unable to confirm that the confidential expenditure incurred on motor vehicles and other payments or charge to general suspense account during the year under review was lawful and that there was value for money,” Ouko said.  The report further showed that the Presidency spent Sh22.3 million on requisitioning goods for various State Houses and State Lodges. But a verification conducted between January and February revealed the goods were never received and no documents were adduced to support receipt. “In the circumstances, the propriety of the expenditure totaling to Sh22, 324, 851 cannot be confirmed,” it continued.
