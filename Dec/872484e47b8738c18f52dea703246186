More than 1,200 nurses in Nakuru have demanded to be paid their three months salary arrears.  The nurses, under the KNUN, were among health workers who went on more than four months strike. County governments had withheld their salaries but their counterparts in other counties have received their pay.  Syprene Odera, the branch secretary general, said there is no clear communication from the employer on the matter.  “The nurses have not received salaries for the months of August, September and October despite the county government promising to make a lump sum payment this month. There has been no response to our demand and our letters have been ignored, ” she said.  However Governor Lee Kinyanjui said the employees were illegally on strike and even after being directed to report to work by CoG, they did not, only to demand pay for work they did not deliver.  He will meet with the employees on Monday to find way forward .
