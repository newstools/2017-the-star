West Pokot Governor John Lonyangapuo yesterday told the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission to investigate the Sh160 million Chepareria Technical Traning Institute building that collapsed before its construction was finished. He said no report has been released since the building collapsed a year ago. “This is misuse of public funds. The commission should come up with a report so those implicated are arrested and prosecuted,” Lonyangapuo said. The building is suspected to have collapsed because of poor workmanship. The National Construction Authority had stopped the construction, but the directive was ignored by the contractor — Chege-in General Contractors. The project was funded by the national government. The county boss has accused MP David Pkossing of colluding with the contractor to defraud the public. But Pkossing dismissed the claims and said the project falls under the Education ministry.
