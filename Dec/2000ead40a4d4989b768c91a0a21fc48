Visitors in Lamu during the Christmas festivities have been told to be careful while swimming in the sea. Lamu county Kenya Maritime Authority inspector Alexander Munga said many visitors insist on swimming but they lack the skills. He said such a move is suicidal. Speaking in his office on Wednesday, Munga asked visitors to seek help from local divers instead of endangering their lives.  He said residents will show them where and when to swim. Munga cautioned visitors against swimming during high tides and must be watchful of young child.  He also warned boat operators and sea farers against contravening maritime rules during the festive season when their services are much needed by visitors coming into the county.
