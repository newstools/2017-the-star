The Pangani Girls' dream has come true for two orphaned girls in Siaya county who were the best in KCPE examinations. Twins Pretty Natali and Precious Milan sang and danced with their family and friends after receiving the news at New Hope Academy. Natali scored 427 marks and Milan 423 marks out of 500. Their school posted a mean score of 333.5. "The girls have been doing exceptionally well. When our institution was established in 2013, we posted a mean score of 328.5. In 2014 we had 333.2 while in 2015 we had 303," school headmaster Joseph Odwal said on Thursday. Natali wants to be an electrical engineer and Milan a lawyer. “I love sciences...that is why I want to be an engineer,” Natali said. Milan thanked friends, teachers and relatives who supported them after their parents died. "After the death of our mother, we were forced to relocate to our uncle's home in Ugenya," she said, adding they had to drop out of Ngiya Girls' Boarding Primary School. Their mothers once taught at Ngiya Girls' Secondary School in the neighbouring Alego/Usonga constituency. Siaya education director Masibo Kituyi said the region posted good results and that girls dominated top positions in several schools.
