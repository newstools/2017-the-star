Employment of support staff for Embu ward representativesâ€™ and issuance of loans have stalled because of delay in forming the county assembly service board. For the three months MCAs have been in office, they have not staff. There is a standoff in the minority Mandeleo Chap Chap Party, which forwarded two nominees Newton Kariuki (Muminji ward) and Masters Mwaniki (Kiambere Ward), yet only one name is required. Speaker Josiah Thiriku yesterday said they resolved to have Mwaniki on the board for the time being as the party solves its problems. The board provides services and facilities to ensure efficient functioning of the county. The speaker, clerk, majority leader, minority leader of minority are in the board.
