Nyeri Governor Mutahi Kahiga (pictured) yesterday said he resigned as Knut Nyeri branch executive secretary on August 21. On Wednesday, Labour CS Phyllis Kandie published in a Gazette notice names of 11 trade unionists required to resign after their appointment to public office. Kahiga’s name is in the list. “I had earlier taken a three-month paid leave and handed over the running of the branch to my deputy Zack Mathenge as required by the Knut constitution to concentrate on campaigns,” he said in a statement. “I hold no union property though Knut owes me six months’ unpaid salary, pension payable to my former employer [TSC] and my retirement benefits. I am greatly disturbed by the impression created that I am still a Knut official.” Other unionists in Kandie’s list include Knut chairman Wilson Sossion and his Kuppet counterpart Omboko Milemba.
