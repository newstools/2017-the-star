Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria will have to pay former Justice minister Martha Karua Sh6.5 million for insinuating she procured witnesses to fix Deputy President William Ruto at The Hague. High Court judge Joseph Sergon announced the award yesterday, agreeing with Karua that the unsubstantiated allegations by Kuria damaged her reputation. “I enter judgment against the defendant and order him to pay Sh5 million as general damages, Sh1 million as aggregate damages, and a further Sh500,000 as exemplary damages plus interest at the court rate.” Related content : Martha Karua granted read-only access to KIEMS in Waiguru petition The judge said Kuria’s remarks were not only malicious, but also libellous. The award was, however, less than what Karua had demanded. The Narc Kenya leader wanted Kuria to pay her Sh20 million after the MP failed to defend the suit. Kuria found himself in trouble on September 21, 2015 after he sensationally announced at a political rally in Kapsokwony in Bungoma county that Karua was part of the PNU wing of the coalition government that took Ruto to The Hague. He alleged the then trial of Ruto was just an outcome of a political witch-hunt by the two contestants of the 2007 election - PNU and ODM. He claimed that he, Karua and other leaders met at Galileo in Westlands, where they schemed and came up with the plot on how witnesses were to be planted to testify against Ruto, who was then facing crimes against humanity charges following the 2007-08 post-election violence.
