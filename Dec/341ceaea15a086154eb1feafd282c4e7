A mother has appealed to well-wishers to help her one-year-old baby undergo heart surgery. The baby, Nevillle Israel, has two holes and a swelling in his heart. Doctors at Mater Hospital, Nairobi, said it will cost her Sh2 million to treat the child. He was born with the condition. But Irene Moraa, a mother of three, cannot raise the cash. She has opened a paybill account 686039 and can be reached on her mobile phone number 0726151510. On Thursday, Moraa said Israel cried persistently and became weak. Sometimes his skin darkens, she said. She first sought treatment at Kinondo Hospital. “They said the baby was okay provided he was eating well,” Moraa said. The problem persisted. She went to Bomu, Mombasa, where doctors said he had a bacterial infection in the blood system. They prescribed medicine, but there was no change. A Palm Beach doctor later diagnosed the condition.
