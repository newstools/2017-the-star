Persons with disabilities in Embu are up in arms over Governor Martin Wambora's failure to appoint their members as either county executives or chief officers.  The Embu branch of the Association of Physically Disabled People of Kenya said they are disappointed by Wambora. Association chairman Stephen Kathambara said they have skilled disabled people who are qualified to serve as executives or chief officers.  Kathambara accused Wambora of violating the Constitution, saying the law required that persons with disabilities be accorded at least 5 percent of elective and appointive positions. "We are asking the governor to consider
the disabled for other senior positions remaining in his government," Kathambara said. He said it was sad that most disabled people were being considered for junior positions such as revenue collection clerks.  Kathambara spoke at Karaba village in
Mbeere South on Sunday during celebrations to mark the International Day for
Persons with Disability. Embu chief officer for Gender and Culture  Jane Mugambi presided over the celebrations.
