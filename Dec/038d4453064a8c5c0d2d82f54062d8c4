EACC officials arrested former Devolution ministry official Hassan Noor outside a Nairobi court on Wednesday. The former senior administrator was apprehended shortly after the hearing of a case in which he and 15 others have been charged over a Sh47 million expense at the National Youth Service. Detectives took Noor, who vied for Mandera Governor, as he left Milimani Law Courts. He was arrested alongside suspect Samuel Odhiambo and taken away for questioning and recording statements on charges of abuse of office and conspiring to commit an economic crime. Officials from the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission want to question Noor over procurement of consultancy services at the ministry. The agency wants the former powerful provincial commissioner to explain a sensitisation programme to enable access to 30 per cent of reserved government tenders.
