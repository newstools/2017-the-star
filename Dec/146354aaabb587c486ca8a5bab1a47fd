In a statement, the two ward representatives said the proposal for Edith to inherit the Kitui West seat was ill-advised, as residents had not been consulted. They said it was dictatorial and unconstitutional for leaders to impose an MP on the people. They said the seat should be left for anyone who was interested to contest. “As elected leaders in Kitui West we disassociate ourselves from the statement by Mutua of Kauwi Ward endorsing a particular candidate without our consent,” the MCAs said. Nyenze passed away early this month at 60. He was Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka’s close ally.  His family said he had battle ill health for nearly 10 years. They said he was diagonised with colon cancer, followed by a respiratory ailment.  Fears of ill-health were sparked in August when Nyenze came to take the oath of office with an oxygen tank.
