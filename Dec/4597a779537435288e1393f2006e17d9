Police in Lamu are looking for an 80-year-old man who defiled a nine-year-old girl. The suspect allegedly committed the offence on December 13 in Sabasaba village. He is said to have lured the class three pupil with sweets worth Sh50 before defiling her. Nyumba Kumi elder Julius Mwangi said the man went into hiding once residents found out about the offence. "We are so angered that such a person can do what he did to a child young enough to be his great grandchild," Mwangi said. "We just heard screams from the girl and upon reaching the thicket, the old man had already fled. We can't find him," he added. Some residents threatened to kill the suspect if he shows up. "If police are unable to find him, we are appealing to the county commissioner to allow us to search for him and kill him," said John Kariuki. "He has destroyed the life of that young and innocent child," he added. County commissioner Gilbert Kitiyo said the suspect will be charged as soon he is found. Click here for latest political news
