Baringo Governor Stanley Kiptis wants the law against cattle rustling law changed to robbery with violence. He said the vice began in 1927 among pastoral communities in Baringo. Kiptis was speaking on Jamhuri Day in Mogotio, Baringo, on Tuesday. He urged Members of Parliament from the 17 counties affected by cattle rustling across the country to consider passing a motion in Parliament to replace the ‘dormant’ Cattle Rustling Bill.  “I humbly ask MPs to revise the bill to robbery with violence to deal firmly with bandits,” Kiptis said. “Pastoral communities have suffered huge loss at the hands of bandits,” he said. Kiptis said other retrogressive cultures such as FGM and early marriages drag back the communities.
