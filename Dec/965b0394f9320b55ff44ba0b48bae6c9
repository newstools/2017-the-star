Indian prime minister Narendra Modi faced his toughest year on the economic front in 2017. The BBC's Sameer Hashmi looks back at the year's key economic moments to predict what 2018 might look like. Only a year ago it seemed like India was on track to become an important engine of growth for the global economy. It was the fastest growing economy in the world in 2016, surpassing even China, which had been witnessing a slowdown. India was hailed as a bright spot in an otherwise gloomy global economy. But the narrative changed in 2017 as India's economy turned sluggish. Between January and December 2016, it grew by more than 7% in every quarter compared to the same period the previous year. During one quarter it even touched 7.9%. But in one quarter (April-June 2017), it fell to 5.7% - its lowest growth in three years. Two major decisions on economic policy had a severe impact on 2017. First was the sudden cancellation of nearly 86% of the cash in circulation in November 2016 - the effect lasted until 2017. But 2017 didn't bring only bad news for Mr Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party-led government, which swept to power in 2014. There were some major achievements as well, including India's 30-point jump to join the top 100 countries in the World Bank's "ease of doing business" index. Then the global credit rating agency Moody's upgraded India's sovereign credit rating for the first time since 2004. India's stock markets were among the world's best performing - they grew by more than 30% year on year. But overall, it was a tough year and there are still many challenges that Mr Modi faces in 2018.
