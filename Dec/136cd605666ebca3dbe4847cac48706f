Moi University has handed over the report on interviews to pick a new VC. University Council chairman Jeremiah Ntoloi handed over the report amid an intensifying row on claims of bribery and ethnic bias to block acting VC Laban Ayiro from taking over. Ntoloi declined to comment on the matter. He led several council members to hand over the report and discuss the state of the university with Education CS Fred Matiang’i. “What I know is that the interviews were done and relevant authorities are handling that,” said university communications officer Benard Wandera. There were claims some panelists deliberately gave Ayiro low marks on the basis of his ethnic background in a bid to lock him out.
