locked the door behind them. After locking them in the strong room, the
gangsters collected the money and walked away,” Kimani. He said the bank is not guarded by police like others in the town adding that no
one was hurt during the robbery. The
police, he said, were alerted about the incident by a woman who works at an
adjacent hotel two hours after after the incident. “She
heard noises coming from the direction of the bank and alerted the police.
When our men arrived, the robbers had already left,” said the OCPD. Two
police officers on patrol along the town’s main street were alerted about the robbery and shot in the air on arrival. Eye
witnesses said the officers were not sure if the gangsters were still in the bank
and that they shot in the air to test if the robbers would return fire. Click here for the latest political news
