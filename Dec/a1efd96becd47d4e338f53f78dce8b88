  Fourteen counties in arid and semi-arid regions have been asked to show how Sh200 billion disbursed to them by the national government was spent. Addressing members of the Pastoralists Parliamentary Group during their annual meeting at the Nyali Sun Africa Beach Hotel, Mombasa, on Saturday, National Assembly Majority leader Aden Duale said the money must be accounted for. He urged the 107 MPs and senators to hold their governors accountable. Duale said the narrative that pastoralists are marginalised does not hold water because the 14 counties, among them Garissa, Mandera, Isiolo, Marsabit, Kajiado, have received more money than other counties. “There was a time we could say we are marginalised, but not now. In the first five years of devolution, our 14 counties have received close to Sh200 billion. Can we first account for this money before we start complaining?” Duale said. “We need to do a reassessment and account for the money our 14 counties have received in the past five years. We as MPs also need to [account] for millions we have received through the Constituency Development Fund.” Health and water services remain a big challenge in arid counties.  “In every county, if we build 50 boreholes every year, in five years we would have resolved the water problem by over 50 per cent,” he added. “However, when you go to our counties, water and health are a big issue despite the fact that these two are devolved functions.” Duale said devolution has become a curse rather than a blessing. “Some of us who were in the 10th Parliament fought for devolution because we knew devolution was the best for our people. Five years down the line, devolution has not helped our people,” he said.
