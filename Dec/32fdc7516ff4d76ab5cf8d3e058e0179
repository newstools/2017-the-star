Constitutional lawyer Yash Ghai has asked NASA leader Raila Odinga to refrain from his intended swearing in saying he can be the 'Father of the Nation'. "Raila’s frustration is understandable.

"We should proclaim him as Baba wa Taifa (Father of the Nation), accepted even by those who are not his ardent supporters." Yash said the title will not be an official role but noted that its strength lies in people’s proclamation and acceptance of the role. Read Yash Ghai's article in full
