Majority of domestic tourists going to the coast are booking into apartments, tourism stakeholders in the region say. Since the start of December, many of the hotels are operating at over 75 per cent bed-occupancy, but apartments are at 100 per cent. December is usually a busy month for the tourism sector at the Coast. According to Sam Ikwaye, the Coast executive director of the Kenya Association of Hotelkeepers and Caterers, many apartments are doing well because of “affordability and freedom.” “Apartments are affordable and there is a lot of freedom. The tourists can eat what they want to eat at any time. There is no time table and menus like in many hotels,” said Ikwaye. He said the revelers can invite as many people as possible into the apartment without being charged further, unlike hotels where there are a lot of restrictions. “Apartment is a home away from home,” Ikwaye told the Star. However, according to a domestic tourist who spoke to the Star, the money factor is also a major contributor into their preference. “Majority of the beach hotels charge between Sh10,000 and Sh15,000 per night in their standard rooms. This is per person sharing in most cases,” said Juma Khamis.
