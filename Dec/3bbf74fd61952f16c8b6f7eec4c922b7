The 12th Parliament has worked for only 13 days in three months but will be paid Sh650 million (see story Page 8). The 11th Parliament adjourned early ahead of the August 8 General Election and still got paid in full. But in its first three months that Bunge midwifed Devolution, probed the Sh791 million NYS scandal and introduced bank-interest caps. The four-month-long electoral cycle of the 12th General Election was the longest in Kenyan electioneering history and NASA’s boycott of House proceedings did not help. The people taxed to pay the legislators barely eat three meals a day while MPs and senators live large. Parliament’s timetable is not set in stone. Even in an environment like that of the political impasse, they should have amended it so that they worked like other Kenyans. The Salaries and Remuneration Commission should develop and publicise a detailed Job Description for legislators. Kenyans should get more value for their money than the 12th Parliament has so far offered.
