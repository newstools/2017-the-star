Arts CS Hassan Wario (pictured) on Thursday commissioned a Sh33 million library at Gatimbi, Central Imenti, Meru. He said the library has 6,442 books and e-resources that can be accessed through the internet. The library will have free Wi-Fi. Wario urged youth to use libraries to further their studies.  “In Narok, farmers use the library to know the price of their animals in the market,” he said.  Thirty-three counties have libraries, the CS said. Gatimbi is the fourth library in Meru. Wario was with Lapsett chairman Francis Muthaura and Kenya National Library Services CEO Michael Atuti. He said community libraries will end illiteracy and improve technological advancement.
