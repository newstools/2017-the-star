The Kenya under 19 cricket head coach Jimmy Kamande has tipped his charges to make an impact at the 2018 International Cricket Council (ICC) U-19 World Cup in New Zealand. Kamande observed that the test matches they had against Zimbabwe and Rwanda left them confident ahead of the global showpiece, where Kenya are pooled in Group ‘A’ alongside hosts New Zealand, South Africa and West Indies. “We played test matches against Zimbabwe and Rwanda which boosted our preparations. I hope the boys will go and express themselves and show the world that there is cricket played in Kenya. I have examined their qualities and I am confident two or three of the players will walk into the national team.” He also heaped praises on Namibia-based rookie Rene Were. “He is good player we invited him for trials and he impressed. He brought in new balance on our side, covering for the unavailable players. He is a player I have known for some time and his quality in the team is an advantage for us.” The team is set to jet out tomorrow for warm-up matches in Sydney, Australia before arriving in Christchurch, New Zealand on January 7. While in Australia, the under-19 squad is scheduled to take on local sides Sydney Thunder on January 2 at Punchbowl Oval and Thunder Nation Cup All Stars on January 4 in Rouse Hill.
