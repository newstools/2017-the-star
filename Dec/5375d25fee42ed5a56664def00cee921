Property of unknown value on Tuesday night was reduced to ashes after a fire broke out in a shop in Siaya town.  The 8pm blaze is believed to have been caused by an electric fault.  Witness Helon Oloo said they salvaged a few things.  Calls to firefighters went unanswered.  They arrived late without water. Oloo said Kenya Power responded swiftly. Another witness Chris Okello linked the fire to a rift between the county government and traders.  They had been told to pull down old structures.  Deputy commissioner Joseph Sawe called for calm.
