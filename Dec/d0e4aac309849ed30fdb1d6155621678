The DCI in Lamu county has complained that residents are not swift to report crimes and this makes room for criminals to flee. County DCI officer Moses Yego yesterday said most crimes are reported late when not much can be done. They come when criminals have escaped and even tampered with evidence, he said. “People don’t report crimes promptly when they happen. This has given criminals an upper hand. They do what they want and flee. By the time it’s reported, they are safe wherever they’re,” he said. Yego said the situation makes it difficult for justice to be delivered to victims. Some victims are compromised or even threatened into silence, he said. Yego cited a recent incident in which an 80-year-old man is said to have raped a nine-year-old girl, infected her with HIV and fled. He said the incident was reported late. He warned residents against resolving cases at home whenever crimes are committed. Only a court of law can decide the fate of a criminal, Yego said.
