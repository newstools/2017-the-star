Parties in an election petition challenging the victory of Kisii Senator Sam Ongeri yesterday concluded  their final submissions. Justice Winfridah Okwany will rule on February 5. Ongeri’s win is being challenged by voter Charles Orito. The petitioner claims the August 8 election was not conducted according to the law.  He has listed county returning officer Sidney Namulungu, the IEBC and Ongeri as the first, second and third respondents, respectively. Ombati said they identified 184 polling stations, where the number of votes differed in forms 5B and 5C. He said the votes scored by President and MP differed from those of the senator. Ombati said in Nyamunya polling station, Bobasi, the votes cast for President and MP were 404, but another register indicated the senator got 640. Lawyer Charles Rigoro for the commission and Namulunga, dismissed the petitioner’s claims, saying only one register was used in the election. Representing Ongeri, Okong’o Omogeni said the petitioner’s evidence lacks merit.
