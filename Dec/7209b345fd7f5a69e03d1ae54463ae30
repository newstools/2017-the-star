Masinde Muliro University has shelved plans to award Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli a honorary degree on Friday. The varsity denied claims it was under pressure from the Education ministry of Education to cancel the award on political grounds. Atwoli’s personal assistant Adams Barasa said a member of the University Council called the Cotu boss and complained about intimidation. “A council member told Atwoli the government is not happy with the plan because Atwoli is an opposition supporter,” Barasa said. Atwoli has not received communication about the cancellation, he said. Vice Chancellor Prof Fred Otieno yesterday said Atwoli was to receive a degree of Humane Letters (labour relations).  He referred reporters to the university spokesman to explain the change of plan.  “There is no politics. We had not completed the process for him to be given the degree,” Dr Bob Mbori, the university spokesman, said. Mbori, who is also the convenor of the Honorary Degrees Awards Committee of the university, said the Senate and University Council advised that Atwoli’s degree be given at a future graduation. “The award has been postponed, not cancelled,” Mbori told the Star on the phone. In an advert in a local daily on December 5, the university said it had nominated Atwoli on recommendation of the Senate and the University Council.  “The award is in recognition of Atwoli’s long service and commitment to the national, regional and international trade union leadership,” said part of the statement of his nomination. Human rights activist Ken Wafula said the university should act independently.  “The state should allow the university carry out its mandate without interference,” Wafula said. Mbori, however, denied any interference in the university’s operations. The institution awarded former President Mwai Kibaki a similar honorary degree in 2008 and former athlete Tecla Lorupe in 2009.
