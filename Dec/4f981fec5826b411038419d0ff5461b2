Environment CS Judi Wakhungu yesterday said Kenya has acquired new meteorological equipment to help farmers know when to plant crops. She said farmers have faced frustrations brought about by changes in weather patterns. Wakhungu spoke during the United Nations Environment Assembly — UNEA 3 — in Gigiri, Nairobi. More than 4,000 delegates have attended the event. She said changes in weather patterns complicate farming and has led to crop failures in the past. “With new meteorological equipment in place, farmers will be guided when to plant crops and when not to,” Wakhungu said. She said climate change is mainly to blame for the destruction of the environment. Wakhungu said the government has put in place mitigation measures to tackle the problem. Director of UN Environment’s Economy Division Ligia Noronha said focussing on the quality of growth is key to improving the quality of life. “That requires a culture that supports responsible production. We need to invest differently to transform our economies, and bring in the private sector to back clean growth,” she said.
