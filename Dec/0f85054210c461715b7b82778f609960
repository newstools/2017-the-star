STANLEY NJENGA/  Kiambu Woman representative Gathoni Wamuchomba (pictured left) has called for more measures to mitigate frequent fire outbreaks in villages. Speaking on Monday in Kiambea village, Kiambaa, she said fire incidents had increased in the county, hence the need for more mitigation mechanisms. She was in the area to donate foodstuffs to 35 families whose houses were razed by fire last weekend. “It’s saddening to see frequent fire outbreaks rendering families homeless. We are either careless with our electric devices or some evil spirit is behind the frequent fires,” Wamuchomba said. “I have been to four different places across the county to console fire victims over the last four weekends,” she added. She donated maize, beans and iron sheets to the families to rebuild their houses. The donations were given by the Devolution ministry. Wamuchomba urged President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto to ignore calls to drop or retain some Cabinet Secretaries, saying the two should take time and decide who they think will help them deliver their manifesto to Kenyans.
