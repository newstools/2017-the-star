 Taita Taveta Governor Granton Samboja (pictured) has urged residents to participate in public forums. Speaking in Vighombonyi, Wundanyi, on Sunday, the governor told residents to present their projects’ proposals during public meetings for the County Integrated Development Plan. “We promise to work hard and address the challenges you face, including water, infrastructure, education and health. My government will make sure 30 per cent of tenders go to the youth and women. We have to support you to improve your livelihoods and our economy,” Samboja said. He said the Sh53 million water pipeline connecting Ndi-Mlilo to the main Mzima pipeline is being constructed. It is funded by the national government, through the Coast Water Services Board.  The national government has agreed to release another Sh53 million to connect water from Mlilo to Kishushe.
