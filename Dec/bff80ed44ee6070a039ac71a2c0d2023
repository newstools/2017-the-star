Disputed county boundaries could be altered by a special team if an elected leader or the public successfully petitions the Senate. The passage of a Bill, introduced in Senate, will allow a governor, MCAs or residents to petition senators for boundaries to be corrected to avert conflicts.  Read: Boundaries' disputes a time bomb ahead of polls Makueni Senator Mutula Kilonzo Jr, sponsor of the County Boundaries Bill 2017, argues that formation of a county boundaries mediation committee would help resolve disputes. A petition from the public to the Senate to alter a boundary should be supported by at least 15 per cent of registered voters in the county. The IEBC will help a special Senate committee to ascertain that the petition is backed by the required number of registered voters. A petition by an MCA should be supported by at least two-thirds of county assembly members. Kilonzo, in the Bill tabled last Thursday, criticised the Constitution’s failure to set out county boundaries or cross-refer them to any other law. The Makueni senator said it is only a “matter of notoriety” that the 47 counties and their boundaries are simply districts of Kenya, as envisaged in the Districts and Provinces Act 1992. “Since the promulgation of the Constitution, there have been multiple disputes between counties and on boundary matters,” Kilonzo said. “The Senate has also been called upon by the counties and residents to intervene in such matters in order to comprehensively settle disputes.” There has been a looming conflict between Kirinyaga and Embu counties over the control the 54,000-acre Mwea Trust land.
