Co-operative Bank of Kenya have found themselves in trouble with Kenya Basketball Federation after giving their weekend playoff matches a wide berth. Co-op Bank’s men’s side were scheduled to play a semifinal duel against champions Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) at Upper Hill School. The ladies side was to play champions Equity Bank. KBF fixtures secretary Joseph Amoko said Co-op had requested that the matches be shelved since they had not trained sufficiently due to lack of a suitable venue. However, the request was turned down as the governing body issued walk-overs against the absentees. KPA were awarded a walk over on a 20-0 basis while Equity moved to the finals. “The Co-op ladies team will have to write to the league and competitions committee explaining why they never showed up,” said a visibly disappointed Amoko. In the only match played, World Hope beat Barclays Bank 81-71 to bag promotion to the Premier League. Vincent Majimbo tallied 15 points as Maurice Obilo and Conrad Wafula added 14 and 11 respectively for World Hope, who will now meet Kisumu Lakeside in the lower division finals. Veteran Mike Lopokoiyit nailed game high 26 points and Franklin Delano had 10 for the bankers.
