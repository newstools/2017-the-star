Two men have been arrested by police in Lari
constituency for allegedly gang-raping a 32-year-old woman on the Christmas Eve. Lari police boss Isaiah Odhiambo yesterday said the woman was raped on December 24 at midnight by five men, as she was going home from Kamburu trading
centre. He said a gang of five men armed with
crude weapons ambushed her as she was opening her house. “Before she entered, the gang caught up with her and ordered her not
scream,” Odhiambo said. Odhiambo says they took her to Kamburu Primary School, where they raped
her in turns. “The woman’s plea for mercy fell on deaf ears,” he said. Odhiambo said after the ordeal, the woman screamed and
neighbours came took her to Githunguri Subcounty Hospital. She was referred to Kiambu County Hospital.   The woman was discharged from hospital on Monday. Odhiambo said the incident was reported that night and
police visited the scene and collected her torn clothes. “We started investigations that led us to the two
suspects. We are hunting for the other three,” he said. Kiambu Woman Representative Gathoni Wamuchomba urged women not to walk alone at night. “It is important to be in the company of several people if
you have to walk at night,” she said.
