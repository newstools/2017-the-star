Security officers in the Linda Boni Operation want President Uhuru Kenyatta and acting Interior CS Fred Matiang’i to intervene and have them paid their more than six months hardship allowances. The officers yesterday said their efforts to raise the matter with their bosses haven’t borne fruit as they keep taking them in circles and threaten to have them fired. Those yet to be paid operate in Bar’goni, Bodhei, Milimani, Mararani, Mangai, Basuba, Kiunga, Ishakani and Mokowe. The officers want Uhuru and Matiang’i to visit their camps and help resolve the issue, which “is dampening our spirits”. But operation boss Joseph Kanyiri dismissed the officers’ claims that they have yet to get their hardship allowances. The officers are lying because the allowances were only delayed, but had been disbursed to their bank accounts, he said. A Recce officer said it was disheartening and discouraging to put their lives on the line daily to fight al Shabaab and secure Lamu, yet their bosses refuse to honour their part of the bargain. He said their morale will be boosted if they get “what we deserve”.
