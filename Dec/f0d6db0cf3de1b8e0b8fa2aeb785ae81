Adelle Onyango has been flying the Kenyan flag high. Last week,
she had the privilege of meeting the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate
Middleton, who was really into finding out what content is coming out of
Kenya, if we faced the same challenges as them in terms of content
regulation for children, telling our own stories, and if we had any
solutions they could borrow from us. Adelle was
really nervous, but she was happy the Duke and Duchess of
Cambridge are interested in content for Generation U. This
must have been an amazing opportunity, and speaking to Word Is, she
shared the lesson she learnt from attending and speaking at the summit in London. "There’s
a bigger world full of so many possibilities and thirsty for the
digital content I make. Sometimes when we get caught up in the bubble that is our country, we forget." One topic she discussed during the summit was cyberbullying. When asked
if she feels people are now more aware of the dangers of cyberbullying,
she said, "Definitely. The panel I was part of was discussing that and
was extremely vibrant, with views from different corners of the world, but
they all echoed the same sentiment, that it’s time to tame that
monster." Adding, "I don’t think the
title has led to experiences, per se. Because I created Brunch with
Adelle right after being named one of the 100 [BBC Women], but that was my effort and
creation. Also, going to the summit was based on loud conversations on
cyberbullying I’ve had online that caught the organisers' attention."
