Health stakeholders in Homa Bay county will educate people along the beaches of Lake Victoria on the effects of HIV-Aids. This is aimed at ending the high prevalence of the scourge in the county. According to the Kenya Aids Strategic Framework Survey, the county tops in HIV-Aids prevalence at 25.7 per cent. It is followed by Siaya at 23.7 per cent, Kisumu at 19.3 per cent and Migori at 14.7 per cent. County deputy director of health Kevin Osuri on Friday said areas along the beaches are the worst-hit. Osuri said despite fishing being a major economic activity in the county, it has brought with it the high spread of the virus. “We are making significant strides in reducing the high rates by forming a team of stakeholders, targetting the fishing sector,” he said. Charlotte Ong’ang’a, a lecturer at Jaramogi Oginga Odinga University of Science and Technology, said most women and girls have been forced to have sexual liaison with fishermen in exchange of fish for sale.
