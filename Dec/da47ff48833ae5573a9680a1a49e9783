President Uhuru Kenyatta’s planned overhaul of the Cabinet Secretaries and Principal Secretaries’ lineup will not be derailed by Parliament’s adjournment for a long recess next week. MPs yesterday approved a motion moved by Deputy Majority chief whip Cecily Mbarire seeking to alter the House calendar and have the adjournment pushed from today to December 14. Mbarire said the seven days extension would help them conclude the election of nine representatives to the East African Legislative Assembly as well as constitute parliamentary committees.

Kindiki said lawmakers will be recalled for a special sitting to iron out the matter and ensure the President has a strong team to help him develop the nation during his second and final term. “If the President finds it needful to have his CSs and PSs vetted during the recess, Parliament will be recalled through the right procedure. I don’t rule out the possibility of special sitting because the country cannot wait until February next year for this crucial process to commence,” Kindiki said.
