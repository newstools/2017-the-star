Kajiado Governor Joseph Ole Lenku yesterday TV advertisements seeking buyers for such plots in the county are works of conmen. "We cannot issue titles for those plots. Those titles alleged to be from us are fraudulently acquired," said Lenku. The Governor now says members of public must beware the sale of plots in rural Kajiado is banned saying they will be losing their money. "We are declaring that those plots are a scheme of unscrupulous traders. Such sizes can only be available in urban centres," he said.   The Governor was speaking during the launch of the county's spatial plan meant to guide in developments of various sectors and especially land, housing and road network at Maasai Technical Training Institute.  He pointed out that areas along Kiserian -Magadi road, Kitengela-Isinya-Kiserian road and Isinya-Namanga roads as heavily infested by such “misinformed” plot buyers. "We have zoned off the county so that land meant for agriculture and ranching can remain for that use," he said. The National Land Commission immediately lauded Lenku's fears and said the cartel operation had reached alarming levels. NLC Vice Chairman Abigael Mbagaya said the order to monitor sale of small plots was timely. "We are very worried at the rate people are buying land that can't be productive for anything. It must be stopped," said Mbagaya, who was in attendance.
