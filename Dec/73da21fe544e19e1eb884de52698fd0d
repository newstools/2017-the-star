When he joined the military in 2015 as a cadet officer, 25-year-old Roy Munene was ecstatic that he was finally pursuing his dream career. His ambition and zeal made his mother believe he would fit in the shoes of his late father, who died seven years ago. But two months to his graduation, Munene disappeared without a trace, and with him his dreams of serving in the military. He was to graduate last month in a ceremony graced by President Uhuru Kenyatta. Munene went missing on September 24 at Mt Kenya, where he was attending his last field training. He joined the Kenya Military Academy in Lanet in September 2015, had completed a bachelor’s degree in Military Science and had been commissioned to graduate. His disappearance has left his family in agony and tears, wondering what could have happened to him. The military has not given answers on what could have happened to Munene. His family says in the last 67 days, they have been taken round in circles. Mother Mary Amatu yesterday told the Star she has been spending sleepless nights. A tearful Amatu has appealed to the President to intervene and help unravel the mystery of her son’s disappearance. “If my son was to abandon the training, he would have done so at the beginning. He was passionate and wanted to serve in the military. He had endured a lot to give up at the finish line,” she said. Munene’s colleague, who sought anonymity, said he had been punished before he disappeared. He said Munene was not in good terms with one of the trainers. Munene had alleged the officer assaulted him, leaving him with a back injury and a fractured hand. KDF spokesman Col David Obonyo yesterday said the family has always been updated on the search operation and this would continue. “Search teams were deployed to the area and have been there ever since. The family was also briefed in a meeting held last week,” Obonyo said. Click here for the latest political stories
