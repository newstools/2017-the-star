Khaligraph Jones is running this industry, if what
he told Word Is is anything to go by.Â  "Next
year, it's gonna be Khaligraph Jones on a larger scale because you will
see from January the videos that I'm gonna be releasing are not going to be
something that Kenyans have ever seen before. I'm just taking it to
another level." He'll feature local and
international artistes, but he is not ready to reveal who they are yet.
He is also planning to do his shoots in other countries, like Nigeria, Tanzania and South Africa. By
the end of this year, hopefully end of December, he is going to put out
his new album that he has been wanting to release for a long time.
