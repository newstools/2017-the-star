Betting  and gaming firms  suffered a major blow yesterday after the High Court dismissed their  legal bid to  nullify a law that will raise the tax rate on gambling. The tax hike that imposes a tax of 35 per cent of gross profits on all gambling is now set to take effect on Monday. Justice John Mativo said the Betting, Lotteries and Gambling Act was properly enacted, hence constitutional. Pevan East Africa Limited, the owner of Sportpesa, and Bradley Limited that runs the Pambazuka National Lottery moved to court separately, claiming the tax hikes – which replaced variable tax rates on betting, gaming, lottery and sweepstakes — were unconstitutional.  They said Parliament approved it without public participation. They also asked the court to overturn the law, saying the rate is high and unreasonable.
