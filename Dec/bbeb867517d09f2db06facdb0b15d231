Nyamira returning officer David Towett on Wednesday told the High court that Governor John Nyagarama was validly elected on August 8. Towett, while being cross-examined by Nyagarama's lawyer Nyagaka Nyachiro, said no excess votes were used to declare his client the winner. However, he contradicted himself when he told the court that no complaint was made over the governor race. On Tuesday, the lawyer admitted that Walter Nyambati - the petitioner - had complained to him in writing over the mess which was detected at Kebabe tallying centre in North Mugirango constituency. Towett said the errors committed during the transfer of data from forms 37A to 37B and 37C did not affect the outcome. The returning officer further denied allegations by the petitioner that the recruitment of county officers as presiding officers in some polling stations was a calculated move to rig in Nyagarama. On bribery allegations against the Governor, Towett told the court none of the candidates had complained or raised the allegations with him. He said those employed as presiding officers were drawn from all departments on condition that they were qualified to work as polling officials. The lawyer said the appointments were not through political influence as claimed by the petitioner. He also denied claims that agents of the petitioner were denied access to the Kebabe tallying centre where the petitioner claims results were tampered with. The hearing will continue on December 20.
