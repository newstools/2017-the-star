Police police are looking for a man who allegedly assaulted his 14-year-old niece in the name of discipline. The orphaned teenager, who wrote her KCPE examinations this year, was first attacked on December 11. Remo sub-location assistant chief William Jabedo said the incidents persisted forcing neighbours to raise the alarm. “She was assaulted, beaten up and burnt on the leg with hot iron before she was left for dead at her grandmother’s home,” Jobedo told journalists on Wednesday. The girl was treated at Ogwedhi Dispensary and later transferred to Migori County Referral Hospital, where she is responding well to treatment. Seth Midenyo, the director of NGO Smiling Child, said the matter was reported after more than 10 days. “She was sick. Her lower limbs had septic wounds with puss and maggots. It was by luck that we saved her,” Midenyo said. Jane Adhiambo, a human rights activist, called for help from well-wishers so the girl continues studying. The suspect fled but Jobedo said he will be found and taken to court. “He will face charges of assault. Villagers are helping police with investigations." Click here for the latest political news
