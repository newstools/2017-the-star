The dismal performance in the agriculture sector is caused by poor
coordination between the national and county governments, an expert has said. James
Nyoro, Kiambu Deputy Governor, and agriculture economist yesterday said in the absence of proper harmonisation, each arm of government does its own things. He was speaking during a conference on transforming agriculture for inclusive growth and sustainable livelihoods at the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development. The meeting was organised by Tegemeo Institute of Agricultural Policy and Development of Egerton University.   The former food security advisor to President Uhuru Kenyatta said Kenya has not had an inclusive strategy on how the sector should be managed to guarantee food security of the growing population. “Both the
national and county governments have not developed a comprehensive
master plan to stimulate growth in the sector,” he said. Nyoro noted
that many developed countries that have succeeded in agriculture transformation
have invested in well-developed strong master plans. He added that they have
also equally facilitated favorable operating environment mainly reducing cost
of production. “There are
plan by value chain players to establish the master plan, which will highlight
the role of each county in the value chain. The plan will also focus on the
comparative advantage each county is endowed with. This will help in making a
decision in investments both by the governments and private sector,” said
Nyoro. Dr Johnson
Irungu, the director of crop resources at the Ministry of Agriculture said the
agriculture landscape is changing hence the need to ensure inclusivity to
transform the sector.  “The food
gap is still increasing and the large gap between potential and current crop
yields provides a big opportunity for increasing food production. Food security
remains a key challenge in the country, it is the elephant in the room and we
must find a way to be food secure,” he said.
