The Cecafa Senior Challenge Cup Group ‘B’ matches resume today at Bukhungu Stadium, Kakamega County with a top of the table clash between Ethiopia and Burundi set to catch the eye of the enthusiastic locals. Speaking from their training camp at Kakamega High School, Ethiopian tactician Ashenafi Bekele revealed that they are expecting a tough match against Burundi who are also favourites from the group. “Burundi are very good in defending and dangerous on first breaks. Our players will need to be on the alert and remain focused. Burundi also have individual players who can cause trouble if given room to operate but we have what it takes to handle them,”  Bekele said during a training session. “We have no serious injury concerns apart from some few knocks that we picked in our first match against Southern Sudan but we have since recovered,” he added. Team captain Bune Butako made it known that they intent to finish at the top of the group as they look forward to the knockout stages. “Our match against Burundi will be like a final for us. We want to finish at the top of the group and wait for the knock out stage,” Butako pointed out.  Burundi, who are also training at Kakamega High School under coach Oliever Nuyengeko, are wary of the talented and skilful Ethiopia side who together with Uganda are the favourites in Group ‘B’. “Playing against Ethiopia who are four-time title winners of this tournament is not easy but we are well prepared for the match,” said Nuyungeko. Ethiopia, who opened their campaign on a bright note by beating South Sudan 3-0, will be relying on experienced defender Tediros Bekele Meta, attacking midfielder Abdela Abubeker and striker Tilahun Abel Yalew who grabbed a brace in the opening match.
