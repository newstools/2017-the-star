Wajir Department of Water Nominee has vowed to restore the dignity of the county's water towers if given the chance to serve. The 38 year old Yusuf Dayib on Saturday told the vetting committee he is well blessed to serve Wajir residents in the provision of the precious commodity in the region which receives less rainfall annually.

He said to date, the town has a full blown water scarcity with countless boreholes drilling exercise yielding no fruit. "There are over 400 settlements in Wajir County with over 157 of them depending on water trucking it's time we engage in new innovative methods like investing heavily on mega piping projects from boreholes with ample yield and water harvesting projects for it to be sustainable", Dayib said. He said with the help of County Governor Mohammed Abdi and the entire Wajir leadership he will undertake in protecting and restoring the six water towers that recharge the aquifer that is now damaged or blocked by human activities which has disrupted the natural water drainage system.
