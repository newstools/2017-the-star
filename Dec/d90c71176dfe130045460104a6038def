President Uhuru Kenyatta has commended the KDF for its commitment to keeping Kenya safe and its dedication to the war on terrorism. He also applauded the KDF for remaining steadfast in its mission to bring lasting peace and development to the region. “Our nation is today faced with security challenges posed by terrorists and extremist groups whose fighting capabilities are being curtailed by our forces in different arenas, including Somalia,” Uhuru said.

This was Uhuru’s first official function outside Nairobi after his inauguration on Tuesday. He said terrorists have tried to create division, hatred and fear among Kenyans, but have failed. “Kenya today is more firmly united in the fight against terror than at any time in all our history,” Uhuru said. He urged all Kenyans to be alive to the fact terrorism cannot be defeated by military might alone. The prosperity of Kenya depends on how peace, security, governance and sound economic development policies are brought to act on each other for the advancement of society, Uhuru said.
