When the Kenyan-born Hollywood star Edi Gathegi walked the streets of Eastlands, he never knew it would one day contribute to his ‘screen career’. Gathegi, who was born and partly brought up in Umoja Estate, Nairobi, says the tough life was characterised by crime and trouble. In an exclusive interview with the Star on Wednesday, Gathegi who was in Kenya for the Christmas break, says he was forced to toughen up and adapt to life in the hood. Gathegi attributes his early life to the ‘badass’ character he has portrayed in some of his films: The Blacklist ( 2015 to present), Start Up ( 2016 to present) and The Blacklist Redemption ( 2017 ), among others. “Being brought up in Eastlands is one of the most amazing things in my life. I actually got to learn a lot about life and...humanity. I also toughened up and had to have a voice to survive.” Despite his successful career Gathegi knows what is is like to not only push the glass ceiling in a tight competitive market, but also being black and without a remarkable name in Hollywood. “Being black and without a name means you have to work twice as hard as everyone else and at probably half the pay but it is only hardwork and determination that pays at the end of it all.” The star holds his Kenyan counterpart Lupita Nyongo in high esteem for representing the country in the international platform. “I always appreciate hardwork and the fact that Lupita is in Hollywood I know what it takes to be there. That said, if you celebrate Edi then you have to celebrate Lupita because at the end of the day we are all Kenyans and when our star shines, it give glory to Kenya.” His latest works include Jesus Hopped the ‘A’ Train, a play about religion, and Jay-Z’s Legacy. He is working in Start Up season 3 so, watch out folks.
