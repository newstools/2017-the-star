 Thirty-five students on Thursday graduated with certificates from a vocational training institute that equips Mombasa youth with skills to improve their livelihoods. They obtained certificates in tailoring and dressmaking, computer literacy skills, catering and storekeeping. Wema Centre programmes coordinator Henry Bineah said they enrolled more than 2,000 youth to learn skills to earn a living. “We give priority to the less fortunate people like orphans and those who dropped out of school because of early pregnancies and marriages,” Bineah said.  Education history, age, family background and social economic levels are some of the factors considered before one is recruited. Village elders, the county department of youth and civil society organisations are also consulted.  The beneficiaries then receive an 11-month training before they graduate with certificates. With a population of 1,217,920 people, Mombasa has a poverty level of 33.5 per cent. Apart from aiming to reduce the poverty level, the Wema Centre is also involved in campaigns against drug abuse, helping street families, addressing malnutrition and supporting those living with HIV-Aids. Bineah said they will introduce more courses next year.  They will include talents in acting, singing and hairdressing, Bineah said.
