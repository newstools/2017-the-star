 The United States has called for the immediate and open national dialogue between President Uhuru Kenyatta and NASA leader Raila Odinga for peace. US President Donald Trump congratulated President Uhuru and Deputy President William Ruto on their inauguration but appealed for talks. The super power is pushing for national dialogue to heal the nation after months of divisive politics.

Namwamba said the congratulatory message could have been channeled without recommending for dialogue. He said the political contestation was settled after the October 26 polls and the swearing-in ceremony.  “The call by the US to steer Kenya towards a direction they do not prescribe for themselves is insincere. Its call to dialogue in the midst of a settled political contestation is disingenuous,” Namwamba said.  “This is considering that a healing dialogue did not ensue following Trump’s disputed November 2016 victory. The council takes great exception to this and condemns it with the weight of the inherent duplicity in the statement”. Click here for the latest political stories
