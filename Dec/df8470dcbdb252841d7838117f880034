President Uhuru Kenyatta has assumed office after his
swearing-in. He faces a tough battle uniting the country. The priority at the
moment is to appoint the new Cabinet. When he took over in 2013, he appointed
technocrats as Cabinet Secretaries and later brought in politicians. While some
of the CSs have performed very well, others have failed miserably, both
technocrats and politicos.  As he appoints the new CSs, the country expects him to choose
competent and hard-working people from diverse backgrounds representing the
Face of Kenya. This team should help him execute the vision he outlined on
Tuesday. These men and women must be people of integrity and who are
willing to go beyond the call of duty in delivering on this mandate. This is
because the President is likely to have only the next two years to secure his
legacy before succession politics take centre stage.  How President Uhuru will be remembered will depend mainly
on the period between now and December 2019. His choice of Cabinet Secretaries,
and how they perform, will be all-important.
