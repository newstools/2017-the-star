Kenya coach Paul Odera has set his sights on World Cup qualification during next year’s Africa Under-20 event in Namibia. Odera said they are in better shape than last year when they lost to Namibia 61-24 in the final. “We are in a better place as compared to 2016 because we have a bigger group of older players who have experience working with us. The plan is to get us to recognize the systems and for the players to see where they are in terms of conditioning,” noted Odera. Kenya face Zimbabwe in the semi-final in March next year with the winner facing either Namibia or Madagascar in the final, where the U-20 South Zone title will be up for grabs. The South zone winner will then face the North zone counterparts for the overall African title, and with it qualification to the 2018 World Rugby Junior Trophy which is the second tier of global competition at that level. Odera admitted that they have few challenges ahead of the tournament. “The biggest challenge for us at the moment is balancing the players’ club and national team commitments. That’s what we are trying to do and make sure they stay in shape. It’s going to be quite hectic from this month because there is the Kenya Cup going on. There are some players who are abroad, those players in school and those with other personal commitments. We are looking to see if we can get players in at least every two weeks in January and most of the weekends in February. That is the plan in terms of developing how we are going to play.” He added With a healthy sprinkling of new call ups in the squad, Odera said: “Some of the players who have come in are looking very good. It is good for us because when we have more competition, the quality of players’ development gets better,” he noted. Odera made the remarks after the team conducted a four-day training camp in Gilgil, which attracted 35 players.
