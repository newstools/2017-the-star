National Lands Commission chairman Muhammad Swazuri has criticised Machakos police for carrying out land evictions using fake court orders. Swazuri said the Department of Criminal Investigations should investigate and verify court orders before police effect evictions on disputed land. “There are people who move to court for orders to defeat justice. There are many fake court orders,” Swazuri said. He attended a meeting on controversial colonial land at Ngelani in Mavoko, Machakos county, on Thursday. Swazuri said the police should stop effecting such orders and instead protect the residents from professional land grabbers. Land grabbers forge court rulings and judgments. “There are many professional land grabbers who can make fake court orders look professional and genuine,” he added. “People write fake rulings and judgments themselves. If you call the magistrates whose names appear on the documents, they disown the documents.” The NLC chairman urged Machakos county commissioner Matilda Sakwa to protect residents from such criminals. Sakwa admitted that there are many fake orders and title deeds in Machakos county. “There are many problems in Machakos. Fake orders, title deeds, everything is fake,” she said. Sakwa said the county security teams will vet all court orders before police effect evictions. “Subcounty security teams will vet and verify the authenticity of the orders. Only genuine ones will be used by the police,” she said. Sakwa said they will not disturb residents unless there are genuine orders. Sakwa said land issues have created insecurity in Machakos county. She said the commission should resettle genuine squatters from the county on free land to end land related crime.
