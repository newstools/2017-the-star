The government has called for concerted efforts to deal with street children and their families. This came as it emerged that the number of street children in urban centres is on the rise with women and young children being the most affected. According to Dr Leonard Ngaithe from the department of Special Programmes, there is need to bring all stakeholders on board to help move the families off the streets. Ngaithe said working towards providing a good quality of life to the most vulnerable members of the society is a commitment the government pledged to undertake. He said many institutions involved in the rehabilitation of street children will continue to be assisted to address the issue. “It is important to ensure we address the street families phenomenon before it explodes to unmanageable levels,” Ngaithe said. He continued, “We should go further to explore and develop traditional coping mechanisms and use social capital to ensure that the issue does not spiral out of control.”
