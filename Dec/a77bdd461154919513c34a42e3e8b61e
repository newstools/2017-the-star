A task force formed by Nandi Governor Stephen Sang has found pending bills of Sh1.3 billion for 656 projects initiated by the former regime.  The report recommends that 12 top county officials be interdicted and questioned over the malpractices that led to the huge debts. “This is a serious situation. We will do our best to remove this burden from the people of Nandi,” Governor Sang told the Star yesterday. The task force report will be submitted to the county assembly for possible allocation of cash to settle legitimate bills. There are double claims by contractors for Sh210 million for 66 projects and for six non-existing projects amounting to Sh21 million. The task force established that unsatisfactory claims amounted to Sh676 million for 330 projects, while claims that need further verification amount to Sh416 million for 254 projects. Sang mandated the team to establish genuine bills and determine the status of procuring goods and services. The task force is also expected to recommend solutions. The report indicates funds carried forward from the 2016-17 to 2017-18 financial year by the county government was Sh759 million, according to bank balance details dated July 24. Out of the money, Sh142 million was conditional grants from Road Maintenance Levy Fund and the Tea Levy. The balance of Sh617 million is for settling properly audited pending bills. “The report has glaring revelations of misuse and misappropriation of public fund,” Sang said. More than 50 companies are accused of forwarding fraudulent claims.  The task force said guidance should be sought from the office of the Attorney General on the process of assets recovery from the concerned companies and staff, as well as disciplinary measures to be taken against them. The report also revealed marginalisation of the youth, women and people living with disabilities, since a select group of contractors consistently won the contracts.
