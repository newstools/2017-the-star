The top secondary school principal in the country in 2017 has attributed her success to a good foundation and hard work. There was pomp and colour inWaregi village, Uriri subcounty, as Sister Anastasia Amollo organised a homecoming party after winning this year’s Principal of the Year Award. The St Mary’s Lwak Girls’ High School principal floored other principals to win the award presented during the Kenya Secondary Schools Heads’ Association Conference held in Mombasa in June. She also received the Head of State Commendation during Jamhuri Day celebration on December 12. “Hard work. Don’t fear work. I would not have won this award if it was not for hard work,” she said. Amollo said the spirit of hard work was instilled in her by her father, who never entertained laziness among his children. “When we were young, we had to wake up early and every one had to do his or her bit before going to school,” Amollo said. The celebration started with Mass. The principal was showered with gifts from residents.  The 2016 winner was Emining Boys High School, Baringo, principal Solomon Koech. “I began my teaching career at Koru Girls. I worked in various schools before coming to Lwak Girls as a principal,” she said. Amollo began her winning streak at subcounty level, where she overcame challenges to clinch the top prize. This involved a PowerPoint presentation, interview by a panel of professionals alongside outlining her achievements in curricular and extra -curricular activities at her school. The Catholic Schools Principals’ Association in Homa Bay Diocese led by the chairman and principal of Asumbi Teachers’ Training College, Maurice Ndolo, commended KESSHA for awarding school heads for their hard work.
