Kenyan players posted mixed results as the hunt for titles intensified at the ongoing Eastern Region Championship at the Complexe Sportiff de Beau Basin in Mauritius. The Kenyan pair of Sejal Thakkar and Sandra Nyaga lost 3-2 to neighbours Uganda despite taking a 2-0 while Josiah Wandera and Bryan Mutua whipped Madagascar 3-0. The loss to Uganda means Thakkar and Nyaga can finish the tournament with a bronze medal while Wandera and Mutua are assured of a silver. Wandera and Mutua treated the Mauritius crowd to some exhilarating displays of ping pong artistry to reach the doubles final. “Standards have now been set and only the sky is the limit,” said Josiah Wandera, who picked himself up from his initial day one errors to pull through in awesome fashion. Bryan has been the toast of the Kenya team in Mauritius with his determined and calculated attacks. The Kenyans’ defence also improved immensely compared to their shaky start the previous day. “I can’t wait to lay my hands on the coveted gold, although a silver is assured regardless of the outcome,” said Mutua, a prodigy of Mwala production line and the best Kenyan league player of 2017. Having already taken some impressive scalps on Day Two, Kenyans can no longer be taken lightly. Click here for the latest political news
