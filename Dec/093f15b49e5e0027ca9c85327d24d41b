Cases of violent robberies, murder and high consumption of illicit alcohol have increased in Eldoret, Governor Jackson Mandago has said. Mandago said other parts of Uasin Gishu county have also recorded high crime rates. He blamed security agencies for laxity and asked IG Joseph Boinnet to investigate reports that police officers may be working with criminals. “The reports we are receiving show a very high number of robberies and thefts both in towns and rural areas,” Mandago said. Speaking at his office on Tuesday, he warned he will not tolerate laxity among government workers as residents suffer. “I have received a lot of complaints from residents and I have asked the IG to deal with the matter of insecurity urgently,” Mandago said. Mandago spoke after meeting representatives of people living with disabilities. He also warned that he will sack county executives who try to sabotage his work through non-performance. The Governor reiterated that he wants to leave a good legacy at the end of his second term. County executives are key to the delivery of promises, he said and noted they will be held responsible for any failures in their dockets. "This time round, everyone has to do his/her work. If the county assembly recalls any of you for non-performance, I will approve that," he said, adding those who feel unable to work "will be free to resign and go home". Mandago further said executives will be assessed every three months and that they must engage the public on a daily basis instead of sitting in county offices. "If I go out there and discover people do not know you as a county executive, that will be an automatic ticket to sacking you because it will show your are not in touch with residents," he said. The new county executives were sworn-in last week. Read: Perform or be sacked, Mandago warns Uasin Gishu CECs after swearing-in Click here for the latest political stories
