Uasin Gishu is yet to fully enforce the ban on plastic bags because sensitisation must be completed. Environment director Boniface Birichi said NEMA has not arrested anyone there because they have given the public more time to make changes. Birichi added the authority will consult Kenya Bureau of Statistics and manufacturers so more alternatives can be supplied. “Increasing the availability of the alternative bags will automatically lower the buying cost,” he said.  A spot-check by The Star in Eldoret and its environs found vendors using old newspapers to wrap products. Those interviewed said they were aware of the dangers of wrapping meat, for example, in these papers but said they could not risk disregarding the law. “We can’t risk using the banned plastic bags because the punishments are harsh. Where will I get the millions to set myself free should I be arrested?” said Josephine Jelagat who sells vegetables. Bosco Kibet who carried vegetables in newspapers said he could not complain because he understood the challenges that followed the ban. “The alternative bags are expensive and not everybody can afford them, especially not poor people." Those found using plastic bags will pay the fine of between Sh2 million and Sh4 million, or serve a jail term of between one and two years. The NEMA official said they will swing into action soon after they are satisfied with the extent of sensitisation. “We will deploy our enforcement team which will work with police and the county security team for full implementation of the ban,” said Birichi.
