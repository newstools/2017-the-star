The Luo Council of Elders recognises Uhuru Kenyatta as President. “Kenyatta is the President of everybody in Kenya. I call on him to consider the Luo, like other communities, in jobs and national resources distribution,” chairman Nyandiko Ongadi said. Last Thursday Suba South MP John Mbadi was kicked out of the National Assembly Chamber for failing to recognise Uhuru as President. Speaker Justin Muturi ordered Mbadi to withdraw his remark, but he was adamant. “There is no President in this country to make appointments. I would rather withdraw from the Chamber than withdraw the remark,” Mbadi said. But the elders asked Uhuru not to treat Luos as rebels and include them in his government. “Political rivalry is normal in a democratic country like Kenya. Let President Kenyatta and his Jubilee leadership work with all communities,” Ongadi said. He and executive committee members from the four Nyanza counties addressed the press in Kendu Bay town on Saturday. Ongadi said Luos should not be denied government appointments because of the political rivalry between Uhuru and NASA leader Raila Odinga.  The elders were Peter Mbogo (Migori), Phoebe Akinyi (Siaya) and Homa Bay secretary Joram Okola. They urged  the community not to brand as rebels government appointees. “Anybody appointed for a state job from this community should take that opportunity to develop Kenyans. We don’t want to hear anybody being referred to as a traitor,” Okola said.  Mbogo said Nyanza lags behind and it is time for a change in attitude. “Rejecting a government officer is tantamount to rejecting development projects which the government should offer the people,” he said. The elders called for a reconciliation of all communities.
