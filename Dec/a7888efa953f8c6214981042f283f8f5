The government of Kitui has been asked to fence all earth dams in the county to curb cases of drowning by residents who go to swim in them. Kitui West politician Mutiso Leli on Sunday urged Governor Charity Ngilu to fence off all dams in the region to prevent children from drowning. "There is need to also have people watch over the dams, especially now that schools are closed," Leli said. The two had met at Kwa-Mulungu dam in Kitui West, where a 16-year-old boy drowned on Friday. Ngilu and Leli had joined residents as they waited for divers and Red Cross officials to retrieve the body of Kyale Mwongelas. Divers had failed to find the body, two days after the boy drowned, forcing Ngilu to visit the scene and observe the retrieval efforts. Led by Kenya Red Cross projects manager Kioko Kiilu, the divers went back to the water and found Mwongales body after 30 minutes of searching. The body was stuck in mud at the base of the dam. Ngilu had promised not to leave the scene until the body was retrieved. She had also promised cash rewards to the divers. The body was put in a waiting police vehicle and taken to Kitui Level Four Hospital mortuary. Addressing residents after the search mission, Ngilu blamed lack of local expertise for delayed retrieval. She said the county will set up an emergency unit to act immediately whenever disaster occurs. “The draft Bill to set up a 24-hour emergency unit is ready,” Ngilu said. Kitui West administrator Peninnah Nzile said Mwongelas drowned during a swimming expedition with friends. "He was in a group of five boys who were cultivating a nearby farm and decided to go swimming after a hard day's work," Nzile said. She said the boy developed an abrupt exhaustion and was too heavy for a friend who tried to rescue him. "The friend had to let him go because he was too heavy," Nzile added.
