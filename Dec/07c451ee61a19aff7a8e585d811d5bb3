Mwingi Central MP Gideon Mulyungi yesterday said the first ever goat auction in Kitui county that took place on Saturday netted about Sh3 million. He said the outcome was encouraging. Mulyungi spoke in Mwingi, where they took stock of the event, which took place at Nguni market in his constituency. He expressed joy that residents responded well. The goat auction only used to happen in Baringo under the leadership of President Daniel Moi. Now it has happened in Ukambani and profitted farmers a lot, the legislator said. “The rains have failed, but this can be a food security supplement. In Ukambani, we don’t rely so much on rain. The rains are never enough. Our farmers put so much effort into planting, but harvest nothing. They undergo a very big loss,” Mulyungi said. He urged farmers not to rely on crop growing alone, but adopt livestock farming so they don’t suffer in case of droughts.
