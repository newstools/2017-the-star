Zimbabwe's new President Emmerson
Mnangagwa on Thursday called for the removal of Western
sanctions on his government during a speech to ruling party
officials and said elections due in 2018 were nearer than "you
expect". Mnangagwa, 75, became leader of the southern African nation
last month after the military and ruling ZANU-PF turned against
Robert Mugabe who had ruled the country for 37 years and was
seen grooming his wife Grace to succeed him.
