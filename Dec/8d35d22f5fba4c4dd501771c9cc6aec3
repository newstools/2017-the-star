The High court on Friday struck out a petition challenging Trans Nzoia Governor Patrick Khaemba's list of CEC nominees. In his ruling, Justice Anthony Mrima of the Kitale High court said that the petition filed by William Andiema and Gregory Ngeiwa was premature. "This goes without saying that the petitioners still have a perfect opportunity to present their grievances before county assembly." Among issues the petitioners raised was that youths, who are majority in the county, were not nominated as all proposed CECs are above 35 years. They also claimed that the Iteso community have never been represented since the inception of devolution in 2013. The judge further said he has considered the issue as a matter of public interest citing that unless the county executive committee is in place, the executive authority of the county cannot be exercised. "The county government will not be able to discharge any of its function to the public," he said. Justice Mrima said that the application lacked merit hence dismissed it with cost. Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa lauded the court for striking out the petition saying the case has delayed the county's development plan. He urged the county assembly speaker Joshua Werunga to call for a special sitting in order to debate and approve the names.
