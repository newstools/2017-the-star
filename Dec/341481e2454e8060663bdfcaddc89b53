Farmers in Laikipia West subcounty have been cautioned against selling their harvest at throwaway prices as there will be a dry spell early next year. They received a bumper harvest after the short rains. National Drought Management Authority Coordinator Henry Mustafa on Saturday said the region is the only one in the entire county that had a good harvest. He said the government will not feed them if they do not manage their grains. Mustafa said residents in the arid Laikipia North and parts of Laikipia Central will receive relief food in February.
