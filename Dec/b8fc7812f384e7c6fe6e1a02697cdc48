A group of Nyandarua leaders have urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to reappoint Public Service CS Sicily Kariuki in his new Cabinet. They are Governor Francis Kimemia, Woman Representative Faith Gitau, speaker Wahome Ndegwa, Senator Githiomi Mwangi and Ol Kalou MP David Kiaraho. They also want Uhuru to reward residents’ support by appointing an additional CS and PS from the region. The group said Kariuki has distinguished herself as a ‘hardworking Kenyan daughter’ during the short time she has served. “We are fronting her as Nyandarua’s first choice for a Cabinet post. We also want more,” Kimemia said during Jamhuri Day celebrations on Tuesday at Mirangine Primary School. He said Kariuki campaigned vigorously to see to it that Uhuru was reelected.
