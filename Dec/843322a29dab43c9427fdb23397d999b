Kisumu politicians yesterday skipped Jamhuri Day celebrations in the Jomo Kenyatta Sportsground. Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o, Senator Fred Outa, MP Fred Ouda and other county MPs were absent. The majority of county assembly members did not attend. This is the second time the politicians boycotted national holiday celebrations. In October, politicians and residents skipped the rally to mark Mashujaa Day in Nyakach constituency.  The event was poorly attended as only a fraction of the public were at the venue.  Those in attendance told the Star they were only around for the entertainment and would resume their business once the speeches started.  Resident Mary Akoth, who was watching from a distance, said people do not recognise President Uhuru Kenyatta’s leadership and are not interested in his speech. Immediately county commissioner Pauline Dola started reading the President’s speech, occupants began leaving.  The field was nearly empty, with less than 100 residents left. Only the invited guests stayed seated. Within the grounds, business went on as usual. Some youths were training in basketball and football on the pitch. Some fruit vendors around the field said Kisumu residents have lost hope in the government and anything it had to say.  “In previous years, we could sell our fruits and earn much because of the number of people attending the event, but compared to now, this is nothing,” Akoth said. Senior national government officials, led by county commissioner Dola, county police commander John Kamau, and other top security officers were present.
