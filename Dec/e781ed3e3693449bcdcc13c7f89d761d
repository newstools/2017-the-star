Internet TV service Showmax is now available to DStv Premium customers at no extra cost. However, the service will only be available for only a month, a move that is strategically laid out to offer extra entertainment as the festive season kicks off. The addition of this service seeks to provide an additional catalogue of popular series and movies available on demand with no ads to the premium customers. Through the partnership, fresh new shows from the United States will also be available in the DStv platform on a weekly basis. “Showmax will enable two concurrent streams on different devices, so parents can watch their shows on a laptop while the kids watch cartoons on their tablet. It will also give customers the option to download up to 25 TV shows and movies to their smartphone or tablet and keep them for up to 30 days using the Android or IOS apps,” Multichoice Kenya managing director Eric Odipo said Also, once you start watching a show or movie offline, you’ll have 48 hours to finish watching it, although data charges are billed in the customer’s account. Odipo hinted on their plan to invest in innovations in bid to provide great DStv content via the internet.
