Nyaribari Chache MP Richard Tongi on Wednesday defended his win in the August 8 poll following a petition challenging his election. He told the Kisii High court that he was validly elected saying the errors for which the case is grounded did not affect the outcome. The legislator fought claims that the IEBC subverted the will of Nyaribari people saying the commission followed election laws to the
latter. "I really want to appreciate the efforts by the commission in
conducting the elections despite errors which never affected the
outcome," he told the court presided over by Justice Anthony Ndung'u. Tong’i , during his testimony, said that the elections were tough because he was facing eight other contestants.  "I was validly elected even though the elections were tough. The exercise was conducted in a free and fair environment." Three petitioners Zaheer Jhanda (Wiper), Chris Bichage (ODM) and James Kenani (PDP) have filed separate petitions in challenging the MP's victory. When asked by Bichage’s  lawyer Philemon Ochwang'i whether he was contented with the 14, 140 votes he garnered, Tong’i said the margin of 3, 695 against the ODM candidate was an indication the people expressed their. On cross-examination by Jhanda’s lawyer Jennifer Mukobe, the legislator said his 149 agents relayed results from the polling stations to his secretariat adding that the same tallied with the votes IEBC used to declare him the winner.
