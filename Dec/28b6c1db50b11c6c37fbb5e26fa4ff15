A 35-year-old man was on Saturday night murdered by unidentified assailants in Bombay, Lamu. Jackson Wasi, who worked as a hotelier in Shella, was accosted and attacked by a panga-wielding gang at 10pm. He had just left his workplace and was heading to his Bombay home where he lived with his wife and five children. The attackers made away with his wallet and phone. He had deep panga cuts on his head, stomach and hands. A group of good Samaritans had rushed Wasi to the Lamu County Referral Hospital, but he was pronounced dead on arrival. “They hit him with blunt objects on the head and cut him with pangas on the head, stomach and hands. It was painful. It’s strange because he was a quiet person and had no issues with anyone. We hope the killers are brought to book,” friend John Mnyaka said. A group of nonlocals took to the streets to protest against the increased attacks against them. They marched to county commissioner Gilbert Kitiyo’s office and demanded to know why such attacks are rampant yet police patrols in volatile areas are said to be in high gear. “This isn’t the first time such an attack is happening or someone is dying.We are told not to worry because police patrol those areas yet we continue to die.What makes us angry is that only nonlocals are attacked and killed.We want to understand why. We must be assured of our security. It’s our right,” protester Ephantus Kirima said. Kitiyo said investigations are ongoing. He warned locals against carrying weapons.
