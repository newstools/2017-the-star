Nyando MP Jared Okello has reversed his statement saying he will not resign after consultations with NASA principals. Okello said on Thursday that he also had several meetings with residents, his relatives and colleagus. He announced that he and other MPs will collectively fight for Kenyans' rights in Parliament.  “I met the principals on December 21 when they expressed apprehension and advised that we collectively fight for the people," he told the media at his home. "They opine this will deter horrors from being visited upon innocent people in the opposing side." NASA principals are Raila Odinga (ODM), Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper), Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang'ula (Ford Kenya) and Musalia Mudavadi (Amani National Congress). The legislator noted Raila reaffirmed his commitment to taking oath of office and that he highlighted measures to be undertaken before the grand event. On December 18, Okello threatened to resign in two weeks in the event Raila was not sworn-in as president of the People's Republic of Kenya. He stunned mourners with the announcement in Nyakach, during the burial of veteran radio journalist Agao Patrobas. "I went to Parliament, not to sit on Opposition benches, but to support President Raila Odinga's policies as he discharges his mandate from State House. I had scanned the environment, followed the polls and was confident of a Raila win," he said. "I can't sit pretty in Parliament with people I know connived to snatch Raila's victory while he languishes in the cold."
