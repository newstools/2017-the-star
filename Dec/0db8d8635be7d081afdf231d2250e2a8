Residents of Diani-Mwakamba in Msambweni subcounty have protested against the plan to set up a marine reserve project at Kongo Beach. They yesterday said they would be unable to fish, which is their main source of income. Bongwe-Gombato MCA Hassan Mwasipho said locals would sink into poverty. “Most of the locals at Mwakamba village are beach operators and fishermen. If they start the project, where will my people get their daily bread?” he said. Mwasipho, who is also the chairman of the Kwale county Tourism Committee, said locals would be denied access to the beach if the project is implemented. “Give us an alternative and if we are satisfied, we will accept,” he said. Mwasipho said a meeting between him and locals did not bear fruit, adding they stuck to their decision not to support the project. KWS deputy senior warden Nathan Gatundu yesterday said locals have been misinformed by politicians. He said the area was gazetted as a reserve in 1995 and the service wants to safeguard it from illegal practices including sand harvesting.
