Former Citizen TV presenter Terryanne Chebet is reviewing 2017 as it comes to a close. This year has seen her lose her job, get baby number two, whom she named Talaa, and own a multimillion-shilling ride, a Range Rover Evoque. "2017 has truly been the year of YES! I started off stumbling, partly anxious, partly armed with courage knowing only too well that God cannot bring your way what you cannot conquer. I've grown immensely, in wisdom and in strength, I've lost but I have also won. I've lost friends but I've gained family. 2017 has been the year of learning, of immense blessings, of giving, and of loving. I thank God, and I thank you who encouraged me, prayed with and were patient with me, as I found my way in this new path in life. Asante. God bless. God wins." Â
