Married couples have been urged to use condoms because promiscuity and infidelity are a reality. This will steam the rising HIV infections and deaths. Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu on Saturday urged married couples who due to work circumstances only meet once in a while to be understanding and allow each other to keep condoms for use in “tempting situations”. She was speaking at Katulani trading centre during World Aids Day observations. The county marked the day 24 hours after the rest of the country. Ngilu urged residents to get HIV testing and counselling. She said her administration has provided adequate antiretrovirals and condoms. “I beg you to go for testing and get drugs. I do not want to hear of any more deaths from HIV-Aids because I have delivered drugs and a good number of doctors to all hospitals,” she said. Ngilu presented recently hired doctors.
