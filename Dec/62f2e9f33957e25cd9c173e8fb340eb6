Beneficiaries of the Kwale county bursary risk losing the scholarship fund if they score a D grade for two consecutive terms, MCAs have said.  Most beneficiaries of the bursary did not perform well in their end of year exams.  Speaking at Matuga Girls’ Secondary School on Thursday, the MCAs said they will direct the funds to other projects if they do not see value for investing in the education of the students. Mkongani MCA Ndoro Mweruphe told parents to ensure their children fully commit to their studies.  MCA Mishi Mayumbe said they were ready to cut off the bursary if the motion is tabled in the assembly.  “You are abusing a privilege given to you yet there are other students in other schools with better performances,” Mayumbe said.  Kasemeni MCA Antony Yama said that they will meet all parents to set new rules for the issuance of the bursary.
