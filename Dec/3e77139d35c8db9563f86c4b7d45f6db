Read: Judge to rule on Nyong'o case in January Kisumu High Court Judge David Majanja had earlier said the court will give a notice of judgment for the case before January 30. He stated that the court will rely on the submissions already laid before it to make its final determination of the case. Ranguma, the former governor, had filed a petition before the court challenging Nyong’o election victory. Several witnesses from both the petitioner’s, Governor Nyong’o’s and IEBC’s side testified in the case. Earlier last month, the court dismissed Ranguma’s application seeking an order for scrutiny and recount of votes. In his petition, Ranguma wants the court to overturn Nyong’o’s victory on grounds that the August elections for Kisumu governor seat were not conducted within the confines of the Constitution.  Ranguma told the court that the election was marred by massive malpractices and irregularities. He accused Nyong’o of conspiring with the electoral agency to rig him out in the polls. He claimed there was a myriad electoral malpractice during voting and transmission of the results. However, Governor Nyong’o through his lawyers James Orengo and Antony Oluoch, has maintained that the election that saw him win the seat was carried out in accordance with the constitution.
