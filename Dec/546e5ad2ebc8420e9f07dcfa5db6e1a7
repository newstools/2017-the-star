It is high time the National Police Service and the National Transport and Safety Authority reined in boda boda riders. They are fast becoming a law unto themselves and a danger to the rest of us. Yesterday angry boda boda riders set a bus with 20 passengers on fire in Homa Bay town for allegedly causing an accident in which a rider and his passenger fell from the motorbike (see P28). Upon setting eyes on the seriously injured rider and his passenger, boda boda operatives resolved to burn the bus and its passengers. This is outrageous. But this sort of thing can only be tackled with arrests, prosecutions and convictions followed by truly deterrent sentencing. Boda boda riders throughout Kenya have become lawless and murderously angry. Things are so bad that many drivers have resolved not to stop upon hitting or being hit by a motorcyclist. Boda bodas gather at the scene from all directions intent on harming anyone who has “hurt” one of their own. A spate of arrests, prosecutions and imprisonment involving boda bodas should happen without delay.
