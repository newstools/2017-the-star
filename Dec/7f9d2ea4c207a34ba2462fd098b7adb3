Nyeri politician Thuo Mathenge has urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to appoint a Cabinet Secretary from the county. “Such a CS will understand problems facing Nyeri people,” he said. Mathenge said the county deserves the post, since it has overwhelmingly supported the Jubilee government for many years. He spoke on Saturday during the first graduation of Brade Gate International College at YMCA Hall, Nyeri town, where he is the chairman. Earlier, Nyeri Senator Ephraim Maina had also said a CS should be appointed from the county. Mathenge at the same time urged residents to join hands and pray for the county after the death of an MCA and the governor in one month. Ruguru MCA Peter Weru collapsed and died on Jamhuri Day. Weru said he felt dizzy as he was addressing a gathering at Nduduini Primary School in Mathira constituency and was rushed to hospital, but he died. Early last month, Governor Wahome Gakuru died in a tragic road accident. Early this year, first Nyeri Governor Nderitu Gachagua died while undergoing treatment in London. He died from pancreatic cancer.
