A group of people living with disability held demonstrations in Ol Kalou town on Wednesday after the Nyandarua county government sidelined them in jobs. They accused area leaders of neglecting them "despite being ferried on motorbikes and all manner of vehicles to go and vote on August 8".  The group, which assembled at Nyandarua Senator Githiomi Mwangi's office before marching on the streets, said they missed out on nomination slots at the county assembly. Peter Mbogo, the Ol Kalou disabled people organization chairman, said they will not associate with the county assembly until they get a representation. "Of the 39 MCAs in Nyandarua, 25 are elected and 14 nominated. There is not a single person who represents people living with disability," he said. They asked Nyandarua speaker Wahome Ndegwa not to abdicate his role by ignoring the rights of the disabled. "All elected leaders have ignored us," the group said on Wednesday. Speaker Wahome Ndegwa said Article 90 the Constitution does not make it mandatory for people living with disability to be represented in county assembly. Click here for latest political news Â
