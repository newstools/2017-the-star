Politicians in Kuria region have been accused of refusing to help security agents end the high levels of insecurity and cattle rustling in the region. On Saturday night, cattle rustlers armed with AK-47 rifles attacked homes in Marindi, Suna West subcounty, bordering Kuria West subcounty. The rustlers engaged residents in running battles as they tried to steal cattle in homesteads before making away with five from Hillary Otieno’s homestead. They fled towards Kuria area. Resident Jack Otieno told the Star three days ago the same rustlers stole eight cattle from another homestead. “They shot in the air to scare us off as we trailed them from 2am,” Otieno said. He said two weeks ago, resident Owaga Mang’ana’s son was attacked by rustlers. “We have tried severally to end the stand off, but we are sure politicians in the region are behind the high cases of insecurity as they have refused to broker peace between the Luo and Kuria communities,” Otieno said. During Jamuhuri Day celebrations, Kegonga assistant commissioner Wesley Koech said local leaders have failed to work with the police to end the problem.
