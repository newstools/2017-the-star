 President Uhuru Kenyatta and opposition leader Raila Odinga have been urged to dialogue and unite Kenya. A group of women in Nyamira county yesterday said dialogue will end divisions. Le by Borabu Women’s Joint Food Processing Group chairperson Margaret Ombuna, the women said they do not want to relive the 2007-08 post-election violence. ‘‘We lost lives and shed blood,’’ she said. Ombuna said the state of the economy deteriorated during the election period, adding the two leaders have the power to heal the country. The women said it is not right for youths to have been killed during demonstrations. ‘‘Let the leaders be an example to us so that our country can have direction,’’ Ombuna said. They also urged Raila not to set a new date for his swearing-in.
