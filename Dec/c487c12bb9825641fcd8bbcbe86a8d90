The petitioner challenging the election of Laikipia Governor Ndiritu Muriithi yesterday was dealt another blow after the court barred him from introducing a report on sealing of ballot boxes.  Seating at the High Court in Nanyuki Justice Mary Kasango said Sammy Ndung’u had not obtained a leave of court to present a report on his observations, while putting additional seals on 531 ballot boxes. The judge concurred with the governor, who had argued that the petitioner had not informed the court on time about his intentions to introduce the report.  “The petitioner failed to obtain a leave of court and to allow its inclusion at this juncture would be prejudicial to the respondents. The court orders the report on sealing of ballot boxes be expunged from the court records and be returned to the petitioner,” Kasango said.
