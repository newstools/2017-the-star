A mother who set her 17-year-old daughter on fire as punishment for going home late has been remanded to Langata Women's Prison. The woman was arraigned at a Kibera court on Wednesday but she did not plead to the charge of cruelty to a child. The court ordered her to undergo psychiatric evaluation before she takes plea. Police alleged that on December 3 in Kawangware 46, Nairobi, the suspect willfully poured kerosene on the minor's skirt and then struck the match. They said the mother locked her child in the house for more than a week, and applied toothpaste on her wounds, instead of taking her to hospital. She allegedly took the girl to a friend's house to prevent suspicion by neighbours but her condition worsened, forcing a trip to the hospital. The case will be mentioned on January 24.
