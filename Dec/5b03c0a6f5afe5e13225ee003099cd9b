A court in Embu was yesterday stunned after a 40-year-old woman was charged with assaulting and injuring her mother, with the help of her 14- year-old daughter.  Julia Mukami and her daughter appeared
before magistrate Vincent Nyakundi, and charged with
assaulting her 70-year-old mother, Cecilia Ciokinyua, on December 17 in
Itabua sublocation. The two were accused of unlawfully kicking
and slapping the old woman following a quarrel and causing her
actual bodily harm. They denied the offense and were released on Sh10,
000 personal bond each. Mukami told the court that her mother kicked her little children out of the house that night after a misunderstanding, and refused to open for them, hence, they forcibly opened the door. She said her mother reported to Itabua police station of having been
assaulted and injured. Nyakundi directed that the two be supplied with copies of documents intended to be used in the case, including the charge sheet and prosecution witness’s statements. Hearing of their case has been fixed for January 16 next year.
