The Makueni police officer who killed his boss on Wednesday night and fled has been arrested. The victim has been identified as Deputy OSC Dennis Wanjala. Makueni police commander Joseph Nameiyan said the officer was arrested on Thursday at Kwakathinzi area in Nzaui sub-county. Nameiyan said police trailed the man to the location and found him at about 11am.  "We have arrested him ... he was not armed ... we have him," he said, adding they were alerted by boda boda operators and that the officer was taken to Makueni police station. Area police boss Bosita Omukolongolo had said the shooter fled with his gun but Nameiyan said he hid it at the station after the incident. The weapon was recovered. The suspect is said to have boarded a Makindu-bound matatu with the intention of alighting along Nairobi-Mombasa highway for an easy escape. He alighted before a police road block and took a different route to the highway but was eventually arrested. "We informed the public through local vernacular radios stations which reported that the officer had been spotted." The officer injured two other people in the incident - they were taken to Makueni Level Four Hospital and Armed Forces Memorial Hospital along Mbgathi Road in Nairobi.
