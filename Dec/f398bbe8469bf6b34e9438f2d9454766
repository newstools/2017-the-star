Security officers working in Baringo county will not go for Christmas until they recover the livestock stolen by armed bandits this month, Deputy President William Ruto said yesterday. He directed Rift Valley regional coordinator Wanyama Musiambo and Baringo county commissioner Peter Okwanyo to lead the county security team in the recovery operation.

You should start pitching your tents in those volatile areas,” Ruto said. His statement comes a day after 20 suspected armed Pokot bandits raided Kagir village in Baringo North subcounty and stole 77 cattle belonging to 12 Tugen families. On Monday last week, about 40 suspected armed bandits attacked Chemoe, surrounded the Anti-Stock Theft Unit camp and made away with 38 cattle belonging to three families. Ruto said Baringo’s volatile areas have about 500 police and National Police Reservists, but “it’s so sad and shameful that armed bandits are left to enjoy a field day killing people and stealing.” Click here for the latest political news
