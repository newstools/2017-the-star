Police killed an armed robber during a break-in at a senior security official's home on Friday night. He was among a group of armed robbers attempting to steam from the house of Robinson Ndiema within the AP camp in Kapenguria, West Pokot. He died during a two-hour gun exchange with police officers. Area AP commander Benson Maina said five robbers broke Ndeima's home at 9pm. "They took advantage of the [fact that the] commissioner was not around to break in and steal," he added. He said four suspects escaped but they did not manage to steal any items. Maina said the body of the suspect was taken to Kapenguria County Hospital mortuary. He said they are pursuing the accomplices as they continue to investigate the incident.  The commander also said no weapons were recovered at the scene.
