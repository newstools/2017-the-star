Othaya level IV hospital will be opened in February next year. Area MP Gichuki Mugambi said the Sh1 billion facility will officially be opened by President Uhuru Kenyatta. The facility, which has taken over seven years to be completed, will serve neighbouring counties including Laikipia, Murang'a and Kirinyaga. It has a capacity of 350 beds. After the handing over ceremony, the Health ministry will start now installing machines before staff are hired. After opening, the facility will start phase II of construction, which includes building of the mortuary, administration block, laundry and kitchen units. Mugambi said the morgue should be given priority as the nearby facilities, namely Mukurwe-ini Hospital or Nyeri Referral Hospital, are currently overwhelmed.
