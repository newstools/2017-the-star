Kenya have moved up five places to 106 in the final Fifa rankings of the year. Stars are ranked 26th on the continent. The slight improvement comes at the back of clinching the Cecafa Senior Challenge Cup although the regional tournament is not sanctioned by the world governing body. Uganda are the highest ranked team in the region despite dropping one place to position 75. Burundi are down four places to 142 while Ethiopia (up two places to 143), Tanzania (down five places to 147) while South Sudan (down one place to 153) complete the Cecafa region placings. Senegal is the highest ranked African side at position 23 followed by Tunisia (27) with World Cup-bound Egypt (31) and third on the continent followed by Congo DR and Morocco. Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Ghana and Nigeria complete the top 10 best African sides. The top five worldwide hasn’t changed as Germany, Brazil, Portugal, Argentina and Belgium retained their slots. Spain, Poland, Switzerland, France and Chile complete the top 10 sides. Elsewhere, Mathare United have signed Posta Ranger defender Gilbert Osonga on a four-year deal. The young defender, who saw less game time under the stewardship of Sammy Omollo at Rangers, becomes United’s third signing in the off-season transfer window after goalkeeper Job Ochieng from Kakamega High School and Francis Omondi from National Super League (NSL) side Modern Coast Rangers. Osonga has previously featured for Zetech University and Young Rovers. At Rovers, he played alongside Lennox Ogutu who joined Mathare United earlier this year. Omondi signed a three-year deal while Ochieng was handed a four-year contract.
