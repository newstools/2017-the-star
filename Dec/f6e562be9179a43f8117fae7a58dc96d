The High Court in Murang’a has suspended water boards in the county until a case filed by water companies is heard and determined.  The firms filed the case on October 27 seeking nullification of a gazette notice published by the county government.  The notice suspended all water boards and appointed a 13-member caretaker committee to manage the water sector.  Justice Hatari Waweru on Friday, however, ruled that the committee should carry out its mandate pending determination of the case.  He said water companies should continue to provide water services without feeling threatened by the notice published on October 9.  “I will, therefore, stay, pending disposal of the substantive motion,” Hatari said.  The water companies, through their lawyer Charles Agwara, said the caretaker committee appointed by the county government is interfering with their operations.  They said the county government has no legal authority to suspend water boards as the companies are corporate entities that are not owned by the county government.  The companies also rejected the inclusion of the committee in their boards, saying two members represent the county government.  The county said provision of water services is a devolved function.
