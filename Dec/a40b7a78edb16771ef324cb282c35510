Somali security forces
arrested a former minister and presidential candidate in an
overnight raid on his home in which they killed five of his
bodyguards, police and lawmakers said on Monday. A spokesman for the Internal Security Ministry said
Abdirahman Abdishakur was accused of treason.  Abdishakur, who
stood in the February presidential election, is an opposition
politician and an outspoken critic of the weak, United
Nations-backed government led by President Mohamed Abdullahi
Mohamed. "The former minister was legally arrested by decree from the
attorney general and internal security minister. He was accused
of treason. His guards fought the security forces," spokesman
Abdiasis Ali told reporters on Monday. A policeman confirmed five bodyguards were killed in the
raid, while a local elder Abdullahi Ali told Reuters Abdishakur
had been injured on the arm by a stray bullet. The raid drew angry responses from lawmakers and protesters.
Hundreds of people marched in Mogadishu on Monday as government
forces deployed to block main roads. "What the government is doing is against Islam and healthy
politics," lawmaker Mahad Salad told Reuters. "We condemn the
government's immoral act. We also order for the release of the
ex-minister." The presidential election in February was praised by Western
donors as a modest step forward from the previous election and
it raised hopes that the country might be able to more
effectively combat Islamist insurgents. But the insurgency is striking with ever larger and more
deadly attacks in the capital and major towns. Reuters reported last week that the United States is
suspending food and fuel aid for most of Somalia's armed forces
over corruption concerns, a blow to the military as African
peacekeepers start to withdraw this month.
