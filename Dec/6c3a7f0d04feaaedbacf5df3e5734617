Uasin Gishu county has suspended 42 revenue officers over the theft of Sh4 million during the election period. Finance chief officer Peter Chesos said the officers, most from the parking department, have been sent home to facilitate investigations. "We have given them letters to show cause on why they should not be disciplined over the financial malpractices," he said on Friday. He said the officers are suspected to have given fake banking slips indicating they had deposited money collected. The theft is said to have taken place between July and October. "We suspect they took advantage of the election period to engage in diversion of revenue," Chesos said. The suspension comes shortly after Governor Jackson Mandago warned about being tough on graft.
