Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati has assured staff hired during Kenneth Lusaka's tenure that his administration will not sack them. He told the team to relax and concentrate on their jobs of developing the county for the betterment of the lives of the residents. The county offices has been tense as employees grappled with the thought that the new administration will show them the door. "I understand the anxiety that comes with transition. This happens everywhere across the globe. But I want to assure you that there is no need to worry." "I want you to relax and serve wananchi," the governor told county officials during the lighting of the Christmas tree at Mabanga Farmers Training Centre in Kabuchai.  The governor said he is among the top five county bosses who did not sack staff after taking over from their predecessors. A number of counties have made changes, especially on the committee executive members, chief officers, and directors in charge of various departments. "I want to assure you that I did not come here to sack anyone. I say that because you have been doing a good work. Go on with the good team work," Wangamati added. "If you leave, you will have sacked yourself.  Even the first lady has been working with the staff who worked with Mrs Lusaka." Speaking separately at Wekheleka village in Sirisia, Lusaka - now Senate speaker, said he will support Wangamati to foster and attain development in the county.
