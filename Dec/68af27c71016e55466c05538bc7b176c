Uasin Gishu Senator Prof Margaret Kamar says she will not antagonise Governor Jackson Mandago. Kamar said she would work with him to ensure prudent use of resources. She spoke during an interview with the Star in Eldoret yesterday. “In the past we saw governors facing problems with senators. They engaged in frequent quarrels. I believe we can achieve more when we work in harmony rather than engage in political fights,” Kamar said. She said Uasin Gishu had good development in the last five years. Kamar said she would work with other leaders to achieve more. The senator urged the governor and the county assembly to find ways of cutting the wage bill and freeing resources for development. ”We should be using more than 70 per cent of the budget on projects,” Kamar said. The senator urged the county government to increase revenue collection and cut down on unnecessary expenditures. “We need to transform people’s lives in five years8,” Kamar said.
