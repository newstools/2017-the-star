Dela Maranga creates an intoxicatingly intimate impression, making you feel as if she's divulging her most treasured personal experiences to you. There's a self-possessed allure that is extremely appealing, cleansing and nurturing to listen to. Though she takes influences from various genres, she evokes a smooth R&B vibe that seemingly captures her melodic assertions. Her music stays true to the times and overflows with familiar sensations to an extent that it offers soothing sensuality. She puts her own spin into every issue she tackles, leaving her fans invigorated. We almost certainly became aware of the soulful songstress about a decade ago, when she delivered her pleasant-sounding vocals on Sauti Sol's "Mama". Then, probably, we started paying attention to her four years ago, when she started releasing solo projects such as "Weche Tek".  She now sounds like an experienced artist, who has found comfort in her sound and her catalogue is much broader, full of praiseworthy tunes. Whether she releases a solo or collaborative effort, her contribution to each and every tune is measurable. Her version of Adele's hit song "Hello" was indisputably one of the biggest covers in the world. To some extent, it confirmed her originality and brilliance as a singer. Dela's musicality is impeccable and diverse. She explores love and relationships and does it in a way that she details both the pleasant and nasty aspects involved. And when she decides to venture into other topics, she somehow still manages to stick out.  At 28, she has placed herself as a significant figure in the local music scene. She is a force to reckon with. Her music is uniquely her own - showcasing her in her womanly glory - spelling out to her fans that it is okay to feel yourself.
