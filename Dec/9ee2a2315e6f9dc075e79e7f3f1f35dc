Thika Queens lost 1-2 to surrender the title to Vihiga Queens as the 2017 Kenya women’s Premier League play-offs matches came to an end at the Camp Toyoyo grounds yesterday It was sweet revenge for the Kakamega County outfit after Thika won 2-0 against them last season.  Terry Engesha scored a brace in the 14 and 32 minutes for the winners while Wincate Kaari pulled one back for losers in 28th minute.  Vihiga Queens were a better side in the first 10 minutes of play with national team player Corazon Aquino, Cynthia Shilwatso and Engesha combining well up-front but were wasteful.  Thika rarely threatened and opted to counter on many occasions . They were, however, punished in the 14th minute when new singing Engesha from Vihiga Leeds scored to put the Western-based outfit in the lead 1-0. Thika begun to grow in game with hits and misses here and there before the national Under-20 women’s team captain Wincate Kaari equalised in the 28th minute to restore parity. From there, it was give and take from both sides but it was Vihiga who showed vigour and urge to score and it didn’t come as a surprise when individual efforts from Engesha saw her complete a brace in the 32nd minute as Vihiga enjoyed a 2-1 lead with 13 minutes to the end of the first half. After the breather, both sides made changes with Thika coach Benta Achieng introducing Juliet Ouma for Nelly Sawe and Vihiga coach Alex Alumira resting Aquino for Myline Awour. Onces again Vihiga dominated the early proceeding but were poor on delivery. Shilwatso should have scored for Vihiga in the 67th minute but her shot went wide. Thika were in hunt for an equaliser but Vihiga goalkeeper Lilian Awour was on the alert, staging good saves. Hits and misses was the order of the day for both teams in the remaing minutes of play as the second half ended goal-less.
