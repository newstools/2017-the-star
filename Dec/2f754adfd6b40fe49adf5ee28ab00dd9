Vihiga county commissioner Alex ole Ngoyo has warned chiefs and their assistants against settling incest cases out of court. “During Christmas seasons, sex-related cases increase and chiefs should be on the alert,” he said. Ngoyo also urged the police to be vigilant and ensure no molestations take place. “I know there are many cases of sexual molesting, especially among members of the same family, but they are solved secretly and some involve chiefs who allow a cow to be slaughtered in the name of cleansing,” he said. “If you're found presiding over such cases, you will go home on that very day.” Police will follow up such cases and gather evidence for prosecution so no culprit goes scot-free, Ngoyo said. He said incest is a “terrible offence” forbidden in the Bible. Ngoyo cautioned parents and guardians against sending their children to trading centres late in the evening. Criminals take advantage of such situations, he said.
