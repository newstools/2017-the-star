Exhaust fumes from vehicles remains the biggest pollutant in the country, a UN Environment Assembly was told on Saturday. Environment Secretary Alice Kaudia said the government will tighten its grip on implementation of laws governing importation of vehicles so as to cut carbon emissions from exhaust fumes. She said the government will ensure strict adherence to the requirements that only vehicles that have not been used for over eight years are allowed into the country. "We are also strengthening the testing of vehicles to curb emissions. This will reduce the pollution and improve the quality of air that we breath," she said. Kaudia spoke at the third session of the United Nations Environment Assembly in Nairobi. She said the government is working closely with strategic partners, such as the 119-member climate and clean air coalition, with a specific focus on reducing pollution from vehicles. The Environment Secretary said the 47 county governments have a role to play in ensuring the air people breathe is of good quality.

She said counties will be supported by state department of environment to work with various strategic partners in the management of solid waste. Kaudia said e-waste regulations and management guidelines are already in place. "We are also working on a Waste Management Bill which is already before Parliament. We are also consulting Kenyans for their feedback on the proposed law." "A huge section of the bill will be on e-waste management," the state official said.
