Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho has denied claims that Hezron Awiti’s running mate Hassan Mwamtoa was his spy. Awiti ran against Joho for the governor’s seat in August. Joho has since appointed Mwamtoa to his cabinet.  Following Mwamtoa’s appointment, claims have have been made that he was being used by the governor to spy on his opponent. “Some of us do things differently. Just because he ran with my opponent does not mean we cannot work together,” Joho said. “We beat Awiti but some of the people who worked with him had good ideas. That’s why we have given them the opportunity to serve,” Joho said. Mwamtoa was among four executives who were sworn in on Tuesday. The other six had taken the oath of office in November.
