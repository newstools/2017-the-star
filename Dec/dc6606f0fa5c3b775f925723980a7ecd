A suicide bomber in police
uniform blew himself up inside a police training camp in
Somalia's capital Mogadishu on Thursday, killing at least 13
police officers, officials said. Police spokesman Major Mohamed Hussein said the attacker,
with explosives strapped to his body, infiltrated the General
Kahiye Police Training Academy and struck during a police
parade. Abdikadir Abdirahman, the director of Amin Ambulances, told
Reuters: "We have carried 13 dead people and fifteen others who
were injured from the police academy." The militant Islamist group al Shabaab claimed
responsibility for the attack. "We will give details of casualties later," said Abdiasis
Abu Musab, the group's military operations spokesman. Al Shabaab carries out frequent bombings in Mogadishu and
other towns. It is waging an insurgency against the UN-backed
government and its African Union allies in a bid to topple the
weak administration and impose its own strict interpretation of
Islam. The militants were driven out of Mogadishu in 2011 and have
since been steadily losing territory to the combined forces of
African Union peacekeepers and Somali security forces.
