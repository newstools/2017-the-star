The government will next year develop a database to help identify fake and genuine academics papers. The database will be used by those seeking reference of certified academic papers from public and private institutions of higher learning. Speaking in Nairobi yesterday, Education CS Fred Matiang'i said the move aims to ensure there is order, coordination and proper management of education. "The ministry has been experiencing a difficult time in dealing with fraudulent academic papers, including during the election period in verifying those vying for various posts. The database is the surest way to ensure we have proper records," he said. However, the database will not cover those who acquired there academic papers outside the country. The database will rely on a raft of reforms under a National Qualification Framework developed to guide the institutions of higher learning. Â
