Mombasa Deputy Governor William Kingi and county commissioner Evans Achoki have traded barbs over who is responsible for the poor state of garbage collection. Yesterday, Kingi claimed police last week stormed Kibarani dumpsite and impounded garbage trucks. He said police claimed an unidentified ‘private entity’ made a report that triggered their move. Kingi alleged Achoki was issuing instructions to the police.  “The police and businessmen are interfering with our work to clean the town. We were informed the instructions were from Achoki. We are seeing the hand of the government and we will not sit back and watch this happen.” But Achoki told Kingi to ‘deal with your own filth’. He said his name should not be dragged into the county’s mess. “If I gave any order for the impounding of county vehicles, they should be in police stations right now. Are there any county vehicles in any police station?” Achoki said. He spoke after delivering President Uhuru Kenyatta’s Madaraka Day speech at Tononoka grounds in Mombasa. Achoki said Kingi should get his facts right before speaking. “I respect the county government,” Achoki said.
