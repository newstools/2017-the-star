Workers of the Murang’a Water and Sanitation Company on Wednesday were locked out by county security officers. Tension started on Tuesday after Water executive Paul Macharia relocated from the county headquarters offices to the company’s offices. He took over offices that previously belonged to managing director Daniel Ng’ang’a. The executive toured all offices and served Ng’ang’a with a letter, sending him on a compulsory leave. Workers expressed fears of intimidation and unfair sacking by the county government and asked why the MD’s office had been taken over.  Macharia said no one would be sacked and said the county is restructing the water sector. The gates were reopened.  Residents have complained about high water fees and lack of supply.  The company refused to reduce fees, as the county requested.
