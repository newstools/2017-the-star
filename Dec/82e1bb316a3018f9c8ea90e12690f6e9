Makueni Senator Mutula Kilonzo Jr has tabled a Bill which proposes to amend the National Flag, Emblems and Names Act. In a gazette notice on October 17, Kalonzo says amending the Act will allow members of the public to fly the flag at their homes, work and business. "Patriotism is a national value. The Bill seeks to allow members of the public express their patriotism by flying the flag in their private residences," he said. He argued that promotion of patriotism has a positive effect on governance at the county level and promoted national cohesion.
