Gambling dens are destroying marriages in Thika town, boda boda operators complained yesterday. They have urged the area administration to crack down on them. The operators said their spouses gamble away the money the husbands leave in the house for food. Some said gambling has led to frequent fights, which in the long run cause breakups. “We are tired of these gaming machines. They have drained our savings and created animosity between couples,” Peter Muiruri said.   “Don’t be surprised when you leave your wife money for food and she ends up losing it to the gambling machines. The result will be a fight when you get back home from work and find no food.”  The operators spoke on Kiganjo Estate, when officers from Makongeni police station raided two betting joints and arrested eight gamblers. The officers also confiscated six betting machines. Muiruri said in most betting joints, women are “shamelessly queuing to gamble, and that the habit has attracted even our children”. “Mostly during the day and in the evening, you’ll find women flocking the gambling joints and this has been extended to young schoolgoing children, who are even stealing coins from their parents to gamble,” he said.  Some of the women who spoke during the raid said they gamble to make an extra coin. They, however, said they lose most of the times. Resident Hillary Njoroge urged area MP Patrick Wainaina, who had accompanied the officers during the raid, to ensure the illegal betting joints are closed and banned. “This craze is adversely affecting our families and, if not controlled in a few months, there will be family squabbles all over,” Njoroge said.  The MP urged the state to control betting.
