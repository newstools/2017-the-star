Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago has asked NASA to
accept dialogue with Uhuru Kenyatta following the President's inauguration on Tuesday. The county boss said the Opposition has no option but to recognise Uhuru as head of state because the latter is in power constitutionally. "Those who wanted dialogue like NASA
can now come for it instead of resisting because we now have President
Kenyatta in power," Mandago said on Friday. However, Opposition leader Raila Odinga has maintained that he doesn't recognise Uhuru's win adding that he will be inaugurated as president on December 12. On this regard, the party dispatched invitations to its supporters to attend the event whose venue is yet to be disclosed.

the opposition should engage in talks over whatever grievances they have
on national issues. He said Uhuru is now the country's leader and should be recognised as such by all, including the opposition. Mandago says Opposition leaders should focus on helping to unite Kenyans instead of pushing for political instability in the country. "There was no way everyone was going to win elections and those who lost must accept and move on. NASA has tried all ways which have not worked. Let them back Uhuru." The governor said Kenyans should now forget politics and concentrate on development activities to recover the time lost in the last one year. He regretted that "too much
politics"  delayed county operations but all programmes would run
smoothly starting next January. "We must now move forward as a county and avoid waste of time on political gossip," Mandago said. Related: US congratulates Uhuru, hails Kenya for ending election process Click here for the latest political news
