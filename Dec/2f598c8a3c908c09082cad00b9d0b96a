The government has banned smoking of shisha. Health CS Cleopa Mailu, in a gazette notice yesterday, said they had banned the importation, manufacture, advertising and sale of shisha in this country. Anyone found contravening the new rules will be liable to a fine not exceeding Sh50,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or both. If the offence is of a continuing nature, a further fine not exceeding Sh1,000 per day will be imposed, the legal notice dated December 28 says. “No person shall import, manufacture, sell, offer for sale, use, advertise, promote, facilitate or encourage shisha smoking in Kenya,” the notice reads.

It is popular among young people. However, most smokers are unaware of the danger it poses. Kenya’s ban comes days after Rwanda became the second country in Africa to ban shisha smoking. Tanzanian President John Magufuli imposed the ban in July.

This is unlike shisha-smoking sessions, which typically last 20 to 80 minutes, during which the smoker may take 50 to 200 puffs which range from about 0.15 to 1 litre each.” Shisha also causes problems during pregnancy, WHO said.  A study by the University of Nairobi found that shisha had traces of opiates. The report says pipe-sharing could lead to the spread of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and hepatitis.
