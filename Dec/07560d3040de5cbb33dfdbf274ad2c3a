The Sh202 million modern Karatina market, Nyeri county, will be completed by the end of April next year. An official from the department of Housing and Development Lawrence Mwangi said once the contractor finishes the market he will hand it over to the county government. Speaking when he led a delegation to the site Monday, Mwangi ,who was accompanied by Mathira MP Rigathi Gachagua, said the market has taken over seven years to be complete due to inadequate funding and changing contractors. He said more than 90 per cent of the project has been done and the contractor has promised to complete it by April 30. Rigathi said the market has a capacity of 2,500 traders and priority will be given to the 2,100 original traders who have been operating at a makeshift market.  “A committee, which includes members of the market, MCA’s, MP’s office and from the county and national government has been formed to ensure the original traders are accommodated first,” he said. He urged local traders to give the contractor time to finish the work.
