Political analyst Mutahi Ngunyi has hit at Opposition leader Raila Odinga saying he should be allowed to die. He was reacting to Raila's remarks that he is ready to die if that would "guarantee Kenyans electoral justice and an end to electoral fraud." Raila laughed off assertions by AG Githu Muigai that he would be charged with treason, whose penalty is death, should he be sworn in as President. For the third time now, Raila has promised he would be sworn in as the People’s President.
