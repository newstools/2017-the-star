A petition has been filed before the Judicial Service Commission seeking the removal of High Court judge John Mativo over claims of breach of oath of office, gross misconduct and misbehaviour. Adrian Njenga , a lawyer, wants justice Mativo removed from the Judiciary, claiming he has manifested inability to perform his duties. “At an unknown place and time, the judge altered a ruling delivered in an open court and inserted or caused to be inserted into the court file an altered copy of the ruling different from what he delivered, signed and handed to parties,” Njenga states in the petitioner filed on Tuesday. The claims against the judge arise from a petition filed at the Constitutional and Human Rights division of the High Court at Nairobi challenging the appointment of the Communications Authority of Kenya board. The judgement was issued on February 24. Being dissatisfied with the verdict on account of material omissions on the part of the court, Njenga sought a review of the decision on May 15. The application was heard by Mativo on September 25 and the ruling earmarked for delivery on October 18. “Astonishingly, I was called a day later by a court assistant who informed me to go back the following day to pick the ruling.” He said no explanation was tendered to shed light as to how the ruling was finalised in less than a day. During the hearing, Njenga complained the judge “inescapably exhibited undue hostility” towards him and further alleges he deliberately refused to record his submissions. He also claimed the decision issued to him is an outright piracy and copy-paste of a previous decision. According to him, the judge has failed to promote fairness.
