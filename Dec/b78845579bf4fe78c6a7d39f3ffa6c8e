Despite the gains recorded after the rollout of an oral daily drug to prevent HIV infection, health experts have noted key misconceptions.

The pre-exposure prophylaxis drug is blue. Those who do not know what it is believe the drug is a mental health drug or viagra.  “This is what we have heard from our clients. People mistake those on prep to be suffering from schizophrenia because the colour of these drugs is also blue,” Ogolla said. She attended a science cafe organised by the Media for Environment Science, Health, Agriculture and Technology.
