Christmas weekend will be cool and dry across the country, the weatherman says. This means travelling conditions will be good, as no region will have heavy rains. Head of meteorological services Peter Ambenje said Christmas Day will be dry. The only rains expected this week will be light showers scattered over Western Kenya, Ukambani and the Coast. “Dry conditions are expected in most parts of the country for much of the forecast period. The Coast as well as regions within Eastern parts of the country are, however, likely to receive some rainfall,” Ambenje said in a seven-day forecast ending Monday next week. He said people travelling to Western Kenya will enjoy sunny intervals every morning. However, scattered afternoon showers and thunderstorms are expected on Sunday in South Rift, especially in Kajiado. Those travelling around Nairobi, Central Kenya, Embu, Nyeri and Meru counties will enjoy sunny intervals daily until Christmas Day. However, on Saturday morning, they should expect heavier clouds and light rainfall in a few places. “Afternoon showers may be experienced in a few places on Sunday,” he said. At the Coast, light morning showers and sunny afternoons are expected in several places until Sunday, but Christmas Day will be dry. Southeastern counties of Kitui, Makueni, Machakos and Taita Taveta will have heavier clouds on Sunday morning with rains falling in few places. Christmas Day will be dry, Amenje said. The weatherman said January weather will be hot and harsh, leading to poor crop performance this season. “The January-February 2018 period is expected to be sunny and dry, with very high daytime temperatures,” Ambenje said.
