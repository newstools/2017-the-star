set aside Sh50 million to finance the first ever census on street children countrywide. Street Families Rehabilitation Trust Fund director Robert Njogu said the census will be conducted in January by the department of special programmes in collaboration with UNICEF. Njogu made the revelation during a workshop at the Fish Eagle Hotel in Naivasha yesterday. He said lack of data on street families had affected plans to assist them.
