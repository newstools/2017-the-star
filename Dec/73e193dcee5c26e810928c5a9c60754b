Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has defended his working relationship with Deputy Governor Polycarp Igathe. He dismissed reports that they are at loggerheads over the running of city affairs leading to intervention from the President's Office. “I'm in very good books with my deputy Polycarp Igathe. The National government owes us over Sh 80,000,000,000(80b) and already they've started releasing this money to us in bits,” Sonko posted on his Facebook page on Thursday. Earlier, reports indicated that an intergovernmental committee at Harambee House is virtually running the show at City Hall and also making decisions on major projects, awarding contracts and filling influential posts. More on this: Sonko and Igathe fall out as State House takes charge of City Hall A source said the intervention by Harambee House was part of a ploy by the executive to politically position itself through the capture and control of county resources. Nairobi county contributes 60 per cent to Kenya’s GDP. Igathe, the former Vivo Energy MD, is believed to be highly favoured by the executive to run the show at City Hall, a move said to have angered his boss. But Sonko dismissed the reports saying his government is working in collaboration with the national government for the well being of Nairobi county. “We shall continue to partner with them for better transformation and well being of Nairobians in terms of service delivery,” Sonko said. He attached screenshots of alleged Whatsapp and text conversation with Igathe as proof of their good working relations. “Looking at the attached TEXTS and WHATSAAP conversations does it look like we are falling apart?” Sonko said. During campaigns for the August 8 polls, Sonko had said Igathe were the talk of town after a video of their fun-filled photoshoot was shared on social media. Deputy President William Ruto endorsed the two saying "they are a dynamic duo who will win the Nairobi seat by a landslide". Click here for the latest political news
