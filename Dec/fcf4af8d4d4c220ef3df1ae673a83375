Thika United confront Ushuru FC today at Thika Sub County Stadium in the first leg of the playoff lined up to determine who will make the cut for the SportPesa Premier League. The playoff, which pits the 16th finisher of the top flight and the third-placed finisher of the National Super League will see the winner of the two-legged clash win the remaining spot in the country’s elite football league. Thika United head coach Nicholas Muyoti yesterday exuded confidence that they will prevaqil and commendedc his charges for job well done inn the Premiership, which saw them survive the chop. Thika finished 16th with 38 points same as Western Stima who were axed to the Nationwide League due to goal difference. Muyoti said they hope to replicate the tempo exhibited in the last five rounds of matches in today’s duel.  “We are ready and this match means a lot for us as a club. We finished the league on a high note and I believe the tempo we had shall be replicated in today’s game. I have full confidence in my squad though we shall miss Said Tsuma, who is engaged with the national team assignment in the ongoing Cecafa Senior Challenge Cup. Michael Mutinda or Saad Musa will stand in for Tsuma. In our last league match against Bandari, we missed Tsuma and we won so his absence may not be felt much. We hope to score as many goals as a way of evading pressure in the second leg.” For Ushuru, the pain of missing out in the promotion mix in the final day will inspire them more to fight for what is theirs till the final match day. Ushuru were leading the National Super League charts in the final match day but the disappointing 1-0 loss to Vihuiga United saw them drop third hence today’s playoff to determine their fate.They host the second leg duel on December 10 at Narok County Stadium. On the occasion of draws in both legs, the winner shall be decided on penalties.
