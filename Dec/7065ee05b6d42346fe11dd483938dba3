Mwingi deputy county commissioner David Rotich has warned chiefs against setting up Kangaroo courts to arbitrate rape cases.Rotich spoke at Kavuvwani in Mwingi Central subcounty on Tuesday. He said the law on defilement is clear and suspects should not be allowed to walk free. “What is the work of the police? Chiefs have to report, and the police will handle the suspect,” Rotich said. The deputy county commissioner said organising the settlement deals nullifies the use of courts. “Defilement and rape cases have no place in Kangaroo courts,” Rotich said. He cited Kiomo-Kyethani ward, where some villagers held a Kangaroo court after a child was raped. “If the suspect is free, what will happen to the child,” Rotich said. He told parents not to take money to remain quiet.   Click here for the latest political news
