Looking down from the wall of the Hyena dam, I watched as some giraffe lined up to drink out of a tiny pool of water below the dam, seeming to prefer water that has been filtered to some extent, cleaner than the dam water contaminated by human settlements upstream. It is quite a difficult and awkward action for a giraffe to bend down and drink. Giraffe continue to amaze me. It is interesting to note that in their very long neck, there are only seven vertebrae, the same as humans. They have a unique and amazing design to control their blood pressure. The circulatory system has several adaptations for its great height. The heart, which can weigh more than 11kg and measures about 60cm long, generating approximately double the blood pressure required for a human to maintain blood flow to the brain. Therefore, the wall of the heart can be as thick as 7.5cm. In the upper neck, a rete mirabile (wonderful network) prevents excess blood flow to the brain when the giraffe lowers its head. Jugular veins also contain special valves to prevent blood flowing back into the head from the inferior vena cava and right atrium while the head is lowered. There are three types of giraffe found in Kenya: Maasai, Reticulated and Rothchilds.Maasai giraffe are found in the Nairobi area. To me, it appears God also showed us some heavenly humour when the giraffe was created, with its long neck and amusing expressions. The Swahili name for a giraffe is “twiga”. Is it coincidence, then, that they eat so many twigs, or maybe mankind has not twigged yet? Giraffe are truly amazingly and incredibly designed.  Take time to visit the Nairobi National Park and appreciate creation in more detail.
