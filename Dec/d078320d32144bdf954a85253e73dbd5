Woes at Nairobi Water volleyball teams has seen the women’s side lose three of their key players to the newly-formed Mombasa-based EPZ. Long-serving setter, Everline Asiko, middleblocker Praxdes Wekesa and opposite-hitter Clare Wamalwa left the water girls after  securing employment at the textile company. There has been player apathy at the club since the mother company have been not paying players their allowances in time. This has made (non-salaried) players to depend on handouts to survive. The team qualified for the national league play-offs — even after skipping the final circuit of the regular season — but the company could not send the girls for top teams’ showdown in Mombasa. Head coach Patrick Owino is a worried of an uncertain future, not knowing whether he’ll have quorum for next season. “We are not terminating any player contracts (for those who have), and the decision to recruit or not will depend on whether we are going to lose any more players. We will have a clear picture in January when the team reconvenes for the 2018 season,” said Owino, a former KCB and Forest Rangers’ player. Meanwhile, former women’s national champions and five-time African holders Kenya Prisons have vowed to bolster their side as they seek to recapture the title during the forthcoming campaign. The title eluded the wardresses for the second season in a row thanks to Japheth Munala’s charges at Kenya Pipeline. With Prisons’ experienced, dependable and celebrated setter Jane Wacu away in Seychelles, coach David Lung’aho should angling to fill the journey-girl’s place with a young talent. Lung’aho, the national volleyball technical director, confirmed that he will be fortifying his unit by bringing in three more players. “We’ll be bringing to our camp a setter, middleblocker and a leftattacker all from the schools system. We will disclose their names in due course,” said Lung’aho, the former national team coach.
