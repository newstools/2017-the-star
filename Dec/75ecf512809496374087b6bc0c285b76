Police on Saturday cancelled Transparency International’s planned procession to mark International Day against Corruption in Nairobi. TI Kenya executive director Samuel Mbithi said no reason was given. The event has been marked globally for the last 14 years. He said they notified Nairobi police commander Japheth Koome three weeks ago. Mbithi said he told them to write to OCSs in areas where the walk will be held and they complied. But Parliament police station commander and his Central police counterpart refused to allow the procession. Mbithi said no issue was raised by police until Saturday morning. “We were told to carry on with preparations and were assured of security. Some officers said we could proceed with the walk while others said we can’t. “We did not defy the contradicting orders. We don’t know where they were coming from. They seemed to have come have come from above because the officers took a tough position,” Mbithi said. “We don’t understand why our walk was cancelled, yet others were taking place. We will take it up with the police since we had other activities going on in Kisumu, Mombasa and other parts of the country without interruption,” Mbithi said. He said police from Kilimani and Capital Hill had arrived to escort them. Mbithi said there were no reasons given for the cancellation of the event marked globally for the last 14 years. He said a police officer told them there is intelligence the walk might be infiltrated by elements out to cause chaos. The 6km procession was scheduled to begin at Freedom Corner in Uhuru Park along Kenyatta Avenue to the Argwings Kodhek junction, KNH, Upper Hill, Halle Selassie Avenue, Parliament Road, Kenyatta Avenue and back to Uhuru Park.
