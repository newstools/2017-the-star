Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati has joined calls to amend the Constitution to expand the executive to promote inclusivity in government. Speaking during the burial of his neighbour Gladys Namutembi in Kanduyi constituency on Saturday, Wangamati said the current system of winner-takes-it-all is a threat to peace and unity. "We have to amend our Constitution to accommodate more leaders in government to reflect the reality and structure of our politics," Wangamati said. He was echoing a section of religious leaders who have called for the creation of the position of Prime Minister and two Deputy Prime Ministers. In October, the National Council of Christian Churches said creating the positions and empowering the office of Opposition leader will promote inclusivity in government. Wangamati urged President Uhuru Kenyatta and NASA leader Raila Odinga to dialogue and heal ethnic divisions in the country. He said continued wrangles were affecting the economy. "You cannot ignore the reality that Raila garnered almost half of the votes cast during the August 8 general election,” Wangamati said. He said the country's progress lies in the hands of the two leaders. Calls to abolish the current presidential system for a parliamentary structure has already received the backing of MPs from both Jubilee and NASA. National Assembly Minority leader John Mbadi told Star that reverting to the parliamentary system would cure the emotive presidential election witnessed after every five years. Majority leaders Aden Duale said it was time the country re-looked at its Constitution to rectify shortfalls.
