An acute water shortage has hit most parts of Eldoret leading to complaints during the festive season. Jimmy Kemboi, CEO of Eldoret Water Company, said a daily shortage of 15,000 cubic meters forced them to ration.  “We need more than 50,000 cubic meters of water daily for Eldoret town but we get about 35,000. We are doing all we can to deal with the shortage." Kemboi, who spoke in Eldoret on Tuesday, said they were in the process of implementing new water projects for a higher supply from next year. In Trans Nzoia, Deputy Governor Stanley Tarus said they will work closely with Nzoia Water and Sewerage Company to ensure regular supply to Kitale town and other parts “Our people have been complaining so we decided to work with Nzowasco. We have water sources that we should exploit. We supply to counties in Western...We should be the priority." Tarus said the county will deploy enforcement officers to all water installations to ensure pipes and tanks are no longer vandalised. He added the county will help the water company widen its revenue collection base so more areas get water. The DG said two drilling rigs were procured for areas without piped water. Nzowasco managing director Tom Musundi asked Kenya Power to come up with new tariffs for consumers of large a mounts of water as huge bills have affected operations. He added vandalism and illegal connections resulted in a loss of 37 per cent of water, translating to more than Sh10 million monthly. Click here for the latest political stories
