The Jubilee government is centralising power through borrowing, economist and NASA strategist David Ndii has said. Ndii and Governors Hassan Joho (Mombasa) and Amnason Kingi (Kilifi) on Sunday said Jubilee is killing devolution because it wants to retain power. Ndii said the national government borrows money but does not share it with the counties.  “But when it comes to payment, that is taken from the revenue first. So we are recentralising our finances by borrowing,” the NASA strategist said.

Ndii said the county share cannot increase because the debt service share is increasing rapidly. “It has doubled already under Jubilee and in the next year it’s going to increase by another one third,” the economist said. Joho and Kingi said the national government is yet to release county funds for August, September, October, November and December. Kingi said Kilifi last received the county share in September, while Mombasa has not received its share since July. Click here for the latest political news.
