This year’s presidential honours list has caused much negative debate on social media. The criticism on this occasion is justified. The awards are presented by President Uhuru Kenyatta “in recognition of outstanding or distinguished services rendered to the nation in various capacities and responsibilities” upon the advice of the National Honours and Awards Committee in the Office of the President. This should mean you have got to do something remarkable to deserve the award of the orders, decorations, and medals of Kenya awarded by the President of Kenya. The Head of State Commendation awards given to Githeriman and the Office of the President’s Senior Director of Innovation, Digital and Diaspora Communication Dennis Itumbi have attracted the most vociferous criticism. Just because you work at State House or support Jubilee Party should not qualify one for any award. The Awards Committee would do well to be more selective and to think of awarding Kenyans such as the team of surgeons and their assistants who separated conjoined twins Favour Karimi and Blessing Kathure in November 2016.
