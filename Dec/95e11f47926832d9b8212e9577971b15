The case against a fourth suspect in the Sh50 million theft from the Thika KCB branch has been merged with that of three others. Thika chief Magistrate Theresa Murigi yesterday accepted an application by the prosecution to have the cases consolidated. State prosecutor Stella Oyagi made the application following the appearance of the fourth suspect, Shem Karani, in court yesterday. Karani was charged with breaking and entering the bank through an underground tunnel and stealing Sh52,650,000 and other currencies. He committed the offence on diverse dates between November 18 and 20, jointly with others who were not in the court. Karani denied the charge. State prosecutor Stella Oyagi filed an application seeking the consolidation of Karani’s case with that of other suspects; Helford Munene, Charles Mwangi and Julius Ndung’u. The three were also charged with the same offence.  The case will be mentioned on December 14. The court released Karani on a Sh4 million bond with two sureties of a similar amount. Murigi directed Karani to deposit his passport in court and warned that he would not be allowed to travel without the court’s permission. The order followed an application by the prosecution to have Karani’s passport confiscated. Oyagi said the suspect was a flight risk. Karani’s lawyer John Were opposed the request and asked the court to grant his client reasonable bail terms. Karani was ordered to appear in court on December 14, alongside the other suspects. Munene, Mwangi and Ndung’u also face two other charges of handling stolen property contrary to the Penal Code. The trio were charged with dishonestly handling Sh17 million.
