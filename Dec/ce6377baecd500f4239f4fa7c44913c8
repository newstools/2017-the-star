Mt Kenya MPs have told NASA leader Raila Odinga to forget about his swearing-in plans and wait for 2022. Led by Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria, the lawmakers on Monday said politics is over and leaders should focus on development. They warned Raila against taking oath as President, saying the act amounts to treason. The MPs who were speaking during the funeral of Ruguru MCA Peter Weru at Ngorano Primary School in Mathira, Nyeri included Kanini Kega (Kieni), Anthony Kiai (Mukurwe-ini), Gichuki Mugambi (Othaya), Rigathi Gachagua (Mathira) and Nyeri Woman Representative Rahab Mukami. "He should be ready to face the full force of the law if he dare have himself sworn in," Kega said. Their words were echoed by Governor Mutahi Kahiga and assembly speaker John Kaguchia.
