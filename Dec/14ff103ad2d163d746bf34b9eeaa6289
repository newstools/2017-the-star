 At least 150 students from Kisauni constituency, who scored over 400 marks in KCPE, will get full secondary school scholarships, MP Ali Mbogo has said. Speaking on Friday, when he met the students’ parents, Mbogo said those admitted to national schools will get preference. Mbogo said the bursary will be expanded to benefit other needy students. He said he will start with those joining national schools and county schools before offering bursaries to students in colleges and vocational training institutions. “The last category is the students in special schools,” Mbogo said. Kisauni CDF chairman Khamis Mwabashiri had on Thursday told the Star that Sh8 million had been set aside for bursaries. “We are yet to get to the finer details as various schools charge different fees. However, we are sure the Sh8 million will be enough,” Mwabashiri said. The money will cater for fees for 2018. “We will review the progress at the end of the year to see how to move forward,” Mwabashiri said. Mbogo promised to boost education during his campaigns. He said education was the surest way of taming insecurity in the area. Kisauni police boss Christopher Rotich said crime had declined. He attributed the development to a close working relationship between the MP, security officers and residents.
