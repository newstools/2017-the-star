A bodaboda operator was on Saturday found murdered in Birikani village in the outskirts of Voi town, Taita Taveta County. Duncan Nyamu, 22, was found dumped near a railway line, with his mouth, hands and legs tied with a rope. Taita Taveta police commander Fredrick Ochieng said the body had serious injuries on the head. "The rider might have been strangled and later beaten with a blunt object," Ochieng said. The body was found by locals in the morning who later informed the police. It is suspected that the rider was killed on Friday night and his motorcycle stolen. The body was taken to Voi county referral hospital mortuary. The incident triggered angry protest by boda-boda riders in Voi who demanded immediate arrest of the suspects whom they claimed to know. Following the protests, one suspect surrendered himself to Voi police station while another was arrested in Muthaiga village as the operators baying for his blood. Police were forced to shoot in the air to disperse the operators who wanted to torch the suspects. The riders also stormed a police vehicle that ferried the suspect, breaking its rear windscreen. "We have been giving reports to the police about certain individuals that we suspect might not be in clean business, but little has been done to bring the culprits in to book," Voi riders association chairman Mohamed Dudu said. "The riders shall not rest until they are assured of their security. We are tired of this kind of crime and we won't sit and watch as riders die every day," he added Ochieng said the two suspects shall be charged with murder and robbery with violence.
