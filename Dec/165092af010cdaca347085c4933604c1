Uasin Gishu has banned children and student parties over Christmas due to increased abuse of drugs and alcohol and other kinds of immorality. County commissioner Abdi Hassan said clubs and hotels in Eldoret will be shut down should they be found hosting the parties. Hassan said drug dealers and some traders had planned to use the gatherings to sell drugs and alcohol to children. "We know those with such plans. There will not be any parties or meetings for youths until they go back to school next year." Speaking in Eldoret on Wednesday, the commissioner said police and the county will work closely to enforce the order and that they will cancel the licences of establishments found selling alcohol to children. Governor Jackson Mandago and DG Daniel Chemno, who attended a youth concert at Jua Kali on Tuesday, acknowledged the problem of alcohol and drug abuse by youths.

"Youths need advice. They are facing several challenges which may get them off the right path," he said, but noted they will fight them aggressively. "We are facing the challenge of illicit alcohol imported from Uganda." The Governor also asked the youth to use social media to research on constructive programmes and enroll for them, instead of wasting their efforts in controversial groups. He also asked them to identify and nurture their talents and told those interested in athletics to make use of the county-funded Chagaiya High Altitude Training Centre. "Each of us has a special gift. It is our responsibility as youth to build them through practice." Click here for the latest political news
