Let’s admit it. There’s something charming about the sheer audacity found in Willy Paul’s countless attempts and choices. Even when they look likely to fall flat, he stays winning with his character. He has bypassed the monotony that limits gospel music and continued to thrive on the numerous controversies that seem to be relentlessly chasing after him. He has always been able to slip through genres with relative ease. He’s collaborated with Jamaican reggae singer Alaine, delivered club-friendly tunes and made attempts at introducing secular themes to his music. His fans don’t even seem to know if they should continue viewing him as a gospel artiste. Well, it doesn’t matter anymore. He’s probably the most-played artiste on radio in 2017, positioning himself as one of Kenya’s most consistent musicians. With tracks like “Jigi Jigi,” “Digiri” “Tiga Wana” and his latest release, “Tempted”, he seems to have a clearer idea of his strengths: more brazen pop attempts and fewer slow tempo tunes.  Since the outset of his career, he has exhibited constant growth, always trying out different sounds. Hardly does he not release an instant hit, and when it doesn’t work for him, he knows how to bounce back. He is all about stardom, never the message. And he understands the only way he can do it is by appealing to those who matter: the pop culture. Now, most of his songs are hastily penned with only exposition in mind, but it works well for him. While some of us might still be stuck to the days of thoughtful, well-written tracks like “Lala Salama” and “You Never Know,” it is important to realise that the artiste has embraced his money-making transformation.
