Anti-terror police officers on Friday shot dead a wanted suspect at Shika Adabu in Likoni, Mombasa county. A special unit of anti-terror officers raided a house and gunned down Hamis Mzomo, alias Mure, 25. He had been trailed for years, but nothing was recovered. Mure is believed to have crossed over to Somalia to join al Shabaab alongside hundreds of other Kenyans. Likoni police boss Benjamin Rotich said the suspect returned to the country two weeks ago. Police reports indicate hooded officers raided the rental home where they shot dead the man after “a confrontation” around 3am.  He was shot three times in the legs. One bullet hit his head during the operation that involved more than 16 officers. Mure was living in a single-room house with his wife, Mwajuma Hamis. Sources indicate Mure is among Kenyans fleeing from Somalia following continued airstrikes against al Shabaab terrorists. The recruits have been accused of spying for the US Central Intelligence Agency and others targeting the militants’ camps in Somalia. Early this year, Kenyans Yusuf Hassan and Ahmed Nur were executed by al Shabaab’s firing squad in Buq Aqable, in the Hiran region. Police say he was part of the Jaysh Ayman elite squad, made up of many Kenyans carrying out terror attacks in the country, especially along the border town of Lamu and northern Kenya. However, the family said he travelled to Tanzania for business, but they did not disclose the nature of his work. The family said the officers killed an innocent man, instead of arresting him and investigating, as the law dictates. Mwajuma said the officers dragged her husband from the room after shooting him in the legs and went ahead to execute him. “He had surrendered and had been immobilised when the officer went ahead to pump the bullet in his head, killing him instantly,” she said.
