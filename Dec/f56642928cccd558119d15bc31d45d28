The government is to start rebuilding Elgeyo Marakwet roads using Sh4.97 billion following massive destruction by heavy rains, a state official has said. County commissioner Fredrick Ndambuki yesterday said the Bugar-Korkitony, Chugor-Chesongoch and Moiben-Kapcherop roads are to be tarmacked during this financial year. In October and last month, downpours disrupted transport in the region. Mangoe traders suffered huge losses as their fruits rotted on farms. Ndambuki said tenders have been awarded for the construction of the Sh873.3 million Chugor-Chesongoch-Tot road. Thirty kilometre Bugar-Korkitony road, which is part of the Iten-Kapsowar road not completed in 2016, will cost the state Sh1.2 billion, he said. The Moben-Chebororwa-Kapcherop-Kachibora road will be tarmacked for Sh2.9 billion.
