Kenyans travelling this festive season are likely to pay more for transport following an increase on the cost of fuel as announced yesterday by the Energy Regulatory Commission. According to the statistic given by the regulator, the prices of super petrol and diesel have increased this month by Sh1.47 and Sh0.03 per litre respectively. Kerosene increased by Sh0.19 per litre. Following the increase, the cost of super petrol will now retail at Sh100.89 in Mombasa, Sh104.17 in Nairobi and Sh104.88 in Nakuru between today and January 14, 2018. Within the same period, the cost of diesel will retail at Sh89.17 in Mombasa, Sh92.44 in Nairobi and Sh93.36 in Nakuru, while that of Kerosene will retail at Sh68.65 in Mombasa and Sh71.74 and Sh72.27 in Nairobi and Nakuru respectively. “The changes in this month’s prices have been as a consequence of the average landed-cost of imported fuel,” ERC director general Pavel Oimeke said. A statement from the regulator noted that the average landed-cost of imported super petrol increased by 4.21 per cent from $610.50 (Sh63,186) per tonne in October 2017 to $636.22 (Sh65,848.77) per tonne in November 2017. Diesel increased by 0.55 per cent from $540.66 (Sh55,958.31) per tonne $543.63 (Sh56,265.75) per tonne while the average landed cost of imported kerosene increased by 3.58 per cent from $559.58 (Sh57,916.53) per tonne to $579.64 (Sh59,992.74) per tonne. An analysis of the retail pump prices in the last three months show that the cost of fuel has been on upward trend with the cost of super petrol increasing by Sh4.72 since September while that of diesel and kerosene increased by Sh 4.73 and Sh6.18 respectively. The situation is likely to worsen in 2018 as the World Bank has predicted an increase in oil prices to $56 (Sh5, 796) a barrel from $53 (Sh5, 485.5) which is the current price. The bank has attributed the likely increase to a steadily growing demand, agreed production cuts among oil exporters and stabilising U.S. shale oil production. However, to mitigate the effect of the global petroleum prices to the local prices, the commission said plans are underway to establish a stabilisation fund to help control the situation. “Our plan is that when the country is benefitting from reduced cost of fuel products from the international market, we build the fund, and when the prices go high, we withdraw from that fund and pass the benefits on to consumers,” Oimeke told the Star.
