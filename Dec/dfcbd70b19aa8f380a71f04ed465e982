Scientists should focus on research that responds to business needs, a state officer has said.  Alice Kaudi, secretary in the Ministry of Environment, said people will find value in science if it develops products and services that can be sold by businesses.  She spoke on Saturday during the UN Environment Assembly in Gigiri, Nairobi. “When this need is met, businesses will be able to fund research, which is poorly funded in this country,” she said. “We need to work closely with universities and research institutions so they understand the need to look for practical solutions to the problems affecting our people. We must always remember the three components of science, policy and business.” The National Treasury allocated less than one per cent of the country’s GDP for research in the 2017-18 Budget. Kaudi said a partnership between science, policy and business is crucial. Businesses should be able to work on a product from the design to the disposal level, bearing in mind the three concepts of reduce, reuse and recycle, she said. Kaudi said this will ensure less waste in the environment, but added the government must provide a business-friendly environment. “Policy should support businesses and their profitability. It should also support adequate financing of science and research,” she said at the forum, which advocated a pollution-free planet.
