Comedian Njugush is always goofing around and making jokes on right about anything, and we love every bit of it. He has shed light on how tough life is and how he wishes he was young again. In the note he jots down, he remembers all the memories of being a youngster who did not have to pay bills, and also about taking up some of the jobs we do. Taking to social media, he shared a photo of him back in the day when he was in high school, but the caption is what takes the crown. "This is me every Monday morning trying to figure if I really need this job aki why did we grow up saa hii ningekua bado napigania rubber ya red na kuangalia watch nijue how far breaktime is, or ningekua nafanya exercise 2 ya English aid but i just rem sijaenda gym for exercise aki ya nani growing up was a trap."
