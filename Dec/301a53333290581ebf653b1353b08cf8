Kenya Airways has advertised Engineer and technician positions a day after 140 employees were sacked for going on strike. The technical staff were dismissed after they downed their tools over pay. Among those dismissed are employees in charge of base and line maintenance, technical workshops, cabin and in-flight entertainment, multi-crew cooperation and technical assistance. Read: KQ sacks 140 technical staff after strike over pay "Applications are invited from suitably qualified candidates for engineers and technicians," KQ said in a notice on Friday. The engineers will be responsible for carrying out and certifying all inspections, repairs and replacement tasks on aircraft and aircraft systems. Kenya Airways said more details on the profile can be found on their website. Deadline for the application is December 15. The technical operators went on a go-slow on Wednesday to push for salary increases, threatening massive flight cancellations and disruption of services. In a letter to chief executive Sebastian Mikosz on November 16, the technical team said the matter was resolved by the board in December last year and funds released. But the technical director has reportedly not released the funds to date. The workers told The Star they resorted to a go-slow after unsuccessful efforts to discuss the matter with management, which they said ignored calls for a meeting.
