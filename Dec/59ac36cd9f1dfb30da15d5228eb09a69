The counties’ financial troubles could soon be over if President Uhuru Kenyatta signs a crucial Bill that will compel the National Treasury to release funds to the regional governments. Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka yesterday told the House the National Assembly had approved the County Allocation of Revenue (Amendment) Bill to alleviate the cash crunch in the counties. “I received a communication from the National Assembly Speaker on the passage of the Senate’s County Allocation Revenue Bill, 2017 last Thursday. I will process the Bill and submit it to the President for assent,” Lusaka said. The counties’ Sh329 billion allocation for the 2017-18 financial year was supposed to be released in July. The delayed release has caused suffering in the counties, with governors threatening to sue the state. The counties were supposed to receive Sh77.4 billion in the first quarter. Governors have blamed Treasury CS Henry Rotich for the delay. Rotich denied the blame, saying there were contradictions between the disbursement schedule and the County Allocation of Revenue Act. The Council of Governors chairman Josephat Nanok, demanded an urgent resolution of the impasse. He accused the national government of holding county operations to ransom. “The delay defeats the spirit of devolution as contemplated in the Constitution,” Nanok said. Attorney General Githu Muigai had advised that the Senate’s approved schedule be amended to conform to the law. The delay was occasioned by the wait for that amendment.  Nanok said the Senate to the National Treasury, a schedule different from that contained in the Third Schedule of Cara.
