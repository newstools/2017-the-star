Trouble is brewing at Kwambira trading centre in Limuru after the county announced plans to convert part of garage to a parking bay. Garage operators have resisted the move, and vowed to protect their working space, saying there is ample parking. Limuru Central MCA Joseph Kahenya said the government gets very little revenue from the trading centre, but with better planning it can collect a lot of money from parking. Kahenya said if a modern parking lot is built, the mechanics will still have their workspace, while the parking lot will improve business at the centre.  “We have been having idle space near the garage. We will not use all the space, but what we want is a parking bay, especially for lorries,” Kahenya says. “For many years, we have had long-distance lorry and trailer drivers spending the night at hotels here, but the government does not charge anything for parking. It is high time we all support this noble idea,” the MCA said. He spoke during Jamhuri Day cerebrations at Kwambira market, accompanied by deputy county commissioner David Kiprop, police boss Eunice Githure and AP commander Gitonga Gathumi.  However, garage chairman Peter Ndung’u urged the county not to interfere with their workspace, which they have occupied for many years.  Ndung’u said the garage, which has more than 100 mechanics, was started in the 1960s so the county should look for land elsewhere.
