Western envoys have backed clerics and the private sector’s proposal for a six-month dialogue between Jubilee and NASA to start early next month. US, UK and German diplomats, who have been pushing for dialogue between NASA leader Raila Odinga and President Uhuru Kenyatta, yesterday said the planned talks will end looming ethnic and political divisions. Ambassadors Robert Godec (US), Nic Hailey (UK) and Jutta Frasch (Germany) on their embassies’ Twitter handles said open, transparent and sustained dialogue will enable Kenya realise its full potential in all spheres.

Raila and Uhuru’s clashing dialogue agenda have put them at loggerheads, making it difficult to end the political stalemate arising from the disputed August 8 General Election and the October 26 repeat presidential polls. Raila wants the discussion to be premised on electoral justice for Kenyans to go back to the ballot to elect their head of state, adding NASA does not recognise Uhuru’s presidency. But Uhuru insists the election period is over and he will only dialogue with Raila on development matters.
