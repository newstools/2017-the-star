The High Court has dismissed an application by former Kirinyanga Senator Dickson Karaba (pictured) to have the judge handling his petition disqualified over bias. Justice Abigail Mshila declined to recuse herself, saying the application lacked merit as the proceedings had been done according to the law. Karaba had made an application to stay proceedings in the main petition pending the hearing and determination of the application. The former legislator was seeking orders that the IEBC be compelled to produce the list of registered voters for Kirinyaga county. He was also seeking to be furnished with the register of votes for 689 polling stations. The petitioner disputes the credibility, integrity and accuracy of the election data and, by extension, the entire results. Â
