The new season of benchmarking is here. And the first off the blocks are the Kitui Members of the County Assembly, who flew to the Coast with their Governor, Charity Ngilu, for induction. If not curbed, this waste of public resources is likely to be repeated. In the first five years of devolution, MCAs earned international notoriety for gallivanting all over the world in the name of benchmarking.  Such trips see our elected leaders ingratiate themselves with the pleasures of this world at the expense of the taxpayer. There is little to show for it except empty coffers and scandal. Why are the good governor and MCAs of Kitui not proud of Kitui? Would it not be suitable and cheaper to hold an induction in Kitui to build the water-stressed county’s economy? What happened to Mrs Ngilu’s ‘Buy Kitui, Build Kitui’ initiative?  Ngilu told the MCAs: “Unless we agree that we are going to have a paradigm shift, we will not be able to develop Kitui county together.” That should start now.
