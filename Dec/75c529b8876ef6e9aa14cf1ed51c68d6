Residents of Karai trading center in Naivasha were treated to an early Christmas after a lorry ferrying beer was involved in an accident. The group and motorists using the Nairobi-Nakuru Highway scrambled for the beer paralysing transport along the busy route on Sunday. Overwhelmed police officers watched from a distance as the old and the young fought for the drinks. The lorry which was carrying over dozens of beer cases was destined to Naivasha from Nairobi at the time of the accident occurred. "The driver was trying to avoid hitting an incoming car when the lorry lost control and veered off the road before rolling," John Mwangi, a witness, said. "On impact, the beers were thrown out of the lorry leading to the scramble by the members of the public." In a separate accident, a man died instantly while three others were injured after two lorries collided on the Naivasha-Mai Mahiu road. The accident adversely affected the flow of traffic before police removed the wreckage. Witnesses said the lorries were speeding. The injured were admitted to Naivasha sub-county hospital after the midday accident. Naivasha sub-county commissioner Isaac Masinde asked motorists to be cautious while using the road. "Traffic along the two major roads is very heavy at the moment and we are asking motorists to be extra cautious and avoid careless overtaking."
