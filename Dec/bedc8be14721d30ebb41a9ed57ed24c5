Ngumu Tupu activists want Msambweni MP Suleiman Dori to resign if he is not happy in the party. The group took issue with Dori utterances that the party has sidelined coastal MPs in allocation of positions threatening that he will go where there is "light". Dori said earlier this week that he apologizes for leading his people to NASA and blamed the coalition for reaping alone at night and leaving coast people behind despite the many votes they got at the region. Hassan Chitembe chairperson of Ngumu tupu movement told Dori that they are aware that he is planning to join Jubilee asking him to resign and contest his seat with the party that treats him better. " You cannot tell us anything my friend as we have known that you want to go to jubilee but you're looking for excuses. Do not hide, you're free as you have done nothing for the party in your region," said Chitembe. Chitembe said that since Dori inception in ODM, the party offices in the county have been closed telling him that he hasn't done anything for the party. "Your are not a staunch supporter of ODM but you used it as a ladder to reach where you are. We are telling you to resign and have a by election then we will see who will carry the day," he added.
