Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho has
refuted claims that he colluded with the electoral body to be
declared winner of the August 8 vote. Joho told the court hearing a petition against his election that he did not canvass IEBC for favours. He noted on Wednesday that the commission is a free and independent
institute which carried out its mandate without interference or
orders from anyone. "IEBC did a wonderful job in the
Mombasa elections, especially for the governor seat," he said. Read: Omar petition: IEBC defends Joho's win in Mombasa race  Joho said he was issued with a
certificate after he beat his rivals, including Hassan Omar, by a
big margin. He revealed he was present during
the declaration at the Bandari college tallying center but could
not remember whether he signed the declaration forms. "I cannot remember whether I am the
one who signed the declaration form or my chief agent did," he said while testifying before Judge Lydia Achode. Asked why he did not annex forms
37b and 37C issued to him by the IEBC, Joho said it was not his job to
present evidence to the court on behalf of the petitioner. The Governor said that attaching them to his
affidavits would amount to looking for evidence which the petitioner could search by himself. He noted this would also be viewed as
introducing new evidence before the court. Joho further
informed the court he was not in a position to know whether all
forms 37D were received at the county tallying center before he was
declared. "That question should have been put before the IEBC official," he said. Also read: Omar's 7 witnesses thrown out from anti-Joho petition  Click here for the latest political news
