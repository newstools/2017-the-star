The 2017 Kenya Volleyball Federation best server, Sarah Osanya of Western Bombers, has set her sights on donning the national stripes in the near future. Osanya, whose team made the national playoffs on their debut season, following the withdrawal of Nairobi Water, said she is only getting started in her quest to break into the Malkia Strikers’ line up. The left-attacker was honoured with the best server award, which she says is a culmination of hardwork and discipline. “It came to me as surprise when I was handed the best server trophy, bearing in mind that my team were making a debut at the event. The trophy is a motivation to my teammates and the coaches as well,” said the 27 year old. “Its every players’ wish to one day play for the national team and I am not any different. I will strive and make myself even better and hopefully I will receive that call up.” Osanya, the team captain and a big-time admirer national team skipper, Mercy Moim, however, revealed she has had some approaches from the top teams but insists she will not rush into making a move. However, she remained tight-lipped on her suitors, claiming her allegiance for now is to the Western Kenya-based outfit. “It’s too early to make a move. We are off season, to re-evaluate myself as a player and see where I went wrong and what I did right during the 2017 season,” said Osanya. “Whether I will move to another club in 2018, only time will tell.” Team’s coach and celebrated former national team player, Dorcas Ndasaba said Osanya deserves the accolades, adding that it will be fulfilling to see one of her players earn a national call up. “When a player from your camp bags a trophy, not only does the player receive the praise but it also trickles down to the technical bench and I am happy one of my own was homoured,” said Ndasaba who also double up as the national women’s assistant coach.
