A section of opposition MCAs have vowed to work with Nairobi Governor Sonko to ensure efficient service delivery to the people. This was revealed during a VIP treat at the Governor's Mua home, a function that at least  20 ward representatives from both NASA and Jubilee attended. The MCAs were hosted to a dinner on Saturday before being given items including food and clothes for their people.

"Sonko is a godly person who does not fear individuals but has respect for human life and no boundaries in terms of service delivery. Why can't we give him the support he needs to deliver the leadership that Nairobi deserves?" said an MCA who sought anonymity. "I am willing to work round the clock to change the political misconceptions in my ward. Jubilee Party has majority support in Nairobi. What we should do is shelve personal ambitions and collaborate for service delivery."
