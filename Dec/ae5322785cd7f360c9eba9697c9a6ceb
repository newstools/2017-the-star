Plans to upgrade the Lanet Airstrip in Nakuru to an international airport have begun. According to Governor Lee Kinyanjui, the military facility next to the Kenya Military Academy will be converted into a public utility for use by civilian aircraft. The expansion by both the national and county governments leaves a lot to ponder. What is the objective of another airport an hour and half drive (157kms) from Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in the capital city? Is it to draw international tourists to Nakuru and the outlying areas or to export flowers and other agricultural produce to the international market? Naivasha, the flower capital, is only an hourâ€™s drive from Nairobi. Refrigerated trucks drive to JKIA because of its daily flights to Amsterdam. Nakuru lacks the strategic value and the plans recall the ambitious Eldoret International Airport which was promoted as a project to bolster tourism and exports but has attracted mostly smugglers evading tax. With the planned extension of the SGR past Nakuru, it would be worthier to invest the money in a dual carriageway to Kisumu.
