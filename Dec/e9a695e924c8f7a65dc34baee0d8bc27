Angry youths burnt down a lorry after it knocked down a boda boda rider at Tartar junction on the Kitale-Kapenguria highway on Friday evening. Residents also barricaded the road in protest, paralysing transport for hours. The lorry was heading to Kitale from Chepareria when it collided with the motorcycle killing its rider. The accident happened a few metres from a police road block. The driver was roughed up by angry youths but traffic police officers managed to rescue him. Police fired tear gas at the protesting residents and cleared the road. Isaac Rotich, a resident, said about five accidents have been reported in the area since the beginning of the year. Locals faulted traffic officers of failing to curb accidents despite placing road blocks. They asked the county government to erect speed bumps on the road. More than 150 people have died in road accidents in December. Earlier in the week there were two multiple car accidents in Bungoma and Sachangwan.
