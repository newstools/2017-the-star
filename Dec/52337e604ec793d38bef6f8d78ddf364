Nakuru MCAs have threatened to impeach Speaker Joel Maina, Clerk Joseph Malinda and Majority leader Stanley Karanja over loans and mortgages. The MCAs accused the three of delaying the disbursement of Sh2 million for car loans and Sh3 million for mortgages for each of them. On Thursday, they declined to go on a two month's recess until the Sh5 million is wired to their accounts. The ward representatives said they do not have enough money for the festive season.

It has been said the representatives want to secure the facilities without security as required by the Salaries and Remuneration Commission. In the last three months, they have spent more than Sh20 million on training trips and allowances. They have taken two week-long trips to Naivasha, another week-long trip to Nairobi and one of six days to Machakos for training. A senior county official said the MCAs also demanded Sh100,000 each as part of their Christmas send off package.  "These MCAs are making ridiculous demands including Christmas sendoffs for each one of them. That is impossible and unacceptable," said the official. In a circular in July, SRC noted every loan must be secured. It also stated that the periods of the loans and mortgages cannot exceed the MCAs' contractual terms.
