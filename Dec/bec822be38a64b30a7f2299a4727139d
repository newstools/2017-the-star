Hundreds of non-native residents of Mandera county have resorted to using government vehicles to travel to their homes ahead of the Christmas festivities. This follows a directive by bus companies that they will not offer services to the non-natives for fear of being targetted by Shabaab militants. The terrorist group has threatened to kill non-Muslims who use the buses. The non-natives, mostly Christians, now request lifts from police trucks travelling to Nairobi through the Moyale route. They say they look forward to visiting their families, but can’t afford flights. Travelling by road is their only option. The government withdrew armed security escort. “A return flight goes for Sh31,000. My job cannot give me the money to enable me to take a flight to Nairobi,” James Njuguna, a mason, said. Mandera county commissioner Fredrick Shisia yesterday said the non-natives will only use the Mandera-Garissa road after security is restored. Mohamed Bardad, chairman of one of the bus companies, expressed regret over the move, but added they cannot risk peoples’ lives. “We cannot expose Christian travellers to the dangers of being killed by the Shabaab,” he said yesterday. In 2014, Shabaab militants attacked a Mandera bus that was headed for Nairobi and killed at least 28 no-natives. The assailants separated passengers, targetting those they perceived to be non-Somalis and opened fire, killing them as the Somalis in the bus watched in disbelief. Most of the victims were teachers. They were on their way home for the December holidays after schools closed. In the latest situation, the non-natives have held demonstrations since Monday last week to press the government to provide escort vehicles to secure the buses.
