Zanzibar boosted their chances of qualifying to the semi-finals in the ongoing Cecafa Senior Challenge when they rallied from a goal down to thump their main land rivals Tanzania 2-1 yesterday at Kenyatta Stadium, Machakos. The win moved the Islanders to the top of Group ‘A’ with six points, two ahead of Kenya whom they face tomorrow at the same venue. Zanzibar had beaten Rwanda 3-1 in their opening Group ‘A’ game and claimed a hard fought 2-1 win over neighbours Tanzania to go top of the group with six points. Zanzibar now need three points to qualify for semis. Hemed Suleimani’s boys came from a goal down in the match dubbed “Magufuli Derby” as Tanzania had nodded the opener through Azam attacking midfielder Himid Mkami on the half an hour mark. With Zanzibar enjoying possession for the better part of the opening stanza, it was Mkami who made the difference in the 30th minute when Daniel Lyanga picked him in the box to put the ball past the custodian Mohammed Abdulrahaman. Trailing 1-0 at half time, Zanzibar returned for the final stanza strong and their quest for an equaliser paid off in the 66th minute as Kassim Khamis curled the ball into the net few yards from the edge of the box. Ibrahim Ahmada buried the winning goal in an empty net in the 77th minute when Tanzania’s stopper Salum Manula advanced to save a cross floated in by Hassan Makame but missed it, leaving his area exposed. Ahmada then tapped in ball to hand Zanzibar the second goal of the day which also served their main land brothers with bitterness and a loss too. The loss by Taifa Stars left them fourth in a five-member group with a point and risk to edged out of the tournament at group level. They play Rwanda on tomorrow before renewing their rivalry with Kenya on Monday to wrap up their Group ‘A’ fixtures.
