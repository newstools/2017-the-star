The numbers of baboons killed by motorists across the country on a daily basis are on the rise, with the Northern Corridor identified as the worst-hit. More than 15 baboons are hit and killed by speeding motorists along the corridor. George Kibanya, of the Conserve the Baboon campaign initiative, said matatus are the greatest cause of the animals’ deaths on the roads. He said areas along the Limuru-Mai Mahiu-Naivasha-Gilgil highway, where the animals stay, have registered many deaths. “Some of these speeding vehicles are PSVs and motorcycles that should use the upper route through Kwa Mbira, Kijabe and Fly Over,” Kibanya said. Kibanya, also the Alcare Kenya Limited CEO, urged the Kenya Wildlife Service and the Kenya National Highways Authority to work together and put up signboards to warn drivers of the presence of the animals.
