An Embu man who attempted to burn his nephew to death for reaccepting his estranged wife has the hearing of his case set for February 17 next year. Embu senior resident magistrate Vincent Nyakundi has fixed the date. Francis Gichovi has denied dousing his nephew, Gregory Kimanthi, with paraffin and attempting to set him ablaze. He appeared before Nyakundi yesterday for mention of his case in which he has denied attempting to kill Kimanthi on December 10 in Gatituri village, Embu West subcounty, following a quarrel over Kimanthi’s wife. The prosecution has lined up several witnesses, including Kimanthi, to testify. Gichovi denied pouring paraffin on the complainant and threatening to kill him by uttering the words ‘Nitakuchoma uishe kabisa’ (I’ll burn you completely). He is out on Sh50,000 bond. Gichovi is alleged to have beaten up Kimanthi’s wife and tried to chase her away. The wife had returned after separating with Kimanthi for a while. The spat prompted a quarrel between Gichovi and Kimanthi. Gichovi reportedly grabbed a container of paraffin and doused Kimanthi with it. He is said to have threatened Kimanthi for allowing his wife to return, accusing her of “being badly behaved”. Court records say Kimanthi was rescued by other family members, who reported the matter to the Itabua police station. Gichovi was then arrested and charged with the offence. Meanwhile, Embu county commissioner Esther Maina has condemned rampant incidents of burning suspects alive. She warned that culprits will be prosecuted. Maina and Manyatta MP John Muchiri expressed anger that residents have formed a bad and illegal habit.
