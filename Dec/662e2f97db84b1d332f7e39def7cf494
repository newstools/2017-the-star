Lecturers and their employers are expected to meet today to sign a return-to-work formula to end the strike that enters its 27th day. This comes after a meeting set for Tuesday failed to take place. Sources within the union told the Star yesterday that the Inter-Public University Council Consultative Forum had not finished preparing a return-to-work formula and other demands had yet to be met. The meeting will focus on the 2017-21 CBA and conclusion of the individual university CBAs. Uasu secretary general Constantine Wasonga yesterday said the meeting is to determine whether the union will call off the strike. “We’ll be meeting with IPUCCF to deliberate on the demands that have yet to be met and from this we will give the way forward as a union,” he said.
