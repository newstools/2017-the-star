Nyandarua Woman Representative Faith Gitau on Monday led 12 women MCAs in condemning rampant Female Genital Mutilation across the county. Their condemnation followed the publication by the Star of the plight of two girls from Rutara in Ol Kalou, were tricked into undergoing the cut by their mother. The woman was arrested. The Star has learnt that parents are paid handsomely for every girl they bring forward to undergo the cut. The circumcision is secretly conducted in Ngoorika, Rutara and Kaguunda villages in Ol Kalou. Gitau said the practice is retrogressive and had no place in modern society. “My office will fight to ensure FGM is eliminated. It cannot continue under my watch,” Gitau said. She said that in January, she will organise civic education workshops aimed at eradicating the crime. “We have conducted our research. We know what is happening and those behind it. We condemn them,” nominated MCA Wanjiru Ndirangu said. Ndirangu said they will establish a hotline for residents to inform authorities about mutilation. Jecinta Githae asked women to advise their girls and resist FGM. Nurse Nyokabi Muriithi, who was also with the women leaders, said FGM has no benefits.  “It only ruins the female organ besides being extremely painful, especially when done by backstreet traditionalists,” Muriithi said. Gitau urged men to help fight FGM.  "No woman can take their daughter for circumcision without the husband’s consent,” she said.
