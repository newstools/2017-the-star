Deputy President William Ruto on Friday urged the county governments to ensure every citizen has a medical cover with the NHIF. He said the cover will help those from poor families to get better health services. Ruto said the government is working to ensure everyone has a medical cover in the next five years. “The cost of treatment in our hospitals is still a big problem. We want everyone to have a medical cover. The county government of Marsabit, for example, pays for medical cover for 10,000 needy people,” he said during the funeral service of former Kitui West MP Francis Nyenze, at the Christ is the Answer Ministries in Karen, Nairobi.

He was firm, forthright and an active player in bipartisan dialogue. His death is a great loss,” he said. Nyenze’s elder sister recalled moments he cherished with his brother, saying he was the kind of person who would find solutions to difficulties, leading to his nickname Mr Fix it. Other leaders who attended the service included Mavoko MP Patrick Makau, former Kitui Senator David Musila, Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang’ula and Kitui Senator Enock Wambua. Nyenze, 60, died on December 6 after a long battle with colon cancer — a disease that caused his lungs to weaken, resulting in a pneumonia infection during campaigns for the August 8 election. Nyenze will be buried on Tuesday in Kyondoni, Kabati. Click here for latest political news
