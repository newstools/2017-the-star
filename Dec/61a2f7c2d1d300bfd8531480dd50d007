The Education ministry may release the KCSE exam results next week. Examiners finished marking the tests this week and the Kenya National Examination Council is currently compiling the results and release them to schools. Earlier, communication from the Knec indicated the exam results would be released before end of this month. The marking of the exam started immediately after the conclusion of the exam on December 3. The marking was being done in about 20 centres in Nairobi and its environs. Sources from the ministry on Friday said, CS Fred Matiang’i is expected to present a brief of the results to President Uhuru Kenyatta at State House on Monday, after which the results will be made public. “In the beginning of this week, about 200,000 papers were yet to be marked, which was a small number that was completed before the end of week and the results sent to the Knec headquarters,” the source told the Star. The announcement will come earlier than usual as promised by the CS to give way for admissions to universities. The admission is set to commence early next year. This year, 615,773 candidates sat KCSE exam in 9,350 centres. The number was a five per cent increase from last year’s 577,253 candidates. Of this number, 1,404 were special needs students. The exam was conducted under strict guidelines to curb cheating and malpractice. The examiners were restricted from taking away answer scripts, marking schemes or any marking materials from the marking rooms or centres or bring in any unauthorised materials.
