As the sun sets every day, so another nocturnal world awakens, a world that most humans see and hear very little of.  The Nairobi National Park is teeming with many species of wildlife, of which day visitors only see certain species. But the darkness of the night is full of mystery, as species arise from their daytime slumber. Those who enter the park very early in the morning, or when it’s cool and cloudy, have the possibility of catching a glimpse of such species.  Perhaps a spotted hyena crossing the road, or a montane nightjar in the road … A flash of a disappearing leopard… Or maybe a rare sighting of an aardwolf or a serval cat. Maybe a pride of lions with a fresh kill? Many years ago, a bantu ranger in the Kruger park said something like this to my father: “I don’t understand the city people. They tell me they want to see many cats, but the city people like to sleep very long at night when the cats are awake.  In the daytime when the sun is already high, the city people drive to find the cats, but many cats are already sleeping and hiding, so the city people come back and say “they see nothing”. So these city people, they are always chasing the night. There are exceptions when nocturnal species are active on cloudy cool days and very rarely on sunny days. There is so much to be seen and enjoyed in this wonderful park, for even as the night ends, so another exciting day awaits.  So why not get up very early and enter into the park. Perhaps as you ”chase the night”, you will be rewarded with a special sighting.
