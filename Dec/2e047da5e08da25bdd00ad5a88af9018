They had hanged themselves on mango tree beside their house,” Tum said. The police boss said they could not immediately establish why the couple decided to commit suicide. “It is very sad that two people can agree to die together, a death that can be avoided. We are still investigating why they resorted to killing themselves,” Tum said. He said security officials in Homa Bay County record at least a case of suicide every week. Tum said the trend is very worrying as it will leave many orphans in poverty. “A number of people who kill themselves have children. It is unfortunate that many orphans have been left with their relatives, which has promoted to increased rates of poverty,” he added. He asked disputing families to hold talks as a way of averting from such cases. The bodies of the two deceased are in Homa Bay hospital mortuary for postmortem. The incident came just three days after two men committed suicide over a family dispute.   Click here for the latest political news
