 The Supreme Council of Kenya Muslims organising secretary Abdullahi Salat wants the Ministry of Education to address the issue of hijab worn by Muslim students. Salat said despite the judgment by the Court of Appeal in Nyeri directing the ministry put in place policies to ensure no discrimination takes place against Muslim girls, harassment is still rife in most schools at provincial and national levels. For instance, St Paul Kiwanchani, a school under the sponsorship of the Methodist Church in Isiolo, successfully petitioned the High Court to ban Muslim girls from wearing the hijab. Salat said the ministry has remained mum on the issue. “This amounts to discrimination and, as Muslim leaders, we will not keep quiet,” he said. Salat said school boards lack proper representation of Muslim faithful, hence lack people to advise them on the issue. He demanded that the schools involved address the matter from January, failing which Supkem will shame them.
