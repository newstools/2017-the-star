A 12-year-old boy has been put in isolation at the Maralal GK prison after officials discovered that police overestimated his age. Police, in their warrant, stated that the boy, who was sentenced three months for stealing a goat worth Sh3,000 on December 14, was an adult. Charles Mwangangi, the officer in charge of Maralal prison, said they wrote a letter to the county children department requesting for age assessment. This followed their suspicion that the convict was a minor. The DPP has also written to the Nanyuki High court for a review of the boy's custody. "We contacted a primary school in Wamba which confirmed that the convict was a pupil at the institution," Mwangangi said on Friday. "The boy is still here but isolated from the other convicts, this is the first such a case we have received this year." Jane Kabiro, Samburu children's coordinator, said the boy's birth certificate shows that he was born in 2005.   Click here for the latest political news
