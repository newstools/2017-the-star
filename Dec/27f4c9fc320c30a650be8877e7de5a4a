Kenya’s Lawrence Cherono and Brigid Kosgei have now turned their focus on London Marathon after winning Honolulu crowns last weekend. The duo returned home to a heroic welcome on Thursday amid song and dance as friends, relatives and fans jammed Eldoret International Airport to welcome them. Last weekend, Cherono won Honolulu Marathon in a course record of 2:08.27. This followed his feat in Amsterdam Marathon last October, where he also ran a new course record. He beat three-time Amsterdam marathon winner Wilson Chebet to second place in 2:09.55 with Vincent Yator completing the podium in 2:10.37. Cherono said next year’s London Marathon will be his next stop and exuded confidence of a better performance owing to his road experience. “It is good to note that I have achieved success in many of the big city marathons and my focus now has shifts to the prestigious ones like London,” he said. “I will begin in London next year and I hope to intensify my training after this festive season. In the meantime, I will start with light training to keep myself in shape,” he added. Kosgei also said London Marathon would be her next target. In Honolulu, she led Nancy Laptop and Joyce Jepkurui to the podium in that order in a course record of 2:22.15. She broke 11-year record previously held by Russian Lyubov Denisova. “I was never sure of victory but after leading in the last 10km without any competition, I knew I was the winner. This has really motivated me ahead of my future assignments,” she said. Click here for the latest political news
