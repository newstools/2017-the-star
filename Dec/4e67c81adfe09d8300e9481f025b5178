  Manyatta constituency election officers altered votes for MP John Muchiri and petitioner Justus Mugo, a court was told on Thursday.   The court was told in several polling stations presiding officers changed results in Forms 35As and either increased or decreased them in favour of the MP or against him before they were transferred to Forms 35Bs. The revelations were made before justice Robert Limo during the hearing of a petition by Mugo against Muchiri.  The court was told Mugo was given more votes than the ones recorded in some polling stations he was given more votes than the ones initially recorded.      Mugo is seeking scrutiny of the ballots, KIEMs kits data and a vote  recount.      Manyattta constituency returning officer Faith Mugo admitted results initially entered in Forms 35As after counting of the votes  were altered.
