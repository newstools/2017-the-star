The government will commit more funds to the United Nations Environment Programme to strengthen the institution, President Uhuru Kenyatta said yesterday. Uhuru told the Third United Nations Environment Assembly that Kenya remains committed to supporting Unep to achieve a pollution-free planet. Uhuru, who officially opened the assembly in Gigiri yesterday, said Kenya had borne the brunt of pollution. “We can now all see the consequences of the careless pollution of the past. Experts are predicting even more dire consequences if we do not act now,” Uhuru told the more than 4,000 delegates.  He said the delegates had gathered in Nairobi because they had learnt an expensive lesson that unless the environmental riches are protected by all, there can be no lasting prosperity.  “We in Kenya have learnt this lesson and have been taking appropriate mitigating actions,” Uhuru said.  Trinidad and Tobago President Anthony Carmona, Guyana’s David Granger and Samoa’s Deputy Prime Minister Mataafa Fiame attended the session. This year’s heme is “Towards a Pollution Free Planet.”
