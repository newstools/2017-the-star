Angry residents barred police from collecting the body of a woman who died under mysterious circumstances in Engineer town. They accused police of having a hand in the woman's death, saying an officer took her home while she was drunk on Sunday night. "The police asked for a blanket and covered the woman, and directed her children not to bother her as she was very drunk," said Jane Wambui, a neighbour. But on Monday morning, the women was found dead by family members. "We are suspicious of the generosity of police who instead of arresting
the woman who was drunk decided to take her home and even carry her to
her house," Wambui added. A senior officer said a postmortem will be done as investigations begin. In another incident in the town, an AP officer shot and injured a suspected robber at midnight. John Mwaniki was shot twice in the hip while breaking into a bookshop. His five accomplices managed to escape. Mwaniki is in stable condition at the Nyayo Hospital. Meshack Waithaka, a resident, said the suspects broke into the bookshop through its roof. "The suspect is a known drug peddler," he added and claimed that Mwaniki fired at police.
