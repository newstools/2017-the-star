Public and private school heads will today begin the scramble for top students as Form One selection officially begins. Education CS Fred Matiang'i is expected to open the exercise today at the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development. It will run for nine days before ending on December 12. But the ministry is yet to release guidelines for the selection. The government abolished the quota system is the placement of top scorers in this year's KCPE exams. This means selection will be done based on merit, equity and choice of schools made by the candidates. The Star has established the selection will be lenient to candidates from marginalised and hardship areas. The selection shall be done at four levels — national, extra county, county or special schools and district. “We will ensure all candidates who did well get places in the schools they deserve, but considerations will be put on areas where students experience difficult learning environment without discriminating those who have passed well even in areas with good learning environment,” a source from the ministry told the Star on phone yesterday. A total of 993718 candidates sat the exam and will all join Form One following a directive by the ministry to ensure 100 per cent transition to secondary education. 903,200 students will join public schools while 90000 will join private institutions. Some 9,848 candidates scored over 400 marks while 217,307 candidates scored between 300-400 marks. Another 529,897 scored between 201-300 marks while 234,308 scored between 101-200 marks. Last year, national schools admitted 24,795 students while extra county schools absorbed 65,331. 133,785 students joined county schools with another 492,576 others transiting to subcounty schools. Private schools took in 72,744 students with another 1,449 joining special schools. However, scramble for top schools is expected to be high after Education CS announced elimination of the quota system in placement of top scorers in this year’s KCPE. The ministry is also expected to make very slight changes from last year’s formula used in the selection and placement. The selection process shall be done at four levels — national, extra county, county or special schools and district. “We will ensure all candidates who did well get places in the schools they deserve, but considerations will be put on areas where students experience difficult learning environment but without discriminating those who have passed well even in areas termed to have good learning environment,” a source from the ministry told the Star on Sunday. This year 9848 candidates scored over 400 marks while 217307 candidates scored 300 to 400 marks, 529897 scored between 201 to 300 marks, 234308 scored between 101 to 200 marks. Last year, national schools accommodated at least 24795 while Extra counties took in 65331, county schools 133785, Sub-county schools 492576, Special schools 1449 while private schools admitted 72744 students.
