Kwale residents have complained about the water crisis. They say the county’s piped water was disconnected two weeks ago over a Sh800,000 electricity bill owed by the Kwale Water and Sewerage Company.  Technical manager Swalehe Chiduga yesterday said they would settle the bill before the day ended. He assured residents to be patient.  “The company owes KPLC. We struggled to raise the money. We’ll clear the bill and everyone will have access to clean drinking water,” he said.  Residents now rely on water points and boreholes. They have expressed concern that there could be a cholera outbreak. The price of water has shot up. Vendors sell a 20-litre jerrycan for Sh80.  “We are getting losses. We use all profits to buy water. It does not make sense,” vegetable vendor Riziki Hamadi said in Kwale town.
