Police in Parklands are investigating a city businessman for allegedly threatening patrons at a popular Westlands bar. Majid Khosrojerdi is said to have uttered racist remarks at Alchemist Hotel, Westlands, at the weekend.  He allegedly cocked his gun and threatened to shoot three patrons he had differed with. The matter was reported at Parklands police station. Khosrojerdi is said to have claimed to be a spy for a top agency, saying he is untouchable.  Gigiri police commander Vitalis Otieno told the Star on the phone on Monday investigations are ongoing. Khosrojerdi is said to be of Iranian descent and operates from Village Market. He runs a restaurant called Orchid in the food court.  But Otieno said the suspect is Kenyan. It is not clear why the management allowed an armed licensed gun holder into the premises. There is concern over the young age at which civilians are being licensed to own guns.
