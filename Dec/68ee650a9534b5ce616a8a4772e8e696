President Vladimir Putin on
Monday ordered Russian forces in Syria to start withdrawing,
saying that after a two year military campaign, Moscow and
Damascus had achieved their mission of destroying Islamic State. Putin made the announcement during a surprise visit to
Russia's Hmeymim air base in Syria's Latakia Province where he
held talks with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and addressed
Russian military servicemen. Russia first launched air strikes in Syria in September 2015
in its biggest Middle East intervention in decades, turning the
tide of the conflict in Assad's favour while dramatically
increasing Moscow's own influence in the Middle East. Putin on Monday gave the order for Russian forces to start
withdrawing to their permanent bases in Russia, the Kremlin said
on its website. "The task of fighting armed bandits here in Syria, a task
that it was essential to solve with the help of extensive use of
armed force, has for the most part, been solved and solved
spectacularly," Putin said, in remarks broadcast on Russian
television. "I congratulate you!," Putin told Russian servicemen
gathered at the base. He was also quoted as saying that Russia would keep the
Hmeymim air base as well as a naval facility at the Syrian port
of Tartous.
