Larry Madowo, like everyone, has also had his fair share of struggles. During an interview with CNN African Voices, Larry said life was tough after he lost his parents when he was just 14-years-old.  “When you grow up with almost no privilege at all, you learn to appreciate the small things. There are small miracles happening every day, and we’re living through this in Africa," Larry said. So why exactly did he decide to leave the entertainment show to cover politics?  "I want to be involved in the development of my country and my continent, and part of that is political journalism, being able to cover the difficult stories and ask the hard questions."
