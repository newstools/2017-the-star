Lamu county on Tuesday held its annual fishing competition on Lamu Island. The largest fish caught this year weighed 44kg. It was caught by Omar Hussein’s team, which was awarded Sh100,000. The competition is organised every year by the Lamu government under the Department of Fisheries, Livestock and Cooperative Development. It is an opportunity for fishermen from various parts of the Lamu archipelago to display their skills. The event is also meant to motivate them. Fishing is the key economic activity for most residents, besides being the backbone of the county’s economy. This year’s competition was the fourth. The competition was officially launched in 2014 with the main objective being to give fishermen a platform to showcase their prowess and to encourage large-scale fishing. The one-day event entails fishermen going fishing for several hours after which the winner is rewarded with cash and fishing equipment. The fisherman or team with the biggest catch is the winner. They are awarded Sh100,000 and Sh150,000. This year’s event cost the county government Sh.1.9 million. More than five tonnes of fish were caught. Fisheries, Livestock and Cooperative Development executive Abdu Godana said the administration will continue to strive to open up the sector some more. He said his office will support fishermen. “Lamu has great potential when it comes to fishing. All we need to do is empower the sector more so it can produce more,” Godana said. “The county government will sponsor fishermen to get all that they require to ply the deep seas since that’s where the most catch is.” County director of Fisheries Salim Bunu urged fishermen to embrace large-scale fishing instead of subsistence fishing. “We need to learn to do fishing for business rather than just to eat. That way livelihoods will definitely improve,” he said.
