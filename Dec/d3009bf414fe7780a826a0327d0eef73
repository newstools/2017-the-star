Leaders from West Pokot have urged county governments, NGOs and other donor agencies to nurture local talent. Woman Representative Lillian Tomitom yesterday said youth’s talent can create jobs and shun retrogressive practices and violence in the conflictprone areas in the North Rift. Tomitom said she will allocate funds to nurture youth talent. “We want youth to use their talent to bring change in the community,” she said. Tomitom attended the opening of a youth talent promotion festival at Kisii University in Kapenguria. She said tapping youth talent will reduce incidents of cattle rustling, banditry and Female Genital Mutilation (pictured).  “Youth can take part in music and dance and be at the forefront in pushing for peace,” she said.
