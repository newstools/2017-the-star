City Hall is planning to install a waste recycling plant at the Dandora dumpsite to alleviate garbage problems, Governor Mike Sonko has said. Sonko made the announcement on his social media accounts on Sunday. He said the plant, to be procured through a public-private partnership, will address Nairobi’s garbage menace.  “My government is working on the installation of a giant recycling plant at the Dandora dumpsite,” Sonko posted on Facebook. Sonko said the procurement will be transparent and that all competent companies are invited to present their proposals. Chinese company AV International has already applied for the tender. In November 2016, a German firm contracted to set up a Sh28 billion recycling plant withdrew, saying City Hall lacked a title deed for the land.
