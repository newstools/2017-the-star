Four ODM MPs have said Jubilee is planning to stop remitting devolved funds to counties which have approved the People’s Assembly Bill. They are Gladys Wanga (Homa Bay woman representative), Samuel Atandi (Alego Usonga), Lillian Gogo (Rangwe) and Walter Owino (Awendo). They said such counties are likely to suffer. Counties perceived to be NASA strongholds passed the People’s Assembly Bill to provide forums for advocating for electoral reforms in the country. Talking during a fundraiser in aid of classrooms construction at Ondicho Primary School in Rangwe on Friday, the legislators said there are plans to punish such counties by stopping their funding. Wanga (pictured) said Jubilee wants to punish the counties for making a legislation aimed at helping Kenyans at the grassroots. “There are plans by Jubilee to sideline NASA counties in resource-allocation because they passed the Bill. But we will not allow this to happen,” Wanga said. She said as NASA legislators they will not relent in the fight for electoral justice. Atandi said residents in the NASA counties will suffer from lack of essential services from their county governments if the funds are blocked. He said all Kenyans have a right to receive funds and resources from the national government since all citizens pay taxes equally.  “It would amount to mistreatment if residents of any county fail to receive government services because their county is denied funds,” Atandi said.
