Mwamba centre Billy Odhiambo could make a speedy return to the Kenya Sevens side ahead of the Sydney and Wellington World Sevens Series next month. Odhiambo suffered a shoulder injury during the Prinsloo Sevens in September but has made a speedy recovery from surgery and has rejoined the squad in training. Team Physiotherapist Lamech Bogonko said Odhiambo’s return to the team will be decided bordering on how he will react to training today and next week. “We want to push him through contact training with the rest of the squad and if he can absorb the hits and contact with other players, then it’s up to the coach to decide if he will travel to Australia and New Zealand at the end of January,” said Bogonko. He added that halfbacks, Sammy Oliech and Eden Agero, who picked slight injuries in Cape Town will be available for the next two legs of the circuit.  “The injuries were minor and they have recovered fully so they are back in training with the rest and are available for selection,” noted Bogonko Skipper Andrew Amonde has also resumed training with the squad after picking a hernia injury while on club duty with KCB during the national sevens circuit, forcing him to miss the opening legs in Dubai and Cape Town early this month. Bogonko said they are not taking chances with the injuries 2018 will be a long season with the Commonwealth Games (April) and Rugby World Cup Sevens (July) also coming up. “It’s a long season and I believe there is depth for all positions. We brought a couple of rookies to the team for the opening tournaments and they did well,” he added. The team resumes training today, train until the weekend before breaking off for the New Year festivities and resume on January 3. Kenya are in Pool B of the Sydney leg alongside Argentina, France and Wales. The 13 man team for the tournament will be named in mid next month.
