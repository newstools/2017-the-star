A raft of reforms was announced at the 13th
Annual Delegates’ Conference of Primary School Head-teachers.  Ten thousand
teachers met at the Coast from Sunday to Thursday at the Sheikh Zayed
Children’s Welfare Centre in Bombolulu.  It is a good thing that the ministry of Education is
reforming, but it needs to carry along as many people – or stakeholders – as
possible.  There are, for instance, issues around the new curriculum
and points of view abound concerning the merging of schools’ managements.
Everyone should be heard. The government conducted a pilot study of the new curriculum
in selected private and government schools earlier this year but has yet to
release its findings.  They should disclose the highlights of the curriculum’s strengths,
weaknesses, opportunities and threats. The public was involved in the pilot study and no doubt
wants to be updated on the implementation process. Public participation in policy-making is a key tenet of the
2010 Constitution and it is rarely more important than when it comes to the
education of the next generation of Kenyans.
