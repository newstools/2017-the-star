An Jubilee agent in the Embakasi East MP election on Friday told the court that he signed a result form before the presiding officer and his deputy appended their signatures. Moses Mwangi, who was acting for Babu Owino's opponent Francis Mureithi, said he did not wait for the final results for all candidates who participated in the election. "Voting went on smoothly. After we closed the polling station, we rested for 30 minutes and when darkness fall, we realised we had no lights hence signed the forms," he said. Mwangi, in his testimony before Justice Joseph Sergon, said Murethi garnered more votes than Babu adding that he sent the results of the polling station under dispute to Mureithi. "I sent the text before leaving the polling station," he said at the Milimani law court in the case filed by Mureithi on grounds the elections were marred with irregularities and violence. On Thursday, a witness in the petition absolved the Owino from claims
he attacked an ANC candidate at a polling station in the constituency. Samwel
Mwangi, who is the petitioner's agent, said the legislator did not assault the politician as claimed adding it was the MP's agents who pushed
Otieno causing him injuries. The MP, officially known as Paul Ongili, is accused of causing violence during the
August 8 election. Mureithi recently told the
court the situation saw many of his supporters fail to vote. Read: Babu Owino causes scene after Embakasi MP certificate goes missing Also read: Babu Owino to face fresh charges of assault, electoral offense Click here for the latest political news
