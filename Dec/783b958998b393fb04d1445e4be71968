ANC nominated MP Godfrey Osotsi has threatened to sue party chairman Kelvin Lunani for defamation. Lunani on Thursday said Osotsi risked losing his seat for allegedly plotting to sabotage the party. He claimed the MP was using “malicious idlers” to fight the party. Lunani accused Osotsi of being used by Jubilee Party to undermine ANC Party leader Musalia Mudavadi. Osotsi on Friday said Lunani’s words were full of malice and innuendos. Osotsi, a former party secretary general, blamed Mudavadis private secretary Kibisu Kabatesi for authoring the statement. “I have seen the statement and I know it was written by Kabatesi. We cannot run a party like this,” Osotsi told the Star on the phone. “I am going to sue him because this is defamatory,” Osotsi said.
