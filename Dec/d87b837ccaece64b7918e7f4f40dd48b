Residents expressed their displeasure after Jamhuri Day celebration organisers shifted the event venue from Mkunguni Square on Lamu Island to Mokowe town on the mainland. Usually, all national celebrations and festivals are marked and held in Lamu town and specifically at the renowned Mkunguni Square. On a few occasions, national celebrations are also marked at the Kibaki grounds within Lamu Island. However, things began changing when the county headquarters were moved from Lamu town to Mokowe on the mainland earlier this year. This means most county government activities are now held in Mokowe. This is the first time national celebrations are being held out of Lamu town and locals now say the move is meant to ‘demean’ them. Many said the move locked out the majority of residents because they cannot afford fare to and from Mokowe. It costs at least Sh300 to and from Mokowe. Residents said they were disappointed the organisers did not mention the venue of the celebration until the last minute. Ali Hussein, a trader, said had residents been informed about the venue early enough, they would have had time to save up. “We are so angry they decided to take the Jamhuri Day celebrations to Mokowe.Why would they do such a thing? For years, such events have been held here in Lamu town because it’s the heart of this entire county. Everything about Lamu is found in Lamu town. Many people attended because there wasn’t any transport needed,” he said.
