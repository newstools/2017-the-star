Government officers in Samburu county were yesterday forced to address an empty Kenyatta Stadium in Maralal town. Residents did not turn up for Jamhuri Day celebrations. Political leaders opted to hold their celebrations at Archers Post on the Samburu-Isiolo border. The dais at Kenyatta Stadium was filled with government officers, including officers from the county commissioner’s office, county security personnel and two nominated MCAs. Maralal town ward MCA Fred Kiragu was also absent. The governor’s speech was read by a subcounty administrator.  The celebrations, which were supposed to start at 9am delayed to some minutes to 1pm as the administrators waited for residents to arrive in vain. Samburu county commissioner Alfred Kinyua said 45 per cent of Samburu children do not attend primary schools. He urged parents to take their children to school. Kinyua said from next month they will be conducting patrols in search of children herding livestock. “We will use the chiefs and local administrators. Children found grazing livestock will take us to the parents and we will take them to court,” he said. Kinyua said chiefs who ensure children within their area of jurisdiction go to school will be promoted. The county commissioner added that security in the area was gradually becoming stable. However, he said Samburu North and Samburu East still face security hurdles. “We have problems in Baragoi and Wamba between the Samburus and Turkanas,” he said. He urged pastoralists, who had moved from Wamba to Baragoi in search of water and pasture, to return home so that security can be restored. The commissioner also called upon politicians to campaign against alcoholism without fear of losing support. Kinyua told security officers to enforce law and order in Maralal town, especially in bars.
