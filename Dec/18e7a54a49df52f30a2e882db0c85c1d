Siaya Senator James Orengo has told NASA chief Raila Odinga not to backtrack on his journey to State House. He said many people, including the government, will try to discourage Raila from pursuing his dream. "Like the story in the bible, do not look back lest you turn into a stone," Orengo said. He spoke during the consultative forum on the People's Assembly at Sun N' Sand Beach Hotel in Kikambala, Kilifi county, yesterday. Orengo said Kenyans have a right to speak of secession, because they have the sovereign power. He said self-rule is recognised by the UN, adding that countries like Kosovo, Eritrea, Namibia and South Sudan were created after agitation for secession. The senator dismissed as "empty talk" threat by President Uhuru Kenyatta against those championing for secession of the Coast. "Uhuru does not know what he is saying. He will be in more trouble himself," he said. Orengo said Uhuru's government does not represent Kenyans. "He only got less than 25 per cent of the votes cast on October 26," he said. "This means he does not meet the threshold to be Kenya's President."  Orengo said Raila cannot be charged with treason. In fact, he said, it is those in the government that should be charged with treason, because they "stole their way into State House". NASA has said it will swear in Raila as the people's President, but is yet to announce a date. The event was postponed from Jamhuri Day to the dismay of NASA supporters.
