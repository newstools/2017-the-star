Tanzanian singer Lady Jay Dee is no stranger to controversy. The no-nonsense singer is known to hit out at fans who pry into her personal life.  Askedwhen she will get a baby, she told a fan to stop poking her nose in her business, at the same time indicating she may not have a child anytime soon. She wrote, "Maswala yanahusikaje hapo kwa mfano. Mgneniacha nikapumua mtoto amekuwa mtoto kwani nisipopata itakuwaje kwa mfano? natakiwe nife au? na hii post inahusikaje na mtoto? jifunzeni kuwaachia watu maisha yao binafsi aisee mnnichosha. zaeni nyie mjaze dunia inatosha." Jay Dee just released a new single under Taurus Muszik titled Ya Nini.
