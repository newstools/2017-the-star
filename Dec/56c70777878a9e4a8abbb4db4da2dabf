An IEBC officer told a court that KIEMS kits used in the August 8 Yatta parliamentary election were reconfigured. Nicholas Karimi said the commission reconfigured the kits before the court granted an order for read-only access. He was testifying in a petition filed by Francis Mwangangi who is challenging the election of Charles Kilonzo. Mwangangi wants the court to find IEBC non-compliant to the order. But Karimi said the only data that can be found now is from form 35A. Karimi who was Yatta returning officer said the vote count cited in the petition differs from what was declared. He said Kilonzo won with 18,320 votes, while Mwangangi got 11,383. But Mwangangi cites figures of 17,888 and 11,580 respectively. The petition continues hearing on Thursday.
