Teachers have until December 31 to declare their wealth to the Teachers Service Commission in line with the Public Officer Ethics Act. The law requires every public officers to declare their income, assets and liabilities and those of his spouse (or spouses) and dependent children under the age of 18 once in every two years. The law was introduced to curb cases of corruption among public officers through misuse of public funds. The current period of declaration falls between November 1, 2015, and October 31. TSC has digitised the process since the enactment of the Act in 2003 and teachers can now fill the forms online at www.teachersonline.go.ke. The instruction manual on how to fill them can be found at www.tsc.go.ke.  “In this regard, all teachers are expected to fill an online declaration by December 31 following steps outlined in the wealth declaration instruction manual,” TSC executive officer Nancy Macharia said in a circular dated November 30. She said heads of institutions are required to monitor the declaration progress in their respective institutions and report non-compliance. “Any teacher in the TSC employment who fails to submit a declaration or gives false or misleading information is liable to a fine of Sh10,000 or imprisonment of a term not exceeding one year or both upon conviction,” Macharia said. She urged teachers to fill their forms on time to avoid slowing the system with bulk submission towards the deadline.
