Youths in Nyeri are demanding 40 senior positions in the county government. Led by Waruguru Kiai and Steve Nderi, they presented a memorandum to Governor Mutahi Kahiga on Monday urging him to appoint a youthful person as county executive for Youth, Sports and Social Services. They also demanded three Chief Officer posts out of the current five vacancies. According to the document, the youth leaders want 20 youths be recruited to serve as ward administrators and two as subcounty administrators. The group further want Kahiga to consider youths as heads of 30 per cent of the directorates in the devolved government. “The Government should ensure inclusivity of youths in the decision making process and ensure meaningful representation for youth in the running of the county government,” Nderi said. He added that they want the county government to facilitate establishment of a Youth Development Council in line with the Jubilee Party 2017 manifesto.

They also want establishment of an Affirmative Action Fund to ensure that special interest groups have access to county government resources. The Governor has also been asked to support agri-business and other value addition initiatives carried out by young people in the county. Youths have asked for internship programmes to mentor professionals amongst themselves. He said the presentation of the demands was occasioned by a great feeling that youth had been excluded and abandoned by the administration. There are 30 civic wards and eight sub-counties in the county. In October, there was some controversy after the county nominated a 65-year-old woman as executive in charge of youth.
