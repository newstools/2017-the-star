 A group of Ogiek in Nakuru county has criticised Nominated Senator Victor Prengei for blocking the vetting of chief officers.  He obtained a court order because no Ogiek was among the nominees. Elders and professionals from Kiptororo and Tinet in Kuresoi North and Kuresoi South subcounties said the senator should have consulted first. Simon Rotich led the professionals and Philip Koskei the elders. They spoke at a meeting in Kiptororo on Monday. “It was a blind move by the young man. Such moves may injure the reputation of the community, which had started reaping fruits from Jubilee through the nomination of a senator and two MCAs,” Mzee Koskei said. Rotich said the move would paint the community negatively. He said previous governments marginalised them. “Our community is finally being recognised, but Prengei is dragging us back,” he said. Rotich asked him to withdraw the case, apologise and seek advice. “ We don’t want to be punished because of an individual,” he said.  They said they support Governor Lee Kinyanjui.
