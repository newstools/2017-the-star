At least 1,000 youths in Kwale are set to benefit from an anti-radicalisation and counter-extremism programme by Haki Africa. Fransic Auma, the organisation's rapid response officer, noted many local youths have joined terror groups and gangs. Auma further noted the need to mobilise and empower them so they are not misused by politicians ."Youth, especially addicts, are mostly used by selfish politicians whenever there are protests. Empowering them give them a voice," he said. He addressed a peace campaign for youths, that Haki Africa organised on Monday.

We have met 1.000 youths in Mombasa," he said. "The project targets youths prone to gang life and extremism due to joblessness," he added.  Professor Hassan Mwakimako of Pwani University, who is a partner in the project, said Kwale needs the empowerment programme as it will contruibute to peace.
