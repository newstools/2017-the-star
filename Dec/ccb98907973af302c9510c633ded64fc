Traders have complained of harsh and ruthless treatment by county askaris. They said the brutality intensified immediately Governor Mike Sonko talked of plans to relocate them from the CBD in September. Sonko promised that harassment and inhumane treatment of hawkers by askaris would be a thing of the past. “I had a meeting with askaris and gave directive that no hawker should be harassed or treated inhumanely, but give warning to first-time offenders, and arrest second-time offenders. You will not be harassed when I am still the governor,” he said. Speaking to the Star on phone on Monday, Peter Mbaya, a senior inspector at City Hall, dismissed the allegations of askari brutality. “The askaris only follow the law by arresting the traders who continue to sell within the CBD, “ he said. Mbaya said some traders turn violent and throwstones at the askaris arresting them. He urged them to keep off the CBD to avoid trouble. Ronald Ngala and Tom Mboya streets are the most densely populated by traders. Sonko last month said the hawkers will be relocated to Mwariro Market in Kariokor.
