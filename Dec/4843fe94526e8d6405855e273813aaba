Two children died in a fire at their mother's makuti-thatched mud house in Kilifi county on Tuesday night. Moses
Chengo, nine, and four-year-old Babalo Chengo had been sleeping when the fire started, said their elder brother Khamis Chengo. “I was sleeping in my house when I heard my sisters, who were
sleeping outside, shouting my name. I dashed out to find the house
in which my brothers were sleeping on fire," he said. "We tried to put it out but
they had already died. We moved the bodies at around 11pm." The children's mother had reportedly gone out to drink palm wine when they died. The victims were the youngest of her eight children. Kitsao Tsofa, an uncle, said a lit lantern may have caused the fire. “They slept early but Moses woke up later and took supper before going back to bed. Moments later, the fire broke out. We suspect the lantern fell, setting fire to the mattress they were sleeping on," he said. "We do not suspect any foul play because it was the only house that caught fire." Tsofa said fire fighters arrived an hour later yet the station is about a kilometre away. Kilifi police boss Alexander Makau said they were investigating the cause of the fire. The bodies were taken to Kilifi county hospital
mortuary. Click here for the latest political stories
