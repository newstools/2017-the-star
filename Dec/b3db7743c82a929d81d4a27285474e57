Recount of votes in four Marakwet East polling stations will be carried out on Monday. This was after the High Court ordered a recount in a petition challenging MP Kangogo Bowen’s win. The High Court in Eldoret ordered the recount of votes in Cheptany Primary School, Mungwa Primary School, Mungwa Dispensary and Kumbulul Primary School polling stations. The order follows a petition filed by voter Sammy Kipkeu on September 6. Kipkeu had filed a motion in the Eldoret court for a scrutiny and recount of votes in all the 142 polling stations in October 9, but he was granted orders for the four polling stations. The voter had also sought an order to access to KIEMS kits used in the Marakwet East constituency elections, but judge Kanyi Kimondo disallowed the prayer. He argued that the scrutiny of all polling station will determine whether Bowen, who is the third respondent in the case won fairly in the August contest. Bowen was declared winner by the IEBC, which is the second respondent in the case, through returning officer Martin Wekesa who is the third respondent. He defeated former MP Linah Kilimo by 967 votes. The court further ordered the scrutiny of all forms 34A against forms 34B in 14 polling stations in the constituency. Some of the polling stations include Mkeno Primary, Kapchelag Wool Shade, Sambirir Primary school, Sambalat Primary School, Maron Primary School and nine other stations.
