Mathira MP Rigathi Gachagua yesterday dismissed the plan by NASA to sue Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet and Interior CS Fred Matiang’i over the killings of its supporters. He said it will fail. Gachagua said NASA leaders only intend to cause anxiety and tension in the country. “Their case will fail just like any other. They took President Uhuru Kenyatta to the ICC, then they took him to the Supreme Court twice. Let them know the presidential seat cannot be occupied by two people,” he said. Politics is behind every Kenyan and NASA must wait for 2022, Gachagua said in Ihwagi, Mathira. He was accompanied by Iria-ini MCA David Kabatha. Kabatha urged the courts to throw out any case filed by NASA so the country can move forward.  “NASA supporters also stoned police and burnt police cars. Let police do their work. They had to protect themselves against goons,” he said. Kabatha added it would be treasonable for NASA leader Raila Odinga to take the oath of office as President of Kenya.
