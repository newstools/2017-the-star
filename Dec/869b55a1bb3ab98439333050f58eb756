 Is Homa Bay Woman Rep Gladys Wanga positioning herself to become governor in 2022? During a fundraiser at Kanam Primary School at the weekend, guests sang her praises, saying she delivered during the elections. Wanga was appointed to head the Nyanza ODM campaigns for party leader Raila Odinga. Speakers said Nyar Wang’aya, as she is referred to locally, will run for governor. “We are behind you come 2022 for the Homa Bay governor seat,you are best suited to replace Awiti,” Rangwe MP Lilian Gogo said. But it will not be a smooth sailing for Wanga. Suba South MP John Mbadi, during the campaigns, announced he will go for nothing less but governor in 2022. Then there is former Kasipul MP Oyugi Magwanga, who has challenged the reelection of Governor Cyprian Awiti.
