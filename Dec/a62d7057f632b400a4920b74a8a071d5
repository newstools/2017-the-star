Michelle Yola has now hinted to her followers through a photo that she is going to deliver a baby girl who may just be as pretty as her. The socialite, formerly a jilted ex of rapper Prezzo, unveiled her baby bump in mid-2017. The screen beauty has been brimming and confident, going by her photos on social media. Yola posted a photo of a pink and grey-themed nursery and captioned it with a pink loveheart. I am really trying to guess the gender here. Is it a boy? Hmm? Yeah, pink is the colour used for boys. Hehehe! Just kidding! Pink has always been used to announce the female gender during gender reveals. The mum-to-be has disclosed to observers that the baby daddy of the child is white, although we have still not seen his face.
