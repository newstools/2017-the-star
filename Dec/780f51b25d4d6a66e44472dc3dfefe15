The Embu county government has set aside a Sh25 million kitty for youths who want to start or expand businesses. Youth Empowerment and Sports executive John Ngari (pictured) on Thursday said the money would be loaned to interested individuals or groups. He said job opportunities are scarce and urged young people to take advantage of the cash to transform their lives. Application forms will be made available at the ward administrators’ offices from next Friday. Ngari spoke at Canan Guest House in Embu town. He met eight beneficiaries of Equity Bank’s Wings to Fly high school scholarship. He said not every applicant will get the cash. Applicants must attach business proposals, which officers will verify to determine if they should be approved. Ngari said applicants should have a business management or entrepreneurship-training certificate. “The money should have been given to individuals or groups by January 31 next year, so they start businesses,” he said. The county also plans to launch a football tournament. Teams will participate from the  sublocation level to the county level, leading to the formation of a county team, which is expected to take part in a national league. Ngari said each ward will get Sh2 million for bursaries, especially for students in vocational training colleges, boarding schools and universities. He told students or their parents to apply. Application forms will be posted on the county website and copies provided at the ward administrators’ offices.
