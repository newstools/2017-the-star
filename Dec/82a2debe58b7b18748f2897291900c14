National Under-20 women’s football team striker Cynthia Shilwatso will undergo three-month trials with Swedish top side Hammarby next month. The striker, was part of the Vihiga Queens team, which recently won the 2017 Kenya women’s Premier League title with a well deserved 2-1 win against Thika Queens. Shilwatso star seems to be on a rise having been part of the team, which had a fair run during the U-20 women’s World Cup qualifier. The 18-year-old who recently sat for her secondary school examination at Ibinzo before joining Vihiga, was part of the team that registered wins against Botswana and Ethiopia en-route stumbling on the last hurdle against Ghana in the early stages of qualifiers. Vihiga coach Alex Alumira confirmed the player will undergo trials and wished her well as she commences preparations. Alumira said with the development, it’s now clear the national league is growing and will be better in near future. “For now, I am extremely happy that one of my player has caught the eyes of a foreign club. However, there not much I can say now but to wish her success at the trials,” said Alumira. He added: “Shilwatso is a utility player and if you were keen during the finals against Thika, I played her as a defender and she rose up to the occasion. At the same time, she uses both of her feet and that’s a plus and I wouldn’t be surprised if the trials are successful.” At the same time, another Kenyan player Lilly Awour has also gotten a nod to undergo trials at the same club in January. Awour, a former Spedag player, moved to Kigoma Sisters last season as her side finished fourth at the end of the season. Should the two be successful, they will join a growling list of African players who have joined the Swedish sides including Malawian playmaker Temwa Chawinga and Sabinah Thom. The Swedish league is expected to kick off in April.
