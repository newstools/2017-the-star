The government will open day wings in boarding schools on a trial basis starting next year. This is in a bid to achieve 100 per cent transition from primary to secondary school. The move aims to maximise the use of available resources as well as delink the admission of form one’s to institutions on the basis of the school bed capacity. The trial will begin in Nairobi because of its cosmopolitan nature and will involve extra-county and county schools. Following the introduction of free day secondary education, day scholars will not be required to pay any extra money. The government has completed placement of students to national schools and the process will go on in subsequent categories before official closure on December 12. During this year’s selection, national schools will admit only 2.8 per cent ( 29,411 ) of the total candidates who sat for there KCPE examination, 11 per cent ( 123,399 ) to extra-county schools, 13 per cent ( 142,358 ) to county schools while subcounty schools will carry the bulk of those admitted with approximately 63 per cent ( 647,800 ) of the total admissions. Admission is expected to start by January 9 and end no later than January 12. Among those who have been placed include top candidates Goldalyn Kakuya whose letter indicates she will proceed to Kenya High School and Sharon Nkatha who will proceed to Alliance Girls High School. Speaking in Nairobi during the launch of the form one selection and placement exercise, Education CS Fred Matiang’i said this year’s selection will not be different from last year’s, adding all students will get a place. “Upon placement the parents can download the admission forms and print them,” he said. Students will receive six textbooks from the government upon admission.
