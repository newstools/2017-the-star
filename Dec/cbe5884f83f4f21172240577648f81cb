Who has the right to make decisions on circumcision in the family? In some cultures, this rite of passage is a cause for celebration and is led by clan elders. However a family in Mombasa is involved in a tussle over who has the right to make a decision on when and where their son should be circumcised. An eight-year-old boy was circumcised without his mother’s knowledge.

She said her sister-in-law took it into her own hands to have her son circumcised. The mother, who is from Ruiru, said her children travelled to Mombasa immediately after schools closed to visit their aunt. Last Friday, her 16-year-old firstborn called and told her plans were underway to circumcise the boy. She called her sister-in-law, who said everything was set for the ritual. “I told my sister-in-law to wait till I arrived in Mombasa. I wanted to counsel my son and prepare him psychologically. I was not against the process,” she said. She took a bus to Mombasa, but when she got there her son had already been circumcised. “I tried to call my sister-in-law but she was not [answering her calls]. My daughter later told me the boy had been circumcised and that was why the aunt was not taking my calls,” she said. She reported the matter to Likoni police station and the sister-in-law was arrested and briefly detained.  She was released under unclear circumstances. The woman said her Muslim husband is not speaking to her. “What were her motives for circumcising my son in my absence, yet I had informed her that I wanted to be present?” The sister-in-law did not answer calls for comment.
