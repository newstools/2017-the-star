Machakos Governor Alfred Mutual has announced he will vie for the presidency in 2022. The Maendeleo Chap Chap defeated Wiper candidate Wavinya Ndeti to retain his seat but the win is being challenged in court. Mutua said aged leaders should leave the political stage, an apparent attack on Opposition leader Raila Odinga who has dominated the political scene for more than five decades.

"I'm planning to shock Kenya in the next few years," he said on Wednesday during the 13th annual primary school heads meet in Mombasa. "I will show you what I'm capable of doing." Mutua's steady rise, especially after the formation of MCC party, threatened Kalonzo Musyoka's grip in Ukambani region, pundits said. This was based on the fact that Wiper, Kalonzo's party, performed dismally in 2017 polls. Raila vied for State House with Kalonzo as his running mate but the two withdrew from the repeat citing lack of reforms. They also claimed the result had been pre-determined. This gave President Uhuru Kenyatta an easy win with 98 per cent of total votes cast by 38.84 per cent of registered voters.
