Four Kenyans who were jailed in South Sudan have landed at JKIA after weeks of bilateral talks between the two governments. Anthony Keya, Boniface Muriuki, Ravi Ghaghda and Anthony Mwadime arrived minutes before 7pm on Wednesday evening. They were received by Foreign Affairs PS Monica Juma and Jasper Mbiuki who works in the Presidency. They were arrested on May 29, 2015, alongside 12 others - mostly South Sudanese nationals - and jailed for suspected fraud for allegedly stealing Sh1.4 billion ($14 million) from President Salva Kiir’s office. The suspects were held for more than 40 days without being interrogated.
