There will be 100 per
cent transition of students from primary to secondary schools by 2021, Education
PS Belio Kipsang said yesterday. The Teachers Service Commission has said this will only be achieved if 12,696
teachers are recruited yearly for the next five years. 
 Kipsang
said the government is investing in Technical Industrial Vocational
and Entrepreneurship Training institutions and universities to avail
adequate opportunity. “We
shall continue to make the commitment that all of our children who
leave standard eight get slots in secondary school,” he said. He
spoke in Mombasa during the 13th primary school head teachers meeting. TSC
chief executive Nancy Macharia said more emphasis in staffing of secondary
schools, especially the day schools, is key in achieving the four-year target.
 She said they have made proposal to have 63,480 new teachers by 2022. “The
TSC will also review staffing norms to be able to adequately respond
to the staffing needs of the envisaged competence-based curriculum,”
she said. Macharia
said there will be staff rationalisation and teachers posted in needy
schools.  “We
will, however, continue posting teachers to areas with shortages,”
she said.
