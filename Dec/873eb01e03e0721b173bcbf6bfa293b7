Divers and experts whose equipment was used in the Lake Nakuru recovery exercise have accused the county government of failing to support them. Lake Naivasha boat owners association chair David Kilo said they were forced to make their own transport plans. He said they were cash-strapped and hoped the county government would chip in. "During the recovery exercise, we provided those involved with four
boats to be used in the operation but ferrying them back is now turning
out to be a challenge," he said on Tuesday. He said despite several requests to the county government, they are yet to receive a response. But a senior county official who declined to be named said there was confusion in funding because of the many parties involved. "We had the Sonko rescue team, the navy and the Naivasha team and even locals. It was a challenge dealing with all the parties," the officer added.

The government has in the past banned night fishing in the lake in a bid to reduce boat accidents and drowning. Kilo thanked KMA and said they will ensure fishermen always make use of the jackets. "Coxswains have also been trained on issues to do with safety and we remind all fishermen on the importance of wearing safety jackets while fishing," he said. Click here for the latest political news
