Property worth Sh6 million was destroyed during demolitions by Kisumu county officials on Saturday morning. Traders and residents in Dunga area said the officials brought down around 24 stalls and dozens of homes. Informal traders chair Joanese Odera said they were not given any notice of the demolition. "We didn't know about this. Two weeks ago we woke up and found some red line on the shops. When we questioned why the shops were marked, we did not get an answer, only to find this [destruction] in the morning," he told journalists. Odera said they intend to take legal action against the Trade CEC if he fails to respond to the matter by Monday.
