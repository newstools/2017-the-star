Nyando MP Jared Okelo has threatened to resign in two weeks if NASA leader Raila Odinga is not sworn-in as the country's president.  Speaking in Nyakach during the burial of veteran radio journalist Agao Patrobas, Okelo stunned mourners when announced his resignation plans.  "I went into Parliament not to sit in the Opposition benches but to support President Raila Odinga's policies as he discharges his mandate from state house. I had scanned the environment , followed the polls and was confident of a Raila win," he said on Monday.  "I can't sit pretty in parliament with people I know connived to snatch Odinga's victory while he languishes out in the cold," he added. The first time MP who has served his constituents for less than four months he cannot continue being Nyando MP with Uhuru Kenyatta as the president.  He demanded that the NASA leader take oath of office before the year ends, failure to which he will call it quits at the National Assembly.  "This perennial electoral theft must come to an end for the country to move forward. Delivering electoral justice is the panacea to the ills bedeveling Kenya as a nation. Stealing elections three terms in a row is unacceptable." The burial was attended by among others Kisumu Senator Fred Outa, area MP Aduma Owuor and a host of other leaders.  NASA has said it will swear in the coalition leader next month. Attorney General Githu Muigai has termed the move high treason, adding that it attracts the death sentence. Last week, the Supreme Court ruled that the mandatory death sentence in Section 204 of the penal code is unconstitutional.  The section says that the punishment for capital offences, including treason, murder and robbery with violence is death. But the court said judges can use discretion when making rulings.
