Former Funyula MP Paul Otuoma suffered a setback on Thursday when the video evidence he had annexed to his affidavit implicating Governor Sospeter Ojaamong was expunged from court records. Affidavits of 43 witnesses that petitioner Peter Odima had listed but were not called to testify, were also expunged. Ojaamong through his lawyer, Otiende Amolo had urged Judge Kiarie Waweru Kiarie to expunge the names of witnesses who had not testified and Otuoma’s video annexed to the affidavit. David Ochieng, Odium’s lawyer, urged the court to defer the ruling until the third respondent testifies. Amolo praised the ruling saying they will now reduce their witnesses from the initial 21 to six or seven. Amolo asked the court to adjourn the hearing to January 8 told to enable him reorganise his witnesses.
