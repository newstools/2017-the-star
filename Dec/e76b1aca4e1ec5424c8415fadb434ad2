Young people have started engaging themselves in Forex trading to earn money. Evans Karanja, one of the Forex trader, yesterday said smartphones, laptops and iPads have helped the youth to follow the local and international market trading. Karanja, who was recently hired by The Royal Institute of Business at Kiambaa, Kabete constituency, said he makes at least Sh2,000 everyday from the trade. “I'm hired by the institution, which was opened recently to train people to participate in Forex trading,” he said. Institute chairman Charles Njuguna said they are regulated to train trading by the Capital Markets Authority. Njuguna praised the CMA for allowing brokerage firms to train Forex trading, saying a lot of people will join the markets. Njuguna also a Forex trader, said they have developed a new curriculum on Forex trading, which is being reviewed by the Education ministry. "The Curriculum Development Authority is reviewing our new curriculum. We are hoping for the best as people are training and trading,” he said. He was accompanied by institution's principal Richard Mutinda. Karanja urged the youth to join the trading. “I normally spend the day training and I trade at night. The Asian markets happens at night here in the country, since those counties are normally during the day, we are ahead of them with time,” he said. Click here for the latest political news
