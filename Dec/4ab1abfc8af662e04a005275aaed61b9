The NCPB still owes farmers more than Sh1.5 billion, having bought more than 1.4 million bags of maize so far. Hundreds of farmers in the North Rift still queue with lorries outside the NCPB depots to deliver more maize to the board. A 90kg bag goes for Sh3,200. The board has so far paid farmers Sh1.6 billion. Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Willy Bett has said the board will be given more money to clear outstanding payments. “We gave out Sh1 billion a week ago and we still have enough cash to buy all the maize from farmers,” he told the Star on the phone on Wednesday. “We will give the NCPB more money as pledged by the government.”  Bett said the NCPB will be funded adequately to buy at least two million bags by year’s end. Last week, he visited the NCPB depot in Eldoret to inspect the ongoing purchase. Since then, officials have adopted a quick clearing method to ensure farmers do not overstay in the queues. “We are happy that farmers don’t have to line up for long. But we urge that they be paid as fast as possible,” Kenya Farmers’ Association director Kipkorir Menjo said.
