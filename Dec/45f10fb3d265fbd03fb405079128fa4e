The Kenya Defence Force has dropped nine positions in this year’s Global Firepower rankings which compares global military powers. Kenya ranked 77 out of 133 countries considered for the annual GFP review from position 68 last year in fresh military rankings released on Wednesday. The KDF has been dropping since 2013, when it was ranked 46 among the word’s most powerful militaries. Egypt was the only African country in the top 10 this year. Kenya ranked lower than Sudan, Libya, Nigeria, Algeria, South Africa, Angola, Morocco and Ethiopia but beat its neighbours Uganda and Tanzania. The GFP measures military power based on actual manpower that drives a particular military. Equipment and perceived fighting strength are also considered. Wars of attrition are favourably considered for more manpower. GFP measures army strength through battle tanks. It also considers a country’s military tank destroyers, armoured fighting vehicles including personnel carriers and infantry fighting vehicles. Traditional aircraft carriers, warships submarines assets - both diesel, electric and nuclear-powered, and all naval assets are also considered. In Air-power, the GFP examines fixed and rotary wing helicopter aircrafts from all the three branches of the service. Read:Uhuru makes changes to Kenya Defence Forces
