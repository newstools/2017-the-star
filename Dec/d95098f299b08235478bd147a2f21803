Anti-graft detectives on Friday impounded a Land Cruiser said to be one of 27 vehicles purchased by Garissa county for Sh186 million in 2015. Documents obtained by the EACC indicate the Land Cruiser worth more than Sh9 million has not been collected from the Kencot Container Freight Station near Mbaraki in Mombasa. A firm identified as Alama Trading Company Ltd, which is based in Nairobi and owned by Ibrahim Kontoma, was awarded the tender to supply 27 vehicles, including Pajeros and Prados from Dubai. The company imported 27 vehicles, including 4x4 Terrains, pickups and saloon cars, but the Land Cruiser was never delivered to the county. The circumstances were not clear. The EACC said the former Garissa county administration inflated the cost and ended up paying Sh246 million — far above the Sh186 million for procurement of the 27 vehicles. EACC spokesman Yasin Amaro told the press the detectives are investigating several senior officials in Procurement department. He said the commission has written to the CFS, demanding the Land Cruiser be impounded until investigations are completed. The clearing agent had already paid Sh1 million for clearance of the vehicle in January 2015, but it has remained at the warehouse since April 2015. “Investigation are ongoing. We are looking into circumstances under which the vehicle continues to be held at the warehouse, with all the money paid for the delivery,”Amaro said. The commission also wants to establish why two companies, which were not contracted, were paid for the supply of the vehicles. They are Nairobi’s Ocean Atlantic company and Mombasa’s Galaxy Logistics Ltd, the EACC said. In July 2017, former Garissa Governor Nathif Juma dismissed claims he pocketed Sh5.2 billion from the county government. He said former EACC chief executive Halakhe Waqo was being used by his opponents to frame him.
