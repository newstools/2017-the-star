Some 900 people have been charged in connection with corruption since EACC chairman Eliud Wabukala took office in January. “As at November 30, 2017, we had 423 cases pending in court,” he said. Plans are on course to step up prosecution and sensitisation on the dangers of graft. Thirty-three cases have been finalised and the commission is processing more files for action in the coming weeks. “Within the same period we had 25 convictions, three acquittals and six discharges. All this is an indication that we are making very good progress in the battle to eliminate graft,” Wabukala said. He spoke during a training session in Eldoret town. The EACC has preserved assets worth Sh374 million that had been lost through corruption. And recovered Sh134 million in cash in one year. The commission has also averted the possible loss of Sh1.6 billion. The EACC is handling graft cases in 26 counties, with 10 already before the courts. “So far, three constitutional petitions have been filed at the High Court of Nairobi, Constitutional and Human Rights Division against state officers for alleged ethical breaches of the provisions of the Leadership and Integrity Act 2012,” he said.
