Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati has asked Kenyans to desist from divisive politics and put the country first. Speaking at yesterday’s Jamhuri Day celebrations at Pan Paper Stadium, Webuye, he said the country is grappling with a myriad challenges such as disease, poverty and illetracy which have not been eradicated since Independence in 1963. “It is half a century but the twin cancers of corruption and tribalism have conspired to make the situation worse. Most of our people are dying of common and easy-to-treat diseases,” Wangamati said during the Jamhuri Day fete . Other NASA leaders in Bungoma boycotted the fete on grounds Kenyans have nothing to celebrate. Wangamati said his administration will create more jobs and he has set up a taskforce to spearhead the revival of the dairy sector and other collapsed industries in the county. “I have allocated Sh70 million for setting up a milk-processing plant and to support artificial insemination ,” he said.
