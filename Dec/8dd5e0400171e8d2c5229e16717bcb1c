The Migori assembly has unanimously approved nine of the 10 county executives nominated by Governor Okoth Obado. Speaker Boaz Okoth said the decision was made after the appointments committee vetted all candidates. They left out Sheila Ghati, from Kuria West, who held the Public Administration docket. “Members passed the list which cuts across all eight sub-counties. The candidates were qualified,” Okoth told journalists on Thursday. Regarding Ghati, he said: “There were technical issues regarding her position which was re-advertised again, days to the vetting process. We left her out as employment is a competitive process. We are waiting for a new list from the Governor." The nine people will be sworn-in should they agree to take the jobs. They include Kephas Nyamita (Environment and Disaster), Isca Oluoch (Health), Rebecca Ghati (Water and Energy) and  Samson Maginga (Education and Culture). The others are Moses Chamwada (Public Works and Roads), Scholarstica Atieno (Finance), Valentine Ogongo who vied for Suna West MP (Agriculture), Elizabeth Ochaye (Trade) and Elijah Odhaimbo (Lands). Obado retained six of the 10 executives who served in his first term. Three, who vied for office on August 8 but did not win, are Michael Ogutu (Suna West MP), Thomas Maneno (Kuria East MP) and Tom Kasera (Kachieng’ ward). Click here for the latest political stories
