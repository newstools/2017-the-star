Compensating victims of wildlife attacks has become a nightmare for the Environment ministry because of loopholes in the Wildlife Management and Conservation Act. Environment CS Judi Wakhungu (pictured) on Thursday said amendments are long overdue. She made the remarks at the Kenya Wildlife Service headquarters during the launch of a report titled, ‘State of Wildlife Conservation in Kenya 2016.’ “We want to remove snakebites because nowdays, anybody can be bitten, even in their compounds,” Wakhungu said. She said claims, especially from snake bites, have been pending. Compensation claims have hit Sh1.5 billion. The CS said the highest number of claims is for snakebites. The ministry has been allocated only Sh250 million since 2015 for compensation. “I have ever only received Sh250 million from Treasury for compensation for lives lost -Sh5 million for each case,” Wakhungu said. She said the ministry first compensated families that lost loved ones first. “We need to amend the law because of the realities. We do not want to give communities the false impression that they are going to be paid,” Wakhungu said. Director of wildlife conservation, Stephen Manengene, said between 2014-2016, 62 per cent of claims were for snakebites while 38 per cent were for loss of crops and property.      Manengene said 274 cases were each awarded Sh5 million.
