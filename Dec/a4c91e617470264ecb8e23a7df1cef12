Football fans from Nairobi who wish to attend the CECAFA Senior Challenge Cup finals at Kenyatta stadium in Machakos on Sunday will be given free transport courtesy of Governor Mike Sonko. The city boss tweeted that those interested in the free ride for the 3pm encounter between Kenya and Zanzibar should present themselves at the Shell petrol station pick-up point adjacent to Nyayo Stadium on Mombasa road. “Free transport to and from Machakos. If you want to go cheer our national soccer team "THE HARAMBEE STARS" as they play ZANZIBAR in the CECAFA finals, be at Shell petrol station, Nyayo Stadium, at 1 PM,” read the tweet.

In October 2010, he facilitated over 200 fans to Uganda during Harambee Star’s Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against hosts Uganda Cranes. Sonko also sponsored over 100 Gor Mahia fans to watch the Sportpesa Cup pre-season match between English premier league side Everton and Kogallo in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania in July this year. The governor has also promised Stars Sh2 million if they win Sunday’s clash. Kenya beat Sudan 2-0 in the finals at Nyayo stadium to win the title in 2013 under head coach Adel Amrouche. The Stars beat a resilient Burundi 1-0 in the semis on Thursday at Kisumu’s Moi Stadium to book the ticket against Zanzibar.  Zanzibar qualified after edging out defending champions Uganda Cranes 2-1 at the same venue on Friday.  Click here for the latest political news
