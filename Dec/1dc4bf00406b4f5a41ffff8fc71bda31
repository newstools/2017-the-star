Tunji is blowing up at an incredible rate — faster than it took some of the top rappers in the country. He made quite an entrance. For a better part of the year, he has managed to stay relevant with straight-up bangers.  Well, he managed to give us one of the biggest hits in 2017, “Mat za Ronga,” which is in appreciation of Kenya’s matatu culture, especially those that ply the Nairobi-Rongai route. And indeed, this jam was a big tune, to the extent that it got Khaligraph to jump on the remix and keep the anthem going.  Being perhaps the first extended exposure to an artist previously heard in brief fits, his flow is impressively consistent, a sign that he has mastered it and is likely to dominate on our airwaves. He offers the jumpy energy that has been key with other rappers like Boutross and Barak Jacuzzi. The Western sound is ostensibly the model for Tunji’s kind of rapping, but somehow capitalising on the momentum, he has managed to keep it authentic in his own unique way. To prove the veracity of this statement, he offers quite a rare flow on MDQ’s reworked “Kenyan Message”.  In truth, the Kenyan hip-hop scene is one of the genres releasing shareable artistes, and it is young rappers like Tunji who are reinventing the genre. They are jumping into the scene with so much creative enthusiasm and releasing tracks that rattle listener’s heads for hours. However, only time will tell if Tunji’s zeal goes beyond simple things like volume and excitement. He is fortunate to be dining with some of the big names and needs to run with it. Considering his works, he has had a good start, but there aren’t enough of these moments to even rank him. Anyway, we can’t wait to see what he has in store for us.
