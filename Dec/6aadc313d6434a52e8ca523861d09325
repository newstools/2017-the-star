 Business in the Senate yesterday came to a standstill when Majority leader Kipchumba Murkomen and his Minority counterpart Moses Wetang’ula engaged in a bitter exchange. The two top House leaders took on each other for at least 10 minutes following Murkomen’s move to ignore the opposition side in contributing to a motion extending the House sittings for one week. Murkomen moved the motion during the afternoon session presided over by Speaker Kenneth Lusaka, but deviated from the House tradition requiring Minority leader or if absent, a member of the opposition, to second it.

Khaniri argued Senator Murkomen (Elgeyo Marakwet) was breaking the House rules by ignoring the contribution of NASA members led by Wetang’ula. The motion sought to extend the sittings to December 15 from tomorrow before the House proceeds for the long recess. Senators extended the time to ensure Kenya’s representation to the East African Legislative Assembly is dispensed before going on recess until next year on February 13. Wetang’ula took to the floor following Khaniri’s protest and accused Murkomen of turning important House matters requiring bipartisan approach into a Jubilee affair. Murkomen defended his decision by accusing Wetang’ula of missing the House Business Committee meeting on Tuesday that resolved to introduce the motion. Click here for the latest political stories
