The Homa Bay High Court has ordered a recount and scrutiny of votes for the governor race. Justice Joseph Karanja on Monday dismissed an application by Governor Cyprian Awiti compelling the court not to order a recount. The court granted an order to scrutinise and audit of results on forms 37A, B and C, as well as KIEMS kits used by the electoral agency. Already, a number of ballot boxes have been preserved and sealed as directed by Karanja at the start of proceedings. Former Kasipul MP Oyugi Magwanga filed a petition challenging Awiti's victory on August 8. County returning officer Michael Kosgei and the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission have also been sued. Through lawyer Charles Kanjama, Magwanga said he won the election with 223,311 votes, while Awiti got 179,551 votes. He wants the Governor's win nullified and to be declared winner in the election. The court will give direction on Thursday on how the scrutiny will be conducted. Click
