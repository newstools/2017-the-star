Trans Nzoia leaders have differed on the ejection of Water CS Eugene Wamalwa from the Maragoli Cultural Festival on Tuesday. Former Saboti MP David Wafula yesterday blamed NASA principal Musalia Mudavadi for failing to stop the rowdy youths from humuliating the CS. Wafula was among those who accompanied Wamalwa to the function. “Musalia failed to recognise the CS even after we arrived. Instead, he went to him and told him the ground was hostile. He should have used his popularity to cool down the rowdy youths,” he told the Star on the phone. But other leaders defended Mudavadi, saying he saved Wamalwa by escorting him to his car. Trans Nzoia Kuppet secretary Furaha Lusweti and politician Immaculate Shamala said the incident showed the Luhya community is tired with Jubilee.
