Laura Oyier grabbed the headlines back in 2015 after she spent her Valentines at InterContinental hotel, Nairobi, and failed to pay the bill, which accumulated to Sh230,000. The mellow-voiced singer was arrested and charged before she got help in settling her bill. Laura Oyier has been lying low like an envelope for quite a while, and it seems she’s away and been busy. “I’ve been living in  Beijing, China, and for this reason, I've been off social media. As you might know these platforms are banned by the Chinese government. So it’s unfortunate I've not been able to post anything out of my shows,” she exclusively told Word is. Laura says she jetted back into the country a few days ago for the holidays, and she will be leaving soon. Known for her signature eyebrows, Laura Oyier said she learnt her lesson the hard way after she was stood up on Valentine's holiday. "I don’t even think about that anymore, but it affected my brand. Handed lemons, some people make lemonade. Laura Oyier makes champagne," she laughed. Adding: "I learnt that when wolves come for you, tell them ‘bring it’. With focus, you will be a success. Never fear." Laura revealed that she is dating and has decided to settle down. "I am seeing someone, someone wonderful, but that’s all I can say about our relationship." The controversial woman started her own branded water business back in 2015. “The water business is going on. We sell them exclusively at the various show venues every time I perform,” she said. Laura Oyier went ahead to advise women interested in blind dates. “I generally don’t do blind dates but with all things, one must be careful for sure. Maybe go on a blind date that’s recommended by people you trust, you know, mutual friends. That way your date isn’t totally anonymous if you must go.”
