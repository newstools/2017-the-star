A 25 year old woman in Eldoret GK prison — who was arrested for murder but has not yet charged — won Miss Eldoret. Victoria Letting beat 15 other contestants to emerge the best in the annual event at the correctional facility. Clad in a long Kitenge and a bracelet and long heels, Letting convinced the event organisers to clinch this year’s title. ''I did not expect to win. It has came as a surprise. I give God the glory because everyone participating in the context was equally up to the task,'' Letting said. Rahab Njoki was first runners up followed by Christine Achoyo, who bagged the third position. They were given cash prizes and gift hampers. Letting told Word Is she will use her win to encourage others, saying "being in prison is not the end of life, and I know God has a reason for everything." She admitted society still stigmatises women who have been in jail, adding that most of them fear for their life after they complete their jail term. Vera College has partnered with the Eldoret Prison to nurture talent. Letting said the key things the judges were looking for were catwalking,ability to speak in public and creativity. Officer in charge of the women prison Beatrice Were said Letting is disciplined, humble and a cheerful lady, who interacts with others easily.
