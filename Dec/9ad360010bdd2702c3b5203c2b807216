South Africa's ruling African National Congress (ANC) has selected Cyril Ramaphosa to succeed President Jacob Zuma as the party's leader. The country's deputy president defeated former cabinet minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, Zuma's ex-wife, after a marathon voting process. Ramaphosa is in a strong position to become president in 2019 polls. The leadership battle caused fierce political infighting, raising fears the party may split before the election. Ramaphosa defeated Dlamini-Zuma by 2,440 votes to 2,261, an ANC spokesperson announced. The result triggered celebrations among party members. Media reports earlier said the announcement had been delayed after Dlamini-Zuma's camp had demanded a recount. Ramaphosa, 65, has spoken out strongly against state corruption and has the backing of the business community. Dlamini-Zuma, 68, had been critical of the enduring power of white-owned businesses and had pledged to tackle what she said was continued racial inequality.
