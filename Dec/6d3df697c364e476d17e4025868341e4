The National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) has mapped sections of roads where accidents are likely to occur. The areas mapped out are on the Nairobi-Nyeri-Isioli, Nairobi-Embu-Meru, Nairobi-Mombasa, Nairobi-Malaba, Nairobi-Narok-Kisii-Migori and Nairobi-Naivasha-Gilgil-Nyahururu roads. The assistant deputy director of road safety Harold Aden on Saturday said that they will patrol these sections everyday and arrest those found drunk driving or those caring excess passengers. "We have partnered with the police and mapped out major roads across the country. We are not here to inconvenience passengers but take care of them on the road, Aden said.
