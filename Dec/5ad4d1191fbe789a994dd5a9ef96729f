Homeboyz winger Brian Wandera has been ruled out of action for the next three months. Wandera underwent surgery last week on a hernia injury he sustained against KCB in the Impala floodlit tournament last month, ruling him out of action until March. Wandera joined the deejays from Quins during the October transfer window. Head coach, Paul Murunga expects the dependable player to make a full recovery within the set time frame.  “The league has taken a break but by the time we enter March, the league will be in full swing and we hope Wandera will have recovered well to play a part in the playoffs,” said Murunga. Murunga was delighted with the start the deejays have had in their four matches so far with wins over Quins (41-29), Impala (39-21), Kisii (27-21) and Nondies (29-21) to lie second on the standings with 18 points, two behind champions KCB. “We have had a good start but we know it’s a long season and we must pace ourselves well to be in contention by the time we get to the playoffs and finals later in the season,” said Murunga. The deejays came unstuck in the semifinals last year, losing to Kabras 22-17 in sudden death at a rain-drenched Jamhuri Park grounds. “We want to go all the way this time round. The players learnt their lessons from the semis last year and can only get better,” added Murunga Elsewhere, Samson Onsomu has been appointed the new Impala Saracens overall captain. Onsomu, 25, takes over from Duncan Ekasi for the club’s captaincy as per the statement sent to the newsroom by Impala Saracens. “Samson Onsomu has taken over from Duncan Ekasi in the overall club captaincy role at Resolution Impala Saracens,” read the statement. Ekasi, who has limiting commitments a work and school, remained confident of Onsomu’s leadership. “He is a club-man. He has the club at heart. Onsomu’s captaincy begins at a time when he has a great team of players to lead. He has gathered enough experience to lead and I believe he is the right man for the job.”
