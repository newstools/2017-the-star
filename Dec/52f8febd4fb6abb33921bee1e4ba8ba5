JKUAT on Saturday announced that it will resume academic activities effective Monday, December 4. In a memo, registrar Esther Muoria asked the students to report back to campus by Sunday in preparation for classes. "Students must clear all outstanding fees and sign nominal roll by December 8," Muoria said. On November 15, JKUAT suspended studies indefinitely over the lecturers strike caused by an unresolved Sh10 billion pay row.  The dons are pushing for higher perks as contained in the 2013-17 CBA drafted by universities, unions and the government. Lecturers said lack of accountability on the part of the government is the cause of their strikes.
