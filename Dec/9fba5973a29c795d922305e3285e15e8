Celebrated Radio Jambo presenter Daniel Githinji, popularly known as Mbusii, was among the 59 exemplary Kenyans who benefited from the Head of State Commendation award on Mashujaa Day. Speaking to Radio Jambo, the soft-spoken drive presenter was ecstatic and dedicated the recognition to God for a successful year, which also saw him and his colleague Lion-deh being hosted by President Uhuru Kenyatta for an exclusive one-on-one interview at State House Nairobi. “Kwanza nafeel nikiwa Irie kwa mawingu ya juu kabisa!” Mbusii said. I didn’t expect the special recognition because I did not have any idea there was such a list. Funny thing, I actually never made an appearance either at Kasarani Stadium or State House.” On what he thinks was the reason Uhuru honoured him, he said: "It’s because I have never changed ever since I started off. I am still humble and more so, I deal with youths from humble beginnings. "The youths know that I advocate for their rights and speak on their behalf, and when the President noticed that, he honoured me as the youth ambassador." Mbusii said the special award will open new ventures for him, even as he looks to work more with corporates in the coming year. "There are corporate gigs that I wasn’t lucky enough to secure, and maybe this special recognition will just but open doors. 2017 I would say since I started out as a presenter has been my best year yet. "Ku meet Orezo wa Kenya sio kitu ya mchezo. Watu wengi sana wanatamani lakini kumfikia huwa ngumu. So hii mwaka favour ya Sir Jah imekuwa excess kwangu, na nahope 2018 hiyo ndio itakuwa sasa ya kuomoka ile viserious!"
