A Swiss offshore company wants the court in Malindi to summon an MP, his law firm and an investor in a Sh1 billion property dispute.  This concerns the multi-billion-shilling 16-acre luxury Kilifi Black Marlin Resort at the centre of an ownership dispute.  The Swiss company says ex-parte orders issued on November 23 this year at the Malindi Environment and Land Court were based on forged documents.  The court issued interim orders in favour of investor Bhavasar Anadkumar, trading as Sarax Enterprises, to evict Beloilco Holdings Ltd from the suit property. Anadkumar had told the court he bought the land through public auction on September 26 last year for Sh200 million. Beloilco Holdings lawyer Kinyua Kamunde on Monday told the court that lawyers representing Sarax engaged in misconduct and could have compromised court officials. He urged the court to report lawyer and Narok North MP Moitalel ole Kenta and lawyers Koceyo O Titus, Timothy Ilako and Joseph Mwanthi to the DCI and to the Disciplinary Committee for investigations and punishment for misconduct andoffences committed in relation to the petition.
