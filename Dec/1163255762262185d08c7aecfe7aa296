Media personality Adelle Onyango is among the chosen few who will be
part of the panel at the CGMS 2017, curated by the BBC, taking place in
London. The ‘Thriving Online’ session will explore how young people can strike a balance between freedom and well-being online. The Duke
and Duchess of Cambridge will be meeting a number of handpicked
delegates in an official receiving line as they arrive, and Adelle
Onyango is among the chosen few. This meeting will take place tomorrow. This news excited Adelle, who took to Instagram to express her joy with the caption, “The smile you get when you find out you’re one of the
delegates who will be receiving Prince William and Kate Middleton - Duke
and Duchess of Cambridge — at the Children’s Global Media Summit this
week!”
