The Kericho County Level 4 Hospital is set to begin pacemaker implantation procedures. Governor Paul Chepkwony visited the US and struck a deal with cardiologists from Michigan State University to establish a regional pacemaker implantation centre in Kericho to serve patients with heart problems.   In a statement yesterday, he said the first such procedure could take place in mid-February. Until now, most Kenyans in need of pacemaker implantation are forced to travel to India, which is usually very costly. Chepkwony is expected back in the country today. He said he managed to secure several deals for Kericho, especially in the health sector.  The governor said his administration wants to transform the county into a health tourism hub. This was his first overseas trip since his reelection. Â
