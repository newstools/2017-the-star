 A Thika court has reduced the bond for the four suspects charged with stealing Sh52 million from KCB’s Thika branch. Chief magistrate Theresa Murigi yesterday reduced the bond from Sh4 million with two sureties of an equal amount to Sh2 million with two sureties of a similar amount following an application by the defence to have the bond terms reviewed. Halford Munene, his brother Julius Ndung’u, Charles Mwangi and Shem Karani had failed to raise the bond and were still in police custody. Lawyer Waithera Mwangi representing the first three accused had applied for a review of the bond terms when the matter came up for mention on December 14, saying her clients are unable to raise the bond. She said her clients come from a humble background. Mwangi said her clients are not flight risks because two of them are married and have young families and the third is engaged. The prosecution led by state counsel Stella Oyagi objected the application saying investigations are still ongoing.
