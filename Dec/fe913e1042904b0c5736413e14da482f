Two men were on Friday afternoon arrested in Kwale with two pieces of ivory costing approximately Sh4m. Kenya Wildlife Service deputy warden Nathan Gatundu said one suspect was arrested at Tiribe while another was nabbed at Mtsangatamu. One pair of the ivory pieces weighed 34kg while the other weighed 16kg. "This means two elephants lost their lives. Replacing them will be difficult," Nathan said. The KWS official added that the ivory was not fresh saying the suspects had sought a buyer by the time of their arrest. The two were detained at Diani police station and will be arraigned on Monday.
