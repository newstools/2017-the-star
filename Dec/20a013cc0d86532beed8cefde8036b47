Manufacturers of disciplined forces’ leather products will from next financial year be required to procure hides and skins from local suppliers, President Uhuru Kenyatta has directed. In the same breath, the head of state instructed that all boots, leather products and textiles for the disciplined forces be procured from local manufacturers. Delivering his Jamhuri Day speech, the President noted that this was one of the incentives to local industry. Kenyatta regretted that while Kenyans purchase more than 30 million pairs of shoes yearly, only a small fraction is made locally. He said local sourcing of raw hides was one of the strategies the Government is going to use to revive the manufacturing industry and take it to the next level. He further called on farmers to take interest in cotton farming to revive the textile industry assuring government’s support to the sector. “If the cotton for the fabric were grown and woven locally, we would raise revenues from the current Sh30 billion to Sh200 billion,” Uhuru said. The President said the government will support value addition of agriculture production to enable Kenya to process her own produce and own the 70 per cent of the value of exports which would have otherwise been taken by processors abroad. He regretted that dealers branding Kenyan products current;y make more than 10 times what a Kenyan farmer makes. “Tea, coffee, meat, fruits and vegetables will be produced locally leading to creation of more jobs and wealth for Kenyans and generate more revenue for the country.” To boost the manufacturing sector, the President said the government will cut the cost of off-peak power to heavy industries by half, review work permit regime, protect intellectual property rights and work with the Kenya Revenue Authority as well as the Kenya Anti-Counterfeit Authority to destroy counterfeit products.
