David Saruni who captained Kenya during the World Under-18 championships last July in Nairobi has landed a scholarship to study in the United States. Saruni, who was disqualified during the championships in the semis due to lane infringement, said he is set to travel for studies at the Western Kentucky University early next year once all formalities are completed. “I’m happy because in the US, they have better facilities than Kenya. I will perfect my skills and become a better hurdler,” said Saruni. The 400m hurdler said he was identified by the university’s track and field head coach Eric Jenkins. “I have done my exams and I expect the results to be out soon,” said the former student at Mogonga Mixed Secondary School in Kisii County. He is targeting to represent Kenya at the World Under-20 championships to be held in Tampere, Finland as from July 19 to 24 next year. “We have agreed that I will come home for the U-20 trials. I’m confident I will make it to Team Kenya because I have rectified the mistakes which led to my disqualification in Nairobi,” said Saruni who hails from Narok County. “I was devastated when I was disqualified. I want to make up for the disqualification by making it to Finland,” said Saruni. He, however, said he will request for permission to attend the Commonwealth Games trials. Saruni, who also participates in the 100m, 200m, 400m and polevault wants to specialise in 400m hurdles. During the Athletics Kenya track and field meeting in Kisii last week, Saruni finished third in the 400m hurdles. Stephen Rotich won the race in 53:01 and was followed by Eric Kiptoo in second place. Kiproo clocked 53:08 while Saruni finished posted 54:01.
