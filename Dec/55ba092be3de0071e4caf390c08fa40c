At least 170 females underwent business training by business accelerator Sinapis on how to get their businesses ready for financing. The training, dubbed Raising Capital as a Female Entrepreneur, focused on unlocking the potential of people in a digital, fast and changing world through education.  The female entrepreneurs discussed challenges faced by women in business and the financial resources available for business growth.  “We empower aspiring entrepreneurs with innovative and scalable business ideas by providing them with a rigorous, world-class consulting and mentoring services and access to seed capital,” Sinapis co-founder Courtney Mills said.  She added that despite Kenya being a leading economic engine in East Africa, its tremendous challenges in developing a pipeline of entrepreneurs has inspired them to get into the business of empowering entrepreneurs.  Recent data from the Kenya Bankers Association indicate that majority of Kenyan start-ups fail within five years due to lack of mentorship from established entrepreneurs. The female entrepreneurs also took part in networking, interacting with the panelists and hearing about investor readiness from the Sinapis Kenya Country Manager, Silvya Kananu. Sinapis holds workshops bi-monthly and plans to hold its next meeting in January 2018.
