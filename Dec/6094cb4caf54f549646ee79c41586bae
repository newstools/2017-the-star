Kisumu Senator Fred Outa has promised to expose cartels in the county as his way of fighting corruption. Speaking in Nyakach on Monday, Outa said the previous administration was unable to deliver to residents because of graft perpetuated by cartels in the Lakeside town. He said he will sit back as county funds and looted by a few individuals. "My work as a senator is to blow the whistle against graft cases. We cannot allow a few people to enrich themselves at the expense of residents," Outa said. Outa said the cartels could easily destroy Governor Anyang' Nyong'o's image if left unchecked. "We will be vigilant to ensure illegal tenders are not awarded," Outa said. Outa denied any rifts between him and Nyong'o, saying some people were keen on driving a wedge between them. Reports of a fall-out emerged after the senator last week raised concerns about two county officials said to have irregularly awarded Sh200 million road tenders. Deputy Governor Mathews Owili said asked the two leaders to dialogue.  "I know there is no love lost between the governor and senator. I'm asking them to talk and consult as brothers," Owili said.
