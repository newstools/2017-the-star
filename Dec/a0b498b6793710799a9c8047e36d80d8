Lamu politician Rishad Amana has set his campaign machinery in motion in preparation for a possible by-election in the Lamu West constituency. Amana is buoyed by Wednesday’s court ruling in Malindi where judge Eldon Korir ordered a recount of votes. However, Amana had asked the court for a direct victory should it be found his win was stolen. Maendeleo Chap Chap’s Stanley Muthama had been declared the winner by IEBC returning officer Abdalla Chikophe. Muthama beat Amana by 140 votes after garnering 11,090 votes against the petitioner’s 10,950. The ruling gave the Lamu ODM point man confidence. “This is big win for us,” a happy Amana told the Star on the phone on Friday. Already, Amana has contacted his key campaign strategists and managers, and asked them to “prepare the ground”. “Immediately the court ordered a recount, he contacted us and told us to start work. He said should the court order a by-election, we should be ready.  “He is confident justice will prevail and he will be declared the winner directly by the court,” one of Amana’s aides told the Star on the phone on Friday. There are 122 polling stations in Lamu West constituency and a recount of all the votes will take at least three days. The recount will start after the Christmas festivities. “We will have a big victory after the recount. We are waiting for the deputy registrar to give us the way forward,” said Amana. Amana, however, said he will go with whatever the court will decide. “We pray this time we get justice because in 2013 we were denied justice. But it is all good, what we want is peace. “We accepted the first (Chief Justice David Maraga) ruling and we accepted the second too,” Amana said.
