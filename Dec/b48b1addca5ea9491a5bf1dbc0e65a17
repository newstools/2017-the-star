Oburu Oginga has defended his election to EALA and dismissed claims that he took Norman Magaya's slot. Oburu clarified that there is no way he would have taken Magaya's slot when Magaya was in ANC and he was in ODM despite both being in NASA. "Each party was given a chance to nominate its preferred candidates to EALA and ODM had two, ANC had three, Wiper three and so on, so any claims that I took Magaya's slot is foolhardy," said Oburu.

Oburu said everyone in NASA wished that Magaya would have been elected to EALA except the Jubilee legislatures that are planting the seed of disquiet within the opposition coalition. "Its unfortunate that there was some prejudice against Magaya by Jubilee legislatures who are now claiming that I took his slot," Oburu said. He said Magaya would be with him at EALA had it not been the conspiracy within Jubilee to advance their political witch-hunt. "We are aware that Jubilee is also electing ODM members unopposed to head house committees and again turn back to incite affiliate parties in Nasa against ODM for taking giant share," revealed Oburu. Oburu told Jubilee that not even such gorilla tactics will split Nasa as per their expectations affirming that Nasa will remain together until they solve the pending election impulses. "I know they are geared to split Nasa through the divide and rule scheme, but we are advising them to revisit their strategy as that will not work," said Oburu.
