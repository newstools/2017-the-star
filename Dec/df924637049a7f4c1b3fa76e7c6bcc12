The Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital is negotiating with
the government and international partners on plans to start manufacturing some
drugs and medical equipment locally.
 CEO Wilson Aruasa
said local manufacturing will help to cut costs of drugs and equipment
by about half, which will improve access to healthcare for Kenyans. He said the cost of a CT scan machine from Europe is Sh100 million but one manufactured locally would cost between Sh40 million and Sh50 million. "Local manufacturing through partnerships with international companies will be the best way to go so that we
cut costs medication in the country," he said. Aruasa also said the state commendation awarded to him by President Uhuru Kenyatta last week will inspire him to further improve services at the hospital.
