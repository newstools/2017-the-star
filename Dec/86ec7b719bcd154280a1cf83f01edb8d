Diamond Platnumz's mother has vowed to give birth to another baby to become Diamond's sibling. Talking to Tanzanian website Dizzim Online, Sanura Kassim, who likes to be called Sandrah Micheal, says she is ready to get pregnant for her hubby. And no, it's not Diamond Platnumz's dad. This celebrity mother has been rumoured to be dating a man younger than him and she says the two are already married. So, when will Diamond get a baby brother/sister? "Hahaa. Nasibu atapata mdogo wake...basi subirieni mdogo wake wa mwisho," she said. Sandrah is said to have ditched Diamond's father Abdul after he turned out to be deadbeat. The star's father has since then tried to get back to the family after the son got into the limelight and it seems nothing is working out for him.Â
