The Luhya community has identified a running mate for Deputy President William Ruto in 2022, Sirisia MP John Waluke (pictured) has said. He said the community is working on a plan to unite under Jubilee before the next General Election.  Although Waluke did not name the candidate, sources said it may be Water CS Eugene Wamalwa or former Budalang’i MP Ababu Namwamba. “We are sure Ruto will be the next President and, as Luhyas, we are targetting the number two slot,” he said on Saturday.  Waluke said he is aiming to be Bungoma governor in 2022 after serving as MP for two terms. “We are happy as a community that Uhuru and Ruto won the last election and we wish them a merry Christmas and a happy New Year as we start to focus on 2022 politics,” he said. Waluke, who spoke to journalists in Eldoret, said the DP is aware of the plan to have the Luhyas produce his running mate in 2022. “We have been working closely with the Jubilee leadership and the DP knows what I’m talking about ahead of 2022,” he said.  NASA, Waluke said, was “politically vanquished” after Uhuru and Ruto won and the Luhya community has no hope in either ODM, Wiper, Ford Kenya or ANC. Separately, a section of Gema leaders said they will front Devolution CS Mwangi Kiunjuri as Ruto’s running mate. “He has also proven to be an effective servant of the people, considering how he has performed since he joined the Cabinet,” organising secretary Paul Kinyanjui said. He said Kiunjuri is the senior-most politician in the Mt Kenya region and is capable of taking over the leadership mantle from Uhuru. Kinyanjui said the CS has represented the interests of the Gema community. Kiunjuri has in the recent past faced criticism from a section of Central Kenya leaders who say he should not be retained in Uhuru’s Cabinet.
