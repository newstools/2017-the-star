Kenya Police head coach Kenneth Kaunda has warned his side of complacency ahead of their Kenya Hockey Union (KHU) Premier League duel against Western Jaguars in Kakamega today. Kaunda, whose need at least nine points to win the 2017 championship, is fearful that his side could start celebrations way too early, putting at risk their chances of grabbing the title. He termed his opponents as potential candidates to break their unbeaten run and has advised his players to approach the match with the seriousness it deserves. Police, who enjoy a 15-point advantage over Greensharks, will have to aim they guns with precision if they are to get a result against a side that has proved a hard nut to crack, especially at home tis term. “It’s going to be a tough game. Jaguars are always hard to beat in their home-ground. I have cautioned my boys not to be over-excited of being close to the title. That’s is unacceptable at this time. We hope to score many goals in the game and keep on reducing the gap between us and the title. We always take a game at a time and hope to win this crucial away match. We have had training sessions throughout the week and I am confident we will win.” Today, at City Park, Butali Warriors play deposed defending champions Strathmore University Gladiators hoping to catch up with Kenya Police while Nairobi Sikh Union confront Parklands Sports Club. Tomorrow, Nakuru Hockey Club play Chase Sailors before paving way for a clash between Butali Warriors and USIU-A Mashujaa. Second-placed Greensharks will be out to cement their spot and hopefully reduce the gap between them and the law enforcers when they play Wazalendo. In the ladies Premier League, Chase Amira accost Sliders while Vikings entertain on-form Strathmore University Scorpions.
