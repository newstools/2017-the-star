The road was very muddy and quite slippery as I drove past the Hyena dam towards No4 junction. Suddenly on my left something caught my eye, it was a buffalo carcass. What impacted me most was the fact that the buffalo carcass was surrounded by long lush green grass and many wild flowers. Seeing this was tragic in that bush life is so tough for so many creatures, and the recent long drought had been broken by good rains resulting in so much new life everywhere. If only this buffalo and many others that also died could have had the strength to survive just a short while longer until the rains came. We will never know exactly why this buffalo died, however most likely a lack of nutrients weakened its immune system resulting in disease and ultimately death.  Nearby a herd of buffalo grazed peacefully on the green grasses. What a contrast, survival of the fittest, many of the weakest don’t make it and the strong survive. Recently my daughter who is a medical doctor at a hospital spoke to me and said “Life is so fragile!” Wild animals are much tougher than humans, this scene caused me to reflect on human life and the seasons we move through.  Sometimes we go through times when life is very difficult and tough, some people might even feel like giving up to their circumstances, but every season in life changes.  I pray that God will give us faith and the strength to hold on until life gets better. The seasons come and go, we can observe and learn life lessons from nature. Life on earth is short and is like “an apprenticeship for life in eternity!” I pray we be ready.
