Mumias Knut officials have opposed the Education ministry’s new directive that primary and secondary schools in the same compound share head teachers. On Tuesday, Mumias and Matungu subcounties Knut secretary general John Wesonga said there should have been consultations before the decision was made. He termed the directive “unrealistic”. Wesonga said the directive is not viable as the duties of a primary head are different from those of a secondary school principal. “Managing a primary school is quite different from running a secondary school. There is no way you can have the two working harmoniously,” Wesonga said.  Education CS Fred Matiang’i on Monday said the directive should be implemented soon. He said the dismal performance of some schools is due to poor management.  The ministry says the move will ensure the schools will utilise available resources efficiently. These schools will share the same boards of management with one overall principal and two deputies. Already, the Kenya Primary School Heads Teachers Association have opposed to the new directive. Led by secretary general David Mavuta, the heads fear they may lose their jobs to their secondary school counterparts.
