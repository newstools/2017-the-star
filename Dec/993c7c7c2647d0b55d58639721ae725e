Mandera Governor Ali Roba has urged fellow leaders and residents to fight the urge to engage in negative politics, hatred, finger-pointing and manipulation. Political squabbles do not serve anyone’s interest, he said. The governor has had a frosty relationship with MCAs allied to the Economic Freedom Party, which holds the majority of seats. “There is need to look ahead together and resist being drawn into the dangerous bitterness that would hold us back and pull us apart,” Roba said. He spoke after handing over milk value-addition equipment to Mandera East Milk sellers saccos on Thursday. Milk is a major source of income. Roba said the county is redesigning staff management in all departments to improve services, fight graft and impunity. “We are aware the process, which inevitably involves disciplinary action, including demotion, will very likely create discomfort among the workforce and some members of the public,” he said. It will be impartial, Roba said.
