MPs are unhappy following the delayed release of Sh30.9 billion CDF money while warning that the kitty is central to their core responsibility. The MPs demanded Treasury CS Henry Rotich to release the 2017-18 funds although Majority leader Aden Duale yesterday told the Star gazetting the constituency CDF officials caused the delay. “There was no way the Treasury CS could release money when the CDF committees have not been legally gazetted. The constituency committee members have been approved by the House, they were gazetted last Friday and now the minister will release the funds this week,” Duale told Star on phone.

Its daily operations are with the constituency Constituency Development Committees,” Duale said. Last Wednesday afternoon session turned stormy when members demanded answers from National Assembly leadership following Duale's earlier assurance that money would be released by December 1.

However, our own welfare and our funds, which we oversee, are not yet in place. Do you think we will be in a conducive environment to do such things if the welfare of members is not considered?” Lomenen said. Click here for the latest political news.
