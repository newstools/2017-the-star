Wetang’ula said the Jubilee administration has denied Kenyans meaningful development.  “If Uhuru wants to talk about development, he must start by talking about the bad politics that has denied mwanachi meaningful development,” he said. Wetang’ula said politics continue to divide Kenyans along ethnic lines.  “It is the issue we must address first because that is why some regions are lagging behind in terms of development,” he said. “Skewed development is caused by bad politics.
