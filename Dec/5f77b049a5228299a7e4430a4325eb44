East African securities regulators have partnered with communication regulators to investigate violations in capital markets by obtaining telecommunications related information. In a statement last week, regulators said the move is aimed at strengthening the existing laws and harmonising provision on the prohibition on the use of non-public information for one’s own interest. Those trading on privileged information or intentionally engaging in actions aimed at circumventing the law to benefit themselves are also targeted in this process. The collaboration agreement also included check-lists on licensing and public offers of securities intended to inform the market on the basic submission requirements for their application to the authorities. Due to this investigation, the five capital markets regulators agreed to amend the existing Memorandums of understanding with the regulators of accounting professions in their respective jurisdiction. This is to enable effective cooperation during the period especially on matters related to financial reporting by listed entities. With the global financial crisis and its effects in mind, the regulators approved a regional policy for crisis management across the East African region to respond to systemic shocks emanating from a crisis. The approval is aimed at ensuring stability across the capital markets in the region.
