The mode of arrest by the police of NASA chief strategist
David Ndii was wrong.  Seven officers from the Flying Squad and the Special
Crime Prevention Unit intercepted Dr Ndii as he walked with his 11-year-old
daughter into a restaurant for dinner at the Leopard Beach Resort, Kwale county,
on Sunday afternoon.  Identifying themselves as police officers they asked him
to step aside for a word. Two of the officers were armed. What followed was a medley of denials by senior police
officers about holding anyone by Ndii’s name. He was brought to Nairobi by road and held at DCI
headquarters. Dramatic arrests amid police denials, some of them based on
ignorance and others disingenuous, are typical of non-democratic regimes. People of Dr Ndii’s stature and repute should be asked to
present themselves to the police, not arrested in practically breach-of-the-peace
style, leaving a wife and a daughter anxious and increasingly traumatised. Being taken away by night by seven armed men by road from
Nairobi to Mombasa can be needlessly frightening.
