Once again and on home soil, Harambee Stars have the opportunity to assert their status as the region’s top dogs when they battle Zanzibar in the final of this year’s Cecafa Senior Challenge Cup tomorrow. That tag has fallen to Uganda for the better part of the past decade but with Stars having marched the Cranes’ success in the tournament during the last two editions, tomorrow’s final will be an opportunity for them to regain the regional kingpin tag. However, coach Paul Put has been left with a major headache following the match-readiness of three of his key players. Captain Musa Mohammed and forward Vincent Oburu picked injuries in the semi final win over Burundi in Kisumu on Thursday while striker, Masoud Juma missed out due to injury. “The injuries are a big concern to us. They will be assessed by the medical team but I doubt they will recuperate ahead of the match because we don’t have enough time,” said Put. Zaznibar defied difficult all odds to reach the final, beating holders Uganda 2-1 at the Moi Stadium in Kisumu yesterday. From the start of the tournament, odds were stuck against the Heroes, but Hemed Morocco’s men doggedly went about their business and have now been rewarded with a first final since 1995 and their fourth overall in the regional competition.  Zanzibar took the lead in the 22nd minute when Abdulaziz Makame reacted first to a poor clearance form Nicholas Wadada to dispatch Salum Abubakar’s corner but Uganda needed just six minutes to level matters.  Muzamir Mutyaba combined with Moody kawesa who let the ball roll for Nsibanga Derrick to beat Mohammed Ahmed and get the Cranes back in the game.  It was an advantage the record Cecafa winners failed to take and were punished five minutes after the break when Nsumbuga Joseph was shown a straight red card for a professional foul in the box on Amad Mohammed.  From the ensuing penalty Issa Juma sent Ismael Watenga the wrong way to put Zanzibar back in front and into the final.
