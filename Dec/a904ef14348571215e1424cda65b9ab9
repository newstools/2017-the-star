Private schools in Mombasa have welcomed the 2-6-3-3 curriculum, saying they are ready for its rollout in January. More than 200 teachers and 50 directors of private schools have been successfully inducted on the new system set to replace the 32-year-old 8-4-4 syllabus. They said the new curriculum will be easier to implement. Alternative Providers for Basic Education and Training secretary general Juma Lubambo said focus on talent development for the child inspires hope among many stakeholders. “The new system is more relevant to Kenyans and has less workload for teachers,” Lubambo said. He spoke on Wednesday evening at the Vision of Hope Children’s Centre in Miritini. The Education ministry plans to roll out the new curriculum when schools open next week. The Kenya National Union of Teachers has called for the postponement of the new system, saying some schools are not ready.  Lubambo said the new system will allow teachers to focus their energies on specific talents in learners for quality education.
