see us paying this amount in the near future,” he added. “For now I cannot comment on existence of projects, whether they
are of quality and have been completed, all will be known by this fresh audit,” Korane added. The county boss said the audit team should provide proof of what services were rendered, projects implemented fully and their quality.
