Wyre, born Kevin Waire, is promoting and nurturing talents of youths in Turkana through the “Finding a Star” Project in collaboration with an organisation called FilmAid.  Two of Kakuma’s finest, Akuot and Scoobylincos, are set to be unveiled at a launch concert on December 8. The event will include mass outreach, musical performances from the two artistes and a guest performance by Wyre. Akuot will be launching the single Anavyonifanya, while Scoobylincos will be debuting Kazi Tu. The two are excited to show fans that Turkana's got talent. “I am so excited that we are finally showing our fans in Kakuma what we have been up to in the past couple of months. It has been an exciting journey for me as an artiste, and I thank FilmAid and Wyre for walking with me on this musical journey,” Akuot said.
