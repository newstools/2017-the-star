The government will use Industrialised Building Systems to build more than 500,000 housing units for Kenyans over five years. Housing and Urban Development PS Idah Munano yesterday said the technology will ensure houses are built in seven days — not the six months that normal construction takes. She said the system is used in many developed countries and involves developing parts of a house in a factory. Munano said the government has done a sample house that only took one week to complete. She spoke at Kahuhia Girls’ High School during the Kenya Anglican Youth Association meeting on Friday. She said the programme will enjoy integrated support from all government departments to ensure it is well implemented. “The entire government will be working together to ensure roads, water, infrastructure and energy are entrenched in the programme,” Munano said. She said the government is now looking at land banking to create enough space for the construction. The government is holding talks with the county governments to help manage the programme because they understand the needs of their residents better, Munano said. “We are also reaching out to private developers to find out what incentives we can offer them so they establish affordable housing units,” she added. The PS expressed shock that only 22,000 people are servicing mortgages in the country — against more than 10 million people in the workforce.
