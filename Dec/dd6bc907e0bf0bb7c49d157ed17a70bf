More than 2,000 girls from the Pokot community in Tiaty, Baringo county, are undergoing female genital mutilation, despite the government ban. On Wednesday, a source from Tiaty subcounty, who sought anonymity, told the media some girls from the Pokot community were recuperating in the bush after undergoing the cut. The source also said traditional women circumcisers are paid at least two goats or Sh3,000 to cut one girl.

However, he said a "suitor" should be ready to part with livestock as dowry to get the circumcised girl as a wife. The source said one should at least part with 50 goats, 30 cows and 10 camels to get a "wife". “That is why Pokot men raid their neighbouring pastoral communities to get livestock to pay dowry,” the source said. On Thursday, Baringo county commissioner Peter Okwanyo blamed the deep-rooted cultural practices in Tiaty to illiteracy and lack of awareness. He spoke at Kabarnet Museum Grounds.

The others have graduated,” Okwanyo said. He, however, did not say what the government is doing to stop the outdated practice. He said education has set free the neighbouring Ilchamus, Tugens and Marakwet communities from the outlawed practices. Okwanyo directed chiefs and village elders to identify the culprits, arrest them and hand them over to the police, saying illiteracy and ignorance is not an excuse for one to break the law. In attendance were Baringo Deputy Governor Jacob Chepkwony, Devolution executive Maureen Rotich and Gender chief officer Enock Kiptaiwa. Click here for the latest political news
