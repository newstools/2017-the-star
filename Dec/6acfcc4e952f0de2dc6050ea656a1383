The government will grow food on all idle land, Agriculture CS Willy Bett has said. He was addressing farmers on Saturday at the NCPB depot in Eldoret, where he inspected the purchase of maize under the Strategic Grain Reserve plan. Bett said the land will be leased out to farmers or investors. Although he did not say the acres targeted in Rift Valley, sources said they could be more than 400,000 acres. “We will not interfere with anyone’s land, but we want to make it accessible to other people who can use it for food production to benefit the country,” Bett said. Owners of idle land will not lose it. The government has identified at least 60,000 acres for the programme. “The aim is to ensure we produce adequate food so that we don’t have shortages yet we have too much land lying idle in the country”, Bett said.  Governor Jackson Mandago said investigations are ongoing to arrest individuals who steal subsidised fertiliser.
