Attorney General Githu Muigai yesterday lashed out at Siaya Senator James Orengo for his “misinformed remarks” on treason. Githu said the current crop of “lawyer politicians” are hell-bent on misleading the public. He made the remarks during the launch of the National Action Plan on Legal Aid at a Nairobi Hotel. “They call themselves lawyer politicians others public intellectuals, who comment on every issue. The more ignorant they are, the louder they are,” he said. The AG urged young lawyers present at the launch to step up and help improve public discourse, which has deteriorated on issues of human rights, law, sovereignty and integrity.

But Orengo dismissed the AG, saying “he needs to go back to law school”. He accused Githu of using threats, intimidation and blackmail, which will not cow the Opposition. “His statements have no imprints on the law of the land and the Constitution. It actually made him look like a propagandist for the ruling party. Kenya is not a colony anymore. We expect him to talk for the country and not only as chief legal advisor for the government,” Orengo said.
