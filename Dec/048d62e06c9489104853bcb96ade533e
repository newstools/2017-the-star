Diamond Platnumz's mother Sanura Kassim seems to be fed up with the whole Hamisa Mobeto drama. Hamisa is the socialite cum model who gave birth a child with Diamond Platnumz and has since been at loggerheads with Zari Hassan. A day doesn't go by before the two exchange nasty insults online. On December 21, both Zari and Hamisa headlined major parties in Uganda, but Zari brought Kampala to a standstill. Her all-white party was packed, compared to Hamisa’s, which was attended by only a handful of people. Zari took to Snapchat to thank her supporters for coming out in large numbers, saying that haters can’t stop her from doing what she loves. This did not go well with Hamisa, who felt that Zari had attacked her. She shot back, "We endelea kulia kuvishwa pete wakati mwenzako mume wa mtu tayari." Hamisa called Zari an old granny, who is older than her mother. "I am the age of your first daughter... and you're three years older than my mother. She has always told me to respect her peers and age mates. I respect the two generation[s] you have served ahead of my arrival on this earth." Well, Diamond Platnumz's mother, who seems to be siding with her daughter-in-law Zari, has told off Hamisa. "Dawa ya mbu anayeambukiza malaria si kumpiga bunduki ni repellent [doom] tu," she wrote on Instagram.
