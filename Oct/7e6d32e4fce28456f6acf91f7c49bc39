Nzoia Sugar Cane Outgrowers company yesterday demanded an advance payments scheme to help farmers waiting for crops to mature. Company chairman Christopher Sifuna said farmers need cash to survive because cane takes 18 months to mature. â€˜â€™Most of our farmers depend on sugarcane as the main cash crop and source of income.  â€œThey need to be advanced finances on the strength of standing cane in order to address their pressing financial needs,â€™â€™ he said. Sifuna spoke in Bungoma town yesterday after receiving farmer delegations at his Luyekhe village home in Kanduyi.  He praised President Uhuru Kenyatta for providing Sh300million to pay farmers who had been waiting for three months. Sifuna said clearance of the farmersâ€™ arrears has helped reduce poaching by private millers as his members could no longer sell to brokers at throw-away prices. â€œâ€˜Our members are at times forced to sell the crop to middlemen due to financial difficulties,â€ he said.
