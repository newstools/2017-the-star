Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua has urged the High Court to dismiss the petition filed by Wavinya Ndeti, saying it lacks merit. Mutua’s team of 15 lawyers on Wednesday cited “massive defects” in Ndeti’s petition. The matter was tabled during the pre-trial conference. Mutua based his arguments on various legal-technical grounds, among them failure by the petitioner to enjoin Deputy Governor Francis Maliti as a respondent. “This is incurably and fatally defective since Article 180( 5 ) of the Constitution mandates a county governor to nominate a qualified person to be elected as a deputy governor,” he said. Mutua said a governor is legally elected enjoined with his deputy and the two are inseparable, as they were elected by the same voter. Ndeti filed the petition citing massive irregularities. She says there was massive rigging and Forms 37A, 37B and 37C were not signed as a result. Ndeti says there were non-existent polling stations. She filed a 10,000-page petition early last month. But Mutua said, “The receipt of this petition was not acknowledged by the registrar, therefore breaching the mandatory provisions of the law and, as such, the same is incurably defective and must be struck out.”
