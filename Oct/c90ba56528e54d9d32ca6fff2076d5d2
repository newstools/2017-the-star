Forty-four inmates at the Naivasha prison are set to seat this year’s KCPE exam. Of the number, 17 are serving life and death sentences. Institution’s welfare officer Mose Kodek yesterday said the number of those enrolling for education at the prison has been rising steadily over the years. “This year’s number of KCPE candidates is an increase from last year’s 35. We are set for the exam that officially kicks off Tuesday,” he said. Kodek said lack of training materials and qualified teachers are the main challenges the institution has been facing. “We have been forced to use fellow inmates as teachers. They have performed beyond our expectations, despite the challenges,” he said. Officer in charge Patrick Mwenda was on Saturday feted with the Outstanding Correctional Service Employee Award in the continent. During the ceremony, held in the UK, Mwenda was recognised by the International Corrections and Prisons Association for his exemplary work. The association recognised the officer for his work in rehabilitating hundreds of inmates through education and vocational courses.
