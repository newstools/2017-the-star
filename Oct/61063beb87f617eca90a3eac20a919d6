Deputy President William Ruto is forming his 2022 presidential campagin team and former Senator Hassan Omar is a key player in Mombasa. On Monday, Ruto endorsed Omar for the governor seat in 2022 in front of Jubilee candidate Suleiman Shahbal and President Uhuru Kenyatta. While inviting Omar to speak, Ruto said, â€œHaiya. Wa mwisho ni ndugu yetu, seneta wa zamani, kwa mapenzi ya Mungu, atakayekuwa gavana, In Sha Allah, wa Mombasa hii, Senator Hassan Omar Sarai. (Okay. Lastly, itâ€™s our brother, former senator, who, God willing, will become governor of Mombasa, Senator Hassan Omar Sarai.â€) order of speaking The order of speaking also pointed to the importance Ruto and Jubilee leaders attached to Omar. The former Wiper secretary general spoke just before Uhuru and was introduced by Ruto himself. Other leaders were invited to speak by Tourism CS and Jubilee Coast point man-designate Najib Balala. The exception was former Taita Taveta Governor John Mruttu who also defected to Jubilee from ODM,  Sources indicate Omar was fronted by Balala, who insiders say is more comfortable working with Omar than with Shahbal. Omar said he and Balala respect each other and always consulted one another on issues affecting Mombasa, despite being in different camps.  â€œI have never had a person in Jubilee who has respected me and supported me, not necessarily in the election, like Najib Mohamed Balala,â€ he said. In 2013, Omar beat Balala to win the Senate seat. Omar said Balala then called him and assured him of his full, unequivocal support. He also heaped praise on Ruto, saying the Deputy President was the first to call him after his August 8 loss to Governor Hassan Joho.
