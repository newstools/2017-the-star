Kenya is headed for a fraught period in the week beginning
on Monday October 2, the day NASA has designated as the beginning of mass
weekly protests to be held every Monday and Friday until further notice.  The opposition has called for this option in protest at
Parliamentâ€™s Jubilee Party majority amendment of the election laws. Ten years ago in the post-election violence crisis, mass
protests quickly developed into mass action, which was generalized violence in
which roads were blocked, a railway uprooted, there was looting and burning and
displacement. Fears of a repeat of the PEV and its mindless deadly ethnic
clashes after the 2007 poll will be much on the minds of Kenyans in the course
of the week. A return to the PEV is unacceptable and would endanger lives
and property. Kenya must not burn again and this needs to be impressed
upon President Kenyatta and NASA leader Raila Odinga and the hardliners who
surround them by all men and women and young people of goodwill.
