The quest to form a united front by Coast MPs may be hampered by selfish interests and greed for power. A day after 20 Coast MPs vowed, in Kinango, to work together for the benefit of residents, party politics and self interest took centre stage at NASA’s mega rally in Mama Ngina Grounds in Mombasa on Sunday. Youthful men Coast MPs, most of them first-timers, wanted to make good their threat to walk out of the NASA rally should there be any indication of favouritism. However, they decided against it as they felt it would have embarrassed both Governor Hassan Joho and the NASA principals, especially Raila Odinga. The rally was the first test of the unity resolve. The Star has learnt the MPs texted each other at the rally as soon as signs of trouble started, but it was then agreed they stay put. “In the lineup, we saw that some people, who are not MPs, were scheduled to speak, yet MPs were to be locked out. This did not go down well with us,” a Coast MP, who was present at the Kinango Declaration on Saturday, said. At Tsunza Primary School in Kinango constituency on Saturday, 20 MPs vowed to set aside their party differences and work together to develop the Coast region and ensure they have a bigger political voice in the country. The MPs, most of them in their early and mid-30s, said if they remain united, they will be able to solve long-standing problems at the Coast, including the land and the squatter issue, joblessness and marginalisation. “This is the unity of the Coast. The journey has started and will not stop. We will walk together from Lunga Lunga to Kiunga to unite Coast residents. We will fight for the rights of all Coast residents,” Kisauni MP Ali Mbogo said on Saturday. On Sunday, signs of trouble were seen when former Kisauni MP Rashid Bedzimba stood and moved towards the front of the dais as if to speak, prompting protests, believed to be from Mbogo in the crowd. Mbogo defeated Bedzimba, who is a close ally of Joho, in the August 8 polls. Joho was then seen consulting with Mbogo. Bedzimba did not end up speaking. Some MPs felt some of their colleagues are favoured by the NASA principals and other powerful leaders in the alliance. Likoni MP Mishi Mboko and her Malindi counterpart Aisha Jumwa were allowed to speak. “To avoid trouble, we as the male Coast MPs and Senators, took a stand that we will let MP Dori speak on our behalf,” Mbogo told the Star on the phone yesterday. Msambweni MP Sulaimen Dori is the Coast Parliamentary Group chairman. He is one of the proponents of the unity of all Coast MPs. Mvita MP Abdulswamad Nassir spoke at the rally by virtue of being the host legislator. A source told the Star there was a push for Bedzimba to speak prior to the protests in the crowd. “We know who was pushing for Bedzimba to speak. We are watching them keenly. If we feel they will derail us in our unity quest, we will move forward without them,” an MP said on condition of anonymity. Political analyst Philip Kaulu said the Coast unity ‘song’ has become a clichÃ©. “Selfishness and egocentrism are the major undoing of Coast leaders in the quest to speak with one voice,” he said. Kaulu said unless the Coast MPs agree to drop their egos and rally behind one central leader, there will always be infighting. “Unity cannot come from several centres of power. There must be one centre of power behind which the others follow,” Kaulu said. He cited the Ukambani resolve with NASA co-principal Kalonzo Musyoka, Central with President Uhuru Kenyatta, Nyanza with Raila Odinga and Rift Valley with William Ruto. “It will also be difficult for the new MPs to unite the Coast region because there are both internal and external factors that need experience to solve. The old guard should lead this quest for unity,” Kaulu said.
