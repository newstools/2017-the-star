Kembi Gitura excited Murang'a with a new look during President Uhuru Kenyatta's tour of the county on Saturday. The former Senator had not graced public functions after losing to Irungu Kang'ata in the August 8 general election. He resurfaced yesterday to campaign for President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto ahead of the repeat October 26 election.

"Our former Senator has really excited the crowd with his new look. It seems life from the public eye is doing him good. That look depicts him as a man full of wisdom," said resident Joseph Kigo. Gitura is fondly referred to as guka, which means 'grandfather'. The politician asked about 80,000 voters who did not cast their ballots in August to ensure Uhuru wins by a big margin. "Our concern is not the over 400,000 who turned up...those we know already made up their minds. We are now pushing for the other voters who did not show up for whatever reason," he said. "It is imperative they show up and ensure Uhuru retains his seat after the election."
