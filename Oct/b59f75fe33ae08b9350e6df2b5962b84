The construction of sh.1 billion Trans Nzoia Teaching and referral hospital will be completed soon, Governor Patrick Khaemba has said. Speaking in Kitale on Monday, Khaemba said the hospital is among his key flagship projects initiated by his government in his first term in the office. The hospital which was under construction was bought at sh.185 million but on its completion will see the county use sh. 1 billion before equipping it. Already the national government has shown interest to equip the hospital once itâ€™s completed. â€œWe will soon be among a few counties in Kenya that have the right infrastructure to provide quality and affordable healthcareâ€ Khaemba said in Kitale.  It is in this second term that we will complete and operationalize the Hospital, which is a huge investment, said Khaemba adding that there is need for the MCAs and other elected leaders to support the completion of the project. â€œThis is a state-of-the-art facility that will bring down the cost of medical care and provide a healthcare economy that will yield jobs for our people â€œhe said.
