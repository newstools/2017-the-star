The Federation of Women Lawyers yesterday condemned the Tuesday shooting of Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu’s driver even as they empathised with her. “Fida Kenya stand with the family of Justice Mwilu and that of her driver. The experience is traumatising and unfortunate to our country,” Fida chairperson Josephine Mong’are said in a press statement. Constable Titus Musyoka was shot three times by unknown assailants along Ngong Road, shortly after he had dropped Mwilu (pictured) at her Karen home. The attackers made away with his gun. Mong’are called for speedy investigations and arrest of those involved in the shooting. “Once again, Fida condemns any form of perceived intimidation towards women in public office. We call for enhanced security for women leaders, especially judges,” Mong’are said.  Fida also called for an end to violence which has been witnessed in some parts of the country like Migori, where police clashed with protesters.
