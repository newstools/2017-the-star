Witchcraft killers who mutilate cows are plaguing Kuresoi, Nakuru county, and Kalenjin elders promise to punish them. The elders said the bizarre nighttime killings are a threat to their culture. And they are on the rise. Veteran athlete Kipkirui Misoi and Kuresoi North MP Moses Cheboi are among those whose cows have been mutilated and killed.  More than 100 cows have been killed in less than a year. Their right eyes are gouged out and genitals chopped off. Residents want the elders to perform traditional rituals to punish culprits and end the killings. “Cows are more than livestock to our community. Such killings will not be taken lightly.  “The perpetrators will not go unpunished even if they hide,” elder Gabriel Kipsamain said.
