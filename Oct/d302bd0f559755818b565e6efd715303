The Health ministry has set up an isolation facility at KNH to prevent the spread of Marburg virus disease and plague, which have been reported in Uganda and Madagascar. The World Health Organisation on Friday reported an outbreak of MVD in Kween district of eastern Uganda. The area borders Kenya’s Bungoma county. Two people have died of MVD and 200 are suspected to have been exposed to the virus during the burial of a victim. Director of Medical Services Jackson Kioko (pictured) yesterday said, in a statement, that aircraft from Madagascar and Uganda must submit health declaration forms to be allowed into the country. He outlined a raft of measures the ministry will enforce to prevent an outbreak. The WHO estimates that 50 -80 per cent of infected people may die from the disease. The current wave of plague was reported in August. Of the 849 cases reported so far , 74 people have died , while 49 healthcare workers have contracted the disease in Madagascar. A WHO risk assessment report says Kenya is at moderate risk of potential spread of plague, as there are more than 20 weekly flights between Madagascar and Kenya. Ships from Madagascar will also be required to submit maritime health declaration forms and deratting certificates. Scanners, medical supplies and personal protective equipment have also been provided in high-risk counties and points of entry. Travellers and crew members of vessels from the two countries must be screening and be subjected to surveillance.
