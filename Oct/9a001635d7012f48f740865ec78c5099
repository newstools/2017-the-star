The heads of Somalia’s police and national security have been sacked after a bombing targeting a hotel in the country’s capital claimed at least 29 lives. "Somalia’s police commander General Abdihakin Saiid and director general of the National Intelligence Security Agency Abdullahi Ali, have now been sacked after a cabinet meeting," state radio reported on its website on Sunday. An attack on the hotel in Mogadishu ended on Sunday after 29 people were killed during a siege lasting nearly 12 hours, police said. The attack proved once again that insurgents can carry out deadly assaults in the heart of the Somali capital. Twin bombings in Mogadishu two weeks ago killed more than 350 people, the worst such attacks in the country's history.
