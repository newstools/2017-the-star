There was a large voter turnout in Uasin Gishu and other parts of the North Rift region as residents participated in yesterday’s election. Long queues were witnessed at polling stations in Eldoret town as the voters waited to cast their ballots. The voters had lined up from as early as 5.30am despite the polling stations opening at 6am. Voting was faster than on August 8, with only one ballot to be cast. Uasin Gishu returning officer Jackstonne Nyonje said they had not experienced any difficulties. “We are going on well and we have adequate security in all areas to ensure that voting goes on smoothly,” Nyonje said. Deputy President William Ruto was among those who voted in the area. Ruto cast his ballot at Kosachei Primary School, in Turbo constituency, a few minutes after 10am. Governor Jackson Mandago and Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi said they were impressed with the turnout. Most businesses in Eldoret town were shut down following orders by Mandago to enable residents participate in the election. Uasin Gishu is largely considered to be a Jubilee stronghold and is Ruto’s political bedrock. However, only a handful of people voted in Langas, where NASA leader Raila Odinga enjoys massive support. “The good thing is that there is peace and security is tight,” Jubilee politician Joseph Wainaina said. Uasin Gishu county commissioner Abdi Hassan said they had not experienced any challenges in the region. Other key political leaders who voted in the region included MPs Swarrup Mishra (Kesses), Janet Koech (Turbo), Caleb Kostany (Soy) and William Chepkut (Ainabkoi).
