Acting Interior CS Fred Matiang’i says he is a member of Chinkororo and assured the group of protection. Former Internal Security minister Prof George Saitoti banned the militia in 2010 alongside other 40 groups. On Tuesday in Kisii, Matiang’i told the group to deal ruthlessly with people who opposed the October 26 General Election. “I am in charge of security. The youth who are here if anyone tries to block you from voting, I can order the police to look aside and you rough them up,” the CS said. Matiang’i told Chinkororo members in the region to rough up President Uhuru Kenyatta’s critics. The CS praised the militia for protecting the Kisii-Maasai border. “Anyone who is joking does not know Chinkororo. I’m one of them,” Matiang’i said. The CS made the remarks in front of Deputy President William Ruto in Etago, South Mugirango. The DP was holding campaign rallies in the region. “Let us unite with other people, Kenyans. The Gusii people are spread out across the country. “We should not make decisions that may harm to our people.Let’s not join battles we know little about that might result to our people being killed,” Matiang’i said. “As your son, I’m humbly requesting one thing from you. Let’s not ashame these leaders. Let’s vote for them. They love us, and will announce the projects they have for us when in government,” he said. In 2007, militia gangs were heavily involved in post-election violence, which left more than 1,500 people dead. ICC opened cases against Uhuru and Ruto, which were terminated in 2014 after the ICC Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda alleged lack of cooperation from Kenya.
