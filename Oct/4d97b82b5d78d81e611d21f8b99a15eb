More than  100, 000 residents of Pokot North subcounty facing starvation  have urged the national government to supply relief food. The dry spell whih has lasted for months has forced many residents to survive on bold and milk as they travel kilometres in search of water and pasture for their livestock. Speaking at Kour sub-location in Kacheliba constituency, some residents said lack of food has also made many school children drop out.  Grace Kapelile, a resident from Ompolion village,  said there is only  one water pan that serves the entire community as well as livestock. She said residents did not plant crops during the short rains because the area is arid. “Many children do not go to school because there is no food,” Kapelile said.
