Low voter turnout in most parts of the Rift Valley surprised Jubilee leaders, though they said the votes were enough to give President Uhuru Kenyatta victory. Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago, who led Jubilee campaigns in the region, on Friday said though they anticipated a high turnout, most areas recorded 50 to 60 per cent. “Many voters seemed tired with the move to repeat the election, but we are happy what we got will give Uhuru the win to go back to State House,” he said. He said democracy is about the majority having their way and clearly President Kenyatta had a majority of Kenyans on his side. In Soy constituency, Uasin Gishu county, there was a 62 per cent voter turnout, Turbo had 49 per cent, Ainabkoi had 67 per cent and Kapseret 54 per cent. Most constituencies in Nandi and Elgeyo Marakwet recorded voter turnouts of 50 and 70 per cent. Other constituencies results indicated Marakwet West had 71 per cent turnout, Aldai 78 per cent and Tinderet had 80 per cent. Tiaty had about 48 per cent turnout and Marakwet East had 78 per cent  Mandago denied the election had caused a major split among Kenyans, saying it was about a political contest, not unity. “Kenyans are united and Jubilee remains the majority party in the country. We now need to move on as a country,” he said. He said it was not Jubilee’s fault that some Kenyans decided to boycott the election after the Supreme Court ruled that there should be a repeat.  Governors Alex Tolgos of Elgeyo Marakwet and Stephen Sang of Nandi said they were satisfied with turnout. “There are so many factors that can lead to such a turnout, but in general we are happy that everything went on peacefully,” Sang said. Heavy rains and fear were also blamed for a lower turnout. IEBC officials said they were happy that voting and tallying had been peaceful. “We had no incidents reported and we can say the process was smooth,”Uasin Gishu returning officer Jacktonne Nyonje said.
