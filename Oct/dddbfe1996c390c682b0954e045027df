The IEBC is free to meet NASA’s demands as long as the October 26 poll is not derailed, DP William Ruto has said.  He was addressing Foreign Correspondents Association of East Africa members in his residence in Nairobi yesterday. Ruto said Jubilee is ready for the poll and won’t interfere with the electoral body. “If they chose to have a discussion with our competitors on firing a member(s) of staff or changing a supplier, it is fine. As long as there is an election, we will participate,” the DP said. He accused NASA leader Raila Odinga of giving the IEBC tough conditions and misinterpreting the Constitution. “In my honest assessment, Raila is running away from a humiliating defeat. But we have rolled up our sleeves. Whether he participates or not is his choice,” he said. He said Raila is planning to run for president in 2022. The former Prime Minister bolted out of the fresh presidential polls after sensing he would be floored by his main challenger – President Uhuru Kenyatta, Ruto said. “Maybe this is a strategy for him to face me in 2022. We would love Raila to participate in the rerun, but we cannot force him. It is his choice,” Ruto said. The DP rubbished calls for dialogue with the NASA leader. He said fair competition should take place. “What does a political settlement mean? Does it mean there will be no competition? They want the international community to force Kenyans to negotiate in an unconstitutional manner,” he said. Ruto said he was Raila’s ally during the 2007 General Election, but later parted ways after a disagreement. “The 2007 election had serious issues. We parted ways with Raila because we did not agree,” Ruto said. He defended the contentious Election Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2017. He said any Kenyan has the right to challenge its legality.
