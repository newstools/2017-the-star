Police are hunting for suspects involved in wide-circulation of leaflets in Lugari constituency, threatening one of the communities in the area to leave because of participating in the repeat presidential election. The leaflets have sparked off tensions in the constituency which is within Kakamega county. Area MP Ayub Savula has condemned the circulation of the leaflets and asked members of the Kikuyu community to stay put as they would be protected. Savula said residents who participated in the October 26 polls should not panic because it was their democratic right to do so. Among the areas the leaflets were circulated were Mwamba, Mautuma, Lumakanda, Lugari and Kipkaren market centres, which are largely inhabited by members of several communities. Some of the market centre lie on the border with Uasin Gishu county. “From the way the leaflets are printed, it appears they were done by some people with money and with the intention of causing ethnic chaos in the region. But I, as the area MP, will not accept that,” Savula told the Star on the phone. He said he had already talked to IGP Joseph Boinnet and asked him to ensure that those involved in circulation the hate leaflets are arrested and taken to court. “Personally, I went to school with members of the Kikuyu community, many of whom were born and brought in Lugari. I will not accept anyone to take advantage of politics to cause political animosity between our people,” he said. Senior police officers in the area said they were following crucial leads to arrest those involved. The area is a NASA stronghold and during the October 26 repeat polls, less than 3,000 people voted in the area. Savula said he would visit the constituency to calm down the situation and urge communities to continue living in peace and harmony. “I have received calls from so many people who are worried but we will deal with the situation to ensure no one is harmed or is forced to leave Lugari because of politics”, said Savula.
