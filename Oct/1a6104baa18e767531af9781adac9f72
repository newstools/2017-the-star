Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu has urged Jubilee supporters not to heed to opposition leader Raila Odinga’s call not to vote. He urged residents to turn out in numbers to vote for President Uhuru Kenyatta. Speaking in Kiambu town on Monday, when he met the Jubilee Women’s Brigade and its followers, Waititu said Raila is trying to trick people into failing to vote. “We know the tricks being used by the NASA fraternity, but we have been assured of security so I urge you to come out and vote and make sure that President Uhuru wins with more than nine million votes,” he said. Waititu told those registered as voters and later transferred to different polling stations without their consent to notify their MCA so arrangements are made to ferry them to the polling station. “We must give UhuRuto a clear win,” he said.  Senator Kimani Wamatangi, who was present, said tomorrow’s election will take place and no court can overturn the decision. He urged Jubilee supporters sto come out in large numbers to make sure Uhuru stays in office. “Just to clarify for any doubting Thomases. October 26, 2017 is when the real dialogue will take place, and will involve all Kenyans at the polling stations,” he said. Jubilee Women’s Brigade leader Rachael Shebesh, accompanied by women leaders from other counties, called on supporters to come out in large numbers and vote. “It is through your votes that we will make Uhuru sit comfortably as the President of this country. You must accept to come out 100 per cent to vote for him. Let us all wake each other up on the 26th and make sure every eligible voter votes in this region,”she said . Kiambu woman representative Gathoni Wamuchomba said the presidency will not be negotiated.
