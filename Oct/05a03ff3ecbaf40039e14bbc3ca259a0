Before the Kansoul happened, the group entered the music scene individually with their separate identities and styles. Apart, their music had been hailed as a significant milestone in the industry. Mejja thrived on his genge rap hijinks, while KidKora and Madtraxx prospered on the burgeoning demand for cheery, contemporary urban hits. After releasing tracks like Twenzetu and Double Tap, they came to the realisation that perhaps it would be more profitable if they continued to work together. Did it work? Well, what we know is that they've been having the time of their lives, giving all other top pop artistes in the country a run for their money.  The group came together seeking musical identity, a mission that is expected propel their careers to greater heights. Theyâ€™ve pierced out of their cocoons to deliver hit after hit. With hits such as Bablas, No Woman No Party, Moto wa Kuotea Mbali and Nyongwa, we can confirm that their consistency has been steady. Of late, the trio has been featured on the line-up of a good number of top concert shows, and they're certainly delivering powerful live displays. When Nigerian artiste Tekno was unable to provide his Nairobian fanbase with a worthwhile show, The Kansoul were among the few acts who did justice to their set. They know what it takes to work a crowd. The group has had a profound impact on the direction of music in Kenya. They have been releasing tracks â€”ranging from chilled tunes to the boisterous hits â€” that tell our nationâ€™s resolute desire to want to drop our guard just to have a good time.  Critics might look at the group's music as the kind that lacks a dash of intricacy or depth, but, in The Kansoul's defence, it could solely be based on their intention simply to provide enjoyment without even forcing it. In the process, they are appealing to the pop culture, and their music is constantly playing on radio and in the clubs, and maybe that's all that matters.
