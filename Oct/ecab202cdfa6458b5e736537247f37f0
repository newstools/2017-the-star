Governors and MPs in the Rift Valley have warned NASA leader Raila Odinga against calling for an economic boycott and civil disobedience to press for fresh elections Governors Jackson Mandago of Uasin Gishu and Stephen Sang of Nandi separately said on Sunday NASA’s plan for a National Resistance Movement was illegal and unworkable. “Our regions and economic sectors and communities rely on each other and it’s unworkable for NASA to think of an economic boycott and sabotage, as if their supporters are self reliant. Kenya is one and such a scheme cannot work," Mandago said in Eldoret. He said Odinga’s plan for civil disobedience would also cause suffering to innocent Kenyans, as their leaders always protect themselves during riots and demonstrations. “The aim of NRM is to cause violence and chaos but that is not acceptable," He said
