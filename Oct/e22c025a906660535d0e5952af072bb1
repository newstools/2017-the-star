Police in Bunyala on Thursday had difficulty dispersing rowdy youths who had blocked Ruambwa Bridge. They were protesting against the IEBC for holding a repeat presidential election without satisfying NASA’s “irreducible minimum” demands. Business at Harambee trading centre at the border of Siaya and Budalang’i was disrupted as the youths chanted, “Election without Raila is no election. They have stolen Baba’s votes”. Motorists plying the highway to and from Busia and Siaya had to detour to avoid violence. The protesting youth accused IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati of declining to heed NASA leader Raila Odinga and carry out reforms at the commission. “Today’s [Thursday] repeat presidential election will not be free and fair, because the irregularities the Supreme Court judges had identified during the nullification of the August election have not been rectified,” the youths said in a statement.  They also praised the opposition chief for transforming NASA into a national resistance movement. They said they will continue to resist anybody trying to violating their constitutional rights.
