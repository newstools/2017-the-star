The Kenya Defence Forces medical personnel have treated 1, 236 malaria patients including 426 children in Baringo and Turkana counties. KDF deployed its team of medical officers to the two counties following an outbreak of the disease. The medical officers have been traversing across the counties to reach affected residents in far-flung areas. They have been providing medical care to the ailing residents in the local health facilities.  KDF spokesman Colonel David Obonyo said the medical assistance operation was complemented by the county governments and other humanitarian agencies. "Medical assistance is part of KDF secondary constitutional mandate which is to support the civil administration to mitigate such crisis in the country," Obonyo said yesterday. The troops also set up medical camps where there were none. The military also sent another team of medical officers to Isiolo earlier this month ahead of the commemoration of KDF day which was held on October 14 in the county. More than 917 patients suffering from different conditions were also treated. Obonyo said all those who were affected received medical care and the health crisis has been contained.  Residents in the two counties were suffering unattended to due to the prolonged nurses' strike. "KDF remains ready to assist whenever similar problems arise as part of that mandate to ensure that Kenyans are secure from any threat." Tiaty sub-county was the most affected after the outbreak on September 28. More than 2000 had contracted the disease. The pandemic had claimed 15 lives before KDF's intervention.
