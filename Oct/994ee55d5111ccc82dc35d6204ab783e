Master Robert Nyamongo has withdrawn from Mashujaa Day team shooting competition set for Saturday at the National Gun Owners Association’s Kirigiti Range in Kiambu County. The 2017 Africa International Defensive Pistol Association champion pulled out to allow all teams to have a level playground. He, will, however serve as a full-time safety officer at the competition. Being the top handgun firer and the only ‘Master’ in the country, Nyamongo’s team would have had an upper hand over the rest who do not have shooters in his classification. “The event is meant to encourage many shooters and gun owners to compete. So, when you have one advanced shooter in a team, then it becomes unfair to other lineups who do not have a Master. All teams have to begin on a level playground,” noted Nyamongo who belongs to the Glock Team. He donated the trophy he won two weeks at the South Africa DPA Southern National championships for the Mashujaa Day shoot. Nyamongo is toying with the idea of becoming a full-time trainer and arbitrator locally while competing at the international level only. This is after he went through an intensive scientific ‘Training of Trainers’ course in South Africa. “I surrendered the trophy to motivate other shooters. It is good to encourage and build the sport,” added Nyamongo. Aviator Alex Migwi, the secretary general of NGAO-Kenya, strictly invited all licensed gun owners- from all clubs and non affiliated legal firearm holders- to enroll for the competition and training too.
