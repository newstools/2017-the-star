A meeting between nursesâ€™ union officials and the Mombasa county government failed to bear fruit on Wednesday. Governor Hassan Joho and Deputy Governor William Kingi met the nurses in a 7-hour closed-door meeting. Kenya National Union of Nurses acting national chairman Joseph Ngwasi led a demonstration of nurses in Mombasa streets before seeking audience with Joho. However, after the meeting, the nurses came out dejected. The said the strike is still on. Ngwasi said they asked Joho to talk to his counterparts. They want their issues addressed for them to end the four-month long strike. â€œWe are now calling for a round-table meeting between nursesâ€™ union, county governments and the national government to resolve the pending issues before thinking about a return-to-work formula,â€ he said. According to the Council of Governors, nurses from at least 24 counties have returned to work. Ngwasi said the signing of the CBA is the nursesâ€™ irreducible minimum. â€œThe only issue we want addressed is the CBA. We cannot be coerced to return to work. Our strike is not controlled by a button, which you can switch on or off,â€ he said. However, the deputy governor thinks the talks went well.  â€œWe had fruitful discussions with the nursesâ€™ official. The governor has promised to talk to his colleagues,â€ Kingi said.  â€œYou have tasked him [Joho] to talk with other governors. We are requesting for time to engage them to come up with an amicable solution,â€ he said.  Joho flew to Nairobi to Nairobi after the meeting.  â€œWe are happy the nurses have reduced their demands to only three. We believe a solution will be found,â€ Kingi said.
