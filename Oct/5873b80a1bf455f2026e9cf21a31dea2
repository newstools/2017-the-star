At least 35,664 polling stations were opened for the repeat presidential election on Thursday, IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati has said. He said the stations, representing 87 per cent of those opened, sent a message indicating that the election went on. "Some 5,319 polling stations did not send an opening message," Chebukati said adding that 50 constituencies had all the polling stations opened at 100 per cent. "We have received 27,124 forms34A, which is 80 per cent of the polling stations," he added. The IEBC boss said the turnout stood at 48 per cent by 5 pm when the stations were closed to pave way for counting. The 5,319 polling stations that did not open are spread across the country, the chairman said in the commission's briefing after voting was closed. Earlier, Chebukati said elections in Nyanza counties namely Kisumu, Siaya, Homa Bay, and Migori will be held on Saturday. This was after residents blocked roads to polling stations hence making it impossible for the commission to deliver poll materials. "We continue to face security challenges. There will be a repeat in elections in those areas as provided in the constitution," Chebukati told the media in the commission's first update on Thursday.
