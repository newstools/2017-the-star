Seven people were on Saturday arrested in connection with the looting at Tumaini Supermarket in Kisumu on Friday. The suspects are also accused of destroying property worth millions of shillings and smashing the stores' windows during the anti - IEBC protests.  The suspected NASA supporters broke into Tumaini Supermarket and stole items including food from the eatery. They also assaulted workers who tried to stop them and injured some of them. However, NASA distanced its supporters from the act saying the criminals were not their followers. Police were forced to lob teargas canisters and shoot in the air to disperse them.

"The deliberate and conspicuous absence of the police as this incident happened points to an unacceptable complicity and choreography for which the local police leadership must come out clean," the statement from ODM read. Ong'wen asked the police to investigate the incident, adding that police should protect property. "This is more critical than their obsession with throwing tear gas and meting ruthless brutality on innocent and law-abiding citizens," he added.
