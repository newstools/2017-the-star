The government and an NGO have mapped out regions prone to election violence in Baringo and Nakuru counties. The government and Jamii Thabiti have identified Tiaty in Baringo as the most vulnerable because of frequent cattle rustling and banditry. Jamii Thabiti director Peter Waweru said Nakuruâ€™s hotspots are Naivasha, Gilgil, Molo, Nakuru West and Nakuru East. â€œIn the identified areas, we are working with the government to empower peace monitors and members of the Nyumba Kumi,â€ he said in Naivasha yesterday. Besides Tiaty, Baringo has Eldama Ravine, Kabarnet and Nginyan. Naivasha subcounty commissioner Isaac Masinde (pictured) welcomed the peace programmes. Waweru, who is in charge of community policing forums, said the peace forums in the regions are crucial ahead of the October 26 presidential rerun. The initiative is meant to ensure peaceful electioneering, especially in Nakuru, which was one of the hardest-hit counties during the 2007-08 post-election violence. â€œJamii Thabiti has been organising community policing forums in Nakuru and Baringo in the wake of the upcoming presidential election,â€ Waweru said, adding that police, chiefs and members of the Nyumba Kumi Initiative have played a crucial role in promoting peace, but they need to be empowered more. â€œThe community policing committees, peace committees, elders, Nyumba Kumi members, chiefs and police are doing their best to prevent violence.â€
