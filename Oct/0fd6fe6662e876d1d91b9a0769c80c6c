Teachers, pupils and education officials have assured they are ready for the KCPE exam that starts today. In Nyandarua county, 19,505 pupils will sit the exam. Nyandarua Central has 1,921 pupils across 50 examination centres. Nyandarua Central subcounty director of education James Wahome yesterday expressed optimism that the pupils will perform well. They are adequately prepared and the problems faced in the previous year were resolved, he said. “Supervisors and invigilators are well prepared. The national and county governments have made available vehicles to ferry papers. Every centre will be manned by two security officers,” Wahome said He said teachers “covered the whole syllabus and he expects high performance, as there has been enough time for revision. I’m very optimistic this time things will be better.” John Muinami, the headteacher at AC Primary School, Olkalou, said they have prepared the pupils well, although “our preparations were slightly undermined by the concluded elections, given this examination centre was a polling centre.” He said the school has been “growing from strength to strength”. It has 78 candidates.
