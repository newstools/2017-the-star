Suspicion is high following the death of a 66-year-old retired teacher in Tigania East. Residents have said police officers travelling with Joseph Mberia may be responsible for his death. Mberia was picked up by police on Sunday evening to record a statement of how suspected Turkana bandits invaded and attacked him. "When the deceased went to the police station, he told them he had been attacked. The officers instructed him to leave the area and seek refuge in a safer place," one resident told journalists on Monday. "It was about 4pm and Mberia was abord the police vehicle. It is not clear how he fell down from the vehicle where he was crushed to death," the resident added. Area DCIO Benson Omondi said they are looking into the incident. He said Mberia was alighting form the moving vehicle before they arrived at Muhara police station where he fell and died. "He succumbed to injuries after he tried to alight from moving vehicle ... We will talk to eye witnesses, police involved and the hospital where he was receiving treatment to know what led to his death," Omondi said. Lanyiruu assistant chief Japheth Mwenda said the deceased may have jumped from a moving police vehicle. The body was taken to Tigania mission hospital mortuary.
