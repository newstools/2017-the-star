Kenya Airports Authority has licensed Silverstone air to fly the Kisumu-Kwale route, stepping up competition for established carriers. The company will fly a modern fleet of up to 50 passengers from Wilson Airport twice daily. Managing director Mohamed Sumoh said their fleet will boost business activities by opening up markets for investors, including those in the tourism sector. "Our target market is of tourists and business people who want to fly from Kwale to Kisumu for a day and still have ample time to catch the return flight home," he said in a speech read by his representative David Odhiambo. Sumoh said a one-way ticket from the two destinations will cost a minimum of Sh4,500, including taxes. He added they are embarking on an expansion strategy that will include  Malindi, Lamu, Marsabit and Moyale. "We are ready and happy to serve you and you are welcome to travel with us. We are looking forward to exposing ourselves fully to competition to make us a stronger and better airline." Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya thanked the Silverstone team for choosing Kwale as a destination, saying this will increase the number of tourists to the area. Mvurya urged locals to support the airline by traveling to Nairobi or Kisumu as the tickets are affordable. "The addition of Silverstone is definitely going to increase the number of tourists visiting Ukunda. [There will be many benefits for residents]." Mvurya urged tourists to visit Diani beach in large numbers, terming it the best destination in Africa. "Now that you can cheaply travel from other parts of Kenya to Diani, it's upon you to come and have fun and enjoy the hospitality of our people."
