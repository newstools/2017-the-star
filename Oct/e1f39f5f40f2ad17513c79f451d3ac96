Youths yesterday attempted to block voting from taking place in Shinyalu constituency. They engaged police in running battles in Khayega Township and barricaded the Kakamega-Kisumu and Khayega-Shinyalu roads. Police fired teargas and shot in the air to disperse them. They retreated, regrouped and confronted the officers. Trouble began when two voters entered Khayega polling station to vote at around 10.30am. One was confronted by the youths who reprimanded him before the officers intervened. The youth quickly gathered and engaged the police for more than two hours. Western Regional police commander Moses Ombati later talked to the youths before they calmed down.  They remained at the market chanting no-election slogans. From then, voting did not take place at the station, as the few voters coming to the centre got scared and stayed away. Police arrested several people, who had blocked the Kakamega-Kisumu highway at Amalemba. The youths had gathered and were ready to storm the PAG polling station, when the officers arrived. “We have arrested many of them — not one, not two. Allow us to finish the operation then we can brief you on what we have done,” Tito Kilonzi, the Kakamega county police commander, said. Voting continued at the centre, but there was a poor turnout. Many polling stations were empty.
