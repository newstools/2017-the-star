South Africa based retailer ShopRite Holdings is expected to fill retail space left empty by the struggling Nakumatt Holdings chain, Bloomberg reported yesterday. This follows reports by the troubled retailer on its plans to shut down more branches if their merger with Tuskys Supermarkets goes through. According to Bloomberg, ShopRite Holdings is currently in talks with some of the mall owners with the aim of opening their first store in the country. “We are currently in talks with some of the property owners but nothing has been signed,” Shoprite director Gerhard Fritz told Bloomberg. Fritz added that they are also waiting for the outcome of the ongoing merger talks between Nakumatt and local rival Tusker Mattresses, commonly known as Tuskys, before deciding whether to proceed. “Taking over vacated outlets would be the preferred way for the Cape Town-based company to enter East Africa’s largest economy as the retail market there is “too well established” to build new stores,” said Fritz, who runs ShopRite’s African operations outside its home market. In the recent past, France-based Carrefour Supermarket announced plans to replace Nakumatt space at Thika Road Mall while Souk Supermarket already replaced the retailer space at NextGen Mall along Mombasa road.
