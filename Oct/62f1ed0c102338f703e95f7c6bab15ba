The government has ordered owners of bars, video halls, pool games and clubs in Eldoret to close down by 11 pm daily as part of security measures ahead of Thursday's repeat presidential elections. Uasin Gishu County Commissioner Abdi Hassan said criminal activities would not be allowed during the election period. He said the right of those who will vote and those planning to boycott the elections will be respected and protected Speaking during Mashujaa day celebrations in Eldoret Hassan said boda-boda operators will also not be allowed to operate after 11 pm. He said most of them are used by criminals at night. “We are issuing a stern warning to those who may be thinking that they will interfere with polling stations, let them try and they will know that the government is in place. They will be dealt with ruthlessly,” Hassan said. He said those who don’t want to vote on October 26 should keep off. “Maybe buy newspapers and stay at home or listen to radio but do not be cheated to come out and try to interfere with the polls,” said Hassan Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago who was present claimed that some bus companies were being used to ferry youth to Nairobi, Mombasa and other parts of the country to disrupt the polls. “We will shut down such companies whose owners are contributing to insecurity in the country,” Mandago said. He said the country had used more than Sh 15 Billion in the repeat elections and it unacceptable to have the exercise interfered with by those interested in chaos. “That money would have been used on building roads or paying farmers better prices for their maize,” Mandago said. He said the country had been politicking for more than one year and the same trend cannot be allowed to go beyond October 26.
