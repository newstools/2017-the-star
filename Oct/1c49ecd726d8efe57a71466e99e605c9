Kajiado county commissioner Harsama Kello (pictured) has been moved to the Office of the President in Nairobi. He was abruptly moved to Nairobi and his position handed over to his Isinya deputy county commissioner David Kipkemei in an acting capacity. Kello confirmed the transfer and said it had nothing to do with his war of words with a local opposition MP. It was not immediately clear what position Kello will take at the OP when he reports to his new duty post today. But sources said he will take up a director’s position. Kello has served in Kajiado for close to 20 years as a district commissioner, a deputy county commissioner and a county commissioner. Kello yesterday said his transfer is “routine”.
