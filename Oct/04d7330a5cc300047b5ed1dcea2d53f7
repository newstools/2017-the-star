Anti-riot police fired teargas on Tuesday to disperse rioting matatu operators protesting against the stoning of two of their vehicles. The vehicles had their windows smashed by unknown persons at Awasi trading center in Kisumu county. Some passengers in the vehicles owned by Wareng Sacco sustained slight injuries during the 9am incident. Kericho base commander Michael Kahare and Kericho OCS Abduraham Mohamed had a hard time trying to clear the busy Kericho-Kisumu highway. Youths in Kericho town barricaded the road in protest against what happened at Awasi. They were heard warning that they would flush out members of a certain community from the town if Jubilee and NASA's political differences are not dealt with. Most matatu operators plying the Awasi-Nandi Hills route to Eldoret opted to use the Total-Molo-Londiani route for fear of attacks. Shop owners at Ndege Chai Plaza closed their doors during the altercation. Kericho has been tense for some days after a man was shot with arrows following poll clashes at its border with Kisumu county. Governors Paul Chepkwony and his Kisumu counterpart Anyang' Nyong'o conducted joint peace campaigns in the county at the weekend.
