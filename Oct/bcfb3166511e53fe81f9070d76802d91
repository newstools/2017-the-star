There were desperate scenes of rescuers using their bare
hands to rescue people trapped in the rubble after the collapse of a
five-storey building on the Mwembe Estate, Kisii county, on Wednesday. Seven people died and a team of Kenya Defence Forces Disaster
Response Unit arrived at the scene in the evening. The rescue took most of the night, ending at 4.30am. Where is the NDMU’s equipment? When the Israelis sent rescue
teams to Nairobi in 2006, following the collapse of a five-storey building in
which 14 people died, Kenyans marvelled at the skills and equipment of the
Israeli Defence Forces’ team.  The highly trained team of the IDF’s Home Front
Command came complete with a medical team and state-of-the-art rescue equipment
and sniffer dogs and pulled out survivors and bodies. Kenya’s NDMU needs to be composed of a multiagency team of
military, police and medics. It also needs regional depots prepared to deal
with mudslides, floods, fires and earthquakes.
