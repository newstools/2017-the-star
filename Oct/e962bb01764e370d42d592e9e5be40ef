Four students and a security guard killed during an attack at Lokichogio AIC Secondary School were laid to rest on Saturday. Turkana Governor Josephat Nanok condemned the incident as well as police for laxity. "In my first term as governor we saw the gap in the security sector and allocated money to pay the NPRs for three consecutive financial years but were never allowed to carry on. I hope this incident revives this issue," he said. Nanok asked police and UNCHR to investigate Kakuma refugee camp for illegal arms and undocumented refugees. He also called for a review of the security situation in the region. Those laid to rest were Paterson Naweek, Joseph Emoni, Emmanuel Eka, Ipua Halloran and Peter Lojiem. Senator Malachy Ekla asked UNCHR to compensate the families of those killed and called for better management of refugees. Turkana West MP Epuyo Nanok said corruption
within the police force allowed illicit arms to be brought into the county. He questioned how the attacker travelled
from Lokichogio to Kakuma with a gun without police detection, despite several roadblocks on the way.  Turkana Central MP John Lodepe asked counties where insecurity was rife to jointly push for the devolution of security.  Turkana South MP James Lomenen said refugees should only be admitted to schools within the camps. Seven people were killed by suspected Toposa militia during the gun attack on October 14. Turkana West OCPD David Nyabuto said security has been increased and
that they were working with South Sudan authorities to arrest the
attackers. Read: Turkana school closed indefinitely after seven killed
