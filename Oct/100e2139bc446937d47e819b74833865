A total of 21,570 standard eight candidates will sit this year’s KCPE exam in Mombasa county. Of these, 12,791 are boys and 8,777 are girls. Speaking to the Star in Mombasa town yesterday, county director of education James Kairu said all examination materials had been received. All 92 public and 300 private primary schools did their rehearsals. Kairu said all loopholes have been sealed to avert cheating. A total of 6,278 form four candidates will sit the KCSE examination starting on November 6. Of these, 3,902 are boys and 2,886 are girls. KCSE practicals and oral exams are ongoing. “We have not heard any cases of cheating and we are hopeful we will finish administering both KCPE and KCSE examinations without any issues,” Kairu said. Prisoners are also among those expected to sit both KCPE and KCSE examinations. Last year, the Aga Khan Academy produced the two best candidates in Mombasa. Muhammad Awadhan and Zainab Zeinuddin got 422 and 415 marks respectively. Yesterday, Aga Khan Academy head teacher Christopher Owino said teachers have prepared students well and their expectations are high. “We want to surpass last year’s performance. We are competing against our results last year,” he said. Owino said Aga Khan has established itself as a high performer and the school wants to keep it that way. The exams come at a time when the 8-4-4 education system is set to be replaced by the 2-6-3-3-3 procedure. The new system places emphasis on continuous assessment tests rather than one-off examinations. Education experts have said 8-4-4 is too examination-oriented.
