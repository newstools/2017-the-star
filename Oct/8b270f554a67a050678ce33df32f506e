Busia schools St. Monica Chakol Girls and St. Benedict Boys, Budalangi want the Tennis Kenya to start county tennis league to cater for school leavers. The need to start tennis leagues in counties follows reports that out of 10 richest female athletes in the world, seven are tennis players with Serena Williams leading with a net worth of Sh16.6 billion. Russian-born Maria Sharapova is second with Sh14b. Others in the top ten are—Venus Williams, Anna Kournikova, Li Na, Martina Hingis and Agnieszka Radwanska. St Monica, Chakol coach Deo Ojiambo, who is ranked top in the county, said tennis is one of the world’s richest paying sport but has only been left to schools with no single organised league. “TK only waits for international fixtures before rushing to pick players. We have good players who abandon their tennis careers after leaving school or joining universities that don’t offer tennis as an extra-curriculum activity,” he said.  “ When Serena Williams toured Kenya in November 2008, she was so passionate about the game but regretted that there is no league in Kenya to nurture talent. That is the scenario we are encountering in our bid to produce world beaters,” he said. Ojiambo said schools in Busia lack good pitches, forcing them to play on grass or murram. St. Benedict, Budalangi Principal John Juma said his school has produced good tennis players despite lack of equipment. He urged TK to start tennis leagues in the country to nurture talents that abound in the game.
