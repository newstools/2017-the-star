President Uhuru Kenyatta should stop setting a bad precedent for future generations by changing laws for personal interests, Gem Elisha Odhiambo said yesterday. He said elections are not won by laws but by votes. Odhiambo said despite Uhuruâ€™s efforts to mutilate the election laws, NASA chief Raila Odinga will still beat him on October 26. â€œIts unfortunate the Jubilee administration has no development record to attract votes and that is why they have resorted in changing the laws to swear in Uhuru through the back door,â€ he said. Addressing the press, Odhiambo told Jubilee leaders to sober up as Kenya is bigger than any one individual. He said a referee cannot change the rules of the game at half-time.
