Kenya Airways has been named Africa’s leading airline for the second time in a row at the annual World Travel Awards. KQ was also named Africa’s leading airline in its business class offering for the fifth consecutive year. The national carrier beat nominees including Rwanda Air, Egypt Air, Royal Air Maroc and South African Airways. "Winning these awards would not have been possible without the passion and dedication of the Kenya Airways team and the strong support from our guests," KQ chief executive Sebastian Mikosz said on Tuesday evening. "Our guests are at the heart of everything we do and these two awards confirm our undeterred commitment to them." The ceremony was held at the Radisson Blu Hotel and Conference Centre in Kigali, Rwanda. On September 22, Kenya Airways said it had met over 70 per cent of the more than 100 checklists ahead of its maiden trip to the US next year. Mikosz said they were negotiating a revenue sharing plan with key partner airlines in Europe and USA. The carrier also reported finalising the deal to convert its Sh50.2 billion debt into equity as part of its financial recovery plan. Chairman Michael Joseph hinted the arrangement would see the government increase its stake to 46.5 per cent, up from the current 29.8 per cent, while 11 banks will replace KLM as second largest shareholders at 35.7 per cent.
