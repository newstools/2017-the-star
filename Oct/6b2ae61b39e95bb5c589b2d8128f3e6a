At least 600 squatters from Umoja Estate in Thika yesterday protested against alleged grabbing of their 100 acres by a private developer. A tycoon erected a signboard and warned them of dire consequences if they trespassed on the land. Led by their chairman Peter Njoroge, the angry squatters claimed the land was allocated to them by the defunct Thika Municipal Council in 1996 on the orders of former President Daniel Moi. â€œThis is our land and we wonâ€™t allow greedy people to evict us. Crooked officials in government and the former county government colluded with some tycoons to evict us,â€ Njoroge said.  â€œIn 2010, our land was sold to a private developer who has been terrorising us. He used police to forcibly evict us. On January 9, 2014 earthmovers flattened our houses. Weâ€™ve been living on a road reserve,â€ the chairman said.  Beatrice Wambui, 85, claimed she lost her husband, Karanja Kibiri, after a land tussle. He tripped and fell. Wambui said he died of his injuries months later.  The squatters have appealed to the National Land Commission to resolve the matter urgently.
