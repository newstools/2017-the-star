I have spoken to [Royal Media CEO] Wachira Waruru and apologised to him," he said. He spoke at Okoa Kenya offices where he also addressed IEBC's declaration that President Uhuru Kenyatta won the repeat October 26 election. In a statement, Information CS Joe Mucheru said the government "takes great exception with the unwarranted attack" as the journalists were doing the jobs. "The constitution guarantees the media freedom to exercise their right under article 34. It is therefore unacceptable that NASA supporters went out of their way to contravene this constitutional provision," he noted. "As Cabinet Secretary responsible for the media sector, I condemn this act and assure the media that the government will continue to ensure their right to perform their duties, in accordance with the law, is protected." Mucheru said the ICT and Interior ministries will investigate the incident and ensure the perpetrators are punished.
