Biashara Sacco has made profit despite the effect of interest rates capping by the Central Bank of Kenya. The sacco made Sh72 million profit since the beginning of the year, surpassing the target of Sh57 million. Chairman Joseph Njamuku (pictured) said, “If we were giving dividends today, then we would have given at the rate of 10 per cent on deposit and 16 per cent dividend on shares.” He said capping of interest rates led to more members joining the sacco after failing to secure loans from commercial banks. Jamuku said the sacco had to borrow money to meet the needs of the increased number of members. He spoke during the sacco’s Special General Meeting held at YMCA Hall, Nyeri town, on Monday. The sacco plans to open a branch in Nairobi next year.
