Detectives in Mwingi, led by DCIO Simon Mongera, raided Mwingi Central MP Gideon Mulyungi’s home on Friday. He is accused of making defamatory statements in Kalundu market, Kitui town.  Mulyungi went missing after he was summoned to record a statement over the defamatory claims he made about the President last week in Kitui during the Kamba declaration.  “We want to make sure we see him. We went to search his house and he is not here. We have only found his housegirl and mother,” Mongera said. Mulyungi has been in the hiding since Sunday after his defamatory statement on Saturday.  “The search still continues,” Mongera said. The housegirl told the press Mulyungi left the keys to the house with the police.  “I even told the police that Mulyungi is too senior a person to stoop to the level of hiding under the bed. I cannot hide under a bed either. He is not in the house at all. I have not seen him since Saturday,” she said. Mulyungi allegedly said, “Uhuru is not superman and I think we are equal where it matters as men......”  Mwende Salu, a diehard supporter of Mulyungi, said Mwingi Central residents want their MP to remain in good health so the police should stop intimidating him.  Turnout in Kambaland was low during Thursday’s repeat polls.
