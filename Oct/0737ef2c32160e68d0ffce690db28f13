Health Cabinet Secretary Cleopa Mailu has said the government is firmly behind the move by the Council of Governors to hire new nurses. He spoke in Mombasa Tuesday during the annual general meeting of the Catholic Health Commission of Kenya. Mailu said the risk and uniform allowances demanded by nurses are not issues that should subject Kenyans to torture. â€œWe are calling upon them to resume duty. If the obey the court order we will begin negotiations,â€ he said.  Mailu said the burden on the Exchequer will be huge if nurses and clinical officers demands are met. The CS said the nurses strike started in the middle of a financial year, and resources had already been allocated.  We are appealing to the nurses to obey the court order because we all must live within the law and then get back to the table and agree on what is feasible, spread over four years,â€ he said.  Mailu said the clinicians; strike was preemptive of Salaries and Remuneration Commission and has no merit. He said SRC had not made itâ€™s stand on job grading before the strike.
