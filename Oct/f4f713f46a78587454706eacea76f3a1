A man has been declared missing following the collapse of a four-storey building in Nakuru on Sunday. Peter Kaguthi, a casual worker, was believed to be trapped under the rubble. He had been reported missing by his family members, who informed Red Cross officials at the site of the collapsed building. A combined team of rescuers drawn from the KDF, Nakuru county fire brigade and the National Disaster Management Unit continued to clear the debris as the operation entered its fifth day yesterday. Frequent pauses to allow recovery of propertyhas prolonged the operation, rescuers said. Deputy communication director at NDMU Pius Masai said they were doing everything possible to trace the missing person. He said their rescue operation was 80 per cent done. “We hope to be done with the remaining 20 per cent so that we can hand over this site to the Nakuru county disaster management unit,” Masai said.
