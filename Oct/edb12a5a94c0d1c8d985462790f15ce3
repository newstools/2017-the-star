A Kakamega community based organisation is educating teachers and religious leaders on safe abortion. The campaign is meant to reduce the number of deaths and permanent complications that result from unsafe abortions performed by untrained people. Bumulusi CBO chairperson Pamela Wambongo said the organisation targets teachers, religious leaders, chiefs and their assistants, youths and women’s groups because they have large audiences. “This programme seeks to rescue young girls, married and single women who end up seeking services of unqualified herbalists to terminate unwanted pregnancies,” she said. Wambongo said many premature deaths or permanent reproductive complications happen as a result of unsafe abortions. Wambogo said an average of four women seek advice from the CBO monthly. Bumulusi is among several other CBOs supported by NGO IPAS Alliance Africa. Wambongo spoke during a meeting with religious leaders at Namirama Friends Church on Monday. Debate is rages on whether abortion should be legalised or not. Article 26 (2) of the Constitution states that life begins at conception. Sub-section (4) states that abortion is not permitted unless, in the opinion of a trained health professional, there is need for emergency treatment, or the life or health of the mother is in danger, or if permitted by any other law. Wambongo said most of those who end up procuring unsafe abortions are schoolgirls, married couples who conceive out of wedlock, rape victims and those who conceive after incestuous relationships.
