Insurance companies are leaning more towards high-yield investment options to increase their revenues since premiums are no longer profitable, analysts at Cytonn Investment say. “Earnings from underwriters core business is not profitable, which is why they have to move to rely more and more on investment income,” Cytonn Investment analyst Caleb Mugendi said. A report by the firm on the insurance industry shows that underwriters are shifting to real estate and asset management as a source of revenue from government securities and the equity market. Mugendi said that compared to the fixed income market, high-yield asset classes have proven to be more stable. “The fixed income market currently isn’t yielding that much - about 10 per cent yield on government paper - and equity prices fluctuate in a volatile manner, leading to a decline in earnings,” Mugendi said. “The high-yield asset classes gain higher returns as they are significantly more stable.” An industry report by the Insurance Regulatory Authority shows that at least 80.4 per cent of insurers’ profits are held in income-generating investments. Half-year data shows that the industry asset base grew 12.92 per cent, or Sh58.76 billion, to Sh513.7 billion, compared to Sh454.94 billion recorded last year. Investments also increased 12.89 per cent to Sh410.36 billion, from Sh363.49 billion. The general business class accounted for at least 64.21 and 71.36 per cent of the insurance industry’s total asset base and investments, respectively. Cytonn analysts said that gains from premiums were as a result of high management costs, high claims and slow uptake of innovation in the insurance industry. “There are a few insurance companies that have mobile applications where you can look at your premiums. However looking at innovation, there is still a long way to go. Technology can save a lot of distribution costs, administration expenses and the like,” Mugendi said. Management expenses grew by 10.6 per cent to Sh20.03 billion during the January-June period compared to Sh18.12 billion reported in the first half of 2016. Claims incurred by general insurers were Sh28.63 billion in the second quarter of 2017, an increase of 6.5 per cent compared to Sh26.88 billion incurred the previous year. According to the 2016 industry report by IRA, fraud continues to riddle the insurance sector, with the claim rate growing 11.8 per cent to Sh54.86 billion from Sh49.05 billion in 2015. Medical and motor business classes cumulatively accounted for 83.5 per cent of total claims in the general insurance business, with each accounting for 33 and 50.5 per cent respectively.
