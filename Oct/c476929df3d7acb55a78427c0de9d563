Three gangsters shot dead by the Recce Squad in Kenol, Murang’a on Saturday had killed five officers in the last three months and stolen three guns, police have said. An AK 47 rifle stolen from two officers killed in Kibichoi in September and a pistol stolen from two others shot dead in Kayole on Saturday morning were recovered in a house the men lived in. In a record three minutes, the recce squad killed the hoodlums who are also accused of stealing from M-Pesa shops in Thika and Juja estates. The suspects, aged between 18 and 25, were shot dead inside the house they had rented for the last one month. They had engaged the police in a five -hour-shoot out. A couple and their five-month-old baby, whom the thugs were using as human shield, were rescued by the officers. Members of the public, who had thronged the scene of the shooting, praised the recce officers. Nairobi DCI chief Ireri Kamwende said police recovered a police appointment certificate and a pistol snatched from one of the officers murdered by the gang in Kayole. The gang, who lived in Kenol, used a motorbike. They specialised in killing police and stealing guns. Kamwende said they were part of the infamous Kayole Gaza group, which killed an officer outside his bar in Kayole in August. A pistol snatched from the deceased is yet to be found. Yesterday, director of DCI Muhoro Ndegwa in a message to officers from the Flying Squad and Special Crime Prevention Unit involved in the planning of the raid said, ”Nobody kills a police officer and gets away with it.” The gang had in early October escaped a police dragnet in Thika. They are reported to have escaped after being tipped-off. Last evening, police intensified the search for a second pistol stolen from the two police officers killed in Kayole.
