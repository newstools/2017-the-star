Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang’ula has told Jubilee to stop chest-thumping. He was addressing mourners on Saturday at Madisi village in Kabuchai constituency.  The burial was for Bungoma woman representative Catherine Wambilianga’s of 90-year-old uncle Mzee Francis Wafula. The leaders asked President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto to have dialogue with NASA leaders to end the protests in the country. The Bungoma Senator said the country belongs to all Kenyans and not a few individuals. Exclusion will only deepen the crisis, he said. Jubilee is inflating figures by adding and robbing for themselves in the repeat presidential poll last Thursday, Wetang’ula said. He said Kenyans want peace and not loss of lives of innocent protesters and destruction of property. Wetang’ula accused the police of using live bullets against Bungoma anti-election protesters. He said he was surprised some of the anti-riot police had dreadlocks. He suspects the outlawed Mungiki were brought to Bungoma to kill protesters. “We are asking acting Interior CS Fred Matiang’i and Bungoma county commissioner Joshua Chepchieng to tell residents where the deadlocked people, who were dispersed protesters on Friday, came from,” he said. Wetang’ula said in his entire life, he has never seen police with rastas.  He thanked Bungoma residents for heeding NASA’s call to shun the poll.  Bungoma Governor Wafula Wangamati castigated Senate Speaker Ken Lusaka for saying the man identified as Baraza, who was shot, was not from Bungoma. He said such reckless statements will only deepen the crisis.  Wambilianga urged police to stop using live bullets on unarmed protesters. Kabuchai MP James Mukwe Lusweti also attended the burial.
