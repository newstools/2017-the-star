A Nakuru court is awaiting Chief Justice David Maragaâ€™s guidance before it proceeds with a case challenging construction of the Sh34 billion Itare Dam. Kipsigis elders and those from other communities have petitioned the court to prevent construction, saying it will hurt their livelhoods and the environment. Justice Dalmas Ohungo of the Land and Environment court told parties to the case that they are waiting for the CJ to give directions. He had initially ordered that files be placed before the CJ who is expected to constitute a bench to hear the case. Councils of Elders from Kipsigis, Luo, Kuria, Abagusii and Ogiek communities moved to court seeking an injunction. Through lawyer Gordon Ogola, the elders said the case raises weighty and complex issues that cannot be handled by a single judge. â€œThe sensitivity of and public interest in this case is overwhelming for this court,â€ Ogola said. An estimated 10 million people in nine counties will be affected.  Ogola said the court must interpret public participation and to what extent it is required in environmental matters. It will also interpret the Water Act of 2016 as well as an alleged conflict between the Act and another of 2015. The elders also argued construction of the dam does not comply with the international water convention on climate change. They said this matter would be too much for a single judge to handle. But defense lawyer Bernard Akungo representing the Rift Valley Water Services Board urged the judge to proceed with the case. â€œCourts decide matters based on facts and the law. Do not be afraid, because this court has the jurisdiction to hear and determine this case,â€ Akungo said.
