Low voter turnout was witnessed in various polling stations in Laikipia county, despite massive mobilisation by local leaders during campaigns. A spot check by the Star established only 18 per cent turnout across most polling stations by noon yesterday. Addressing the media after casting his ballot, Deputy Governor John Mwaniki urged those who had remained at home to get out and vote. He voted at Central Park polling station in Nanyuki town.  He said they had organised for vehicles to ferry the elderly, sick and those from distant areas to polling stations. “We want the SGR to reach here and a university established. To achieve these, our people must come out in large numbers and vote for President Uhuru Kenyatta,” Mwaniki said.
