EACC has pulled out of a case challenging the authenticity of Taita Taveta Governor Granton Samboja’s Kenyatta University degree. The anti-corruption agency said it shall peruse a separate integrity case that is ongoing at the Milimani law courts.  It had been included as an interested party in a case filed before Voi High Court by Armstrong Kiwoi, a voter. Kiwoi wants the Governor's win nullified over claims that Samboja used forged documents to vie for the seat in the August 8 polls. He has also sued Kenyatta University and the IEBC for accepting Samboja’s degree certificate. In a pre-trial seating on Friday, Justice Eric Ogola allowed the anti-graft body to withdraw from the case saying it will not interfere with proceedings. He further set December 15 for the hearing and determination of two preliminary orders by Samboja seeking to bar the court from hearing the case. Samboja’s lawyer Edwin Ayiro said that the matter should be handled by another court and not the one adjudicating electoral disputes. Ogola said the final hearing shall be held between January 29 and February 2, 2018 and thereafter a ruling will be issued within three weeks. The petitioner has been granted 14 days to respond to Smaboja's preliminary notice. The Governor’s documents indicate that he studied certificate, diploma, and degree courses at Kenyatta University between 2002 and 2009. But Aaron Tanui, the institution's legal officer, through an affidavit denied that Samboja studied in the varsity. Read: EACC quizzes Samboja over ‘false documents’
