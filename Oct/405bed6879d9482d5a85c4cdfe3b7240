The majority of Kilifi voters snubbed the repeat presidential election yesterday. Polling stations in most constituencies opened at 6am, but there were few voters. Some people woke up as early as 5am to avoid long queues, but voting was fast. The Coast is generally considered an opposition zone, and NASA called for a boycott. But Jubilee has made  inroads.  In Malindi constituency, many residents said they would not vote as the rerun was  unconstitutional. They said it was meaningless if President Uhuru Kenyatta and NASA leader Raila Odinga — now national resistance movement leader — did not agree with the IEBC on the way forward. There was order in most polling stations and voting took less than three minutes.  Malindi police boss Matawa Muchangi said there was no violence.
