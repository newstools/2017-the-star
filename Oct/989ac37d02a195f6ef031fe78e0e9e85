Retail outlet Naivas Supermarket has said itâ€™s ready to take up spaces left vacant by the troubled Nakumatt in different malls if called upon. This follows the closure of Nakumatt branches at the Junction and Thika Road Mall in a period of less than one month due to increasing debt owed to the mall owners in form of rent.  The announcement, made by Naivas chief commercial officer Willy Kimani , came during the unveiling of the retailer's digital strategy plan which has seen the firm invested Sh103 million to launch the Naivas pay platform.  â€œWe have been called upon, and yes we are willing to go,â€ Kimani told the Star on the sidelines of the launch.  With most retailers facing an uncertain future, Kimani claimed Naivas was the only one with a serious positive cashflow and hence are considered favourites by many mall owners as anchor tenants. While eyeing the spaces, Naivas has also announced plans to introduce its e-commerce portal on November 26 at a cost of Sh180million.  The portal will harbor 11,300 products on its launch, most being fast-moving consumer goods.  The retailer intends to get at least 7 per cent of their total revenue from the portal in the next 2-3 years.  On their strategy for growth, Naivas is also working with partners to expand their real estate investments through partnerships.  On Monday, Dubai-owned retail outlet Carrefour announced its plan to replace Nakumatt as the anchor tenant in Thika Road Mall from next month.  Last month, Tuskys Supermarkets offered to merge with Nakumatt to salvage it from its current woes. The agreement will see the retailer access stock from suppliers using Tuskys' goodwill and value chain.
