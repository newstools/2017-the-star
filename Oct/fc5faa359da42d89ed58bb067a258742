The electoral agency is finalising preparations at the National Tallying Centre at the Bomas of Kenya ahead of tomorrow's fresh presidential election. Senior security officials led by police spokesman Charles
Owino yesterday convened at the centre. They inspected arrangements. IEBC public outreach and communication project manager
Tabitha Mutemi said the National Election Call Centre has been set up
and it is operational. Mutemi said the centre has started gauging the level of
preparedness in all constituencies in terms of election
materials allocation. She said the department has subdivided the country
into six clusters. Each cluster has ten officials who use toll-free lines to
liaise with returning officers. "The call centre is up and running with adequate personnel
to ensure election materials are available and functional at the
grassroots," Mutemi said. She said the officials are liaising with the 47 county
returning officers to come up with a report on the materials
dispatched to them. "Each cluster is dealing with 48 to 49 constituencies," she said. IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati toured the tallying centre, but declined to talk to the media.
