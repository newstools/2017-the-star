Girls in rural areas miss an average of four days every month during their menstrual period, Unicef has said.  Unicefâ€™s Agnes Makanyi said the number of girls going to institutions of higher learning is on the decline.  She spoke during the opening of the one-week national training of trainers on menstrual hygiene management workshop in Naivasha.  Makanyi said there are many taboos around periods, adding that more needs to be done to build capacity and break the silence.  â€œStatistics show girls lose 25 per cent of their hours in class every month during their menstrual cycle because they keep off school,â€ she said.
