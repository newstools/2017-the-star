Water PS Fred Segor has warned contractors and managers who have stalled ministry projects in Marakwet West that they will be blacklisted.  Segor on Monday accused the contractors of delaying Sh635 million projects that could have been completed in 2015.  The ministry is building new structures for five learning institutions displaced during establishment of Chebara Dam in 1997.  But Segor said the contractors had only done 60 per cent of the construction since 2013. â€œWe have asked the contractors to be to be observant of time.  We will delist those who will be found culpable after we finalise our investigations,â€ Segor said.  He blamed poor management by stakeholders for stalled construction of classrooms and dormitories in Chebara polytechnic, Chebara Boysâ€™ Secondary School, Chebara Girlsâ€™ Secondary School, Chebara Primary School and Kaptomut Primary School.  The PS said contractors and management boards found culpable of misappropriating funds for the projects will be prosecuted. Speaking after a tour of the project sites, Segor said the ministry will need Sh500 million to complete the stalled projects. â€œA number of the projects have stalled because of governance problems,â€ Segor said.
