Nine hundred youths from Kimilili constituency, Bungoma county, will benefit from the youth empowerment programme. They will be paid Sh510 per day. The youths will clean roads, clear bushes, collect garbage and unblock sewer drainage.  MP Didimus Baraza on Friday said the programme will be implemented under the Youth Affairs ministry. He said Sh110 from youthsâ€™ daily earnings will be saved in their sacco. â€œThis is the only way we can have our young people save money and access affordable loans,â€ MP Baraza said. The legislator said the move will create jobs and reduce crime.  â€œI have spoken to Governor Wycliffe Wangamati and hinted at the possibility of using the youths in cleaning our countyâ€™s major towns of Kimilili, Webuye and Bungoma,â€ Baraza said.
