Kenyan rapper Prezzo is said to be broke after he failed to pay for services at top recording studios in Tanzania. According to The Reverend's column on the Star's Sasa pullout, the rapper was even offered a 75% discount, but it was still too high. It is said that he walked from studio to studio looking for a cheaper offer. A source whispered to the Reverend that he gave out all his accessories to be allowed to record at a Tanzanian-based record label. “Braza, huyo msanii alitupea hizo bling bling zaka kwa sababu hakua na hela. Jameni, hatuwezi msaidia. Tulidhani yeye ni big deal huko Kenya, salala kumbe hana chochote!” Prezzo spoke to Kiss Fm website exclusively on the said matter. He rubbished the allegations and added that he instead bought more jewellery while over there. "Thats not true. I can even give you my video director's number. They can confirm that I went there and bought even more jewellery. I came back with more, not less, jewellery. I had my own stylist and I had everything intact. As a matter of fact with three people, we flew there, we didn't even drive." The 'My City My Town' hitmaker further says he is not using drugs and for him to fly out his crew to Tanzania shows he is financially stable. "All these allegations give people a rush when they point fingers at me. They will say Prezzo does drugs, but then I've never been to rehab even once in my lifetime. All these allegations are formulated out of  jealousy. For me to travel with my crew already goes to show we are financially fit. If  I wasn't, then I wouldn't be able to accommodate two other people with me." He went ahead to say he will not reveal the price of the jewellery he bought while in Tanzania because that is like an investment to him. "I cease to reveal such information. My jewellery speaks for itself. Ever since 2003, I've been wearing jewellery, I love it and its been like an investment."
