The National Police Service has deployed additional security officers to the Coast to ensure the presidential rerun is not disrupted. The region is a perceived NASA stronghold. The alliance has urged its supporters to boycott the election. Senior police officers have been instructed to ensure voting goes on. Two counties — Lamu and Kwale — are led by Jubilee governors. Coast regional police commandant Larry Kieng (pictured) yesterday said they have enough resources and staff to cover all 1,807 polling stations and 26 constituency tallying centres. “We are ready to take care of those who will be casting their votes and ensure peace prevails before and after the poll,” he said. Kieng warned political leaders against inciting their supporters to disrupt the exercise. “Any leader attempting to incite violence during the election will face the full force of the law. They’ll be arrested and prosecuted for violating election laws,” he said. “Security for the electoral agency’s commissioners and senior officials has been improved. Various agencies have prepared a security plan to secure the election.” Kieng said the regional security committee has identified potential hotspots that require more deployment. A leaked circular from police headquarters in Nairobi details elaborate measures to protect IEBC officials.
