The IEBC yesterday threw in the towel and postponed voting in four opposition bastions after day-long running battles between the
police and NASA supporters. After hours in a closed-door meeting, the
six-member commission announced they would postpone the polls in four Luo
Nyanza counties—the political bedrock of opposition chief Raila Odinga. Chairman Wafula Chebukati
said the election flopped in Migori, Siaya, Kisumu and Homa Bay and would be
held afresh on Saturday. The Constitution makes it mandatory that elections must be held in
all 290 constituencies. Article 138 (2) of the Constitution, on the procedure of presidential
elections, states, “If two or more candidates are nominated, an election shall
be held in each constituency.” It is not clear how the IEBC would
proceed with the polls in the NASA strongholds, with residents determined to sabotage
the process and local poll officials pulling out. Chebukati said they have written to Inspector General of Police Joseph
Boinnet, but were yet to get feedback on how the security challenges will be addressed. “Remember security is not in the hands of the
commission. We were promised security by the Inspector General of Police and
the government agencies," he said.  "Once we get feedback from them we will be able to see
how we can manage the movement of materials and security of our officials in
the respective counties.” Regulations
64a of the General Regulations states that the IEBC can
postpone an election where there is reason to believe that a serious breach of
peace is likely to occur. It can also postpone voting where it is impossible to conduct an election as a
result of a natural disaster or other emergencies.
