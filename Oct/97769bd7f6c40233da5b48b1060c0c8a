The High Court has directed Kenha to reinstall billboards it dismantled on Mombasa Road, next to Ole Sereni Hotel. Justice George Odunga said the decision to remove the billboards erected by Tangerine Investments Limited was improper.  Tangerine Investments is an outdoor advertising agency. It was their case that Kenha failed to give them notice and communicate the removal of street pole advertisements. The authority also did not give reasons for removing billboards. On Thursday, Odunga quashed the decision by Kenha to remove Tangerine Investments’s billboards on the Southern Bypass next to Airtel and Ole Sereni and advertising boards on Thika Road. The authority was compelled to unconditionally reinstall panels, equipment and advertisements to to their initial state and position. Tangerine Investments said it had complied with all requirements, including the payment of all fees to Nairobi county.
