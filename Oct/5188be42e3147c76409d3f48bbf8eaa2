Wajir county is putting in place measures to fast-track identification and prioritisation of ward-based development projects, Governor Mohamed Abdi has said. He said the ward-based development projects will alleviate poverty, unemployment and inequality. Abdi spoke when he addressed MCAs on Saturday during a meeting to discuss the implementation and guidelines of the ward-based projects. He said the success of the projects will depend on the role the MCAs play in identification, mobilisation and consensus building in their respective wards. “I’m glad to note that we will be able to implement close to 300 ward-based development projects this financial year. This will have a significant impact on the lives of our people at the grassroots level,” the governor said. Abdi said he has directed that the projects be consolidated in 10 days and be captured in the county supplementary budget. He has also directed the Finance executive to ensure the ward-based development projects are implemented and paid for by the third quarter of the financial year.  During the opening of the second Wajir county assembly last month, Abdi promised to allocate Sh25 million to every ward this financial year. The county has 30 wards. This will cost Sh750 million. Abdi has also formed a task force to find easier ways of implementing the ward-based development projects. The task force has recommended the maximum allocation for each project be Sh4 million. This is to ensure the procurement of these projects is done through request for quotations. The team has also proposed that each ward implements between seven and 10 projects every year.
