Elders have leaped to the defence of Tanzanian actress Elizabeth Lulu, who is charged with killing her then-lover bongo movie star Steven Kanumba in April 2012.  Lulu says Kanumba wanted to
attack her with a panga during a heated argument, after which he fell down and was unconscious. She then ran for her life, only to get news that Kanumba had died. A council of elders says according to the hearing of the case, Lulu did not kill Kanumba intentionally. After Kanumba’s death, Lulu was detained for almost half a year. Her case was finally heard last week, and it took five days. The next hearing will be on November 13.
