A low voter turnout marked the repeat presidential polls in most polling stations in Nakuru yesterday. Most polling stations in the county were idle, as others attended to few voters. At Kabarak University polling station in Rongai constituency, former President Daniel arap Moi cast his vote at 1pm. Moi (pictured) was received by presiding officer Jimmy Maison. He urged Kenyans to maintain the peace as they exercise their democratic right. “I urge Kenyans to be peaceful in order to prosper as a country. Peace is paramount for any development to take place,” he said. “We received materials on time and we have had no hiccups so far.” At Crater Primary, Nakuru Governor Lee Kinyanjui expressed optimism that the situation was expected to improve later in the day. He said it was irresponsible and unfair for politicians to call for a boycott of the rerun. “In every electoral contest, there has to be winners and losers. Kenyans should exercise their sovereignty through their elected representatives. This is only possible if they come out and vote,” Kinyanjui said. He said the economy has suffered because of prolonged electioneering, adding Kenyans must get back to work. The county boss said his administration had partnered with the private sector to ferry voters to travel to polling stations. In perceived NASA zones Kaptembwa, Heshima, Ronda and Kivumbini turnout was poor. Security officers kept vigil at polling stations and some patrolled. Former Governor Kinuthia Mbugua criticised NASA for calling for a resistance movement.
