Teachers Union KUPPET has threatened to join Nasa's weekly protests to oppose Jubilee's attempts to amend the election laws. The union's national chairman Omboko Milemba who is also the Emuhaya MP said it's time to resist bad laws geared at dividing the country. Milemba said such draconian laws should be rejected by all means. "We need to oppose these laws as they will affect everyone," he said. Addressing teachers in Siaya on Saturday, Milemba said any attempt to mutilate the constitution through the back door will not be tolerated. He said those championing to change election laws to favour their master are generic leaders who don't have the people's interests at heart. Milemba recalled how founding President Jomo Kenyatta disagreed with his vice President Jaramogi Oginga Odinga and went ahead to neutralize his powers by creating eight vice president positions. "What Kenyatta did is what President Uhuru is also applying to ensure that anybody in the corridors of IEBC and Judiciary can announce and swear him in as the president without Chebukati and Maraga," Milemba added. "That is why we must resist such laws to avoid being taken back to the dark days," he added. Milemba asked teachers not to be divided on the basis of personal interest but to champion for what is good now and for the next generations. The legislature mentioned that the genesis of the proposed change of election laws was the rot in IEBC and it's only fair that the responsible officials vacate office.
