The National Resistance Movement has been told to stay away from schools during KCPE and KCSE examinations. Athi River deputy county commissioner Geoffrey Omoding assured candidates and invigilators of security. “There will be no hooliganism in examination centres in the subcounty,” he said yesterday. Omoding said anybody who tries to interfere with the exams, which start today, will be exposing himself to danger. Roads in Joska, Ndovoini and Muthwani are in a poor state following heavy rains. Four-wheel-drives will be used to deliver exams in these areas and tractors in worst-case scenarios. “We want to avoid delays in issuing exams and ensure all candidates start sitting for the papers at the same time,”Omoding said. He said delays could lead to leaking of exams. “We are more prepared than ever. There is no leakage of examinations in [Education CS Fred] Matiang’i’s era,” Omoding said. He ordered teachers and security personnel to strictly follow procedures to avoid malpractices. “Avoid opening the papers early and open the right papers at the right time,” Omoding said.
