A police officer was killed yesterday when a vehicle transporting election materials to Balambala constituency overturned near Abdi Samit. The accident occurred 65km from Garissa town. The officer, identified as Fredrick Onyango, was among four others who were escorting the materials to Balambala when the driver lost control. He was trying to negotiate a corner at 4pm on Wednesday. Officer Samwel Njuguna suffered serious head injuries and was taken to Kenyatta National Hospital.  Officers Pius Kamau and Augustine Uhuru were slightly injured. They were treated at the Garissa Referral Hospital and discharged. Garissa county commissioner James Kianda said the IEBC brought in another vehicle to ferry the materials to Balambala. Kianda said security had been increased across the county and along the border with Somalia. Meanwhile, Northeastern regional commissioner Mohamud Saleh said voting started well in the region, including border towns that have suffered al Shabaab attacks. He said some areas experienced heavy rains, leading to delayed dispatch of election materials and late opening of polling stations. Voting in all other areas started on time and no hitches were reported. Kenyans returned to the polls after the Supreme Court on September 1 annulled President Uhuru Kenyattaâ€™s victory in the August 8 General Election. NASA leader Raila Odinga withdrew from the race, saying it was rigged. He urged his supporters not to demonstrate, lest they be killed.
