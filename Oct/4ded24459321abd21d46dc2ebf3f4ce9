NASA and Jubilee should make realistic demands and let the IEBC prepare for the October 26 presidential polls, Kangundo MP Fabian Muli (pictured) has said. He said politicians across the political divide are making unrealistic demands. â€œKenya is a third world, not first world, country. Letâ€™s make demands that are practical to enable the IEBC to conduct a free, fair and credible repeat presidential election on October 26,â€ Muli said. He spoke in his constituency on Monday during the official handover of the MP office from former legislator Mutatha Maweu. Muli said NASA and Jubilee leaders are not statesmen. He said the country cannot be built using the politics of tribalism. Muli said politicians should respect the Supreme Court and allow the IEBC to conduct the repeat election.
