ODM has distanced itself from looting at a supermarket in Kisumu during anti-IEBC protests on Friday. Executive director Oduor Ong'wen condemned the incident saying it is a broader scheme to delegitimise ongoing demonstrations calling for electoral justice. "The deliberate and conspicuous absence of the police as this incident happened points to an unacceptable complicity and choreography for which the local police leadership must come out clean," the statement from ODM read. Ong'wen asked police to investigate the incident, adding that police should protect property. "This is more critical than their obsession with throwing tear gas and meting ruthless brutality on innocent and law-abiding citizens," he added.

Police were forced to lob teargas canisters and shoot in the air to disperse supporters opposed to the retention of the IEBC team ahead of the October 26 vote. Several of them broke into the supermarket, defied workers who tried to stop them and injured some of them. Property worth an unknown amount of money was stolen and the store's windows smashed. The protesters only left after police fired teargas at them after arriving in Land Cruisers and water cannon trucks.
