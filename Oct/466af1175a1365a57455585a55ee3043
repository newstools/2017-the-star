President Uhuru Kenyatta has told voters to stop wasting time on demonstrations and cast their ballots instead. While addressing Garissa residents on Monday, Uhuru said NASA leader Raila Odinga is scared of taking part in the October 26 repeat presidential poll. "He moved to court and the Supreme Court ruled in his favour making us go back to campaigns. If he wants what's best for Kenya, let him take part in the poll. "If he does not want to be on the ballot, it's also his right. He can just sit at home and watch as the rest of the country takes part in the process," the President said. He cautioned residents against being used in the protests. "If you feel you want to take part in demos, it's your democratic right. Just don't destroy or loot from peaceful citizens. Walk peacefully, get water where you can and once you get home and your wife asks you where you were, tell her you decided not to fend for your children but opted to take part in a demo," he said.
