A majority of voters in Kuria, Migori county stayed away from Thursday's repeat presidential election despite campaigns by Deputy President William Ruto. Voting in the area started as early as six am in the morning, but few voters come to the polling centers to cast their ballots. Out of 51,057 registered voters in Kuria West constituency, only 20,074 participated. In Kuria East, only 13,500 out of 35,158 registered voters cast their ballot. They are the only constituencies in Migori that took part in the election that was largely ignored in six other constituencies in the county. IEBC intends to conduct elections in Migori, Kisumu, Homa Bay and Siaya on Saturday, but residents have said they will not be part of the exercise.

Others candidates in the race are Ekuru Aukot (53), Abduba Dida (26), Cyrus Jirongo (14), Japheth Kaluya (19), Joseph Wainaina (7), and Joseph Nyagah (26). Some 128 votes were spoilt. Two weeks ago former Budalangâ€™I MP Ababu Namwamba and other Jubilee leaders were hosted by MPs Marwa Kitayama (Kuria East) and Mathias Robi (Kuria West) to set the ground for a visit by the Deputy President. During the two high-level campaigns, they urged residents to come out in large numbers and vote for President Uhuru Kenyatta by more votes than botched August 8 polls. In the August presidential poll, whose results were nullified by the Supreme Court, president Uhuru Kenyatta garnered 41,951 votes (65 per cent of the cast votes) while Raila garnered 21,202 votes (34 per cent of the cast votes) in Kuria.
