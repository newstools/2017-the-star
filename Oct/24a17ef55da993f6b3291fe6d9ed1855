Police were on Sunday forced to shoot in the air to disrupt Raila Odinga's procession within Mombasa. This is after the NASA presidential candidate flanked by Moses Wetangula, Musalia Mudavadi and Governor Joho attended a political rally atÂ  Mama Ngina Drive. Their supporters had barricaded Digo road. Raila, atop his vehicle, was being escorted by a crowd of over 1,000 supporters who had attended the first NASA rally after nullification of presidential results. Fracas ensured near GPO Posta, where the blockade was erected.  Police confronted the group, denying them passage. The crowd charged and attempted to force its way through, before the shots were fired. Raila's motorcade was about 200 meters behind. NASA supporters had jammed both sides of road. After firing, police started to clobber part of the group. Raila's motorcade opted to divert, making its way through Moi Avenue. But police kept following them. No strike was launched towards Raila or his escort, however. Urban OCPD Lucas Ogara said they were containing the crowd after some started stealing. He denied police fired shots at the supporters. "We have one person in custody as he tried to snatch a lady's hand bag," Ogara said. At Zamzam area, in Kisauni, police broke-up gatherings of NASA supporters by drubbing them with batons. An eyewitness said one person has been rushed to hospital. "Police were not allowing any form of assembly," the witness said. Raila said anti-IEBC demonstration will go on. He is expected to take part in Mombasa's on Monday.
