Mike Sonko declared on Saturday that Jubilee will swear-in President Uhuru Kenyatta after October 26 - the date set by IEBC for a repeat poll. But the law says only the Chief Justice or deputy CJ can do this. The Nairobi Governor said NASA will not scuttle their plans by withdrawing from the ballot. Raila Odinga said he will not take part in another sham election "whose organisers are hell-bent to botch". But Sonko said it is not a must for the ODM leader to take part. "We as Jubilee we are prepared. We want the election to be held on the date set by IEBC and after that, we shall swear-in President Uhuru," he said in Mombasa when he met the Kamba community. Sonko claimed the Opposition is working with international entities to undermine Uhuru's presidency. "This will not dampen our decision to go to election," he said, adding the coalition is avoiding the poll to cause a crisis. During Jubilee Party campaigns in Murang'a yesterday, Uhuru told international communities there is no crisis in Kenya and that they are not welcome for peace talks. He chided Raila for "kneeling" before them for help. Uhuru alleged Raila had asked the communities to help mediate them and save Kenya from crumbling.

He said the President abandoned his tribesman in the Nairobiâ€‹ county chief race to support him. He was referring to Peter Kenneth who has not been in the limelight since the election on August 8. Sonko said the community has resolved to back Uhuru's candidature.

Peter Munyaka (Machakos Town), Vincent Musyoka (Mwala) and Nimrod Mbai (Kitui East) and several others denounced leaders who engage in empty politics. "Machakos people want peace, development and income-generating activities for the youth, not violence propagated by NASA through anti-IEBC demos," said Munyaka. "I laud the acting Interior CS Fred Matiang'i for issuing orders of no more demonstrations in major cities and towns across the country. Crooks have invaded the demos." Munyaka said President Uhuru Kenyatta should sign the controversial elections laws which he received on Friday. "The amended laws are pro-active. The Supreme Court said many things on August 8 elections irregularities. The laws will solve the problems Supreme Court highlighted during its ruling," he said during a National Youth Service recruitment in Machakos town on Thursday.

The Opposition said there was rigging so Uhuru would get re-elected. Following his petition, the Supreme Court ordered a fresh election and asked IEBC to make changes so errors are not repeated.

"Kambas should not be cheated that we can survive outside government; that is lying to ourselves. We will continue working with Uhuru and his government," he said. "It is for that reason that I was re-elected to Parliament. I am calling on those who voted Munyaka on August 8 to vote Uhuru on October 26." Musyoka said voting for a candidate other than the President "is voting out Munyaka for an opposition MP  thereby barring opportunities and goodies". He said residents should not associate with Opposition slogans Tialala and Tibim slogans since "this is devil worship". "Youths need jobs and more employment opportunities," he added.
