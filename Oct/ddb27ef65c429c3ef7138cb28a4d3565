An 80-year-old woman was on Friday among more than 2,000 graduands of St Paulâ€™s University. Janet Silla graduated with a masters degree in Community Development. She said when she joined the university, a lot of students and lecturers thought she was in the wrong place. â€œSome would ask me, do you know where you are? What are you up to?â€ she said. â€œDuring the first week, I didnâ€™t take notes. I was wondering what people are writing, while lecturers were lecturing.â€ Silla, who lives in Westlands, said she decided to go back to school to gain more knowledge and empower women and youth. She was born in Itetani village, Makueni county. Silla joined Kamagambo Teachers College in Nyanza in 1958 and was later posted at Karura SDA Primary School, where she started teaching.  Silla stopped teaching in 1960. The mother of four was later employed by the Postal Corporation of Kenya as a telephone operator and posted to Kajiado 1967. She quit the job in 1971 to venture in self-employment. Silla later went back to school and graduated with a degree in Social Work and Counselling at Bugema University, Uganda, in 2012. She said if she gets funds, she can continue with her education.  Silla urged the young people to further their education. During the graduation that was held at the university's main campus in Limuru, chief guest Justice Kihara Kariuki urged students to be creative with the aim of helping society. "Society expects educated people to make an impact. That is why you realise, even old people want to get an education,â€ he said.
