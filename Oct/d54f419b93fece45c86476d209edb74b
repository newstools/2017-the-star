Kenya men’s national volleyball side settled for the 10th place at the just concluded Africa Nations Championships with a 50 per cent win record in six matches at the tournament staged in Cairo, Egypt. To the dismay of many, the East African side beat Libya, Nigeria and Chad, and lost to eight-time holders and now finalists Tunisia and twice to continental volleyball returnees Ghana. Kenya, comprising of a youthful side - with an average age of 22 and lacking in exposure - had begun the showpiece on a 1:2 win-loss ratio in the group stage before leveling it to 3:3 (1:1) at the end of the competitions. They lost to Ghana and Tunisia (25-16, 26-24, 25-15) and (25-16, 25-19, 25-22) respectively in their first two duels. In a five-set thriller, Moses Epoloto’s charges grabbed their first win in the last Pool ‘B’ match against Libya, coming from two sets down to beat the North Africans 3-2 (16-25, 20-25, 25-21, 25-21, 15-12). Despite the win, Kenya had already been consigned to participate in the classification round after they’d soaked in two losses (in straight sets) . The victory against Libya gave the Kenyan outfit the momentum, leading them to win their next two ties against Nigeria and Chad. But once again, in an East versus West Africa face-off, Kenyans did not exhibit the zeal to overturn their opening tie defeat against Ghana, losing again without grabbing a set (22-25, 16-25, 20-25). In a give and take match, Kenya entertained Nigeria in a five-setter winning 2-3 (20-25, 25-20, 19-25, 25-22, 13-15). The boys went on to hammer Central African side, Chad, in straight sets of 20-25, 21-25 and 20-25 in their last win. Speaking on the behalf of Kenya Volleyball Federation, first vice chairman who is also in charge of development of the game, Martin Makokha was pleased with the team’s performance, noting that they surpassed KVF’s expectations. “As a federation, we are very happy with the performance. We did not think they would win a match but they went on to bring home three victories. We didn’t want to put pressure on them to perform because this is the first time 90 per cent of the squad was featuring in international competition. They grew from set to set,” said Makokha. “If the team is maintained, it will bring the best ever results in the men’s division. We are also looking to enter the men’s under 23 outfit in the continentals next year,” added Makokha who cited the lack of sponsorship for the team as the biggest hurdle.
