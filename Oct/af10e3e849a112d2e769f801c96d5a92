They have been fighting running battles with the anti-IEBC NASA protesters in the city in the pretext of protecting “our” businesses from looters and destruction. But who exactly are the members of this group calling itself the Nairobi Business Community? Their physical appearance and utterances have left many wondering if they are genuine businesspeople, with others linking them to the outlawed Mungiki sect. The Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry has disowned it, terming members strangers. Its members have dreadlocks and they invoke the ‘Thaai’ while facing Mt Kenya before addressing conferences. These were the characteristics of the Mungiki sect. But the group’s chairman Wilfred Kamau distances it from the sect, saying members are genuine traders in the city out to guard their businesses from theft by ‘NASA’ goons. NASA supporters have been holding demonstrations in the city and other parts of the country, demanding the removal of IEBC chief executive Ezra Chiloba, whom they claim was the mastermind behind the bungled August 8 presidential elections. Business owners and motorists have, however, claimed the demonstrators have been looting and destroying their premises. “You cannot profile people and call them names just because of the way they dress and their lifestyle,” Kamau said.  He added, “How do you define Mungiki? How many people in this county have dreadlocks? Juliani (rapper) is dreadlocked, is he Mungiki? What about Maina Njenga who people have linked to Mungiki yet he has no dreadlocks?” Kamau said members are small-scale traders in the city; some hawkers whose businesses are not insured and they cannot allow demonstrators to loot.
