Former Prime Minister Raila Odinga risks being arrested and charged with treason if he sabotages the election or declares himself president after Thursday, Tiaty MP Asman Kamama (pictured) has said. He spoke to the Star on the phone on Tuesday. “So people can choose to remain in their houses or attend to their farms that day if they choose not to vote, rather than going to the roads or the polling stations intending to cause chaos and disrupt the peaceful and credible exercise,” Kamama said. He urged Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet and acting Interior CS Fred Matiang’i to be firm, decisive and tough and make sure the presidential winner is announced.
