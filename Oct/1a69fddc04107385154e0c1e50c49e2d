Accept defeat and allow the country to move on, two Nyeri Jubilee MPs have told NASA leaders. Mathira MP Rigathi Gachagua and his Kieni counterpart Kanini Kega said politicking time is over and it is time Kenyans resumed their normal lives. “We want the swearing in of President Uhuru Kenyatta to be conducted in the next seven days. We also don’t want to be engaged in unnecessary dialogue. We must move on,” Gachagua said. He spoke on Friday at Kirigu Primary School. Uhuru garnered 84,997 votes of the 99,496 registered voters in Mathira. NASA leader Raila Odinga got 132. The constituency registered a 85.4 per cent voter turnout In Kieni, Kega said Kenya is not ready for a national resistance movement. Last Wednesday, Raila announced that NASA had morphed into a national resistance movement. But he later said the movement is just a wing in NASA. “Kenyans are tired of these politics. A whole year has been wasted. The economy has deteriorated due to politics. Kenyans are very tired of these politics,” Kega said. He spoke at Mweiga Girls Secondary School. Uhuru garnered 89,923 votes in Kieni out of 109,001 registered voters. Raila got 106 votes. There was an 83 per cent turnout.
