IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati has defended the 48 per cent turnout the commission declared following Thursday's repeat election. "The 48% was a best estimate turnout from the team. Latest actual figures from 267 constituencies show 6,553,858 Kenyans turned out to vote," he said via twitter. He said the electoral agency will continue to receive data as the devices report. "We shall provide a comprehensive update tomorrow morning," the chair replied in another tweet. Pictures from the election showed that the polling stations were not busy as compared to August 8. The said election was nullified following a petition NASA leader Raila Odinga and his deputy Kalonzo Musyoka filed at the Supreme Court. At least 35,664 polling stations were opened for the repeat presidential election on Thursday, IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati has said. He said the stations, representing 87 per cent of those opened, sent a message indicating that the election went on. "Some 5,319 polling stations did not send an opening message," Chebukati said adding that 50 constituencies had all the polling stations opened at 100 per cent. "We have received 27,124 forms 34A, which is 80 per cent of the polling stations," he added. The chair earlier said at least 35,664 polling stations were opened for the election pitting President Uhuru Kenyatta and six others. Raila withdrew from the race and urged his supporters to stay away from polling stations. Short queues characterised the activities of the day as many NASA supporters stayed away. This is according to the argument on social media about the election. But Chebukati said 87 per cent of the 40,883 polling stations sent a message indicating that the election went on. "Some 5,319 polling stations did not send an opening message," Chebukati said in a briefing. He said that 50 constituencies had all the polling stations opened at 100 per cent.
