Kwale woman representative Zuleikha Juma yesterday offered to help set up a talent centre for people living with disability. She proposed to use the national government’s Affirmative Action Fund. “The fund is meant to help locals by supporting their lives. Write a proposal for you to be funded,” Juma. Speaking when she met Kinango Disability Network members, she said the centre will provide job opportunities to youths. They will be equipped with skills they can use in generating income. The fund is meant to support the disabled, women, youths, elderly and children. Juma said her office will make sure all intended beneficiaries are supported through the kitty. She said the disabled will get seven per cent of jobs in her office. The lawmaker said plans are underway to include them on sublocation committees.
