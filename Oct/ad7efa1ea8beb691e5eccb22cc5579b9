NASA co-principal Musalia Mudavadi has said the IEBC is to blame for
the chaos in the country.  He told the BBC on Friday that the
commission's decision to force the repeat elections on people was wrong.  "You cannot have police all over the place and tell people
to go and vote. That is intimidation," Musalia said an interview
on Focus on Africa.  The opposition called for electoral reforms before Thursday
election following the nullification of the August 8 presidential vote.

This was after IEBC chair Wafula Chebukati said that commission cannot hold free
and fair elections because it was divided.
 "This is double speak because the IEBC itself told us that
it cannot hold a credible election. The commission itself has created a crisis," Mudavadi said.   Musalia said that the awaited announcement to its supporters
on what products was not to be viewed as unrealistic.  "We all feel the pinch as well but the IEBC is the problem. Had the elections been free and fair this would not have taken place."   Also read: IEBC postpones elections in Nyanza, to announce new dates
