The National Super Alliance begins its programme of mass protests against the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission and Jubileeâ€™s amendments to the election laws today. NASA is acting within its constitutional rights, but this also requires that they do not infringe on the rights of other Kenyans, including members of the ruling Jubilee Party, to enjoy their protections by the same Constitution. Kisumu Governor Anyangâ€™ Nyongâ€™o led the way a week ago when he personally walked at the head of a massive protest in that city in a procession that went without incident and then went back to work and urged everyone else to do so. The countless protest demos that take place in the West on virtually a daily basis take the greatest care not to interrupt or disrupt the rights of others. In London, Paris, Berlin, New York and Quebec, there are many demos that are actually escorted by police outriders and in which there are no looting, mugging and theft. NASA should follow in Governor Nyongâ€™o's footsteps.
