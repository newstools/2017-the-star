Celebrity stylist Eric One Wash has responded to claims by his baby mama, Sasha Pendeza, that he is dead beat, womanizer and wife batterer. Eric started of by clarifying that she is jus his baby mama and he is not married to her. Sasha took to Instagram to claim that Eric's lifestyle is financed by sugar mummies. "I don't need a sponsor,"Eric told Word Is, "Kama ningekua na sponsor ningakaa nyumbani, I shouldn't be hustling." Eric continued, "Kila mtu anajua I schooled the lady and I take care of her and my kid. Anataka public sympathy. Anataka tu ku-damage jina yangu. Apparently we are not together. Hizo zote ni malice tu." He went ahead to say that he never beats her and she was simply lying adding that "we don't stay together. She does not work, sasa pesa ya kushughulikia mtoto ilikua inatoka kwa nani? And the parents are also not helping her. She was just lying about all those things." He adds; "I'm not sure about her intentions but I know she wants attention." Yesterday, Sasha pulled down the post and published an apology. “I apologize for everything I wrote about this matter. It’s very sensitive for everyone’s image. Everyone involved. I know the damage done can not be reversed but I can prevent any further damages that can happen in future.I apologize to Eric’s clients and friends , for what has been happening in the last 24 hours. I was angry. It was false,” Sasha wrote.
