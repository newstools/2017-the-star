The Ministry of Health will carry out a survey for cancer diagnostic imaging capacity in Kenya. A majority of Kenyans cannot access or afford medical imaging techniques as most facilities are in Nairobi. The ministry said it will institutionalise a technical working group with an oversight committee to oversee the planning of imaging services for cancer diagnosis . Kenya lacks clinical guidelines for the use of the existing medical imaging equipment. “We will develop, adopt and adapt guidelines and algorithms for diagnostic imaging workup of priority cancers in both children and adults for each level of care,” Health CS Dr Cleopa Mailu (pictured) said. The ministry will also implement national guidelines for radiology diagnostic imaging and nuclear medicine imaging in accordance to International Atomic Energy Agency guidelines he said. Medical imaging is the visualisation of body parts, tissues and organs, for use in clinical diagnosis, treatment and disease monitoring and the field encompasses radiology, nuclear medicine, optical imaging and image-guided intervention according to the cancer control strategy 2017-2022 . The WHO cites infrastructure as an important aspect in imaging services which includes trained medical, technical and engineering staff, radiation protection measures and regulations for optimisation of delivery of radiation doses delivered during CT and fluroscopy. The ministry is seeking to improve and strengthen cancer medical imaging infrastructure.
