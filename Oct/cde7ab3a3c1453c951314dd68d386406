More than 50 senior City Hall staff have either been suspended or sent on compulsory leave over allegations of financial and land irregularities This is part of Governor Mike Sonko’s housecleaning. All the 17 chief officers have been sent home. They’ve been told to reapply for their jobs. Thirteen officials in the legal department and six from Finance were affected. The Lands chief officer Stephen Mwangi and several officers in the department are also on suspension. The Star has established a senior communication officer and several Physical planning and rates officers have been sent on compulsory leave. The governor is trying to dismantle land-grabbing rackets and corrupt networks at the county headquarters. They have been fleecing residents and defrauding the county, he says. Critics say the governor is using flimsy grounds to sack staff to create room for his loyalists and campaigners. Legal services director Karisa Iha, lawyers Gad Awuonda, Nyagara Nyamweya, Violet Oyangi, Evans Mogire, John Ombogi and Newton Mung’ala are among those sent on compulsory leave on October 2. Sonko said said there was a group that attempted to grab eight Sh1 billion maisonettes off Ndemi lane, Ngong Road, belonging to Hawa Mohedin. Finance chief officer Luke Gatimu, head of Treasury Maurice Ochieng, head of Revenue Nixon Awuor, Shaban Asman and Bedan Wambui were also suspended. The five were arrested on August 29 after Sonko filed a police complaint. They were allegedly caught by the governor with Sh7 million stashed in their office during a sting operation. It should have been banked. They were arraigned on September 20. Rates chief accountant Peter Muriithi and director of public communications Beryl Okundi were also suspended. Okundi was replaced by former Kiambu communications director Mukami Kamau. “I don’t think I will go back to City Hall. I’d rather retire or resign. I‘ve a name to protect,” said one of the affected officers.
