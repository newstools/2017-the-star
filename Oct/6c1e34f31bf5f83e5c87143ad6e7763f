National Resistance Movement leaders yesterday said the drop in President Uhuru Kenyatta’s votes from 8.3 million in the nullified August poll has exposed the IEBC’s election fraud. ANC leader and opposition presidential chief campaigner Musalia Mudavadi lauded NASA supporters for boycotting the Thursday election and “exposing the IEBC by proving Uhuru did not win”. Mudavadi said the low voter turnout, standing at about six million, is making it difficult for Uhuru to attain the 8.3 million votes he got to win against his archrival Raila Odinga. In August, the turnout stood at 14 million out of 19 million registered voters. Raila got 6.7 million votes. “The citizens have finally opened the servers that the IEBC refused to open. The boycott has shown that the so-called numbers and percentages that Jubilee and Uhuru Kenyatta have been talking about were all along fraudulent,” Mudavadi said. He spoke in Nairobi on Friday. Mudavadi was accompanied by Siaya Senator James Orengo and 15 opposition lawmakers. He said, “Uhuru lost the August election and has again lost this sham one in which he was basically running against himself.” Raila withdrew from the repeat presidential polls, leaving Uhuru with six other candidates after the IEBC failed to meet his 12-point electoral reforms demands for a credible election. Mudavadi told the IEBC and Jubilee to stop forcing residents in the four Nyanza counties of Homa Bay, Kisumu, Migori and Siaya to participate in the fresh polls on Saturday. The polls were postponed due to insecurity and resistance from voters. “We are asking the IEBC to call off the forced polls. The motive is clearly wicked...” Mudavadi said.
