French-based retailer Carrefour yesterday announced it will replace Nakumatt as the new anchor tenant at the popular Thika Road Mall. Since 2013, Nakumatt Supermarkets has been the main tenant at TRM, occupying a shopping floor space of 80,000 square feet. On September 18 however, the struggling retailer suspended activities at the mall attributing the closure to a stock-taking exercise.  However, a week later, workers were seen moving the giant elephant sculpture from the entrance amid speculation that the retailer could no longer afford tenancy at the mall, signifying its exit from the premises. Carrefourâ€™s entry will mark Majid Al Futtaimâ€™s, the owners of the retailer, third hypermarket in the country in less than two years. The store will cover two floors of the mall.  â€œThe opening of our third Carrefour store in less than two years of operations illustrates our ambitious growth and expansion plans in the region,â€ Majid Al Futtaim country manager Franck Moreau said. â€œThis new hypermarket will offer our customers who use the busy highway access to a wide variety of products at the most competitive prices, offered at world-class standards.â€ The opening of the new branch at TRM will boost the staff employment count at Carrefour in Kenya to 800, with 640 already working at the other two branches located at The Hub in Karen and the Two Rivers Mall. Moreau added Majid Al Futtaim is actively seeking opportunities to open stores in Kenya and the rest of the greater East African region in the coming years.  This is in line with attaining the companyâ€™s plans to cater for the growing population with a wide range of products. Nakumatt on Sunday announced the closure of its Junction Mall branch along Ngong Road, where the retailer was also the anchor tenant.
