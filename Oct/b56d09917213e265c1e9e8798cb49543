Rapper Nyashinski is the only East African star nominated for the award of Best African Act at this year's MTV EMAs. He is a clear favourite this year. The EMAs will be hosted in London. Nyashinski will be battling for the gong with Babes Wodumo, C4 Pedro, Davido, Nasty C and Wizkid. Hours after the nomination was announced, Nyashinski's management told Word Is:  "This is a great moment for him. Nyashinski, his music director Cedo and the whole team are very excited about it. Much appreciation to the fans for the love they have shown that have led to this moment. Now it's to get East Africa voting for Nyashinski, because a win for him is a win for Kenya and East Africa at large, as it opens more eyes to the region. We gotta keep pushing that!"  So, will it increase Nyashinski's asking price? His reps laughed and said, "But seriously, the team has and always continuously strives to deliver a brand on stage that will deliver an experience worth paying premium for. As the brand grows, the stage presentation grows, and of course, that requires more resources." Adding, "The gigs are coming in. Endorsements are on the table, under discussion. However, we are always striving not to just quickly sign on the dotted line and await bank deposit notifications. We need to be sure and ready to deliver an experience, numbers and a return on investment in whatever we get into. Many a time it means we suggest tweaks to what the client wants. We deep-dive and study deals hard."
