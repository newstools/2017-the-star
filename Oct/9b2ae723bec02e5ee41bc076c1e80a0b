A â€˜daughterâ€™ of veteran politician Jackson Kibor now wants DNA tests conducted to prove that he is her biological father. Loise Kibor is the daughter of Kiborâ€™s second wife Josephine who lost a divorce case with her husband on Friday last week. Chief magistrate Charles Obulutsa ordered that the coupleâ€™s 51-year marriage certificate be cancelled on grounds of Josephineâ€™s cruelty to her 83-year-old husband. Josephine was given 30 days to appeal the ruling. She already indicated that her lawyers will file an appeal this week. During the hearing, Kibor had disowned Loise. He said he married her mother in 1966 when she was already carrying the pregnancy. â€œI donâ€™t recognise her as my daughter and I will not give her anything as inheritance,â€ Kibor said in Eldoret after Fridayâ€™s ruling. However, Loise insisted that Kibor is her biological father and demanded that a DNA test be conducted to prove the claim. â€œI am ready to go for DNA tests anywhere to prove that Kibor is my biological father,â€ Loise said. She said the test must be conducted in a public hospital with independent medics who cannot be influenced by the wealthy businessman.
