Seven people have been arrested in Kisumu county over Friday's violent anti-IEBC demos. The authorities say two were arrested for breaking into and looting Tumaini Supermarket, while five hurled stones at passers-by. The police are looking for goods stolen from Tumaini and the culprits. NASA has called a series of peaceful demonstrations aimed at reforming the IEBC and opposing Jubilee Partyâ€™s reform of the Election Laws ahead of the repeat presidential polls on October 26. The demos are now held thrice weekly (Monday, Wednesday and Friday). NASA, and indeed anyone else in Kenya, has the constitutional right to petition and hold demos, provided they are peaceable.  NASA has distanced itself from the looting and attacks on the public. ODM executive director Oduor Ong'wen condemned the Tumaini incident, saying it is a broader scheme to delegitimise the demos against electoral injustice. Both the NASA leadership and the police must do everything lawful to keep the demos free of criminals and attacks on the public and property.
