The Nairobi government in partnership with Dettol yesterday launched a hand washing campaign which seeks to prevent disease and deaths caused by poor hygiene. The ‘Give Life a Hand’ campaign was launched during the Global Handwashing Day celebrations at the Our Lady of Nazareth Primary School in Mukuru kwa Njenga.  County deputy director of Public Health Jairus Musumba said it is critical for children to keep their hands clean to reduce the number of deaths attributed to preventable diseases including diarrhoea. Diarrhoea is the fourth most common cause of fatalities among children under five years in the city, especially in the slums. “It is mostly caused by if one touches dirt that contains disease-causing organisms and they don’t wash their hands,” Musumba said. He continued, “If we wash our our hands, then 98 per cent of all cases will be dealt with.” Residents have been urged to wash their hands frequently.
