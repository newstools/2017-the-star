Some 150,249 candidates will sit the KCPE exam in Nyanza from today. This is an increase by 14,156 candidates from last year’s, Education regional coordinator Richard Chepkawai said yesterday. He attributed this to the waiver of exam fees by the government. “In the previous years some candidates were forced to drop because they could not raise the registration fee,” Chepkawai said. He said all is set and adequate security has been put in place. The candidates will be spread out in 4,524 centres. Yesterday was rehearsal day. Chepkawai said all the exam materials have been received and secured. The government has organised for transport to deliver materials from 47 containers to the centres. Chepkawai said the Teachers Service Commission has deployed supervisors and invigilators to all the centres. Some 100,781 candidates are expected to sit the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education exam, an increase of 9,303 from last year’s. Chepkawai said adequate measures have been put in place to ensure that there is no exam leakage. “Just like last year, there will be no leakages and cheating,” he said. Nyanza regional commissioner Wilson Njega said security officers have been deployed in all exam centres. Njega assured parents, teachers and candidates that no unforeseen challenges will arise. The Kenya Union of Post Primary Education Teachers has urged the IEBC not to organise any election in the region during the duration of the exams. Voting did not take place in four Nyanza counties. “We demand a conducive environment for candidates, devoid of brutality for credible exams,” he said. “Education CS Fred Matiang’i, who is also acting Interior CS, must ensure the same, particularly for day scholars who get caught up in violent demos.”
