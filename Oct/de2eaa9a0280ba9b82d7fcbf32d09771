Nyandarua MCAs on Monday passed a motion requiring the county government to allocate more funds for hiring ECDE teachers. The assembly said the county does not have enough teachers. Education committee chairman Sambigi Mukuria, who moved the motion, said the county has not fully implemented free pre-primary education program in its ECDE centers. He said the centres do not have enough teachers and that the county has not developed a scheme of service for the few existing ones. As a result, parents are forced to pay for the centres to hire more teachers. "This expressly contravene the requirements of the Constitution that guarantees free and compulsory basic education for all children," Mukuria said. Nyandarua has 470 public and 231 private ECDE centers with a total enrollment of 21,933 pupils.  The county has engaged just 400 ECDE teachers. Mukuria said that number falls far below the acceptable ideal of one teacher per 25 pupils. He said pupils cannot concentrate because the classes are overcrowded. “The government should therefore be more involved in recruitment of teachers and ensure that parents don’t pay for the same,” Mukuria said.
