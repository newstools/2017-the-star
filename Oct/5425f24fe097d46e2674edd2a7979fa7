A court has ordered the IEBC to release Forms 35A, 35B, 35C to Suleiman
Murunga in 10 days.  Murunga of Ford Kenya has challenge the election of Jubilee’s Didmus Barasa on August
8. “In view that For 33s are placed
inside the ballot boxes, I order that they be retrieved, certified copies made
and originals returned to the boxes and closed using new seals,” High Court judge Anthony Murima said. The court denied an
application by the petitioner to add a witness statement. Murima said witness
statements were to be filed alongside the petition within the specified
timelines. “...which should be done 28 days after the declaration of results and thus
the court declines the request to have an affidavit added,” he said.
