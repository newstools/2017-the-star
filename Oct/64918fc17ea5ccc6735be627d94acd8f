Homa Bay Governor Cyprian Awiti has directed various health facilities to offer free medical treatment to residents with bullet injuries following anti-election protests. “Let all health facilities with such patients offer treatment first before they ask for money. My government is going to settle the bills for the victims,” he said. Awiti spoke at Homa Bay Referral Hospital on Saturday, when he visited patients. He raised concerns about residents being shot with live bullets. Awiti faulted the anti-riot police for using excessive force to disperse protesters. He said some police broke into protesters’ houses and beat them. Awiti said the majority of those molested by police were peaceful protesters. “We condemn these acts of brutality by the police. It’s an archaic way of handling protesters,” he said.  Awiti told IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati to leave residents alone and not force them to participate in the repeat presidential election. “To vote or not to vote, according to Kenya’s supreme law, is optional. But since residents have refused, the IEBC should spare them,” he said.  Awiti questioned the deployment of heavy security to the county. He said the move is provocative. “We all want to stay in peace and harmony with everybody. There is no coexistence that can be achieved by deploying police in an area...” he said. At least three people have succumbed to bullet injuries following anti- election protests in the county. Many others have been admitted to hospital after being beaten by anti-riot police. In Migori, Friday night was one of terror as police officers allegedly stormed estates, shot a man dead and injured 22 people.
