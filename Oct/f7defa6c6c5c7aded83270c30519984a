Equity Bank Group has recorded a three per cent drop in net profit for the three months to September 2017, joining lenders that are counting the cost of reduced interest income on customer loans following rate caps. The bank’s net profit for the third quarter stood at Sh14.6 billion, compared with Sh15.1 billion in same quarter last year. The lender’s profit before tax dropped four per cent to stand at Sh20.7 billion, down from Sh21.5 billion the same quarter in 2016. Equity Bank Group chief executive officer James Mwangi attributed the fall in profit to a tough operating environment worsened by protracted the presidential election causing political uncertainty with adverse effects on the Nairobi Stock Exchange and interest rate capping with negative impacts on private sector credit growth. The lender’s income dropped by 28 per cent to settle at Sh25 billion, down from Sh34 billion the previous year. Equity’s net interest income shrunk 15 per cent to 27.5 billion in the period under review, compared to Sh32.2 billion posted the same period in 2016. However, customer deposits grew from Sh331.4 billion in third quarter 2016 to reach Sh368 billion during the quarter under review, signaling 11 per cent growth. Consequently, the firm did lend Sh6 billion less during the quarter compared to Sh271.4billion it issued during the same quarter last year. Shareholders’ fund went up from Sh81.6 billion in 2016 to Sh90.1 billion during the quarter under review. The group’s non-risk assets grew by 37 per cent from Sh 93.1 billion to Sh127.7 billion with improved yields of 11.4 per cent up from 10 per cent in the corresponding quarter last year. Mwangi said the lender will divert more funds to Treasury bills going forward, as it considers government debt less risky and more profitable in the wake of the rate capping law even as he exuded confidence the law would “soon” be amended. During the quarter, Equity Bank ramped up its purchase of government debt, which paid off as interest earnings from government securities doubled to Sh10.4 billion, up from Sh5.8 billion posted same quarter last year.
