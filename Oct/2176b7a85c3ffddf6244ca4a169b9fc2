Motorists have been warned against speeding on the Nairobi-Nakuru highway. Lari OCPD Isaiah Odhiambo Monday said the rainy season has brought mist and fog covers that hampers drivers' visibility.  Speeding in such conditions would increase the likelihood of road crashes, he said. “A lot of accidents are being reported because of fog and misty conditions,” Odhiambo said. He warned reckless drivers that stern action would be taken against them. He was speaking at the scene of an accident in which a senior Kenya Forest Service
ranger died after his car collided head-on with a lorry in the Kinale area on Monday. Odhiambo confirmed that Elijah Mwaura, who is attached to Kamae Forest, died on his way to Kijabe AIC Hospital following the accident.
