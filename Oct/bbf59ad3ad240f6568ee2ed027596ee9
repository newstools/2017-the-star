Yesterday's election passed off relatively peacefully, albeit with a low turnout. There were some deaths and it remains regrettable that the police do not use plastic bullets that would eliminate unnecessary fatalities. Yesterday NASA supporters closed roads in Migori, Kisumu and parts of Busia. The opposition was boycotting the election and they wanted no-one to vote. Under the circumstances that was understandable. But today Kenya starts the business of getting back to normal. It is not acceptable for roads to be closed. If roads remain closed, local industries and consumers will soon suffer as products cannot be shipped in or out. It will also hurt our neighbours as international traffic could not reach Uganda via Kisumu yesterday. Therefore government will rightly need to ensure that all roads remain open to traffic. NASA is entitled to peacefully campaign for electoral reforms but this should not include cutting off parts of the country. If this happens, it will certainly precipitate violence. NASA leaders should make certain that their supporters do not block roads anywhere in the country.
