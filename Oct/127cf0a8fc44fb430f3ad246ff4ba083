The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission on Friday postponed elections in Nyanza constituencies which were delayed following insecurity in the region. The agency also temporarily put off polls in regions that were affected by increased insecurity on Thursday. They are Alego Usonga, Awendo, Bondo, Gem, Ugenya, Homa Bay Town, Kabondo, Karachuonyo, Kasipul, Kisumu Central, Kisumu East, Kisumu West, and Muhoroni. Ndhiwa, Suba North, Nyakach, Nyatike, Rongo, Rarieda, Suba South, Suna East, Suna West, Nyando, Seme, Uhuru, and Ugunja were affected. IEBC chair Wafula Chebukati said the commission will announce new dates for the affected areas after an assessment that the Saturday date is untenable. He said that elections in Fafi, Garissa county and five polling stations in Turkana will go on as planned for Saturday. "The elections excise in Fafi did not take place because of the rising cases of insecurity." "We have assured residents and our staff that security will be provided to them," Chebukati said. He said the affected regions have a total of 3,635 polling stations with a total of 1.7 million voters.  The chair said some staff hijacked, violently attacked and stopped from accessing polling stations.
