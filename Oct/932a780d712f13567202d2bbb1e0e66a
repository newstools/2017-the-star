Politicians who lost in the August 8 polls do not have the mandate to push for dialogue between the government and the opposition, some Jubilee legislators have said. The MPs from Kiambu and Nairobi counties on Sunday said those calling for dialogue on election reforms are “cowards looking for refuge in the opposition”. Kikuyu MP Kimani Ichung’wa said, “Raila challenged presidential election at the Supreme Court. The court ordered for fresh presidential polls and IEBC set the date. After people have prepared enough, he withdraws from the race leaving his supporters confused, and then you hear someone calling for dialogue.Where is this person headed?” Ichung’wa spoke at Lusigeti trading centre in his Kikuyu constituency, when he led other MPs to campaign for President Uhuru Kenyatta. They campaigned in Uthiru, Kinoo, Zambezi, Kerwa, Kiambaa, Kamangu and Nderi. He was accompanied by MPs James Githua (Kabete), John Kiarie (Dagoretti South), Yusuf Hassan (Kamukunji), Jude Njomo (Kiambu), James Gakuya (Embakasi North) and Kiambu deputy governor James Nyoro.
