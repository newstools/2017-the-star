A cleric who was found unconscious on Sunday by the roadside in Kinangop South is still recovering at Kijabe Hospital. Pastor Steve Kiragu’s hands and legs had been tied together to a flyover. The Methodist Church cleric from Kimende town was found by passersby, who reported to Magumu police. Resident John Wachira yesterday said he was wet all over the body, having been rained on throughout the Saturday night. “We didn’t know who he was. We reported to police, but some residents rushed him to Kijabe Hospital,” he said. “It appears he was kidnapped and beaten. He had marks on the neck.The people who did it must have wanted to strangle him to die.”  The residents said, however, that they have been not allowed to see him because he is undergoing specialised treatment.  Morris Kamau, Kiragu’s friend, said they visited the hospital, but were told they wait until doctors can allow.  “We hear he is still in a coma. We have not been able to see him, even though nurses advised us not to go because the doctor will advise us when to see him,” he said.  Lari police boss Isaiah Odhiambo said they have launched investigations.
