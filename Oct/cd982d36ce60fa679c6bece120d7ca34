The government has distributed relief food to IDPs who fled their homes due to Shabaab attacks in Lamu West and those in terror-prone areas in Basuba ward, Lamu East. Other vulnerable groups who received the food aid include residents living in areas worst hit by drought.  Many of the IDPs fled Shabaab killings in Jima, Pandanguo, Poromoko, Maleli and Nyongoro in July. Lamu county commissioner Gilbert Kitiyo yesterday said more than 2,000 bags of food — rice, maize, beans and fortified foods — had been received and distributed to those in Witu, Hindi, Bar’goni and Basuba. He said the Boni community in Basuba and Bar’goni and the more than 2,500 IDPs at Kastaka Kairu and Witu AIC camps were prioritised. We received 1,000 bags of rice, 400 bags of maize, 400 bags of beans and cartons of cooking fat and fortified foods,” Kitiyo said. He also assured them of security.
