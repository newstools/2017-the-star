Kenya Defence Forces womenâ€™s volleyball team will return to the national league in 2018 after a three-year absence in the top flight. The military side left the competitions at the end of the 2014 season. KDF will now have two teams (men and women) in the national league. The womenâ€™s outfit will be under the tutelage of former national team setter Elisha Aliwa. The team anchors their hopes to post great performances on their blend of experience and new blood in the squad. Veteran outside hitter Ednah Rotich, Jackline Barasa, Pamela Chepkurui and Monica Chepkorir will lead the pack. Rotich currently features for league side Kenya Commercial Bank.  The new blood comprises of former Nairobi Water and National under-23 team duo of Maurine Ekiru and Damaris Jepkorom and 2014 Cheptil Girlsâ€™ volleyball team alumni Joyce Jepkosgei. After Ulinziâ€™s unbeaten performances at the East Africa Community Military Games this year, team manager Alfred Chedotum is confident his side is ready to vie for the league honours. â€œCurrently the team is in good shape.  The players are all excited about playing in the league. We have been training all year and we are fit for the challenge,â€ said Chedotum. â€œWe had some issues that led to the disbandment of the women team three years ago but we are back,â€ he added. 2014 is the same year former Kenya international attacker and Ulinziâ€™s the late Doris Palangâ€™a passed on after a season-long absence for maternity. The return of Ulinzi will be a big boost to the national womenâ€™s league, which as currently constituted, lacks tight competition across the field. With only six teams, and four perennial participants in the playoffs, maybe Ulinzi will inject some kind of competition into the league.
