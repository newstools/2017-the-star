Enough security will be provided for everyone who turns out to vote tomorrow, Uasin Gishu county commissioner Abdi Hassan has said. “We are ready as security agencies and anyone who will try to interfere would meet with the full force of the law,” he said in his office in Eldoret yesterday. Hassan said police have carried out security drills in preparation and additional officers deployed. “We will ensure the voters, IEBC officials and other Kenyans are safe throughout the election,” he said. Hassan said those who will vote and those who plan to boycott the polls will be protected. This came even as the National Council of Churches of Kenya urged the government to ensure it provides adequate security. North Rift chairman Josphat Kimani said Kenyans in various parts of the country are fearful.  Elgeyo Marakwet county commissioner Fredrick Ndambuki said security teams are well prepared.  Jubilee officials, led by Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago, said the party has trained its agents.  Returning officer Jacktonne Nyonje said all returning officers, presiding officers and clerks have been trained and are all set for the election.
