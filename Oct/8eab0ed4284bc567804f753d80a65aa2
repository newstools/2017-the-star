Mr Price franchise in Kenya, owned by Deacons, is likely to be sold out to Mr Price Group Limited, 10 years after it started operations in this country. Considered for purchase by the group are Mr Price Home and Mr Price apparel brands. This follows an approval of negotiations on its sale by Deacons East Africa Plc board of directors. The move follows a recent proposal by South African-based retailer Mr Price Group Limited to purchase the brand subject to approval by shareholders and relevant regulatory authorities. The approvals will be done through a shareholdersâ€™ meeting to be convened once the sale agreement has been finalised. â€œIn the meantime, the shareholders of Deacons and other investors are advised to exercise caution when dealing in the shares of the company,â€ Deaconsâ€™ chief executive officer Muchiri Wahome said in a statement. The deal, if approved, will see the firm purchase and operate all the 11 Mr Price Home and Mr Price apparel stores in Kenya. While at that, the fashion retailer is expected to launch into the e-commerce space in the first quarter of 2018 to boost its revenue. â€œE-commerce is convenient and a younger customer who is effectively living life on his phone, it takes time to reach the kind of opportunity we are trying to get there and we believe it will be enormous,â€ Wahome said in a recent address to the media. This follows a 246.15 per cent increase in its losses in the first six months of 2017 to Sh180 million compared to Sh52 million in losses it made in the first half of 2016. Other brands managed by the retailer include Deacons, the F & F, Bossini, Adidas, 4 u 2, Truworths and Lifefitness.
