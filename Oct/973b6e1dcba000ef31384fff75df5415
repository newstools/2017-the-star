IEBC on Monday began distributing poll materials for Thursday's repeat presidential election in Kisii county. A spot check by The Star at the IEBC regional office revealed the materials were loaded into vehicles for dispatch to the county's nine constituencies. A poll agency official, who sought anonymity, said they are prepared for the election despite the NASA boycott calls. "We have started distributing election materials to various constituencies ready for the rerun," the official said. President Uhuru Kenyatta and NASA presidential flag bearer Raila Odinga will be battling it out for the 546,580 votes in the area. The two presidential candidates have been crisscrossing in the region to woo residents to support them. Raila has since called on Kenyans not to participate in the polls on grounds IEBC has failed to meet their demands. He is touring the region on Monday.

The President is expected to sign the controversial Election Bill that says, among other things, that the vice chair will be able to declare results in the event the chair is unable to perform their functions. Meanwhile, 13 MCAs allied to Jubilee from Kisii have urged Kenyans to ignore the boycott call. Minority Leader James Ondari led the MCAs who said that every Kenyan has a democratic right to participate in any election. Addressing the press, the leaders said if Raila is not interested in the polls, he should stop inciting his supporters to cause anarchy.
