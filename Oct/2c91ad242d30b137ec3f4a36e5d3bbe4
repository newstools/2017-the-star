The IEBC has rescheduled a meeting between the presidential candidates due to unknown reasons. "Today's 2.30pm meeting with presidential candidates has regrettably been rescheduled. We will update," IEBC said via Twitter on Thursday. The commission said they will set a new date after reaching an agreement with all parties. Jubilee Party leader Uhuru Kenyatta and NASA's Raila Odinga are among the candidates who were supposed to meet the electoral agency's chairman Wafula Chebukati to dialogue ahead of the October 26 vote. On Wednesday, the chair invited all the seven presidential candidates and their running mates to an urgent meeting. Others are Thirdway Alliance's Ekuru Aukot, Japheth Kaluyu, Michael Wainaina, Abduba Dida and Joe Nyagah. The chair had on Wednesday said the meeting, which concerns issues bordering on the fresh October 26 election, will start at 2.30 pm. This was after he cast aspersions on whether the current political environment favours a credible election.
