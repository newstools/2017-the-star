China's biggest political event, the Communist Party congress, has begun in Beijing under tight security. Party leader and Chinese president Xi Jinping is addressing more than 2,000 delegates in the capital. The closed-door summit, which takes place once every five years, determines who rules China and the country's direction for the next term. Xi, who became the leader in 2012, has been consolidating power and is expected to remain as party chief. The congress, which also decides on a roadmap for China for the next five years, is expected to finish next week. Shortly after the congress ends, the party is expected to unveil the new members of China's top decision-making body, the Politburo Standing Committee, who will steer the country. Mr Xi began his speech on Wednesday listing China's achievements during his term, and said socialism with Chinese characteristics had entered "a new era". He called on party members to "always share our fate with the people, always keep the better life for the people in mind". Xi also spoke about the success of his wide-reaching corruption crackdown within the party that has punished more than a million officials, report BBC correspondents in Beijing. Beijing is decked out in welcome banners and festive displays for the congress. However, the capital is also on high alert. Long lines were seen earlier this week at railway stations due to additional checks at transport hubs. The congress has also affected businesses, with some restaurants, gyms, nightclubs and karaoke bars reportedly shutting down due to tightened security rules, and accommodation-booking websites like Airbnb cancelling bookings in central Beijing.
