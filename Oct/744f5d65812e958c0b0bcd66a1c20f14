Nyali MP Mohamed Ali welcomed President Uhuru Kenyatta as Jubilee took campaigns to Mombasa on Monday. Ali who was elected as an independent candidate after losing in the ODM primaries is a vocal supporter of Opposition leader Raila Odinga. But he was spotted at a Jubilee rally in Mombasa on Monday, and at State House premises shortly after. "We are facing many serious problems in the constituency like poor drainage, lack of proper infrastructure and I as an independent candidate have vowed to work with the leadership that will help us solve the problems we face," the MP said. Sources had said Ali had defected to Jubilee after ODM filed a petition against his win on August 8. But in a statement to newsrooms, Ali clarified that he was welcoming Uhuru to his constituency. "As an Independent Member of Parliament, my responsibility is first and foremost to the people of Nyali, who elected me. "The people of this constituency need jobs, better healthcare and education for their children, and a hope for the future. As I did on the campaign trail, I say that I will work with all people whose core interest is to develop Nyali, and make this constituency the envy of this county." Ali, famously known for the Jicho Pevu TV series, garnered 26,798 votes against his closest challenger Said Abdalla, said to be Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho's cousin, who got 15,473 votes.
