The amended Election Laws are now undergoing public participation hearings. And then they will be compiled and presented to the National Assembly and the Senate on Tuesday. However, this process has gone on without the participation of the Opposition. It has also gone on despite requests from various people and authorities, both local and international, to halt or suspend it. They argue that it has bad timing, as it is not international best practice to amend election laws a jump ahead of the vote. And remember in this case we are talking about an unprecedented repeat Presidential election. The IEBC itself has requested that these amendments on grounds that that they are unnecessary and ill timed. Their timing is wrong and the motives behind them are unclear. Laws should be made with an eye on posterity and not emotion or political bias and shortsightedness. These laws could make or break the repeat election. Let the MPs do the right thing, in the long-term national interest.
