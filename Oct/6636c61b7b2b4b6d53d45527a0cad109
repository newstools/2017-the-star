The Media Council of Kenya on Thursday called for the cancellation of what it termed as 'sensational' live press conferences.  The council said that these are creating unnecessary tension and anxiety to members of the public. "Focus should now be on the different actors and the progress in the electoral process," acting CEO David Omwoyo said in a statement. "We need more voices of reason. The public is anxious."   This followed a scuffle between Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen and Mathare MP Anthony Oluoch. The two clashed during a live press conference at Panafric Hotel over a silly joke of someone buying the other tea.  The leaders exchanged bitter words after Murkomen insinuated that NASA MPs were lying to Kenyans. "We urge the media to cease all sensational live press conferences and focus on the electoral process," Omwoyo said. Read: NASA MPs chase Murkomen from Panafric hotel over 'cup of tea' remark
