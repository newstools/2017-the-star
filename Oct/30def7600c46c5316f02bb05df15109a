Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua has criticised NASA’s National Resistance Movement. He yesterday said it was wrong for NASA to announce it will mobilize its supporters to oppose President Uhuru Kenyatta’s government from today. “Nchi ya Kenya iko chini ya mabavu siyo ukoloni, hiyo ni kama armed resistance (Kenya is under a force, not colonialism. That is like an armed resistance),” Mutua said. He addressed the press after casting his vote at Mathatani Primary School polling station in Mavoko subcounty. Mutua warned NASA flagbearer Raila Odinga against turning Kenya into a war-torn country. “Do we want to be like Somalia, Southern Sudan and other war-torn countries? Kenyans can’t be refugees in their own country,” he said.
