Fida has strongly condemned incessant brutality and attacks by police officers on the pretext of calming riots and demonstrations across the country. The organisation cited the recent brutalisation of University of Nairobi students by police, saying it was inhuman and degrading treatment.  In a statement by chairperson Josephine Wambua-Mongâ€™are yesterday, FIDA threatened court action to end this violation of studentsâ€™ rights if IPOA, the Inspector General and DPP fail to take action. Fida was offering free legal representation to all victims of the violence. She said victims should visit the organisationâ€™s offices. Fida specifically took issue with the repeated invasion in the university premises and the unleashing of violence on students. â€œIt is disturbing that police officers are continuously allowed to invade universitiesâ€™ lecture rooms and halls of residence to attack students.Entering studentsâ€™ places of refuge is a clear indication of purposed atrocities by police officers,â€ added the satement. Fida also cited a similar attack that ocurred at St Peterâ€™s Awich Kidingo ECDE centre in Kisumu where children were teargased.
