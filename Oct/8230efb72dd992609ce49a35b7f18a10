The pre-trial conference for the election petition against Nyamira Governor John Nyagarama kicked off on Tuesday. Petitioner Walter Nyambati seeks to overturn the Governor's election and asked the court to secure election materials. But IEBC lawyer James Mamboleo argues that it is not possible to secure the KIEMS kits as they have been recalled for the October 26 repeat presidential polls. He said the materials were kept in Kisii and not Nyamira due to security concerns. Justice Aaron Makau said the matter will proceed to full hearing on October 5.
