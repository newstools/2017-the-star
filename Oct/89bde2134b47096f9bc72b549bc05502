Four MCAs have warned Nyandarua enforcement officers to respect residents and their property or else they will be ejected from office.  They spoke at Ol Kalou Stadium on Tuesday. Boda boda operators complained of harassment by the officials.  They said the officials terrorise them and break their motorcycles.  The operators said if the county government does not tame the officials â€œwe are going to lynch them and burn their pick-ups.â€  The MCAs were Kariuki Ngaruiya (nominated), Ken Mukira (Karau), Mburu Githinji (Rurii) and Joseph Kariuki (nominated).
