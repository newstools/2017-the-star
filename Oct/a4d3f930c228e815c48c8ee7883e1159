Kajiado could soon put its days of poverty behind it if a gas accidentally discovered in one of its villages turns out to be methane. The gas was discovered by hydro-geologists who were sinking a borehole in Inkokirdingâ€™a village, Kajiado county. It has not been formally verified by experts from the Ministry of Mines and Geology. The team of hydro-geologists, led by Eng Peter Supeyio, was working on a borehole in a farm belonging to Joseph Melonye ole Nakeel on Monday. They had left for the day when farmhands heard loud noises coming from the site of the borehole. Employee Sammy Ruto, out of curiosity, lit a matchstick and threw to the gas emission and a big fire exploded. When the Star visited the farm, off the Isinya-Kiserian road in Kajiado West constituency on Thursday morning, blue flames could be seen coming out of the boreholeâ€™s metal lid. The farm is in Kipeto and lies on 70 acres. It is marked as wildlife conservancy. Supeyio, a former employee of the Water Resource Management Authority, told the Star he has more than 30 years of experience in hydro-geology, but has never heard of such a discovery in Kajiado. â€œThis was a surprise to me because all I know is that carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide are common in Kajiado. Methane, as far as I know, is found in the Kenyan North Coast around Lamu and Malindi,â€ he said. Kajiado Deputy Governor Martin Moshisho said the discovery is a great blessing for the county. Most of the county is semiarid and the local Maasai communities are pastoralists who sorely depend on livestock for food and upkeep. â€œThis is wealth, and we are striving to work with the national government on this one. Right now we have contacted relevant government offices so that further research is done in earnest to establish how much gas is underground,â€ he said on the phone.
