University of Nairobi VC Peter Mbithi has asked postgraduate students in Kisumu and Mombasa to resume classes immediately. Via Twitter on Thursday, theVice Chancellor said classes should also resume for all open and distance learning students. The announcement comes days after the institution was closed indefinitely following protests by students and insecurity fears. Amid nationwide concern about attacks by police, students called for Mbithi's resignation saying he did not speak for them. Videos emerged of officers believed to be in the GSU hurling students out of their premises, frogmarching and beating them. This reportedly took place after some students protested the arrest of Embakasi East MP Babu Owino who once served as student union leader.
