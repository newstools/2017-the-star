The state and the European Union will spend Sh20 million to provide food for malnourished children and livestock feed in Laikipia county. Of that amount, Sh17 million will buy 7,800 bags of food pellets for animals in the worst-affected areas. Some Sh2.8 million will feed 2,000 malnourished children under the age of five. The National Drought Management Authority is partnering with the EU.  County coordinator Henry Mustapha yesterday said 13,000 livestock will benefit. “Following the start of rains in the region, livestock will still be weak and emaciated because of lack of pasture,” Mustapha said. He said 50kg bags will be distributed for one and a half months. Each animal will be fed one kilo per day. Mustapha also said health workers will visit malnourished children.  “We have identified 68 spots countywide where the health workers will be checking on children. Some will be given food while others might be admitted in hospitals” said Mustapha. Last month, the government estimated Sh2.5 billion is required to deal with the food shortage up to January next year. Of the Sh2.5 billion, at least Sh381 million should be used to upgrade health and nutritional programmes in at least the 15 worst-hit counties, the drought authority says.
