Resolution Impala Saracens have been handed a bye to the semifinals of the floodlight tournament which starts on November 4. Last years losing finalists KCB take on Resolution Kisii in the first of the quarterfinals with Strathmore Leos taking on Mean Machine in the second fixture. Quins will complete match day one’s programme with a mouthwatering clash against Homeboyz RFC . The winner of this clash will face the winner of the KCB-Kisii clash with the Sarries laying in wait for the winners of the Strathmore-Machine clash in the semis a week later at the Impala Club. The semifinal are slated for November 11th with the final set for November 18. This year, the Impala Floodlit will feature GIR (age-grade), women’s, universities and all senior teams in the Kenya Rugby. There will be no high school category since most of the schools will have closed by then. The hosts are the defending champions after edging out KCB 33-32 last year. Laiser Hill Academy beat Ofafa Jericho to win the schools category, Menengai Oilers picked the varsities title with a 24-16 win over Blak Blad II while Homeboyz won the Plate after beating Strathmore Leos 22-18.
