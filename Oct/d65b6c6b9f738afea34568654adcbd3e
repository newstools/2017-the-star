Nairobi matatu owners have hired traffic marshals to control their fleet in a self-regulatory move to decongest the city and avoid an imminent ban. Governor Mike Sonko had last month threatened to kick out matatus from the central business district citing congestion. MOA chairman Simon Kimutai on Wednesday unveiled a team of 100 marshals who will man various terminals to ensure drivers adhere to traffic regulations. He said the marshals will be deployed according to the needs of various saccos operating in the city centre. "We want to enhance self-regulation as was asked by the governor so that our matatus are not banned from the CBD," Kimutai said. On Thursday, the association of matatus also hired another 100 marshals to man their stages for free traffic flow. â€œWe want to prove that we can regulate ourselves. The next 30 days will decide whether we get banned from the CBD of not,â€ the association's vice chairman Wambugu Kanaru said. Sonko had initially announced an indefinite ban on the matatus from September 20, only to postpone its implementation by a month to allow the operators prove if they can self-regulate. The governor accused the public service vehicles of obstructing traffic by making unnecessary u-turns, picking and dropping passengers at non-designated areas and causing nuisance by playing loud music and hooting. Kimutai denied claims that they had hired the marshals to counter the county's planned deployment of 1,000 others to enforce traffic regulations in the city. He said they do not want their crews involved in any mess in the city centre. â€œWe want to avoid situations where city askaris or police arrest our people. Such cases belong to the past," he said. He asked them to be cautious and to remain vigilant on the road.
