President Uhuru Kenyatta on Monday met IEBC Chairman Wafula Chebukati at Harambee House. Uhuru had said he was ready to meet the IEBC chairman adding that he has no demands ahead of the polls. "My door is open. If Chebukati has something he wants discussed, he is free to come and we talk over a cup of tea," he told Citizen TV on Sunday. After the meeting, Uhuru said he is ready for the elections and has no demands on IEBC, other than the electoral body meeting its obligation of conducting fresh presidential elections on October 26 as ordered by the Supreme Court. “We made it clear that we have no demands or conditions on this subject. We have made funds available for the IEBC to do its job. Now they really should deliver,” he said. “We only insist that elections be held on October 26, that’s the timeline set by the IEBC in terms of conditions set in the annulment of the Aug 8 elections." Last week, Chebukati, in a stark message to political leaders, said he could not guarantee a credible vote under present conditions, and demanded Uhuru and NASA leader Raila Odinga meet him for talks.
