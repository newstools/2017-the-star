The University of Nairobi Senate yesterday closed the institution indefinitely following violence that rocked it on Thursday. Students rioted to protest the arrest of former student leader and Embakasi East MP Babu Owino.  The MP was arrested for allegedly referring to President Uhuru Kenyatta in derogatory terms. He was rearrested after the court granted him bail and charged with a separate count, leading to the protests by the students.  He was a student leader at UoN for many years. Police are accused of using excessive violence to subdue the students, including flushing some out of hostels and beating them. Students yesterday condemned Vice Chancellor Peter Mbithi for closing the institution. They pledged to carry on with protests once UoN reopens â€” until their concerns are addressed. The VC, through Twitter, said the university had been shut and students given until 9am to vacate the campus. â€œThe senate has closed the university with immediate effect due to deteriorating security situation,â€ he said without elaboration. The students, carrying their belongings, started leaving as early as 7am. â€œFirst, there was denial students had been brutalised and injured. After we put pressure to know why our comrades were beaten up, we saw a well-choreographed script by IPOA, the university and police to discredit and downplay everything that happened. This angered students,â€ Ascon Kamili, a SONU leader said. â€œClosing is meant to cover up brutality and defeat justice. When the injured leave, evidence will be lost,â€ he added. Joel Mabonga, IPOAâ€™s CEO, on yesterday urged the 26 students injured by police not to leave until they record a statement with them.  â€œRecording statements will assist fast-tracking investigations,â€ he said. Students said the university was trying to divide students and leaders along ethnic and political lines. Neither Mbithi nor corporate communications head John Orindi responded to calls or texts from the Star seeking comment.
