Youths have been urged not to get drunk today, lest they don’t turn up to vote tomorrow or end up choosing the ‘wrong’ leader in their state of drunkenness. Speaking in Kiambu yesterday, Gladys Chania, a psychologist and politician, said alcoholism among the youth is high. “It is time we make a major decision for the country’s leadership and we need sober minds to do so. I urge the youth to abstain from alcohol and any other addictive substances that will hinder them from voting because every vote counts,” she said. Chania said alcohol abuse is rife in Kiambu. “People should unite to fight the vice and leaders should focus on giving hope to the community for a better tomorrow,” she said. Opposition chief Raila Odinga has previously urged NASA supporters to abstain from sex on the eve of elections. Last week, more than 1,000 women from Nyeri county said they will abstain on Election Eve. Some youths have in the past failed to turn up to vote after getting drunk. Chania also called on the youth to go back to their daily chores after voting and wait for the outcome of the election results, adding that they should not cause chaos. She asked the youth to reelect President Uhuru Kenyatta, adding he is the better choice and has proven to have the youth agenda at heart. Chania said leaders should sensitize voters on the importance of voting.
