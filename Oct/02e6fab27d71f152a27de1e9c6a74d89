Relative calm has been restored on the border of Kericho and Muhoroni towns, following the recent attacks among youths from opposing communities. Muhoroni deputy county commissioner Kipkech Lotiatia said the security committee teams from both towns moved with speed to end attacks following the repeat presidential election. He spoke during a public forum with local leaders and the youths on the Muhoroni Bridge on Friday. Lotiatia said gangs took advantage of protests to infiltrate the region and rob motorists on the Kericho-Kisumu highway. He urged the warring communities to put aside their differences and promote peaceful coexistence. Lotiatia urged the youths not to barricade major highways while expressing their displeasure against the repeat election, adding infrastructure is key to economic growth.
