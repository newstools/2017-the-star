Tanzanian singere artiste TID has announced that he'll be vying the Kinondoni MP seat come in the next Tanzania's general election in 2020, with the aim of defeating the current MP, Maulid Mtulia. Speaking to a radio station in Tanzania, TID revealed that the main reason as to why he wants to vie for the seat is because the current MP has not fulfilled his promises or rather lived up to what he told the people of Kinondoni when he was campaigning for the said seat. TID claims that he's sure he will do a better job because he understands the challenges facing Kinondoni because he was born and raised there. He further stated that if he's given the chance to lead the people of the area, he'll make sure he resolves all the issues affecting the area especially the issue with drug abuse. It will be noted that early this year, TID was among the many artistes who were arrested and questioned in regards to drug abuse.
