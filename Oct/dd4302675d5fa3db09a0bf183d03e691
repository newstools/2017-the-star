Kitutu Masaba MP Shadrack Mose (pictured) wants a petitioner challenging his victory barred from introducing new evidence. Through lawyer Morara Omoke, the MP told Justice Makau not to allow evidence on alleged ungazetted polling stations in the constituency. Omoke argued the evidence was filed outside the legal timeline of 28 days. Voter Justus Omiti is challenging Moseâ€™s win. Lawyer Jackson Awele, for the petitioner, said there is no provision that bars the petitioner from filing documents deemed relevant to the case. The application ruling will be on October 31.
