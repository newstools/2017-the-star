Jazz music bands can be quite resourceful. They are tasked with bringing a much-needed sound necessary to soothe and stimulate — and so has been the case with the Kenyan-based jazz collective Nairobi Horns Project. The all-male trio, comprising trombonist Victor Kinama, saxophonist Mokua Rabai and trumpeter Mackinlay Musembi, is a powerful ensemble that has exhibited wide-reaching projects. Inarguably, the diversity of their catalog is undeniable. Since they came together, they have been on a progressive creative verge, and their compositional range has been tremendous. Their compatibility, too, has been imperative to their ecstatic, horn-blowing sound. If you’ve been fortunate to catch a live performance by the jazz collective, you’ll certainly agree that the trio has made a reputation for themselves. Whether backed by their potent band or not, they have not lived short of their fans’ expectations. Modern jazz fans have a right to rank the trio among the top performers. In the recent past, they’ve been the suavest improvisers, thrilling enthusiasts in festivals and concerts in the country. They’ve shared several stages with some of the biggest names in jazz, and they done so with great artistic passion. The boy band has been transposing popular local hits into delightful jazz tunes, as well as providing listeners with well-crafted compositions. They’ve ventured into the market of contemporary music and managed to build a strong following among the millennials, who have not been keen jazz followers.   All told, the sincerity of the group can be felt in every blow. Nairobi Horns Project, steeped as they are in jazz, bring forth a sound in which listeners have found comfort and inspiration. They have simply been outstanding.
