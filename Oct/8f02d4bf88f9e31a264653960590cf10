The government has distributed relief food to disadvantaged groups in Narok North subcounty.  Narok deputy county commissioner Ronald Mwiwawi yesterday said the government provided 577 bags of maize (90kg each), 482 bags of beans (90kg each), 98 bags of rice (50kg each), 131 cartons of cooking oil and 40 bales of porridge flour.  The beneficiaries were mainly freedom fighters, persons living with disability, children’s homes and the Muslim communities.  Mwiwawi said the government recognises freedom fighters as major players in the growth of the country, hence will support them in every way so they can lead a comfortable lives.  He said Siyiapei, PCEA Boys’ Home and House of Love Children’s Home benefited because many children escape to rescue centres in fear of retrogressive cultural practices in their homes.
