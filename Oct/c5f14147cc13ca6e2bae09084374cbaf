Kenya and Uganda have partnered in vaccinating cattle to control the spread of contagious bovine pleurapneumonia across the border. The disease is a contagious bacterial disease that afflicts the lungs of cattle and buffaloes. The drive targets more than 300,000 animals from the two countries. The Kenyan government has donated 64,000 vaccine doses, while Uganda has donated 15,000. The regions benefitting from the drive in Uganda are Chepsukunya, Abong’oi, Karita, Kiriki, Asiokanion, Lokales and Ng’orina in Uganda. In Kenya last week, more than 60,000 animals were vaccinated in Konyau, Kanyerus, Aslong and Alale in North Pokot. West Pokot Governor John Lonyangapuo on Thursday said his government will partner with the national government to ensure the vaccines are increased to more than 100,000 doses to ensure all animals are vaccinated. Amdat Governor Francis Kiyonga in Uganda said 90 per cent of the population on the border depends on livestock. He said most of the animals are sold in Kenya. “We sell more than  1000 animals per week in Nairobi,” Kiyonga said.
