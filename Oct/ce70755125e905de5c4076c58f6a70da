Unbeaten Malkia Strikers face off with either hosts Cameroon or Egypt in one of semis lined up for this evening as the women’s African Cup Nation-cum-World Championship qualifiers hit fever pitch at the Palais des Sports Indoor Arena. Kenya wrapped up their preliminary stage on a high note with 3-0 (25-17,25-21,25-16) win over Tunisia on Tuesday to finish top of Pool ‘B’ with 12 points. The match pitting Cameroon and Egypt last evening was to determine Kenyan opponents. The other semi-final will pit whoever finishes first in Pool ‘A’ and the vastly improved Senegal, who finished second behind Kenya with six points. Senegal were set to play Nigeria in their last Pool ‘B’ match yesterday. However, Kenyans are crossing their fingers ahead of semis. Egypt denied them chance to proceed to Olympic Games and they will no doubt be seeking revenge if they happen to meet. The hosts are also no pushovers, having defied all odds last year to beat favourites Egypt for the sole Olympic Games slot. At the same time, Cameroon featured for the first time in this year’s FIVB World Grand Prix Group 3 and although they recorded dismal performance, they will draw inspiration from the fact they sit above Kenya and Egypt FIVB world ranking. Cameroon are placed 18 with 47 points ahead of Kenya, who sit in the 33rd position with 17 points and Egypt at position 40 with 13 points. Team coach Japheth Munala said real work begins now. Munala lauded the players for maintaining 100 percent performance in group stages and called on his charges to extend the good form going forward. “These sides-Cameroon and Egypt are tough sides and whoever we will play we have to go an extra mile. However, I am glad each and every player has been given a chance to play and they have all lived up risen up to the occasion,” said Munala who double up as Kenya Pipeline coach.  He added: “We will put our best foot forward and hopefully we proceed to the finals and retain the title.”
