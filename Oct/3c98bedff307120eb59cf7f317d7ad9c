Kilifi North MP Owen Baya yesterday said his Secession Bill does not reflect the Mombasa Republican Council’s agenda. Baya also said the move to table the Bill was not influenced by the MRC. Speaking in his office in Kilifi Baya said he will not relent in his quest for the Coast region to gain autonomy from the rest of Kenya. This despite opposition from various quarters. This comes at a time when some opposition thinkers and supporters say secession is the only answer to Kenya tribal and regional divisions and lack of political inclusion. On Saturday, the Chief of Defence Forces GenSamson Mwathethe warned that secession calls have far- reaching effects and should not be discussed at such a sensitive time during an election crisis. “The Bill is not in way related to the MRC. Though the MRC had a similar call, they were not using the right channels. I don’t believe in violence. The Constitution gives me the power to lobby for the region to manage its own affairs,” Baya said. He said the MRC was being used by regional tycoons with their own agenda, far from waht the group wanted. The MRC last week urged Coast leaders to engage them in championing the secession call. “This cause started a long time ago and yielded no fruit. I am sure this time, we will have our say. I will talk to the President and lobby MPs to make sure the Bill sails through,” he said. “In the National Assembly, I will bank on the silent majority. Some MPs don’t express their views openly but they can express them in voting. I have no fear because the Bill is informed by the Constitution,” he said. When the secession debate was brought to the fore by the MRC, it gained massive support but most political leaders did not support it because it was calling for a no vote in the region.
