Busia woman representative Florence Mutua yesterday urged NASA supporters to stay at home tomorrow.  "Our presidential candidate Raila OdingaÂ  has withdrawn from the race although the
IEBC has defiantly retained his name on
the ballot. It will a Jubilee election and others but not NASA's," she said. Mutua spoke to the Star in Busia. "Those who will purport to
block those who want to go and cast their votes will be Jubilee goons," she said. County commissioner Michael ole Tialal said the election will take place as scheduled.  "Enough security will be deployed to deal with those
who will try to scare others from going to exercise their constitutional rights across the county,"
he said. Deputy Governor
Moses Mulomi urged NASA supporters not to do anything illegal.
