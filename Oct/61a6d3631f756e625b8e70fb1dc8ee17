Nyamira Governor John Nyagarama has said his security was withdrawn because of his renewed campaigns for NASA leader Raila Odinga. “Without explanation, the government has withdrawn the few security officers provided to offer me and my family security and protection, a service that the other 46 governors and senior public officials continue to enjoy,” he said. Nyagarama addressed journalists at his home on Wednesday afternoon. He said he will not be cowed. “Despite this setback, I will continue to serve the people of the great county of Nyamira, whether the government provides me with security or not,” Nyagarama said. “If anything happens to me, the first people to be blamed are those who have unfairly exposed me to the great risk as I exercise my duties and responsibilities.”
