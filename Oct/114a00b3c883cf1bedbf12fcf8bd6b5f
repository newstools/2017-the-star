Seven counties in the Rift Valley are facing drought and food shortage. Livestock have died and an estimated 400,000 people are in need of food aid. Rift Valley regional coordinator Wanyama Musiambo yesterday said the government is carrying out a quick survey to establish the number of families who need food and other assistance. He said the drought has devastated parts of Turkana, West Pokot, Baringo, Samburu, Narok, Kajiado and Laikipia counties. â€œWe have directed chiefs and their assistants to quickly map out the affected areas. We will send help to avert further loses of livestock,â€ Musiambo told the Star on the phone yesterday. He said the drought is worsening in some areas.  The government will supply fodder and water. It will also buy livestock from farmers to minimise their losses. Musiambo said the state has set aside enough resources to cater for the affected residents.  He said the government will ensure people do not die as a result of the drought caused by shortage of rain. Meanwhile, West Pokot Governor John Lonyangapuo has commissioned a free programme to vaccinate livestock against the contagious Borine Pleura Pneumonia.   He launched the drive at at Kanyerus in Suam Ward, Kacheliba constituency.  The week-long campaign will be done in North Pokot along the border with Uganda and Turkana county. â€œWe are targeting 30,000 animals. I urge the national government to boost our kitty with additional funding. We want to vaccinate the animals to prevent the spread of the disease,â€ Lonyangapuo said. On February 10, the state announced a national drought emergency, with 23 of 47 counties affected.
