Harambee Stars jetted out yesterday for their double friendly matches in Asia, where they are expected to play Iraq and Thailand on Thursday and Sunday respectively.  Stars, under the stewardship of Stanley Okumbi, will have to do without the services of inspirational skipper Victor Wanyama who is nursing a re-occurring injury with his English side, Tottenham Hotspurs. Stars will also be without Brian Mandela and Ayub Timbe who are out injured. Okumbi who named a contingent of local players drawn from the SportPesa Premier League will, however, receive a boost from the international players who are expected to link up with the rest in Iraq after completing their weekend duties with their respective employers. With the current fixture congestion witnessed in the local league and the long flights to Asia, Stars may be hitched by fatigue since there will be little time to rest and adapt to the climate demands of Iraqâ€”a situation that may affect their input on the pitch. The hitch may turn out to be an advantage to their hosts who have a single worry of the physical prowess of the East African country.  According to Football Kenya Federation (FKF) communication officer, Barry Otieno, the squad named last month remained unchanged as there were no injuries reported. â€œThe squad has not changed since we did not have injury concerns. The local-based players left yesterday at 11:00pm and we hope the international players will link with the rest in Iraq.â€
