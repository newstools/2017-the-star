Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka has
asked security agencies in Bungoma to arrest the authors of leaflets warning residents not to vote tomorrow. The leaflets have been circulated in major towns and residents are scared of attacks.  Speaking to the Star on the phone yesterday, he
said Bungoma "does not belong to anyone who wakes up and gives orders the way he
want". Lusaka said every Kenyan is free to participate
in the fresh presidential election. He said those who threaten voters will not be spared. ''We are warning those who are
planning to disrupt the election that they will be dealt with, so let them
remain at home if they don't want to participate,'' he said. Lusaka urged residents to turn
up in large numbers and vote, saying there will be enough security. Police commander Charles
Munyoli and the DCI have launched investigations.
 ''We received this information
yesterday night that some leaflets were being circulated across the county
warning people against going to vote on Thursday. We are closely monitoring the
matter and we will soon net the culprits,'' Munyoli said. He said it is unlawful for anyone to threaten any citizen and those found
will face the full force of law . Munyoli said the
county security committee has put in place measures to ensure that there was
enough security on voting day.
