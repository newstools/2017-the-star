The ugly face of defiance came to the fore yesterday with acting Interior CS Fred Matiang’i being the target during an impromptu visit to a school in Kawangware. There has been violence in the area for four days. Matiang’i escaped the wrath of the rioters suspected to be NASA supporters after his security detail whisked him out of Gatina Primary School. He had visited ahead of the start of the KCPE exams today. His arrival was not immediately known, but later, word went round he was at the school and rioters gathered and lay ambush outside. The CS’s security detail outwitted the youths and removed the ministerial flag from his car. Matiang’i had finished speaking to the candidates, when the youths started throwing stones into the school compound. Police fired tear gas to disperse the crowd. One of the cars in Matiang’i’s entourage was stoned and its windscreen shattered. Some reporters’ vehicles were also stoned on suspicion of being part of Matiangi’s escort team. “His [Matiangi’s] handlers were very clever. They chose to change direction and go back through Lavington. Otherwise, if he continued towards Congo, he would have been lynched or police would have killed many to save him,” a resident said. He continued, “The NASA supporters turned to other vehicles after they failed to identify the CS’s car.” The resident said it was wrong for him to go to Kawangware, knowing his ties with the Jubilee government. Residents said Matiang’i’s links with the Jubilee government were the reason he was attacked. “Anyone associated with Uhuru [President Uhuru Kenyatta] and Jubilee is our enemy and we will not spare them,” Daniel Momanyi said. Ethnic hatred, heightened tension and anxiety was rife in the area as Jubilee supporters waited for IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati to announce the winner.
