Kenyan millers will have access to technical and operational assistance worth Sh1 billion that will see the country partner with global food-processing firms. The partnership between non-profit international development organisation TechnoServe, non-profit industry consortium Partners in Food Solutions and Cereal Millers Association is set to improve the capacity of Kenyan cereals manufacturers to fortify maize and wheat flour with important nutrients. The initiative spearheaded by the Strengthening African Processors on Fortified Foods programme in Kenya, Nigeria and Tanzania, supported by a $10 million grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, will enhance efficiency, competitiveness, profitability of the members of the cereals association. “The SAPFF programme is a holistic approach to increasing nutritious food availability by addressing challenges that millers face in the areas of efficiency, sourcing and capacity, which can complicate their efforts to improve food fortification,” SAPFF director Rizwan Yusufali said in a statement. Food fortification has been widely identified as a cost-effective strategy for addressing micronutrient malnutrition at scale. In Kenya, more than one in four children under the age of five is stunted, with poor nutrition a prime factor in nearly a third of deaths of children under five. “CMA welcomes this initiative under the SAPFF, as it will not only boost the processing capacities of our members but go a long way towards giving Kenyans access to healthier and more nutritious foods,” said Nick Hutchinson,” Cereal Millers Association chairman in a statement. The SAPFF programme will enable CMA members access expertise from companies under the PFS consortium including General Mills, Cargill, Bühler, Ardent Mills, The Hershey Company and DSM.
