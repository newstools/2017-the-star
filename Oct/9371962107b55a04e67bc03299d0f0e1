A section of members of the Luhya community living in Mombasa have decamped from NASA saying they will support President Uhuru Kenyatta's reelection bid. They said they were unhappy with NASA leader Raila Odinga for pushing to 'sacrifice their son’ - IEBC chief executive Ezra Chiloba - for election blunders. Raila has called for daily demonstrations to push out Chiloba and force reforms at the electoral commission. “We do not support the anti-IEBC demos because Chiloba is our son," Josephat Makhoha said. Makhoha spoke after leading the Luhya delegation at a meeting at Tudor Day secondary school on Monday. Mombasa ANC youth chairman Kelvin Lunani dismissed the group saying they had been bought off by Jubilee. "It is not surprising to hear them speak that way because they have been bribed to shift allegiance," Lunani said. He said the community is firmly behind NASA and will stick with Raila. Makhoha denied that they were bought.
