A section of NASA MPs yesterday said the decision by the IEBC to postpone the election in the Nyanza region amounted to ethnic profiling. The MPs, led by Suna East Mohamed Junet, addressed the press at Panafric Hotel, Nairobi. They claimed IEBC chief executive Ezra Chiloba was interfering with the repeat presidential election, yet he had said he was on leave. Junet said Chiloba made several calls to IEBC officials in the counties to give them directions on how to conduct the presidential election. "We are also concerned by the decision by the commission to postpone elections in parts of Nyanza to create an impression there
was voting in other parts of the country. This decision amounts to
ethnic profiling, which is discriminatory and unconstitutional," Junet said.  He was accompanied by Dan Maanzo (Makueni) and Anthony Oluoch (Mathare). "Information that has come to our knowledge is to the effect that the CEO of the commission, despite having gone on leave ostensibly, has since made a number of calls to IEBC county coordinators, especially in NASA strongholds, asking them to ensure to open up tallying centres and manufacture results." The MPs claimed no voting went on in more than 60 per cent of the country.
