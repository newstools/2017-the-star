Chief Justice David Maraga yesterday voted at Bosose Primary School in West Mugirango constituency, Nyamira county.  He arrived at the polling station at 1pm accompanied by his wife, Eucabeth. Nyamira woman representative Jerusha Momanyi joined the two at the polling station.  Voting went on well, despite low voter turnout. Maraga did not, however, comment about the election.  “I can’t comment on the election or answer questions on the same. All I can say is that I have voted. That is all,” he said.  Voting started early in the morning. Clerks in some stations were idle as many voters stayed away.  Some residents, who did not want to vote, gathered and watched what was going on from afar. No disruptions were observed. Many businesses closed. NASA urged residents to boycott the rerun. It said results of the repeat poll had been predetermined.
