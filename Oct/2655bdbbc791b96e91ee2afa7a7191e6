The Tower Sacco Society wants to partner with the Nyandarua government to promote growth. Chairman John Gitundu said with the financial muscle and experience the sacco has, it will assist Governor Francis Kimemia to educate the youth on savings and credit. "We expect to work with the county government in promoting the livelihoods of the people of Nyandarua," he said The sacco also said it can assist the Nyandarua government to collect levies, saying it has presence in every corner of the county. Of the Sacco's 17 branches 11 are in Nyandarua. Other branches are in Nakuru, Gilgil, Maralal, Naivasha, Nyahururu and Wiyumiririe in Laikipia. The sacco is also planning to open a satellite branch in Mtwapa, Mombasa county, and in Rumuruti, Laikipia county. "It is easy and convenient for the government to reach every corner through Tower Sacco," he said The sacco was registered on September15, 1976, to serve primary school teachers. It started operating in 1977, when the first loans were given to members. Currently, it is classified under the fastest growing sacco with membership drawn from all sectors, including government ministries, Kenyans in the diaspora, the Teachers Service Commission, farmers, boda boda riders and police officers.
