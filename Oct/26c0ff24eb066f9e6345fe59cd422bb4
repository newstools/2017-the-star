The Garissa government will implement an ambitious County Integrated Development Plan for the next five years. Speaking at a forum to review the previous CIDP and plan the 2018-22 blueprint, Deputy Governor Abdi Dagane said projects will factor in the county’s main needs. He said the previous CIDP was not implemented because of a myriad of challenges, including lack of public participation. “We want the plan to include tarmacking roads in different parts of the county,” Dagane said. The forum was organised under the Kenya Resilient Arid Lands in Partnership for Integration Development programme. Programme officer Shirwaa Noord, county heads of departments, executives, the county commissioner and the speaker attended the function. UNHCR head of operations Jean Bosco Rushatsi said the agency is keen on helping the community and protect ing refugees in camps. He said the UN is planning to build a technical college at Alinjugur, where its sub-office was recently closed. Rushatsi said refugees have contributed to deforestation, but added his organisation is working with Unep to resolve the issue. cut in food rations Early this month, the UN World Food Programme announced it would cut food rations by 30 per cent for more than 400,000 refugees living in camps in Kenya due to insufficient funding.
