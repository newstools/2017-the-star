Kirinyaga deputy governor Peter Ndambiri has today flagged off over 20 branded Jubilee vehicles for Uhuruto campaigns in the County. The vehicles all branded in Jubilee colours made processions along the busy Kutus/Samson corner road bringing the busy traffic to a standstill. Speaking to press after flagging off the caravan, Ndambiri said they will vigorously campaign for Uhuru to win the October 26 polls. He accused NASA of engaging in violence through their weekly demonstrations which he noted have negatively affected the economy of the country. He said Friday's demonstration clearly saws that NASA itâ€™s only interested in violence and despondency. One man was allegedly shot dead during the Anti-IEBC protests. In Kisumu, rowdy youths looted a supermarket and assaulted several workes.

The opposition said it will hold the protests at the electoral agency headquarters on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. But Ndambiri termed the plan to increase demonstrations as a waste of time since nothing will change in the preparation for the election. He said that its now clear NASA presidential candidate doesnâ€™t want to face President Uhuru Kenyatta again on the ballot as he knows that he will suffer a humiliating defeat. His sentiments are echoed by Linnet Wanjiru a nominated MCA Kirinyaga county assembly who described the ongoing NASA demonstrations as unfortunate.
