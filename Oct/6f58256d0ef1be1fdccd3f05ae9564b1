Lamu county leaders are concerned the political temperatures in the country are undermining development. Speaking in Lamu yesterday, Senator Anwar Loitiptip and woman representative Ruweida Obo said the unpredictability was dragging  downthe county’s development agenda. Counties are yet to receive their budget allocation from the state. Many functions have either slowed or may grind to a halt. Poverty is likely to increase because the economy is hurt, they said. Projects in many counties cannot take off because of uncertainty.  Loitiptip said there are more idle youth because there are no jobs. “Kenyans need to be vigilant and reject leaders who want to drag us down,” thsenator said.  Obo said many key sectors are slowly declining due to the political situation that has lasted close to a year. She urged Kenyans to accept the results of the repeat presidential poll.
