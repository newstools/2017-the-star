NASA supporters in Kisumu
resumed their anti-IEBC protests yesterday as alliance leaders maintained no
election will be held in the area.  Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o, Deputy Governor Mathews Owili,
MPs Onyango K’Oyoo (Muhoroni), Fred Ouda (Kisumu Central), Jared Okello (Nyando) and Kisumu speaker Onyango Oloo led the protests.  Also present were MCAs. The leaders said they will
mobilise opposition supporters in the county to boycott voting if the NASA’s demands are not met. Nyong’o said he has been in the
struggle for the Second Liberation for 37 years and will not give up as the
demonstrations will result in change. He said the IEBC must not continue with the election, saying it was not planned according to the Constitution. “Let the commission call off the exercise until such as a time when proper
reforms are made to guarantee the wishes of the citizens,” the governor said.
