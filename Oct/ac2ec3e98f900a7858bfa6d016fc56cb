Authorities are investigating the origins of illegal and secretive devices that young people are using to get high in drug-free zones such as schools.  The National Authority for the Campaign Against Alcohol and Drug Abuse said the vapour and shisha pens are now being used to deliver drugs such as marijuana.  “This type of shisha is electronically charged at home and has a refiller. They are usually imported from China and are sold in Kenyan towns,” George Karisa, the Nacada coast regional manager, said.  Karisa warned the pens are now being sold to pupils in lower primary. Other pupils told Nacada officers they got the pens from their parents.  “Shisha hookers are now finding their way into our schools. Children can carry them from home as school pens and when they are free they start puffing,” Karisa said.  One student said devices hide the scent so well he was able to smoke bhang even in class. Karisa advises authorities to ensure the devices are not sold near schools.  “There is need to have frequent parents meetings to sensitise them on the new trends of drugs,” he said.  Most vapouriser devices resemble fountain pens, but they contain no ink and have nothing to do with writing.  They are prefilled with fruity liquid, but it is possible to refill them with marijuana.  The devices are sold in pubs and through Facebook and many have a USB port and adapter so their batteries can be recharged through a laptop.  Users press the fire button, causing the device to heat the element and vapourise. Tobacco control advocates are already taking action. Nairobi City public health officer Antony Muthemba said he has sensitised the management of several schools to be on the lookout.
