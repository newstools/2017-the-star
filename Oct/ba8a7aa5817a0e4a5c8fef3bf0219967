The Nakuru county government is willing to engage residents of one of the largest estates in Naivasha in talks over house rent arrears running into millions of shillings. The administration wants to solve the crisis after former Governor Kinuthia Mbugua waived the arrears and suspended payment of rent until the houses are renovated .Mbugua, however, did not put this in writing. The new regime has demanded that the residents clear the debt. Viwandani MCA Eric Gichuki said he raised the issue with Governor Lee Kinyajui to find an amicable solution, saying the talks were positive. The county government will engage the 5,000 tenants to seek the way forward. Last month, all tenants were given 14 days to clear their arrears.
