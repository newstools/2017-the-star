The voter turnout in Kenya on October 26 was one of the lowest on the African continent since the reintroduction of multiparty elections in Kenya in 1992. Analysis of the results forms has thrown up several reasons why the IEBC’s figures lack credibility. First, the number of registered voters in Kenya is in flux. In fact, it has changed three times since the Register of Voters was gazetted in June. Without a credible number of registered voters, it is impossible to calculate voter turnout definitively. Second, the calculation is based on tallies that lack results from the majority of polling stations in certain constituencies. For instance, the IEBC has published results from Kisumu West, but the form from that constituency has results only. KYSY deployed approximately 2,000 observers in 44 of the 47 counties around the country to observe election and human rights violations. The observers are responsible for monitoring Election Day processes, and transmitting photos of posted Forms 34A (polling station-level results) and Forms 34B (constituency-level tally of results). KYSY also monitors and analyses results posted on the official IEBC website. This problem is compounded by the lack of complete “handing over” sections on Forms 34B. Without this section, it is impossible to know how many polling station results were handed over and tallied at the constituency level. Third, the reliability of Forms 34B is questionable, because many of them are marred by the same issues that were raised in the previous election. Takeaways: â€¨The legitimacy of this election and its result are severely threatened. Voter turnout in the â€¨The highest turnout was seen in Jubilee strongholds, and the lowest turnout was seen in NASA strongholds. â€¨ There are no available results from 32 constituencies, either because the election did not occur there or because data is missing from the IEBC. â€¨ Problems with Forms 34B, which include incomplete forms, nonstandard forms and forms without serial numbers, suggest that some of the most basic issues were never addressed. â€¨ There are questions about whether the IEBC fully complied with the constitutional standards for electoral integrity, including transparency, verifiability, accuracy and simplicity. â€¨ There are also questions about whether the IEBC should have conducted the poll at all, given the lack of clarity and confusion over what laws it used to maintain Odinga’s name on the ballot and names of all the other candidates on the ballot.
