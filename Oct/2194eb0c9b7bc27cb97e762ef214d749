Taita Taveta Governor Granton Samboja has called on security officials to arrest the authors of leaflets circulating calling on nonlocals to leave within 72 hours. After attending church on Sunday, he said the handwritten leaflets were spotted in Voi. “It’s sad that there are some people from this county spreading leaflets telling people from other tribes to pack up and go. Don’t go anywhere. I want to be categorical that all Kenyans have a right to stay in any place in this country. It’s their constitutional right. Those doing that should stop this vice of tribalism,” Samboja said. Voi MP Jones Mlolwa urged the church to pray for the country. “Our country has a lot of challenges. If the just-concluded election can help us move forward, let it be so. Let’s all maintain peace. This is our country and when we destroy it, we are the same people to build it,” he said. Mlolwa said he will hold meetings with administration officials and discuss how to maintain security. “We are not here by mistake. We have lived here peacefully without regarding our tribal background. We shall not entertain those seeking to divide us on tribal lines,” he said. County police commander Fred Ochieng told the Star on the phone officers have launched investigations to establish the authors of the leaflets. He said investigations are ongoing. “For now we don’t want to give detailed information on the issue because we don’t want to compromise our investigations. But we cannot allow some elements in the society to disrupt the peace,” Ochieng said.
