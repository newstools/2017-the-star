Nyandarua leaders have thanked President Uhuru Kenyatta for his weekend visit and his goodies. Uhuru said he had adopted Nyandarua and declared himself governor number one and Francis Kimemia governor number two. â€œIt is a great thing for the President to say he has become the governor of a county. Nowhere else has he said that. That means he wants to give Nyandarua special attention,â€ Kimemia said on Sunday. He said he is ready and happy to work as under Uhuru to make Nyandarua number one in Kenya. Kimemia spoke after service at ACK Mirangine, Ol Kalou constituency. He was accompanied by Youth CS Sicily Kariuki.  Kimemia thanked Uhuru for committing to fast-track the establishment of Nyandarua University, which will enrol its first students in January.
