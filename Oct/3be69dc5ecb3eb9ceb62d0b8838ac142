Police yesterday stormed the home of former Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale (pictured) in Malinya village, Ikolomani, claiming he was organising a gang to disrupt tomorrow’s repeat presidential election. The more than 20 officers said they wanted to search for a consignment of used tyres they claimed Khalwale was holding in his home for use to barricade roads during tomorrow’s rerun. The officers arrived at 2pm, but were denied access to the houses by the family, who said the search could only take place in the presence of their lawyers. Khalwale was not at home. Lawyers Innocent Ondieki and Evans Getanda arrived an hour later and upon scrutinising the court order doubted its authenticity. The officers left without conducting a search. “The officers have what they purport to be an order from the court to search the former senator’s home, but we highly doubted its authenticity,” Ondieki said. Getanda said the order did not have serious security features such as the date it was issued and a seal. It read, “I hearby issue a search warrant order to the said applicant to enable him enter and search the homestead of the respondent to ascertain his information and act according to the law.” Western regional police commander Moses Ombati, unaware that the officers had left, said the warrant was valid. “Let’s wait for the officers to finish what they’re doing and see what they come up with. They have proper authority to carry out the search,” he said. The officers went back to court, which confirmed the authenticity of the order, but they once again failed to conduct a search when they found a crowd at Khalwale’s home.
