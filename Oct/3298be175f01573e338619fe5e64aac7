Governor Mike Sonko plans to spend Sh4.2 billion on solid waste management to end the garbage menace. The city has been grappling with poor garbage collection since Governor Evans Kideroâ€™s administration, but Sonko has pledged to rid Nairobi of garbage . The Sonko administration has drafted a Sh17.8 billion budget for the 2017-18 financial year. Energy, and Transport and Infrastructure have been allocated Sh3.8 billion and 3.43 billion. The county has set aside Sh3.24 billion for housing and settlement, Sh1.3 billion for ICT and Sh1 billion for water. Poor rains have caused a water shortage in Nairobi and many parts of Kenya. The county sank boreholes to supplement supply from the cityâ€™s main source, Ndakaini Dam in Murangâ€™a county. Its levels have sunk to alarming levels.
