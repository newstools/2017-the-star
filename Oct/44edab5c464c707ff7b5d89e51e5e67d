Kenya Red Cross will provide 50 tonnes of green grams seeds to 200,000 households in Kitui ahead of the onset of the October-December rains. Red Cross head of disaster risk management Elijah Muimi said the distribution of the seeds will be done in conjunction with the county government. He spoke on Friday when a Red Cross delegation paid a courtesy call on Governor Charity Ngilu. Muimi said the high quality certified seed will improve crop yields. Ngilu said agriculture and wealth creation were two key pillars of her development agenda. â€œMy key agenda is to ensure food security - dealing with the basics is the best formula and foundation towards improving the livelihood of our people,â€ she said. Seven boreholes have been repaired across Kitui through the countyâ€™s partnership with the Red Cross. â€œWe appreciate all efforts by partners towards ensuring our people get sufficient water. My government began the initiative on my inauguration day,â€ Ngilu said. She called on residents to engage in green grams farming as it is viable in many parts of the dry county.
