Bishop Cornelius Kipng’eno arap Korir of the Eldoret Catholic Diocese  is dead. He was found dead in his house at Elgon View estate by helpers who had gone to prepare him for a flight to Nairobi for treatment. The body was taken to Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital mortuary on Monday. Bishop Korir was born in 1950 at Segutiet, Kericho Diocese in the former Bomet District. He was ordained Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Eldoret on June 2, 1990. This was when the diocese, which then included Kitale, had 50 parishes. Korir, a staunch human rights defender, was then consecrated as Bishop on June 2, 1990. Bishop Korir has presided over an unprecedented increase in church membership. He has also been instrumental in the growth of the Catholic Church's education and health sectors. This was seen through the several schools and hospitals he helped build in the region. In October 2013, he established the Upendo FM radio station that broadcasts from his diocesan office on 89.4 FM in the North Rift. He served in Molo, Kituro and Nakuru before taking up the role of Vocations Director and Episcopal Vicar at the Diocese of Kericho.
