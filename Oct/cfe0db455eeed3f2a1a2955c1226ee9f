Not even the rain could stop the elderly in Lari constituency, Kiambu county, from casting ballots yesterday. They said they have faced many challenges in life, and the
rain would not be a detterent. “We have never heard people repeating an election. All we
know is vote and then we go and wait for another five years. Until now, I do
not know what happened that we are repeating this,” Hannah Wairimu, 92, said. She spoke at Kibagare Primary School polling station, where she thanked IEBC officials for allowing her jump the long
queue together with pregnant women. However, residents who arrived as early as 5am complained a
queue in one of the halls was moving slowly due to a faulty KIEMS kit. “The machine is switching itself off after verifying two
voters,” said John Waithaka. But presiding officer Jane Kaihura said they
informed the constituency tallying centre and the
machine went back to normal. “We had started getting stressed. We don’t know what had
happened. It went back to normal. As of now we have verified more than 50
voters and it has not gone off and we hope it won’t,” she said. Food vendors made a killing selling tea, mandazis and cake. “Due to the weather condition today, people are taking a lot
of tea. We are selling it at Sh10 above the normal price at the shopping
centre,” Selina Njoki said.
