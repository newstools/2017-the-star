Fifty women from Kandara constituency yesterday dared DPP Keriako Tobiko to pursue the charges against embattled MP Alice Wahome. The women said the matter had been blown out of proportion, adding “it shows total disrespect for women in power”. “While appreciating that the rule of law must be upheld, we regret the public lynching in social media of Hon Alice Wahome, which is totally unrelated to the facts, but to the prevailing political circumstances,”Kigumo MP Wangari Mwaniki told the press in Nairobi. Wahome’s troubles started after a video showing her confronting IEBC returning officer Martin Malonza went viral. A hashtag was started on Twitter dubbed #ArrestAliceWahome. The confrontation was after President Uhuru Kenyatta’s 440 votes were allocated to Japheth Kaluyu, who had garnered zero votes. Wahome claimed Malonza did not give Jubilee agents time to verify results on Form 34B despite requesting to do so. Wahome, who was the chief party agent for Jubilee said constituency chief agent John Gitau had raised the matter with the returning officer, who said the issue would be dealt with at the end of the exercise. “I also asked Malonza to give us more time to agree on what to do about the wrong entry, but he flatly refused and became loud and uncooperative without regarding the agents,” she said. Wahome said the issue was not about changing results, but a disagreement on how to deal with “votes stolen from Uhuru”.
