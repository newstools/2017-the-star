Murang’a Senator Irungu Kang’ata is among the leaders who has offered free transport to voters from Nairobi to any destination in the county to vote for President Uhuru Kenyatta. In a notice seen by the Star yesterday, he said the only requirement is that one carries his ID card. Voters will be picked at the Total, Koinange stage. “I will be at the Koinange petrol station and stage on Thursday morning by 6am to ensure that every Murang’a county voter gets transport to their polling station. All they need is to show up and I will pay the matatu fare,” Kang’ata told the Star. Other leaders who have joined the initiative include Governor Mwangi Wairia, woman representative Sabina Chege and all five MPs in the county. Kang’ata said he is willing to sell all he has to ensure voters cast their vote.
