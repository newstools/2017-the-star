We support the Independent Police Oversight Authority’s Police for its pursuit of three officers involved in the post-election deaths of protesters. These cases should be a major wake-up call for the National Police Service, who behave as if they have no stocks of plastic bullets. Anti-riot police in Kenya are armed with AK-47 assault rifles, which are military caliber weapons. The police should urgently change riot-control policy and practice and use teargas first before resorting to any kind of bullets. Even rubber bullets are a tough option – they can smash limbs and skulls but rarely kill. There will almost certainly be violent protests when the election results are announced, if not before in the NASA zones where IEBC officials are already being attacked and intimidated. The legacy of the prolonged 12th General Election ought to be changes in anti-riot police tactics and strategies. The deaths of unarmed protesters should be a thing of the past in Kenya after this extended electioneering period.
