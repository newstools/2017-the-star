A section of MCAs from Garissa now blame the county Public Service Board for â€˜overseeing the messâ€™ that has led to the laying off of hundreds of staff.  The MCAs asked Governor Ali Korane to use the right procedure to lay off staff. The layoffs were made in a bid to cut the wage bill and get rid of ghost workers.  A number of staff have been issued with dismissal letters.  The 400 revenue clerks were on Monday ordered to return receipt books to the main office as they await further communication.  Speaking to the press at the assembly yesterday, minority leader Mohamed Sheikh and MCAs Mohamed Abdi (Dadaab), Farah Maow (Sankuri) and Mohamed Gedi (nominated) urged Korane to give notice to the affected staff before sacking them.  â€œThe PSB is partly to blame. They were silent when people were illegally recruited. We appeal for the county administration to be humane and give those affected the required notice,â€ Sheikh said. Last week, Korane suspended 2,000 casual labourers hired under the â€˜Ugatuzi na kaziâ€™ drive initiated by former governor Nathif Jama. He said there was no legal framework or budget for their engagement. Maow said the board should take full responsibility because it is legally mandated to employ staff. He said the board has been silent when senior staff employ workers through â€˜delegated authorityâ€™. There are about 6,200 staff at the county.
