Youths in Soweto slum in Embakasi East constituency yesterday engaged police in running battles as they protested against yesterday’s election. Anti-riot police fired several times in the air to disperse the irate youths who had attempted to block voters entering polling stations. The youths, who were chanting no election slogans, blocked roads. At one point, screams could be heard as gunshots rent the air with the relentless youths taunting the police. Some residents claimed the protesters were strangers in the area. Meanwhile, voting went on smoothly in other areas in the constituency. In Makadara constituency, voting went on at Buruburu 1 Primary School and Uhuru Primary School with no incidence of violence. Buruburu OCPD Geoffrey Maiyek said police were alert.
