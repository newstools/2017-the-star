Three children were hospitalised on Tuesday after police fired tear gas canisters at St Peter's Awich Kidingo ECDE centre in Kisumu. Headteacher Eunice Odhiambo said two children were taken to Milimani Hospital and one rushed to Lumumba Hospital. She said 20 pupils did not report to school following the Monday incident as they were affected by tear gas. The school has 101 pupils. "When we ran to the class, we found a teargas canister and smoke inside. We started getting the students out of the classes," she told The Star. She said before they had evacuate all the children, a second canister was lobbed into the school premises. Odhiambo said she started recording the incident when two more canisters were fired into the school. "While I was recording the video, an officer jumped through the fence," she said. "I locked myself in the administration block before they left." The incident took place as police fired tear gas and shot at anti-IEBC demonstrators in Kisumu on Monday. NASA has called for countrywide protests every Monday and Friday until their demands to the electoral agency are met. More on this: Raila skips IEBC demos as Nairobi supporters brave teargas
