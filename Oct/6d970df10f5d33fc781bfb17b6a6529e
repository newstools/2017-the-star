Makindu DCIO Jimmy Kimaru brandished a gun during a confrontation between him and MPs Joshua Kimilu (Kaiti) and Thaddeus Nzambia (Kilome) in Makindu Shopping Center, Makueni during NASA demonstrations on Monday. The MPs had led Opposition supporters in anti-IEBC demos in the shopping centre on Mombasa-Nairobi highway. They scampered to safety when the plain clothed officer followed them in to their cars demanding they come out to be arrested. Kimaru was accompanied by other plain clothed officers gave up when he realised journalists were watching the confrontation.

Youths lit fires in the middle of the highway, causing traffic snarl up before police clobbered a number of them. Earlier on, the MPs and 23 MCAs led NASA supporters in their first demonstrations since the Opposition announced the Monday and Friday demos to push for IEBC reforms and removal from officials thought to have bungled the August 8 general election. They matched through the streets chanting anti-IEBC and anti-Jubilee slogans. Both plain clothes and uniformed officers trailed demonstrators as they matched on one side of the busy highway. During their speeches, the leaders vowed NASA will not participate in the repeat polls if their demands will not be met. “We want to tell President Uhuru Kenyatta that there will no repeat election if [IEBC CEO] Ezra Chiloba and those officers who stole Raila Odinga’s victory will be in office,” said Makueni  Majority leader Kyalo Mumo.
