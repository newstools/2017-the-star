The votes President Uhuru Kenyatta garnered in Kitui county during last Thursday’s repeat presidential polls dipped.  During the August 8 election, he garnered 64,726 votes, while during the repeat polls, he got 46,300 votes. The poor showing was despite former Kitui Senator David Musila, who lost his bid for governor, promising to win Uhuru many votes.  In Kitui South , Uhuru got 10,346 votes down from 11,669, while in Kitui Central, he got 8,221 votes, down from 13,630 in August. Uhuru’s 6,210 votes in Kitui East were less than the 8,622 he got in August, while the 4,537 votes he got in August in Kitui declined to 3,353 votes during last Thursday’s polls.
