President
Uhuru Kenyatta has warned Embakasi East MP Babu Owino against instigating violence in the constituency during Thursday polls. Uhuru
said the youthful legislator is 'at liberty to insult him' as long as he doesn't incite his
electorates to cause violence. He said the the remarks do not cause him sleepless nights as many would want to be made to believe.  "That
young man keeps on hurling insults to me but let me tell him
categorically, if he try to sprout violence, he will know that people
were born." Uhuru spoke for the first time, since Babu's arrest over 'mtoto wa mbwa' remarks, during an interview with Citizen TV at State House, Nairobi.  The MP was charged following the remarks he made at a public rally in Kibera.  The sentiments angered Jubilee supporters sparking protests.  He
was charged with subversion, insulting Uhuru and incitement to
violence. Babu
denied the charges. He spent two nights in police cells and was
eventually released on Sh200,000 bail. More on this: Babu Owino freed on Sh500,000 bail in 'mtoto wa mbwa' case Also read: 'Free at last': Babu Owino released on Sh200,000 bail with warnings Afterwards,
Starehe MP Charles Njagua engaged in a fistfight with the legislator
at Parliament's media center over the same.  Njagua,
popularly known as musician Jaguar, is said to have asked Babu to
stop insulting the president hence the fight.  The first time legislator promised to "square it out" with BabuÂ if he continues
to insult Uhuru and the presidency. "Babu
should stop insulting the President. If he does not, we also know how
to insult. We are youthful leaders, we will square it out." The
legislator said Babu's reaction, after he approached him with his
warning, provoked him to act. See: [VIDEO] Drama as Babu Owino, Jaguar fight in Parliament
