Embu nurses have agreed to end the over three months strike after the county government agreed to sign a return-to-work fromula. The nurses agreed to resume work by Friday this week after the county government agreed to implement their promotion, redesignation and confirmation demands. They had been pushing the three issues to be addressed even before the countrywide strike began on June 5. The countrywide strike was called to push for the implementation of the CBA. Embu nurses reached an agreement following a lengthy meeting between officials and the county. The nurses agreed to pull out of the nationwide strike and wait for a consensus to be reached between the national officials and the CoG over the CBA.  Embu county director for Health Ndwiga Mugendi said nurses are expected to sign an agreement on Friday. He said the county has no problem with the CBA and is ready to implement whatever the national union officials agree on with the SRC and the CoG. Nursesâ€™ union branch secretary Joseph Ngwaci said members are ready to resume work because the county has shown goodwill. He thanked the county government for addressing their concerns. A joint committee has been formed to discuss other concerns of nurses. Nurses have devolved their mass action to the counties, where various governors are in the process of replacing those still on strike. Kenya National Union of Nursesâ€™ deputy secretary general Maurice Opetu on Monday said the unit is strengthening its branches to hold demonstrations throughout the week. â€œWe wonâ€™t have one demo in Nairobi this week. We are banking our strength on the counties,â€ he said.
