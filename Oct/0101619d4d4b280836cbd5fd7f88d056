The Health ministry has raised concerns over the rising cases of breast and cervical cancer among children and productive young people. The medics raised concerns on Thursday during the closing ceremony of the breast and cervical cancer screening drive at Kenyatta National Hospital. Cancer in Kenya is ranked the third cause of death after infectious and cardiovascular diseases.  “Years ago in ward 1E, I used to find about 30 patients and maybe 5 in Level 3. These days when I walk around ward 1E, it is full to capacity and Level 3 can make two other wards of children with cancer,” deputy director of nursing services Rosemary Mutua said. She continued, “We used to think cancer was a disease for the elderly.” According to the 2017-2022 National Cancer Control Strategy, about 80 per cent of childhood cancers are potentially curable, but only 20 to 30 per cent of children treated at KNH experience long-term disease-free survival.  The Ministry of Health now intends to integrate childhood cancers into existing public health promotion programmes and sensitise healthcare workers on clinical presentation of childhood cancers as well as prompt referrals.  This is to increase cure rates for childhood cancers through early detection, treatment and appropriate referrals . The medics also raised concerns Kenyans are going for cancer screening when it is too late.  According to KNH CEO Lily Koros, many patients would survive the disease if they were diagnised at an early stage and put under treatment.  She urged Kenyans to go for early screening for detection, adding all types of cancer are treatable when detected early. “KNH has adequate equipment and there is no waiting time for cancer patients,” Koros said.
