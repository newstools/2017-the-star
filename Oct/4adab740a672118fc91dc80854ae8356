A Mombasa MCA has been released on a Sh200,000 bond for calling President Uhuru Kenyatta a "caretaker president". Ibrahim Omondi pleaded not guilty to two counts including subversion. The Airport ward rep allegedly uttered the words while addressing the press last Thursday. "Uhuru should be very careful. I am telling you that he is not even the president of Kenya. He is a caretaker president by now," the MCA had said. Omondi also said there will be no election in Mombasa on Thursday. "We are going to do everything possible to stop that election." State counsel Yamina Jami said they will apply to have Omondi's bail revoked. "This case is not a light matter and we intend to bring you reasons why we object him being released on bond," the prosecutor told the court on Monday. Through laywer Mohammed Faki, Omondi said his rights were violated as police denied him bail when he was arrested on Friday. Senior principal magistrate Francis Kyambia gave Omondi an alternative cash bail of Sh100,000. [VIDEO] Uhuru is still your president, Duale tells NASA on MPs' swearing-in
