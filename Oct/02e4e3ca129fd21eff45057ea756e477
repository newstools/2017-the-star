Nyeri Governor Wahome Gakuru has dropped 65-year-old Sheila Githaiga who had been nominated to head Youth, Gender and Social Services. Githaiga was not present during the swearing in of the other nine CEC nominees and county secretary nominee Ben Gachichio at the governor’s office yesterday. Her absence was a clear indication she will not serve in the county government.   The youth protested against her appointment to the docket, bearing her age. The county assembly approved her.  The docket has been transferred to the Public Administration and Public Service docket headed by Beth Karimi. Gakuru has urged the youth to apply for chief officer positions, instead of protesting that they are being left out of county jobs. “I’m here to serve you, not to enrich myself,” he said.
