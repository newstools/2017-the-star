The board of Nairobi Water and Sewerage Company has protested its suspension by Governor Mike Sonko. The workersâ€™ union, however, wants the board disbanded, saying it almost brought the firm to its knees by attempting to sell. The board denies this. In a September 27 letter, Sonko suspended the board of directorsâ€™ operations over allegations of gross misconduct. The letter signed by acting county secretary Leboo ole Morintat was addressed to chairman Raphael Nzomo. â€œThe Nairobi government is in receipt of serious allegations of misconduct by the board of directors. Consequently, the county government has suspended all operations of the board, including meetings of the board, pending investigations,â€ reads the letter. Sonko had verbally suspended the board on August 22 when he visited the firm to calm the workers protesting against the sacking of MD Philip Gichuki and three directors by the board. The board has, however, been carrying on with its work, saying it had not received official communication from the governor, suspending operations. Nzomo said the suspension was unlawful and not in good faith. â€œHow can you suspend someone you have never met? What misconduct are they referring to when we are just doing our work? The governor has never listened to us and there is no reason, other than the gross misconduct that is in this letter,â€ he said. On the claims the board attempted to sell the company, he said, â€œThis is an old excuse that we have denied in all forums and committees we have appeared before. This plan never existed in the first place.â€ He said the Kenya County Government Workersâ€™ union has been working in collusion with some managers and long-serving staff to fight its efforts to reform the company.
