Governor Martin Wambora has said the Embu Level 5 Teaching and Referral Hospital will not be sold, but made autonomous for efficient service delivery. He dismissed claims the county government is planning to sell the recently refurbished hospital to a private company. Wambora said making the hospital autonomous will get rid of bureaucracy and interference from the county and ensure efficient and affordable service delivery. Speaking to the press on Thursday, Wambora said he wants the hospital to reach the level of Kenyatta National Hospital or Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret. “This is a simple thing. There is nothing like selling Embu Level 5 Hospital. We are just saying let’s give it some more autonomy so that we reduce bureaucracy. But it will continue being the cheapest. It will never compare to private hospitals. It will remain a public facility,” he said. Wambora said he wants the hospital to run like those in India, where employees are hired on contract.
