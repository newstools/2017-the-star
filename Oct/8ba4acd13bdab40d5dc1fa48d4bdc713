 Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong has thanked the Samia community for voting for him during the August 8 election. He promised to work closely with elected leaders to deliver efficient services. Samia is a Luhya subethnic group. The community resides in Funyula. Ojaamongâ€™s rival Paul Otuoma served as Funyula MP for two terms. Ojaamong spoke at the burial of Ernest Awori, the brother of former Vice President and Funyula MP Moody Awori. He eulogised Ernest as a great man, who contributed to community development. Ernest died on September 27 at Nangina Mission Hospital at the age of 81. â€œThe cruel hand of death robbed the Awori family of a man whose career as an architectural engineer helped transform the housing industry,â€ Ojaamong said on Saturday.  He also attended the burial of Levis Majale, the brother of former Agenga Nanguba MCA.
