A family in Likii village, just outside Nanyuki town, is looking for their daughter who has been missing for a month. Esther Wanjira, 16, was last seen on September 4 when she was sent home for school fees. She is a form two student at Kangubiri Girls High School, Nyeri. Father James Mwangi yesterday told the Star that for three weeks they thought their firstborn child was in school until the principal called to ask why she had not reported back. â€œI had cleared all the school fees but was surprised to be informed that my daughter had been sent home. I later realised she failed to present the bank slip and left the school alongside others who had fee balances,â€ he said. Two suspects, among them a university student believed to be Wanjira's boyfriend, have been arrested. Kennedy Ekai and Timothy Meme last Friday in a Nanyuki court denied kidnap chargesand were released on Sh200,000 bond each.
