IEBC has gazetted Uhuru Kenyatta and William Ruto as President-elect and deputy president-elect respectively. This followed the electoral agency's Monday declaration of the two as the winner of the October 26 repeat poll. Chairman Wafula Chebukati, in the October 30 issue, said the two were duly elected in line with Article 138 (4) of the Constitution. Uhuru and Ruto were issued with their winning certificates at the Bomas of Kenya following the poll that has been disputed by their rivals NASA. Opposition leader Raila Odinga said the repeat poll, which he asked his supporters to boycott, was shambolic. The president-elect garnered 7,483,895 (98.26 per cent) of the 7,616,217 cast in the election while Raila was second with 73,228 votes. Lawyer Ekuru Aukot (Thirdway Alliance) got 21,333, former Lugari MP Cyrus Jirongo 14,107, Kavinga Kaluyu 8,261, Michael Wainaina 6,000 and Joe Nyaga 5,554. Uhuru said the poll vindicated him as the validly elected president in the August 8 general election which was annulled by the Supreme Court on September 1 hence the repeat vote. If the election is not challenged, the president-elect and deputy president-elect will be sworn-in after 14 days. Raila is expected to address his supporters on the way forward following IEBC's conclusion of the voting process. More on this: IEBC has confirmed my victory but I'll accept court challenge - Uhuru
