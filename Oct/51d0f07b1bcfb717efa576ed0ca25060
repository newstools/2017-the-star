Three Murangâ€™a MPs have dismissed envoysâ€™ criticism of the proposed changes to the election laws, adding they cannot interfere with the operations of the National Assembly. The MPs are Kiharuâ€™s Ndindi Nyoro, Gatangaâ€™s Joseph Nduati and Mathioyaâ€™s Peter Kimari. They said the electoral changes have to be effected if the country is to have free and fair elections. The MPs said the envoys should stop interfering in local politics and not â€œattempt to tell legislators how to do their workâ€. Speaking in Kiharu constituency on Monday while campaigning for President Uhuru Kenyattaâ€™s reelection, the leaders said the amendments are for posterity. â€œWe appreciate their opinion, but that will not deter our push to have the electoral laws amended,â€ Kimari said. He said the sole purpose of Parliament is to make laws that benefit Kenyans, adding that the changes to the electoral laws will safeguard votes. Kimari wondered why the opposition has issues with a law that calls for the punishment of IEBC officers who falsify election documents or fail to sign or stamp them.  Ambassadors and High Commissioners from 14 countries criticised the amendments being made by Jubilee, saying the timing is wrong. The diplomats said the changes will affect the IEBCâ€™s preparedness. They said their countries could impose sanctions, including travel bans for political leaders who will take hardline positions. Kimari said the amendments will not interfere with the work of the IEBC and will only compel its officials to work with strict diligence. â€œTelling us to do away with the amendments is joking with the will of Kenyans. We are trying to avoid a recurrence of the issues that cropped up during the last election,â€ he said.  Nduati said Parliament has formed a select committee to handle the amendments â€œbut NASA chose to keep offâ€.
