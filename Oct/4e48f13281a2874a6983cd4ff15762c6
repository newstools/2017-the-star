Ukoo Flani member BlackGzas Dadi is ranting about the inappropriate requests he has received from radio presenters during his media tour for his single called Wanataka. Speaking to Word is, the rapper said, "I can say that all has been well but their challenges from the media personalities as they want some bribe for them to interview or host me in their shows. You ask someone politely to feature you on his show because you have a new a project but they request for money to do so." He added, "For me, I don't see the reason to do that because he/she is paid a salary by the company to do their job. After all, I spend a lot of money to produce the video and I don't even how I will get the money back." he ranted. "I'd rather spend that money on children in the streets instead of giving someone who is earning a salary so that they can play my music. I believe my music is very good and people are embracing and appreciating it but presenters tend to have a negative altitude when you are still young in the music game. But when you start to succeed they befriend you. Thats so valueless because they are not supporting the artists in Kenya for instance does Wizkid pay anybody for his music to be played in the stations?" BlackGzas asked. He concluded, "So I don't see why I should beg people to play my music if it is good then one day it will be fully accepted."
