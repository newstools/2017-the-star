 Ecobank has partnered with Visa to launch Ecobank Scan+Pay with mVisa solutions for their consumers. The strategic tie-up signals interoperability on a cross-border level â€“ and potentially huge gains â€“ as it affords consumers the ability to use their mobile phone to directly access the funds in their bank accounts to pay person-to-merchant (P2M) or person-to-person (P2P). Ecobank Scan+Pay with mVisa delivers instant, secure cashless payment for goods and services by allowing customers to scan a QR code on a smartphone or enter a unique merchant identifying code into either a feature phone or smartphone.  The payment goes straight from the consumerâ€™s bank account into the merchantâ€™s account and provides real-time notification to both parties.
