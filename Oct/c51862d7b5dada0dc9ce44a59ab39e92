Blogger Cyprian Nyakundi has been the talk of the town after he made ugly comments towards KISS FM presenter Adelle Onyango. He
said, “Adelle Onyango gave a powerful speech against the rape culture.
Pardon my arrogance, but who in their right mind would want to rape, let
alone have consensual sex with her? Asking for a friend.” This has not gone down well with many people, who have bashed him for the shameful remarks. Adelle's colleague Chito Ndhlovu has also spoken out on the issue, stating that an apology is in order. "I
saw this yesterday and couldn't help but feel extremely sad and
disappointed," he said. "I expected more from you as a man with the great power you
possess. I don't say this because Adelle is my friend or because we
work together. NO! I say this because, if it was any other woman you
wrote this about or to, I would tell you the same thing. "We have
always had an honest policy among us and this was out of hand, out of
line and a gross violation against the human rights you fight for. "What
people like you and I are to do is to give them a voice, expose the
perpetrators, educate people about it and call out those oppressing
them, not victimise them. Adelle Onyango is a strong woman, for her to
even talk about it makes her a role model to many. I am even more proud
of her because she overcame and I have profound respect for her husband
because, he knows her story but he has held her down, loved her and even
put a ring on it. That is a real man who knows how to love a real
woman. "That said, I strongly disagree with your sentiments here
below and an apology is in order mate. Real men don't oppress women,
real men don't downplay another's emotions, real men protect women, real
men know when they have done wrong and that an apology must follow.
Real men stand for truth. You always call yourself a real man stand by
your mantra."
