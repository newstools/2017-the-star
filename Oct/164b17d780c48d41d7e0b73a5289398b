Many have condemned the brutality meted out on University of Nairobi students during their demonstrations. Among the voices is NTV reporter Ken Mijungu who has threatened to resign if Inspector General (IG) Boinnet doesn't take any action about the matter.  "As a Kenyan citizen, I am taking a moral high ground on police brutality. After watching several of the videos especially of the police tear gassing students in their hostel, I am asking the IG Boinnet to take action on the police within 7 days, arrest and prosecute. If he doesnâ€™t I will resign. There is no moral obligation to continue reporting on the same thing time and again without translating to something. Itâ€™s useless and frustrating," he posted on Facebook. Kenyans reacted; Migwi Sam: This sounds BOLD but hey... Don't be so tough on yourself bro. There's always a story behind a story. Unearth it before you decide to exit. The revelations. Victor Oluoch: ...and how is your resignation going to affect the IG, or even his Police force? You should do things, like walk naked, or starve to death ..or something along that line. Patrick Mukora: Before you resign please do a feature on someone who has been caught up in one of those university protests ...... more if they were harassed, beaten up or robbed by the protesting students ...
