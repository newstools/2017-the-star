Over 300 farmers and business people in Lelan ward, Pokot South subcounty, are counting huge losses after roads were made impassable by heavy rains. At least 250,000 litres of milk have gone bad and fresh vegetables rotted after the main road to the market was cut off. Dairy farmers have resorted to using donkeys to transport milk to the nearest coolers. More than 15 lorries are stuck in the mud along the roads linking West Pokot and the neighboring Elgeyo Marakwet county. “We have been forced to hire tractors to transport our milk to cooling plants, but they are not helping us because they cannot ply the bad roads,” farmer Jackson Mnangat said. West Pokot Governor Prof John Lonyangapuo and Lelan MCA Johnston Lokato visited on Monday and blamed the Kenya Rural Roads Authority.  “The government allocates millions of shillings to Kurra every year but they have failed to repair the roads,” Lonyangapuo said.  Boda boda operator William Longarasie said he is unable to work.  Lonyangapuo urged the Muruny Siyoi Sh10 billion water project contractor to build roads as part of its corporate social responsibility.
