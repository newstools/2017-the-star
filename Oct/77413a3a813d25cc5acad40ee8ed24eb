The Vihiga deputy OCS and two junior officers were injured on Saturday while chasing after protesters at Majengo Market. Several other people were also injured, one critically, after he was run over by a police van. One was taken to Mukumu hospital with a bullet wound. A witness said trouble started when a group found marked ballot papers in two vehicles belonging to a trader in Majengo. The youths had been washing cars at their yard. They alerted Central Maragoli MCA Evans Chunguli who led them in the demonstration. Officers later tried to disperse the demonstrators who had already barricaded a section of Kisumu-Kakamega. The policemen were reportedly injured by their colleagues as they were in plain clothes. They were taken to Mbale referral hospital. Vihiga medical superintendent Emmanuel Ayodi said the officers' injuries were not serious. Chuguli was taken to Vihiga police station and will be charged with incitement.
