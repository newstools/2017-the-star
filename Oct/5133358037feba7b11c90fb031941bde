A Malindi televangelist and 21 followers on Monday were remanded for 15 days as police investigate his radical teachings. Pastor Paul Makenzi of the Good News international Ministries is facing charges of radicalisation, operating unlicensed teaching institution and TV station and denying children their right to education and medical care. Police on Friday and Saturday raided the church in Surunzi, Malindi town, and rescued 73 people. Of the 73, 52 are children under 18, school drop outs and runaways. Those in court are 21 adults. Makenzi was accused of teaching children that formal education promotes devil worship. He tells them to stay in his church so they will go to heaven. Makenzi and his followers â€” some said to be influential people in his church â€” appeared before Malindi chief magistrate Julie Oseko. Police sought 30 days to investigate, saying the case was very complex, as it involves many people.  Oseko set the case for mention on October 9. DPP counsel David Fedha said the pastor and others were making live recordings of the radicalisation process. He said police were tracing parents of the children rescued from the church.
