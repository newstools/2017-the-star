Alego-Usonga MP Samuel Atandi yesterday told constituents there will be no election tomorrow and warned them they could be in danger if they take poll jobs. Atandi told the Star on the phone that anybody who agrees to be IEBC polling clerks, presiding officers or deputy presiding officers will be going against the public’s will. “I will not defend anybody from the wrath of the public because as leaders, we have repeatedly said there will be no election on Thursday,” Atandi said. He told his constituents to take NASA’s call for an election boycott. seriously. “Do not set foot in any polling station tomorrow,” Atandi said. Nominated MP Jackline Oduol also encouraged supporters to boycott the election. Oduol, who spoke in Siaya town yesterday, asked residents not to be intimidated by the increased number of police officers.
