Garissa Governor Ali Korane on Saturday launched a water trucking and animal feeding programme targetting areas worst-hit by drought in the county. In the last few years, the county has experienced poor rains. Currently, Garissa county is classified as â€œstressedâ€. Areas such as Balambala, Lagdera, Ijara and parts of Dadaab and Fafi subcounties are the worst-hit. Korane said the programme targets to reach the most affected members of the pastoral community. He said his administration will work with the national government and development partners to address the drought situation in the county. Korane said the harsh weather condition has led to the loss of hundreds of animals. He flagged off livestock feed to be distributed in the county. The livestock programme has been funded by the European Union, through the National Drought Management Authority. The governor assured residents the county government will scale-up drought mitigation efforts to alleviate the suffering of the people and their livestock. On Friday, a section of MCAs urged the county government to prioritise tackling of drought, saying the situation is almost â€œgetting out of handâ€.
