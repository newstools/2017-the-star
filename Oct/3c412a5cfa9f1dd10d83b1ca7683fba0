Kikuyu and Kalenjin elders held traditional prayers at a shrine in Timboroa Forest, Uasin Gishu county, on Monday and called for peace. Youth aged below 18 and women were barred. Rev Peter Munga, who is also the secretary general of the Kikuyu Council of Elders, and Pastor Isaac Maiyo from the Kalenjin community led the six-hour prayers. “We met at the shrine because it’s a sacred place within the forest where our communities have been going for prayers since long ago,” Munga said. He said similar prayer meetings will be held in Western, Nyanza, Coast, Northeastern, Eastern and Nairobi. “We urge Kenyans to go to the election in peace,” Munga said.  Maiyo said, “As members of the Kalenjin community, never again shall we engage in animosity with our neighbours. All we want is for all Kenyan communities to live in peace and unite to develop our nation.”
