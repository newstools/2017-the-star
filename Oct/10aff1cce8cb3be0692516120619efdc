Voter apathy coupled with the prevailing drought contributed to low turnout in Thursday’s repeat presidential election. Leaders and residents who spoke to the Star said many pastoralists had crossed to neighbouring counties, while others went to Somalia and Ethiopia in search of water and pasture for their animals. Unlike during the August 8 polls where candidates went a step further to persuade and transport voters to their respective polling stations at their own expense, this was not the case this time round. The situation was the same in Mandera,Wajir and Garissa counties.  During the August polls, President Uhuru Kenyatta of Jubilee beat NASA’s Raila Odinga in all three counties. In Garissa Township constituency, retuning officer Boru Dida put voter turnout at 28 per cent, compared to 80 per cent in August. There are 54,316 registered voters in the constituency. This time round, Uhuru garnered 15,434 votes, while Abduba Dida got 148 votes.  Raila got 110 votes, despite pulling out of the race. Voter fatigue was cited as another reason for low turnout. Mandera Governor Ali Roba on Thursday blamed the drought for the low turnout. Roba was at the forefront in campaigning for Uhuru. He said during the August election, voters from pastoral communities were ferried to their polling stations from far-flung areas and from Nairobi. Roba said this time, leaders did not campaign vigorously for Uhuru. The Economic Freedom Party has denied allegations it circulated messages urging its supporters to boycott the polls. EFP national chairman Issack Hassan said the messages circulated in Mandera county were from an individual and not the party’s head office.
