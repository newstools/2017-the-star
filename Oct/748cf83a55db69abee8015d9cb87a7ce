Former Meru Governor Peter Munya and his PNU party led a three-day campaign for President Uhuru Kenyatta in Meru. He drummed up support for the head of state from Thursday to Sunday. Munya urged residents not to heed to NASA's call to boycott the presidential rerun on Thursday. Munya said Raila might be scheming a boycott to play a gimmick on Jubilee. He said Raila wants Jubilee to relax and not campaign vigorously, yet he is out of the poll. "We all heard he will make a major announcement on October 25. What if he says he is in the running," Munya said.  He urged residents to turn up in large numbers and vote for Uhuru. Munya said if the polls fail, the nation will be in a crisis. He was flanked by his running mate in the August 8 poll Peter Kaberia and other PNU candidates who lost Mugambi Imanyara (Senate) as well as Elizabeth Kailemia (woman rep) among others.
