Former independent presidential aspirant Peter Gichira has been charged afresh in a Nairobi court with three counts of attempting to kill himself, disturbing the peace and destroying IEBC property valued at Sh134,386. When the case came up for hearing before Milimani chief magistrate Francis Andayi yesterday, the prosecution, led by senior state counsel Solomon Naulikha, applied to amend the charge sheet. Gichira, who is out on Sh200,000 cash bail, denied the charges and the hearing was adjourned until January 22. His lawyer Dedan Wachira informed the court that the prosecution had not supplied the defence with all copies of witness statements to enable Gichira to prepare his case. Andayi directed the prosecution to supply the documents before the next hearing. Gichira had won a case against the IEBC when the High Court gave him the greenlight to present his nomination papers as an independent candidate. He was arrested for attempting to jump out of a window from the sixth floor of the IEBC offices on May 27 and spent the two nights at Nairobiâ€™s Central police station. Gichira denied creating a disturbance by â€œshouting and demanding an explanation why he could not be allowed to present his papers, despite the High Court orderâ€. He is accused of damaging an Internet socket, windows and air conditioner.
