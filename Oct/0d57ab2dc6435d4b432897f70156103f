Poaching of the African elephant has declined for the fifth consecutive year, with major reduction in East Africa. This is contained in two reports by the  Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. The two reports are ‘Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants’ and ‘The Elephant Trade Information System’. They show though poaching has gone down, ivory seizures have hit a record high.  According to the reports, 2016 recorded the highest level of seizures of illegally traded ivory by weight, since commercial international trade was banned by CITES in 1989. They show the number of elephant carcasses recorded from three sites in Tanzania dropped by 55 per cent in 2016 compared to 2015.  A similar decline was recorded in Kenya. “While Tanzania remains the subregion’s stronghold for elephant populations, the numbers recorded in Uganda, Kenya and Rwanda are stable or on the rise,” the report says. The findings on the illegal killing of elephants were collected by rangers in more than 60 sites across Africa.
