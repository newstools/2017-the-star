Standard eight candidates today begin the KCPE exam amid political tension following the repeat presidential election last Thursday. There has been tension and violence in Kisumu, Siaya, Homa Bay, Migori and parts of Nairobi county. Some 1,003,556 candidates are expected to sit the exam in 28,566 centres for three days. The first papers will be English language and composition, followed by science, Kiswahili lugha and Kiswahili insha on Wednesday, and finally social studies and religious studies on Thursday. The government has said it will ensure violence and the political fever do not disrupt the national exam. Education CS Fred Matiang’said security measures have been put in place. He said yesterday the examination materials were already in the safety storage containers across all the subcounties. Speaking in Githurai Primary School, Matiang’i, said all subcounty heads will be required to open the containers early in the morning before distribution to various exam centres under supervision of school heads and security agencies. Deputy county commissioners and subcounty directors of education are the custodians of the keys to the containers. Matiang’i said the government will airlift the materials to areas with heavy rainfall. “All centers will be required to begin there examinations as scheduled in the timetables to avoid any cases that might arise to compromise the security and credibility of the examination,” he said. Candidates are required to be careful as they fill the answer sheets for easy detection on computers during marking. Marking will employ the optical mark recognition technology, which involves capturing human-marked data from documents. The answer sheets will be scanned by a device that shines a beam of light on the paper and will detect the marked areas because they reflect less light than the blank parts. Those found culpable of examination fraud risk a 10-year jail term or Sh2 million fine or both
