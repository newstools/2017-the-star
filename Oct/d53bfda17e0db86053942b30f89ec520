Boycotting parliamentary sessions by any side of the political divide does not affect proceedings as long as there is quorum, National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi has said. He yesterday said it is not anchored in law that decisions of the House must be bipartisan. This means that even if, for example, NASA MPs boycott a plenary session but there is the constitutional requirement of at least 50 MPs in the session, the 50 MPs are enough to transact business. â€œDeliberations and decision of a House are not invalid merely because of participation of people who are not supposed to participate or the absence of persons who are supposed to participate but choose not to be present,â€ Muturi said. He spoke in Mombasa during the National Assembly induction of the members of the chairmanâ€™s panel. NASA MPs have been boycotting some House and committee sessions to protest against Jubileeâ€™s alleged bulldozing of proceedings due to its â€˜tyranny of numbersâ€™. Jubilee may use its strength in numbers to make changes to the election laws to give more clout to manually transmitted results than the electronically transmitted ones. Apart from the House Business Committee, other select committees are yet to be formed due to the political fights between the two main political outfits in Parliament, Jubilee and NASA. Only the ad hoc committee to look into Election Laws (Amendment) Bill 2017 has been formed and comprises nine Jubilee MPs. NASA did not appoint six of its MPs to the committee. Another ad hoc committee to look into the supplementary budget estimates is also in place. Muturi, however, said this is not injurious to the conduct of the House business.
