A secondary school teacher in Kuresoi South, Nakuru county has accused his boss of harassing him because he did not give him Sh5,000 from a politician. Samuel Ngeno (pictured) of Chemaner Secondary School, says principal Paul Mutai removed his name from the duty roster. He said he was no longer in charge of the Wildlife Club, Ngeno said. He said the principalâ€™s hostility began after he gave to a class teacher Sh5,000 which had been gifted to students by former area MP Zakayo Cheruiyot. The headteacher wanted the money for himself, Ngeno said. He was summoned to explain why he did not hand over the money to the principal, he said. Mutai has denied frustrating Ngeno.  He accused the teacher of insubordination. â€œHe is fond of insubordination. I called him for a meeting in my office and he failed to show up,â€ Mutai said.  Ngeno has since reported the matter to Nakuru Kuppet branch chairman Eliud Wanjohi. Wanjohi was chased away by Mutai from a board meeting that discussed the matter two weeks ago.  Another meeting is scheduled for tomorrow and Wanjohi insists he will attend.  Kuresoi South subcounty director of education said he is aware of the matter.He said he hasasked the parties involved to solve it amicably.
