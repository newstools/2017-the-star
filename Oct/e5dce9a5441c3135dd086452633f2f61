Kabras Sugar have been drawn in a tricky Pool â€˜Aâ€™ alongside Quins, Leos and Mombasa Sports Club ahead of Christie Sevens tourney this Saturday at the RFUEA grounds. The sugar-millers will open their campaign against Mombasa followed by tough tests against Quins and Leos. Kabras clinched the inaugural Sepetuka Sevens a fortnight ago in Eldoret and coach Charles Cadovillis believes they have the momentum to go for the overall title. Kabras are five points behind champions Homeboyz.  Impala, who are placed third on the standings have a score to settle with Mean Machine, Nakuru and Kisii RFC in Pool â€˜Bâ€™. The Ngong Road outfit lost 7-5 to Mean Machine at the Driftwood Sevens and lost 14-10 to Nakuru at the Prinsloo Sevens. Homeboyz face Western Bulls, Mwamba and Nondies in a tricky Pool C. The deejays have blown hot and cold since winning the opener in Mombasa a fortnight ago and coach Paul Murunga will be hoping his charges stamp their authority in the tournament.  Menengai Oilers, who are chasing their first trophy on the circuit lead the chase in Pool â€˜Dâ€™ and will clash with Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB), Blak Blad and Daystar University. The two teams in each pool qualify for the Main Cup quarters while the teams that will finish third and fourth will be relegated to the bowl.
