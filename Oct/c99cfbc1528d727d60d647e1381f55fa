Kilifi MCAs on Monday rejected Governor Amason Kingiâ€™s candidate for deputy speaker.  The 54 MCAs, including 19 nominated, rejected Caroline Kalume, a former staffer in the governorâ€™s office.  They instead elected MCA Stanley Kenga. Kenga won in the second round after garnering 34 votes against Kalumeâ€™s 20.  Earlier, Kenga had garnered 35 votes, which were not enough to win in the first round. Speaker Jimmy Kahindi called for a second round.  Kenga, an ODM member, becomes the second deputy speaker after the former deputy was elected Ganze MP in August.   Before the election, a new nominated MCA was sworn in to represent people living with disability.  Victorine Nyamolo of ODM became the 19th nominated MCA.  The assembly has more than the required number of nominated MCAs. Speaker Jimmy Kahindi said the MCA was sworn in because her name was in the Kenya Gazette.  But Kahindi said he has written to the IEBC seeking clarification on the issue. It emerged the assembly had budgeted for 54 members, including the speaker.  The budget was for salaries, allowances, and per diem. Having additional members requires fresh financial planning.  The reps also elected Shella MCA Adamson Mwathethe the leader of majority. Valentine Matsaki of Kadu Asili was elected minority leader.  Last month, Kingi was disappointed after it emerged that his choice of speaker was rejected by members who overwhelmingly voted for Kahindi. Kingi attended the first sitting of the assembly for the second term, but left before the election was concluded.
