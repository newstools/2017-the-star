Police are investigating an incident in which a 60-year-old man was found murdered and his genitals chopped off. His body was found abandoned by the roadside in Riruta, Nairobi on Tuesday morning.  Police said they were yet to know those behind the killing and the motive.  The body was moved to the mortuary as investigations continue.  The area did not experience any form of protests following IEBC's declaration of Uhuru Kenyatta as president-elect on Monday.
