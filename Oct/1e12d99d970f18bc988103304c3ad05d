Electoral agency chairman Wafula Chebukati yesterday defended, as lawful, the decision to lock out Ekuru Aukot from the repeat presidential polls, citing the Supreme Courtâ€™s guidelines in 2013 and Aukotâ€™s concession. The Thirdway Alliance presidential candidate had challenged the IEBC for allowing only President Uhuru Kenyatta and NASA leader Raila Odinga to participate in the October 26 polls. The repeat polls were ordered after Railaâ€™s petition led to the nullification of Uhuruâ€™s victory.  In his response, Chebukati said Aukot is not eligible to contest, having not filed a petition of his own or been included as an applicant by Raila. â€œTo my knowledge, the directions by the Supreme Court in the 2013 decision have not be set aside or vacated and still remain good law,â€ the chairman said in an affidavit. â€œHe [Aukot] fell within the classification given of persons excluded from participating as candidates in the fresh elections.â€  The IEBC chair also said the politician publicly conceded defeat at a press conference held outside the National Tallying Centre at the Bomas of Kenya on August 10. Chebukati said Aukotâ€™s exclusion cannot, therefore, be said to be in bad faith or in violation of the constitution. â€œUpon receiving the [nullification] judgement, the IEBC held extensive internal consultation on how the fresh presidential election would be conducted as dictated in the courtâ€™s determination,â€ Chebukati said. He said the judgment did not provide any further guidance on how the fresh election should be conducted. â€œThe nature of the order issued was unprecedented in Kenyaâ€™s history, and as such, there was no settled practice on the handling of such an election,â€ Chebukati said. â€œIn view of the lacuna in law, the commission sought legal advice.â€ He said the commission received written advice from its lawyers, the highlight of which was the issue of the candidates for the purposes of an election.
