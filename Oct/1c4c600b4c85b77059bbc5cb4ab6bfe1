The Megane family is expanding with the introduction of a four-door version, the new Megane Sedan.  This model completes Renaultâ€™s offering in the C-segment and strengthens the brandâ€™s position in markets where compact saloons remain the preferred choice among motorists. Manufactured at Renaultâ€™s Bursa plant in Turkey and set to go on sale this autumn in nearly 30 countries, the new Megane Sedan contributes to the brandâ€™s global growth and the extension of its product range. The launch happened at the Renault showroom in Simba Corp Aspire Centre. Key guests included Renault director Ameet Shroff and brand manager Jonathan Dos Santos.
