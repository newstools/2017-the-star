The Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) has poked holes into claims by the Kenya Private Sector Alliance that the country has suffered a Sh700 billion loss due to political unrest in the country. The institute’s CEO, Kwame Owino, disputed the methodology used by Kepsa to arrive at the figure. He noted that during elections since 1963, there has been a dip in GDP which takes about 18 months to a year to recover. In an interview with KTN, Owino said: “Instead we are adding our opinions and lies to this quantum and it is making public debate around the economy be based on inaccurate numbers. Basically what they did was a census of asking people how much did you lose in terms of business and put it together.” He added: “But that is not the correct way to tell us what the loss is, if business has been destroyed or property that is definitely a loss...but if one did not make a sale because shops were not open and a particular household buys the same goods from another shop, it cannot be classified as a loss.” Owino said the high cost of living, drought and institutions not doing their jobs can be attributed to the economic dip. “We cannot divorce politics from our economy but the worst mistake made by business lobbies in my view was that they crafted their political prejudices in an economic message,” he said.
