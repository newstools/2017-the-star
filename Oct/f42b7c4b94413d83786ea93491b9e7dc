Third-placed Greensharks hope to catch up with Kenya Hockey Union (KHU) Premier League run away leaders Kenya Police when they tackle Technical University tomorrow at City Park Stadium. Greensharks floored Nakuru Club last weekend to level their tally with second-placed Butali Warriors, who they are likely to topple when they face off with the struggling Technical University. Sharks will have to do without inspirational midfielder Victor Osiche who is in the national team training ahead of the Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt. If Sharks pick the three points, they will move to the second slot with 36 points. The match will pave way for Kenyatta University, who face Chase Sailors at City Park in another men’s Premier League. Chase will be disadvantaged by the absence of their talisman George Mutira, who is also engaged with the national team for the Afcon duty. Wazalendo contest for three points against Kenya College of Accountancy (KCA) University in the final men’s Premier League match of the day. Wazalendo will also have to do without their key defender Kennedy Munialo who is with the national team. Today, Chase Amira tackle Multimedia University in the women’s Premier League at City Park. Amira will miss their striker Pauline Naise who is with the ladies national team. Kenyatta University entertain their fellow students JKUAT at the same venue. In the National league, Dedan Kimathi play Multimedia University while Bay Club host Karate Axiom in Kisumu. Kabarak University take on University of Nairobi while Kisumu Youngsters play Karate Axiom on Sunday in their final Kisumu double.
