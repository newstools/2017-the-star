IEBC CEO Ezra Chiloba has denied claims by Suna East MP Junet Mohamed that he was still manning the Thursday's repeat presidential poll. In a tweet, Chiloba said the statement was reckless and can divide the nation further. The National Super Alliance urged its followers not to take part in the repeat poll. "I wish I could see myself as powerful as Junet Mohamed does...misleading claims can only but polarize country further," Chiloba said. Junet, who is also ODM director of elections, claimed that the IEBC CEO was frantically calling ROs across the country to fake results. The MP had spent the day in Opposition leader Raila Odinga's home before he made the remarks targeting Chiloba. Chiloba took a three-week leave and was away during today's repeat presidential election. Sources at IEBC said the CEO had reached the decision to be away in order to build confidence among stakeholders. But NASA leaders, during a rally in Kisii, said Chiloba's resignation was only meant to hoodwink them to take part in the election. Raila even claimed that the official was still reporting to the office to deal with preparations for the fresh presidential election. Following the standoff, the Opposition leader said the coalition will now be transformed into a resistance movement. He asked his supporters to stay away from polling stations on Thursday.' "We will convene and agree on a way to ensure that a fresh free and fair election is organised within 90 days," he said at Uhuru Park on Wednesday. "We call upon our supporters not to vote and to convince their neighbours not to take part in the poll because it is a Jubilee election," he said. Raila reiterated the boycott threat saying there are many ways to kill a cat - in reference to his bid to oust Uhuru. He said the people should take instructions to boycott newspapers, TV stations, products and services in their bid for change in Kenya.
