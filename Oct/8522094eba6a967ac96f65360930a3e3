Kisumu residents broke into song and dance on Friday after IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati postponed elections earlier slated for Saturday. They said the move came as a relief as it will save them the agony of running battle with police who have been dealing with protests in the town. The town is NASA leader Raila Odinga support base and has seen deployment of large number of police officers in an attempt to hold elections. The Opposition leader asked his backers to stay off the election, a move that has seen residents block polling stations to prevent the vote. IEBC said it will not hold elections in at least 25 constituencies in Nyanza citing grounds of violence which has risked lives of poll officials. Chebukati said the commission will declare new dates when the elections will be held as required by the law. Protests marred elections in Alego Usonga, Awendo, Bondo, Gem, Ugenya, Homa Bay Town,
Kabondo, Karachuonyo, Kasipul, Kisumu Central, Kisumu East, Kisumu West,
and Muhoroni. Ndhiwa, Suba North, Nyakach, Nyatike, Rongo, Rarieda, Suba South, Suna East, Suna West, Nyando, Seme, and Ugunja were affected.
