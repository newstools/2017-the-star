NASA protesters reutrned to Kisumu's streets in their hundreds on Monday in a demand for reforms before the fresh presidential election. As has become tradition, they carried a mock coffin of IEBC chief executive Ezra Chiloba, lit fires and barricaded roads as anti-riot police watched from a distance. NASA wants Chiloba to resign for allegedly taking part in malpractices in the August 8 general election. President Uhuru Kenyatta and NASA chief Raila Odinga are expected to meet again on October 26 following the Opposition's successful petition at the Supreme Court.  /FAITH MATETE The demonstrators waved placards with messages mocking IEBC, chanted 'Chiloba must go'and marched around Kisumu town. Nyando MP Fred Outa and woman representative Rosa Buyu led the mass action. The crowd met for about 10 minutes at Kondele roundabout where they were informed of routes to take to prevent clashes with police. Police said they will not engage them in running battles as witnessed last week. To prevent looting and destruction, some of the supporters said they will be on the lookout for goons.  /FAITH MATETE  /FAITH MATETE On Friday, NASA supporters broke into Tumaini Supermarket and stole items including food from the eatery during anti-IEBC protests.
