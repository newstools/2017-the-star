More than 500 members of the Kamba community living in Nakuru on Thursday ditched NASA for Jubilee. They pledged to back President Uhuru Kenyatta in the repeat polls on October 26. Led by their chairman Gerald Kilonzo, they said their decision was informed by the fact that they reside in Nakuru which is majorly a Jubilee zone. â€œIt was impossible for us to align ourselves with those in the eastern part of the country because they have different ideologies,â€ said Kilonzo. Kilonzo said that the community has formed committees in all the eleven sub-counties of Nakuru to drum up support for President Uhuru Kenyatta.

While echoing Kilonzoâ€™s sentiments, Anne Kingâ€™otole from Nakuru Town West said that they will use the resources they have to campaign for Uhuru's reelection. Nakuru deputy governor Dr Erick Korir and Nakuru county Jubilee party chairman David Manyara welcomed the new supporters to the party. The DG praised the members for their bold move and exuded confidence that the president will get many votes in the region. "You have made a bold move which will see the head of state score more votes come October 26," Korir said. Read: Governors who ditched Cord for Jubilee Party were greedy â€“ Rutto
