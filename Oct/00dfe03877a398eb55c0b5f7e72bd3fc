Nine students who were flagged off to China last week for a two-week language culture and ICT training are set to commence their programme as part of Huawei’s efforts for capacity building. The students settled in for their language and culture training at the Beijing Culture and Language University. This follows an opening ceremony that was officiated by the officer in charge of education at the Embassy of the Republic of Kenya in China, Reuben Augut. In addition to their training, the students will have an extensive city tour visiting the Great Wall of China, among other places, hence giving them an authentic experience of the Chinese history and culture. Speaking on behalf of the Kenyan Ambassador to China, Augut commended Huawei for taking practical steps in capacity development for Kenyan students. He also commended China for being in the lead in terms of ICT and development and urged the students to export and implement the skills learned back to Kenya. After completing the language and culture training, the nine will then proceed to the Huawei University in Shenzhen to receive training in cutting edge technology on 5G, LTE, and cloud computing whilst visiting the state of the art Huawei labs. The training will be done alongside their peers from Singapore and South Africa.
