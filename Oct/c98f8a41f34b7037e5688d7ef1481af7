Three IEBC officials have been charged with committing an election offence in Machakos county. Cecilia Mbula, Boniface Mutungi and Stephen Okoth were charged in a Kangundo court on Monday with breaching the Election Offences Act. The three worked with the IEBC as presiding officers in the August 8 General Election.  The court heard that on August 9, the three presented unsecured used and unused ballot papers to the constituency returning officer, in breach of their official duty. They allegedly did so at the National Industrial Training Authority in Athi River. The three denied the charges before Kangundo senior principal magistrate Desdarius Orimba. They were released on Sh300, 000 bond each or Sh100,000 bail. The case will be mentioned on October 19. Defence lawyers Daniel Mwamba and Otieno Javana asked to be supplied with the charge sheet and the witness statements to help prepare their defence.
