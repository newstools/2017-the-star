A person believed to be acting Interior CS Fred Matiang'i has been caught on tape threatening to unleash militia on people opposing the October 26 vote. In the audio recorded in the Kisii language, the person described himself as a member of Chinkororo and said he cannot be intimidated. "Whoever wants to stop you from voting here... I am the one in charge of security and I will ask the police to look the other side so that you beat him up." The person speaks during a rally attended by DP William Ruto. Noting members of the Gusii community live and work in several parts of the country, the man warned youths against heeding any call to sabotage the poll. He further told the people of South Mugirango never to be scared by anyone, as they have withstood attacks by Maasais. "You all know we have Chinkororo here and they are the ones protecting our border," he said. "What can someone tell me, a person who comes from the border? Is that what you want? Whoever is joking doesn't know Chinkororo. I am Enkororo from here." NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga announced on Wednesday that they will persist with mass action for "serious reforms" at IEBC and finish with major nationwide demonstrations on voting day. Raila noted their demands have not been met so they will carry on despite police use of bullets and tear gas. "Demonstrations will continue. October 26 will be the biggest demonstration of them all," he told a crowd of several thousand cheering supporters at Nairobi's Kamukunji grounds. "We have seen how police are brutally killing our people but we shall not be intimidated by a police force. Kenya is a free country and must be ruled by law and constitutionalism, not jungle law."
