Kenyans in the Diaspora sent home Sh17 billion in August, an increase of 9.26 per cent from July. According to data released by Central Bank of Kenya (CBK), Kenyans working abroad remitted back $166.4 million (Sh17.18 billion) in August compared to $152.7 million (Sh15.72 billion) the previous month. The August figure is the highest ever recorded since the regulator started to document diaspora remittances over 10 years ago. Back then, in January 2004, the first records of remittances were when the country received a paltry $25.1 million (Sh2.5 billion). Although diaspora remittances went up from a low of $138.6 million (Sh13.8 billion) in April this year to $161.5 (Sh16.1 billion) in May, it hit a downward curve the next two months. In June and July, CBK recorded $154.8 and $152.3 million respectively. Basing on a year-to-year records, the CBK data shows that the remittances from the diaspora grew by 13.4 per cent from Sh15.15 billion in 2016. Diaspora remittance is now Kenya’s leading foreign exchange earner after agricultural exports, with the total value of money sent by Kenyans living abroad rising to Sh177.34 billion last year from Sh159.82 billion the year before. It beat tea exports which earned the country about Sh124.5 billion. It has also surpassed horticulture whose export value stood at Sh101.51billion, according Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS). Early this year, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs report showed that Kenya got one Shilling from its citizens abroad for every three Shillings it got from exporting goods and services last year, with diaspora remittances at Sh170 billion and exports at Sh578.1 billion. Money sent from abroad by Kenyans has been key in shielding the local currency which is depreciating against top foreign currencies. Experts attribute the Shilling’s low performance to low export earnings which stood at 15.99 billion shillings in the month of June. This was a drop of 4.1 per cent from the 16.7 billion shillings that was realized in the month of May. The local currency is also affected by the country’s wide trade deficit that was put at Sh705 billion last year, the lowest posted in the past four years. This year, the country’s trade deficit is likely to go up, with latest data from KNBS showing that China alone is likely to cross the Sh400 billion export mark to Kenya.  A World Bank report indicates that Kenya is among the highest recipients of remittances in Africa. The bank however predicted that the remittances will grow at a slower rate this year, which will be the slowest in five years. “Remittances to Sub-Saharan Africa are projected to grow by a robust 10 per cent to $38 billion this year.  The region’s major remittance receiving countries, Nigeria, Senegal and Ghana, are all set for growth,” the World Bank said in a report.
