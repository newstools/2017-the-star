Police in Kirinyaga county on Tuesday retrieved the body of a university student who drowned while swimming. Samuel Nyaga, 21, was a first-year student at Kirinyaga University. Kirinyaga county police commander David Kirui (pictured) said Nyaga went swimming in the River Thiba, Kutus town. He said the river was swollen following the ongoing short rains. His friends tried to rescue him, but they too were overwhelmed. Nyagaâ€™s death comes just four month after another student from the same university drowned in the same river. The rescue operation was led by county deputy administration commander Mukiri Nyoke.
