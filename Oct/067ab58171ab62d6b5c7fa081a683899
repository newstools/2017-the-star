President Uhuru Kenyatta has called for a quick and thorough investigation into the cause of the fire at Nairobi’s biggest market. Uhuru said stern action will be taken against anyone found to be behind the incident at Gikomba. "Security agencies should move with speed to investigate the cause of the fire, and those believed to be behind the criminal act should face the full force of the law," he said at at Maua Stadium in Meru county on Friday. He noted the government stands with all traders who lost property and added the market will be rebuilt so activities resume. "The government will stand with affected traders by building the market to enable them continue with their business."

He said he is happy that some Meru residents, who had gone to court to block the government from releasing the Sh1 billion for miraa farmers, have agreed to withdraw the case. "Now that those who went to court have agreed to withdraw the case, it should be withdrawn as soon as possible to allow us to release the money." Last year, the government set aside Sh2 billion, in tranches of Sh1 billion each, to boost miraa farming in Kenya.
