Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu has told Jubilee supporters not to "fall prey to tricks" by opposition NASA by holding counter-demonstrations. Waititu told residents to keep off demos to counter NASA anti-IEBC protests and instead guard their property from destruction. “Do not join these protests since what NASA leader Raila Odinga is doing is to tempt you to demonstrate like his people. He wants to use this so that the international community can assist him to broker a caretaker government," Waititu said. "I also urge you to leave your businesses and farming activities on the 26th and vote for President Uhuru Kenyatta, since he is the only presidential candidate with a clear development agenda and a proven track record.” He spoke when they campaigned for Uhuru in Gatundu North constituency on Friday. Waititu was accompanied by MPs Wanjiku Kibe (Gatundu North), Peter Mwathi (Limuru), Jonah Mburu (Lari) and Githua wa Machukuru (Kabete) Wanjiku urged Gatundu North residents to turn out in large number on the voting day and show their love for Uhuru as they did on August 8. The constituency recorded a voter turnout of 86 per cent. Mburu said the only dialogue Kenyans want to hear is through their voice in the ballot. He said Jubilee will win since Raila has been dumped by most of the leaders and supporters. The leaders made stopovers in Gatukuyu, Mang’u, Kamwangi, Kanjuku, Kanyoni and Gakoe.
