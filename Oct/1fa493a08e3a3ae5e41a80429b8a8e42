Pedestrians have complained of fatal crashes along the Outering Road due to lack of footbridges. Most accidents have happened between Taj Mall and Donholm according to residents. “I have witnessed almost ten pedestrian deaths this month alone. There have been many more since this road was opened for use,” Tasia trader Ken Odunga said. Kenya Urban Roads Authority told the Star that they have started erecting footbridges across the busy highway. “We couldn’t erect the footbridges before the road was completed,” Cheboi said. NTSA statistics last month showed that a total of 843 pedestrians have been killed in Nairobi since January. Another 547 were seriously injured while 177 escaped with slight injuries. Outering Road is almost complete and was designed to have 11 footbridges. “Crossing the road is risky because it is very busy," another pedestrian said.
