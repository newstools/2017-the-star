The High Court in Nakuru has enjoined Jubilee Party in a petition where NASA has been sued by 12 voters seeking to bar their push for removal of IEBC officials from office. Justice Roslyn Korir in a ruling yesterday said JP has justified their case in seeking to be enjoined.  She said the application by Jubilee Party to be enjoined as an interested party in the case, was because their candidate will be greatly affected in the upcoming October 26 presidential election.  Jubilee advocate Brian Omuganda had argued that in the August presidential election, which was nullified by the Supreme Court on September 1, presidential candidates Ekuru Aukot and Michael Wainaina were enjoined in the petition, because they were involved in the election.  In the case, the 12 petitioners have listed the ODM, Wiper, Ford Kenya, ANC, the IEBC and its chairman Wafula Chebukati, the Registrar of Political Parties and the Attorney General as respondents. They also want the IEBC chairman restrained from forming the new special projects team to conduct the poll. In a notice of motion, the 12, through lawyer Mungai Kibe, have accused the opposition leaders of conspiring with the commissionâ€™s chairman to jeopardise the repeat election through the formation of the special project team which, they say is illegal. According to them, leaving the special project team to handle the election will only lead to the invalidation of the results, leading to a constitutional crisis. The petitioners have claimed NASA leaders want to force the commissioners out of office through a combination of political campaigns, demos and intimidation. They want the court to declare demands outlined by NASA on the â€œirreducible minimumâ€ null and void.
