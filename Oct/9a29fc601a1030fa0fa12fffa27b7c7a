Use mosquito nets to protect yourselves, not your crops, Uasin Gishu residents have been urged. “I have raised this issue in several meetings. If you use the nets for fencing farms, that might be punishable in the near future,” county director of health Evans Kiprotich said. He spoke at the launch of the distribution of free treated mosquito nets at Huruma County Hospital, Eldoret, on Monday. Kiprotich urged pregnant women, the elderly and children to go for the nets. He said malaria is one of the leading killer diseases.  The county and the National Malaria Control Programme came up with strategies to control the levels of infection. “We strategised to at least have people use appropriate prevention methods, which include sleeping under treated nets and strengthening advocacy so 80 per cent of the population have knowledge on malaria,” Kiprotich said.
