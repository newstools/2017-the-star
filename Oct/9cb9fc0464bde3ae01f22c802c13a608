Opposition leader Raila Odinga will lead his brigade to Kisii on Monday. Raila is expected to urge his voters not to turn up for Thursday's repeat presidential poll. He will tour Nyamira and Kisii counties where he will make stopovers at Nyansiongo, Kijauri market, Keroka and Keumbu accompanied by NASA co-principals. The Opposition leader has been rallying his supporters to boycott the October polls saying the results have already been pre-determined. On Sunday, Raila said NASA supporters will resume picketing at IEBC offices countrywide on Tuesday and Wednesday.  "We maintain that there will be no election on Thursday," he said in Bungoma. Raila's visit to the Gusii land comes just a week after his rival President Uhuru Kenyatta visited the area to rally his supporters ahead of the vote. The region, being a swing vote, was a major battle ground for Jubilee and NASA in August 8 general election. Read: Don't attack non residents, I will handle Uhuru, Raila tells Nyanza residents
