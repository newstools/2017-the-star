The IEBC should allow the
people of the four counties of Nyanza who do not want to vote to move on
without taking part in the repeat Presidential election.  The IEBC should read all the
signs that the people of Kisumu, Homa Bay, Siaya and Migori want no part in
this election.  Repeating the polls disrupted
by protestors on Thursday October 26 this weekend is simply asking for trouble.
 The protests could escalate,
the anti-riot police are still armed with live bullets and there are people who
are alive today who will be dead after the attempt to impose the rerun. Whatever else the law says,
the IEBC should spare Nyanza the injuries, destruction and deaths that will
certainly emerge if this bureaucratic insistence continues.  There is also the factor of
IEBC workersâ€™ safety of limb and life. When he announced the
transformation of NASA into the National Resistance Front on Wednesday Raila
Odinga claimed the government was out to massacre the people of Nyanza.
