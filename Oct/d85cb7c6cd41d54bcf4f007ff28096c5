Mau Mau war heroes have renewed their call to the Kiambu assembly to push the county government to build a monument in their honour. Led by Gitu Kahengeri, the war heroes calling themselves Shujaa wa Mau Mau made a courtesy call to the assembly, where they said they long to be recognised for their role in the struggle for independence. "We ask the Kiambu assembly to appreciate and recognise all those who fought for independence and record them for posterity,â€ he said. Kahengeri and his group has petitioned several county assemblies to pass laws that county governments erect monuments in strategic areas to fete war heroes. "We wonder why our streets and stadiums are being named after politicians and not war heroes. We should not forget our history," he said. In the first assembly, MCAs passed a motion tabled by the Social Services Committee chairman to have the county government honour the war heroes by preserving their history and building a monument. The monument is yet to be built. The war heroes also wants the assemblies to pass a law compelling county governments to pay them a pension to sustain their upkeep. Speaker Stephen Ndicho reaffirmed his commitment to have the war heroes recognised. "During my acceptance speech, I spelt out my plan to ensure this assembly recognises our founding fathers through the establishment of a hall of fame. I will ensure this is realised," he said.
