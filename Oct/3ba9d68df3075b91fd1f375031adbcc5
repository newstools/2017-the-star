Laikipia North MP Sara Korere yesterday told a court how former legislator Mathew Lempurkel assaulted her while attending a meeting at the Office of the President in November last year. Korere told Milimani senior resident magistrate Hellen Onkwani after a meeting to solve insecurity issues in Lakipia county with the Interior CS, Lempurkel confronted her, called her a prostitute and slapped her on the left cheek then kicked her in the lower abdomen. â€œAfter the meeting, Lempurkel who was not in attendance, stormed into the boardroom and confronted me... and asked me â€˜who has elected you to be bringing people to this office of the CSâ€™ ...,â€ she said. Korere denied there being any bad blood between her and Lempurkel, adding she does not know why the former MP assaulted her. The court heard Lempurkel was not invited to the meeting and was organised by MCAs who wanted to meet the CS and discuss the rise in insecurity in Laikipia North and parts of Laikipia West. Korere further informed the court that during the commotion, they were separated by three people and immediately officers from Harambee House came to her rescue and escorted her to report the mater at Parliament police station before she sought treatment at Nairobi Womenâ€™s Hospital. The lawmaker informed the court that she still suffers from lower abdominal pain from time to time. She said on Novermber 22 last year, she received a message from an unknown number telling her to drop the matter.
