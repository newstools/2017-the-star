The chairmen of government owned sugar companies from Western and Nyanza  are seeking attention and assurance of President Uhuru Kenyatta to end the poaching menace which is threatening the industry. Led by Nzoia Sugar company chairman Joash Wamang'oli, the representatives have raised concern over the continued poaching of their canes from private millers claiming if the trend is not stopped the sugar industry will collapse. Speaking to the press yesterday (Monday) in Bungoma town Wamang'oli said they were planning to meet the president  to raise the poaching menace and the sugar levy which was also grappling the government owned millers. He said after the ministry of agriculture removed the zoning  in the sugar sector the factories are facing serious poaching of their cane by private millers. ''After the ministry of agriculture and other regulators like Agriculture Fisheries and Food Authority[AFFA] removed the issue of zoning in sugar regions it has became a free market and our contracted farmers are selling the crop to any one'' regretted Wamang'oli. He said as the chairmen they were ready to meet the president and address the matter to salvage the industry from collapsing. He said that millions of sugarcane farmers are slated to lose livelihoods if the factories will close down because of the poaching menace. ''Farmers will be the greatest casualties if the government doesn’t take a rapid step to end the beckoning treaty'' he said. Wamang'oli also said they wanted the president to order the ministry of Agriculture to allow the factories to deduct fuel levy from farmers. He said the levy used to assist the factories develop canes and undertake many other activities. ''We shall be unable to run if the government will not allow factories themselves to deduct fuel levy from its contracted farmers'' said Wamang'oli. He said companies are unable to service and maintain their machines because the money they used to do such works were from fuel levy.
