Education CS Fred Matiang'i has assured Kenyans of security during the conduct of KCPE and KCSE examinations. The CS spoke on Tuesday morning when he supervised the distribution of KCPE papers in Makueni county. Matiang'i was accompanied by Health CS Cleopa Mailu. The two witnessed the opening of the storage container for Makueni sub-county exams in Wote town. He said the ministry has such containers across the country to facilitate the timely and smooth delivery of examination materials. "This year, we have bought 46 examination storage containers for the examinations to reach respective centres at the correct time." "We have also moved starting time from 8am to 8.30am to ensure timely distribution of the exams to the centres," Matiang'i said.
