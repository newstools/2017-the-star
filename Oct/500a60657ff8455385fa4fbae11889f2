NASA supporters in Kajiado town did not hold anti-IEBC demonstrations on Monday after chiefs told them to keep off. At least 20 opposition sympathisers waited in a resort club in the town for nearly seven hours to hear from Kajiado Central MP Elijah Memusi and nominated Senator Judy Pareno. In the evening the two politicians spoke to journalists at Empeut Resort Club. Memusi said there wereas no plans for demos in Kajiado on Monday and urged their supporters to turn up in large numbers on Friday. â€œThere will be a mother of all demos in Kajiado on Friday. Police should keep off the streets,â€ Memusi said. Pareno said NASA is unstoppable. She said every IEBC official who is alleged to have been involved in electoral should be arrested and charged. At the same time, more than 80 Kajiado chiefs held a two-hour meeting and resolved to defend county commissioner Harsama Kello against attacks by Memusi. The chiefs dismissed Memusiâ€™s claims that Kello will sack chiefs who do not campaign for President Uhuru Kenyatta.
