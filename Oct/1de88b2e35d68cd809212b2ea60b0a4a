Sadio Mane was named in Senegal’s 25-man squad for their final World Cup qualifiers next month, even though his club Liverpool said last week the winger would be out for up to six weeks. Senegal, who need two points to qualify for next year’s finals in Russia, play South Africa away in Polokwane on Nov. 10 and then at home in Dakar on Nov. 14. “Sadio Mane has resumed individual training and will probably resume full training next week,” Senegal coach Aliou Cisse told a news conference. Mane hurt his hamstring in Senegal’s last Group D game -- a 2-0 away win over the Cape Verde Islands on Oct. 7, after which Liverpool said the injury “could keep him out of action for up to six weeks.” Senegal have stuck with the same squad that beat the Cape Verdians, including West Ham United striker Diafra Sakho who returned to the national team and scored in the victory in Praia. However, there was once again no recall for Stoke City’s Mame Biram Diouf. Meanwhile, former African Footballer of the Year Rabah Madjer has been appointed Algeria’s new coach after Spaniard Lucas Alcaraz was fired on Wednesday, the country’s football federation has said. The 58-year-old returns for a third spell after being away from coaching for more than a decade, working instead as a television analyst. He was in charge of Algeria from April 1994 to July the following year, and then again for nine matches from July 2001 to May 2002. His last coaching job was in 2006 at Al Rayyan in Qatar. As a player, Madjer won the European Cup in 1987 when his cheeky backheel helped FC Porto beat Bayern Munich. He was crowned Africa’s best player for that year. Alcaraz departs after failing to reverse Algeria’s fortunes in 2018 World Cup qualifiers, where they are without a win after five matches.
