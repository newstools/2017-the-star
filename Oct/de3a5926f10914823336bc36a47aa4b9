Officers from Nema in Mandera yesterday arrested 10 people for violating the plastic bag ban law. County environment director Josiah Nyandoro told the Star the 10 were arrested in Takaba subcounty. He said nobody will be spared in the crackdown. Nyandoro said he has prepared charge sheets and the 10 will be charged in Moyale law courts today. The accused persons risk an imprisonment of between one and four years, or a fine of between Sh2 million and Sh4 million.  The neighbouring countries of Ethiopia and Somalia pose a big challenge towards the implementation of the plastic bags ban. The two countries still use plastic bags and traders from Kenya get them from across the border. The plastic bag ban came into effect on August 28. Kenya has joined at least 40 other countries, including China, Rwanda, South Africa, Eritrea, France and Italy that have either banned or regulated the use of plastic bags. Kenya’s plastics ban policy is one of the world’s toughest laws aimed at reducing pollution. The government is also contemplating banning plastic bottles once it is done dealing with the plastic bag menace. Kenyans have been blamed for their poor behavior of carelessly disposing of plastic bags and bottles anywhere. Data from the Environment ministry shows that approximately 50 million bottles are used annually countrywide. If implemented, the ban will have a negative impact on companies that package drinks in plastic bottles.
