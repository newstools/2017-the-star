Poor drainage in Kiambu that has led to stagnant waters is frustrating traders in the town, an MCA has said. Lari Kirenga MCA Joseph Karichu said traders have been forced to abandon many prime areas where they can sell their wares because of stagnant waters and bushes that need to be cleared. He said unblocking the drainage and clearing the bushes will help the county manage urban centres. “There are drainage that blocked years ago. They produce
bad smell and breed mosquitoes,” Karichu said. "We want to clean our trading centres to ensure traders work in a clean environment," he added. He was speaking on Monday at Nyambare trading center in his
ward, just three days after welcoming Governor Ferdinand Waititu to witness blocked
drainage. Waititu said the county will improve working
conditions of traders in all centres. He asked residents to help the county with ideas
on what they would want done. Waititu observed that Nyambare did not have floodlights despite being a vibrant trading centre. “We don’t want to hear traders closing their simply because darkness has fallen," Waititu said.
