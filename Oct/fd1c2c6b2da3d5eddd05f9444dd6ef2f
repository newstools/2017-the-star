Land grabbers invaded a 24-acre farm in Kanamai, Kilifi, on Saturday, leaving behind a trail of horror and a terrified family. Raiders slashed a worker’s face with a panga, beat him and stabbed his leg. Richard Kenga (pictured), the family’s mechanic, said more than 30 people ambushed him. “I can identifythose who beat me,” he said. However, the owners of the farm repulsed the invaders. No one was shot.  The land belongs to the family of the late Tima Abdallah. Grabbers have been hiving off parts of it. The family is now living in fear. Ironically, the family claims the attackers were raised and educated by the deceased. Kurt Henry, a family member, told journaliststhe invaders came around 9pm armed with bows and poisoned-tipped arrows.  “We called police. We demolished a house they had started building and a fence they were erecting,” he said. He added, “We are very afraid for our lives. We don’t know what will happen. They are demanding five acres. This is our rightful property, we can’t give it to them.” Land grabbing in Kilifi is increasing. The family said they have been raised on the farm. A tearfuy Mary Thaddey said they have no other home and they have the documents to prove the land belongs to them. When reporters visited the farm, they found plainclothes officers. â€‹ “Why should people grab our land and attack our worker? This is inhumane. We brought up those people who attacked us,” she said. Thaddey said they allowed women to cultivate plots and collect firewood on their farm.
