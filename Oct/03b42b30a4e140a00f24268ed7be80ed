Migori youth and police clashed on Wednesday as NASA supporters tried to prevent voting materials from being delivered to polling centres for the presidential rerun. The youth barricaded roads with stones, electric poles and vehicles in major towns. A bonfire was lit on Migori bridge. Migori county stadium and Migori Muslim Primary School in Suna East constituency, which are only 600 metres from Migori police headquarters, were at the centre of the clashes.  In Suna West, the youth kept vigil at Oruba and Assar Primary Schools to prevent ballots from being moved from the county tallying centre at Migori TTC. Uriri IEBC returning officer Benson Ambuko said he was stuck with ballot boxes at 9am at the subcounty commissioner’s offices.  Clerks, presiding officers and deputy presiding officers had not shown up by 1 pm.  Joseph Ng’eno, the Kuria West IEBC returning officer, said voting started at 6am.  All the 117 polling centres were openedand voting went on peacefully. “The turnout has been poor, but as the day progresses, we hope more will come. We will close the centres at 5pm and proceed with tallying in Kehancha town,” Ng’eno said. By 9am, there were no long queues.
