IEBC has called for the prosecution of Kandara MP Alice
Wahome for harassing an official on duty. A video emerged of Wahome and returning officer Martin Malonza disagreeing over changes to
Form 34B for the constituency. Wahome and Malonza push and pull over the signing of the form. "I was 10 minutes away from the centre when my agents called, alerting me that Malonza had refused to let them sign. I called the RO to ask him to wait for me but he did not pick so I asked my agents to delay the process," she told The Star. "He then took the forms and wrote a report that they had not signed and transmitted the results without the signatures. This is when I arrived and it's from there that the video is recorded."

punished." Wahome said she wanted to
verify the results of Jubilee Party candidate Uhuru Kenyatta because a whole stream
of 440 votes had not been included. According to the elections offenses
Act, 2016 anyone who obstructs or hinders an officer from discharging duty has committed an offence. "A person who obstructs
or hinders any elections officer, candidate or agent in the execution of their
lawful duties commits an offence and is liable, on conviction, to a fine not
exceeding five hundred thousand," the law states.
