The Kisii county assembly has become the first in Nyanza to approve names of County Executive Committee members. Siaya MCAs rejected nine out of the 10 names presented by Governor Cornel Rasanga while Kisumu’s Anyang’ Nyong’o is yet to forward names of his nominees to the assembly. Homa Bay and Migori MCAs are yet to start vetting nominees. In Homa Bay, vetting failed to take place last week for lack of funds while in Migori, it has been delayed by the standoff over the speaker. The Migori assembly is on recess until further notice, after the election of speaker was interrupted. The Nyamira county assembly began vetting Governor John Nyagarama’s nominees yesterday. The County Governments (Amendment) (No2) Act, 2016 stipulates that new county executive members shall be appointed within 21 days after swearing-in of MCAs. In Kisii, the 10 nominees are expected to be sworn in this week. Governor James Ongwae dropped six executives who served in his first term and retained four.
