Mathare MP Anthony Oluoch on Friday was discharged from the Nairobi Hospital after he was injured by suspected goons at Sarova Panafric Hotel on Thursday. He said he suffered soft tissue injuries in the head, neck and limb and ribs during the assault captured on camera. “They did a CT scan and an X-ray. Luckily, I did not suffer any serious injuries. I got some injections and regimens, crutches and hand sling to suspend the injured limb,” Oluoch said. The MP said the goons descended on him with blows and kicks after a scuffle between NASA and Jubilee legislators over IEBC’s conduct during the Thursday repeat presidential election. “They are well known criminals recruited and armed with guns. I have reported to police,” he said. He said he has their full names and the their images are recorded on camera.
