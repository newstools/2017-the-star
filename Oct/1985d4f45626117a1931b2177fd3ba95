A man among beneficiaries of millions of shillings in land compensation for Thiba dam site has reportedly been hacked to death by his wife. It is believed the wife of Peter Muthike, a 40-year-old from Kianjiru village in Kirinyaga East sub-county, used a blunt object to kill him. Neighbours said the two had a troublesome marriage and that they squabbled almost daily. Muthike's brother Micairu narrated on Friday events that followed a phone call at about 2am about the death. "My brotherâ€™s wife called me many times from 2am urging me to go to their home as something was terribly wrong," he told the press at the scene. He said he left his house at about 5am and reached his destination at 6am. "I met my sister-in-law at the gate with their standard six son. She asked me to escort her to Kianyaga police station to make a report about the sudden death of my brother." Micairu declined, wondering what he would tell the police yet he had not seen the body.  He did not accompany the woman to the station. Upon further interrogation, it emerged the couple had a bitter quarrel on Thursday night and that it escalated into a fight. The woman returned to her home with police but met a hostile crowd that beat her before the officers managed to pull her away. They drove her back to the station and accused her or murdering her husband. Officers discovered the woman had changed her clothes and stashed them in a gunny bag inside the house. Muthike's body lay on the floor next to their bed. It was taken to Kibugi mortuary in Kutus town. The suspect was arrested for investigations.
