The MP, through
lawyer Wahome Gikonyo, on Friday told Justice Jairus Ngaah at the High Court in Nyeri that
the petition filed by Michael Gichuru was misconceived and had no merit. He said the
petitioner failed to indicate whether he is a registered voter in the
constituency. The
petitioner wants the MPâ€™s election nullified, arguing that the polls were marred
by irregularities and the exercise was not transparent, accurate and credible
as required by the Constitution. The pre-trial conference is scheduled for tomorrow.
