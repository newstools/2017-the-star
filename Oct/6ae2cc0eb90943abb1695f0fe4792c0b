Legislators Charles Njagua and Babu Owino fought at Parliamentâ€™s media centre yesterday, forcing sergeants-at-arms to intervene. It is not clear why the Starehe and Embakasi East MPs resorted to blows, but journalists at the centre said Njagua followed Babu after he walked in. A few minutes to 3pm, Babu walked to the Media Centre â€” the section that hosts the head of media relations. He greeted journalists.  The reporters said Babu had been chatting with them when his counterpart grabbed him from the back and started pulling him while yelling. It was then that a confrontation ensued. Njagua is a singer and goes by the stage name Jaguar. Babu is a former UoN student union leader. â€œWe heard Jaguar shout: â€˜You cannot do that to the President. He is not a caretaker Presidentâ€™,â€ one of the journalists said. The two newly elected MPs were held in the chambers Babu angered Jubilee supporters after he allegedly referred to President Uhuru Kenyatta as â€˜mtoto wa mbwaâ€™. He was charged with subversion, insulting Uhuru and incitement to violence.  Babu denied the charges. He spent two nights in police cells and was eventually released on Sh200,000 bail.
