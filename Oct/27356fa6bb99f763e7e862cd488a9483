A court yesterday warned the prosecution in Bishop Gilbert Deyaâ€™s child theft case not to delay the hearing. Deya was charged in August with stealing five children under the age of 14. State counsel Nicholas Mutuku had asked the court to interpret its ruling on hearing dates. He said the court had said the case should be heard on daily from October 9. The High Court had said the case should be heard and determined in 120 days. Mutuku wanted interpretation on whether the case will be heard during weekends and public holidays, including Election Day. Lawyer Fred Ngatia asked the court not to allow the prosecution the opportunity to keep his client in remand by delaying the case further. In his ruling, chief magistrate Francis Andayi said he found it mischievous that the prosecution never raised the concerns on the numerous occasions the case was mentioned. Andayi directed that the case proceeds for hearing on a day-to-day basis from yesterday.
