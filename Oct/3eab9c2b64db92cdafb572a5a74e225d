JUST what is opposition leader Raila Odingaâ€™s â€œno electionâ€ game plan? Many Kenyans are asking what Railaâ€™s secret card could be with his insistence that there will be no election on October 26. Even his closest allies are said to be fumbling and every time they are questioned they allude to a secret weapon. Is Raila working on something that catch get even his buddies flatfooted? CALL it playing the game the best way you know how. Well, acting Interior CS Fred Matiangâ€™i was in his best element on Thursday, when President Uhuru Kenyatta campaigned in the Cabinet Secretaryâ€™s native Kisii region. The no-nonsense CS plunged into the uncharted waters of politics, explaining why the community needs to give Uhuru another term in office. Non-characteristically of him, Matiangâ€™i spoke at length in Ekegusii and often psyched up supporters who thronged the rallies. The CS even chided the opposition, saying he would deal ruthlessly with those who break the law. Isnâ€™t this misuse/betrayal of the public trust? Have Cabinet Secretaries assumed the role of political party wingers against the law? These are the questions lingering in the minds of many Kenyans. ============= IS the government aware of a syndicate fleecing parents of their money in the guise of tuition fees? Well, some primary schools in Nairobi are employing all sorts of means to collect illicit levies from innocent parents. A public school in Kasarani sub-county has gone to the extreme and has devised better ways to do that. The school, situated a few kilometres to Mwiki town and only a stoneâ€™s throw away from the sub-county director of education, has become a menace. The head teacher has reportedly helped all teachers, mostly women, to acquire cars. She is even charging toilet fees for pupils. Is each child asked to pay Sh150 per month for sewage services? Isnâ€™t this exploitation and why cannot the ministry take action? ============= ARE Jubilee propagandists behind claims that ODM Treasurer Timothy Bosire was on Thursday scheduled to join Jubilee during President Uhuru Kenyattaâ€™s tour of the region? The news of his â€˜impendingâ€™ crossover spread as fast as a bushfire in what could have been an enormous catch for Jubilee. That Jubilee agents have been waylaying the vocal former Kitutu Masaba MP is in no doubt. One of the Jubilee lawmakers from the region is said to have been behind the â€˜fake newsâ€™ on Thursday night. But as a staunch supporter of Raila Odinga, Bosire says he is in NASA for the long haul. â€œNASA is where I belong and no amount of blackmail will force me to succumb to Jubileeâ€™s schemes,â€ Bosire said.
