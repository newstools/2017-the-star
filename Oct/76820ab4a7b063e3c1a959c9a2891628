Nyandarua leaders have said NASA leader Raila Odinga will never rule Kenya because â€œthe people have refused himâ€. Governor Francis Kimemia, speaker Wahome Ndegwa, Senator Githiomi Mwangi, woman representative Faith Gitau, MP Jeremiah Kioni (Ndaragwa), Michael Muchira (Ol joro orok), David Kiaraho (Ol kalou), Amos Kimunya (Kipipiri) and Zachary Kwenya (Kinangop) spoke in Kinangop yesterday as they campaigned for President Uhuru Kenyatta. They also criticised opposition chief Raila for calling mass protests to demand changes to the IEBC and stop changes to electoral laws ahead of the October 26 repeat election. The legislators said opposition leaders â€œshould not think they have a monopoly of mass actionâ€, adding it is only because Jubilee leaders and their followers value peace that they are not out in the streets. â€œBut they should not think we are afraid of them. President Uhuru and his Deputy William Ruto have vowed there will be no bloodshed in Kenya as people fight for leadership. But the others led by Raila Odinga appear to have vowed there must be bloodshed every time there is an election,â€ Kimemia said He claimed Raila is a â€œtroublemaker who finds gratification in violenceâ€.
