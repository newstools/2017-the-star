Youths in Migori town on Friday engaged police in violent skirmishes after suspecting they wanted to move ballot materials for Saturday repeat polls. Three people, including a 12-year-old girl, were shot in Migori town. They were taken to Oruba Nursing Home. Riot police, especially from the General Service Unit, invaded homes in estates and harassed journalists as they tried to move through Migori town. At noon, youths who kept vigil in Migori town, started receiving social media alerts that police officers wanted to move ballot materials from the county IEBC offices to constituencies. Several lorries and pickups with police officers were spotted at the offices, a kilometre from Migori town. The youths barricaded the roads to prevent materials reaching Suna East, Suna West, Awendo, Rongo, Nyatike and Uriri constituencies. A police chopper flew close to the estates to help ground troops move through estates. KTN cameraman Rashid Abdalla was attacked by GSU officers who took a camera memory card, witnesses said. Radio Lake Victoria correspondent Basil Okoth was assaulted by GSU officers and rushed to St Joseph Ombo Mission Hospital. “In the morning, officers told us they were going to discipline us in the demonstrations and warned us to keep off,” Ebru TV cameraman Jesse Sikali said.
