Tea farmers from Murangâ€™a county have started building a Sh130 million factory to compete with the Kenya Tea Development Agency. Chairman Charles Kihara said the Kiriti tea factory will be built in Kagongo. He said they have received overwhelming support from farmers in Kangema subcounty, which has about 600 acres of tea. He spoke during the groundbreaking ceremony on Tuesday. Kihara said the idea to build a private factory arose after numerous fights and disagreements between farmers and KTDA. He said farmers who supply tea leaves to Mutunguru buying centre, Kangema, were forced to sell to private factories in Kiambu after their contracts with KTDA were cancelled. The farmers looked for alternative buyers after KTDA refused to collect their tea leaves for months in late 2014. This was punishment for failing to sign the controversial Green Leaf Supply Agreement. The farmers called the agreement draconian, stripping them of their rights by terming them suppliers instead of shareholders. They said they own the factories managed by KTDA. Kihara said the factory will be run by a 13-member management committee, and its equipment is being imported from China. He said it wasnâ€™t easy to get an operating licence from the Agriculture Food and Fisheries Authority. Kihara said sector players put up roadblocks to stop them from penetrating the industry, controlled by KTDA and international companies. Researcher Michael Gakungu said production is below par, with a bush producing half a kilo instead of the required two and a half kilos annually. Gakungu, who worked with KTDA for 34 years, said the government should put more effort into educating farmers on better cultivation to increase production.
