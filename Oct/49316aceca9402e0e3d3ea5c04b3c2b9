The Mombasa High Court has thrown out a petition against Jomvu MP Badi Twalib's election. Voter
Jimmy Kazungu sued Badi, IEBC and Jomvu returning
officer Nuru Faraj and wanted the court to declare
Badi's win null and void and order a fresh poll. He said the election was unfair and that it was marred with irregularities. In her ruling on Friday, judge Mugure Thande said
the petition did not meet the threshold to be heard as it contravened several rules. Thande further said it was incomplete as
the basis for any complaint was lacking and there were many other omissions.  She also said the petitioner did not comply with mandatory provisions of rule 8 of the election petition
rules of 2017. Rule eight stipulates that a petition
should contain a name, address, date of the disputed election, when the result was declared and the grounds for it. Thande said Kazungu's petition did not have the election date, his name and address. "He also failed to show when the
declaration of the results was done. He also omitted the name and address of his advocate," she said. The petitioner said these details were in a supporting affidavit, which he told the court to accept as part of the petition. Thande refused to do this, saying amendments were a must, but noted the window for this closed 28 days after the results were declared, as stated in law. "The petition is therefore defective
and therefore struck out," she announced. Kazungu will now bear the costs of both
the application and the petition. More on MP: Two Jomvu MP losers to challenge Twalib’s election victory
