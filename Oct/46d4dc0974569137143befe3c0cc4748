The Treasury has released Sh3.9 billion for drought interventions between September to December. The National Drought Management Authority said on Tuesday the fund will be used for water, food, safety nets, livestock, agriculture, health and nutrition, peace, security and coordination. The bulletin states the drought conditions remain critical in Garissa, Isiolo, Kajiado, Kilifi, Marsabit, Narok, Samburu, Tana River, and Wajir counties.  There is an acute water crisis, low milk production, low livestock prices and livestock are dying. Last month, the Kenya Red Cross Society said 3.4 million Kenyans are in dire need of food aid. Abbas Gullet (pictured), the KRCS secretary general said despite the short rains, arid and semi-arid counties are still facing acute food shortage. In September, the authority disbursed a further Sh88 million of drought contingency financing, bringing the total for the 2017-18 financial year to Sh169 million. “A further Sh57 million of emergency cash transfers was also approved to benefit 21,064 households in Turkana and Wajir counties with the support of UKAid,” the bulletin said. NDMA has recommended fast-tracking the implementation of drought response measures, particularly since the period just before the start of the rainy season is the most difficult for the ASAL region. “Special attention should be given to reducing malnutrition and mitigating livestock mortality,” the authority said.
