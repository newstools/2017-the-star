Kirinyaga Governor Ann Waiguru has said that the only way for President Uhuru Kenyatta and his political rival Raila Odinga to solve their dispute is only the ballot. She urged residents to turn out in big numbers to vote for Uhuru on Thursday. Raila has said he will boycott the repeat polls.  She spoke during a meeting for the Jubilee Women Brigade for Embu County. Also present were Public service Cabinet Secretary Sicily Kariuki and Nominated MP Cecily Mbarire among others. The meeting took place at Canan Resort in Embu Town and was attended by more than 500 women. “On October 26 we are saying is the end of the dialogue. I want to tell those asking the president to dialogue that this country has laws and constitution which show that we are a democratic country. The constitution does not say that two contenders should sit and decide who to be the president,” she said The leaders at the same time hit out at former IEBC Commissioner Roselyn Akombe who fled to New York before she resigned from her job. They accused her of having worked with NASA to sabotage the August 8 presidential election leading to its nullification. Waiguru said even her resignation and escape was a deal she had planned with NASA to paint a bad image of the country.
