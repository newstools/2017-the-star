Opposition supporters attacked two journalists during NASA's parliamentary group meeting at Wiper's office on Tuesday. Citizen's Francis Gachuri was roughed up and threatened with a beating while an NTV videographer was slapped. They were rescued by journalists, some who walked out of the meeting at the offices of Kalonzo Musyoka's party, to show their support. The parliamentary group meeting was then called off.

"I am under siege. The goons are now threatening to torch Citizen's observation van," Gachuri told The Star on phone during the incident. He said journalists and media houses were being profiled.

"I must say what I saw was unfortunate, barbaric and archaic," he said. "On behalf of NASA, I apologise for the attack on my brother Gachuri and on my sister Jane of NTV. I am very disturbed." He said they will issue a statement on the matter and the youths involved will be reprimanded. Raila, who is Opposition leader, warned politicians against "taking goodies" from the Jubilee administration.
