Three people, including a 73-year-old woman, were shot during NASA demonstrations in Migori town on Friday. They were shot after demonstrators moved about 700 metres from the IEBC's office to Posta Grounds. A crowd had been preparing to burn two mock coffins with dogs inside, representing IEBC CEO Ezra Chiloba and acting Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i. Riot police fired live bullets and tear gas at the crowd hitting Boniface Ombima, 32, a boda boda rider taking food to pupils at Babyshine Academy. "I was taking lunch to pupils stuck at the school during lunch hour when a bullet hit me on right leg. I noticed blood and bystanders shouted that I had been shot." He spoke to journalists at Migori Level Four Hospital where he was taken. The granny was rushed to St Joseph Mission Hospital and the third person to Akidiva Hospital in Migori town. Motorists parked PSVs at Migori police station while business owners kept their doors locked.  NASA supporters in Migori town pray for a dead stray dog they called 'Matiang'i' at a funeral service' outside IEBC's regional office, October 13, 2017. /MANUEL ODENY MATIANG'I, CHILOBA 'TURNED INTO GHOSTS' The Opposition supporters killed the two stray dogs and created the mock coffins after converging for a march through town. The dogs had been following the demonstrators when they were cornered and killed by people who used crude weapons. The crowd carried the carcasses and the two coffins and marched through the town to IEBC's office where a 'funeral' took place. The Opposition supporters overran riot police, signed condolences books, sang dirges and prayed for the "departed souls". A planned 'funeral service' did not take place on October 2 as police repulsed demonstrators by firing in the air. Suna West MP Peter Masara said: "We are telling Chiloba that according to the Luo culture, if your funeral is organised while you are still alive and you are buried, then you remain a ghost, a persona-non grata. We don't want any ghost organising election." Masara said the demonstrations, which started at 7am and attracted large crowds, showed Matiang'i's ban on protests is null and void.  â€‹Anti-IEBC demonstrators in Migori town with the mock coffin for IEBC CEO Ezra Chiloba during NASA demonstrations on October 13, 2017. /MANUEL ODENY Persona non-grata is the term Mvita MP Abdulswamad Nassir used to describe the CS when he rebuked him in Mombasa earlier today.

We buried him too and his order here today." Demonstrators said that from next Monday they will take to the streets every day, chant slogans against Jubilee Party and call for a boycott of the repeat election on October 26. NASA candidate Raila Odinga and his running mate Kalonzo Musyoka have withdrawn from the race and demanded a fresh process.

Most of the men sustained leg and hand injuries in the protesters that rendered Kisumu a ghost town. They were taken to Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital. Roads around the central business district were blocked and journalists were not spared as riot police teargassed them. In Kondele, eight canisters were fired at journalists covering the mass action, officers reiterating that they do not want the media to cover the events. Among journalists attacked on October 9 were Standard Media photographer Denish Ochieng; Nation Media's Ouko Okusa, Rushdie Oudia and Dorine Magak; KBC's Simon Achola and The Star's Faith Matete.

Odhiambo has raised the matter with Kisumu county police boss Titus Yoma. He wants an explanation on why the officers assaulted journalists. “We want to know the nature of offences we committed as journalists. These acts must stop because reporters cannot be intimidated from doing their work.' More on this: NASA demos: Police turn wrath on Kisumu journalists, teargas crowds
