Early one morning, we found some lions near Junction 10A, not far from the murram heaps. The lions appeared to be very full, no doubt as a result of overnight feasting on a fresh buffalo killed the previous day.  We sat and observed two lionesses for a while, and then suddenly, a magnificent lion lifted his head from under a nearby tree.  After closer observation we identified him as Sirua. As he lay panting in the shade of the tree, I noticed something lying behind him. After looking carefully with binoculars, it appeared to be a young antelope. Just then another vehicle arrived. I decided to move forward a bit to allow them an opportunity to view. However, this vehicle had a loud engine that they left running while viewing the lion.  Sirua must have been irritated by this noise, as he suddenly stood up and grabbed the young antelope, and walked across the road with his prize. I managed to get a few photos while observing that the prey was actually a newborn Kongoni lamb ( cokes hartebeest ).  The lion already had a very full belly from feasting on the buffalo kill, so there was actually no need to kill again because of hunger. It is difficult to use human logic to understand lion behavior. However, it is possible that this lion saw the newborn lamb and could not resist the temptation of killing it for an after-feast dessert snack.  So while Sirua walked off in triumph with his tender prize, it is also a tragedy that this young calf never even experienced life on earth. But such is the instinctive survival nature of wild lions, as survival of the fittest is the seemingly harsh law of nature.
