A gospel singer has urged President Uhuru Kenyatta, NASA flagbearer Raila Odinga and the IEBC to come together and end their stalemate ahead of the presidential rerun. Christine Auma (pictured) made the appeal while addressing the congregation at Seed of Abraham Christian Centre in Ruambwa, Budalangâ€™i constituency, on Sunday. She underscored the importance of peace and urged leaders to promote cohesion to avert chaos. â€œPeace is a very essential element in our day-to-day life. I want to appeal to all elected leaders to be at the forefront in the promotion of peaceful coexistence during the campaigns ahead of the October 26 presidential rerun,â€ Auma said. She urged all religious leaders to pray for peace. â€œThe church should pray. I believe God will guide Kenyans on what political direction to take,â€ she said, appealing to the media to be fair and objective in their reporting.
