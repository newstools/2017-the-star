Deputy President William Ruto is this weekend expected at the Coast for a second time since the nullification of President Uhuru Kenyatta's win. On September 1, the Supreme Court declared the August presidential election null and void and ordered fresh polls within 60 days. The Coast has 1,714,116 registered voters. It is an important vote basket that Jubilee Party has been trying to win over. Opposition leader Raila Odinga enjoys a fanatic following in the region. On the August 8 poll results, Uhuru garnered 287,606 votes in the six counties of the region.  Raila got 801,031 votes. Jubilee leaders have insisted it is possible for Uhuru to win more votes in the region in the repeat presidential election on October 26.  Raila has not yet set foot in the region, since the nullification of the election. He was last in the region on August 22, during the inauguration ceremony of Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho.
