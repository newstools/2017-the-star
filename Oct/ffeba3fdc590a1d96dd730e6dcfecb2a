Starehe MP Charles Njagua has apologised to his constituents following Tuesday's fist fight with Babu Owino of Embakasi East. Sergeants at arms had to separate the two. [VIDEO] Drama as Babu Owino, Jaguar fight in Parliament Njagua, popularly known as musician Jaguar, is said to have asked Babu to stop insulting the presidency before the fight. He apologised citing his counterpart's alleged reference to President Uhuru Kenyatta as mtoto wa mbwa. "Starehe people didn't elect me to fight in Parliament," he said on Wednesday but claimed Babu is "going through depression and needs counselling". Njagua promised to "square it out" with Babu if he continues to insult Uhuru and the presidency. "Babu should stop insulting the President. If he does not, we also know how to insult. We are youthful leaders, we will square it out." The legislator said Babu's reaction, after he approached him with his warning, provoked him to act. He said he is ready to appear before a House disciplinary committee to defend himself.  The politician addressed the press flanked by Embakasi Central MP Benjamin Mwangi who was also involved in yesterday's incident.
