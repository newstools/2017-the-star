Kuppet has urged an independent probe into the interdiction of five Marakwet teachers who allegedly deserted duty after they were attacked by students. Teachers at St Augustine Secondary School Kapyego, Marakwet East, were interdicted early this month after they allegedly boycotted work. They are said to have been attacked twice by students since July. Elgeyo Marakwet branch Kuppet secretary John Chesergon on Sunday said the decision to interdict the teachers was unfair.  “There were no investigations carried out before the drastic action was taken. We are demanding rescinding of the interdiction and independent investigations,” Chesergon said.
