Google has launched a faster, more affordable web browser to be available to users via Google App, Chrome and Android browser. This is good news to millions of internet users in Kenya who have been incurring huge Internet costs and taking long to get search results due to low quality devices and slower internet speed. WebLite, the new browser, is expected to enable users with low Random-Access Memory (RAM) devices get search results faster. The feature is available for Internet users in Kenya and more than 50 other countries across the world. According the latest Jumia Business Intelligence and GSMA Mobile white paper, Kenya leads Africa in internet penetration at 67 per cent against the continent’s average of 17 per cent, and up to 99 per cent of Kenyans access the internet using their mobile phones. The study found out that most smart phones have low processing speeds, consuming more Internet and delaying results. “The new development is aimed at improving the search experience for millions of people where network connections are slow and access to devices is limited,” said Google Kenya country manager Charles Murito. He said nearly 40 per cent of people in Africa use low RAM android devices that have slow or delayed web connections. WebLite improves the mobile search experience by transcoding mobile search pages into lighter pages that are easier to load. Data by Statista shows Google commands up to 77 per cent of the 1.52 billion search engine users worldwide.
