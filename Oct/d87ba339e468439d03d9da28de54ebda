Governor Mike Sonko can now begin implementing his development projects after he assented to a Bill enabling him to withdraw cash from the countyâ€™s account. The county assembly approved the Appropriations Bill 2017 last Thursday before the governor signed it into law the following day. Sonko had been unable to withdraw cash from the account because previous legislation allowing him to do so had been overturned. The county treasury had published the Appropriations Bill 2017 before MCAs passed the budget estimates.  The move was found to be in violation of the Public Finance Management Act, which guides the budgeting process. â€œUpon approval of the budget estimates by the county assembly, the CEC member for Finance shall prepare and submit a County Appropriations Bill to the assembly for approval of estimates,â€ reads the law. Clerk Jacob Ngwele said he was notified of the anomaly by a voter.  The Bill was published on March 4, 2017, while the budget estimates were approved on March 5.  Former speaker Alex Magelo had ordered that the Bill be republished in accordance with the law, but political campaigns in the run-up to the August 8 election meant MCAs had no time for sessions. The previous assembly instead passed a vote-on-account which allowed the governor to withdraw only up to half of the amount budgeted for during the financial year.  The money could only be used on recurrent expenditure. But the new legislation allows the county government to withdraw cash to finance its Sh35.9 billion 2017/18 budget.  Sonkoâ€™s first action could be withdrawing funds to assist those who lost their property during last weekâ€™s fire at Gikomba market.  â€œWe have a budget under our disaster management unit and we are going to address the issue,â€ Sonko said.
