Madaraka Express passenger service will begin its second trip from November 1, Kenya Railways has announced. The new development will see an afternoon trip introduced on the service with a train leaving both Mombasa and Nairobi at 3:30 pm. “We will have the train stopping at all the intermediate stations which are Athi River, Emali, Kibwezi, Mtito Andei, Voi, Miasenyi and Emali during the morning trip. This is the inter-county train which we had promised in order to ensure that even residents of the counties along the project’s corridor are able to utilize our services,” the corporation’s managing director Atanas Maina said in a statement. With the introduction of a second trip, KR is expected to revise the current train schedule, with the morning inter-county train departing Mombasa and Nairobi stations at 8:00 am and making a stop-over at each of the seven intermediate stations along the Mombasa-Nairobi stretch of the Standard Gauge Railway project. The afternoon train will be an express train with no stoppage at any of the intermediate stations. While at this, the corporation has also been testing its freight services that will commence in 2018. So far, they have partnered with the government to transport relief food from the Port of Mombasa to the inland container depot, and have transported 120,000 tonnes of cereals to-date. The corporation has also announced that the testing phase for commercial cargo is set to commence next month. The Madaraka Express passenger service has been in operation for five months following its commissioning by President Uhuru Kenyatta early this year. To date, the service has transported approximately 330,000 passengers.
