The owner of a hotel in Embu incurred double loss after customers fled without paying when auctioneers invaded the premises and confiscated goods worth Sh1 million over rent arrears. Rose Steve Lodging Bar and Restaurant owner Evans Matheri was yesterday left in disbelief after customers stole beer and nyama choma and left without paying for accommodation. The auctioneers, accompanied by Mugo Holdings Limited director Kaviu Mugo, went to the premises with police and loaded assets into a lorry. Mugo told the press the directors had no choice but to seek legal redress after Matheri refused to pay. The company obtained orders to evict Matheri and sell his property.  The orders were issued by resident magistrate Vincent Nyakundi on September 25.
