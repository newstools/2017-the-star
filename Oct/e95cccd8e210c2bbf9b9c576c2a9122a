Isukha South MCA Faruk Machanje on Saturday recorded a statement at the Kakamega East police station over anti-election chaos in Khayega shopping centre on the Kisumu-Kakamega Road last Thursday. The ward rep was questioned for more than two hours by DCIO Vincent Obae. When he left the station, Machanje dismissed claims that he was the mastermind. He said demos are enshrined in the Constitution. It is not a criminal offence for anyone to be arrested, the MCA said. “I’m being accused of organising demos in Khayega on Thursday. Kenyans have a right to picket,” Machanje said. Kenya is split in the middle , we need prayers to seek God’s intervention to save the country, he said. He urged NASA supporters to stay calm and wait for direction from their leaders Raila Odinga, Kalonzo Musyoka, Musalia Mudavadi and Moses Wetang’ula. By the time of going to press, we had not got a comment from OCPD Benjamin Ongombe, who was in a security meeting at the Kakamega Police Headquarters.  Last Thursday youth engaged police in running battles in Khayega. They barricaded the Kakamega-Kisumu Road. Police lobbed teargas and shot in the air in a bid to disperse the rowdy youth. It took the intervention of Western region police commander Moses Ombati to calm down the youth. Earlier on Tuesday, police had stormed the home of former Kakamega Senator Bony Khalwale in Malinya, Ikolomani, claiming he was organising a gang to disrupt the repeat presidential poll. More than 15 police officers from Kakamega Police Headquarters stormed the home with an intention to search for tyres that were allegedly going to be used to barricade roads on Election Day.
