Residents on the Mai Mahiu-Limuru road yesterday found a bullet-riddled body in the area. This brings to 20 the number of bodies dumped in the area, since January, residents say. Average of two bodies a month. The man’s body had a rope around the neck. The hands and legs were tied. Kijabe police are investigating. The body did not have identification documents. It had five gunshot wounds to the head. Witness Jacob Kiarie said the body was found by herders who informed residents. “The man had been shot from behind. There were also indications his face had been doused in acid,” he said. A police source saying initial investigations indicate the man was killed elsewhere and the body ferried to the scene. The body was taken to Naivasha Subcounty Hospital mortuary. In June, two people were found brutally murdered and their bodies dumped on the Mai Mahiu-Narok road. The bodies of the men were found a few kilometres from Mai Mahiu town by members of the public, who informed police. The victims had head injuries and it is thought they could have been murdered elsewhere and the bodies dumped. Residents said the heads of the victims were crushed with a blunt object.  Some residents said a white car dropped the two bodies at night before driving off towards Mai Mahiu town. Meanwhile, a former worker at the closed Karuturi Flower Farm in Naivasha is suspected to have committed suicide. The mother of four was found yesterday hanging with a rope around her neck in her bedroom. Her friends said she may have committed suicide as she could no longer bear the suffering after she was laid off early last year. A neighbour said the woman sank into depression soon after she was laid off and had been struggling to rear her children. Naivasha subcounty assistant commissioner John Opondo said many of the workers are suffering as they wait for their dues.
