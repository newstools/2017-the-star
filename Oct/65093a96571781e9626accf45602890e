Two security guards were charged in Eldoret on Monday with raping a student at Moi University. Timothy Kemboi and Ezekiel Barmasai denied charges of rape and indecent assault. Chief magistrate Charles Obulutsa released them on Sh500,000 bond each and set the hearing for November 2. The incident is said to have taken place on Friday night as the first year student returned to her hostel. On Sunday, students at the university demanded the suspects' prosecution and threatened to take unspecified action. Their leaders claimed the watchmen told the girl they would report her late return to the administration if she did not comply. Read: Moi University guard arrested for alleged rape of student
