Diamond Platnumzâ€™s record label WCB has recently signed a new artiste, Lava Lava. The kid is now making headlines in Tanzania after being rumoured to be a Ben 10, yaani he is being kept by a Kenyan-based grandma. Lava Lava, who released a song called Tuachane, shut down the rumours, saying his management has catered for his house and no Kenyan cucu is looking after him. â€œHizo habari sijui watu wanatoa wapi na mimi nashindwa kuelewa. Pia zinanifikia kwamba Lava Lava amepangishiwa nyumba na Mkenya, na Mwanamke tajiri,â€ he told Tanzanian press. The Dede hitmaker went ahead to tell the Tanzanian-based site that his management has done all it needs to do to give him a conducive environment. â€œUkweli ni kwamba hizi ni nguvu za management yangu wamenipatia sehemu ya kuishi, mazingira mazuri,â€ Lava Lava said. He went on to insist that he has never dated a Kenyan sugar mummy: â€œLakini sio kweli ya kwamba nimepangiwa na mwanamke tajiri. Mimi sina mahusiano na yeyote. Hamna ukweli wa habari yoyote kuhusiana na mkenya.â€ Lava Lava said he and the Kenyan woman were just doing business and nothing but business. Something that many thought was business mixed with pleasure!
