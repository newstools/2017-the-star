An activist has gone to court to stop the swearing-in of  President Uhuru Kenyatta, a day after NASA chief Raila Odinga withdrew from the presidential rerun. In the suit papers, activist Okiya Omtatah says his case is urgent and should be heard immediately due to current confusion to avoid violation of the Constitution. He has sued IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati, the commission, AG Githu Muigai and Uhuru. The Supreme Court on September 1 nullified Uhuru’s win, citing irregularities and illegalities committed by the IEBC. Uhuru had garnered eight million votes, while Raila has six million votes in the August 8 election. After the nullification, the Supreme Court directed that a fresh election be conducted in 60 days. Raila said the election is pointless without reforms first.  According to Omtatah his case is aimed at defending the Constitution. Yesterday High Court judge John Mativo certified the matter as urgent.  He directed Omtatah to come back for a hearing on October 17.
