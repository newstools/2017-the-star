Fresh protests erupted after Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang'ula addressed NASA supporters on the alleged killing of two people by police. He accused police of using excessive force against anti-election protesters. "We will not be cowed by police brutality. This nonsense should stop or they should come and kill leaders, not our supporters," he said on Friday. He said they have collected enough cartridges that they will use to take action against the police. The NASA co-principal said Thursday's repeat presidential election has shown that Uhuru Kenyatta is very unpopular in the region and only cooked results on August 8. Youths were charged by his address and immediately started lighting bonfires and blocking Mumias road that police cleared earlier. Two people were killed as police shot to disperse protesters in Bungoma town. The first victim was killed at Keringet near the bus park after a rowdy crowd engaged police in running battles. Witness Margaret Wekesa said the man only identified as Barasa was a boda boda ride and that he was shot while running an errand. "He left telling us he was going to the shop. Within a few minutes we saw police chasing after him. We then heard gunshots and saw his lifeless body," she told The Star. The second person was shot at Chebukube market and pronounced dead upon arrival at Khalaba hospital. The demonstrators blocked Mumias road using burning tyres and vehicles and chanted anti-government songs.
