A legislator in Kiambu county has urged NASA leaders to stop criticising last Thursday’s repeat presidential election as they did not participate.  Lari MP Jonah Mburu (pictured) asked the opposition politicians to wait until all regions have voted so they can discuss the issue.  Mburu said NASA leaders, especially from Migori, Kisumu, Homa Bay and Siaya, are bitter because they did not expect many people to turnout to vote for President Uhuru Kenyatta.  “They are angry because Uhuru has received immense support from all regions,” he said.  The MP also urged Kenyans to “only trust reports and figures being released by the IEBC.”  Mburu spoke in Kimende town on Saturday, where he thanked residents for coming out in large numbers to vote on Thursday. He said out of 76,655 registered voters in the constituency, Uhuru received 65,781 votes.  NASA leader Raila Odinga got 57 votes, while Thirdway Alliance’s Ekuru Aukot got 50.  “We gave Uhuru 86 per cent of our votes. We are among the highest in the county,” Mburu said.  According to the results released by the returning officers in Lari, Gatundu North and Githunguri, Uhuru got 86 per cent of votes from each of the three constituencies.  Uhuru garnered 58,387 votes in Gatundu North and 84,989 in Githunguri. Kijabe MCA Nyutu Wamweya urged residents to continue praying for peace.  “We cannot coexist if there is no peace. We should thank God for seeing the country through the repeat presidential election, although there were a lot of challenges,” Wamweya said.
