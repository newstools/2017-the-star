There was little business activity in Kisumu on Friday as most residents kept away from the town. A spot check by the Star found few businesses opened at the main bus terminus, Jubilee Market, Nyamasaria, Nyalenda and parts of the CBD.  There was also a shortage of transport as few PSVs were on the road. Police vehicles patrolled the town. Stones used to barricade roads on Thursday were still on the roads, making movement difficult. On Thursday,  there was a total shutdown of businesses and transport as  residents engaged police in running battles.  Three people were shot dead and more than 20 sustained either gunshot wounds or injuries from police beatings. The IEBC announced it would conduct the election in Kisumu, Migori, Homa Bay and Siaya on Saturday after the exercise failed to take off on Thursday. Trader Michael Otieno said, “We know very well there will be no election in Kisumu and the things witnessed on Thursday are what will be witnessed tomorrow (Friday).”  Another Resident, Samson Oula, said their National Resistance Movement leader Raila Odinga said there will be no election, and that is the county’s stand. “What don’t these people understand? We will not vote, period. We are waiting for them tomorrow. We will not be intimidated by police officers,” he said, adding some locals will be headed to church. Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o said there are 99 victims of police brutality, mostly in Obunga, Manyatta, Kondele and Nyawita. “A total of 26 out of the 99 victims have gunshot wounds,” the county boss said when he condemned the acts.
