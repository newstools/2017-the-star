It is a good thing that the repeat presidential stakeholders are finally meeting â€“ albeit separately â€“ with the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission. Yesterday IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati and deputy chairman Consolata Nkatha met NASA leader Raila Odinga on his own, unaccompanied by the alliance co-principals. The IEBC should meet both sides, address their concerns, insist that they step down from their campaign rhetoric and participate in an election that meets the challenge of the Supreme Court annulment of September 1. All people of goodwill in Kenya and among our observers are looking forward to an amicable solution. The Supreme Courtâ€™s ruling about a rerun within 60 days should be obeyed across the political divide. The 60 days elapse on November 1. A delay could have dire consequences, the worst of which are not even clear now. A broad agreement between the competing parties ahead of October 26 would be in the overriding national interest and smack of statesmanship, not reckless brinkmanship. Kenyansâ€™ irreducible minimum is a free, fair and lawful repeat election.
