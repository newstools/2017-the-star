The government has launched an immunisation campaign targetting 300,000 children below the age of five who might have missed out on six essential vaccines because of the nurses’ strike. It will cover polio, tetanus, measles, BCG, influenza and pneumonia vaccines. The two-month Catch Up drive also targets pregnant mothers in dire need of antenatal and postnatal care. It will be in 11 counties that have been worst-hit by the strike. These are Turkana, Lamu, Marsabit, Isiolo, Wajir, Mandera, Garissa, Tana River, Samburu, West Pokot and Baringo. If the campaign proves successful, it will be rolled out in the rest of the counties. Community health volunteers and workers will be absorbed to help identify children. “In these regions, there are cohorts of children who are susceptible to infections which can result in an outbreak. If there is an outbreak, they are likely to be wiped out,” Health CS Cleopa Mailu said yesterday. Nurses went on strike on June 5 to demand better pay and working conditions. Since then, Kenya’s health indicators have dropped from 90 per cent to 40. “This campaign is very necessary, given what the health sector has experienced during these strikes. Some of the signs we are seeing across the country, such as the malaria outbreaks, upsurge of cholera cases and the threatening possibility of a measles outbreak, can be attributed to it,” Mailu said. The campaign is a partnership between the Health ministry, Unicef, Amref and the Kenya Red Cross. It will involve scaling up immunisation, nutrition screening and care, adult and outpatient services and the continuity of TB and ARV drugs among HIV-positive persons and TB patients. WHO representative Rudi Eggers said lack of primary healthcare should not be allowed to continue without a plan to prevent suffering. She urged Kenya to have a strong resilience system and quality affordable healthcare.
