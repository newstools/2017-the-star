Two Siaya county leaders have laughed off plans by the IEBC to declare Uhuru Kenyatta the President-elect. Gem MP Elisha Odhiambo (pictured) told the Star it will be awkward for chairman Wafula Chebukati to declare anyone President-elect based on the October 26 election result. Odhiambo said the Constitution states a national election must be conducted in all the 290 constituencies, not the PR exercise Chebukati presided over. Odhiambo asked Chebukati to call for a reconciliation meeting between all parties and conduct a free and fair election after 90 days. Alego Usonga MP Samuel Atandi said “Its now clear that Deputy President William Ruto is the national returning officer, especially after declaring results even before the IEBC officials.” On Friday Ruto told CNN the total votes cast were 7.5 million, when the IEBC portal showed 4.3 million.
