The outspoken singer announced over the weekend that she and her mzungu bae are excited to be finally expecting a bundle of joy. Nyota Ndogo has never shied away from letting the world know how much she adores her mzungu husband and all the things he does for her that make her a happy wifey. The Watu na Viatu singer's announcement has, however, not pleased some of her fans, who felt she should have kept such personal information to herself. She posted a video of her husband running around the kitchen attempting to make her a meal. She explained the video by saying, 'Pale unapomwambia mume nina mimba then anakwambia don't touch anything, I will do it for you'. Her followers commented: rosebe24: Hii ni Instagram account yako nyota so you can post whatever you like! Be careful na wale wanasema eti ungepost vitu kama hizi na mambo mengi sana hao ndiyo madui .
