In recent weeks, parks of Kenya have been very hot, dry and dusty, including the Nairobi National Park. The start of the seasonal short rains have been a most welcome blessing from above, as the rain brings new life to so many species. It appears that many prayers have been answered, for we should never take the precious water supply for granted. It should be noted that other parts of East Africa, like Ethiopia and Somalia, and parts of Kenya, are still experiencing very serious drought. Even though driving in some parts of the park is not advised during the wet season, especially if trying to drive without a 4X4 vehicle, some main roads are still in good driving condition and well worth the effort of visiting the park. It is always amazing to look at the variation of wildlife that can still be seen, with many of the species behaving differently due to the rains.  Some seemed to be celebrating by running around in the mud, or splashing in the water. Antelope species start giving birth, and predators need to adopt different tactics other than waiting at water holes to catch their prey. Others like some birds appeared to be hard at work with nest building. There are also many beautiful plants flowering now, and interesting insects are in abundance.  In the Nairobi National Park, there is always something interesting and fascinating to see. Historically, the seasonal rains also result in many species moving south and out of the park boundaries, including predators such as lions, as they follow the herds. We pray for their eventual return into the park. The park is currently starting to transform from a dry, dusty place into a thriving paradise.
