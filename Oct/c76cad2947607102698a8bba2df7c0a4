A tractor driver on Thursday evening was swept away by raging water in the rain-swollen River Athi. Joshua Mungai, 43, drowned after the tractor he was driving was swept away while he was attempting to cross the river at Stage 39 Bridge in Athi River town. He was trying to avoid a traffic jam on Mombasa Road. Antony Kiio reported the incident at Athi River police station. Kiio said he was from travelling from Kanaani Slum to Nairobi on board the tractor when the incident occurred. He said when they reached River Athi’s Stage 39 Bridge, the driver decided to cross the river at the new bridge. Kiio said he pleaded with the driver to follow the jam on the main road, but he refused. He said he requested the driver to allow him to alight, since he feared the raging waters after it rained.  “The passenger alighted and the driver drove into the river. When the tractor was swept away, the driver tried to swim out, but did not make it to the banks,” the statement reads.  Athi River police boss Sharma Wario said efforts to retrieve the body from the river have been hampered by the raging river.
