Countries are broke and most services have been crippled due to lack of funds, West Pokot Governor John Lonyangapuo has said Lonyangapuo asked Treasury to release funds immediately so they pay workers' salaries and take care of services. "National and county governments are two different entities. We should not paralyse the functions of one because of the election," he said, noting politics should not hinder service delivery. On Tuesday, governors said they were considering legal action against President Uhuru Kenyatta's administration for starving counties of operation funds. The last time counties received money from the Treasury was July when the 2017/18 financial year started.

"Auditors have revealed many officers looted county property. My government will not condone this; those implicated will be arrested and prosecuted." He spoke during a meeting with 3,000 West Pokot workers on Wednesday. On NASA's demonstrations against election laws and the IEBC, Lonyangapuo said they should stop and focus on campaigns. "They should halt the demonstrations since they are affecting our economy. The coalition needs to trasverse the country and ask for votes from Kenyans," he said. "The Opposition has played a vital role in keeping the government on its toes to ensure Kenyans get services." On security, the Governor said they are in the process of flushing out bandits hiding at the border of Pokot south and Marakwet east.
