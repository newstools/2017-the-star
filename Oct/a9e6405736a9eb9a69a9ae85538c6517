The government is aware of the hunger situation in the country, Irrigation PS Zainab Hussein has said. Speaking during the launch of a food distribution programme at Dida Primary School in Kilifi county on Sunday, she said the government has identified 17 counties where food aid is urgently needed. She said the programme will first be implemented in learning institutions to ensure students stay in schools as they prepare for national examinations. “The government is deeply concerned by the current situation and that is why I brought these foodstuffs,” Zainab said. “We want to make sure children do not miss school because of hunger,” she added.  She was accompanied by nominated Senator Christine Zawadi and officers from the Child Welfare Society of Kenya.  CWSK officer in charge of emergency response Esther Kihara said 978 bags of maize and 200 bags of beans will be distributed in the next three days. “Each student in the 41 schools will get maize and beans to take home. We will also give them some clothes and a bar soap each,” Kihara said.
