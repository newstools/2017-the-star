A group of Jubilee poll losers have called on President Uhuru Kenyatta and NASA leader Raila Odinga to engage in dialogue on election reforms ahead of October 26 fresh presidential poll. The leaders who lost their seats during the August 8 General Election said the duo should unite and cool down the political temperature in the country and compete fairly. The leaders – William Kabogo, Samuel Ragwa, Peter Mositet, Martha Karua, Kilemi Mwiria, Ndung’u Gethenji and Kabando wa Kabando – said the electoral agency was ‘dithering’ and called for honest engagements on the presedential election process. Speaking to the media at a Nairobi hotel yesterday, the caucus led by Kabando said there is need to cease the prevailing political tension, warning that it could negatively affect the poll. “A direct engagement between our President Uhuru Kenyatta and his main rival Raila Odinga, competition isn’t enmity - our leaders should compete but remain friends for we are all of same mother, Kenya,” Kabando said. “We call for honest re-engagement with the IEBC on the presidential election process. Stop any form of violence and punishment of all perpetrators.” Kabando said the country should maintain its resilience and optimism, urging Raila and Uhuru to promote dialogue so as to improve the current situation. “The escalating legislative, judicial and public protests surrounding IEBC’s handling of the fresh presidential election calls for bold, nonpartisan interventions to not only calm the deteriorating situation, but also rescue our nation from disintegrating,” he said. The leaders said that the world is keenly observing the current political tensions rising in the country, warning it is creating an atmosphere of fear.
