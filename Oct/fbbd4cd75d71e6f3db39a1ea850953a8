Suspected militants have attacked an Indian army camp in Srinagar in Indian-administered Kashmir, officials said. Three Border Security Force (BSF) personnel were injured in the attack, which began at 04:00 local time (22:30 GMT Monday). Authorities say security forces continue to exchange gunfire with the attackers. The camp is located just outside the international airport in Srinagar - a heavily fortified area. Airport officials told the BBC that flight operations are on hold and no employees, passengers or vehicles are being allowed to go towards the airport. The attackers are still on the camp's premises, holed up in a building, according to BSF officials. Police have called it a suicide attack and also say that one body, suspected to be that of one of the attackers, has been found so far, the Press Trust of India reported.
