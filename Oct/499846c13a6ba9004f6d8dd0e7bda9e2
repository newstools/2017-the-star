Laikipia Governor Ndiritu Muriithi (pictured) and Deputy Governor John Mwaniki have decried the rising political tension in the country, saying it is hurting the economy. Addressing the media in Nanyuki town yesterday, the two urged the national political players to end the stalemate for the country to move forward. They said NASA is making unnecessary demands. â€œAs an economist, the prolonged political campaigning and wrangles are bad for the economy,â€ Muriithi said. He added that according to the monthly statistics from the Kenya Bureau of Statistics, there was decline in new credit updates, international arrivals and occupancy in hotels.  Mwaniki said the tourism sector in the county has been badly affected.
