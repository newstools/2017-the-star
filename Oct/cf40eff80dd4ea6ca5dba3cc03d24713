Cash strapped Nakumatt Holding is set to close its Junction Mall branch, this after it was closed to public yesterday. According to a notice patched on the retailer's door, it has relinquished its rights over the premises pursuant to a surrender dated September 15 this year. ''The premises will be closed to the public from October 1 and no trading will be permitted at the premises. Nakuamtt's directors and authorised agents and employees will however be permitted access fro the purpose of removing stock and other property,'' read the notice. The closure of The Junction mall branch is barely two weeks after the retailer suspended activities at the Thika Road Mall and a month after closing the Nextgen Mall branch along Mombasa Road. Although the management did not give reasons for closure, speculation is rife that the retailer can no longer afford tenancy at the mall. Efforts to reach Nakumatt's managing director Atul Shah for comment were not successful. Nakumatt's woes seem far from over even after details of its merger with Tuskys leaked to the public two weeks ago. The two retailers are said to have signed a deal that could see Nakuamtt access stock from suppliers using Tuskys supermarketsâ€™ goodwill and value chain. Even so, Yusuf Mugweru, one of the directors at Tuskys supermarket is said to have rejected the deal on Wednesday last week. Nakumatt is struggling to pay massive debts owed to suppliers estimated at Sh15 billion, a situation that has been piling pressure on its operations.
