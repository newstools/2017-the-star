A voter on Friday moved to the Court of Appeal to reverse a High Court decision allowing inclusion of all presidential contenders in the October 26 rerun . He says the rerun is cancelled since NASA leader Raila Odinga withdrew. Abraham Mutai in his memorandum of appeal said Justice John Mativo erred in law when he held that Dr Ekuru Aukot was an eligible candidate. Through lawyer Nelson Havi, Mutai said the judge erred in departing from the decision of the Supreme Court that defined a fresh election.  The lawyer said the upcoming poll is deemed cancelled following the withdrawal from the race of NASA leader Raila Odinga on Tuesday.  On Wednesday, Mativo in a landmark judgment, allowed the Thirdway Alliance presidential candidate’s name to be included on the ballot.  He said the electoral agency was wrong to lock him out, violating his rights and those of his constituents. The judge also said everyone who participated in the nulified election qualify to run again. It was in the public interest for everyone to contest again, he said. Raila initially supported the eligibility petition by Aukot on grounds it was discriminatory to lock him out. In his appeal, Mutai says Mativo disregarded decisions by the Supreme Court on the effect of “obiter dictum” and that he erred in relying solely upon decisions from other jurisdiction in arriving at his decision. “The learned judge of the High Court erred in law, in holding that the second respondent’s (IEBC) exclusion of the first respondent (Aukot) from participation in the ordered fresh election was discriminatory and unconstitutional,” he says. He says the court committted another error when it held the Supreme Court’s interpretation of the meaning of “fresh election” under Article 140 ( 3 ) of The Constitution was not binding upon it and was a mere “ad hoc observation”.
