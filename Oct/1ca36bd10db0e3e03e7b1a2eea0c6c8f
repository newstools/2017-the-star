The electoral agency has permitted access to the results transmission server for the October 26 repeat presidential election. The rights were given, from to presidential candidates, agents and observers who made requests to the IEBC. "IEBC is in process of making arrangements to avail the logs to others upon request," the commission said via Twitter on Tuesday. Accessing the servers is a sign IEBC does not want to be accused of overseeing a flawed process. There have been claims by the opposition that the KIEMS kits only identified 3.4 million voters by the end of the voting on October 26 On election day, agents and observers were able to view the activity of KIEMS kits to see how many people had been identified after every 90 mins. At 2pm on October 26, the KIEMS kits had sent identification data of 4.69 million voters (31.4 per cent) while at 4pm, the figure stood at 5.23 million (34.4 per cent).   IEBC announced Uhuru Kenyatta winner with 7,483,895 million votes after a voter turnout of 38.84 per cent. The number was equivalent to 98 per cent of all the votes cast. But Opposition leaders led by Raila Odinga have insisted the numbers were topped up and that the turnout was much lower than reported. The NASA leader is expected to give his announcement on the way forward today.
