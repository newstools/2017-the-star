Kisumu Senator Fred Outa is being investigated inn connection with disruption of poll officials’ training on Wednesday. The training was to take place at the Kisumu Huduma Centre, but youths destroyed the venue before the meeting could start. Tents were pulled down. A woman who was contracted to put up the tents was roughed up. She was rescued by police officers. Nyanza regional coordinator Wilson Njega said Outa is among leaders being investigated over the incident. He said Outa led the youths who disrupted the meeting. “Nobody is above the law,” he said. He said the government will not allow anybody to disrupt the training. Njega said 10 people have been arrested over the disruption. He said nobody will be allowed to gain entry into the IEBC training venues unless they have been invited.
