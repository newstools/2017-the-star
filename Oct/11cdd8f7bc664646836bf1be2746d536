Most Busia residents stayed away from the repeat presidential election yesterday.  NASA called for a boycott but no violence or disruptions were reported. Polling stations in Budalang’i and Funyula constituencies opened as early as 6am, but remained empty for the better part of the day. St Jude’s Nambale RC Primary School polling station in Funyula, Samia subcounty, opened at 6.10am. But by 8.30a only six voters — one per cent — had cast their votes.  At Munani ECD polling station, voting was delayed 15 minutes when Kiems kits malfunctioned.  Many residents said they had decided not to vote after sensing the election will not be free, fair and credible. They said the IEBC had refused to allow necessary reforms. “I see no point of participating.  “Despite IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati agreeing earlier the poll could not be free and fair without reforms, he has allowed it to go on,” a trader said.  Some voters said the rerun is a smokescreen with a predetermined outcome.
