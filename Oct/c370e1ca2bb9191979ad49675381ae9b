A Moi University security guard has been arrested for alleged sexual assault on a female student in a hostel. The suspect is being held at the Kesses police station. This followed a complaint by the student. She recorded a statement at the station and with the university security officials. Dean of Students J.S Ayieko said the incident allegedly took place at 2am on Friday in Hostel J. Investigations are ongoing. He did not explain how the guard entered the hostel, which houses many students. â€œThe university administration and the studentsâ€™ leadership are committed to ensuring justice to the victim and preventing similar cases,â€ Ayieko said. He appealed to students, who have gone through similar experiences, to report so investigations are carried out. Sources said students threatened to take unspecified action if culprits are not punished. Two months ago, vice chancellor Laban Ayiro launched floodlights to improve security.
