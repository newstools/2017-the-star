President Uhuru Kenyatta has sent DP William Ruto to his IEBC meeting despite direction that candidates appear in person. Last week, IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati said the presidential hopefuls would attend meetings in person instead of sending "sideshow" representatives. Ruto arrived at Bomas of Kenya in Nairobi at 4:15pm on Tuesday with Senate majority leader Kipchumba Murkomen (Elgeyo Marakwet) and Aden Duale (Garissa Town) of the National Assembly. They reached the venue shortly after NASA leaders led by Raila Odinga completed their meeting. Raila attended the meeting with his running mate Kalonzo Musyoka, Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang'ula (Ford Kenya), Musalia Mudavadi (ANC) and Siaya's James Orengo. Orengo said their meeting was not fruitful but that they were will be another one later today. The Senator said IEBC is giving them the report of what they are doing, not what they intend to do to rectify mistakes made in the August 8 election. "There should be an audit to ensure security and integrity of the technology to be deployed. IEBC is not clear on this," he said.
