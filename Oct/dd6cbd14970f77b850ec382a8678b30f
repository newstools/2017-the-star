The opposition will campaign and go on to win the presidential election rerun, despite its twice a week anti-IEBC protests, Uriri MP Mark Nyamita has said. NASA has organised weekly demos across the country every Monday and Friday, and several press conferences against the IEBC. â€œWe have received criticism from our opponents that instead of campaigning we have planned demonstrations across the country. We want to assure them that our campaigns are on course,â€ Nyamita said. He spoke in Migori town on Monday when he led demonstrators to carry a mock â€˜coffinâ€™ with â€˜remainsâ€™ of Chiloba that was set on fire.
