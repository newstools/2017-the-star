Nandi Governor Stephen Sang has ordered the blacklisting of rogue contractors who do shoddy work and delay projects. The county is assessing all projects over the last five years. Contractors who have not completed projects or who have done substandard work will not be paid and will not be hired again. â€œWe will withhold their payment because the county cannot afford to waste public resources on poorly done work. We need value for money,â€ Sang told the Star on Wednesday. Contractors are among suppliers and others who are demanding more than Sh500 million from the county for work over five years. Sang wants all contracts and debts to be assessed before payment. A major financial and staff audit is underway after Auditor General Edward Ouko sent his team to investigate, at the governor's request. At least 1,060 employees, most of them casuals, were suspended to pave way for the audit.
