Many people know Patricia Kihoro as an actor and songstress, but you will be surprised to learn that she didn't study either, and dabbled in odd jobs before she became famous. During an event called Women, Words and Wine, Patricia said she studied psychology and did other side hustles. "When I was choosing what to study in the university, I never wanted to be a clinical psychologist. I loved the course but knew I was going to sing and act." Patricia added that her dream campus was USIU. "As much as I assumed I will end up in the USIU, my parents could not afford the place and so I went to Moi University in Eldoret. It was a great experience and I ended up enjoying the place. "I studied psychology because I didn't know what course to choose.  "So I felt like a study of humans is something that will get me through anything. If I know what motivates human beings to do things that they want to do, then I will be fine." Patricia has also done a few side hustles just to get that extra mulla. "I had spent some time doing advertising as I was also interested in it. I worked in Kenchic, washed clothes and worked as a psychologist and a photographer. I also studied graphics design. Anything that I was interested in, I tried," she concluded.
