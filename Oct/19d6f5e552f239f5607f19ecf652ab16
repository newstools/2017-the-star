The question is increasingly being asked whether the National Police Service has rubber bullets. Unarmed protesters the world over fight, even in the major democracies. In Kenya, the police carry assault rifles, even when they use teargas. An AK-47 is designed to kill targets even a kilometre away and they go through walls at close range. Using assault rifles against unarmed protesters is wrong. AK-47s are military calibre weapons. Even firing in the air is unsafe with rifles. The case of the two-and-a-half-year-old girl in Kisumu who had a bullet removed from her shoulder is one of the best arguments against the use of live rounds. She was at home and far from protest action. What stops the police from ordering 100,000 rubber bullets from Dubai or China? Uganda police are ruthless when it comes to anti-riot action, but no deaths are reported. The cops must change their policing of unarmed protestors by discontinuing the use of live rounds and martial weapons at once.
