Ukoo Flani's talented rapper BlackGzas Dadi talked to Word Is about the elections and explained why he chose his stage name. Kenya went to the polls in a repeat presidential election yesterday, in an event marred by violent protests and low voter turnouts in Nasa strongholds. This is after Nasa flagbearer Raila Odinga called for a boycott. Dadi said he would travel to Tanzania during the election period. "I have been to Tanzania for a
long period," he said. "It is a very peaceful place and I'm thinking of going back
there again. Because right now the election stories are giving me
tension.  "I have a voter's card but I have never voted because I have
learned that even if you vote, there are always claims that the
elections was rigged. I still don't have the right person to vote for. I
don't want anyone following me on this. This is my personal opinion.
There is no need of voting for someone then after two years, I start to
complain." On why he chose the stage name, he said: "The reason why I call myself BlackGzas is because people are waiting for Jesus to come down and help us, while Jesus said we can be like him if we want to. Then, as for black, we are black, and that is the message behind that name."Â  He concluded by saying, "I urge people to continue to support the truth. Let us all be real to ourselves."
