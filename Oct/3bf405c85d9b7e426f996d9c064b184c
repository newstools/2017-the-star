Kenya Re will this year set aside one per cent of its profits to fund the ‘’Niko Fiti’’ campaign to help people living with disability. Speaking yesterday at the Kerugoya Level 4 Hospital, corporate affairs manager Gladys Mwangi said since the programme was launched in 2011, 4,000 people living with disability have benefitted. She spoke after handing over wheelchairs. Mwangi urged parents and relatives of people living with disability not to hide their children out of shame. She urged them to register the children with the Association for the Physically Disabled of Kenya for access to support. The Niko Fiti campaign aims to donate mobility and assistive devices to 746 people in Kirinyaga, Meru and Embu counties. Mwangi raised concerns about the state of many schools, which do not meet the needs of the disabled. Kenya Re said it will build ramps in Lenana School and Moi Girls’ Isinya. The two are national schools. Mwangi also urged the society to campaign against segregation of people living with disability but instead motivate and empower them.
