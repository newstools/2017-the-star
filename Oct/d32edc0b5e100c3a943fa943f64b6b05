The Kerio Valley residents have asked the Elgeyo Marakwet government to stop opposing the establishment of Sh30 billion Arror dam. They on Tuesday said the multipurpose dam will supply water for irrigation and domestic uses to the drier parts of the Kerio Valley belt. Led by Kerio Youths Association chairman Joel Kimaiyo, they accused Governor Alex Tolgos of politicising the life-changing project.  â€œOur governor should stop interfering with plans by the Kerio Valley Development Authority in collaboration with the Italian government to establish power and irrigation projects on the valley,â€ Kimaiyo said. The youths said the project will tackle perennial famine and cattle rustling that have retarded development in the area for decades.
