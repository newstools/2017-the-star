Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua has threatened to sack nurses in the county for participating in an illegal industrial action. He asked the lot to return to work by Tuesday if they want to retain their jobs, adding that the courts had declared the strike illegal. "I am pleading with the nurses to resume duty immediately to save lives of suffering residents," Mutua told journalists on Monday. He said at his office in Machakos town that the over 1,000 nurses, among others across the country, had defied governors' plea for them resume their duties. "Governors have pleaded with them to return to work but they have refused as our people continue to suffer," the county boss said. He urged the health workers to return to their workstations as the talks continue adding that those who heed the call will not be served dismissal letters. Mutua asked nurses seeking employment to apply for jobs in Machakos. Â
