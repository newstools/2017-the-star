Some 300 elderly people celebrated the International Day of Older Persons on Tuesday. The event was organised by Purity Care Elderly Foundation founder Joyce Kairu. Kairu recently received a global award from Switzerland for her passion for taking care of the elderly. She received a special commendation from the Global Ageing Network. The award will be presented to her next month during the 2017 Global Ageing Conference in Switzerland. â€œI am humbled by the recognition. It was the first special award in Africa of a kind. However, I must say that this [award] is not for me, but for us all,â€ Kairu said. The senior citizens danced and shared a meal at Dedan Kimathi Kamukunji Stadium, Nyeri town. They also went home with gift hampers. The International Day of Older Persons is observed annually on October 1, which this year fell on a Sunday. The Nyeri celebrations were postponed to Tuesday so the elderly people could attend church. â€œKenyans need to ensure that the aged persons are not neglected or left lonely since they have many challenges, including medical care and housing,â€ Kairu said. She said she is looking for funds to build a home for the elderly. The event was attended by Nyeri Deputy Governor Mutahi Kahiga who praised Kairu for caring for the aged for more than five years.
