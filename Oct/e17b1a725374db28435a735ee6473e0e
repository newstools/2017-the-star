Two suspects found with "stolen" chicken are helping police with investigations after being arrested on Saturday. Bernard Ngeno and Stephen Rono were found with chicken which they were ferrying to the market. Keogo assistant chief Joseph Chelogoi said the two were handed over to police in Kapkugerwet. Chelogoi said the suspects have been stealing chicken from various homesteads in Keogo before selling them for as little Sh200 each to residents of Kericho. He said they will be arraigned in court after investigations are complete.  Kericho East subcounty commissioner Stanislaus Apwoka confirmed the incident. He appealed to Kericho residents not to buy stolen chicken.  “Before buying anything from anyone, establish first if the seller in the genuine owner,” Apwoka said.
