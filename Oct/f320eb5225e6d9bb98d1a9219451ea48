Tana River Governor Dhadho Godhana has differed with a section of election leaders on the October 26 repeat election. The ODM Governor said residents should not take part in the election, while Senator Juma Wario (Jubilee) and woman rep Rehema Hassan (Maendeleo Chap Chap) said residents should vote on Thursday. Dhadho said the country is not ready for a credible and fair election and this should be resolved before going to the ballot. "I don't see elections being held," he said during Mashujaa Day celebrations on Friday. He defended his opinion saying they are not meant to please anyone, adding that the election should be postponed to next year so it is conducted the right way. But Hassan asked residents to turn out in large numbers to vote on Thursday. "Do not be cheated to remain at home ... go and vote peacefully and return to your homes," she said.
