A photo of former Harambee Stars coach Jacob â€˜Ghostâ€™ Mulee and his former player and captain, Dennis Oliech, created a storm online moments after Mulee posted it. Kenyans from all walks of life bombarded the now viral post with comments, some claiming that the legendary national team forward is wallowing in poverty thanks to his latest rugged look. The comments did not augur well with Mulee, who has now come out in his former playerâ€™s defence. Word Is caught up with Ghost Mulee, the Liberty Academy technical director. â€œMost of those comments are heartbreaking,â€ he said. â€œFor those who know Dennis, he is a very responsible guy. He has served as Harambee Stars captain and done a lot for this country, and I donâ€™t know why his new look has caused all these reactions, some claiming that he is broke. Do guys really know his pockets? â€œDennis has always supported his mum when she was battling cancer for two years. Those are the traits of a very responsible person. We met and talked, that is his new look. I am just surprised by peopleâ€™s reactions on social media. Sometimes before you say a word about someone, think about yourself. Tuwacheni umama.â€
