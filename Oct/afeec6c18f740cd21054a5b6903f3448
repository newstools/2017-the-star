The political impasse is happening during the national examinations season in the school system, from Standard 8 to Form 4. The stresses on pupils sitting their Kenya Certificate of Primary Education exams and students sitting the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education exams have never been more pressing. Day scholars who commute from home to school and back are particularly stressed by all those images in the media and in real-time of burning shopping centres, looted homes and the deaths from mostly live bullets fired at unarmed protesters by the police. Counselling would come in useful just now for the exam candidates, but counselors are few and far between. Many of the candidates were very young at the height of the post-election violence crisis a decade ago. They have grown up in the shadow of PEV. This is a generation that will be traumatized by fear of political violence. The political class should give the kids a conducive atmosphere to do their exams.
