The US government yesterday called for speedy investigations into allegations that police officers used excessive force when quelling anti-poll protests last week. Supporters of NASA staged anti-IEBC protests on Thursday and Friday in Nairobi, Bungoma and in Nyanza region. They were protesting against a decision by the commission to conduct Thursday’s repeat presidential election. US Ambassador Robert Godec in a statement to the media condemned use of excessive force. He urged security apparatus to uphold constitutionalism. Godec urged Kenyans to be calm and peaceful after the release of the repeat presidential election results. The repeat presidential election results were announced yesterday and President Uhuru Kenyatta was declared winner. “We are deeply concerned by reports of excessive use of force by police. We urge that all such allegations be fully investigated and any officers who have acted outside the law be held to account. Protesters, who are exercising their constitutional rights have an obligation to do so peacefully,” he said. “The security services have a special responsibility to show maximum restraint in the use of force and should use it only when there is no other choice to protect life and property.” Godec said there is need for urgent national dialogue to end ethnic divisions that have been witnessed in the country before, during and after the repeat presidential election. He urged Kenyans to reject politics of hatred and division along ethic lines. “We again urge there be an immediate, sustained, open and transparent national dialogue involving all Kenyans to resolve the deep divisions that the electoral process has exacerbated,” Godec said. Jubilee and NASA leaders have rejected calls for dialogue.
