At least 10 people have died of malaria and 400 have been hospitalisted in Baringo and West Pokot counties. The worst outbreak is in in Akoret in Tiaty subcounty, Baringo. Children are among those sickened. Nakorpatagh Kalmoi and her seriously sick child were referred to Chester Hospital, West Pokot county, on Sunday. Her child developed fever, vomiting and diarrhea on Thursday. More than 400 patients were admitted in various hospitals in the two counties, Tirioko ward administrator Peter Kiptalam said. Kiptalam confirmed 10 people, including children, have died since last week.  Out of the 14 patients tested at Koloa dispensary on Monday, 12 tested positive for malaria, he said. Tiaty subcounty public health officer Geoffrey Nakopir and the medical staff from the Kenya Red Cross have camped in the area since Sunday.  Nakopir did not confirm any deaths, although Red Cross admitted the gravity of the malaria outbreak in Akoret. â€œIt is true the disease has seen several patients admitted in hospitals but we are yet to receive the records of any deaths,â€ Red Cross North Rift Coordinator Michael Ayabei told the Star on the phone yesterday.  East Pokot deputy commissioner Yusuf Huka said the outbreak is under control, dismissing reports three people have succumbed.  Area MCA Sam Louren said, â€œMany people are illiterate donâ€™t know about mosquito nets. Most are pastoralists, herding their livestock in the bushes far away from roads and homestead.â€  Louren said the larger Akoret division lacks any health facility, forcing people to travel many kilometers to access medical services.  He blamed this on poor leadership.
