Police in Kikuyu subcounty are searching for a gang that has been raiding houses and stealing goods. Senior assistant county commissioner Damaris Kimondo yesterday said the gang raids houses then flees to other subcounties. The gang is said to have rented houses in Limuru and Naivasha. Kimondo said day and night patrols have been intensified and community policing and Nyumba Kumi members have been alerted to report unusual activity. Gothoto, Gikambura, Karai, Nderi and Gitaru have been the worst hit. On Saturday, police were tipped off about stolen goods being hidden in a house in Limuru. Laptops, clocks, carpets, wine, radios, TVs, woofers, gas cylinders, shoes, torches, master keys and cash were confisicated. â€œWe will not stop. We are following close leads that will help us arrest the whole gang. We believe they are many of them living in different areas,â€ Kimondo said.  She continued, â€œThey waylay people and break into their houses either at night or during the day, when occupants are not at home.â€
