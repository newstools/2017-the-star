The Kenya Ports Authority will embark on the construction of a modern container terminal in January 2018. The work, to be financed with a Sh35.19 billion (USD339.2 million) loan from Japan, will spearhead the second phase of the broader Mombasa port upgrade, according to shipping news website Hellenic Shipping News. Total cost of the Mombasa Port upgrade and modernization programme is expected to cost Sh93.37 billion ($900 million) and will transform the coastal city into a modern facility serving the larger East African hinterland. The process of tendering for this job, that will oversee construction of Berth 22, is underway and groundbreaking for the project will be done in January, according to KPA managing director Catherine Wairi. When the whole project involving phase one, two and three is complete, it will create an additional capacity of 450,000 twenty foot equivalent units (TEU) or more depending on the cargo dwell times. According to KPA, the process will involve reclamation of the sea to create a terminal with three berths measuring 15 metres, 12 metres and 11 metres deep. Phase 2 will involve construction of Berth 22, which will be 320 meters long and 15 metres deep. Phase 3 will involve the development of Berth 23, which will be 230 metres in length, 12 meters deep and a side berth of 4.5 meters deep and 80 metres long. There will also be construction of additional stacking yards, procurement of equipment and dredging works. The construction period for these two phases is expected to be complete in 2023. In total, once all the phases are completed, the terminal will have a total capacity of 1.5-million twenty-foot-equivalent units a year. Â
