The Kenya University Staff Union has asked the government to fully implement the 2013-2017 Collective Bargain Agreement or face a strike. KUSU Secretary-General Charles Mukhwaya said the government has been reluctant to implement the CBA despite their demands. "We would not like to see the learning calendar disturbed in the universities. It's becoming difficult for union leadership to continue restraining its members from demanding for their rights which have been deliberately trampled on," he said. Mukhwaya spoke in Nakuru on Saturday during a National Governing Council of KUSU. "The CBA was successfully negotiated, concluded and signed on May 9, 2017, and was to be implemented before June 30, 2017, however, to date, not even a single member has been paid," he said. The council secretary revealed that it was forced to take to the streets on July 2017 and through their pressure, the government released Sh10 billion which was used to settle arrears and not salary and house allowances. The government according to the council has had a lot of grace period but has done nothing.  Mukhwaya said they are surprised by the governmentâ€™s failure to honour their agreement which was even registered at the Employment and Labour Relations Court.
