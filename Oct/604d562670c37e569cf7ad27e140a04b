Hospitals in the North Rift have been hard-hit by the nursesâ€™ strike. Patients are forced seek costly treatment in private hospitals. Despite sack threats from governors, the nursesâ€™ union has refused to call off the four-month-long boycott. The Moi Referral and Teaching Hospital has more cases of patients with minor ailments. â€œThe strike has severely affected sevices. We are considering hiring new health workers,â€ Elgeyo Marakwet Governor Alex Tolgos said.  He had given nurses up to last Friday to resume work or lose their jobs. But Benson Biwott, the Elgeyo Marakwet KNUN secretary, told nurses to ignore the threats. Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago urged the nurses to resume work. A spot check in Uasin Gishu, Elgeyo Marakwet and Kitale showed few nurses were at work.
