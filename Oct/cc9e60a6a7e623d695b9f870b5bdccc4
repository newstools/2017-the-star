Several livestock markets have been shut down following an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in parts of Uasin Gishu County. MCAs led by Julius Songok of Tulwet said Kesses Sub County was one of the worst affected. Songok said many farmers have already lost their animals to the disease. He wants the government to move faster and release funds to control the spread of the disease. â€œThe problem we have now is that there is no funding to enable livestock officers to buy the required vaccinations to help in controlling the disease that is killing the animals at a very fast rate,â€ said Songok. Uasin Gishu County executive for Agriculture Cyril Cheruiyot said they had deployed livestock officers to help tackle the disease in the region. He said the closure of markets and a ban on the movement of livestock in some areas would help to control the spread the disease that has killed an estimated 300 animals in the region. In West Pokot Governor John Lonyangapuo has commissioned a free livestock vaccination exercise against the contagious Borine Pleura Pneumonia (CBP) disease in parts of the county.  He launched the exercise at at Kanyerus in Suam Ward of Kacheliba Constituency. The week long exercise will be conducted in North Pokot along its borders with Uganda and Turkana County. â€œIt is a preventive measure and targets 30,000 heads of livestock. I urge the national government to boost the exercise through additional funding so that we reach all animals in targeted areasâ€, said Lonyangapuo. Area MP Mark Lomunokol said the programme would help farmers in the region save their livestock from the disease. Lonyangapuo said the vaccination would help to improve livestock productivity and enhance its marketability. West Pokot is the largest supplier of meat to Kitale, Western Kenya, Mai Mahiu, Nairobi and others areas. Read: Livestock ministry launches new foot and mouth vaccine
