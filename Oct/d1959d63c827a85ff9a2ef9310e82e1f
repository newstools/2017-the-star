A 43-year-old man escaped death by a whisker on Saturday evening after an angry mob descended on him for allegedly defiling a 15-year-old mentally disabled girl. The man, only identified as Josee, a boda boda rider in Ruiru town, was rescued by community workers who whisked him away and took him to Ruiru police station. The irate mob was baying for his blood. The crowd demanded that police release the man for them to deal with him. â€œHow can you take such a person to the police? He will be bailed out by his people and continue preying on innocent children,â€ shouted one resident. The girlâ€™s mother told the Star she took her daughter to the doctor and was shocked to learn she was pregnant. Community worker Sevelino Githinji said they could let the suspect die that is why they took him to the police.
