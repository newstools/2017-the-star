Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi and former Governor Peter Munya will share a podium tomorrow when President Uhuru Kenyatta tours the county. Kiraituâ€™s communications officer Patrick Muriungi said the governor will attend all the rallies. He said Kiraitu will spearhead the Presidentâ€™s campaigns. â€œThe President will land at Murungene Primary in Igembe North, then hold roadside public rally at Laare market. He will then proceed to Maua Stadium for a rally, the Kianjai market and finally at River Land in Meru town,â€ Muriungi said. Munyaâ€™s running mate Peter Kaberia, also PNU national treasurer, said they buried the hatchet with Kiraitu after the election and will mobilise support for Uhuru.
