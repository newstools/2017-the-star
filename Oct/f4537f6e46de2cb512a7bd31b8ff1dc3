A woman collapsed and died while performing during Mashujaa Day celebrations in Meru. Grace Atuma fell while dancing as the group presented a song at 1pm. "She was removed and kept aside. I immediately offered my vehicle to take her to hospital and upon reaching she was pronounced dead," said Igembe south deputy county commissioner James Koskey. He said the 65-year-old was excited as they performed and may have experienced shock leading to her sudden death. "We are saddened to lose a hero who was energetically celebrating with others," Koskey said. Atuma was in a group of elderly men and women affiliated to the Mau Mau freedom fighters. The celebrations on Friday were given a wide berth by youths. Governor Kiraitu Murungi and county commissioner Wilfred Nyagwanga presided over the event at Kaaga Primary School in Imenti North. Senator Mithika Linturi, MPs Rahim Dawood (Imenti North) Moses Kirima (Imenti Central) Rindikiri Muruithania (Buuri) Halima Mucheke (nominated) and several MCAs were present.
