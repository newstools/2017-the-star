The national hockey teams will seek to save their blushes when they tackle Nigerian opponents teams in their third matches of the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations in Ismailia, Egypt today. Both the men and women’s teams lost their two previous matches and are therefore automatically out of the tournament with two matches in hand respectively. The women’s team fell 5-0 to champions South Africa Sunday, before they surrendering a 1-0 goal lead to fall 2-1 to bitter rivals Ghana on Monday. It was the same script for their male counterparts who were defeated 3-0 by Ghana on Sunday before Egypt added salt to the wound with a 4-1 drubbing on Monday. However, both teams heads in todays match hoping to make amends and record a win against the West Africans. The Nigerian ladies, with just a point, will seek to push for a win to remain on course of finishing ahead of their opponents in today’s match. “We have to go out there, give our all and win the remaining matches and get a bronze medal,” said the Kenya women’s coach Wilson Otieno. Kenya will play Egypt in their last match on Saturday. The men’s team, on other hand, will seek to record a win against Nigeria who have soaked in a total of 21 goals so far. Nigeria were humiliated 13-1 by Egypt on Sunday before they were white-washed again by South Africa in a 8-1 scoreline on Monday. Goalkeeper Linus Sang said they will be going for nothing but a win against Nigeria. The United States International University -Africa USIU-A player acknowledged they were not lucky in their first two ties and insisted they just have to win against Nigeria. They finish their matches against South Africa on Saturday.
