Gospel singer and uprising celeb Weezdom has opened up on the inner demons he faced during his drug addiction. The Amenitoa Far hit maker battled the addiction for a long time, and by the time he was taken to rehabilitation, he couldnâ€™t speak. â€œThe effects of the drugs I was using were bad, juu ni ya kulewesha viungo vyote vya mwili, especially ulimi. By the time I noticed, I couldnâ€™t speak,â€ Weezdom said. â€œPia nilimaliza eight weeks bila kupiga shower.â€ Weezdom told Kiss FMâ€™s Chito Ndhlovu it was difficult for him to get women to love him. When he was taken to rehab, he made up his mind to do gospel music. â€œNikiwa rehab even before my full recovery I had promised God if he restores me, I will serve him forever. Hata kama ni kukua usher kwa church, I just wanted to serve him. After nilitoka ndio nikaanza kuchase dream ya music.â€ Talking about his fallout with singer Bahati, Weezdom said the singer refused to release many of his projects and only released one song a year. â€œSikua naelewa the main reason why music yangu haikua inatoka. In 2016, I released only one song. People want to hear more from an uprising artiste,â€ he said. â€œIn October last year, I felt wasted. Bahati alizuilia collabo yangu na one of the top female artistes in the country. It really brought me down and I got frustrated.â€
