Tanzania has given Kenyan pastoralist seven-day notice to move out their livestock from gazetted land in Loliondo forest. It is estimated that there are more than 6, 000 cows belonging to Kenyan Maasai in Loliondo Forest. Hundreds of farmers from Kenya who have been tilling the land with more than 200 tractors have also been ordered to leave. The notice was issued by Tanzanian Natural Resources and Tourism Minister Hamisi Kigwangalla, on October 19. It took effect on the same date. “This has caused a lot of damage to the environment. I am now giving the 7 days to pack and leave, failure to which the government will confiscate the more than 200 tractors and over 6, 000 livestock belonging to Kenyans, which will be auctioned by the state,” said Kigwangalla in a statement to the Star. In January this year, the then National Resources and Tourism Minister, Jumanne Maghembe gazetted 1,500 square km which the government set aside for the preservation of the environment. During the same time, Maghembe also set aside 2, 500 sq km of land for public utility. “They have broken the law and their existence there does not only threaten the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem but also reduces the area set aside for the local Tanzanians to graze their livestock,” said the minister. The minister claimed the presence of Kenyans and their livestock is threatening the livelihoods of Tanzanians. He said the state will take drastic measures to control the influx of Kenyan pastoralist into Tanzania. The notice was issued two days after a Tanzania court in Arusha fined Kenyan pastoralists Tsh500 million for trespassing into the country. The Kenyan pastoralists were unable to raise the fine and the court ruled that the 1, 305 cows be confiscated by the state and auction.
