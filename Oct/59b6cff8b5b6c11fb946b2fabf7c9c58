Raila Odinga should stop holding the country at ransom and accept the October 26 polls are going to happen, MP Bernard Shinali has said. The Ikolomani MP has taken swipe at the NASA presidential aspirant for “making moves that divide the nation and for not adhering to the Constitution”. He spoke in Matungu on Saturday as he received 500 defectors from ODM.  Shinale, a Jubilee Party MP, said legally, Raila and his running mate Kalonzo Musyoka are still in the race because the former has not signed Form 24A. “Raila knows the law very well and in fact, he was among those people who drafted this law. Withdrawing doesn’t end with holding press conferences and a letter to the IEBC,” Shinali said. He said NASA may be using the tactic of claiming to have withdrawn from the polls to dupe Jubilee into relaxing from its campaigns, only to catch them unawares by participating in the election. “We can’t live on politicking forever. We need to vote and go back to building the nation,” Shinali said. Raila and his NASA team had laid down a number of demands to be met by the IEBC before the repeat election. Last week, Raila pulled out of the race calling for a fresh election after 90 days that will be free, fair and credible. Shinali said Jubilee is committed to development. “We (MPs) have already allocated money for free secondary education starting in January, placed money to the elderly and those suffering due to drought,” he said. Shinali said money has been allocated for maize subsidies. He accused NASA of risking the lives of Kenyans by telling its supporters to hold protests. “What they know is commanding Kenyans to pick up twigs and go to the streets to demonstrate,” Shinali said.
