Ransomware prevents you from accessing files from an
infected computer until you pay the ransom. 
For the past few months, users especially in Russia and Ukraine have
experienced several strains of ransomware, the latest one being BadRabbit which
targeted consumers and businesses. BadRabbit appears to be automatically downloaded when users
visit legitimate websites, but as it doesn't use any exploits as with previous
ransomware, it relies on the user to run the program manually. It poses as an
Adobe Flash installer. When the program is run, it displays a similar message
to other ransomware and tells users to send just under $300 to a Bitcoin
account.  “It was only a matter of time before someone took the ideas
from WannaCry and NotPetya and ran with them for another go at unsuspecting
victims. It appears this latest variation, the so-called Bad Rabbit ransomware,
is being distributed via a fake Adobe Flash Player installer file,” says Chester
Wisniewski, Principal Research Scientist at Sophos.  “Initial reports are primarily from Eastern Europe,
especially focused on Russia and Ukraine,” he added.  What makes this malware more dangerous than your typical
ransomware being distributed in a similar manner is its ability to spread
across an organization as a worm and not just through email attachments or
vulnerable web plugins. It is rumored to contain the same password stealing and
spreading mechanism as NotPetya, allowing it to traverse an enterprise and
cripple it in no time.  SophosLabs are working to confirm these details. At the
moment their Anti-Virus customers will detect this variation as
Troj/Ransom-ERK.  In addition, IT experts at the company recommend the
