Somali police opened fire to prevent protesters demonstrating against last weekend's deadly bombings from accessing the site of the attack, witnesses and the emergency response service said. The witnesses heard gunfire shortly after police blocked protesters who were marching towards the scene of the twin blasts which killed more than 300 people. Abdikadir Abdirahman, the director of Aamin Ambulances, said one pregnant protester was among those evacuated from the scene. "The other two were also demonstrating. They were injured by bullets which the police fired to disperse the demonstrators who wanted to enter the blast scene by force," he said. Police later allowed the thousands of protesters to gather at the site of the bombing. Read: Somalia in desperate need of blood donations after deadliest bombing
