Starring: Kit Harington, Peter Mullan, Mark Gatiss, Liv Tyler Genre: Period drama Premier: October 21 – November 4    In 1605, an assassination plot on King James I of England was attempted by Catholic loyalists. The plot included using gunpowder to blow up Parliament, the infamous event came to be known as the Gunpowder Plot. It was masterminded by Robert Catesby. The show is a three-part series recapping the events that led to the Gunpowder Plot. It chronicles the life of Catesby and his Catholic compatriots as they try to fight for their right to practise their religion under the Protestant rule of King James.  The Catholics are forbidden to hold mass and those who still practise it, practise in secret under the leadership of wanted priest, Father Henry Garnett.  Catesby and his followers hide Father Garnet from the English inquisition who are searching for him. Driven by revenge and desperation, Catesby resolves to avenge his kin by killing King James and putting a more Catholic-sympathetic ruler in his place.  The show is absurdly gruesome in its portrayal of the torture and killing of sentenced people. Many viewers have called out the producers for being unnecessarily graphic.  However, the show’s creators maintain that the violent scenes are an integral part of retelling history as it were.  Other than its incredulous scenes, the show maintains a great deal of historical accuracy in its representation. The series is definitely a must-watch for history buffs like myself.  Kit Harington (Game of Thrones) takes on the lead role of Catesby. Harington, whose middle name is Catesby, is a direct descendant of Robert Catesby himself. Harington maintained creative control of his ancestor’s story by serving as co-creator and executive producer of the show.    Star Rating: 3/5
