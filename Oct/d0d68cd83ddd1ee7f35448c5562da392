More than 100 students St Christopher Mabanga Girl's School in Kabuchai were treated for suspected food poisoning on Friday. The students complained of stomachaches, diarrhoea, vomiting and headaches after having supper on Thursday evening. Principal Consolata Ong'ong'o said they rushed them to a private hospital due to the ongoing nurses strike. They were taken to Khalaba medical centre in Bungoma Edwin Mutunga, who is the doctor in charge, said all the learners had similar symptoms. Bungoma education director Jacob Onyiego and Richard Sabwami, county representative of Kenya Secondary Heads Association, asked parents not to worry "as the situation is under control". "They were admitted at the nearest facility...we are yet to establish what they are suffering from...let's wait for the results." On September 20, more than 140 Kituro Secondary School students were sent home to seek treatment for suspected food poisoning. Principal Selina Rotich said another lot was hospitalised after complaining of stomach pains after breakfast. "We took them for a check-up at the Baringo county referral hospital in Kabarnet after which 140 were asked to go home for further treatment." She further dismissed claims the school was closed over a cholera outbreak. Read: 140 Baringo students sent home after suspected food poisoning
