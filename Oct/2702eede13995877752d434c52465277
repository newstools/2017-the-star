Professionals from Siaya have asked their MCAs to sit down and talk with their Kiambu counterparts to break the political logjam. Led by Michael Mwiga, they said political opponents Raila Odinga and Uhuru Kenyatta come from the two counties. Mwiga is a professor based in Florida, United States. He said Siaya and Kiambu have a history of perceived bad blood and that it is time they bury the hatchet. He said the two counties need to hold joint assembly sittings  to discuss socio-political matters that can ease tension between them. “This will ensure that peace is sustained in both counties for prosperity and development,” Mwiga said.  Mwiga spoke when he addressed the press on the sidelines of a conflict resolution meeting at a hotel in Siaya town on Monday.  He said MCAs have the closest contact with mwananchi and would therefore be effective in uniting the people.  “It is high time the advice on conflict resolution comes from the lowest level because the top has failed,”he said.
