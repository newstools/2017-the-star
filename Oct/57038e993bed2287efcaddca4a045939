Thousands of Eldoret Youth on Saturday were treated to
electrifying performances during the Safaricom’s Blaze Summit at the Eldoret Sports
Ground. Celebrated musicians Nyashinski, Khaligraph Jones and
rapper King Kaka thrilled the crowds with their electrifying performances. Radio presenter Mwalimu Racheal and musician Timmy TDat emceed the high-pitched event. The
event was part of the Blaze Summits, pegged on the theme Greatness Require Internal Toughness (GRIT). Those
who had the best business ideas from each category took home Sh100,000 in cash
plus Sh10,000 in airtime to kick-start their business.  Local youth auditioned for
the BYOB TV show that will air later in the year.
