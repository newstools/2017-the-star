Relegation-threatened Western Stima missed a gilt edged opportunity to get out of the drop zone as they settled for a 1-1 draw at home to Nakumatt in the Kenya Premier League match. Stima looked to have bagged all three points when Brian Marita put them ahead after the hour mark until Boniface Akenga broke their hearts in stoppage time with the equaliser. That result left Stima second from bottom with 27 points same as Thika United and Mathare United, who however, have a superior goal difference. All the three sides have played 28 matches. Stima will still be glad to have their survival hopes still in their hands as the campaign shuttles towards its business end. Muhoroni Youth remain bottom with 24 points albeit with two games in hand over their fellow strugglers. For Nakumatt, the point was crucial in their quest to stay clear of the dreaded zone with just half a dozen matches left to play. The supermarket side have 32 points and moved a place up to 12th in the standings. Outgoing champions Tusker could not find their way past league newcomers Kariobangi Sharks, settling for a point apiece after their goal-less stalemate. Sharks are fifth in the standings with the brewers now down to eighth. Sharks had Masoud Juma in the starting line up alongside Novella Ochieng. The former Sony Sugar and Bandari striker had just returned to the country on Tuesday morning from national duty when Harambee Stars toured Thailand and Iraq for two friendly games. His presence could not, however, fire them past the Ruaraka side.
