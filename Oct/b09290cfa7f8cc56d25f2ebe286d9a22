At least four people, including a police officer, were injured in Huruma and Mathare on Friday as police battled anti-election protesters.  Traders suffered losses due to looting and having to close early. A policeman was injured in the head while clearing barricades mounted on the road by NASA supporters. He was treated at a mission hospital in Eastleigh and discharged. Mathare AP commander Kiprono Lang’at said a rioter threw a stone at a sergeant from a storeyed building, prompting other officers to fire teargas canisters at the structure. “We are telling them to stop it [throwing stones at police officers from buildings] because if they provoke the police to throw teargas canisters at the houses, it will harm those inside, who are mostly women and children,” he said.
