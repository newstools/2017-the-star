Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala and his predecesor Boni Khalwale on Friday led peaceful NASA demonstrations in Kakamega. They said the alliance’s supporters will camp at polling stations on the Eve of Election Day to prevent elections from taking place. Malala, Khalwale and MCAs led demonstrators who were escorted by police through Kenyatta Avenue, Canon Awori and Sudi streets before presenting a memorandum to the regional IEBC offices. “We were earlier telling our people to vote for our candidate Raila Odinga, but now we’re telling them that there will be no election without Raila on the ballot,” Malala said. Raila and his running mate Kalonzo Musyoka on Tuesday pulled out of the October poll and demanded that IEBC cancels it, schedule another.
