Visa yesterday announced the launch of their foundation that will focus on growing micro and small enterprises around the world. To mark its inception, the Visa Foundation is making its first financial commitment of up to Sh2 billion ($20 million) to support millions of women-led small and micro enterprises. “At the heart of the Visa Foundation is the belief that micro and small enterprises are the backbone of the global economy,” Visa said in a statement. “In fact, small and medium enterprises account for more than 90 per cent of enterprises worldwide, and contribute 50-60 percent of global employment.” While noting that SMEs continue to struggle to access the adequate capital and training required to enable to them thrive, Visa said the foundation aims to rectify this imbalance.
