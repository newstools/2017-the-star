Children are the majority of malaria victims following an outbreak in North Horr, Marsabit county, health officials have said. They said the death toll has risen from 23 to 30 and many patients are in critical condition. At the Dukana Health Centre, a two-month-old baby is among two children receiving treatment for malaria. "The blood levels are critically down and they had severe headaches," a nurse said. County health director Adano Kochi said on Thursday that the county government and humanitarian agencies have scaled-up efforts to offer treatment and supply medication. He said 164 people have been treated in various health facilities in the county. Governor Mahamud Ali lauded nurses for ending their three-month strike to assist residents following the outbreak. "All nurses came in to help those suffering from the disease. Many agencies led by Kenya Red Cross are also playing a vital role," he said. Subcounty health director Huko Halake said facilities over the last two weeks have been overwhelmed by hundreds of patients seeking treatment and tests. Health CS
