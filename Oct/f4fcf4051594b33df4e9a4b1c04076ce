Kandara MP Alice Wahome yesterday moved to court seeking
orders to restrain NASA leader Raila Odinga from calling and conducting
demonstrations during election tomorrow. Wahome also wants Raila and NASA restrained from interfering
with the 'peaceful conduct' of the presidential rerun. Raila has been campaigning to ensure the election is not held successfully. Wahome wants the High Court to also give orders restraining Raila
from campaigning beyond the current campaign window. “Respondents have been inciting their supporters in rallies
and through the media to ensure that repeat presidential election do to take place on
the scheduled date,” Wahome said. She said that recent protests and demonstrations
organised by NASA have been violent resulting in deaths, looting and destruction
of property. “It is highly probable that the demonstrations scheduled for
Thursday will also be violent as has been the norm in other protests,” Wahome says in her affidavit. She further claims that IEBC officials have been harassed
and attacked in NASA strongholds of Bondo, Vihiga and Kisumu. The attacks were aimed at stopping preparations for the election. “The pronouncements by NASA that there shall be no elections on October 26 continue to instill fear in voters in cosmopolitan areas and other places deemed to be their political strongholds,” Wahome says. She said the threats and attacks by NASA supporters could lead to chaos. “Utterances and provocations by NASA leaders continue to invoke ethnic
animosity against members of communities viewed as political opponents and who
are keen to vote on Thursday,” Wahome says. She said election can only take place in a conducive environment which is free from violence and intimidation. The MP asked the court to grant the orders she sought. She said that the court had a duty to issue injunctions
to prevent a violation, infringement or threats towards the promotion
of fundamental rights and freedoms of its citizens.
