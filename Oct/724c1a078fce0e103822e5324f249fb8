Health CS Cleopa Mailu yesterday dismissed NASA leader Raila Odingaâ€™s allegations that the government administered tetanus vaccine secretly laced with a hormone to cause miscarriage and infertility in women. He said the issue was only a major concern in its initial stages of implementation. It was, however, swiftly resolved, he said. â€œThere were challenges in 2013-14 on how immunisation should be carried out. The onset was for everybody to feel comfortable with mass vaccination,â€ Mailu (pictured) said. â€œIn 2014, we agreed to have a technical working group that once mass vaccine comes, we subject vaccination to test, not because the source is not known.â€ Mailu said revisiting the unresolved controversial topic â€œwas ill-advised, untimely and unnecessaryâ€. Last month, Raila said the government deliberately sterilised thousands of women between ages 14-49. He said investigations by four credible institutions on the vaccine revealed it had compounds with high amounts of anti-pregnancy hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin, which renders women and girls sterile. Mailu spoke during the annual general meeting and health conference for the Catholic Health Commission of Kenya. Raila said the Catholic Church was right in opposing the jab. Catholic Cardinal John Njue had urged Kenyans to reject the vaccine, claiming it had been laced with an antigen that could cause sterility in women. He also told members of the Church to reject GMO foods, claiming â€œcertain powers with a hidden agenda were behind themâ€.
