Mwingi detectives raided legislator Gideon Mulyungi's Kalisasi home on Friday to "see him" following claims he is missing. DCIO Simon Mongera led the operation also because of allegations the Mwingi Central MP issued defamatory statements at Kalundu market in Kitui town on Saturday. "[President] Uhuru [Kenyatta] is not superman. I think we are equal where it matters as men," the lawmaker reportedly said on Saturday, during the Kamba declaration on the repeat election. Mongera noted media reports that Mulyungi cannot be found after he was summoned to record a statement over the defamation claims. "We wanted to make sure we had seen him but we searched his house and saw he was not here [sic]. We only found the house girl and mother. The search continues." The house girl told the press she gave the mansion's keys to police and that they searched everywhere. "I even told police Mulyungi is too senior a person to stoop to the level of hiding under the bed. I also cannot hide under the bed. He is not in the house," she said. "I also haven't seen him since Saturday." Mulyungi has been in the hiding since Sunday and later told the press via WhatsApp that he will remain where he is since police are looking for him. The claims he is missing are not by his family members but by his supporters. The family has not filed a missing person's report. A supporter identified as Mwende Salu said Mwingi Central residents wants to see their MP in good health and that police should stop intimidating him.
