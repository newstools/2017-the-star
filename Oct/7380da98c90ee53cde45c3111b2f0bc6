Governors Anyang’ Nyong’o, Paul Chepkwony and Stephen Sang have urged the national government to speedily address boundary disputes to end conflicts between the Luo and Kalenjin communities. The conflicts have largely been attributed to disputes on the border of Kisumu, Kericho and Nandi counties, bad politics and cattle rustling. The three leaders held a peace meeting in Kericho town on Saturday. This was after George Ojwang, 60, was killed in ethnic clashes in Koguta village, Muhoroni subcounty. His body was found in a sugarcane plantation on Sunday morning. The body had three arrows in its back and severe head wounds. Seven cows had been stolen on Saturday and residents from both communities armed themselves. Sugarcane plantations in Muhoroni were burnt. “Our communities need one another to build their counties and spur economic activities,” Sang said.
