The murder case of human rights lawyer Willie Kimani and two others has been delayed yet again, after one of the defense lawyers failed to show up yesterday. It was the second time in a row the prosecution was forced to hold on to its evidence because of the absence of lawyer Cliff Ombeta. “The court cannot keep waiting for him for so long,” Justice Jessie Lesiit said. The case against Fredrick Leliman, Stephen Chebulet, Leonard Maina, Silvia Wanjiku and Peter Ngugi had been scheduled to resume, but will now wait until tomorrow. Justice Lesiit postponed the hearing on July 31. Already, 34 witnesses have testified and 11 more are remaining before the case is closed. An investigator with the Independent Policing Oversight Authority was expected to take the stand yesterday. The prosecution also want to call another officer, who, they say, will explain the movement of a police pocket radio phone alleged to have been traced to the murder scene. They have been trying to link the pocket radio to Leliman, who had been assigned one a few days before June 23 last year, when Kimani, his client Josephat Mwenda and taxi driver Joseph Muiruri were murdered. A witness previously said Leliman, who headed an undercover police unit of five known as “Spiv”, had been allocated a pocket radio a few days before the killings. The suspects have been asked by the judge to decide on what to do should Ombeta fail to show up tomorrow. Ombeta sent lawyer James Mochere, who is representing one of the accused, to hold his brief, but because the prosecution intended to call a new witness, the accused said they wanted their lawyer to be present. “We ask you to give us another chance. If he does not come the next time, we’ll then make our decision” Chebulet said.
