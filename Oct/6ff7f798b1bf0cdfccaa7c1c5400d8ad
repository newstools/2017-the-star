KCPE examination candidates in terror-prone areas of Lamu have been moved to a safer centre at Mokowe Arid Zone Primary School. The centre was established by the government in 1992 for children from the minority Boni and Sanye communities. All schools in Basuba, Lamu, have remained closed for over two years because of attacks by al Shabaab. There are concerns candidates, who have not been in school, will perform poorly. They will sit the examination at Mokowe, which has boarding facilities. The school is under 24-hour surveillance by police.  Lamu East Education officer David Nzinga said there were concerns about how the pupils would perform since their studies were disrupted. “Their schools haven’t been opened for the last two years because of insecurity. The pupils have faced many challenges, but we are praying for the best. Mokowe is peaceful and safe,” Nzinga said. At Pandanguo Primary School in Lamu West,19 KCPE exam candidates will now sit their exams at the Witu Primary School.  Their school was shut mid this year because of insecurity. A majority of the pupils are from the Boni community. Pandanguo has been closed since July 4 owing to persistent attacks by al Shabaab. Many of the candidates have been living in IDP camps with their parents, who fled their villages in Pandanguo after the militants killed several people. Parents are concerned about the performance of their children. “My two sons are sitting the exam. Unfortunately, we have been living in an IDP camp in Katsaka Kairu since July. They haven’t been in school because their teachers also ran away,” said Abdulla Guyo of Pandanguo village “Although we’re happy they’ve been moved to another school, we know it won’t make any difference. They have lost a lot,” Guyo said. They neither completed the syllabus nor revised for the exams. Meanwhile, all is set for the examination.  Lamu county commissioner Gilbert Kitiyo assured schools of adequate security.
