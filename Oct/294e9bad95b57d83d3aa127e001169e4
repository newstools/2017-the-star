This week has been one for the record books. It had two working days and a five-day weekend and, on top of that, Kenyans got free transport to shagz. Even during Christmas holidays, things don’t work out like that.....But then again, it’s Kenya and peculiar things only happen in Kenya. The reason why weekends are only limited to less than two days is because slay queens watamaliza mifuko yetu. We cannot sustain a whole week of drinking. Using December holiday as a case study....Enough of the long and the never ending holiday that has left many pockets mourning. Let’s look at the Bar-Litics of this long weekend and how Kenyans partied. Sunday School was at 1824  or Jiweke Sunday plan. Come Monday, Tamasha and all the other clubs in the CBD and Buruburu — the land of all slay queens — were still happening. On Tuesday, Soccer Night was at K1 Klub House, while Kenyans were still enjoying on Wednesday — the eve to the election — at Tribeka and Club Rumours. Not to mention B Club, where even some honorable MPs were part of the party The only club that closed shop on Wednesday and Thursday night was Kiza, but that didn’t stop Kenyans from going out both nights, with clubs such as Space Lounge, Forty-40 and Privee making good business. Friday was supposed to be a work day but many Kenyans didn't show up anyway,  extending the two-day holiday to three.  It’s not yet end month but Kenyans are partying like it’s is. And even after a five-day impromptu weekend. it’s amazing how Kenyans are still able to spend each night and every weekend.
