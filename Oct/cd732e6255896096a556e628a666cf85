ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi should be elected President in 2022 since his party is stronger than ever, Kwhisero MP Christopher Aseka has said. The lawmaker said Mudavadi has built a strong party that is capable of uniting the nation. He also said NASA leader Raila Odinga won the August election, adding that last week's election was a sham. “Raila won the election and as a party, we will do our best to support the will of the people as we await 2022,” Aseka said. He spoke in Kwhisero on Sunday. Aseka also faulted the Registrar of Political Parties for blocking the appointment of Barrack Muluka as ANC secretary general. The Registrar of Political Parties on October 16 declined the appointment of Muluka, saying the office had received a complaint from Evans Nyaribo. In his complaint, Nyaribo said the party did not follow the right procedure in the appointment of Muluka. The party had agreed to give Muluka the seat on interim basis. Muluka took over the seat after the party nominated Godfery Ososti to the National Assembly. “The case is filed by a person who wants to derail the party from its ambition of ruling this nation in 2022,” Aseka said. The MP said instead of Nyaribo taking the matter to the Registrar of Political Parties, he should have first exhausted the party avenues of solving such matters. ANC got five National Assembly seats out of the 12 in Kakamega county. In the county assembly the party got 19 members out of 60 MCAs.
