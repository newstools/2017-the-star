Did IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati goof when he declared that approximately 48 per cent of registered voters cast their ballot on Thursday? Well, IEBC on June 27 said it had registered a total of 19,611,423 voters ahead of the August 8 general election. Latest actual figures from 267 constituencies show 6,553,858 Kenyans turned out to vote. Chebukati said this was the best estimate based on data from poll officials on the ground. "The 48% was a best estimate turnout from the team," he said during a press brief at Bomas of Kenya. But if 6,553,858 had been certified by poll officials as having voted
across 267 constituencies, the turnout stands at 33.41 per cent. The electoral agency chief made another numerical blunder by saying the national tallying centre had received 27,124 forms 34A. While this was said to be representing 80 per cent of the total number of polling stations, some quarters read otherwise. The total number of polling stations is 40,883.  If 27,124 forms had
turned up on the public portal by 5pm, this would give 66.34 per cent
and not 80 per cent as Chebukati stated. Despite the criticism, the electoral agency boss defended the figures. "We continue to receive data as the devices report and shall provide a comprehensive update on Friday morning," he said via twitter.
