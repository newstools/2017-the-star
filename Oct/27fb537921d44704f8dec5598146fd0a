Likoni MP Mishi Mboko has claimed former Mombasa Senator Hassan Omar has been paid off to join Jubilee. Omar defected to Jubilee on Sunday saying he wanted to change Mombasa. Prior to joining the ruling party, the former Wiper politician termed President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto incompetent. Mboko said Omar's defection is about personal desire triggered by a financial crunch. She said his dream of becoming Mombasa kingpin is laughable and premature. “He is just like [former Likoni MP Masoud] Mwahima,” she said on Monday. Mwahima decamped from ODM to Jubilee after losing his seat to Mboko. Before defecting, Mwahima was captured carrying “loaded” brown
envelope from State House Mombasa. He later said the envelope contained certificates of his
supporters. Mboko said Omar, who lost in the Mombasa Governor race, is afraid of competing with "real men".

He has failed to talk about issues and opted to engage with women like Mboko and [Malindi MP Aisha] Jumwa. Come we teach you how to yap," she added. On Sunday, Omar said Coast is "fond of electing illiterates like
Mboko and Jumwa" and it was time the trend changed. He said this was the reason NASA failed to give some of them House
leadership. He compared the two with elected leaders from Rift Valley, some of
whom are professors or former dons of Egerton University and Moi
University. But Mboko maintained they are still Raila's generals and Omar's
abuse will not reduce them. “Mombasa is for Raila,” Mboko said adding no amount of
intimidation will distract their course of removing IEBC CEO Ezra
Chiloba from office. She and other Mombasa leaders spoke when the took part in
anti-IEBC demonstrations. Present were Deputy Governor William Kingi, Mvita MP Abdulswamad
Nassir and Changamwe MP Omar Mwinyi. Also read: We'll shave Raila with rusty razor, give Uhuru all votes - Coast leaders
