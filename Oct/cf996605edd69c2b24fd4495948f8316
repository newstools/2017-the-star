The largest elephants with the heaviest tusks are at risk of extinction due to the high rate of poaching, a conservation lobby has said.  "The tusks weighing 45kg and 48kg are believed to have come from the same elephant, making it one of Africa's famed Great Tuskers,"Space for Giants communications director Mike Pflanz told the Star on Wednesday. He said the international organisation monitors trials of poachers, speeds up proceedingsÂ  and has prevented the collapse of trials by helping to provide witnesses and substantive evidence. "Space for Giants provide an extra pair of eyes and ears on these proceedings, and step in to support the authorities. In court trials at Nkubu, we ensured a witness and the two tusks were brought to court to be presented as exhibits," Pflanz said. The organisation has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the DPP, KWS and National Police Service. "Space for Giants has projects across Africa to help strengthen judicial systems and improve trial preparations. This work is aimed at making sure increasingly strict laws against wildlife crimes are enforced, making the threat of legal action a real deterrent against such activities," Pflanz said.  Nkubu senior resident magistrate Joan Irura will rule on October 17 whether Francis Mutegi has a case to answer. He is accused of possession of the above two tusks worth Sh9.3 million without permit.  Principal magistrate Monica Maroro on Wednesday adjourned hearing of Ivory case to December 5, where Mutegi is charged with possession of two tusks weighing 15.5kg and 14kgs respectively valued at Sh. 2 million, citing backlog of wildlife crime cases which are referred to her court. Mutegi had pleaded not guilty and was released on a cash bail of Sh. 5 million or bond of Sh 10 million with surety of similar amount.
