The Anti-Doping Agency of Kenya (ADAK) has implored on coaches and sports federations to embrace anti-doping activities with a view to promote clean sports and ensure the well-being of athletes is taken care of. Speaking during an Anti-Doping Education Workshop for over 150 coaches and sports officials from various sports federations in Nairobi region, Adak director of Anti-Doping Education and Research, Agnes Mandu, said there is need to for anti-doping sensitization by federations before taking part in major championships. â€œOur mandate is well articulated in the anti-doping Act, 2016. We are also guided by the laws governing sports in this country and it is for this reason that we are engaging all stakeholders in the industry with a view to safeguard our athletes, in particular, and the reputation of the country which is revered for its sporting talent in general.  As ADAK, we wish to urge all of you to support our efforts in a bid to create an enabling environment for sports,â€ said Mandu. Over 30 sports organisations in Nairobi region attended the clinic.  They covered various topics includingâ€”Anti-Doping rule violation, prohibited list, Therapeutic Use Exemption, consequences of doping and the roles and responsibilities of officials in the Doping Control Process. Dr. Pramod Shah, a medic who has a wide range of experience in providing medical support services to sports personalities locally and internationally, underscored the importance of the sensitization workshop.  â€œBefore ADAK came into existence the anti-doping campaign was not as intensive as it is. Most athletes and their support personnel, as well as the general public, had to rely on the media for information. We are glad that Adak is now leading the fight against this vice through sensitization and education before testing,â€ said Dr. Shah.
