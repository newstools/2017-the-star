The Kenyan shilling yesterday shrunk to its lowest against the dollar since August, trading Sh103.75/85 against the greenback as the country gears up for the fresh presidential election on Thursday. According to Reuters, the depreciation prompted the Central Bank of Kenya to intervene, pumping in dollars to curb the volatility which is being attributed to foreign investor flight due to the current political instability. The CBK mean trading rate for the dollar maintained at Sh103.55 for the better part of the day before gaining to close the day at Sh103.41. On Thursday, it closed at Sh103.20. Last week, the Capital Market Authority quarterly statistic showed that Sh11.1 billion of foreign equity was wiped out of the country’s money market last month. Although the shilling resisted election pressure before the August 8 general election, trading at a monthly average of Sh103.40, it started to depreciate after the September 1 Supreme Court ruling, reaching a recent high of Sh103.87 on October 1. Besides the dollar, the shilling has depreciated against the other international and regional currencies. Financial experts have warned of further depreciation if the current political bickering persists.
