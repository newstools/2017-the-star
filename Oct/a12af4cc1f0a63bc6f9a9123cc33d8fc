 Vera Sidika has come out to rubbish claims that her exotic holiday to the maldives is being sponsored by vice president of Equatorial Guinea Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue (Teddy Ngeuma) whose father is the president of the same nation. Teddy is said to have had a fling with another Kenyan socialite Huddah Monroe, Sidika's rival and he flew her out of the country to Equatorial Guinea a few months ago. Well, Vera who is currently on holiday in Maldives has addressed rumours linking her to the politician. Vera wrote, "Y'all google the One & Only Reethi Rah, Maldives and tell me if it looks anything like my hotel!! How can people claim someone is with me when I'm on an island far away. You need a flight to get here! As in, the bed, bathroom, zero similarities." Adding, "Broke and basic hating Kenyan b*tches. How can someone say I'm with some dude just because I'm in Maldives and they are in Maldives? There are 1,220 islands in this place. Can't y'all just let me be! The One & Only Reethi Rah don't even look like this." Clearly, Vera doesn't want to be associated with the men Huddah has been with and she set the record straight saying she pays her own bills and she had planned to visit Maldives for her birthday. "I promised myself I'll go to Maldives or Santorini for my birthday this year. I pay cash for my business class flights and hotels. Y'all stop giving credit to people for my money! Stop it! This has been going on for too long. Just stop." The bootylicious socialite also clarified that she's a self-made millionaire. "Even when I'm in a relationship and you see me living lavishly it's all me. Not the man. I make promises to myself and keep them. I never disappoint myself. Men will always disappoint you even if it's your damn birthday, anniversary or just a mere promise."
