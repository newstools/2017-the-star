Former Vihiga Governor Moses Akaranga and former National Assembly Speaker Kenneth Marende gave Jubilee a raw deal, Senator George Khaniri has said. He said even after President Uhuru Kenyatta visited the county a week before the repeat presidential election, Jubilee did not meet their 100,000 votes target. Jubilee should have known Vihiga county is a NASA zone, Khaniri said. The senator spoke on Sunday at Musembe Friends Church. “Akaranga, former MPs Yusuf Chanzu of Vihiga and Vincent Mmaitsi of Hamisi lost miserably at the August election. How did Jubilee expect them to bring them votes,” Khaniri said. Akaranga, Chanzu ,Marende, and Mmaitsi promised Jubilee in various forums that they will deliver at least 20, 000 votes from each of the five sub county in the county. He said even the Sh10 million that Ruto gave to the Pentecostal Assemblies of God in Nyangori last month did not translate to votes. People of Vihiga have all the reasons of not supporting Jubilee, because it has neglected the county in terms of government appointments, Khaniri said. “In the past regimes, we used to have ministerial position, but in Jubilee, we have nothing,” Khaniri said. “We will not support a regime that is oppressing our people. Jubilee has made life difficult for our people." He asked police to withdraw a case in which Central Maragoli MCA Evans Chunguli was arrested for incitement. The senator said if police want to proceed with the case, he will bring in NASA lawyers.
