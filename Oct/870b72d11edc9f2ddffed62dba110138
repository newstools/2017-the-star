Joyciline Jepkosgei took one
second off her own world record when she won the Valencia Half
Marathon in a time of one hour 4.51 seconds on Sunday. The multiple world record-holder reached 15 kilometres in
45:59 which put her target in jeopardy -- when she set the
previous record of 1:04:52 in Prague in April, she had clocked
45:37 at the same stage. Jepkosgei dug deep in the closing stages, however, and by
the 20-km mark, where she clocked 1:01:30, she was only five
seconds off world-record pace. A thrilling run down the final straight allowed her to beat
the clock and reach the finish line in 1:04:51 to set her sixth
world record this year. “It was my first race in Valencia, I enjoyed a lot, the
weather is nice, the circuit is perfect to run fast,” said
Jepkosgei, who will turn 24 in December. “I hope to come back in
March for the World Half Marathon Championships.” Bahrain’s Abraham Cheroben won the men’s race in 59:11,
grabbing his third win in four years in Valencia.
