Meru county commissioner Wilfred Nyagwanga (pictured) has said there are enough police officers to man exam centers to ensure the election does not disrupt KCSE and KCPE examinations. He said police have been deployed in schools to ensure a peaceful environment conducive to thinking. Nyagwanga, who spoke to press on Thursday, urged residents to exercise caution after the poll and avoid confrontations. He said police are on high alert to arrest those who cause poll-related chaos. “We will also arrest those selling and consuming illicit brews in this electioneering period,” he said. Meru police boss Nelson Taliti said a total of 1,902 police officers had been deployed to the 951 polling stations spread across the county in nine constituencies.
