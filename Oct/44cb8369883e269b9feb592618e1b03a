Nakuru county lacks well-equipped ambulances and skilled personnel, medics and residents have said. During an emergency, the county government relies on Kenya Red Cross's two ambulances based in Naivasha and Nakuru town. Residents said some ambulances have stalled due to lack of drivers and trained paramedics. They spoke at a public hearing chaired by Prof James Tuitoek, who heads the Nakuru county health taskforce. The team was formed by Governor Lee Kinyanjui to look into what is ailing the health sector. The county has 23 ambulances, but only eight are functional. Others were written off after being involved in road accidents. In addition, the county does not have a regional call centre, and in case of mass casualties, Red Cross is called in.
