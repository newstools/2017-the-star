Gospel singer Size 8 has revealed that the inspiration behind her single Mwambia, is a close pal of hers who was involved with a gangster. "I have a friend who got pregnant for a gangster and he was later killed. Currently, I have someone who is close to me who is in prison because he was a gangster. So its something that is not a shock, it is just that right now there is no shame, everything now is just done in the open. Mwambie song is actually for that crowd, I'm talking to them." Size 8 weighed in on the recent extrajudiacial killings by the city's most fierce cop, Hessy. "There is a thin line, I don't know if I will be crucified for saying this, but some of the things that these boys do are not good that might justify them being gunned down. But we should not take law into our own hands. It is good to give people the opportunity to go to trial in court. The Bible still calls for giving people a second chance." The Pambio TV show host added, "That's  why I am saying there is a thin line, for someone whose wife has been raped by criminals, it will be easy to say shoot on sight. But if you ask the mother who has been praying and fasting for this boy, she will take him to prison that he may get a chance to be saved even though he will never come out."
