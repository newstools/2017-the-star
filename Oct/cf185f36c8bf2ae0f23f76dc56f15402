Three Homa Bay politicians have criticised IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati for rescheduling the repeat presidential poll on Saturday. Chebukati called off the elections in Homa Bay, Kisumu, Migori and Siaya on Thursday. He cited violence and the fact that most polling stations failed to open. Speaking to the Star on Friday, Homa Bay woman representative Gladys Wanga, Millie Odhiambo (Mbita MP) and former Kasipul MP Oyugi Magwanga said the election will interfere with freedom of worship. Magwanga said a majority of voters in the region go to church on Saturday. “There is no doubt most residents in Nyanza worship on Saturday. A majority of them are SDAs,” Magwanga said. The former MP asked the IEBC to tell Kenyans where it will get electoral officials to man the election since the ones assigned refused to turn up on Thursday. “Let the IEBC tell us if it has recruited new officials,” he said. Wanga and Odhiambo said residents boycotted the Thursday poll and that position will not change on Saturday. The electoral agency wants to force people to participate in an election they do not trust, Wanga said. “The IEBC is playing in the Jubilee gallery. We will not fall for their tricks,” she said.  Odhiambo accused the electoral agency of making the repeat presidential election a regional affair. She claimed compelling counties in Luo Nyanza to hold the poll on Saturday is profiling the community. “It’s good to respect the rights of all Kenyans,” Odhiambo said. The politicians urged police to avoid using excessive force on protesters. NASA leader Raila Odinga withdrew from the race and urged his supporters to boycott the ‘sham’ election.
