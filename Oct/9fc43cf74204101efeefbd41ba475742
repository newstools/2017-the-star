The death penalties do little to deter crimes or serve victims, UN secretary general António Guterres said on Tuesday. “The death penalty has no place in the 21st century,” he said. Guterres urged all countries that have yet to  ban the extreme practice to “urgently stop executions”. The world over, 170 states have either abolished the death penalty – the most recent bbeing Gambia and Madagascar. In Kenya, five crimes are classified as capital offences under the Penal Code. They are murder, treason, oathing for criminal activities by proscribed criminal outfits, robbery and attempted robbery with violence. The law prescribes death as the only sentence for convicts of such offences. Kamiti Prison alone has more than 130 prisoners with death penalty sentences. President Uhuru Kenyatta in October last year commuted 2,747 death row convicts — 2,655 males and 92 females — to serve life imprisonment.  World Day Against the Death Penalty is observed yearly on October 10. This years’ theme was “Poverty and Justice: A Deadly Mix”. Guterres expressed concern that countries that continue executions also fail to meet international obligations.
