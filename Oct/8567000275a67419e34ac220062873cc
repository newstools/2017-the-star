The Willie Kimani murder case is set to resume on Monday after a recess. The human rights lawyer was murdered alongside his client Josephat Mwenda and taxi driver Joseph Muiruri in June 2016. Four Administration Police officers are among five people charged with their torture and murder. Some 34 prosecution witnesses have testified and 11 more are expected as it closes its case. The prosecution will have 10 days to present additional witnesses before Justice Jessie Lessit. The AP officers facing murder charges are Fredrick Leliman, Sylvia Wanjiry, Leonard Mwangi and Stephen Cheburet. Informer Peter Ngugi alias Brown is the fifth suspect. Before adjourning for the August 8 general election, a government doctor testified and linked Ngugi to the scene of the killings using DNA evidence. Dr Joseph Kimani said five cigarette butts collected at the murder scene were traced to Ngugi. A police officer in charge of communications at Machakos county was the last witness to testify before the court went on recess. He played a DVD recording in court showing the movements of a police mobile phone issued to Syokimau police post where the victims were detained before their murder. For the first time, the court allowed victims' lawyers to participate and ask questions. This is after the International Justice Mission where Kimani worked made an application to grant victims the rights to question witnesses. Kimani, Muiruri and Mwenda were abducted while leaving Mavoko Law courts on June 23, 2016. Their bodies were found dumped in Ol Donyo Sabuk river on July 1, 2016.
