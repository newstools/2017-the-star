Kwale governor Salim Mvurya's speech to teachers was briefly interrupted on Saturday by a rowdy crowd who started uttering anti-Jubilee slogans.  Mvurya who was campaigning for Uhuru Kenyatta said NASA Chief Raila Odinga is not a straightforward person because he went to court claiming elections were rigged yet he now wants to boycott the fresh elections.  â€œWe donâ€™t know what is wrong with the opposition. Every time they are complaining like I donâ€™t want Chiloba, OT-Morpho and now even Safaricom,â€ he said.  The teachers became hostile over the remarks and started murmuring NASA slogans. They then begun shouting NASA hao and Tibiim. â€œWe donâ€™t want Uhuru Kenyatta anymore, he told teachers there is no salary increment so why should we vote for him,â€ some of the teachers shouted.  The governor had attended the Teacher for Teachers graduation ceremony after the successful completion of the training sponsored by donors from Netherlands. Mvurya carried on with his speech amid the shouts from the group he was addressing.  â€œI know we have different perspectives on this issue but that is okay since everybody is free to choose whoever they want. Am only requesting you to go and vote when the time comes,â€ he said.  Mvurya urged the teachers not to be used by selfish leaders in causing violence noting that peace is a priority to all citizens.  â€œNow that there are the anti-IEBC demos going on in the country, am requesting you as your governor to stay calm and donâ€™t engage in any form of violence,â€ he added.
