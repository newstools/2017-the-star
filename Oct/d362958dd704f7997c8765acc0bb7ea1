Dela Maranga is one of the best vocalists in Kenya and will be headlining the United Sounds Of Africa on Saturday.  Among those who will attend are Nigeria's Runtown and our very own Kagwe Mungai and Khaligraph Jones. Tanzania's Navy Kenzo and Lady Jaydee will also be gracing the event. Talking exclusively to Word Is, the Mafeelings hitmaker told fans to wait for the best, as she will be giving them a surprise on stage.  We could not help but talk about how she was accused by a local photographer of doing drugs, and that even her friends did not want to take pictures with her. "A lot has been said about me. Sometimes some things are said that could affect my life. Rumours have been going on that I'm on drugs. I'm not on drugs. That's not a funny joke about somebody, that's character assassination." She continued to pour her heart out: "I didn't take it lightly and at the same time I didn't want it to affect me. Some people should be more careful about what they write about other people." When asked if such controversy made her not get gigs, the Adabu hitmaker denied it.  "So far not so good. I'm still gigging, I'm still working, I was on a tour before that. I would say that I haven't been affected." She added: "I think I would have probably gone to court if it started affecting my money."
