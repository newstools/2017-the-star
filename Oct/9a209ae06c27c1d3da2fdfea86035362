Acting Interior CS Fred Matiang’i has said adequate security measures have been put in place to ensure the repeat presidential election take place as planned.  Speaking on Sunday in Nyamira county, Matiang'i said the government will ensure proper security during and after the Thursday election. "There is nothing to fear because the government is ready to counter any form of disruption during the elections,” Matiang'i said.  He was speaking during the opening of Igena Itambe health center in Bosamaro ward, West Mugirango constituency.  He was accompanied by Walter Nyambati, former minister Henry Obwocha and lawyer Ken Ogeto. Nyambati contested the Nyamira governorship on the Jubilee ticket in August but lost to John Nyangarama. Matiang'i cautioned youths against demonstrations organised by NASA, saying members of the Gusii community are not known to take to the streets. "Our community does not belong to the streets. If there is any misunderstanding, let us use legal ways of solving it," he said. Matiang'i urged residents to come out on Thursday and vote for President Uhuru Kenyatta in large numbers. Nyamira county commissioner Isaiah Nakoru said the government will deal with any person who dare to disrupt the repeat election.  Obwocha said Jubilee will win the repeat election because Nyamira residents have promised to vote for its candidate. 
"Let us all support Uhuru because he has been working for us," Obwocha said.
