Local travelers prefer making their travel bookings via mobile phones as opposed to making calls or desktop bookings, a new report shows.  The quarter-three survey by Jumia Travel dubbed Customer Behavior and Online Trends shows that mobile bookings increased from 41 per cent in the second quarter to 44 per cent in the period under review. The increase saw desktop bookings dip from 59 per cent to 56 per cent in the same period. Commenting on the trend, Jumia Travel Country Manager Cyrus Onyiego said the trend can only grow, as more shoppers and travelers embrace both mobile and cross-device shopping experience. While terming smartphones as the primary contact for ecommerce, the country manager called on suppliers to create a seamless purchase process as consumers transit from eCommerce to mCommerce, as well as adopt effective mobile-centric marketing strategies. The report, released early this week, also indicated that 89 per cent of the guests read reviews every time or most of the times before they book a trip or hotel. This has seen hotels with excellent reviews get more bookings than their not-so-well rated counterparts. This new trend has seen brands invest more in customer experience rather than a marketing budget, hence they are highly rewarded through loyalty and unsolicited referrals by customers. However, compared to the first half of 2017, quarter three payment preferences took a new turn with a steep rise in post pay (pay at hotel) transactions at 69 per cent, up from 52 per cent. On the other hand, pre-pay customers dropped from the previously recorded 48 per cent to end the quarter at 31 per cent. As customers consider online transactions risky, 73 per cent of them preferred to book with hotels that provide pay-at-hotel option, while the remaining 27 per cent are okay with either. Fraudulent use of payment networks and data were outlined as the leading causes to this effect.
