NASA leaders are criminals who must be stopped, Nyandarua assembly speaker Wahome Ndegwa has said. “We cannot continue calling them opposition leaders or leaders within any political landscape. We are dealing with criminals. Warlords beating drums of war,” he said. Ndegwa spoke on Friday at ACK Hall in Ol Kalou. He said despite the prevailing political climate, Kenya has to move on, as it is bigger than any individual. Ndegwa said Kenyans have nothing to fear as President Uhuru Kenyatta will win the rematch in a landslide. NASA leader Raila Odinga withdrew from the race but his name was in the ballot paper during Thursday’s poll. Raila had asked his supporters to boycott the repeat election. The former Prime Minister said it is only through his withdrawal that the country will have a free and fair election as per the law. When he withdrew, Raila said the IEBC had stonewalled meaningful deliberations on necessary reforms to ensure the election is free and fair. Ndegwa said opposition strongholds, where the voting did not take place, are still part of Kenya and are going to be governed under the Constitution. Four counties in Nyanza – Homa Bay, parts of Migori, Kisumu and Siaya – did not participate in last Thursday’s voting.
