Malawi President Peter
Mutharika on Friday warned suspected vampires to stop
terrorising people and told village chiefs to stamp down on
witchcraft. His calls came as a vampire scare in two districts triggered
mob violence and left six people dead. Lynch mobs accusing
people of vampirism have been on the rampage since
mid-September. "If people are using witchcraft to suck people's blood, I
will deal with them and I ask them to stop doing that with
immediate effect," Mutharika told a community gathering leaders
in Mulanje, a district with the highest incidences. On Monday the United Nations pulled staff out of two
districts that have been swept up in the violence. Belief in witchcraft is widespread in rural Malawi, one of
the world's poorest countries, where many aid agencies and NGO's
work. A spate of vigilante violence linked to a vampire rumours
also erupted in Malawi in 2002.
