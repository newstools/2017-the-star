A man suspected to have stolen a sheep in Iten escaped death by a whisker after angry residents attempted to lynch him. Gideon Kiplagat was spotted taking the stolen sheep to an abattoir yesterday. He was rescued by Irong chief Charles Kigen.  Kigen was forced to carry the sheep to Iten police station. The sheep belongs to a retired Education officer, Philip Limo. “This is not the first time he is arrested for stealing livestock,” Kigen said.  “He admitted he was going to sell the stolen sheep and sought forgiveness from the mob. We let police to carry out investigations. He will appear in court on Thursday [today] ,” the chief said.  The suspect is alleged to have jumped over a fence on Limo’s farm before stealing the sheep on Tuesday night.
