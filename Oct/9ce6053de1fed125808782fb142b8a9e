West Africans, especially those from Nigerian and Ghana, seem to be taking their music quite seriously. They are releasing well-packaged projects, whose tracks are a clear indication of improved production. They are keen to detail and have dominated playlists all over Africa. An artistâ€™s breakthrough can be a tricky landmark. However, some up-and-coming artistes are cautiously following in the steps of their predecessors and expressing growth at a favoUrable pace. One such artiste is Bryan The Mensah, who is trying to redefine the game by rapping his way to the top of the list. It only takes you a minute into Bryanâ€™s debut album for you to realise the kind of talent he is gifted with. The young Ghanaian rapper has certainly been waiting for this moment, one where he has carefully taken a milestone step in his legacy building. For the most part, he keeps it contemporary enough to stay trendy. The 28-minute project features guest appearances on all tracks except two. He brings Seyyoh on the first track, â€œGood Designâ€, and on the fourth track â€œAll This Lifeâ€. He also taps verses from Tano Jackson and Kwesi Arthur on the tracks â€œLast Decemberâ€ and â€œDarling Fallingâ€. Other featured artistes include Jayso, Tim Lyre and Fii. He has just started and would be safe to assume that he is on the right track. His release is a purposeful statement of intent, one where he is certainly settling into himself. It is expected that with time, should he make the right choices, he will be pitted against greats such as Sarkodie and M.anifest. From this release, it is evident that the artist has expressed top priority in developing his talent and has gathered up all his charm. This is an amazing start, and â€œFriends with the Sunâ€ is the best and boldest thing heâ€™s made so far. At this point, what we do is wait and see how far he takes this. Star Rating: 3.5/5
