Busia KDF retirees have formed an association to help resolve numerous problems they face after retirement.  KDF Retirees Association chairman Pius Ikaal said, “Our former bosses had raised concerns that most of the retirees disappear into oblivion.  It is becoming difficult to trace them.” He said each member is supposed to contribute Sh500 every month.  Ikaal on Saturday said some of the challenges ex-soldiers face are delayed remittance of their pensions by some banks and the false notion that they are not on good terms with local administrations.
