Starring: Iain Armitage, Zoe Perry, Lance Barber, Montana Jordan, Raegan Revord, Jim Parsons CREATED BY: Chuck Lorre & Steven Molaro genre: Comedy Release date: September 25 Ten years ago, we fell in love with the quirky, highly intelligent but poorly sociable Sheldon Cooper on CBSâ€™s The Big Bang Theory. According to Jim Parsonsâ€™ story, the actor was so invested in Sheldonâ€™s life that he approached creators Chuck Lorre and Steven Molaro with the idea of a spin-off focused on Sheldonâ€™s early years. As the title suggests, the show chronicles the life of a young, highly intelligent Sheldon growing up in Texas with his overly religious mother Mary, his father George, his older brother George Junior and his overly aggressive twin sister Missy. Sheldon, nine, starts high school with his older brother, who is less than enthused about it. Sheldonâ€™s overzealous nature rubs off wrongly on the teachers. Sheldon realises he overestimated school to be a â€˜safe havenâ€™ of education and intellect. For those of us invested in the life of Sheldon this last 10 years, the show is a flashback of sorts into Sheldonâ€™s earlier life before we knew him as the loveable nerd. And of course as Jim Parsons narrates the story, it really does feel like we are watching the current Sheldon remember his childhood. And as such the show maintains all the loveable qualities we got from The Big Bang Theory. But the cast do really bring something new and exciting to the table. An interesting fact about this show is that Zoe Perry, who portrays Sheldonâ€™s mother in this show, is the actual daughter of Laurie Metcalf, who plays Sheldonâ€™s mother on The Big Bang Theory! So far the show has only aired one episode and the rest of the show will continue the weekly broadcast from November 2, so be sure to catch it. Star Rating:  4/5
