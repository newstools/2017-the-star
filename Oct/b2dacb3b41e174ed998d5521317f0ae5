Seventeen people were admitted to various hospitals in Embu with cholera-like symptoms. The county director of Health, Dr Peter Kaniaru, said three cases have been confirmed to be cholera. Embu Health executive Dr Jamleck Muturi said the patients have been admitted to Embu Level Five Teaching and Referral Hospital, Runyemjes and Kiritiri hospitals. They were vomiting and diarrhoering. Muturi said 10 patients are still in hospital but seven were treated and discharged. They are suspected to have either eaten food or water contaminated with vibrio cholerae - the bacteria that causes cholera. Muturi advised residents to boil drinking water, cook food properly and maintain basic hygiene by washing hands after visiting the toilet. Contaminated water is the main cause of the disease, he said. Muturi said residents infected in Runyenjes are suspected to have used water from Ena Water Project and from Thuci River. The water is not treated. The patients from Grogon, Embu town, may have drank water from the Rupingazi River or from wells. Water companies, including Embu Water and Sanitation Company and Kyieni Water Project, were urged to treat water with chlorine. The department has banned hawking of food in Embu town to curb the spread of the disease. Cooking of food for mourners during burials has also been banned. Muturi urged residents to comply with their instructions. “Please cooperate to help prevent the further spreading of the disease,” Muturi said. Kaniaru urged residents to rush to hospital whenever they experience symptoms of vomiting and diarrhoea. He said if the disease is not treated quickly, it can kill in hours. He added that the county health department was offering free aqua tabs to residents, especially in areas people have been infected.
