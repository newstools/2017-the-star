African champions Malkia strikers begun their title defence on a resounding note with an easy 3-0 win against Nigeria as the African Nation Cup-cum World championship qualifier got underway in Yauonde, Cameroon on Saturday. The side coached by Japheth Munala who have been drawn in a favorable Pool 'B' in the week long event will battle Senegal on Sunday at 6:00 pm in their second match. Senegal also recorded their first win of the event in the early kick off against Congo RD 3-1(25-21,21-25,25-21,25-15). Munala paraded celebrity setter Jannet Wanja, Brackcidise Agala, Edith Wisa, Noel Murambi, Violet Makuto, captain Mercy Moim and libero Aggripina Kundu to do duty for the East Africans. The nine time champions begun slowly but gained momentum with the reigning African most valuable player Makuto, Agala, Murambi and Wanja combining well upfront as Kenya squeezed 8-7 lead at the first technical time out. Kenya extended the lead to 17-13 and 20-13 before they bagged the first set 25-16. In the second set, Kenya took an early lead 8-0 thanks to tough services from Wanja. Munala rested Wanja, Makuto and Wisa for flamboyant and well exposed setter Jane Wacu, debutant Immaculate Chemtai and Kenya Volleyball Federation Most Valuable Player award Triza Atuka. The East Africans continued with their domination in the second set against the hapless West Africans who were without a coach as they opened a 10 point gap 14-4. Wacu, Atuka and Murambi impressed enroute bagging the set 25-8. The script was not any different in the third set as Murambi and Agala returned to haunt the West Africans with their powerful attacks and watertight blocks to lead 6-4 and 16-10. Munala then rested Murambi and Moim for utility player Leonida Kasaya and Evelyne Makuto. Chemtai, Atuka and Wacu combined well as they bagged points at will to lead 20-10 before they sealed the win with 25-10. At the end of the tournament, the top two teams will book tickets to next year's World Championship in Japan.
