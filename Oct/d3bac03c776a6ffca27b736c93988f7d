Opposition leader Raila Odinga has asked his supporters not to protest but boycott the October 28 presidential election in Nyanza. Speaking to Citizen in an interview on Friday, Raila said holding elections in four areas only was ethnic profiling that must be condemned. IEBC chair Wafula Chebukati said voting in Homa Bay, Migori, Kisumu and Siaya, where protests were rife, will be repeated on Saturday. He told the press on Thursday that he had written to IG Joseph Boinnet to provide enough security for the exercise.

The Opposition leader rubbished the presidential election and urged his supporters to maintain peace, adidng he will communicate the way forward soon. ODM elections director Junet Mohamed also accused IEBC of ethnic profiling saying their supporters will not vote. "That is creating the impression that there was voting in other areas.
