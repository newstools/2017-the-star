Kenya will continue to vaccinate children for polio even though there have been no cases here since 2013 ( see Page 11). However Nigeria had an outbreak in 2016. The WHO says that Africa cannot be certified polio-free until there has been no case in any African country for at least three years. Kenya is right to cooperate with the WHO on the mass vaccination for polio. The polio virus can cause paralysis, permanent disability and in some cases death through not being able to breathe properly. All of us have seen people disabled by polio. Why would we run the risk of having that happen to our children? There has been a lot of fake news about polio vaccine ( often spread by al Qaeda or al Shabaab) but in reality it is completely safe.   In Europe and America there have been no cases of polio since the 1950s yet children are still vaccinated for polio. So let's keep vaccinating our children to protect them from polio. Quote of the day: "Every child is an artist. The problem is how to remain an artist once we grow up." -Spanish artist Pablo Picasso was born on 25 October, 1881
