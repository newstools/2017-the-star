The Electoral and Boundaries Commission yesterday declared Uhuru Kenyatta President-elect following the repeat presidential polls on October 26 ordered by the Supreme Court. Going forward, Kenyans now undoubtedly know they live in a divided country and the greatest responsibility will lie on the winner of the 12th General Election to reconcile and reunite Kenyans. In his second and final term, President Kenyatta should not remain captive to his hardline strategists and closest advisers. He should aspire to be seen as the Father of the Nation, serving all Kenyans, including those who boycotted the vote. And if he has a ptoblem with the National Super Alliance leaders, especially the main principal, former Prime Minister Raila Odinga, who dropped out of the repeat presidential race and urged others no to vote, he should put every effort into serving their supporters. This is the term Uhuru will chart his legacy and he needs to put a supreme effort into serving all Kenyans and forming an inclusive administration.
