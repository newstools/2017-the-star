Twenty youths were arrested in Kakamega county on Thursday during the repeat presidential election. They were arrested in Shinyalu subcounty, Kakamega town and Butere.  This was after they attempted to block voters from casting votes and barricaded roads. Police engaged the youths in running battles for hours as the vote tallying went on.  Western region police commander Moses Ombati said those arrested will be charged with various offences, including obstructing people from voting and destruction of property.  Ombati said police consider those arrested criminals, not demonstrators, since NASA chief Raila Odinga had asked his supporters to remain at home during the repeat poll.  Youths also blocked the Webuye-Kakamega road using stones and logs and engaged police in a cat and mouse game for hours. Police fired tear gas and shot in the air to disperse them, before clearing the road.  The youths then shifted to the Kakamega-Mumias road, where they also lit bonfires. Police dispersed them and restored traffic flow at 10pm.  No fatalities or injuries were reported during the confrontations. Ombati said they will ensure those arrested are subjected to the law to serve as an example to the rest.  In Shinyalu market, Ombati said, a National Youth Service officer was accidentally shot in the foot by an officer at a polling station. “A police officer had given his gun to the NYS officer at the centre to answer a call of nature. When he returned, he wanted to establish whether the gun had been misused and in the process he accidentally injured the NYS officer,” he said.
