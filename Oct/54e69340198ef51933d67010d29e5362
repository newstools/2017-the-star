Parliament passed an amendment to the country’s election laws on Wednesday, sayingif one candidate withdraws from a repeat presidential election, the other one would automatically win. The amendment was heavily criticised by the Opposition, whose legislators boycotted the vote. NASA leader Raila Odinga withdrew from a repeat presidential vote scheduled for October 26 on Tuesday, citing concerns over fairness and transparency. The law must now be signed by the President.  The President said he "will not hesitate" to sign the election laws amendment Bill into law. Uhuru defended the Bill on Tuesday, saying its contents echo matters raised by the Opposition so it is surprising its leaders are against it. "I have no problem with that law and if Parliament passes the bill, I will sign it," he told Kaloleni residents. "I don’t have any problem with it because in it are the contentious issues the Opposition raised." The President is expected to sign the law on Thursday or Friday. Read: I'll sign elections law, Bill covers NASA's issues, says Uhuru
