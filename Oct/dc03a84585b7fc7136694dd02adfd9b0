Marsabit nurses are expected to end their three-month strike today, Governor Mohammud Ali has said. The county government has been holding talks with the striking nurses. Ali said he would meet the nurses today. The county boss expressed confidence that the medical staff would sign a return-to-work deal and resume their duties to help in the war on a malaria outbreak that has hit the county and left at least 30 residents dead. Ali pledged to supply modern equipment to health facilities, motivate nurses and improve working conditions to enable health workers to provide high quality services. â€œIâ€™m confident they will all return to work to help our people at this critical time,â€ he said on Thursday, praising the nurses who have been serving residents since the infections broke out.
