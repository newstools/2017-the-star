Dettol has partnered with celebrities Talia Oyando and Grace Msalame to create awareness on hygiene during the Global Handwashing Month. The two will engage mothers and their children countrywide on the importance of handwashing. Reckitt Benckiser East Africa country manager Sachin Varma said, “Talia and Grace are the perfect partners for Dettol as we strive to entrench the handwashing culture across the country. Grace will be working with her celebrated twins to push the brand in family setting.  “As a mother, I am the overall guardian of good hygiene habits in the home, and thus I believe this partnership will build hygiene consciousness countrywide,” she said.
