Burundi's cabinet has adopted draft legislation seeking to amend the constitution, potentially allowing President Pierre Nkurunziza to rule up to 2034. This was the report by a senior government official on Friday. Unrest triggered by Nkuruzinza's continued rule has already gripped Burundi for two and a half years, leaving the economy moribund, killing hundreds and forcing about 400,000 people to seek safety in neighbouring countries. The official, who requested anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media, told Reuters the draft legislation was adopted on Tuesday. Regarding the ICC and crimes against humanity, Burundi is officially the first country to withdraw from the Hague-based court following a notice a year ago but key rights groups are displeased. The pullout takes effect Friday, after Nkurunziza signed a decree in 2016. Under the Rome Statute, the ICC's founding treaty, withdrawal takes effect a year after notification. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have criticised the country for the move. More on this: Burundi first country to quit ICC, Amnesty and HRW unhappy
